CHENNAI: Chennai may be facing one of its worst water crises in decades with its main reservoirs bone dry, but at one corner of Puzhal lake, one of the city's drinking water sources, sewage is being let out from an unfinished storm water drain.

 A team of activists from  , a Chennai-based group which is carrying out audit of water bodies across the city, on Saturday inspected residential colonies built near the lake near the Ambattur Red Hills Road.
 
 Near West Balaji Nagar, a colony with around 500 households, a storm water drain leads to the lake bed.However, dark and foul smelling sewage flows out of the incomplete channel, meandering its way into the lake bed.
 
 “The residents of the area either don't have sewage connections or the sewage lines have not yet been connected to the main pipeline. Because of this, the sewage is being let into the storm water drain polluting the Puzhal lake,“ said M  , consultative body member of Arappor Iyakkam.
 
 This is a prime example of how areas on the fringes of   are struggling with basic amenities despite years after coming within the corporation limits, he said. “This is a collective failure of the corporation and  , as the storm water drain is also incomplete,“ said Chandramohan.
 
 Corporation officials have in the past acknowledged that residents use storm water drains to channel sewage which then finds its way into the city's water bodies. However, the corporation is yet to take any action. A local Metrowater official said they would look into the issue and take corrective action.
