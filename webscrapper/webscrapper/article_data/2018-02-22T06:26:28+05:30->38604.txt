GANDHINAGAR: The   has hit the drawing board to draft a policy promoting   Prime Minister Narendra Modi had caused a buzz about seaplanes when he used one to fly from the   in Ahmedabad to Dharoi dam near Ambaji in December 2017, on the last day of campaigning for the 2017 assembly polls. The government has appointed a consultant to identify sites for possible seaplane tourism.

 A source privy to the development said, “After the response to the PM’s flight by seaplane from the Sabarmati riverfront to Dharoi dam, the possibility of a new tourism avenue has opened up. The government of India has also proposed a scheme in the Union budget, under which we expect incentives.”
 
 “To promote regional air travel in the state, we are giving VGF (viability gap funding) and other incentives. Under the proposed policy for seaplanes, we have proposed similar or greater VGF for vendors starting seaplane services. We expect financial assistance from the government of India too. A detailed field report about   possibilities is expected to be ready soon.”
 
 “There are several likely sites like the Sabarmati riverfront, Dharoi dam, the Sardar Sarovar dam, Somnath, Bet-Dwarka, Saputara, Gandhinagar, Aji dam (Rajkot), Mandvi (Kutch) and a few places in South Gujarat where seaplane services can be started. With amphibious planes we see huge growth potential. It is more cost-effective than regular planes as as airports or land and other infrastructure are not needed. Only a small jetty like structure is needed to fly and land. The government has allocated Rs 1 crore for preparatory work. After a contract is signed, the government may need to spent Rs 6 to 7 crore a year as VGF subsidy. There is massive scope for development as a tourist attraction,” added the source.
