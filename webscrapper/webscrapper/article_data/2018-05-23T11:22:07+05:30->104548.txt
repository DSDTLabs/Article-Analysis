BATHINDA:   DC Sumit Jarangal has claimed that all 92 samples taken from the waterworks of Malout area of Muktsar are safe and potable. On Tuesday, he visited   and   and assessed the water situation in the district. He said that the water situation in the canals had now become normal.

 
 The water supply and sanitation department in the district had earlier been alerted that the water from the canals should not be supplied to the water works. The department has still been asked to assess the samples of drinking water as a preventive step even though these samples were found to be fit during analysis. The DC further said that the quality of water had improved in the canals now.
