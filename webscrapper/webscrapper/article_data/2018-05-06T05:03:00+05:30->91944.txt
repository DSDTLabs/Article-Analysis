Belagavi: In a major development, the warring factions of the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti ( ), which have fielded their candidates separately in four assembly constancies- three of Belagavi and one in Khanapur, have decided to join hands and support only one candidate in each constituency.

 The factions led by Kiran Thakur and Deepak Dalavi, held a meeting in the presence of hundreds of party workers at Anasuya Mangal Karyalay here on Saturday and expressed their willingness to supporting a single candidate in each constituency by having a mutual understanding.
 
 Both Thakur and Dalavi said the factions are fighting for the merger of 856 villages and Belagavi with Maharashtra but using different ways. Both ways are right, like the ways of Mahatma Gandhi and Balgangadhar Tilak during the freedom movement, they said.
 
 Both leaders said if a single candidate is fielded, MES can win all four seats otherwise votes will be divided between MES candidates and both will lose. 
 
 The leaders assured to hold meetings with their respective candidates and come out with the result soon.
 
 With polling day just a week away, Saturdayâ€™s decision is going to be a game changer. This swift development will trouble candidates of national parties who were trying to take advantage of the split in MES.
