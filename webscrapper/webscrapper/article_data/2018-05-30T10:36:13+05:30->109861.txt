CHENNAI: With the entire opposition boycotting the House, the assembly session was a smooth affair for the ruling  . The ruling party MLAs got enough time to speak, that too without interruptions. Forest minister Dindigul C Sreenivasan whose department's demand came up for debate on Tuesday, heaped encomiums on chief minister  , comparing him to former chief ministers C N Annadurai and   for managing the party and government "so efficiently". 

 
 Earlier, the lengthy reply of the chief minister when he defended his government's action in ordering police firing and judicial probe was interrupted for a few minutes to allow Sreenivasan and information technology M Manikandan to move their departments' demands. 
 
 Soon after Palaniswami finished his reply, the speaker allowed the AIADMK MLAs to speak on the demands for grants for the two departments. They had a field day praising Jayalalithaa, Palaniswami and deputy CM O Panneerselvam and criticising the DMK MLAs in their absence. 
 
 For their part, the ministers were spared from questions and jibes of the opposition members and were seen relaxing and sipping on hot coffee and tea. 
 
 "In 1967 when (DMK founder) C N Annadurai assumed charge (after his party won the assembly election), he gave a speech in the assembly, saying the   was unable to come to terms with their defeat in the election. Similarly now, the opposition just cannot believe that the AIADMK government after Jayalalithaa has completed one year. Opposition parties even consulted 'kili josiyars' (soothsayers with parrots) and 'eli' (astrologers with rats) about when the government will fall, but that did not happen," said Sreenivasan. 
 
 He devoted a good part of his speech to heaping prais on EPS. "Palaniswami is a simple chief minister but has taken some important and tough decisions like closing down the Sterlite factory in Tuticorin and sealing it," said Sreenivasan," he said.
