This Friday, director   hit the floors for the final take of his career’s first magnum opus that stars   opposite him in the lead. Sadly, a bevy of bouncers at the venue —   near Budge Budge — ensured that no scribe or photographer got a candid shot of what transpired inside the sprawling compound. In fact, the whole production has been kept under wraps after its hush-hush muhurat on March 6. Yes, Raj and Subhashree finally exchanged garlands and vows at the palatial rajbari on Friday after taking T-town by surprise in March with their secret ring ceremony. Even the strong nor’wester on Friday evening couldn’t put a spanner on the ceremony, though there was some minor damage to the decorations. According to sources, the couple had an elaborate Bengali wedding ceremony that kickstarted with a gaye holud ceremony in the morning. The final round began around 9 pm, when the couple came down to the rajbari courtyard. Sources said Subhashree looked like a dream in a red designer Benarasi. “Raj was wearing a dark green panjabi and was doing bhangra. It was fun,” a source told us. The wedding finally started around 11 pm after an elaborate ashirbaad. The guests — around 300 family members and friends, according to the sources — started pouring in from 8 pm. “We’ve been planning for this day and it’s finally here,” said actress  , who came with director Abhimanyu Mukherjee. Actors   Bose and   came a while later. “It is a beautiful wedding. I’m stunned to see how the couple has gone for such elaborate rituals without any shortcut,” Anindita said. Actor  , one of the closest friends of the couple, arrived quite late. “I was shooting,” he said, adding “I know I’ll have to answer to them, but I’ll compensate by staying here tonight.”
Raj and Subhashree will reach the city on Saturday to host an elaborate reception on Sunday.
