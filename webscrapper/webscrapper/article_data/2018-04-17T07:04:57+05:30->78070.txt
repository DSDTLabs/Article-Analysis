BENGALURU: Two siblings, both  , were   by a woman on the pretext of getting them jobs in an IT company. The two were paid Rs 18,000 each as salary for a month before the firm closed operations in the city. 

  Arpita Hegde and her sister Poojita told Whitefield police that they were cheated by a woman named Neha, who allegedly promised them a job in a software company in return for money. Arpita told police that it began with an SMS advertising job opportunities for BE and BTech graduates she received in November last year. The message contained two mobile numbers. She said she called one of the numbers and the woman who answered identified herself as Neha. 
 
  Neha told Arpita that an IT firm was looking for software developers and demanded Rs 1.5 lakh to ensure she gets the job. Arpita discussed the matter with her parents and decided that she and her sister would apply. 
 
  Arpita and her sister met Neha at a mall in Kundalahalli on November 26 last year. They paid Neha Rs 3 lakh in return for jobs for both of them. Neha arranged interviews for the siblings, and a few days later, the duo received offer letters. They were each offered a monthly pay of Rs 18,000 during a three-month training period and were promised Rs 30,000 per month on completion of training. 
 
  Not long after they got their first salary, the duo received an email communication from the company stating the firm was shifting to Noida and the duo had to move there. Arpita called Neha and told her that she and her sister could not shift to Noida and asked for their money back. 
 
  After days of hedging and promising, Neha's mobile eventually could not be reached. The office where the women were interviewed had closed. Police have registered a case of cheating against Neha - no case has been filed against the firm - and investigations are on.
