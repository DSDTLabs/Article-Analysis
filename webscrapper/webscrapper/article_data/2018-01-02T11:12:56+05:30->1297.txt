NEW DELHI: Today he remains sidelined by Indian cricket authorities, but in December 2006 the Kerala fast bowler   was on top of the world after helping India win a Test on South African soil for the first time. 

 At the Wanderers, he bowled what will rank as one of the finest spells by an Indian fast bowler, claiming 5/40 to bowl   out for 84 - their lowest total since readmission to international cricket - after India made 249. His wickets were skipper Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher and Shaun Pollock in a dream spell that shoved the hosts out of the first Test. 
 
 So masterful was Sreesanth’s performance, that   was moved to comment that he had not seen even the great Glenn McGrath bowl with the seam so upright delivery after delivery. Sreesanth added three wickets in South Africa’s second innings to add to his unforgettable Man-of-the-Match performance.
