Kolkata: A 62-year-old Uttar Pradesh resident, who collapsed while taking a dip in   on Makar Sankranti, was airlifted to Kolkata and admitted in NRS Hospital on Saturday. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, after receiving the SOS from South 24-Parganas DM, intervened to shift Ganga Prasad, who had suffered a cardiac arrest. 

 The Gazipur resident was first treated at the makeshift medical facilities on Ganga Sagar premises, where he was put on ventilators. But when DM P B Salim learnt Prasad was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he reached out to his seniors in the administration, including the CM. The Pawan Hans helicopter, converted into an ambulance kept on stand-by, was used to fly in the patient to Behala. 
 
 An ambulance then brought him to NRS Medical College and Hospital. 
 
 “The patient is stable thanks to timely support from transport and the health department,” DM Salim said.
