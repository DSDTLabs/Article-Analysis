GURUGRAM: Negligence of a truck driver proved costly for two bikers, who died on the spot when they rammed their motorcycle into a stationary truck at   flyover on Sunday night. According to the police, the deceased have been identified as Arvind Thakur (24), a resident of Delhi, and Santosh Sharma (29), a resident of Naharpur Rupa village. 

  The two were travelling to Delhi on Arvind’s Splender iSmart bike around 10.30 pm on Sunday when the accident happened. When they reached Panchgaon Chowk, the duo didn’t notice the truck which was parked in the middle of the road without any warning signal.
