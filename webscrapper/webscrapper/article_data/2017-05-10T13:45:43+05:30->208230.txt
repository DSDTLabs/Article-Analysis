JAIPUR: Solar tariffs crashed to new lows beating the previous record of Rs 2.97 per unit. In a reverse auction bidding held last evening, Phelan Energy Group and Avaada Power offered to sell solar energy to Rajasthan government at Rs 2.62 per unit and won the contracts for 100 MW each. SBG Cleantech won the rest 50 MW at Rs 2.63.

  ( ) had put up 250 MW for auction for Rajasthan government and the plants would be located in Adani Solar Park at Bhadla, near Jodhpur.
 
 The previous lowest price of Rs 2.97 was quoted by Mahindra Renewables and Acme Solar for 750 MW Rewa solar park in Madhya Pradesh in February this year even though the average tariff would come to Rs 3.30 per unit for 15 years.
 
 After the biddings,  , power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister, tweeted, “Another milestone towards PM @narendramodi's vision of clean affordable power for all: Bhadla Solar Park achieves tariff of Rs. 2.62/unit.”
 
 In a recent report, Bridge to India, a solar energy think tank, said India is seen to become the third largest solar market in 2017 with 8.8 gigawatt of capacity addition projected for the year, overtaking Japan.
 
 In the last financial year, solar energy installed capacity went up by 2250 MW to 9012 from 6762 MW. Tamil Nadu leads the states with capacity of 1590 MW followed by Rajasthan at 1917 MW.
 
 While the industry is playing along the Centre’s ambitious target of 100 GW by 2022, there is a concern of the ultra-low tariffs not becoming sustainable. As per the latest biddings, the solar energy is cheaper than coal-fired thermal power.
 
 But Sunil Bansal, general secretary of Rajasthan Solar Association, said, “The cost of funding has also come down significantly which is reflected in the lower level tariffs. Economy of scale and lower finance cost are driving down prices.”
