 If you have been using your partner’s or sister’s face cleanser to clean your mug, or worse, just the regular bath soap, it’s time to rethink your face cleansing ritual. A good face wash is not just good marketing but good skin sense. Skin experts’ advice on upping your skincare game because washing your face is not as easy as using soap and water. A face washing primer for all you men out there...
  
  
 
  Yes. Men’s skin is harder and rougher than women’s, so look for a good facial cleanser. Also, the bath soap you’ve been using may be keeping you squeaky clean but it’s robbing your facial skin of a good pH balance. In short, it’s drying up your skin and leaving it open to open pores and premature ageing.
  
  
 
  No. Men need a different face wash but you have to select your poison based on your skin type – dry, oily, combination or sensitive skin. You need to consider individual skin type and texture before buying a face wash. If you are confused, visit a dermatologist or figure it out, you are a smart man. Just remember oily skin may require a face wash containing salicylic, glycolic, lactic acid. Dry skin needs a mild face wash which is free of alcohol and is non-foaming to hydrate your skin. Read the label carefully.
  
  
 
  Well, it’s not rocket science but then, except rocket science nothing is. However, men mess up face washing too. Here’s washing up 101 for you: Be gentle because it’s your mug not your coffee mug. Before you start cleaning your face, give your hands a thorough clean-up. Then, wet face and take a fingertip amount of face wash. Rub it on the face gently, avoiding the eye area. Use circular motions when massaging for at least a minute for thorough clean-up. Rinse with cold water and pat dry.
  
  
 
  Yes. Just like your teeth and your hands, your face too requires more than a daily rinse. Wash your face twice a day – morning and at night before turning in. Never use hot water, though avoid washing with extremely cold water too. Cold water can irritate the skin. Set the temperature to lukewarm.
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  - Scrub 1-2 times a week, after cleansing your face and then follow with a face mask.
  - Follow up cleansing with a mild moisturiser, again depending on your skin type.
  - Use sunscreen with SPF 30 at least, eye cream and anti-aging cream to reduce all kinds of facial problems.
  - Use rose water after shaving.
  - Maintain a proper diet which is good for your health and skin.
