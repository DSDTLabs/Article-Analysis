Actress  , who shot to fame with Navya..Naye Dhadkan Naye Sawaal, was in Lucknow recently to promote her serial Kullfi Kumarr Bajewala. On her visit, Shruti, a UPite, revealed that she had some close relatives in the city. "I am a proud UPite. I belong to Meerut. My maasi stays in Lucknow. I met them in the evening and had we had a small dinner together at maasi’s place,” said Shruti, adding, “I used to come to Lucknow quite often during my childhood. This time I have come here after a very long time and so the only place I still remember is  , as I used to go there with my cousins. Another thing that I clearly remember about Lucknow is yahaan ki yummy basket chaat. I haven't eaten anything like that kahin bhi. The   is so unique to Lucknow! Anyone from UP settled elsewhere, and who is a foodie, will definitely miss the chatpati chaat that we get here. Chahe   ho ya fir Lucknow, UP ki chatpati chaat ki baat hi alag hai!"
For this NIFT-Delhi passout, acting is something that she always wanted to do. "Even though I am from Meerut, I have studied in Delhi and Jaipur. While I was studying in Jaipur, I did a play there. Seeing me in the play, people told me that I should try my luck in acting as I was good at it. So, I decided to pack my bags and headed to Mumbai. Initially my parents were shocked and mere ghar pe bahut saare television show type drama hua. My dad and I used to fight a lot over this decision of mine while my mom used to be pacifying both of us," she laughed, adding, "My dad was apprehensive because of the image the entertainment industry had though I haven’t encountered any bad experience with anyone so far. I think this is a wonderful place to work, for anyone. Also, my father, being from a middle class family, was used to getting a salary at the end of the month, and wasn’t used to this kind of profession. But finally all is well now between us."
