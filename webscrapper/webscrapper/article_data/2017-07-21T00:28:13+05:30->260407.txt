Mumbai: Fighting against all odds to release the results of lakhs of students by month-end as directed by the governor, the   has drawn up two plans— one is seeking   and the other being declaring five days as   so that more teachers can participate in the   process. 

 Vinayak Dalvie, officer-on-special duty for examination work, said the university has discussed the possibility of taking help from other state universities, but nothing has been finalized. “We will have to first look at the provisions (in the Maharashtra Public Universities Act), if the need arises. If at all we seek help in assessment, moderation will still be done by our teachers to ensure standardization,” said Dalvie. Also, a source said, with the main server in Mumbai, it may take long to download answer sheets in other universities that may have slow internet speed.
 
 On the university’s Plan B to declare five days as non-instructional, a senior MU officer said, “Currently 50,000-60,000 papers are assessed every day. But if we declare five non-instructional days, teachers can spend the entire time evaluating papers and then if 80,000-90,000 papers are checked a day, we can declare the results in time.” Currently, faculty members take lectures till afternoon and spend the rest of the day checking answer sheets. 
 
 Commerce and law streams have the largest number of unassessed answer sheets. “It may not be possible to complete the entire assessment before July 31 and abide by the governor’s  ,” said an MU officer. “Pushing teachers, serving them notices on a daily basis, asking principals to send more faculty for evaluation, has all not helped much.” But controller of examinations Deepak Wasave claimed, “Almost 95% evaluation in technology is complete, and 90% in science. About 50% evaluation has been completed in commerce and 65% in arts.”
