PANAJI: Recognising the ubiquty of smartphones and tablets, the Archdiocese of Goa has added another dimension to facilitate easy access to the Word of Goa — this time, by launching an   that has the entire text of the Bible in Konkani. 
 
  
 
 The app, named ‘Povitr Pustok, a Konkani Bible app’ is expected to help the laity and others, especially the Goan diaspora who find it difficult to obtain Bibles in their mother tongue, to keep the Word of God at hand at all times.
 
 “I am extremely happy to launch this app, which will enable our faithful to read the Konkani Bible faithfully,” said Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao, who released the app on Monday at his house in Altinho. 
 
 The Archdiocese created this app through the Centre for Biblical Apostolate with a few collaborators. A source told TOI that the app was developed by Patrick Lobo and Bianca Rebello with support from Fr Carmo Martins, who is in charge of the Margao deanery. 
 
 The Android app can be downloaded tfrom the Google Play store and also from archgoadaman.com, the official website of the Archdiocese. “It’s user friendly, has many features, and is easy to access,” a Church official said. One interesting feature of the Bible in the app is that all sayings by Jesus are highlighted in red.
 
 The Catholic church in Goa began its pioneering efforts to translate the Bible into Konkani in the early 1970s. Initially, it was only the   (Novo Korar). The first edition, with a print order of 25,000 copies, was published in 1974. The Novo Korar would later see seven reprints, the last in 2013, and over 2.2 lakh more copies.
 
 Around two decades ago, Church authorities completed the process of translating the Old Testament to Konkani. “A total of 60,000 copies of the first edition were released in 2006, and the second reprint in 2010 saw an additional 40,000 copies being printed,” a Church official said.
