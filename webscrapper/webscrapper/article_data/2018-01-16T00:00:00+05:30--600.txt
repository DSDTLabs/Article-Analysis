 has been the pick of filmmakers when it comes to playing unconventional characters and to her credit she has aced the roles that have come her way. Her upcoming challenge would be playing an   driver in cinematographer-turned-filmmaker Sujith Vaassudev’s  , the colloquial pronounciation of auto rickshaw.

 The movie will have Anusree as the only leading actor along with an ensemble cast featuring relative newcomers. Sujith tells us, “Anusree’s character drives the film but the movie tells the tale of the common people who travel as passengers in her auto rickshaw. It will have realistic humour and drama that happen in a normal person’s day-to-day life.”
 
 The film, which is scripted by Marimayam fame Jayaraj Mitra, will be extensively shot within the auto rickshaw, says Sujith. “We will have three to four cameras set up to get the various angles of those travelling as their story is the crux of the movie,” he says.
 
 While the film will be extensively shot inside the auto rickshaw, the director says another prominent location will be an auto stand. “We are looking at a location either in Kannur or Kozhikode,” he says, adding that the movie will go on floors by February last week.
 
 Meanwhile, Anusree is currently busy with Ramesh Pisharody’s Panchavarnathatha. She is also part of Pranav Mohanlal’s  .
