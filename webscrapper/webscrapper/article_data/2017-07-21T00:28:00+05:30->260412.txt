Pune: The civic body has ordered an inquiry into an impersonation case in the property tax department. The decision was taken at the general body meeting of PMC on Thursday.

 Elected members on Wednesday had caught an individual   as a civic official attached to the property tax department. He was luring property owners and collecting money from them claiming that he would help them get their work with the civic administration done. 
 
 “Fraudsters come to PMC building and use the civic infrastructure. They operate the computers of the property tax department and cheat people. Who granted him the access and what are the civic officials of this department doing?” elected members said in the general body.
 
 Municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar said the civic administration has taken cognizance of the matter. “Criminal charges will be filed against the person. An inquiry has been ordered. The report will be tabled before the general body,” he said.
 
 Property tax is among the key sources of income for the civic body. According to civic officials, property tax is collected from around 8.3 lakh properties. Of these, nearly one lakh are commercial properties while there are around 7 lakh residential buildings. Pune also has 29,000 open plots and the rest 14,000 include commercial, residential and open properties.
 
 The civic body's tax collection target for the last fiscal was Rs1,600 crore. But it could earn only around Rs1,200 crore. The target for the 2017-18 financial year is Rs1333 crore
