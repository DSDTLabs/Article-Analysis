Bhopal: The School Management Committee (SMC) meetings will be held in government schools across the state on Saturday, offering parents and other stakeholders a platform to voice their concerns.

 The Rajya Shiksha Kendra (RSK), Bhopal had issued orders to all government schools in the state for formation of SMC before July 1.
 
 This is the first time SMC meetings will be held after the formation of committees. There are over 1 lakh schools across the state, including 1,173 in the state capital.
 
 Issues related to responsibility of SMC, students dropping out, absenteeism among students and teacher, pupil-teacher ratio will be discussed at the meeting.
 
 According to a statement issued by RSK, “The SMC meet initiative will make the government more accountable to the parents of children who are studying in government schools. It will provide a platform to members to raise their concerns with officials to ensure effective and speedy resolution.”
 
 The statement says the SMCs would play a constructive role in improving the condition of government schools in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 “This is the first time that students, parents and teachers will be on a single platform to discuss and resolve their problems. SMCs will change the way MP government schools function and the meeting will make the government directly answerable to children who study in government schools,” the statement further says.
 
 SMCs have been formed in all the primary and middle schools under the Right to Education Act.
 
 Each committee comprises 18 members including parents, head masters, teachers, local public representative and a woman public representative. SMC will have a tenure of two years.
 
 The committees will be responsible for monitoring of quality of education, student-teacher presence in schools and implementation of government orders.
