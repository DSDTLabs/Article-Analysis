NEW DELHI:   leader   Yadav spoke on implementation of the UGC notification, 2016, on the third day of Jawaharlal Nehru University’s 6-day   series on democracy and social justice, access and equality. 

 Addressing the audience on Friday, Yadav said that the “vice-chancellor is lying”. He said that according to the UGC notification, it is the discretion of the university if it wants to continue the reservation policy that it has followed for all these years.
 
 Yadav said the UGC notification was brought about to curb the menace of private universities who flouted norms by giving away PhD degrees. He said it was necessary to grant some specific procedure for admissions.
 
 The former member of the UGC said “there is nothing special, strange or obnoxious about this regulation but what is strange is the administration’s ploy for which the UGC is being blamed.”
 
 Speaking on the issue of ‘minority rights’,   sociology professor Tanweer Fazal, who was also a part of the government appointed Sachar Committee, described the concept of social justice in a university and talked about how there has been a struggle on the concept of reservation based on social position or on economic basis.
