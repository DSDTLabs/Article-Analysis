Surat: The police started taking action against vehicles parked in an unauthorized manner on road and footpath outside Surat District and Sessions Court campus here on Thursday.

 Traffic police swung into action after TOI raised the issue of traffic jam outside the court campus because of vehicles parked on footpath and road by people. The problem aggravated since the vehicles that were earlier parked inside the court campus began to be parked outside due to demolition of the old court building. The demolition work is over now and some vehicles could be again parked inside the campus, lawyers said. 
 
 Police have started applying wheel locks to four-wheelers and lift motorcycles parked on the road. However, they removed the locks from the four-wheelers and discontinued the lifting of vehicles in view of representation by lawyers. The lawyers asked the police to give them some time before strictly implementing the traffic rules in the area.
 
 “People who park their vehicles haphazardly outside the court campus have been informed. We will take strict action in case of violation of traffic rules and unauthorized parking. The action initiated on Thursday will continue to keep the road clear,” special commissioner of police, traffic and crime, S G Bhati.
