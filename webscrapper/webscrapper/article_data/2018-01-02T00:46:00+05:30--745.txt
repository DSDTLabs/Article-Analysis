Madurai: A 27-year-old software   based in Bengaluru committed suicide at his home at Jaihindpuram on Monday. R Mithun Raj was said to have been suffering from severe hair loss and was depressed.

 Police said R Mithun Raj had a skin problem, which resulted in hair fall. He had been taking various treatment, but nothing seems to have worked. 
 
 Mithun worked in Infosys in Chennai for a few years before shifting to another company in Bengaluru last year. 
 
 After his father died 10 years ago, his mother Vasanthi raised him and his elder brother Mathan Raj. His brother shifted after he got married. Since his mother was alone, Mithun used to come home often. 
 
 Police said Mithun’s mother had been looking for an alliance for him for quite some time. 
 
 He began getting worried when things did not fall in place. Although his mother and friends used to comfort him about his skin ailment and hair loss, he appeared to have lost faith in medication.
 
 His brother Mathan said Mithun was short tempered, but good natured. 
 
 “We are still shocked that he took the extreme due to this problem. He never talked about any other problem to family members or friends. His friends said he had spoken normally to them even hours before he committed suicide,” he said.
 
 Police said that Mithun’s mother had gone to a temple on Sunday evening. Mithun, who had gone out, returned when she was away, used his key to enter the house and hanged himself. 
 
 Vasanthi reached home and found her son hanging. With the help of neighbours, she rushed him to the Government Rajaji Hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. 
 
 Based on a complaint from Vasanthi, a case was registered with the Jaihindpuram police station and an inquiry was carried out.
