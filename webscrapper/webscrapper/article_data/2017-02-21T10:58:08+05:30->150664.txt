LUCKNOW:   (BSP) functionary Ram Awtar Mittal lodged a case against unidentified miscreants under IT Act for creating a fake twitter handle in the name of BSP supremo   and issuing a tweet urging people to vote for BJP instead of Samajwadi Party. 

 The case was lodged at Gautampalli police station under section 66/67 IT Act.
 
 Giving details, Gautampalli inspector Ashutosh Tripathi told TOI that Mittal had alleged that the tweet from BSP supremo’s fake twitter handle was aimed at denting the image of the former chief minister and her party. “Mittal submitted two photocopies of the alleged tweets to the police after which a case was registered in this connection,” he said. 
 
 “UP ke matdataon se mera anurodh hai ki sapa ko vote na dekar bhajapa ko vote dein, meri party toh chunav mein haar hi rahi hai,” says the tweet from the twitter handle: @mayawatibsp (It is my request to UP voters to vote for the BJP and not the SP, as my party is losing the elections).
 
 Tripathi said the police had started the investigation.
