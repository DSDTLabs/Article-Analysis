 “Though there were nearly 2.5 lakh vacancies unfilled in railways for the last several years, the central government continues to ignore the legitimate demands of railway men,” he added.
 
 “We have decided to conduct a 72 hour relay hunger strike from 6am on May 8 to 6am on May 11. In Southern Railway, thousands of SRMU railway men and women would conduct the hunger strike in front of the general manager’s office, divisional railway manager’s office, workshop manager’s office and at important junctions,” he added.
