Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar said the water sport policy is being drafted and it will be released in September. The new three-year policy will curtail existing malpractices linked to water sports activities in the state. “The department has drafted the water sports policy/ guidelines whereby the number of licences per person will be decided. It will be released in September,” Parrikar told the Goa assembly on Thursday while replying to a question tabled by Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao.  Parrikar holds the ports portfolio as well. Churchill had said that some operators manage to get more than one licence which is unfair to others. Parrikar said the water sports policy would take care of such problems once it becomes operational in two months. In the past, licences were issued without any guidelines and some applicants got many licences. Till date, a maximum 28 licenses were issued to a single person, Parrikar said. “It is proposed that one-third of licences be replaced at the end of the three-year period,” said Parrikar. The proposed provision, Parrikar said, has been added to ensure that fresh applicants are given a chance. Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco pointed out that accidents have happened involving water sports operators and sought to know what is being done to ensure that safety of users is not compromised.  Water sports activity is promoted by Goa Tourism in a big way. The beaches of North Goa as well as South Goa have thriving water sports during the tourism season. Parrikar said the policy is being drafted taking four important factors into consideration that include beach carrying capacity, fishing community, safety and environment of the beach where water sports are permitted.  Currently, the validity of water sports licences is limited to one year, and licensees are not permitted to operate during the four months of the monsoon.
