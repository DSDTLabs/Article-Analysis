 The   reaching the retail market are of different varieties and are available in the price range of Rs 80 to Rs 450 a kg. 
 
 Trader   said that the first lot of mangoes arrived last week. “We bring mangoes from the Vashi market in Mumbai. I started selling mangoes from last three days. But the demand is much low now. I have sold barely a few kgs of mangoes so far,” he added.
 
  “Last year too,   was expensive during this time of the year. The prices reduced from Rs 450 to Rs 200 a kg once there was a rise in supply. This year too, the prices may drop to Rs 200 a kg once the supply improves,” he Shaikh.
 
 Another trader Guddu Prasad said, “Generally, the mango season begins from the first week of April. We have mango varieties such as Lalbag and Keshar. The market will pick up from Gudhi Padwa. Most people start eating mangoes from this auspicious day.” 
 
 Last year, a mango festival was held in the city during which growers from Konkan had sold Alphonso of different varieties. Around 65 mango farmers from Konkan had sold mangoes worth Rs 80 lakh in just 17 days. The festival is to be held this year too next month. The objective will be to sell the farmers’ produce directly to consumers at marginal rates and pass on the price benefits to the consumers.
