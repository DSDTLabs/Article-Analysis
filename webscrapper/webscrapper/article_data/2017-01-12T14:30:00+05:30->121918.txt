THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   is all set to launch an ambitious programme aimed at establishing environment literacy in the state.

 The literacy mission has decided to embark on environment literacy programme as the state has already crossed the conventional literacy target and the central government fund for the same has almost become miniscule for Kerala.
 
 Education minister C Raveendra Nath has released the logo of the environment literacy programme here on Wednesday.
 
 "Environment literacy should be considered one of the major components of continuing literacy programmes. Impact of climate change is seen in every sphere of life," the minister said.
  
 Literacy mission director P S Sreekala received the logo from the minister. The minister also presented a cash award of Rs 5000 to Ernakulam native Jothu Cherayi who designed the logo.
  
 The environment literacy campaign aims to inculcate basic awareness among people on need for conservation of environment. Apart from awareness classes, the mission would also focus on promotion of environment friendly development programmes, setting up of environment friendly villages, promotion of organic farming.
 
 In connection with the programme launch, the mission has completed an environment literacy survey in all 14 districts across the state. The survey results would be released in January end.
