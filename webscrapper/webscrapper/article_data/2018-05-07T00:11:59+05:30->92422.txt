Jodhpur: Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission has issued notices to the public works department (PWD) asking why the damage caused to CT scan machine at MDM Hospital and some parts of the hospital, not be recovered personally from the its officials. The commission has also issued notices to health education department and medical and health department officials. Notices have also been issued to the superintendent of the MDM Hospital and the HoD of the radiology department asking them why the damages caused by their negligence be not recovered from them.

 Taking a serious note of the factual report on the breaking down of the CT scan machines worth Rs 3,72,50,000 installed at the MDM Hospital and an estimated expenditure of Rs 2,10,85,120 on its repair, the commission observed that not only the hard-earned money of the common man was wasted due to negligence of the PWD officials but event he patients suffered who remained deprived of the facility for about 2 years.
 
 According to the report, the CT scan machine had broken down on account of the negligent civil work by the PWD just above the room of the machine leading to water seepage in the machine room. In spite of the repeated reminders to the PWD officials, no step was taken to rectify the problem by the PWD officials and the machine and hospital building continued to suffer.
 
 Though the hospital administration report held the PWD officials responsible for the breaking down of the machine and damage caused to building, the commission observed that the hospital administration acted as a silent spectator and neither intervened to stop the work nor brought the matter to the notice of the officials of the medical and health department as well as the medical education department. The commission has listed the matter for hearing on July 4.
