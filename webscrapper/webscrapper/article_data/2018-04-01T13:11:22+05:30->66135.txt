VISAKHAPATNAM: The area surrounding the   circuit house, located in one of the high-end areas in the city — Daspalla Hills — is in a miserable state. While Visakhapatnam is still striving to come out on top as the cleanest city in India, there are still areas in the city that deter commuters and the area around the   is one such place. 

 The unsanitary condition is resultant of irresponsible disposal of waste in the open, the obvious, non-segregation of waste, stray dogs and ragpickers who rummage through the waste and further spread the garbage around the space and irregular cleaning of garbage. 
 
 B Pinky, who has been residing in one of the apartments near the circuit house, said, “When we moved here around a decade back, the area was both peaceful and clean. However, in the past few years, a number of problems have cropped up.”
 
 She further said that since it is a hilly area, the problem of open defecation persists. “The cattle owners use the space to bathe their cattle.”
 
 J Rajesh, who crosses this area on a regular basis, complained, the area around the circuit house attract drunkards who leave the area strew with alcohol bottles. “In many instances, I have seen people play cards and cause nuisance to commuters.”
 
 Speaking to TOI, the zonal commissioner, said, “The garbage is cleared on a regular basis. However, people throw their trash in the open, rendering our efforts to nought.”
 
 He further said “We have been trying to create awareness among people to change their behaviour and not defecate in the open as we want the city to be open defecation free. If denizens do not cooperate how can we keep the city clean?”
