MUMBAI: A third accused was arrested on Saturday in the case involving a 23-yearold woman commuter who was struck with a stick by a robber perched on a signal pole, causing her to fall off a running local. The incident had occurred between Sandhurst Road and Masjid stations on Wednesday. 

 Earlier, the   (GRP) had arrested a 17-year-old boy and a housewife. The commuter,  , lost her left little finger, parts of her middle and ring fingers and a part of the right foot after she was hit by another train. 
 
 “On quizzing the juvenile and motorman of the second train who had rescued Dravita, we learnt about the involvement of a third accused. He was tracked down from Sandhurst Road and has been identified as Raja Pal alias Ajay, 26,” said senior inspector Sanjay Shinde, CST GRP. 
 
 On the day of the incident, Pal stood at a distance while the juvenile struck Dravita. After she fell, the juvenile pocketed her phone and ran away with Pal. The duo later sold the phone, costing Rs 18,000, to a housewife from Masjid named Rukhsar Barguya for a mere Rs 4,000. 
 
 Both Barguya and Pal were remanded to judicial custody by a railway court. The juvenile has no previous crime record and has been sent to the Dongri observation home. Dravita underwent another procedure at the Bhatia Hospital on Saturday. 
 
 “No fever has developed which means her infection is under control. Her blood count and other parameters are under control. We have moved her from the ICCU into the ward and upgraded her status so that she gets better care,” said Dr Rajeev Boudhankar, CEO, Bhatia Hospital. The hospital has decided to waive off charges as a social commitment.
