PATNA: The BJP has offered support to Bihar’s   in the “interest of the state” if his JD (U) parts ways with ruling alliance partners RJD and Congress.

 “A final decision in this regard, however, will be taken by our central leadership,” BJP’s state president   told the media in Patna on Monday.
 
 Rai said the saffron party would only give outside support the to Nitish government. “We will not join the government and we will not destabilise it,” he said. 
 
 The JD (U) has 71 MLAs. With the support of BJP-led NDA’s 58 MLAs, including 53 of the BJP, the number would add up to 129 in the House of 243. Nitish will need the support of 122 MLAs to continue as CM.
 
 The BJP-led alliance, meanwhile, continued to mount pressure on Nitish to remove Lalu Prasad’s son   from the post of deputy CM following the CBI raids against the RJD chief and his family on Friday over corruption charges.
 
 However, Nitish has maintained silence on the matter for the last four days. “The CM should break his silence on the issue. He has till now maintained a zero- tolerance policy towards matters of corruption, and in the past took resignation of few ministers,” Rai said earlier in the day.
