BENGALURU: The high court on Friday dismissed a PIL filed by the Shankarapuram Residents' Welfare Association, seeking prohibition of   at the   in Basavanagudi. 

  The BBMP, which owns the playground, said it permits non-sporting activities only for five days a month, including a Sunday. The same is being strictly implemented and will be followed in future too, as per an order passed on June 5, 2015 by the then administrator, the agency said. 
 
  However, the petitioners claimed that whenever a non-sporting activity is held, residents had to endure a number of issues like "threat to life and property, restriction on personal and vehicular movement, haphazard parking of vehicles, etc". 
 
  The court said the playground is an open land and not a specially constructed or designated stadium or a sport complex. "The municipal authority's decision does not suffer from any irrationality or illegality," a division bench of Chief Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee and Justice P S Dinesh Kumar observed. 
 
  Comed K extends counselling 
 
  The ComedK (Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of  ) will conduct counselling for unfilled and surrendered engineering seats by this month-end. The move comes in the wake of a petition filed by the admission overseeing committee against ComedK for not calling for an extended second round of counselling to fill vacant engineering seats. The consortium sent a memo to the government-constituted overseeing panel headed by retired judge Anand Byrareddy, and submitted it before the high court. A division bench headed by Justice   disposed of the petition.
