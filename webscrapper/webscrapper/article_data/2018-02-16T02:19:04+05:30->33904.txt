NEW DELHI: The   of the capital   their   on Thursday.

 Anxious parents whose ward’s name did not figure in the draw of their preferred school already started looking at securing seats in   schools.
 
 Since morning, parents started calling up at the schools inquiring about the time the lists would be put out on websites. While some parents turned lucky with their ward’s name figuring in first lists of more than one school, others were advised to wait for the second list before making any “unsure” decision. Many children got selected in multiple schools and once they take admission in one school, other seats will fall vacant. 
 
 The schools have until February 20 to resolve parents’ queries. The second list is expected to come out by February 28.
 
 Few parents who were thinking of getting their ward drop a year were advised against it — on the forum of admissionsnursery.com — as the upper age limit will be implemented from next year.
