PUNE: The normally quiet officers’ mess at   reverberated with the sounds of laughter and loud cries of ‘Ganapati Bappa Morya’. 

 The reason: A workshop on making eco-friendly Ganesh idols. For retired airmen and their wives, it was their first attempt at idol-making.
 
 “We meet every three months to do something fun and engaging. The idol making workshop was something novel. Husbands and wives compared the idols that they had made and tried to figure out whose idol was better,” said Wing Commander (retired),  , who organised the workshop.
 
 The members of Retired Airforce Officers Club so loved the experience that some of them even borrowed clay to demonstrate their idol-making skills at home. Air Commodore (retired)   is one of them. Since Mehrotra’s wife could not be present at the workshop because of ill health, he took upon himself the task of sculpting Ganesh idols for his wife.
 
 “It was such a pleasant experience. I took a lot of pictures and sent them to my daughter abroad,” said the 67-year- old.
 
 “The enthusiasm among the retired officers, most of whom were in their seventies, was infectious,” said  , the sculptor who conducted the workshop.
 
 Altogether 80 people, including retired officers and their wives, attended the workshop.
 
 To promote the use of eco-friendly Ganesh idols, Dhondphale has formulated a method in which idols can be made using just clay. “Through my experience I have learnt that once people get to know that they can make these idols themselves, that too at such a low cost, they prefer making idols at home and rather than buying them from outside,” he added.
