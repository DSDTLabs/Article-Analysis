CUTTACK: A student of   in Nischintakoili block of Mahanga assembly seat attempted self-immolation on Monday to protest against health minister and local MLA  's visit to the college annual function. 

 Assistant general secretary of the college,  , a Plus III student, had earlier warned college authorities that he would set himself on fire if Jena was invited to the programme.
 
 Lenka is against politicians attending college events as he feels that this unnecessarily politicizes the programmes. He had even submitted a written memorandum on his position to the college. 
 
 The authorities however went ahead with their plan to invite Jena to the function as chief guest. The minister attended the event on Monday. Local police had deployed two platoons in and around the campus.
 
 The programme began at 3 pm. When Jena was delivering his speech, Lenka stood in front of the entrance and poured kerosene on himself. 
 
 Police personnel reacted swiftly and prevented him from lighting the matchstick. The boy was arrested. 
 
 Though police and college officials claimed that the function concluded smoothly, some locals said the minister had to step down mid-speech. 
 
 "The function was not affected in any way," said inspector in charge of Nischintakoili police station, P K Behera.
 
 The college authorities were not available for comment. Lenka could not be contacted either.
 
 Police have registered a case under Section 309 of the IPC against Lenka. He was released on bail.
