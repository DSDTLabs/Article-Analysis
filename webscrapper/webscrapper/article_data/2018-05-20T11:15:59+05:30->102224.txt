CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh district   on Saturday issued a notice to the defence counsel in an application moved by Chandigarh district court bakshi khana staff to handcuff the three accused in an auto gang rape. 

 The staff of the court lockup had sought court’s permission to handcuff the three accused stating that there was a fear that the accused —Mohammad Irfan, Garib and Kismat Ali— who were in custody for allegedly raping a Dehradun girl in November last year, might escape. The court issued the notice and sought defence’s reply. Earlier, Mohammad Irfan had tried to commit suicide in police custody and the civil court had then allowed cops to handcuff him for the time being.
 
 According to charge sheet, a 21-year-old woman had boarded a shared autorickshaw at 7.45pm on November 17 last year after attending her first stenography class in Sector 37. There were two male passengers —Garib and   alias Poppu— already in the three-wheeler. Instead of taking the woman to Mohali, where she stayed as a paying guest, the driver Mohammad Irfan headed towards Sector 42, on the pretext of refuelling the vehicle. Later, Mohammad Irfan drove her to a jungle opposite the fuel station where all the three committed the heinous act.
