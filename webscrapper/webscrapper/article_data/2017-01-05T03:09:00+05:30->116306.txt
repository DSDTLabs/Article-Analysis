Panaji: Bicholim’s independent MLA   resigned on Wednesday to contest the upcoming assembly elections on the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) ticket. Confirming his resignation as an MLA, Sawal said he will join MGP on Sunday.

 Sawal, who defeated BJP’s candidate in a triangular fight in the March 2012 assembly election, had joined hands with opposition members to raise issues against the BJP-MGP alliance government. During the last few months, Sawal was seen hobnobbing with MGP leaders as his relationship with BJP started developing cracks. It strained further as MGP asserted itself in Bicholim even as top leaders of both parties (BJP and MGP) maintained that the alliance would continue. tnn
