Tennis star Roger Federer’s video featuring  ,   and a videobombing   singing the the Chicago classic Hard To Say I am Sorry is the breaking the internet! With the musician   on the piano, Federer, Dimitrov and Haas take on the vocal duties for the emotional song. They hit the right notes and tug at the heart strings of fans while their theatrics are just adorable. The highlight of the one-and-a-half minute video is when the video cuts to Djokovic in a completely different setting with the text ‘videobomb’ flashing in the backdrop. We did detect a wee bit of auto-tune, but the emotional renditions of the sportstars make it forgivable. And with Federer announcing, “No seriously, we’re actually starting a boyband: The one handed  . We’re recruiting. (sic),” we can’t wait for more.
