PANAJI: The Union government granted permission to Additional Solicitor General of India, Atmaram   to appear in the   water diversion case before the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal on behalf of the state. Earlier, in the month of February, Union government had withdrawn the permission to allow Nadkarni to appear before the tribunal.
 
  The decision will help the state government to put up its case precisely in tribunal as Nadkarni is well-versed with the matter, a government source said.
  
  Responding to the central government’s order withdrawing permission to Nadkarni to represent Goa state in the Mhadei water diversion matter, the then chief minister, Laxmikant Parsekar had sought Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s intervention to allow Nadkarni to appear before the tribunal.
  
  The deputy legal adviser at department of legal affairs, R K Srivastava in a letter to the state government said, “…after reconsidering the matter, permission has been granted to Nadkarni for appearing before the tribunal on behalf of the state in relaxation of rules with the clear stipulation that his appearance will be as an advocate and no as ASG.”
  
  Parsekar in a letter to PM had said “it appears to be that on account of some political influence wielded by the state of Karnataka and its politicians, the steps have been taken by your (law) ministry without even calling for views of the state of Goa or without in any manner putting me to notice as it was at my request to the PM that the permission was granted’’.
  
  Karnataka has been trying hard for an out-of-court settlement in the Mhadei matter for more than a year now. In January this year, a lobby of Karnataka MPs had called on the PM and also the Union law minister to resolve the issue “amicably”. One of their demands was not to give permission to Nadkarni to appear on behalf of Goa before the tribunal and also in the  . Nadkarni, with his team, had put up a strong case against Karnataka before the tribunal.
