NEW DELHI: The Centre today strongly refuted as "erroneous" the reports that it has agreed to carve out a larger Nagaland state.

 A   spokesperson said some reports have appeared recently to the effect that the Government of India has agreed to carve out a larger Nagaland state by taking away territories of states contiguous to Nagaland.
 
 "Such reports are erroneous. It is clarified that there is no such agreement or decision by the Government of India," the spokesperson said.
 
 Thuingaleng  , General Secretary, NSCN-IM (Naga insurgent group) was quoted recently that the 'Framework Agreement' signed with the Centre two years back has recognised the outfit's demand for territorial integration of all Naga inhabited areas in the region.
 
 The Framework Agreement was signed on August 3, 2015 by Muivah and the government's interlocutor R N Ravi in presence of Prime Minister   and Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
 
 The agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years with the first breakthrough in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed.
 
 "The pact had set the political parameters of the final solution," officials said.
