MUMBAI: The state’s ruling party, BJP, could end up seeing its own state headquarters demolished soon.

 The BMC on Friday morning began demolishing large parts of   and other encroachments at the 72,000 sq ft   near Mantralaya around the party’s headquarters. This clearly indicated that the   too was in the line of fire. When TOI visited the spot on Friday evening, the demolition action of the Employment Exchange office was on in full swing.
 
 The matter dates back to 2013 when the Nariman Point-Churchgate Citizens’ Association (NPCCA) challenged encroachments near the garden by the BJP, Janata Dal and agencies such as the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, the Employment Exchange and the Zunkha Bhakar Kendra.
 
 In its March 2, 2016, order, while disposing of a PIL filed by the NPCCA, the Bombay high court gave the BJP six months to demolish the illegally constructed portion of its state headquarters at Nariman Point and reduce it to the original allotted area of 1,200 sq ft. 
 
 When contacted a senior civic official confirmed that the demolition of the offices was being done following the court orders. 
 
 “We have served the notices in the past as well. However, they have not demolished the offices. Therefore we needed to demolish the structures over the recreational ground,” said the official. NPCCA vice-president Atul Kumar said that this was an unprecedented victory for them in freeing up the large open space in the city. “We are glad that agencies have considered it important to move out. The BJP office had during the earlier demolition reduced the size of its office considerably. The onus is on the BMC to ensure that the structures are demolished and the open space remains free,” said Kumar.
