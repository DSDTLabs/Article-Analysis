FAIZABAD: BJP MP   has said that Muslims voted for BJP in Uttar Pradesh because the party “won their hearts with its welfare policies”.

 “We secured Muslim votes without any appeasement. Instead we gave them their due. The   government’s schemes were implemented in Uttar Pradesh without any discrimination between communities.
 
 This gesture won their hearts and we got their votes,” Katiyar told TOI. “From many Muslim pockets we got large number of votes, especially of Muslim women. And when Muslim women decided to vote for us then Muslim men too came on our side,” Katiyar said. He said, “Muslims need not to live under fear in the BJP rule in UP. We will protect their lives, their rights and their honour as our duty and not as appeasement.”
