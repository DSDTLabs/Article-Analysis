FAIZABAD: At a glace, fight for the   assembly seat of Ambedkarnagar district may seem like an unequal one where pitted against sitting   MLA Azim Ul Haq aka Pehelwaan and Irfan Pathaan, an AIMIM strongman, is   candidate  , a widowed housewife.

 However, BJP’s choice of candidate is a well thought out one in this Muslim-dominated constituency. The political battle here has turned into a fight for justice for Sanju as both her rivals’ names have come up in connection with two murders in her family.
 
 Sanju’s husband and nephew were both murdered in 2013. Her husband Ram Babu Gupta, a local businessman and VHP leader, was murdered on March 4, 2013, and VHP and BJP leaders had accused Pehelwaan of orchestrating the killing. Tanda and the adjoining areas were in the grip of communal violence for over a week following Gupta’s murder. While police didn’t file an FIR against Pehelwaan, Irfan Pathaan was booked as accused. However, Gupta’s family moved the local court, alleging that the local police were shielding Pehelwaan. 
 
 Ten months after Gupta’s murder, on December 4, his nephew Ram Mohan Gupta, also a VHP activist and a businessman, was killed the same way. This time round, local police booked both Pehelwaan and Pathaan. While Pehelwaan’s name was removed later, Pathaan, along with three others, was arrested and sent to jail. He is out on bail and a litigation against Pahelwaan filed by Gupta’s family is sub judice.
 
 Last week, in its second list, the BJP announced Sanju’s name. Talking to TOI, her relative Ved Prakash Gupta said, “Modi ji, who visited Ambedkarnagar during Lok Sabha elections, called Sanju Devi up on the stage and assured her of justice at all cost.”
