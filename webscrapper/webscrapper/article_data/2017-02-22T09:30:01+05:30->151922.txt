 is choosing her path carefully on big screen, post success of Nagarjuna Akkineni's 'Soggade Chinni Nayana' and 'Khsanam'. 

 The television host, who turned out to become a sensation lately has been roped in by the makers of Sai Dharam Tej's 'Winner', to shake a leg with the actor in a special song- 'Suya Suya', written after her name. Incidentally, another popular anchor, Suma, crooned for it. 
 
 While the song is already topping the charts and is raving reviews, we hear that the anchor- turned- artiste was yet to be settled her full and final payment by the producers of 'Winner'. It said learnt that Anasuya was signed for a pay check of Rs 20 lakh and the makers have only cleared Rs 12 lakh, as of now. Another Rs 8 lakh are yet to be cleared. Is that why the anchor is not seen in promotional activities of the film though it is just two days away from its release? 
 
 Winner is directed by Gopichand Malineni and Rakul Preet is the leading lady of the film, produced by Nallamalapu Bujji and Tagore Madhu jointly. The movie is hitting the screens on February 24.
