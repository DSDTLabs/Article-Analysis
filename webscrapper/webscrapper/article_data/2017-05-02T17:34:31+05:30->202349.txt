Justice   is certainly not a movie lover. In addition, he also openly declared recently that people who watch movies like   are idiots. The veteran said all this recently in a facebook post, which went thus:

 Mega opening for Bahubali
 Tickets all sold out
 The Roman Emperors used to say :
 " If you cannot give the people bread, give them circuses "
 Indian Establishment says : if you cannot give the Indian people bread, give them any of these opiums : 1. Religion 2. Films 3. Media 4. Cricket 5. Babas 6. Astrology
 Or better still to give all of them rolled into one
 Look at the smiling faces on T.V. screens of the idiots talking about the film
 Hari Om
 
 To someone who commented asking him about his movie watching habits, he replied: I have not seen a film for decades.
