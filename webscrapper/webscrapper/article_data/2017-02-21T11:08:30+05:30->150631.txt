GAYA: Whereas deputy CM   accompanied his party’s legislative council nominees Punit Kumar Singh and Dinesh Yadav to the returning officer’s office to file their nomination papers, Congress minister   Jha failed to turn up for his party candidates. Congress nominees Ajay Singh (graduates’ constituency) and   (teachers’ constituency) filed their papers in a low-key manner.

 Sources said Jha was scheduled to be in Gaya for the filing of papers by the Congress nominees. Other Congress ministers, including Awadhesh Kumar Singh and  , who is also the party’s state chief, were also not present on the occasion.
 
 The conspicuous absence of the ministers has not gone down well with the party workers. It seems the party leaders are “running with the hare and hunting with the hounds”, said a disappointed Congress activist. Congress leader Priye Ranjan Dimple attributed Jha’s absence to his being ‘indisposed’.
 
 Playing down the differences in the grand alliance on the issue of biennial elections to the legislative council in the forthcoming election for the Gaya graduates and Gaya teachers’ seats, Tejashwi said the council election fight would, in no way, affect the government’s stability. He said the parties and not alliances were contesting the council elections.
 
 Even the NDA constituents were fighting against each other, said Tejashwi. The RLSP and LJP, constituents of the NDA, have fielded their own candidates for the Gaya teachers’ seat. Whereas RLSP has fielded sitting MLC Sanjiv Shyam Singh for the Gaya teachers’ seat, LJP has fielded DN Sinha in the same constituency.
 
 Tejashwi said his father and RJD boss   had talks with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi. He would also be going to Amethi to campaign for the SP-Congress alliance candidates, Tejashwi said.
