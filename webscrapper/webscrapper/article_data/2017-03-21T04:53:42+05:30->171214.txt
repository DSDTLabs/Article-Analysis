GURUGRAM: A   celebration turned tragic after a guest was   during “celebratory firing” in Rajendra Park on Sunday. 

 Twenty-four-year-old Pankaj Kumar, a resident of Isapur in Delhi, had gone to Gurgaon to attend the wedding of his friend’s sister. According to the guests present at the venue, Pankaj collapsed while dancing to the music being played by the DJ after the groom’s arrival at the venue. On closer look they realised that Pankaj had been shot at. He was rushed to Metro Hospital in Palam Vihar where his condition is said to be serious. 
 
 Kumar’s father, who was immediately informed, reached the hospital with Pankaj’s brother Virender. There he was briefed about the incident by Sonu, a friend at whose invitation Pankaj went to participate in the wedding. 
 
 “I don’t know what happened there. Pankaj is undergoing a surgery now and doctors have told us that he is in a   state. The   hit his stomach and raptured his intestines. Doctors are trying to fix it,” said Pradeep Kumar, Pankaj’s father.
 
 “Since the bullet was shot from a straight distance, we are facing difficulties in identifying the culprit. Owing to the loud music, no one heard the gunshot. We have also gone through the camera footage which people have recorded, but could not zero in on the accused so far,” said sub inspector Devender Singh, who is investigating the case.
 
 Pradeep in his statement alleged that it was a murder attempt and not an accident. An FIR has been registered against an unknown person under section 307(attempt to murder) of the IPC and section 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act at Rajendra Park police station.
