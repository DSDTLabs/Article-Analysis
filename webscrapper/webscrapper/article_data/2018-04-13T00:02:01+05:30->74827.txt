Pune: The joint charity commissioner of the Pune region has ordered an ad-interim ex parte temporary injunction, restraining the Obesity Surgery Society of India’s ( ) from conducting a re-audit of its international conference held in Goa last year and from taking any decision to terminate the membership of a prominent woman bariatric surgeon — the organizing secretary of the event.

 The woman surgeon had moved a plea for various reliefs following a controversy over alleged financial irregularities in the conference of International Federation for Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO), Asia Pacific Chapter. On March 29, the woman surgeon lodged an FIR accusing six senior OSSI members of bid to extort Rs20 lakh from her.
 
 Her lawyer, Shivraj Kadam, said, “The OSSI’s executive committee will meet on April 13 evening for deciding on the re-audit and termination of the membership of our client. We argued IFSO APC was organized as an independent association of persons and had no link with OSSI. The later cannot commission a re-audit.”
 
 Shrihari Dhore-Patil, OSSI member, said, “We have not yet received any order.”
