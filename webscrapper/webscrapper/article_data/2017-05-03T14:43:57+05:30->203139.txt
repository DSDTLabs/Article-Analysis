 who was last seen in the 2015 hit ‘Dum Laga Ke Haisha’ is all set to be back on the big screen this year with not just one but two releases. Both ‘Toilet - Ek Prem Katha’, in which she pairs with   and ‘Shubh Mangal Saavdhan’, which has her reuniting with her ‘Dum Laga Ke Haisha’ co-star  , will hit the screens in August and the actress can’t wait to see the response to both.

 In an interview with a leading daily Bhumi spoke about how she never felt away from the silver screen. The actress said, ‘After ‘Dum Laga Ke Haisha’, I did need some time to knock off my weight and I was lucky to get that. After that in the last one year, I have been shooting back-to-back for ‘Toilet - Ek Prem Katha’and ‘Shubh Mangal Savdhan’. In fact, I have been away from home for the last seven months and returned to Mumbai only a few days ago after wrapping up ‘Shubh Mangal Savdhan’.
