Krishnagiri: Public Works Department (PWD) officials have inspected the Krishnagiri Reservoir Project (KRP) dam following reports on water leakage in two of its shutters and ruled out any chance of shutter breach. 

 The officials said all the shutters were in good condition. “The water leakage happened due to rubber beading damage in the third and seventh shutters,” said K Meiyalagan, executive engineer, upper Pennaiyar division, Dharmapuri.
 
 A few days ago, local residents had alerted the district administration about the water leakage in two shutters and urged collector C Kathiravan to look into the issue at the earliest to avoid shutter breach.
 
 The collector subsequently directed the PWD officials to inspect the dam to find out the cause behind the water leakage.
 
 On Wednesday evening, a team of engineers led by Meiyalagan inspected the dam and met the collector on Thursday to submit the report.
 
 “We found damage in the rubber beadings of the dam shutters. It will not lead to shutter breach at any time,” Meiyalagan said. 
 
 Pointing out that the inflow to the dam had gone up following the copious rain in its catchment areas, he said as a result the water level in the dam had suddenly rose by 2ft in as many days. “The water level has now crossed 40.30ft from the earlier 38ft. The rubber beadings damaged due to water pressure following the sudden rise in the water level,” Meiyalagan said.
