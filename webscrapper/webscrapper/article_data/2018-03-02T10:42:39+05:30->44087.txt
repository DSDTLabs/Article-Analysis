TRICHY: Cracking down on good vehicles carrying people and thus risking their lives,   city police registered 95 cases against the truck owners in the past two days.

 The north and south traffic investigation wings attached to city police carried out the drive at several places and booked the trucks carrying people on February 27 and 28. Police collected a total of Rs 9,500 from the owners as fine under Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Act. 
 
 Hitch-hiking or hiring the truck en masse has been the norm especially by those in rural areas for several years now. Though police claimed to have booked the truck owners for violations, the latter continue to flout the norms and risk the lives of the public in the city and the district. 
 
 In the last two days, police found the violations rampant on stretches in Mannarpuram, Zonal point, Edamalaipatti Pudhur, Court, East Boulevard Road, Oyamaari area, Sanjeevi Nagar and Gandhi Market area and booked the owners. 
 
 It may be noted that the region witnessed several fatal accidents in the last three years in Trichy, Thanjavur, Ariyalur districts where the victims were passengers. 
 
 In one instance, 15 people on a mini truck died after their vehicle collided with a cement-laden lorry in Ariyalur in September 2016, while in another 11 people died while travelling by a van near   in Trichy in August 2016. 
 
 In yet another accident, seven farmers on board a truck died near   hills in August 2017. In 2013, seven school students who hitch-hiked on a mini truck in Pudukkotai lost their lives. 
 
 Even though police conducted such drives, violations continued due to inconsistent efforts by the police.
