MEERUT: As many as two people, including a five-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, died while another person was critical after a container truck toppled on them in Hapur on Sunday. The truck was full of wood.

  Mahaveer Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Hapur (rural), said: “The incident took place at 9am on Sunday when the truck, full of waste wood, was passing from Garh Road. Since a flyover is being constructed on that route, the truck toppled after hitting some stone and construction material and collapsed on a boy who was on his cycle and a mother-daughter duo.”
 
  While Manvi (5) and a 15-year-old boy -- who is yet to be identified-- died on the spot, Manvi’s mother Seema (23) got injured and is struggling for her life in a local hospital.
 
  “An FIR has been filed in this matter against the driver, who is at large. Meanwhile, the truck has been seized by the police and efforts are being made to arrest him,” said Singh.
