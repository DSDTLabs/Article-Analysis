Navi Mumbai: A   working with an English daily and his friend were assaulted by five masked men in Kharghar on Friday afternoon. 

 The police said the incident took place around 12.30pm when the journalist,   (37), who is a resident of Panvel, and his friend, Santosh Phatate (38), parked their car near   in Kharghar. Senior inspector Dilip Kale said, “When they returned, they found that the car’s tyres had been deflated. Soon, five men, armed with hockey sticks, came on bikes and broke the car’s windscreen. When the duo tried to stop them, they were assaulted. The accused’s target was Suryavanshi; his friend has sustained minor injuries.”
 
 Kale said “While Suryavanshi has fractured his left hand, his friend has been discharged after treatment.”
 
 The police said that a dispute between members of Kalpataru housing society where Suryavanshi resides could be behind the assault. “Suryavanshi has claimed that he suspects the role of two members. He said that in the recent past, there had been spats with some members as he, being the chairman of the society, had raised issues related to illegal construction in some flats.”
