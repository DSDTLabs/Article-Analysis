MUMBAI: The country's   (CAD) -the shortfall caused by the gap between imports and exports -has widened sharply to 2.4% of gross domestic product ( ) during the quarter ended June 2017. This is the widest gap since June 2013 when the rupee had come under severe pressure. The balance of payments for the April-June quarter stood at $11.4 billion as against $6.7 billion in the year-ago period on the back of foreign inflows.

 According to data released by the RBI, the CAD was $14.3 billion, which amounts to 2.4% of the country's GDP. The surge in imports has resulted in the first-quarter CAD being almost as much as the $15 billion for the whole of FY17.
 
 CARE Ratings chief economist   said, “Going ahead, Q2 will be challenging as the trade deficit has been widening till August. With crude prices up, pressure will continue to mount on import bill.“ He added that remittance receipts need to go up, but these are contingent on the state of the world economy and US policy on immigration and outsourcing.
 
 According to ratings agency  's principal economist Aditi Nayar, the sharp surge in the CAD in Q1FY18 relative to Q1FY17 comes as no surprise. This was expected because of a spike in gold imports prior to the introduction of the GST, which is responsible for half of this uptick. “Moreover, the lagged impact of the rupee appreciation was partly responsible for a faster rise in non-oil, non-gold imports relative to exports, bloating the size of the merchandise trade deficit,“ said Nayar.
 
 The deficit would have been worse had it not been for a healthy 15% increase in the services trade surplus, and a modest increase in secondary income inflows. ICRA expects the FY18 deficit to double to $30-32 billion (1.2-1.3% of GDP). Nevertheless, this should be adequately financed through a resumption in NRI deposits, as well as healthy FDI and FII inflows.
