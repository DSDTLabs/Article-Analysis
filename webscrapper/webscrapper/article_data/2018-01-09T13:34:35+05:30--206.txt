MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the   was on Monday told that police were not acting against encroachers in Palani hills as they were allegedly receiving bribes from them.

 One Radhakrishnan filed a case seeking removal of encroachments in Palani hills, one of the six abodes of Lord   situated in   district. The case came up for hearing before the division bench headed by justice N Kirubakaran.
 
 The petitioner said, “To remove encroachments the district administration is taking steps. But, the local police are not interested in it. The people who are unauthorisedly doing business on girivalam path of the hills, give anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 3000 as bribe to police who pocket the money and do not take any action against them.” 
 
 To this, the bench said, “The petitioner’s statement that police are receiving bribe, is a shame on police. Does the salary, the government is giving to the police, not adequate?” It then directed the Dindigul police to file a report on action taken for removal of encroachments and against encroachers. It also directed to install   cameras on girivalam path to ensure removal of encroachments. Besides, it directed the district administration officials to produce details as to land leased on the   and action taken on unauthorised structures on the hills. To remove encroachments in water bodies near the hills, the court impleaded suo motu the principal secretary and superintendent engineer in the case and adjourned it to January 24.
