'Dangal' girl   who played the younger   in the   blockbuster, has posted an open letter on her Facebook page, which she later deleted. The 16-year-old, who hails from Srinagar, posted a note on her social networking handles to post an apology, asking Kashmiri youth not to follow in her footsteps or even consider her as their role model. 

 
 
 Zaira, who shot to fame post the success of 'Dangal', recently met the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehboob Mufti. During the meet, the starlet spoke her mind on the importance of educating the girl child and women's safety apart from other things. It is believed that she was then trolled online for meeting the CM. According to reports, a few comments didn't go down too well with Zahira which prompted her to post the apology. 
 
 In her letter, Zahira asks for an apology saying, 'I know that many people have been offended and displeased by my recent actions or by the people I have recently met. I want to apologise to all those people who I've unintentionally hurt and I want them to know that I understand their sentiments'
 
 
 
 She went on to say, 'I am being projected as a role model for Kashmiri youth. I want to make it very clear that I do not want anyone to follow in my footsteps or even consider me as a role model. I'm not proud of what I am doing but I want everyone, especially the Youth to know that there are real role models out there...'
 
 Zaira also goes on to write, 'To even consider me as a role model would be disgracing them and their disgrace would be OUR DISGRACE!'

 After deleting this post, Zaira shared another post where she insisted that she was not forced into anything by anyone and that the letter was to make sure that people were not hurt what she was doing.
