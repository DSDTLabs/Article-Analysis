NEW DELHI: Water minister   raised concern over the recent violence at   in the Delhi assembly on Monday. He also took on RSS for allegedly questioning the patriotism of a martyr’s daughter. The minister was making a reference to   student   who had been trolled in the social media for opposing ABVP.

 Mishra also raked up Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent “shamshan and kabristan” remarks. He took a dig at the PM saying that AAP government’s model of development was focused on education and health to ensure that people do not have to be taken for cremation.
 
 In his reply to the motion of thanks on the LG’s speech, Mishra said, “I do not know what the future has in store but I think the city has breathed a sigh of relief in light of the recent developments.” He cited how pending proposals on mohalla clinics and minimum wages were cleared by the LG recently. Referring to Modi’s remarks made during a poll rally in Uttar Pradesh, Mishra said while the   government’s focus was on fundamental necessities like education, health and water, the BJP government had its eyes on “shamshan and kabristan”.
 
 “We have seen a new trend during the Ramjas incident. I think it is for the first time that we have people in power who are experts in certifying their own countrymen on who is a patriot and who is an anti-national,” Mishra said. He went on to say that people who are questioning the patriotism of a martyr’s daughter should stop going where they go “in the morning”. His attack was aimed at RSS, which holds “shakhas” in the morning.
