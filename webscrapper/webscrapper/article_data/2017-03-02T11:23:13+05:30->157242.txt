SAHARSA: The teaching and non-teaching employees of 240 degree and 515   in Bihar will stage dharna before the   on March 20 in support of their demand for salary which they have not been paid for more than 20 years. 

 If the government fails to meet their demand, they may prolong the protest and turn it into an indefinite strike, said   member Dilip Kumar Mishra. “We are compelled to take such stand as most of us are facing starvation,” said Mishra.
 
 In preparation of the mega protest in Patna, the they staged an impressive dharna in the supermarket here on Tuesday and exhorted their fellow teachers to stand firmly against the government’s apathetic attitude. 
 
 In a strong-worded open letter addressed to the chief minister, the morcha has also narrated the deplorable condition of thousands of teaching and non-teaching employees working in these colleges. 
 
 The letter read: “During lifelong service, we were paid nothing as remuneration. On one hand, we are facing starvation and on the other many would retire from service without getting salary and confirmation.”
 
 Mishra revealed that after prolonged agitation, the state government in 2008 decided to grant aid to these colleges but that too had been paid to the teachers and employees only for four years from 2008 to 2011. “The amount released for the year 2011 has been retained by the universities concerned for no reason,” said Mishra. 
 
 “The state cabinet allocated grants to these colleges for two more years (2012 and 2013) but the requisite amount is yet to reach these colleges,” he added.
 
 Vijendra Narayan Yadav, president of BN Mandal University unit of the morcha, KP Yadav, president of Saharsa district unit of the morcha also addressed the agitating members.
