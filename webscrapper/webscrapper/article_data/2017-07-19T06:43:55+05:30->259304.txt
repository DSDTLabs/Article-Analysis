COIMBATORE: Three men barged into the house of a handicapped man at   in Sulur on Tuesday, threatened him at knifepoint and made away with gold jewels worth nearly 1 lakh. 

 Retired superintendent of the handicapped department   is a resident of Srinivasa Nagar. His wife is a government school teacher in Palladam. On Tuesday, around 2.15 pm, three knife-wielding people in the 25-30 age group barged into his home, gagged him with adhesive tape and tied his hands. They opened the steel bureau and took away the gold jewels and escaped.
 
 Sulur police said Gunasekaran was alone when the incident took place. “The men first knocked on the door and kept calling the name of Kandasamy. Gunaseakarn shouted that there was no person by that name there. But when they continued to knock, he opened the door. The trio barged in, committed the robbery and left through the front door of the house,” said the police officials. 
 
 Police said there was no CCTV camera in the area and finger print experts could not find any finger prints as the culprits had used gloves. Superintendent of police   said they suspected the involvement of local people in the crime. “We have caught one person whom we suspect is a friend of one of the robbers. We are interrogating with him and we will soon catch the culprits. The robbers must have known that Gunasekaran was disabled and planned the robbery when he was alone at home,” said Murthy. 
 
 A case was registered by the Sulur police officials. Investigations are on.
