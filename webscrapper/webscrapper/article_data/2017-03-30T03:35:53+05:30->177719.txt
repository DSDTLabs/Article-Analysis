KOLKATA:   has complained to the   after being threatened online with gang rape. Sen, who had earlier returned her Golden Jubilee Young Writers Award ( ) from   to protest against MM Kalburgi’s murder and the Dadri lynching, has also asked for police protection.

 On Wednesday, Sen met her lawyer at Calcutta high court to lodge her  , which was then delivered to Lalbazar. “It all started after I organized a rally from College Street to Y Channel on March 25 to protest against the attack on freedom of speech in our country and the communal atrocities. I came home and posted about the rally,” she said. A while later, she was bombarded with comments. “They used the filthiest of language. I can’t even write about them and don’t know the meanings of some of the words used,” she said.
 
 But she could understand the aggression in the attacks. On Wednesday, around noon, when she logged on to her Facebook account again, she was flooded with more comments. 
 
 “This is not just a personal attack on me. It is an attack on our society. I shudder to think what future we have ahead of us.”
 
 Vishal Garg, joint CP (crime) said that a case has been registered and is beng investigated by the cyber police station based on her complaint.
 
 Sen attached screenshots of the comments with her complaint, but she didn’t want to reveal the identity of her abuser and give him “undue publicity”. However, on Facebook, she posted the name of her abuser with his threat. “I have also requested cops to provide me with a bodyguard,” she said.
 
 Srijato, who has had an FIR filed against him for his 12-line controversial poem ‘Abhisaap’ and was also threatened online, has condemned the way Sen has been threatened. “I stand by Mandakranta and am condemning the attacks on her. I hope the administration will take all the necessary steps.”
