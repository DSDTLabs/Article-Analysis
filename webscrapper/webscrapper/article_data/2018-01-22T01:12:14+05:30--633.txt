GHAZIABAD: Two  , who had forged registration papers of a land in   worth Rs 50 lakh, were arrested on Sunday. The land belonged to a lawyer practicing at the district court in Ghaziabad. 

 The accused are Rajendra Yadav and Nain Singh.
 
 The complainant, Neeraj Kumar Sharma (38), a resident of Dundahera, said he had been running from pillar to post for the past two years to get justice in the case.
 
 “There is a group of five-six land grabbers who specialises in forging land documents and selling them in smaller plots. I have a plot measuring 2,700 square feet in Himanshu Colony in Sudamapuri. After Yadav had grabbed my land by building a boundary wall around it, I had lodged a complaint with the tehsil office some two years back. An inquiry was done and it was found that the land belonged to me. Later an FIR was lodged in January 2017,” Sharma said.
 
 “It was only after I meet SSP HN Singh two months back that police swung into action and arrested the two culprits,” Sharma added.
