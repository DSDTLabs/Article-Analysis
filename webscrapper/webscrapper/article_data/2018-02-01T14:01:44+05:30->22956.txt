PANAJI: After being on display in Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, Dubai, Singapore, and New Delhi and Ahmedabad in India, the travelling exhibition ‘The Nobel   - Ideas Changing the World’ will be on display in Goa this month. Anna Busch, who has been the curator of the   Museum in Sweden since 2001 and is presently the project manager of the travelling exhibition, said that what struck her when the exhibits came to India was the sheer number of people that walk in to view it, a number witnessed at none of the other venues it was on display.

 Busch said that exhibition largely looks to draw in youngsters with the inspiring stories of the Nobel Laureates and said that with the number of school children that attend such exhibitions it encourages her to consider take the travelling exhibition to more locations in the country.
 
 Busch is in Goa with the travelling exhibition as part of the only second Nobel Prize Series 2018 to be held in India, after the one hosted by Gujarat.
 
 In the age of internet, Busch said that though the exhibition reaches out to students, she wishes that Nobel Laureate scientists made their presence felt more on social media to capture the attention of the youth further.
 
 “We reach out to students who are still young and look up to Nobel laureates. They are celebrities. But I wish they were more online, had Twitter handles. It would be fun,” said Busch.
 
 Speaking about the discussions that often take place around Nobel Peace Prize winners and if they truly qualify for the prize, Busch said that though she is only a producer who presents Nobel prize laureates for the contribution they have been awarded, she said that she is in favour of the discussions that are generated especially around the Nobel Peace Prize awardees. “As a producer I do not take sides. But I like that there are discussions around the prizes,” said Busch.
