AHMEDABAD: A 30-year-old woman was assaulted by her husband with a sharp weapon after a fight between the two on Friday evening. The man then tried to commit suicide by consuming insecticide. They are being treated at   and VS Hospital. Chandkheda police have registered a case of attempt to murder.

 Chandkheda police said Preeti Shrimali, 30, a resident of Gujarat Housing Board, Chandkheda, married Kalol resident Yogesh Parmar seven years ago. Soon after tying the knot, Preeti’s brother severed relations with her. Preeti had lost her parents at an early age. Thus, she used to consider the Tabhani family, their erstwhile neighbours, as her family.
 
 “According to a complaint by Chatur Tabhani, a resident of Ambikanagar, Preeti came to his residence four days ago after an altercation with Yogesh. They convinced her to stay with them. Tabhani and his wife were out on Friday evening to prepare for their son’s wedding. Preeti and the Tabhanis’ youngest son, Jatin, 14, were home,” said an investigator.
 
 At about 6.30pm, Yogesh came to the Tabhani residence and sought to reconcile with Preeti. After a heated exchange, Yogesh stabbed Preeti in stomach. She started bleeding profusely and collapsed on the floor. As Jatin raised the alarm, Yogesh got hold of an insecticide and consumed the contents of the bottle.
 
 “Both are unconscious at the moment. We have lodged a complaint against Yogesh on the basis of Tabhani’s complaint,” said a Chandkheda police official.
