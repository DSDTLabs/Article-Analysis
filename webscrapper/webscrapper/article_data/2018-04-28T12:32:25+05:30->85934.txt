SURAT: A labourer was given life imprisonment by a sessions court on Friday for trying to rape a five-month-old girl five years ago in   area of the city. Additional sessions judge H P Mehta said he has given maximum punishment to the accused under the present law on finding him guilty because those involved in such heinous crimes don’t deserve any mercy. 

 Number of labourers had been hired to lay a pipeline of the   (SMC) in   area of Nana Varachha in 2013. One of the labourers at the site Mukesh Lalji Patel took the five-month-old daughter of another labourer with him on April 6, 2013, on the pretext of getting her a pack of biscuits. He took her behind a cement pipeline and tried raping the infant. 
 
 However, the baby’s mother had seen him taking her child behind the pipeline and hence followed the accused. She caught the accused, but the infant was bleeding by then. The infant’s father filed a complaint of rape against   and he was arrested. 
 
 Government pleader Dipesh Dave told TOI, “Doctors in their report had said they had found cuts and lacerations in the girl’s private parts.”
