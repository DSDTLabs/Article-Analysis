GURUGRAM: There are just two   cleaning   to keep the lines clear across the city that has a population of over 20 lakh people.

 Sources within the   said that the proposal for the purchase of sewage machines has been pending in Chandigarh for almost two years even as the city struggles with overflowing sewers. One such incident was recently reported from Sector 12a where the sewage was overflowing for a week. 
 
 According to few councillors, they have even proposed to the government to rent machines if their purchase is not getting the approval, but that too hasn’t seen any development. 
 
 “Around five months back, during a meeting with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, we proposed getting machines on rent as their purchase was taking time. However even that has not happened yet,” said Subhash Singhla, ward 8 councillor.
 
 “When MCG has the resources to rent machines, why are we sending men to clean the sewers and putting their lives at risk?” questioned Singhla. 
 
 When contacted, an MCG official, requesting anonymity, said, “Gurugram desperately needs more sewage   machines, especially in the old city areas . We need at least eight machines so that every zone has two machines each.” 
 
 Meanwhile, MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav has asked the engineering team to conduct a survey of all the sewage lines in the city and complete the cleaning process within two months.
