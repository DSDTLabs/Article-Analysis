PANAJI: The rising occurrence of violence against women in the country was due to indecent representation of them by   and regional movies, Union minister for women and child development   said here on Friday.

 “There is a very important reason why men believe they can get away or indulge in violence against women and that is films. In feature films, romance almost always starts with eve-teasing. The man and his friends will surround a woman, trip her up, show her down, abuse her, touch her inappropriately and slowly she falls in love with him,” Gandhi said, while suggesting this encouraged men to resort to such methods to woo women.
 
 Speaking at   2017, the advertising, media and marketing convention, she urged the film and advertising fraternity to make efforts to portray women in better light.
 
 Gandhi said for over 50 years and even now, movies played an important role in communicating social messages and the way Bollywood depicted romantic relations often spread the message that violence and sexual harassment impressed girls.
 
 “Films teach you to eve-tease a girl till she succumbs and then we are taught that men are stronger and women are weaker, and therefore, a woman who doesn’t listen must be tamed. Always the medium starts with violence. Right from 1950, in every regional or Hindi films, it is the same. Maybe we can look at that and think, should we be using this medium to propagate violence?” the Union minister said.
 
 Over the past two years, the ministry has identified cases where the age of the perpetrator and the victim has been decreasing with more instances of underage boys committing violence against women, including rape.
 
 “One of the reasons why violence against women continues is because men of a certain type believe that they are powerless. You have 17,000 people enter into unemployment every month, they are ill-educated and they have nothing to look forward to, therefore, they look for someone who is weaker than them,” she said.
