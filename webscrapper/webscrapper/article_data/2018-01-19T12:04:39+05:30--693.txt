PANAJI: The   on Thursday said it will propose to Union minister of mines   that all mining leases in the state should be in the name of the Goa government so that only contracts for extraction of minerals will need to be tendered or auctioned. A total of 160 iron ore mining leases in the state expire in 2020.

 Singh will preside over a meeting of state ministers for mines in   on Friday.
 
 Goa   director  , told reporters at a press conference that the Goa government should not auction the mining leases on their expiry in 2020.   will place its demands before the Union minister for mines,   said.
 
 With respect to the progress made on the district mineral foundation, Alvares said they will draw the Union minister’s attention to the fact that not a single rupee has been spent on welfare of mining-affected villagers. “On the contrary, the government of Goa is proceeding with proposals for mining infrastructure, which are unacceptable,” Alvares said.
 
 The miners are from private sector and hence no funds from the district mineral foundation should be made available for such commercially oriented operations, he said. “We will challenge any such proposal,” Alvares added.
 
 The mining surveillance system ( ) installed by the central government Alvares said indicates that “Goa’s mining industry is incorrigible and will continue to brazenly violate the law simply because it continues to be in charge of the Goa government, and therefore can continue to operate without any reasonable or credible controls”.
 
 The mineral scenario in India, preparedness for e-auction and amendment in mineral auction rule, preparedness for auction of mining leases expiring in the year 2020, mining surveillance system and star rating of mines, will be discussed at the meeting of mines ministers.
