 While addressing the officers, the CM said, “Our state is doing well on all fronts. Our aim is to create a positive impression about our state at the global level and get as much foreign investment as possible.” He informed them about the decision of four more countries, Japan, Tunisia, Mongolia and   to take part during the summit. 
 
 Das said, “We expect more than 2,500 delegates from India and abroad. More than 40 industrialists from across the globe will be here to partner with us in terms of investment.” He added, “There is some skepticism about industrial projects and foreign investment.

 Verma said the state has received investment offers worth Rs 3.2 lakh crore from various industrial and business houses. She added, “These are potential investment proposals, many of which will be finalized during the forthcoming summit.” TNN
