 “The tiger is around 24-years-old now and illnesses due to old age are quite common. The animal was being treated at the zoo hospital but was shifted back to its enclosure when it got better,” said a zoo official.
 
 Officials said that the python died due to old age, while the blackbuck was a stillborn that may have been due to inbreeding. The nilgai is said to have died due to injuries it sustained while fighting.
 
 “We keep exchanging animals so that inbreeding between the species is reduced. Chances of stillborns increase if inbreeding takes place,” said an official. Authorities also said the gaur became ill soon after becoming pregnant and despite treatment, it did not recover.
 
 The zoo had recorded 325 animal deaths in 2016-17. “Sanitation and general cleanliness has improved over the last year, extra precautions are being taken and the death count is very low this year,” said an official.
