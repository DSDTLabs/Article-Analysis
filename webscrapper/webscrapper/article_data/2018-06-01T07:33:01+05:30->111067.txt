LUCKNOW: The two-day strike by employees of nationalised banks to protest a meagre 2% salary hike offered by the management body,  , left the citizens reeling. 

 
 The strike called by bank employees demanding higher wage revision ended on Thursday but its impact was felt most since it was month-end when most salaried people get their monthly wages.
 
 People faced disappointment when they got messages of their salaries getting credited into their bank accounts but were unable to withdraw money as ATMs were dry by Thursday afternoon because of bank closure for two days.
 
 The strike by over 10,000 bank employees also stalled clearance of cheques worth over Rs 2,000 crore in Lucknow. The total worth of cheques stuck at state level was much higher at around Rs 25,000 crore. 
 
 There are around 734 branches and 1,073 ATMs of public sector banks in Lucknow. Senior bank officials said that around 40% ATMs were dry by Thursday because of increased cash withdrawals, May 31 being salary day. 
 
 Rajesh Dixit, a private sector employee, said, "I checked seven ATMs in   but had to return empty-handed. I wanted to withdraw salary to clear some urgent pending bills and ultimately had to borrow from a friend."
 
 ATMs of private banks too witnessed faster emptying of cash with increased rush of customers of nationalised banks. Sandhya Verma, a hosteller, said, "I am a student living away from home. I called my parents to send someone to give me cash as most ATMs in my locality didn't have any."
 
 People said that banks should have made adequate arrangements before strike at month-end. 
 
 Dhruv Jaiswal of Indiranagar said, "I went to Bhootnath to withdraw money but the guard deployed there said that the ATM was closed since May 30. If employees were on strike, banks should have at least ensured timely cash replenishment at ATMs so that people don't face problems."
