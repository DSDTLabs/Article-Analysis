HYDERABAD: The   appears to have consigned the   to the ‘archives’ if the budgetary allocation for 2017-18 is any indication. The Telangana government has allocated only Rs 68 lakh for the upkeep of this institute that maintains records as old as 600 years.

 The   possesses nearly 50 million rare records and documents and the meagre budgetary allocation will affect their conservation. The institute had sought funds for   of records, but they might not be able to put its plans to action now. The   is only sufficient to take up repairs to the old building and pay salaries to the temporary staff. The institute, which owes Rs 25 lakh towards property tax dues, had sought Rs 75 lakh for the upkeep of records.
 
 The institute has been receiving a raw deal in the budgetary allocations for several years. It did not get a single paise in the 2014-15 budget, the first after the formation of separate Telangana. The highest allocation it received was Rs 2 crore during the tenure of former chief minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy. 
 
 “It is unfortunate that the government has allotted peanuts to the state archives. It is one of the oldest archives in the country,” said a city-based historian.
 
 The archives contains rare records pertaining to Bahmani, Adil Shahi and Qutub Shahi dynasties, the Deccan province under the reigns of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, Asaf Jahi dynasty, and private collections consisting of Persian records dating back to 1406 CE. It played a key role in providing necessary information and records pertaining to the Andhra Pradesh Bhavan in Delhi that originally belonged to the Nizam. Officials also provided key documents and maps regarding the closure of AOC roads by the local military authority, stating that these roads were civilian roads as the land belonged to the Nizam.
