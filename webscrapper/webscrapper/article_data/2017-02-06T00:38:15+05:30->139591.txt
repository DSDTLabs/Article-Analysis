NEW DELHI: Despite a cloudy sky and a light drizzle across parts of the city on Sunday, Delhi remained rather warm. The minimum temperature rose six degrees above normal to touch 15.5 degrees Celsius. While no further rain is predicted in the immediate future, minimum temperatures across parts of northwest India are expected to fall by 3-5 degrees from Tuesday.

 “An active western disturbance, which was also responsible for the cloud cover and light rain over Delhi NCR and neighbouring areas, is likely to weaken and only scattered rainfall or snowfall will occur over the hills for another day,” said a Met official.
 
 The department said that shallow to moderate fog is very likely at isolated places over west UP and moderate to dense fog over east UP during the next 24 hours. Dense fog is very likely to occur at isolated places over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
 For Monday, the department has predicted a partly cloudy sky. Shallow to moderate fog is likely to occur in the morning while the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to be around 22 degrees Celsius and 14 degrees Celsius.
