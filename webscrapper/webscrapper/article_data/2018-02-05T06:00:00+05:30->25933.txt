It was a   party to remember for   who turned a year older in style on  , as he and his friends partied at his residence. The dinner party that was attended by 350-odd people, featured lip-smacking vegetarian dishes and classic cocktails that were a rage. While the live orchestra kept things lively with some   tunes, the birthday boy took the mike himself and rendered a few hit numbers, much to the delight of the guests. Dressed to the hilt, the guests got into an impromptu jig, while some posed for the shutterbugs. It was a fun time indeed!
