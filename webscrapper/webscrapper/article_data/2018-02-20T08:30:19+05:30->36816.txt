 The single bench of Justice V S Siradhana issued the order on a petition by Rajver Singh and others. Tanveer Ahmad, counsel for the petitioner said the petitioners had appeared for departmental selections of inspectors from sub-inspector for the vacancies in year 1997-98.
 
 According to the qualifying examination, 30 marks were determined for the rewards and punishment and it was prescribed that the marks of punishment shall be reduced from the marks of rewards. Accordingly promotions were made in the year 1997-98 in pursuant to which after selection and petitioners undertook the promotion cadre course and came to be posted as Inspector.
