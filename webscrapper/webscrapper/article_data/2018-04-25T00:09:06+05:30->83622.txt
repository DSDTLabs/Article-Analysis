Thiruvananthapuram: The   (KWA) is planning to wind up pipe-laying works in Ambalamukku-Muttada-Paruthipara -Kesavadasapuram stretch within a month. However, the slow pace of works by the contractor is troubling the  . 

 The KWA began replacing old and worn out premo and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes with ductile iron pipes in the stretch from November last year. Ever since, the people has been suffering due to lack of transportation, dilapidated road and dust. 
 
 On Tuesday, KWA sent a letter to the   informing that they are handing over the stretch from   to Vayalikkada. “The interconnection works are progressing and we are planning to hand over the entire stretch within a month. We understand the trouble caused to the local people, who are unable to use transportation for the past several months. We would resolve all issues before school re-opening,” said a KWA official. 
 
 The KWA had earlier requested police to give permission to close the Vayalikkada-Muttada stretch for pipe-laying. However, it did not receive permission. KWA officials said that they have taken up the work in the area without closing the road. 
 
 Based on petition filed by residents, the state human rights commission in January had issued a directive for speedy completion of work. The work in the stretch, being undertaken by Lotus Engineering, is also being strictly monitored by Lokayukta.
 
 Sources said that contractor is slow-pedalling the work citing non-availability of labourers and machinery. “We have taken all measures to speed-up the work,” KWA officials said.
 
 The KWA is also in the process of completing the pipe-laying works in Peroorkada-Sasthamangalam stretch. KWA officials said except a portion in Peroorkada, all other works on the stretch are in final phase.
