BENGALURU: Bengaluru, which comprises 28 assembly segments, has seen a massive jump in   in the past decade. While the state’s voter population grew by an average 9%, Bengaluru registered 24% increase since 2013.

 Bengaluru accounts for around 18% of the state’s total voter population as per data released by the Election Commission. The number of voters rose by 21 lakh from 67.3 lakh in 2008 to 87.9 lakh in 2018. Of this, 17.5 lakh were added during the past five years (2013-2018) alone.
 
 Constituencies like Mahadevapura and Yeshwantpur saw 71% rise while Bengaluru South, Dasarahalli, Byatarayanapura, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Yelahanka and Bommanahalli registered 50% increase since 2008. These segments fall in the city suburbs and comprise wards that are part of the BBMP.
 
 This rise is the reflection of the kind of growth these areas have been witnessing over the last decade, experts said. They attributed this to large-scale migration to the city from across the country for livelihoods, availability of land for development and influx of industries in these areas.
 
 Nearly 1.5 lakh voters were added since 2008 in Dasarahalli which has a large number of working-class population. There are garment factories and other industries in the area. Mahadevapura, where many techies from North India are settled, saw 2lakh new voters added since 2008.
 
 “I don’t see any foul play in the increase in voter population.
 
 It is in line with the city’s growth,” said BJP MLA Suresh Kumar.
