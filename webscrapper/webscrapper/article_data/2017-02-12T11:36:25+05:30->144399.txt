Artist, writer and the 'muhboli behen' of   has gone for a makeover once again.
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  When asked about her new look,"I have completely sealed past chapters of my life so thought why I shouldn't bring out the new me. I was starting a new journey so thought why not try something new and I always wanted a new hair style. The feedback for the new looks is good and I have received few offers and once I get a role which I am comfortable doing I will go ahead for it.And yes I lost weight but I never count kilos the best
  funda is not to count the kilos."
  
  
  We asked about her inspiration for the look she said, "Me myself and I. I love   and when I was in school I used to look at her hair style and would tell myself one day I am going to have something like this."
  
  Recently there was a buzz in the industry about her bagging a couple of films. Speaking about the same she said, "Yes I am getting many offers but nothing has been finalised. I have given a thought, will do when something clicks."
  
  The diva, who is also involved in art and writing, feels she can create a different world with her talent and that also gives her a special power.
