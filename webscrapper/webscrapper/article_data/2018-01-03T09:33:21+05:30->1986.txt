HYDERABAD: Days after the Prof Tirupathi   committee released its recommendations on the school fee issue, Telangana’s deputy chief minister and education minister, Kadiam Srihari, assured members of   (HSPA) that the government will examine recommendations before issuing an official order.

 Speaking toTOI after a meeting with Srihari on Tuesday, HSPA members said that the minister promised to review the matter following objections raised by them. As part of its report submitted to the government, the committee had suggested that the state permit private unaided schools to enhance fee by 10% every year.
 
 “We urged the minister to intervene and reject the recommendations. The minister replied that he has not seen the report and will ask the principal secretary, education department,   to examine it in detail,” read the press release issued by the HSPA.
 
 The delegation explained to the minister that with a 10% yearly hike, the cost of education would skyrocket to more than 800% by the time the child completes schooling. When parents demanded that the minister bring in law on par with that passed in   recently to regulate school fee, “the minister replied that he will request advocate general to examine existing stays on various petitions and see what all can be done,” the release added.
 
 Meanwhile, the government issued notification for the admissions into all schools. Schools can accept applications from Jan 3 to 8 and can scrutinise them on Jan 9 and 10. They can finalise the admissions by random selection method in the presence of parents on Jan 11and declare the final list on their website on Jan 12. The GO further states that all schools must adhere to the rules mentioned in GO Ms No 1issued in 1994 and not collect any capitation fee or conduct a screening process.
