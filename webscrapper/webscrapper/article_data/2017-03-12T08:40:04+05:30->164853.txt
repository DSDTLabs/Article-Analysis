COIMBATORE: Slamming the state government's decision to increase   (VAT) on  , entrepreneur-turned-politician 'Ma Foi'   on Saturday said the move shows the bad   the state is in. 

 Former chief minister   had always maintained that VAT on petroleum products should not be increased, Pandiarajan said while speaking at 'JumpStart2017', a start-up conclave conducted by the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry jointly with TiE. . "Even when other states increased the tax,   did not. This is veering away from Amma's vision. This desperate move is a sign of how bad the state's finances are," the former minister charged. The MLA hoped that the state government would start preparing for the   (GST), which will come to force from July 1.
