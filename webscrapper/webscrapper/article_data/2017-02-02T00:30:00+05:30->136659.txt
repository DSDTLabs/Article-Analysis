Bengaluru: The   ( ) 2017 will now be conducted in 10 languages, and Kannada is one of them. 

 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has put up an instruction/information bulletin on NEET website cbseneet.nic.in which says students appearing for the test across centres in Karnataka can opt for writing the answer paper in Kannada.
 
 In December 2016, the HRD ministry said the test would be held in Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Telugu and Tamil. Kannada Development Authority chairman S G Siddaramaiah, unhappy with the decision, urged the ministry to conduct it in Kannada too. Now, other than Kannada, Odiya has been added to the list as well.
