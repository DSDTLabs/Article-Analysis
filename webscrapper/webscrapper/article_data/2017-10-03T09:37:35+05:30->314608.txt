They were let off in the evening. A similar protest was held at Thanjavur but no arrests were reported.
 
 Writer and DMK member Manushyaputhiran, who was part of the group, condemned the police action, terming it "undemocratic”. Manushyaputhiran was arrested when he attempted to stage a sit-in protest.

 Theatre activist A Mangai said, "Protests against the killing of Lankesh were held all across the country but there was no interference by police elsewhere.” The protestors raised banners that carried slogans such as ‘Those Who Killed Gandhi Killed Gauri’.
 
  "Fascism is spreading in different ways. Tamil Nadu has developed an undemocratic political culture which is a fertile ground for Hindutva movements to take root,” said writer V Geetha.
