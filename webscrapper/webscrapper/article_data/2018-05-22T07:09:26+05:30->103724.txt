 A DPCC committee has found irregularities in operation of the STP. Meanwhile, hotel authorities said they have taken several steps to fix the problem since the notice was issued.
 
 NDMC has been asked to submit the compliance report within 15 days. A senior official from the civic body, however, said that they are examining the order and after the inspection by DPCC is over, further action will be initiated as per NDMC Act.
 
 The notice dated May 11 accessed by TOI states that an inspection by a team led by a senior environment engineer found several deficiencies in the 128KLD plant, which included shabby condition of filter press, proper aeration in equalisation tank not being maintained, poor ventilation system and missing sludge treatment.
 
 On April 29, three people out of five affected had died due to inhaling gas leaking from the STP. The sludge pit where the accident took place is underground. It was observed during inspection that the STP’s condition is very septic and only recirculation of waste water is being carried out. 
 
 The actual treatment is not being done resulting in untreated waste water being discharged, which is in violation of the consent issued under Water Act 1974, the notice added.
 
 “Pursuant to the notice received, we were advised to install an alternative treatment plant. This has subsequently been installed and specific approvals are awaited. We will continue to cooperate with the authorities. Further action will be taken based on the directions of the bodies,” said a Vivanta Ambassador spokesperson.
