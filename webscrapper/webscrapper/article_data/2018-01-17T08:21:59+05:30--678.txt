MADURAI: Over 1,200 tonnes of garbage was cleared by corporation workers after two days of Pongal festival in the city. Large chunks of garbage had accumulated in many parts of the city as residents seemed to have heeded the request of officials to refrain from burning things on Bhogi this year. 

 District collector K   and corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar had requested the people to ensure that they celebrated a ‘smokeless’ Bhogi by refraining from burning plastics and garbage. According to TNPCB ( ) sources, Madurai air was much cleaner compared to the smog in Chennai. 
 
 Civic authorities ensured that the garbage was cleared even on the day of Pongal. The activities were carried out with minimal sanitary workers as government holidays followed the two days of the festival. Thus, only the important areas in the city were cleaned.
 
 On Monday, as much as 620 tonnes of garbage was collected in the city and taken to the dumping yard in  , while 650 tonnes was collected on Tuesday. The amount of garbage to be cleared is expected to go up on Wednesday when all sanitary workers will report for duty and clean all residential areas.
 
 Meanwhile, many residents associations in the city, which celebrated their annual ceremonies for Pongal, have been urged to segregate their garbage. They have been told to use biodegradable wastes to prepare compost at their own places. Solid waste management still evades Madurai as people still fail to segregate their garbage while handing it over to sanitary workers in spite of repeated requests made by the civic body.
