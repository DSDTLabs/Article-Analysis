NEW DELHI: After being slammed on several occasions for not taking effective steps to tackle the pollution crisis in the national capital region, the government came in for praise on Monday from the Supreme Court that appreciated its   to make air breathable not only in Delhi but in all cities.

 A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and   also approved the   comprehensive plan to tackle the problem of stubble burning in neighbouring states of Delhi. With the pollution crisis increasing with each passing year in the NCR, the Centre had set up a high level task force under the principal secretary to the Prime Minister to deal with the crisis and the panel set up a sub-committee to exclusively suggest measures to deal with stubble-burning which is one of the main reasons for deteriorating air quality in NCR in winter.
 
 As per the plan, the Centre has decided to provide subsidies to farmers to purchase machines —Happy Seeder and Rotavators — for in-situ management of paddy residue. A flat subsidy of 50 % of the cost of the machinery would be given through the direct benefit transfer mechanism to individual farmers who are willing to buy machines and in case of cooperative societies, farmers’ interest groups or gram panchayats, a subsidy of 75 % of the cost of the machinery would be provided. 
 
 Additional solicitor general A N S Nadkarni, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that the government had framed rules on dust-mitigation measures for construction and demolition activities. Cities and towns where the hazardous particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) exceeds the prescribed limits would now have to implement measures to reduce dust.
