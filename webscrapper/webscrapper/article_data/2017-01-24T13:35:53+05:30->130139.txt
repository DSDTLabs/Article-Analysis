PATNA:  , one of the components of upcoming International Convention Centre (ICC) in the city, will be inaugurated on March 22 when the state will celebrate  .
 
  Located on the north-western corner of   in front of  , the ICC is spread over 11.82 acre and has five components: a convention hall, Gyan Bhawan, an auditorium, Sabhyata Dwar and a food court. The complex is divided into two parts connected with a subway.
  
  The Gyan Bhawan is a two-floor structure with an exhibition hall on the ground floor with a capacity to accommodate 2,000 people and a conference hall on the first floor with a capacity to accommodate 800 people.
  
  State building construction department (BCD) officials and engineers are burning midnight oil to complete the work as CM   wants to commence the yearlong Champaran centenary celebrations with an international seminar on Mahatma Gandhi at the ICC on April 18.
  
  The interiors of Gyan Bhawan will be similar to those of Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. “The structure is ready. We are currently working on the floor, walls and false ceiling. We will ready it by March 10,” a BCD engineer said on Monday.
  
  The ICC project is already delayed by more than a year as it was scheduled to be completed by November 2015. “The work on the structure and floor of the main convention hall has been completed and we target to ready it by July. Similar is the progress of the food court and Sabhyata Dwar work,” said the engineer.
  
  The project was conceptualised in 2012 during the Global Bihar Summit, when the need of a big convention centre was felt. The   has only 1,500 seats.
  
  The ICC is being constructed by Ahluwalia Contracts (India) Ltd. The main convention hall is a four-floor, 35-metre high structure being built using 21,600 metric ton of steel. It is proposed to be an iconic quake-resistant building with a 450-vehcile parking space in the basement.
