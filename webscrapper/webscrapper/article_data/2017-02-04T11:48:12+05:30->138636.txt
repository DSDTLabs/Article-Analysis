SHILLONG: After the   recently upheld the May 31, 2016 ruling by former governor   that the post of   (MDC) is not an office of profit, the BJP state unit now wants chief minister   to step down. 

 BJP claims Mukul tried to do away with the district council by passing the anti-dual post act in the assembly. 
 
 "We demand that the chief minister Mukul Sangma step down as he took the people of the state for a ride by passing such an Act," state BJP president Shibun Lyngdoh said on Friday.
 
 The Prevention of Disqualification (Members of Legislative Assembly, Meghalaya) (Amendment) Act, 2015 was passed by the Congress-led Meghalaya United Alliance government that subsequently led to the resignation of at least seven out of eight legislators who had been holding dual posts. TNN
