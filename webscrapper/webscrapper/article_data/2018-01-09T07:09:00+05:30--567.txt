Chandigarh: The ministry of urban development, on Monday, gave its nod to the Chandigarh administrationâ€™s proposal to introduce battery-operated buses in its fleet.

 The ministry gave a go ahead to the administration for purchase of the buses. Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) will now float a tender to purchase a total of 20 battery-operated buses. Each of these buses will cost around Rs 5 crore and the central government has agreed to fund 60% of it. According to sources, the tender will be floated by Friday.
 
 CTU plans to induct electric buses in its fleet with an aim to cut down the level of the vehicular pollution. Over the years, the quality of air in the city has deteriorated. Data compiled by the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) in last few years shows the level of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) has been recorded above the permissible limits, that is, 100 microgram per cubic metre (mcg/cu-m).
 
 CTU had submitted the proposal after conducting the trials of two buses manufactured by two different firms. The run was conducted on a stretch between Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education (PGIMER) and Rajiv Gandhi Chandigarh Technology Park (RGCTP) covering a distance of over 240km daily.
 
 During the trial, a weight of around 1,750kg was put in the buses. An 11-member team was constituted for inspection and compiling a report. Based on the report put forward by the team, the authorities decided to purchase the battery-operated buses. According to officials, the battery-operated buses have a life of 10 years and cover over 250km after being charged. It takes around 6 hours to charge the bus.
 
 At present, CTU has 539 buses, of which 413 run on local/suburban routes connecting Chandigarh with Panchkula and Mohali. The buses ferry about 2 lakh passengers daily. On an average, a CTU bus plies 389.83 passengers per bus per day.
