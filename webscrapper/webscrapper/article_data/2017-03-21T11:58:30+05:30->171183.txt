NAGPUR: The general body meeting on Monday gave its nod to the   general administration department’s (GAD) proposal to restructure the 10 zones based on the 38 wards. For the civic polls,   had formed two additional zones — RGGB and Durga Nagar.

 In its proposal, the GAD suggested eight zones with four wards each and two will have three wards each. Accordingly,   has demarcated boundaries of 38 wards under 10 zones. But when the proposal came up for discussion, many corporators expressed anguish over parts of their wards extending into other zones. For example, earlier Friend’s   came under the Mangalwari zone but now it will be under the Dharampeth zone.
 
 The protesters felt that the new zone structure taxpayers will undergo difficulties. However, the mayor ignored the corporators’ demand and gave nod to the administration’s proposal.
 
 Accordingly, Laxmi Nagar zone will have four wards — 16, 36, 37 and 38; Dharampeth — 12, 13, 14 and 15; Hanuman Nagar — 31, 32, 34 and 29, Dhantoli — 17, 33 and 35; Nehru Nagar — 27, 28, 30 and 26; Gandhibagh — 08, 18, 19 and 22; Satranjipura — 05, 20 and 21; Lakadganj — 23, 24, 25 and 4; Ashi Nagar — 02, 03, 06 and 07 and Mangalwari — 1, 09, 10 and 11.
