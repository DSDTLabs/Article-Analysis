LUCKNOW: With the SP-Congress pact sealed, the focus is now on   who is relying on Muslim votes to return to power. 

 Mayawati has given 97 tickets to Muslims, the maximum allotment to the community ever by her party, to stitch a Dalit-Muslim combination against the BJP.
 
 The SP-Congress alliance, experts say, could wean away some Muslim votes which Mayawati may have consolidated after the SP feud broke out. Mayawati has been trying to drive a wedge in the SP camp by pitting the warring camps of Akhilesh and his uncle Shivpal Yadav against each other, while appealing to Muslims to vote for BSP en-bloc.
 
 BSP leaders, however, maintain that the SP-Congress alliance will not affect their party. "The voters are fed up with all the drama played by the SP camp while Congress has lost its mass appeal," said a BSP functionary. "Moreover, we have moved far ahead of our rivals in reaching out to voters of all communities," said another BSP leader. 
 
  Political commentator JP Shukla said Mayawati's core Dalit vote base could still drive Muslims to vote in favour of the BSP to arrest the surge of BJP. 
 
 Congress's move to join hands with the SP, observers say, could have frustrated Mayawati on account of the fact that she helped in saving the Congress government in Uttarakhand and then helped it in Rajya Sabha elections last year. "The party does feel ditched," said a BSP leader close to Mayawati.
 
 The BSP supremo is learnt to have anticipated the SP-Congress alliance more than a month ago and had stepped her attacks on the Grand Old Party. Maintaining that the pact was a part of a larger conspiracy to divide the Muslim votes, Mayawati had even said that such alliance was being chalked out at the behest of SP patriarch   to benefit the BJP.
