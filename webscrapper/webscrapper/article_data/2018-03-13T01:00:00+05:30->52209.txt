For the past few months, a couple of rumours have been doing the rounds about Ekta Kapoor’s TV show, '  Tere Pyaar Ki'. It was being speculated that the show, which has been running for two years, is going off air. Buzz was also that its lead actress   is making an exit. 

 Though the channel and the actress repeatedly refuted the rumours, talks of the actress quitting the show because of pregnancy surfaced a few days ago.
 
 While   has confirmed that the show won’t go off air, sources said that   might end her tryst with it. A source said, “Kasam is economically viable for the producers. Also, it recently got a year’s extension. Kratika is not pregnant, but she is not planning to renew her contract. She feels that the role is getting monotonous and she wants to try new things.”
 
 On the other hand, Kratika denied any such move on her part. She told BT, “I just returned from a scuba diving trip. Had I been pregnant, my doctor would not have allowed it. Rumours of the show going off air and me quitting it have been doing the rounds for many months. As of now, I am not leaving it.”
