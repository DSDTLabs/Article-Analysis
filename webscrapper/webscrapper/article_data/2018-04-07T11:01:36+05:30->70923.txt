RAJKOT: Members of the rift-ridden  , the most influential Leuva   organization, tried to paint an ‘all is well’ picture on Friday. 

 Temple trust’s chairman   admitted that he had resigned from the organization but added in the same breath that it was a mistake which hurt the trust’s reputation. “The situation could have been handled in a better way. I should not have hurt the feelings of our community members and put the trust’s reputation at stake and I apologize for the same,” said Patel addressing media persons along with president Paresh Gajera. 
 
 Patel denied there was any internal dispute in the temple trust. Gajera, who had said on Thursday that he would resign as the president, also changed his mind and decided to continue. “I felt pained by the slogans against me, but Nareshbhai convinced me that it was the handiwork of some miscreants who don’t want us to work. If he asks me to resign, I will surely do so,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, several posters in support of Patel came up on the walls in the Patidar-dominated areas. 
 
 Even as the temple trust has maintained that it is a non-political organization, both BJP and   had tried to influence its followers in the assembly elections in December last year. 
 
 On Friday, the trustees said they would l form a special committee that will frame rules as to how they should act during elections.
 
 “We will form an 11-member committee under the leadership of   to frame the rules for trustees and the trust as to how we should act during election time.,” Gajera said. The committee will constitute select persons from the different fields and every two years one-third members will change. 
 
 Even as Patel and Gajera attempted to cap the week-long controversy, insiders said all is not well within the organization.
