NEW DELHI: The   ( ) has come down hard on an applicant for filing multiple applications with a view to harass the public authority. 

 Information commissioner   called out the actions of the applicant, who had filed a slew of pleas after a dispute with a neighbour. “The commission notes that the appellant is a habitual litigant and has been raising myriad queries about numerous complaints he has filed before various public offices. 
 
 It is evident his queries are not aimed at achieving any information or to serve any purpose,”   said. Azad said the “bombardment” of queries was “a wasteful and completely uncalled for activity and a gross abuse of the Act”. The appellant, in this instance, had filed 16   applications to the PMO, LG’s office,   and Delhi police. 
 
 The matter was a disagreement with a neighbour, which had resulted in a police complaint. Previous RTI pleas showed that the matter had been investigated by the police and the appellant was found lying in his complaint, the order noted. 
 
 Warning the appellant that any further requests for information would not be heard by the commission, Azad said, “The commission, therefore, is constrained to warn the appellant to be more careful in future and refrain from relentless agitation over the same issue.”
