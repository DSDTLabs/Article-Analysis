SURAT: Supporters of Patidar quota stir leader   and administration staff of Dharukawala College had a scuffle on Thursday. The fight began after some students from the college alleged that they were not being allowed by the administration to meet Hardik. 
Hardik arrived in the city to mark his presence at the detetion of crime branch (DCB) as per bail conditions. 
 
 After completing the formality at DCB, he visited different areas in the city to meet supporters. His supporters had planned a visit outside Dharukawala College on Varachha Road in Kapodara where students were called to meet him.
 
 The location decided was outside college campus but the students claimed that they were not allowed to go out of the college and the administration officials closed the gates. Hardikâ€™s supporters alleged that the college authorities had come to know about the plan and hence took police support to disrupt the meeting.
 
 Later, two groups came face to face when Hardik went inside the campus with supporters to talk to the authorities. The authorities refused to allow him to meet the students since the exams were going on. In the meantime, two groups started pushing and hitting each other. However, the fight was controlled by some members from both sides and Hardik left the campus.
 
 Hardik also held small public meetings in Mahidharpura, Mini Bazaar and Mota Varachha area. A road show was also organized in Mota Varachha on Thursday night.
