CHENNAI: Thanks to community participation, the 57-acre   is brimming with water, even as summer approaches after a failed northeast monsoon. Around 2,000 residents gathered through the day for the annual Perungudi lake festival where chief guest actor Vivek lauded the residents’ initiative to keep the neighbourhood green.

 At least 10 residents volunteer every Saturday to clean the lake. They carry out desilting, and remove plastic and other garbage from the lakebed. As part of the sustained effort to keep the lake free from pollution and exploitation by encroachers, the Perungudi Lake Area Neighbourhood Environmental Transformation (PLANET) Association keeps a constant vigil.
 
 Sajeevan, one of the volunteers, said, “Regular cleaning of the lake has enriched the groundwater in Perungudi. Through our neighbourhood watch, we have reduced the frequency of open defecation. But we have a long way to go.” Residents of the nearby Kallukutai use the lake to wash clothes. 
 
 As part of the lake festival, PLANET Association conducted an exhibition of photographs shot around the lake. 
 
 School children took part in a painting competition earlier in the day, while traditional games like uriyadithal, sack race, puliyattam, silambattam and other cultural programmes kept the crowd energised. Homemakers attended workshops on home composting, pest control and terrace gardening. 
 
 Actor Vivek cautioned residents that the approaching summer could be punishing due to the loss of tree cover to Cyclone Vardah. 
 
 “I had met chief minister O Panneerselvam to ask him for a tree plantation drive. It has still to come to fruition.” Vivek is been part of several green initiatives told the residents not to plant saplings. 
 
 “It would be advisable to bring grown trees from places like Rajahmundry instead of planting saplings. Saplings will take a very long time to become trees. Many of the trees that fell during Vardah were as old as your grandmother.”
