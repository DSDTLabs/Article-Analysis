AHMEDABAD: It took the death of two youths — who perished while taking selfies on Sant Sarovar barrage gates on Monday —for the water resources and water heads division of the roads and buildings (R&B) department to consider enhancing security at the barrage. The district collector and the Gandhinagar district SP have asked the two departments to create a security perimeter around the barrage.

 In Ahmedabad, the municipal corporation does not allow people to visit Vasna barrage, citing sabotage fears and safety concerns. In the state capital Gandhinagar, it has been just the opposite. For close to three months, Sant Sarovar had turned into a picnic spot despite several warnings from the local police and the fire department. 
 
 Gandhinagar district collector S K Langa said, “A coordination meeting of departmental representatives from the R&B, water resources, district police, and my office will meet to plan signage and security at the barrage site.” Gandhinagar Fire and   on Monday night had fished out the bodies of Vishal Trivedi, 20, and Kanu Dhuliya, 35, from Sant Sarovar near Indroda Park. 
 
 They were residents of Sardarnagar. The duo was reported missing on Monday evening. Their group had visited the barrage. On Tuesday, fire officials spent several hours at the barrage site requesting visitors to stay away from the spillway and forced a few visitors to climb down from the sluice gates.
