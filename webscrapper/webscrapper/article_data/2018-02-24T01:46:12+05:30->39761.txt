NEW DELHI:   said at a public meeting on Friday that officers like chief secretary Anshu Prakash should be beaten up because they block files important for development work for the common man. The statement was made in the presence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “The chief secretary has made a false allegation about the physical assault, which never took place. But such officers should be beaten up,” said Balyan, a social worker turned politician.

 In the evening, senior AAP leader Atishi Marlena condemned Balyan’s statement. “All government officers need to be treated respectfully and AAP government believes in working in collaboration with them for Delhi's development,” she tweeted.
 
 But the whole day, Balyan kept on repeating his controversial statement everywhere, even when TOI called him up. It’s feared that it might create a deeper wedge between the   and the political executive. The bureaucrats have already boycotted the government and have threatened to be at it until the chief minister apologises for it. 
 
 An officer said Kejriwal made a speech after Balyan’s controversial statement. “Most of the bureaucrats have condemned the statement. It is a serious matter as the MLA is advocating violence against officers,” he said. 
 
 Balyan said beating up of officers was his own opinion. “Around 4,000 people in my constituency are deprived of subsidised rations. The officers are not bothered about it. Every day. complaints come to my office, but the officers are not listening,” Balyan said to justify his statement.
