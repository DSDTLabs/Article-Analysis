THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: If you thought you are safe indoors, here comes the shocker. According to  , the   and   have brought in a major change to the breeding spots of mosquitoes, which have now migrated from backyards to indoors. 

 As many as 50 houses were visited by a team of officers from the health department and district vector control unit across 42 wards of the city corporation.
 
 District medical officer ( ) Jose G D’cruz said the people who live in flats and apartments were equally susceptible to  . 
 
 “Lifestyle change is the main reason behind the community outbreak and the only way to counter this is by changing hygiene practices,” the DMO said.
 
 People tend to dump paper cups and tins on sunshades, which later turn into breeding spaces. Also, indoor plants and flush tanks of less-used toilets provide ample space for the vectors to multiply.
 
 In places like Beemapally, dotted with tightly-packed rows of houses, discarded furniture and vessels on terrace turn into breeding grounds. “The only way to address the crisis is by keeping ones one premises hygienic,’’ said the DMO.
 
 “In earlier times, abandoned toys, plastic containers and coconut shells in the backyards were found to be the main breeding spaces for mosquitos. Now, water collected under refrigerators and air conditioners are breeding hotspots,” said Dr Neena Rani, district surveillance officer and additional DMO in charge of public health.
 
 The team noted that at Vattiyoorkavu almost all houses have old model refrigerators with trays beneath where water gets collected.
 
 The staff at the vector control unit attribute the surge in dengue to public callousness.
 
 “We made door-to-door visits to spread awareness regarding control measures. It was observed that most of the households we have visited so far had abandoned plastic tins and egg shells inside their homes. In spite of our warning, they continue to keep their premises unhygienic,’’ said a staff member.
