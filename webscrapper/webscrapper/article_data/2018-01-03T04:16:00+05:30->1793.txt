Vadodara: An RTO agent was arrested on Monday in connection with a documents forgery case registered at City police station last month by special operations group (SOG) of city police.

 The accused Shahnawaz alias Shanu Pathan’s name had cropped up during investigation of forgery case which was registered against Usman Farooq Sheikh. SOG sleuths had raided Usman’s house on December 7 and had found forged identity documents like passport, voter’s identity card, aadhar card, driving licence, PAN card and school leaving certificate. The police had learnt during the course of investigation that Usman’s passport was seized by the government of Saudi Arabia and he was deported to India in April 2008.
 
 Since Usman wanted to travel to a foreign country, he got a forged passport made through one Asif Sheikh and Shailesh Soni. Asif and Soni, a peon of Sharda Mandir School in Raopura, were arrested later. During Usman’s interrogation police also learnt how he got other documents made.
 
 Later, Soni told the cops that he had taken a blank leaving certificate from the school and had given to Pathan to fill it. A police official said that Pathan was also involved in another forgery case which was registered at Panigate police station early last year.
