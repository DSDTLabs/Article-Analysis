Mumbai: Former Tata Sons chairman   said that   — who retired from the chairmanship of Tata Sons in December 2012 after working with the group for five decades — started making deep inroads into how his successor must handle problems in the conglomerate within weeks of his retirement.

 Appearing before the   ( ) in the minority shareholder oppression and mismanagement proceedings, Mistry’s counsel Somasekhar Sundaresan said that the very first intervention by Ratan Tata in less than five weeks of his retirement had set the tone. Sundaresan pointed out that Ratan Tata, after looking at a media report that appeared post-retirement, wrote to Mistry on how he must handle the problem, the measures he must take and how to deal with external stakeholders.
 
 Sundaresan argued that Ratan Tata’s tone of language moved from polite to aggressive after Tata Sons’ Articles of Association (AoA) was amended, which brought in provisions to regulate how the holding company of the group must govern the operating entities. 
 
 After the amendments, Ratan Tata started alleging and threatening breach of the AoA, which demonstrated that even if the initial advice was benign, it went on to exercise control, Sundaresan said on Tuesday. External influence from outside the Tata Sons board can only hurt the integrity and the sacrosanct nature of governance in a company, he pointed out.
