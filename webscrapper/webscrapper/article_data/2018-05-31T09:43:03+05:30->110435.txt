 The results of the   Class XII exam have recorded an average of 83.01%, with the All-India topper getting 499 out of 500. Not much is different in our state, with students getting as much as 99%. Surprisingly, none of the national toppers took coaching classes. Therefore, the credit for their astounding marks must go to their individual effort and the support of their teachers. 
 
 The importance of the last factor cannot be overstated. However, it is often undervalued. I feel it is imperative for teachers to understand the child's ability, aptitude and competence. The primary objective of a school education is to ensure the student's happiness and positivity; this is directly proportional to the happiness and the positivity of the teacher. A student will love a subject if the teacher is positive and affable.
 
 Educators have to be positive and happy to create a proper atmosphere for learning for the children. Students end up getting full marks in a subject only because of their love for it, which can be aided by respect for the teacher teaching it.
 
 The pressure of board exams has led to the mushrooming of coaching centres, which not only hurt students' motivation and self-confidence but prevent them from becoming self-sufficient.
 
 Coaching centres and tuitions have a negative impact on school education. Schools must discourage teachers from letting their students take tuitions. Classroom teaching cannot be substituted by coaching classes as this makes the students complacent and the teachers, money-driven. The toppers of this year have repeatedly shown that it is the teachers' effort, classroom teaching and hard work that pushes them towards excellence.
 
 It is important that we equip our children with the skills required to confront global challenges with courage, resolution and determination.
