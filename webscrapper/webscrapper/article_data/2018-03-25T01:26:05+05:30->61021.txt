GURUGRAM: Two arms of Haryana government appear to be unaware of each other’s projects to curb road   and make the city safe by installing   cameras. 

 While   (GMDA) didn’t know that the chief minister’s office had announced installation of CCTV cameras at 29 key junctions as part of ‘Vision Zero’ project, the latter was not aware of the authority’s pilot programme to also keep an eye on roads for traffic violations, law and order, and civic problems.
 
 On Thursday, the principal secretary to the chief minister, Rakesh Gupta, announced that Gurugram will get CCTV cameras at 29 key junctions to identify speeding vehicles, particularly on NH-8 which runs through the city, as part of a state-wide initiative in 10 districts where the ‘Vision Zero’ programme is being run to curb road accident mortalities.
 
 However, GMDA is already running a pilot project, which is to be expanded through the city, to implement CCTV cameras for multiple objectives, including traffic violations.
 
 When contacted, GMDA chief V. Umashankar said on Friday that he was not “aware of the other project” to install CCTV cameras, being carried out by the CMO under its Haryana   programme, by issuing challans using automatic feed from the CCTV cameras which get linked to the police control room.
 
 “GMDA’s CCTV project’s is currently going on in parts of old Gurugram, and the implementation across the city should start in a month and a half. The GMDA project will have cameras at 88 junctions at key traffic intersections apart from other parts of the city, and set to cost around than Rs 50 crore,” he added.
 
 Similarly, Gupta admitted he was also not aware of GMDA’s project. But he said: “If such a project is already going on in Gurugram, then both the departments can coordinate and pool their resources towards the projects. We don’t intend to extend the projects beyond the 10 districts to entire Haryana.”
