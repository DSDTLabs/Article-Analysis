BENGALURU: The second meeting of the BBMP with the bankers and NIC remained inconclusive on Wednesday. MK Gunasekar, chairman of the   on taxation and   admitted that they could not find a solution to the technical problems while filing property tax online. "I am hoping to finalise something in the next meeting on April 19," he told TOI.

 Meantime, the glitches with online payment of property taxes continue.   fume over the fact that they are waiting for hours logging on the BBMP website and the payment is not made or gets failed again and again. In many cases, the rebate of five percent has not been credited or does not reflect in their tax sheet. Most citizens aim to pay their propertya tax by April 30 in order to avail the rebate that BBMP offers for early birds.
 
 These glitches continue despite it being the second year when Palike made it mandatory to pay property taxes online. It has received a little over Rs26 crores of property tax till Tuesday, said officials.
