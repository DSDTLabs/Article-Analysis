PATNA: One Ramvilash Yadav (65) and his son Pappu Yadav (40) were gunned down in their fields at   under the Ghoswari police station area of   subdivision in Patna district on Friday.

 Ghoswari police station SHO Bibhuti Bhushan Kumar said preliminary investigations revealed that they were killed in revenge of the murder of one Arun Yadav (42) in the village over an alleged land dispute on April 7. Ramvilash’s younger son Nunulal Yadav (35) was allegedly involved in Arun’s murder, he said.
 
 “Ramvilash was   in his chest and Pappu in his head. Their bodies were found lying in the fields a couple of feet away from each other. At least seven empty cartridges were recovered from the spot,” Kumar said.
 
 He said a few villagers told the police at least seven to eight armed men with a few carrying rifles were seen going toward the fields where the deceased were working. One of them was identified, but fled from village after the incident.
 
 The SHO said Arun was involved in a land dispute with one fellow villager Srikant Yadav (45). “In police investigation, it surfaced that Ramvilash’s younger son Nunulal had supported Srikant and his associates on April 7 against Arun. Srikant and Nunulal are among the four named accused in Arun’s murder case. All the four are evading arrest,” he said.
 
 Barh ASP Manoj Tiwary said they had a dispute over 1.5 feet broad strip of farming land on which both Arun and Srikant claimed ownership. “Their bodies were sent to Barh subdivisional hospital for post mortem,” he added.
