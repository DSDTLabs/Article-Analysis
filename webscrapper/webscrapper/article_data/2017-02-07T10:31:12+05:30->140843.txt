NEW DELHI: The upcoming one-off Test between India and   in Hyderabad will be the ninth played between the two teams, and the first on Indian soil. India have won six of their eight Test matches against Bangladesh, four by an innings and one by ten wickets. The two draws came in 2007 and 2015, matches which were both hit by inclement weather. 

 Here’s a recap of India’s wins over Bangladesh. 
 
 
 
 Bangladesh’s entry to Test cricket began promisingly, but faded quickly. Played at the erstwhile home of Bangladesh cricket, the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka, this Test saw a big crowd and heightened anticipation when the hosts won the toss and chose to bat. From 44/2, Bangladesh were led to a strong platform by   (71) and Aminul Islam, who scored 145 to push the total to 400 in 153.overs. India then struggled, slipping to 191/5, but were revived via their captain   (84), Sunil Joshi (92) and Ajit Agarkar (34) to post 429. Naimur Rahman, Bangladesh’s captain, finished with figures of 6/132 from 44.3 overs, but what proceeded left the Bangladesh fans stunned and India on course for a facile win. Bangladesh made 91 in 46.3 overs, setting India a target of 63. They won with ease. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Another big win for Ganguly’s team, courtesy a poor first innings from Bangladesh. Irfan Pathan’s 5/45 helped bowl the host out for 184, after which   hit his highest Test score (248*) while adding a then record tenth-wicket partnership with   (75) to get the total to 526. Irfan added six more as Bangladesh were dismissed for 202, the left-arm pacer thus getting the nod for Man of the Match.
 
 
 
 
 India had few hassles in making it 2-0 in the next Test. Ganguly opted to bat, Gautam Gambhir (139) and Rahul Dravid (160) made hundreds, the skipper 88, and 540 was on the board. Despite a stroke-filled unbeaten 158 from Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh could only reply with 333 and Ganguly enforced the folllow-on. Irfan once again tormented Bangladesh, taking five wickets to bowl them out for 124. He was named Man of the Series. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 The first Test was hit by rain, but India made up for lost time by crushing Bangladesh in the final match. On a batting surface, Bashar’s decision to field came a cropper as Dinesh Karthik (129), Wasim Jaffer (138), skipper Dravid (129) and Tendulkar (122*) buried Bangladesh with a total of 610/3 declared. On that same surface, Zaheer grabbed 5/34 to bowl out the hosts for 118. Dravid made Bangladesh bat again, and they got as far as 253. The match was over inside three days. 
 
 
 
 
 Even before a ball was bowled, Virender Sehwag fired the first salvo. On match eve, he termed Bangladesh an “ordinary side” because they “can’t take 20 wickets”. It may have riled the home team, but they still did not bowl India out twice and batted inadequately in both innings. India were made to work hard for runs in the first innings, and without Tendulkar’s unbeaten 105 would not have gotten as far as 243. Bangladesh were kept to 242 and that’s where the match was won. Gambhir (116), Amit Mishra (50), VVS Laxman (69*) helped India to 413/8 declared, and set a target of 415 Bangladesh were bowled out for 301. 
 
 
 
 
 A ten-wicket win wrapped up another 2-0 series victory for India. Zaheer and Ishant Sharma made early inroads as Bangladesh slipped to 13/3, and only an unbeaten 96 from Mahmudullah got them to 233. Centuries to Dravid (111) and Tendulkar (143) and 89 from the captain MS Dhoni led India to 544/8 declared, after which it was Tamim Iqbal’s turn to lead another one-way innings from Bangladesh. His 151 off 183 balls was almost half of their 312, leaving India to chase just two runs. Zaheer was Man of the Match for his 3/62 and 7/87, as well as Man of the Series.
