PUNE: All three education regulatory bodies will undergo sweeping reforms, HRD minister   said at the convocation address in Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics on Monday. 

 The three organizations are All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), which is the national-level regulating body covering technical institutes,   (UGC), which regulates university education in the country, and National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE), which regulates teachers' education and quality of teachers.
 
 "Regulatory bodies should not create difficulties. We are going to reform the entire regulatory mechanism of UGC, AICTE, NCTE. They will be seamless, transparent, and efficient, map quality, have the same rules and will not consume time. We are going to bring this reform in all regulatory bodies soon," he added.
 
 He said relevant research that supports uplift of the poor is needed. "Education is subsidised and people contribute to education. We should do research that serves the poor. Job satisfaction is important and that will come when you help uplift the poor," the minister said.
 
 He said the PV   government changed the country's licence raj and put the country on the road to development.
 
 "We need students to contribute to the nation without bias. In the last seven months, 600 courses have been uploaded on the Swayam platform on which 17 lakh people have registered," he added.
 
 Universities have been told to revise their curricula every year. "Even if the universities do not have new curricula, we will have AICTE and UGC upload revised curricula every year that the universities can replicate if they want to,"   added.
 
 National Assessment and Accreditation Council gives accreditation to colleges. "Institutes that have the highest   scores will automatically be given autonomy and they won't have to come to the ministry or regulatory bodies," he added.
