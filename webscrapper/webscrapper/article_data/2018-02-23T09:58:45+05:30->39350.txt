CHANDIGARH: A gang of distractors active in the Tricity for long took away Rs 85,000 cash, an iPhone, and vital documents from the   car of a Mohali woman near Hotel   around 1.30pm on Wednesday after fooling her father.

  of Sector 71 has stated in her complaint that she was inside in the hotel with her son to use the washroom and her father was sitting in the car and waiting for them when a man of about 25 knocked at the windowpane and told him that he had dropped his money outside. “Loveleen says her dad came out and found some currency indeed on the floor along with bits of paper,” said Zuldan Singh, officer in charge of the Sector-22 police post. “As he stepped out of the car, three to four people surrounded him so that he could not see their partners stealing items from the car.”
 
 
  
  
 
 When the woman came out of the hotel and found her purse missing from the car, she raised al alarm and asked the hotel guard and anyone seen around before she called the cops from Sector 22 to record her statement. The case was registered at the Sector 17 police station, however. Police are scanning images from the security cameras installed near the scene of crime.
 
 Loveleen Kaur told TOI that five-to-six people were involved in this crime. “They told him to pick up his money from around the rear tyre. The   footage from the hotel shows that the gang conned my father into coming out of the car so that they could steal my purse from inside. The bag contained cash that I was going to deposit in the bank.”
