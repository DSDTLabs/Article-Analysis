PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: An effort to clean up Pavana, Indrayani and   rivers plagued by water   and tonnes of plastic has begun. 

 The   has invited bids for removal of hyacinth. Environment experts had pointed out last October that hyacinth could become a menace in March. They said its growth was because of untreated industrial and domestic effluents discharged into the rivers.
 
 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, while attending a function in the temple town of Alandi on Monday, had said that the pollution of Indrayani river was because of the discharge of untreated effluents by the municipal corporation. He has promised funds of Rs 10 crore for checking pollution in the Indrayani, Mula and Mutha rivers.
 
 Environment expert Vikas Patil said the effluent treatment plants are not functioning properly and that untreated effluents are discharged into the river. An environment officer said 240MLD of the 260 MLD of effluents is treated.
 
 Senior civic officials said hyacinth is a biohazard and should be tackled at the earliest. Every year, machines pull out the weed but it grows back in stagnant water. A permanent solution is necessary, officials added.
 
 Health officials said the agencies would have to implement their work on their own and that the municipal corporation would not give machinery or manpower to them. PCMC has earmarked the areas for cleaning of the three rivers (see box).
