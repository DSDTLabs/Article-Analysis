Vadodara: Ahead of the 66th annual convocation at M S University where President Ram Nath Kovind will be chief guest on Monday, hoardings alleging irregularities by MSU vice-chancellor (VC) professor Parimal Vyas became a talking point in the city on Sunday. 

 Senate member from Faculty of Social Work Kapil Joshi, who had earlier written an open letter to the President urging him to decline invitation extended by MSU to grace convocation ceremony had put up the hoardings at Kalaghoda circle, Dairy Den circle and Fatehgunj circle. 
 
 The hoardings carried Vyas photographs along with his mark sheet and degree certificate of masters in commerce (M Com) programme in which he had secured 55.88 % while passing the programme in April 1984. 
 
 Joshi since quite some time has been challenging the dual professorship that Vyas, a teacher of Faculty of Commerce, has obtained from Faculty of Management Studies (FMS). 
 
 Joshi has alleged that Vyas has openly violated guidelines of the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) by obtaining the dual professorship in FMS where the minimum eligibility criteria is securing a first class at post-graduate level. 
 
 The hoardings which created a buzz in university circles on Sunday were later brought down by teams of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). 
 
 “VMC officials claimed that they were instructed to remove the hoardings as prior permission was not taken. But the fact remains that before two days I had already applied for putting up the hoardings. As a senate member it is my right and duty to spread awareness amongst citizens regarding such irregularities,” said Joshi.
