MEERUT: Two years after  , a BJP vice president for   constituency, was shot dead by local youths, his 60-year-old father Shobharam Arya was shot at by bike-borne men allegedly for not withdrawing the murder case. Shobharam, who received three bullets, including one that is lodged in his head, is stated to be critical.
 
  The incident took place on Thursday at Nangla Khepar village under Meerapur police station in Muzaffarnagar. According to police sources, the victim, also a local BJP worker, was returning from a Republic Day event at a local school when the miscreants opened fire at him. He was immediately rushed to the nearby hospital from where he was referred to Meerut.
  
  Shobharam was the main witness in the murder of his son two years ago. Sources also claimed that there was constant pressure upon him to withdraw the case.
  
  Kuldeep Singh, station officer, Meerapur police station, said, “We have filed an FIR against four persons, including a woman. The incident is related to the two-year-old murder case of Shobharam’s son. We are investigating the matter.”
  
  Alok Sisodia, media in-charge of western Uttar Pradesh for BJP, reacted sharply to the incident. “This is what we had been reiterating for so long. This case, along with other such instances of murder, is a clear reflection of the collapse of law and order in the state. Our party has been active in raising these issues and if our representatives or members are not safe you can very well imagine the state of common man,” he said.
