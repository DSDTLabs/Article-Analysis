He said there were not enough doctors in his place who would have the time to travel to Kolkata,” an investigating officer said. A police team has left for   in Burdwan to investigate the role of the nursing home after the victim’s uncle alleged that it had charged them a hefty sum.
 
 “We shall question one Vicky, who had posed as a nursing home employee and arranged the ambulance for the victim, Arijit Das’s, family. ,” an officer said. “They settled between Rs 8,000-Rs 18,000, depending on the spending ability of the patients’ families,” he added.
 
 Sarfarajuddin first claimed that he faked his identity on the insistence of the nursing home, but later retracted after several rounds of questioning. “He said he had connections with several nursing homes who supplied them with a steady stream patients,” the officer said.
