NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday said it would adjudicate whether   (ED) had the power to arrest in a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( ) and transferred to itself two petitions, including one by  , from the Delhi high court.

 
 Entertaining appeals by the ED, a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said since there were conflicting decisions by HCs — with Delhi, Punjab & Haryana, Bombay and Jharkhand holding in favour of the ED and Gujarat against it — it would be better that the   settled the issue.
 
 While transferring the two petitions to itself, the bench said the Delhi HC’s order restraining the ED from arresting Karti under PMLA would remain in place till March 26, when the SC will hear arguments on the issue.
 
 Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the  , despite the issue being settled by a two-judge bench earlier, had granted interim bail to those booked under PMLA by ED by entertaining their writ petitions. “With the issue of jurisdiction of the HCs not settled yet, this will open floodgates in over 1,000 PMLA cases and encourage suspected offenders to move the Delhi HC,” he added.
 
 
 
 The Delhi high court on Thursday extended the protection from arrest granted to Karti Chidambaram in the INX Media money laundering case from March 20 to 22. “Since no objection has been expressed by the ED for changing the dates, the petition is fixed for hearing on March 22,” the court recorded in its order.
