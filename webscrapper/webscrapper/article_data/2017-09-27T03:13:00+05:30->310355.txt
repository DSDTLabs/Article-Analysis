Nagpur: The 75th foundation day of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) was celebrated in an innovative way as students from schools and colleges across the city were invited to tour various research divisions at Neeri, on Tuesday. 

 On the second day, students also showcased their science projects.
 
 Documentaries on Neeri’s environmental projects were screened for the students. Researchers in the environmental virology cell, environmental impact sustainability (EIS) and air pollution control (APC) divisions explained their work to the curious students.
 
 Researcher at virology cell Gaurav Ghugre explained the students about their research on the virus bacteriophage. He said, “This virus helps in synthesizing special medicine for multi-drug resistant bacteria which infect humans.”
 
 Ghugre informed of a project currently being undertaken along the river Ganga to isolate bacteriophage. He said, “We have found a natural abundance of the viruses in the river. As a result, despite being a polluted river, there are very few bacteria. This is one of the reasons why people believe the Ganga river to be a sacred and healing river because of bacteriophage.”
 
 Dhanashree Mone, another researcher at EIS division educated students about culturing spirulina algae for use as diet protein supplement for humans. 
 
 “This is especially beneficial for children in rural areas where there is an epidemic of malnourishment,” Mone added.
 
 Students then proceeded to the APC division where researcher Pankaj Koware where he demonstrated the apparatus used to measuring particulate matter in the air. 
 
 Students from Centre Point School, Podar World School and JN Tata Parsi Girls High School put their projects on display. 
 
 Children illustrated their ideas on rain water harvesting, air and water pollution and solar energy through working models.
