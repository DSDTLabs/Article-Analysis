CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government will soon adopt the   (Registration and Regulation) Act in the state to regulate the  , on the lines of neighbouring Haryana.

 Health minister   told the Punjab legislative assembly about the proposal on Monday. Mohindra said that he had discussed the matter with chief minister Amarinder Singh and the state government would soon bring in the new law. The issue was raised by leader of opposition in assembly Sukhpal Singh Khaira.
 
 
 The AAP leader alleged that private hospitals in the state were exploiting the patients, often slapping them with hefty bills. “In some cases, these hospitals even charge over and above the MRP. There should be somebody to regulate their services,” he said.
 
 Haryana has already brought in the   (Registration and Regulation) Adoption Bill, 2018, which was passed by the assembly recently. Haryana was prompted to bring in the law after couple of incidents where noted private hospitals were accused of   of rupees from patients’ families.
 
 Earlier, Punjab assembly had discussed the issue on a call to attention notice by Congress MLA Randeep Singh Nabha on March 22. Congress MLA from Mohali Balbir Singh Sidhu had also underlined the need for regulating the charges of private hospitals that had been given land on concessional rates. “There are about a dozen in my constituency Mohali,” he said. AAP’s Sunam MLA Aman Arora had suggested that as the Congress government planning to close down “Sewa Kendras”, the infrastructure could be used for turning these into ‘Mohalla Clinics’ on lines of Delhi.
