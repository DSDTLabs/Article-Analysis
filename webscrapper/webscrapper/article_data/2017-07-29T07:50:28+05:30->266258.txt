PUNE: The traffic around   has become a   for people staying at Bhugaon, Bavdhan and Bhusari because of the steep   connecting it to Paud Road.

 Citizens gathering at the spot where a dumper killed two and injured one on the slope demanded immediate rectification of its gradient.   (PMC) has planned to ease the traffic situation proposing budgetary provision for it. The   standing committee has proposed the first tunnel in the city from Pashan-Panchavati to Kothrud to decongest the area. 
 
 The project plan states the traffic from the NDA, Pashan, Kothrud and Mulshi accumulates at Chandani Chowk junction to disperse in various directions, triggering congestion. “The terrain of the area is hilly. So, the existing road gradients are steep. Due to the increase in traffic, this junction has become an accident-prone area,” states the PMC’s project report.
 
 Till the tunnel becomes a reality, residents of the area would have to live dangerously. Mohan Belgamwar, a resident of Sai Palace along the slope near Lohiya-Jain IT Park, told TOI, “Our society is at the end of the slope. We cannot enter our premises safely because of the heavy traffic coming from Chandni Chowk,” he said.
 
 Rakesh Kadwalkar, an employee of a BPO said the vehicles hurtled down at a high speed because of the slope. “Last year, a truck came crashing down few autorickshaws. Thankfully, no one was injured,” Rakesh said.
 
 According to a plan approved by road transport minister Nitin Gadkari, an underpass, a flyover and a service road at Chandani Chowk would ease the congestion. Gadkari has instructed the NHAI to present the proposed plan to guardian minister Girish Bapat, municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar as well as other experts and start the tendering. The Centre would spend the required amount for the project but the PMC should help in land acquisition, Gadkari recently said.
