MUMBAI: The government’s plan to start a new education board offering international curriculum in Marathi-medium schools has come in for flak from academics, who say it’s an odd idea considering the existing state board cannot even ensure a curriculum and teaching methods that meets national standards. Teachers and former members of the state board have said government should focus on improving the existing system rather than compete on an entirely new platform.

 Speaking at an event on Monday, school education minister   said, “Government has decided to form the   to prepare the syllabus for non-English medium schools. It will compete with the existing boards such as CBSE and ICSE.” The state had issued a government resolution on it some months ago. In the first phase, 13 selected Marathi medium schools are to function according to the new syllabus of an international standard, he said, adding that every district would soon have least one school affiliated to the international board. The new education board will roll out from the next academic session. The new board and the existing state board will coexist, under this plan.
 
 Vasant Kalpande, former chairperson of the state board, called the decision impractical. “Setting up a whole new board for providing international curriculum is impractical. There are ways to work in the same set-up and bring up the quality and improve standards. Enrichment programmes could have been chalked out for select schools on a pilot basis to create model schools. Also, if only 100 schools are being selected, will the other one lakh schools be ignored?” he asked.
 
 Echoing his views, Uday Nare, a teacher and former member of the state’s board division in Mumbai, said, “Infrastructure and quality are lacking in the existing board. It is necessary that the state first look at improving the standards of a board that is catering to lakhs of students every year,” he said.
