PUDUCHERRY: Coming down heavily on the leader of the opposition and AINRC founder-leader N  , chief minister   held the previous   responsible for pushing the Union territory of   into a financial crisis.

 Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Narayanasamy said Rangasamy had been enacting a drama by levelling allegations against the ruling Congress, to cheat the people of Puducherry. He said Rangasamy had no moral right to criticise the functioning of the Congress government in Puducherry and challenged him to an open debate in this regard.
 
 Narayanasamy opined that the administrative mismanagement of the previous AINRC regime had spelt doom for the Union territory. “He (Rangasamy) suffers from amnesia. He was the chief minister for 12 long years. He appointed several employees through the back door in all public sector units, thus causing huge losses to the PSUs. We have formed a committee to probe the issue,” Narayanasamy said.
 
 He alleged that Rangasamy diverted funds from one head to the other to implement unwarranted programmes and projects leading to financial irregularities. The previous government did not disburse old age and widow pensions for more than eight or nine months and also failed to distribute free rice through the fair price shops during its regime, he said, adding that the Congress government had streamlined the financial position and resumed pension disbursement and free rice distribution.
