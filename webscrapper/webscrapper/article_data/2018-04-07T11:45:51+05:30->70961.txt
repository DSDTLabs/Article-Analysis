Director   has pulled off a casting coup of sorts by roping in   to play Venkatesh’s love interest in the upcoming multi-starrer, F2: Fun and Frustration. “This will be the first time Tamannaah and   will be paired together onscreen. Anil was keen on having Tamannaah play the lead and recently met her and narrated the script. It is an absolute laugh riot and Tamannaah liked it a lot and agreed to come on board,” informs a source in the film’s unit adding, “The filmmakers are in the process of finalising details of her remuneration and other formalities. It’s only a matter of time before an official announcement will be made.” 
  Pirzada will be play the other heroine, paired opposite   in the movie slated to hit the floors soon. “The comic quotient will be the highlight of the movie. Varun and Mehreen’s pairing will be one of the highlights of the movie. The two will be seen in hitherto unseen comic avatars,” adds the source. Looks like there is plenty to look forward to in this multi-starrer.
