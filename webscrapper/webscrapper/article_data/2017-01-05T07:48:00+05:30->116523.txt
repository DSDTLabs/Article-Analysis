JALALABAD: Police booked 32 protesting unemployed youths for disrupting traffic on the Ferozepur-Fazilka road near Ladhuwala village under Jalalabad block of Fazilka district on Wednesday.

 The protesters were demanding government jobs and raised anti-government slogans. Three of their associates -- Malkit Singh, Harjinder Singh and   -- have been protesting atop a water tank in Ladhuwala.
 
 The protesting youths’ leader   claimed the local administration had promised them a meeting with deputy chief minister   on January 2 in Lambi town of Mukstar. “When our delegates visited Lambi, Sukhbir reportedly refused to meet them. Following that we sat on a dharna and blocked traffic on Ferozepur-Fazilka road,” he said. The protesters on top of the water tank feel very dejected and could take the extreme step if their demands are not fulfilled, he added.
