HYDERABAD:   on Sunday reacted sharply to TDP MLA  's criticism of finance minister Etala Rajendar. "He was appreciated by no one less than the union finance minister Arun Jaitley himself during the meeting on GST," the TRS leaders said about   to rebutt the criticism by Revanth Reddy. 

 Addressing a press conference, Karimnagar MP B Vinod Kumar, MLCs Karne Prabhakar, and Srinivas Reddy said Etala Rajendar had been striving to get more funds for the state and because of his abilities, chief minister   had given him important portfolios, including the civil supplies portfolio.
 
 The TRS leaders said allegations being levelled against endowments minister A Indrakaran Reddy were baseless. "When a vigilance report was given during the Congress regime, how can the present minister be criticized?" they asked.
 
 "There is no question of the TDP coming to power in Telangana in the 2019 elections. People in the state do not even recognize it as a party anymore," Karimnagar MP Vinod Kumar said. 
 
 Vinod Kumar also said the TRS would have no tie-up with any political party in the next elections.
