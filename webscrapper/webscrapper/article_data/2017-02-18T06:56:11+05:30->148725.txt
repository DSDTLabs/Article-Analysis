TIRUMALA: Call it the effect of demonetisation. Devotees trekking to the seven hills for a darshan of lord Balaji may have to shell out more for tickets and various temple services.

 The Tirumala   Devasthanam is mulling raising the rates for various services after a dip was noted in the daily revenue of the temple post-demonetisation.
 
 According to officials, before demonetisation, TTD's daily income was about Rs 5 crore, including interest on bank deposits. Apart from the `hundi' collections, TTD's coffers are filled by the sale of tickets, `prasad', etc. “After demonetisation, we observed a   on many days. Now, we are looking at bridging the revenue gap wit hout burdening devotees,“ TTD chairman   told TOI.
 
 TTD chairman C Krishnamurthy said they were looking at a small hike in ticket prices at the Tirupati temple to offset the fall in revenue post-demonetisation. The proposal must first be cleared by the state government. Some time ago, TTD had proposed to increase the rates of tickets and `prasad', but it was shot down by AP chief minister N  .
 
 TTD tickets range from Rs 50 to Rs 500. Most devotees buy special darshan tickets for Rs 300. At least 2,000 devotees go for VIP darshan every day , shelling out Rs 500.
 
 “The revenue gap can be bridged with a mild hike in ticket rates or Rs 5 to Rs 10 raise for various seva,“ said officials. In 2011, TTD had hiked the price of prasad of 12 varieties distributed to devotees who participate in seva, but the cost of laddu has remained the same since 2007.
