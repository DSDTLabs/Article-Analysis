The warm ambience of a candlelight dinner envelops all the romantic songs of Anoop Menon’s  . 

 The naughtiness, longingness and heaviness of the emotion are sewed well onto the tracks, composed by M Jayachandran, making their tastes distinct, yet dreamy overall.
 The album starts with Venalum Varshavum, a melody that reminisces the seasons of life and how the various ‘dinners’ of the singer, from time to time, fit into them. The breezy song with a retro touch gives the same vibes as the various videos of the films, which had come out. In parts, it also feels like a church hymn, charmingly sung at the altar of one’s past.
 The vintage musical mood continues with the next song Neela Neela Mizhikalo. Comparing the eyes and words of the lover to moonlight, the soft tune reclines comfortably on the orchestration that’s relatively heavy in parts.
 
 Marayatholi, the third song by Vijay Yesudas is an innocent take on the first stage of romance, which agrees to any terms of the beloved. The soft drum backdrop amps up the imageries of how you compare everything beautiful, to your lover. The next song Kaattil Ee Jalakam is an extension of the previous song, but with a catchier rhythm arrangement.
 The first part of the final song Oru Parvayil is courtesy to the evergreen Hindi song Lag Ja Gale. Delightfully mixed in with soft violin, it’s a light listen on ears, though one can’t help wondering how the obviously borrowed line adds value to the setting.
