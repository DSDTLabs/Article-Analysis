Kolkata: Two Bengal mountaineers — Shaikh Sahabuddin and Kuntal Karar — were flown to Kathmandu two days after they scaled Mount   on Sunday. 

 Both the families are praying for the speedy recovery of Karar, whose tryst with the mountain left him with frostbite.
 
 Karar, however, has assured his family that he is well and would be back soon. Sahabuddin, who lives in Ishapore and works at the Metal & Steel Factory, has become a hero among his colleagues. 
 
 “Having scaled many mountains, my husband has always been a hero. But after scaling Everest, he has become a hero in his office. His colleagues and bosses have already reached Kathmandu to congratulate him,” said Sahabuddin’s wife Ruksana, who hails from Kashmir.
 
 Sahabuddin’s brother Salauddin said that two months before the expedition, the mountaineer underwent a surgery. Yet, nothing could stop him from scaling the Everest. 
 
 His family has been told that Sahabuddin is perhaps the first Indian Muslim mountaineer to have scaled the Everest. 
 
 The excitement, however, died down on Monday evening after Karar’s family learned about his frostbite. “We couldn’t sleep on Monday. We were planning to raise funds to reach Kathamandu, but he called around 8.30am on Tuesday and informed us about his health. He also sent us photos from the hospital,” said Karar’s sister-in-law Mamomi from their Howrah residence.
 
 Mountaineering has been an addiction for Karar. After completing his diploma engineering, he took up a job but later started his own business.
 
 At present, the family is waiting for Karar’s safe return. The family members said his grandmother passed away when Karar was on this expedition and they had plans to share the news once he returned.
