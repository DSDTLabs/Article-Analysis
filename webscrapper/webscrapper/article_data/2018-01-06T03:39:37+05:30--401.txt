NEW DELHI: The   sought the Centre’s response on a petition filed by the   assailing the central guidelines reducing the quota for state panels from 75% to 70% of the pilgrims cleared for annual pilgrimage to Mecca. 

 The committee, through advocate Haris Beeran, complained that the SC had in 2012 approved the Central Haj Policy which allotted 75% of pilgrims to be facilitated for travel by state committees and 25% by private tour operators.   said state panels charge a reasonable Rs 2 lakh for travel and stay in Saudi Arabia, compared to around Rs 4 lakh charged by private operators. 
 
 The state said as many as 4.48 lakh pilgrims have applied to go for the Haj pilgrimage this year, but the reduced state quota could accommodate only 1.23 lakh. This arbitrary and unreasonable reduction of quota to state committees has exposed many pilgrims to exploitation by private operators, it said. 
 
 A bench led by Chief Justice Dipak Misra declined request for a stay on the central guidelines, but ordered the Centre to respond to the allegations by January 30, the next date of hearing.
 
 Themove evoked sharp political responses.   spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary termed it blatant misuse of power. “Vikas karne se rang badalta hai... rang badalne se vikas nahi hota (development leads to change of colour not vice-versa),” he said. 
 
 Congress’s Ammar Rizvi said this was “sycophancy of the highest order” from Haj Committee officials. “They just want to please their political masters,” he said. Haj committee secretary R P Singh said the idea was to paint the building in accordance with other government buildings in the vicinity. 
 
 “It appears that an overzealous worker painted the wall with saffron colour,” he said, adding that the building will remain white. UP estate officer Yogesh Shukla confirmed the department was not consulted for painting the wall.
