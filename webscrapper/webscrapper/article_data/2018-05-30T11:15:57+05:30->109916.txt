CHANDIGARH: Palwal police on Tuesday booked Hathin   Kehar Singh Rawat of the INLD and his bodyguard for allegedly thrashing an employee of the public health department last week. Rawat and his personal security officer Ved Parkash were booked in a case of assault, obstructing a government official in the discharge of his duty and assaulting a government servant on duty at Bahin police station.

 Bahin SHO inspector Krishan Kant said investigations were in progress and no arrests had been made so far. “We are verifying the facts and awaiting the medico-legal report (MLR) to proceed further in the matter,” he said.
 
 Though the MLA could not be reached for comments, his party termed the registration of the case as an act of vendetta against the opposition. “An MLA is the public representative and always takes up public issues. Water shortage is a main problem there and he had just raised the voice for that. So far as the case is concerned, this government can go up to any extent to suppress our voice,” said INLD general secretary R S Chaudhary.
 
 According to information, the incident occurred on May 21 afternoon when Abhay Singh, a motorman, and three other workers of the public health department were checking the water line of Nangal Jat village near Pehraya turn under Hathin block. Kehar, who was accompanied by his gunmen and supporters, reached there and started abusing the officials. In his complaint to the SDO, who later formally lodged it, Abhay said while thrashing the officials, Kehar was repeatedly saying, “It is matter of few months. We shall see everybody after our party comes to power.”
 
 Cops said after assaulting the public health department workers, the MLA and his associates left the place. The injured officials were rushed to the hospital, where they were medically examined.
