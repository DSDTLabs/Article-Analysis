CHENNAI: Six days after the city police said they had arrested 76 wanted men in an early morning raid last at a truck stop off   near   at a   party for  , the Choolaimedu-based criminal named in at least three murders surrendered to the   police on Tuesday.

 Binu, photographed at the party cutting a cake with a chopper, told police after turning himself in that he was 50 years old and ailing, a police source said, playing down the significance of the surrender by saying the repeat offender was “anything but a gangster”.
 
 “I am not a big rowdy... it’s just hype by police and the media,”   said in a videotaped “confession” that police sources leaked to the media in a surprising twist, given that police officers had, after ‘Operation Birthday’ on February 7, touted him as a major underworld leader.
 
 Binu escaped from police teams raiding the party venue, Velu Lorry Shed, and had since been in hiding.
 
 “I have diabetes,” Binu said in the video. “Due to bad friends, I got involved in [criminal] cases. I wanted to reform... and stayed in   for three years.”
 
 The trouble started after his brother requested that he come to Chennai on his 50th birthday, he said.
 
 “I was surprised to find a big party awaiting me,” Binu said. “Then I learned that [my brother] had invited many of my old partners in crime. I was worried... but my brother told me to leave the venue after cutting the cake.”
 
 “Police were chasing me and I couldn’t stay in hiding,” he said. “Please forgive me.”
