NEW DELHI: The science & technology ministry on Monday launched a low-cost indigenously developed   screening device for newborns called Sohum to cater to nearly 26 million babies born every year in India. This device, which allows screening without requiring babies to be sedated, once available across the country can help minimise hearing impairment or even reverse the damage.

 The battery-operated noninvasive Sohum uses brainstem auditory evoked response technology, which is recommended as best screening choice by the American Association of Pediatrics and the National Health Services of UK. At present, most of the hospital-born babies cannot be tested in the absence of any cost-effective device.
 
 Globally eight lakh hearing impaired babies are born annually of which nearly one lakh are born in India. “Sohum is a perfect product to be given to the   across the country. Local manufacture of such products is crucial to further bring down costs,” said Y S Chowdary, minister of state for science and technology, after launching the device, which is developed by School of International Biodesign (SIB) startup Sohum Innovation Labs India Pvt Ltd.
 
 “Congenital hearing loss is a result of both genetic and non-genetic factors. These factors are mostly associated with resource-poor countries such as India where... hearing impairment goes undiagnosed.
 
 Thus, when it is discovered at the age of four plus, it’s too late to reverse the damage and this leads to... problems such as impaired communication skills and even possible mental illness,” said a science & technology ministry note. “The Sohum team has come up with a screening device to facilitate the routine screening of newborn babies,” said the ministry while noting that the device has already been installed in five clinical centers which are currently running the screening programme. “The aim is to screen two percent of hospital-born babies in the first year,” said the ministry.
