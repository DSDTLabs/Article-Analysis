KOLKATA: Is ATK’s marquee player   returning to English football?

 According to reports published in the British media on Thursday, his first club Wolverhampton Wanderers FC are planning to get him back on board. In fact, Wolves - currently playing in the Championship (England’s second division) - want to get his signature in the current transfer window (Jan. 1 to 31) itself.
 
 Keane joined   for   4 after ending his stint with LA Galaxy. However, the former Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United striker is understood to be eligible to secure an early release from the defending ISL champions.
 
 Keane made his professional debut for Wolves in 1997 before moving to Coventry for £6 million two years later. He went on to play for  , Leeds, Liverpool and Celtic, among other clubs. ATK are managed by former England striker Teddy Sheringham, who also played with Keane at Tottenham.
 
 Keane - who is fully fit now - has been instrumental in putting ATK on a path of recovery following the city-based franchise’s winless run in the first four matches. 
 
 He suffered an injury during the team’s pre-season training in Dubai and had to return home, thus missing the team’s first couple of matches in ISL 4. However, his return to fitness and, subsequently, to action in ATK jersey made an immediate impact, helping his team win two of their last three matches. He also scored for ATK - his second in the league - in the 1-1 draw against FC Goa on Wednesday.
 
 Asked about Keane’s possible move to English football, an ATK official said: “We are not aware of this.”
