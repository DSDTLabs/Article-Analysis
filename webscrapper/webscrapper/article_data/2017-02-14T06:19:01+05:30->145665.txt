COIMBATORE: Ajith Kumar, a second year engineering student and a resident of the   for the past decade, remembers running down to play cricket at the corporation playground, almost every evening since the age of 10. However, for the past five months, the boy and his friends have been able to play the sport only on a small stretch of land in the playground. This has been the case of nearly 100 children and youngsters in the unit, who have been been using the ground for many years. 

 The playground located behind the Singanallur Uzhavar Sandhai and opposite the Singanallur bus stand, spans around 3,500 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft. Half of the ground has now been occupied by private luxury buses, that arrive at the bus stand.
 
 "Six months ago, we saw buses being parked in the ground, occupying a quarter of it. Then a few months later, the   started dumping electric boxes, transformers and street light parts in the ground," said T Thangavel, a diploma student who regularly plays badminton in the ground.
 
 As a result, hardly 25% of the ground is left for play. "We only have volleyball and a hand ball court that is remaining and we now use it to play cricket and badminton in that space," said  , another resident of Singanallur Housing Unit. "Since many of us are forced to share the small space, none can play any sport properly due to the long waiting hours," he added.
 
 The students complained that they were not able to continue playing after dark due to the lack of street lights in the area. "We cannot play after dark, as there are no street lights and we are not able to see the ball or a shuttle cork," said Thangavel.
