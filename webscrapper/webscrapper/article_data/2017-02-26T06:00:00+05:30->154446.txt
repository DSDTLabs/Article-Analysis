 and Sai Dharam Tej’s friendship goes way back. However, despite the comfort they share as friends, the two actors haven’t been paired in a film, until  . So, when they did get a chance to work together, the duo admits that they both had a ball. 
“We both were like kids in a candy shop,” quips  , as Rakul adds, “People on the sets were awe-stuck by the friendship we shared. It must have also been a bit frustrating for them, because we would talk nonsense all the time and these were things that only we both understood. It was a big mystery for the rest of the team. (laughs).”
 What’s more, the two even ganged up together to unleash a series of pranks targetted at everyone else on the sets. “We loved playing pranks on everyone else on the team. There was this one particular incident when we were shooting a song and Sai came up to me and said, ‘When the director says action, we’ll do our own dance step’. And when we did that the response was hilarious, everybody was like: ‘This step is not even remotely close to the choreography! What are these guys doing?’ It was so funny,” says Rakul, who plays an athlete in the film. 
 While Rakul recalls Sai Dharam Tej as one among the first few friends she made when she entered the T’town, the actor is quick to pitch in: “Now after the film, there’s a deeper connection between the two of us, no?”
 With that much history as friends, we wondered if it was awkward when it came to romance and chemistry for the roles. “It wasn’t awkward at all, we were very comfortable,” answers Sai Dharam, as Rakul adds, “It was also helpful that we did not have that many romantic scenes. In most part of the film, you’ll see me scolding him, so that was easy! (laughs).” 
 As much as it was a fun ride, the actors are now hoping for the best at the box office. “We hope people like the film and pray that more and more people come to watch it. This will only encourage us to do more quality work,” says Sai Dharam, on a parting note.
