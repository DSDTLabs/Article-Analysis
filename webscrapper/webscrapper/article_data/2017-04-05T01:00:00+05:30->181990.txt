A minor tiff over a make-up artiste has created major problems between ' ' actors   and  . We hear, the once best friends can’t see eye to eye anymore. Not just that, even her other co-actor   isn’t too pleased with the actress. 
Reveals an eyewitness about the incident, “Vikkas agreed to share his make-up artiste with Niti as she wasn’t too happy with hers. However, when Vikkas requested the make-up man to attend to him first, as his was the first scene to be shot, Niti took offence. She stormed out of the set, stalling the shoot. It was only after the producer intervened that she resumed shooting.”
 However, Niti claims, “I didn’t stall the shoot, somebody else did, and I don’t intend to reveal that person’s name. There were two units on the said day and one of them was scheduled to shoot me first. Yes, I was upset because I too needed a make-up guy, but everything is fine between my co-actors and me,” she says.
 Vikkas has a different story altogether. “Whatever happened shouldn’t have happened. There was no need to complicate things. I initiated a conversation with her the next day as I didn’t want the quality of the show to suffer. She apologised to me and also decided to render an apology to the producers,” he claims. 
 Param, however, was evasive about the topic. “It happened between them so I don’t wish to comment on it,” he sums up.
