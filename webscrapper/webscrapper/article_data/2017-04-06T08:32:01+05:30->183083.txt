  : The state government appears to have decided to reopen the   to nail the real culprits following demands to ensure that justice is done to the family in the wake of the High Court acquitting Satyam Babu, 

 Top sources said once DGP N Sambasiva Rao is back from his Israel trip on April 10, the government will take a decision on reopening the case after consulting the advocate-general and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. "More than 3,000 students from various colleges took part in rallies and protests across the city demanding justice. We have been telling the cops that Satyam Babu was innocent and the investigation had several loopholes," water resources minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao told TOI. "This is a special case and the High Court has given its verdict. Now, it's our responsibility to bring the real culprits to the court of law," the minister said. Dropping enough hints that the case would be reopened soon, the minister said the government is keenly watching the case. "The CM is seized of the matter and will soon take a call on reopening the case and ensure justice to the aggrieved family," he asserted. 
 
 Recalling that the TDP was the only party to have fought against then   government for 'shielding' the culprits, Uma said the TDP government will not let the family down. 
 
 "We stick to the assurance given to Ayesha Meera's mother Shamshad Begum when she had come to us after her daughter was murdered in 2007. We intend to order a fresh probe after talking to police top brass on the investigation done so far," he explained. In-charge DGP Harish Kumar Guptha said that police were not in a hurry to comment on the verdict as they are still studying the judgment copy before approaching the Supreme Court.
