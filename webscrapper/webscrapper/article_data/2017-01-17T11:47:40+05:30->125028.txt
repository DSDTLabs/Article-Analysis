LUCKNOW: Critical care patients at   may avail the air ambulance facility in the near futures. The university plans to build two helipads in the physiology ground opposite the administration block. 

 Once helipads are ready, then KGMU will become the first medical institute in the state to provide air ambulance facility to its patients. The facility will also be used for transportation of organs for transplant. 
 
 The site plan proposes a 50 metre by 50 metre   stretch in the place where the open air stage currently exists. Further, there will be a provision for emergency landing of army helicopters in case of a bigger emergency, where more than one person can be transported to and from KGMU. 
 
 “The plan is now in its final stages and nirman nigam will begin the construction shortly. When we are aiming to make KGMU an international level  , there was a definite need for an air transit service and have the coordinates on the aviation map,” said project in charge  . 
 
 He said a team from the state civil aviation department had done a site inspection in November. A final proposal was sent to the directorate general of civil aviation in December to get the helipads on their route map, maring them available for emergency landings. “Their team is also expected to visit the site soon,” he said. 
 
 Initially, air ambulance will be provided by private companies.
