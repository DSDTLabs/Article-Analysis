Indore:   Juneja, 21, who single-handedly started his business just six months back was in tears after the fire incident on Saturday.

 Locals and family members were present at the spot and were seen consoling Gourav.
 
 “The fire had started early in the morning on the third floor and as soon as I opened the shutter around 10:15 am, it spread to the other floors,” said Gourav told TOI.
 
 Gourav, drenched in water, supervised the entire operation since morning and helped fire officials, but by evening he was in no condition to speak to anyone.
 
 “My nephew had taken loans from different people and started the business just six months ago. He was interested in working in this market and had done a lot of research before starting the decorations shop,” said Praveen Chabbra, Gourav’s uncle.
 
 He added that everyone was shocked by the incident but were relieved that it was not the same as the previous incident in which seven people were killed. “We are lucky no one was hurt but my nephew has suffered huge losses,” said Chabbra.
 
 Gourav’s mother is a housewife and his father works in a private company, claimed family members.
