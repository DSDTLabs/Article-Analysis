KOLKATA: Nine Kolkata   came together on the lawns of the   here for people to sample some of the delicacies that will be served during the much-hyped  ,   March 21 onwards.

 The unique taste-off to celebrate French cuisine was inaugurated by Damien Syed, French consul-general in Kolkata. The annual spring event, kicked off since 2015, seems to have brought France closer to Kolkata.
 
 The press-conference which gave the media some inkling about this year’s French gastronomy celebration was organised by Syed himself. He welcomed the guests to “the one of its kind – tasting session,” while giving everyone a low-down on the French passion for food.
 
 All the teams from each and every participating hotel in Kolkata came with a single pre-prepared “tasting” dish which was their signature platter for the big day. “The idea is to introduce to the media what the whole event is all about, physically, with a taste of things to come. The media sampled some exquisite French dishes during this interactive session with the chefs and hotel managers who were part of this chapter of Goût de France and find this unique opportunity to write about it,” said Syed.
 
 Around 150 countries from all over the world, restaurants and embassies will offer 1,500 dinners to celebrate France’s gastronomy by inviting the public to dine in French style, paying tribute to a vibrant, open and innovative cuisine.
 
 Inspired by Auguste Escoffier, who launched the “Dîners d’Épicure” (Epicurean Dinners) initiative – the same menu, the same day, in several world cities and aimed at as many diners as possible – in 1912, Goût de France/Good France reproduces that beautiful idea with the desire to involve restaurants all around the world.
 
 Each chef offered a “French-style” menu in their restaurant with a traditional French aperitif, a cold starter, a hot starter, fish or shellfish, meat or poultry, a French cheese (or cheeseboard), a chocolate dessert, French wines and digestifs, while remaining free to highlight their own culinary traditions and cultures.
 
  
  
 Eateries around the world – from haute cuisine restaurants to bistros – are being encouraged to apply on the goodfrance.com website, proposing a menu that showcases France’s culinary traditions.
