PANAJI: Opposition leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’  , who was expected to appear before the anti-corruption branch ( ) of the directorate of vigilance on Monday, in connection with the Rs 4.78 crore disproportionate assets case, skipped the summons issued to him late last week. He has now sought time till March 21 to appear before the branch. 

 A senior ACB officer said Kavlekar, in his letter, stated that it was his constitutional duty to attend the upcoming legislative assembly session and as such, sought time till March 21 to appear before the branch. 
 
 “Kavlekar has expressed his inability to be present at the branch and has sought more than a month’s time to appear before the ACB. We will issue a fresh summons to him in due course,” ACB superintendent of police (SP)  , told TOI.
 
 Land owners from Kerala and Goa who sold properties to Kavlekar, have also been summoned by the ACB in the case. The branch had issued 15 summons to land owners from both, Kerala and Goa, to appear before it from February 15 onwards, in a bid to verify whether the properties were purchased from legal sources of income.
 
 On September 15, last year, the ACB registered a first information report (FIR) in the disproportionate assets case under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988. It had also booked Kavlekar’s wife,  , in the case under Section 109 (abetment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as she was found to be a director of his companies.
 
 The ACB had subsequently conducted searches at Kavlekar’s residence at Quepem as well as at his office and commercial spaces at Quepem and Margao, respectively.
