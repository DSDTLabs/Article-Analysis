Mysuru: Delighted over the government’s decision to hike their salary and other facilities,   are now on a mission to clinch the city’ Cleanest City tag for the third consecutive year. They are voluntarily working nearly 12 hours a day to maintain maximum cleanliness in the city. 

 CP Rajeev, joint secretary,   Nagara Palike Pourakarmikara Sangha, said “For the past two months, we have been giving our best to keep the city neat and clean. However, public participation is necessary and they should be responsible while disposing waste. Instead of throwing garbage at public places, they should be handed over to the pourakarmikas, who come at their doorsteps. If the people come across any civic issues, they should alert us using the newly launched Swachhata-MoUD app.”
 
 He added that it is the dream of all pourakarmikas to win the coveted title once again and thanked the government for providing all the facilities .
 
 MK Mahadev, joint secretary of the vedike, said, “We have been conducting personality development for pourakarmikas for the past two months, so as to ease communication between them and the public.” 
 
 He added that the present corporation commissioner Jagadeesh and DC Randeep are helpful to them and attends to their problems quickly. 
 
 In  , around 2,600 pourakarmikas, including 650 permanent staff, work round the clock to keep the city neat. 
 
 A few officials from Delhi have already arrived in the city to merit Mysuru’s cleanliness quotient.
