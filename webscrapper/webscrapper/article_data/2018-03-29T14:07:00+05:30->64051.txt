BHARUCH/SURAT: The historical   on   will be closed for a month for all vehicles except two-wheelers beginning Thursday. 

 The closure notification has been issued by the district collector in view of the construction of new   bridge adjoining the Golden Bridge. “The decision is taken for a speedy and smooth work of the bridge that is under construction. No vehicles except wheelers will be allowed to travel from March 29 to April 29, 2018,” the notification states. 
 
 Around 10,000 vehicles including 400 auto rickshaws, 4,000 four-wheelers and other small tempos will now have to use the new cable-stayed bridge on NH8. 
 
 This is for the first time that the bridge will be closed for a month since it was built in 1881. It was only during heavy floods in 2013 Narmada river that the bridge was closed for five days as a safety measure. 
 
 Jivraj Patel, president of  , said, “It will be difficult for more than a lakh daily commuters between Bharuch and Ankleshwar as they have to travel an additional 30km which will take at least 30 minutes. The administration needs to ensure there is no traffic jam at toll plaza at   village on NH8 near the cable-stayed bridge.”
 
 Jai Bharat Auto Rickshaw Association also protested against the decision and demanded that rickshaws be allowed to operate on the bridge. 
 
 On Wednesday, there was severe traffic jam for nearly an hour at the Golden Bridge due to the protests.
