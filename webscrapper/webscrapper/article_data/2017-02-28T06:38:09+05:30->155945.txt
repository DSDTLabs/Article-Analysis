 Executive engineer, Tenughat Dam Division, AK Jha said, "We are conducting repair work at four points while the BSL team is doing the same at seven different points in the canal".
 
 Before beginning the repairing work, the BSL management stored sufficient water in its Cooling pond to avoid any form of restriction on the water supply to the various households. Production at the slabbing mill and steel melting ship (SMS)-I in the BSL plant has been stopped to reduce water consumption.
 
 The BSL management has also shut down one of the three water pumps, through which water is supplied in different units, across the plant. This will further help reduce the water consumption in the plant. Meanwhile, each of the units across the plant has been directed to control their water consumption level to avoid any other crisis.
 
 Following the huge water crisis in November last year, the BSL management and its parent company Steel Authourity of India Limited (SAIL) have grown serious about repairing the Tenughat canal.. The incident had a huge impact on BSL production as well as residents living in the region.
 
 It took the BSL authorities over two months to resume water supply in the township and to the plant. 
 
 The BSL has now formed a committee to monitor canal. The committee and Tenughat Dam Division authorities assessed the crucial points and decided to stop the water supply from February 27 to March 3.
