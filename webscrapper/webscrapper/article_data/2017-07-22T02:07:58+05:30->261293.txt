NEW DELHI: It was babies’ day out at Malviya   police station on Friday. A group of 20 curious children, visiting along with their teachers, went around the entire police station singing nursery rhymes they had recently learnt at their playschool for the cops.

 It all began when a kid questioned his teacher, “Police kya hota hai? (What is police?)” His teacher approached a beat policeman in her area, who informed SHO Satinder Sangwan about it. The teachers and students were then invited over to see who really is a policeman and what do they do. The children, aged between two and four, were allowed to go everywhere at the police station. “They hopped from one room to another, making friends and telling the cops about what they do at school,” said a teacher accompanying the students.
 
 A police officer said that the four-year-olds were the most curious of the lot. “Children at a young age are told that policemen are scary and that they should always be cautious of them. Today they saw a different side. Most of them didn’t want to leave,” the cop said.
 
 A senior officer said that this was a unique exercise and that they would repeat it soon, next time with children from the slums.
 
 DCP-I (south) Chinmoy Biswal tweeted about the incident after which the cops claimed to have received requests from several other schools. All of them wanted to visit the police station with students to give them exposure. While leaving, all children were handed a basket of goodies, which they happily grabbed and fought for more. “This was a great experience. Before we could return to the school, the children started to ask us when they would be going back to the police station,” said a teacher.
