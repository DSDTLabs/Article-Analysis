MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday batted for removing vehicles parked during business hours in market areas of south Mumbai, including Crawford Market, Kalbadevi and  , to decongest them. 

 Hearing a public interest litigation on traffic congestion, a bench of Justice Naresh   and Justice   said the traffic police need to remove cars and other vehicles parked during "market hours between 8 am and 9 pm". They suggested that the police "try this exercise for 2-3 days".
 
 "You have to convince the residents. It is for their safety. If you are successful in convincing them for one day, others will follow," said Justice Patil. The judges said entry to big trucks to the markets should be stopped and unloading should be done in small tempos before 8 am. 
 
 The judges said in emergencies like a fire or building collapse such areas will be chaotic. Noting that there is no place for pedestrians to walk, they compared the situation to a local train "where if you stand in the middle you get pushed to one side in some corner". The bench also said that there must be either multi-level or underground parking and the help of home guards and private agencies can be taken to regulate traffic, especially near hospitals and religious place. 
 
 Welcoming the suggestions made by the court, government pleader Poornima Kantharia said the police were trying to regulate traffic. 
 
 She said that  , which even saw bomb blasts, was also once congested but after removal of vehicles there is "impact to a very great extent". 
 
 The joint commissioner of police (traffic) has been directed to take the help of experts to bring out a blueprint aimed at improving the traffic situation.
