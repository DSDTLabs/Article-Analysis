 That’s not all.
 
 After taking into account data of all police stations, it was found that 68% snatching cases have reported at police stations in southern sectors. Thirteen cases have been reported at the Sector 36 police station, eight at Maloya police station, four at Mauli Jagran police station, and three at Sector 49 police station.

Eight cases each have been reported at Sector 17 and Sector 19 police stations.
 
 Police have arrested many snatchers, but the problem is that snatchers easily get bail and start snatchings after coming out of jail.
 
 A police official said there were many gangs active in the city who committed snatchings. “Snatching is the easiest crime. We cannot depute cops on each and every corner. People should be careful,” said a police official.
 
 When contacted, SSP Nilambari Vijay Jagdale said the crime branch had been told to gather information about people accused of snatching earlier. “We have intensified patrolling at vulnerable spots in the city,” she said.
