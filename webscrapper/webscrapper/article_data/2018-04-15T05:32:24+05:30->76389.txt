  A procession led by Dalit Utthan Sangharsh Mahasabha, in which hundreds of supporters of Dr B R Ambedkar participated, started from   at around 10am and arrived at the memorial via   flyover in noon. Participants gathered on the flyover holding pictures of Ambedkar and walked towards the memorial, raising slogans of " ".
