NEW DELHI: The meeting of   allies saw   chief   face strong criticism from another NDA ally for repeatedly lashing out at the Centre. 

 LJP chief   criticised Thackeray and his party for speaking against the government openly despite being a partner in the alliance.
 
 Sources said Paswan pointed out that while there is nothing wrong in being highly critical of any policy, it was improper to keep constantly criticising the alliance, which is in power.
 
 Meanwhile, signalling a thaw in the frosty ties with BJP, Thackeray termed PM   an “elder brother”.
