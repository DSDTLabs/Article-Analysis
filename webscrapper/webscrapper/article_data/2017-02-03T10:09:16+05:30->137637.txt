NAGPUR: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari continues to be stronger than chief minister   as far as making decisions related to city BJP is concerned.

 Gadkari reportedly bargained with CM for a couple of candidates in the latter’s South-West constituency.
 
 Both Fadnavis and Gadkari are members of the BJP city parliamentary board. Even as the party’s city unit has its office near Gandhisagar lake, the parliamentary board met at Gadkari’s house in Mahal. CM arrived at Gadkari’s residence around 10am on Thursday and spent hours to finalize candidates for NMC elections.
 
 BJP sources told TOI that Gadkari and Fadnavis finalized only 97 of the total 151 seats, while the remaining will be okayed by Gadkari.
 
 It is learnt that Gadkari suggested Fadnavis to give ticket to  , who lost in 2012 NMC elections. “Dilip is the younger brother of Purti group’s managing director Sudhir, who is very close to Gadkari. Dilip was defeated by Congress city president Vikas Thakre in the last election,” sources said.
 
 “Dilip lives in Yashodara Nagar in ward no. 38. Again, Thakre or Congress bigwig   will contest from the ward. Hence, Dilip is seeking ticket from ward np. 36 that is said to be safer for BJP and falls in the CM’s constituency. Fadnavis suggested Diwe should contest from ward no. 37. He knew party workers will get upset if Diwe is given ticket from ward no. 36 or 37, but had to compromise,” sources added.
 
 A senior BJP leader said that Fadnavis always avoids confrontation with Gadkari and also appreciates the latter’s decision.
 
 Hence, the question of who is more stronger does not arise, he said.
