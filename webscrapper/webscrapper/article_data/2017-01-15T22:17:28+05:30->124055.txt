NEW DELHI: Former   president and outgoing   ( ) chief N   will be meeting the district secretaries on Monday amidst speculations about who would take over from the Chennai strongman as the supremo of the state unit.

 As per Supreme Court's January 2 and 3 verdict, Srinivasan is no longer eligible to carry on as the president of the TNCA but is likely to meet his loyalists in districts association "informally" and may be one last time.
 
 Sources in TNCA denied the news that the meeting had anything to do with a breakaway national cricket body being formed. Even some of the Srinivisan loyalists from other states were unaware that such an event was happening.
 
 "Nothing of that sort is happening as of now. Every year, the president meets the district secretaries personally but this year it has not been possible till now. But tomorrow's meeting at a five-star facility is strictly an informal one," a TNCA source said on Sunday.
 
 As Srinivasan will be forced to leave office as per   reforms, there is speculation about who will replace Srinivasan in the TNCA top seat.
 
 The man who is now running the show joint secretary   will be forced to go into compulsory 'Cooling off' in another six months.
 
 With Srinivasan confidant   also ending his administrative career, it will be interesting as to which loyalist of the former BCCI chief takes over.
 
 "One thing is for certain, it will not be someone from his family. But India Cements is a big empire and there are a lot of influential corporates who have been associated with the   (CSK) team during the past few years. If you find at least any one such man resigning from India Cements and taking over, won't be surprising. Srinivasan still commands maximum votes and it will be his man at the TNCA helm," concluded the source.
