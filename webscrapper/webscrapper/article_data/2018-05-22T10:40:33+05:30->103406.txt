Indore:   area witnessed tense moments on Monday when   by over six families forced   ( ) to give up the move to tear down a decades old dilapidated three-storey building. 

 The families living in the building protested against the IMC and demanded more time to vacate their houses. They alleged that the civic body had not given proper time to them to vacate the building. 
 
 IMC has postponed demolition drive for next two days. “Following the protest and an appeal made by the residents, we have granted next two days to them to vacate the building. The action of removing the old structure will be carried out on Thursday,” IMC removal officer MS Chouhan told TOI.
 
 IMC has prepared a list of dilapidated buildings, which are posing threat to lives, for demolition. In this series, the removal team had reached Nandlalpura to demolish the decrepit building 
 
 Later, the team removed some portion of three houses erected alongside Kanh river in   to pave way for developing a retaining wall.
 
 “IMC will launch a major drive to remove 150 encroachments in Bhuri Tekari on Tuesday morning. A team of 150 IMC staff with four earth movers will be pressed into service,” Chouhan said.
 
 Notices to occupants have already been served to vacate the spot, he added.
 
 Taking lessons from a recent incident of stone pelting by encroacher in Bhuri Tekari, the officials concerned have already sought support from police and administrative officials for the drive.
