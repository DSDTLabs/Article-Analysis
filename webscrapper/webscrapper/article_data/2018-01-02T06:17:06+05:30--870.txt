AHMEDABAD: The   Board is going to hand over the task of conducting practical tests for   to concerned schools this year.

 Earlier, the tests used to be  , but the board had taken over the task of organizing practical tests itself.
 
 Since the board feels overburdened to organize practical exams, it has decided to pass on the responsibility to schools once again. The issue that the board faces is that all schools offering science education do not have laboratories equipped with apparatus and chemicals. Hence, board officials are to conduct inspection in schools to ascertain that the facility is adequately available.
 
 The board will prepare a schedule and send it to the schools. Accordingly, the schools will have to conduct tests and send marks to the board before the final exams begin.
