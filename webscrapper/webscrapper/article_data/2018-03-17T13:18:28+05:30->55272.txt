CHENNAI: As observers keenly watch the yet-to-unfold politics of actors   and  , the latter on Friday admitted there was bound to be a “divide” between him and his film industry “competitor”-turned political opponent.

  
  
 “I do not yet know his political views. But, (my stand is that) I won’t take sides. I have no religion. I believe in all religions, I believe in amity,”   told TOI on Friday, in what seemed a mild dig at Rajinikanth and his avowed ‘spiritual politics’.
 
 Would there be a sense of regret in the coming days as politics was bound to divide? “Absolutely it will… even our profession did,” said Kamal. “Rajnikanth’s kind of movies are different. I don’t believe in those kind of films because I don’t want to do his kind of films.
 
 Likewise, he wouldn’t want to do the kind of films I am doing. I am sure politics may also have a similar divide. That doesn’t mean, I have to condemn him to disappearance,” said Kamal.
