LUCKNOW:   chief Mayawati’s decision to expel   from her party might mark the end of her overt   after her party’s humiliating defeat in the recent UP assembly elections. Political experts said the development might also be a signal of Mayawati’s return to her core ‘Bahujan’ plank even as she prepares herself for an alliance with the Congress and SP to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

  had reportedly been considering strong action against Siddiqui for his apparent failure in mobilising Muslim voters in favour of BSP, specially in communally sensitive west UP, where she had given the maximum number of tickets to Muslim candidates.
 
 The first sign of Siddiqui coming in the cross-hairs of Mayawati appeared this year on Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14. During a rally in Lucknow, the BSP boss openly held Siddiqui responsible for alleged anomalies in the sale of sugar mills during her previous regime. Mayawati did not stop here, she went on to say that she would “not allow UP to become a Pakistan”.
 
 Sources said Mayawati’s decision was driven by protest by BSP workers, especially the Dalit cadre, which has been accusing Siddiqui of selling party tickets to rich candidates while ignoring the winnable ones. Last month, Mayawati had shunted Siddiqui out of UP to look after party affairs in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 The BSP boss has since been focusing on consolidation of   and Most Backward Castes. 
 
 “She focused too much on Muslims who came from more socially and economically influential backgrounds. That did not go well with the backward Muslims,” said political commentator and Dalit ideologue SR Darapuri.
