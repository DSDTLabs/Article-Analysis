JODHPUR: BJP   from Alwar, Gyan Dev Ahuja, has had no competition when it comes to making foot-in-the-mouth statements. Apparently, he now has competition from another MLA of the saffron brigade—Arjun Lal Garg of Bilara. Addressing a gathering of Dewasi community on Wednesday, the MLA had some sage advice for community members: “Stop peddling drugs. It’s a non-bailable offence. Instead, smuggle gold for which you can easily obtain bail.”

 
 Predictably, the video addressing the gathering went viral and clearly showed him giving this suggestion to the community. Garg’s advice follows the answer he received for a question raised in the assembly on the number of prisoners cooling their heels in Jodhpur jail for crimes under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic (NDPS) Act. He, however,could not be contacted for comments. Sources said that he had left for Ladakh on a leisure tour.
 
 
 
 
 While his speech did begin benignly by asking the younger generation to stay away from drugs, it went into unchartered territory when he spoke about prisoners in Jodhpur jail accused under NDPS Act.
 
 “Let me tell you that the Dewasi community has broken the record of Bishnois in drug peddling,” he says in the video, later advising people to do gold business as bails were easily granted. “If you want to do some illegal business, then go for gold smuggling. Prices of both are the same but it is safer to do gold business than deal with drugs,” he says. He can also be seen asking senior members of the community to take a pledge against drug business and promising the community’s support for gold business. To make his point, he adds that it’s a “matter of pride if someone from the community is caught with gold instead of drugs”.
 
 
  
 
 The speech was made by the MLA during the consecration ceremony of a temple in Jaitawas village in Biara on May 7. The meeting was attended by religious personalities, gurus, public representatives and eminent people, among others.
