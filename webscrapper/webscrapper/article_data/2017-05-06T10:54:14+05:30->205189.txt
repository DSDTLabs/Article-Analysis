CHANDIGARH:   could have come down had the   managed to plug transmission and distribution (T&D) losses of Rs 40 crore in three years, drawing criticism from the Joint   Commission (JERC) for not taking  . 

 The amount, experts say , would have helped in strengthening the infrastructure and in return leading to   of power and fewer power outages.
 
 The commission, in an order dated April 28, 2016, asked the department to instal interface meters on all feeders by September 30, 2016, and to submit quarterly segregated T&D loss data. The department did not pay heed to the direction, saying it is in process of implementing the smart grid project, which will help in determining T&D losses.
 
 Taking a serious view of the non-compliance, the commission on May 4, stated: “The department has repeatedly failed to comply with directives over the years on the pretext of ensuring compliance under one scheme or another.“ The commission di rected the department to submit a detailed report of voltage wise T&D losses before October 31, failing which action will be initiated. 
 
 The department has also been directed to submit action plan for installation of interface meters at all feeders within a month of the issuance of the order. According to norms of the commission, T&D losses cannot be more than 13.75% of the total power purchased.
 
 But the losses have been above 15% in the last three years, which has cost the state around Rs 40 crore. The department suffered T&D losses of 15.1% in 2014, which rose to 15.17% in 2015, and to 15.24% in 2016. Ageing infrastructure and overloading of transformers are the main reasons for the losses. 
 
 At present, there is only one 220-KV sub-station, 13 66-KV sub-stations and five 33-KV sub-stations. Five 66-KV sub-stations have completed their life span of 25 years.
 
 Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission on April 15, 2015 passed an order for initiating action for corporatisation of electricity department. A tender was floated on July 5, 2016, but failed to get any response. The department has been asked to expedite the process.
