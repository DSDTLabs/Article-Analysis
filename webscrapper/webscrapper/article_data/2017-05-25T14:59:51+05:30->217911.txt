LUCKNOW: After a series of strikes on petrol pumps to check malpractices, the   have stopped because of shortage of technical experts in teams constituted by district administration, ADM   Alka Verma to TOI.

 The crackdown began on April 28. State government has ordered to seize petrol pumps if their machines were found tampered. The machines were seized after anomalies found during inspection by technical staff of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and oil companies in presence of weight and measures and district administration officers.
 
 Out of 186, around 45 have been checked and around 20 petrol pumps have been seized betweern April 28 and May 16. The crackdown came to a halt on May 18 as there was no technical staff to carry out the raids with. According to weight and measures department, only technical staff of OEM and oil companies is allowed to open the machines.
 
 Alka Verma said, â€œWe have a team of technicians, one each from OEM and the oil company, besides two officials of weight and measurement department and area rationing officer and security personnel. The number of technical experts is not sufficient to raid petrol pumps at present, so for the last few days, we have not been able to raid.
 
 District supply officers and eight AROs have been transferred while new AROs have taken over recently and it will take time for them to gear up to suit the operation, so the raids will resume within three days. The district magistrate has directed oil companies to strengthen their technical teams and provide more technicians to district administration, added Verma.
