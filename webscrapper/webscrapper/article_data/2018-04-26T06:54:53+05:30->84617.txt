 Wangchuk’s idea of an alternative university is to build a unique institution that self-sustains and provides free higher education to its students and focusing on real-life learnings.
 
 Describing how it will function, he said, “It will be a university built with the earth and powered by the sun and all the learnings of the past 25 years will be used in building it. It will be a university where people will get hands-on experience, where school of business will run real-life companies, school of tourism will run high-end hotels and simple home stays while the school of education will run innovative schools. The revenue from these will sustain the university where the students will get free higher education.”
 
 Wangchuk has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the university. He said, “We received the Rolex Award in 2016 for our innovation on Ice Stupas and Rs 1 crore as a reward, which has been dedicated towards the university. The university project was announced on the day we received the award. Upon approaching corporate firms from across the country, we have managed to raise another Rs 1.5 crore.”
