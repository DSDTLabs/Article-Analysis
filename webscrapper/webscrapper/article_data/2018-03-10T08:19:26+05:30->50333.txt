Mythological show Karmaphal Daata   came to an end on March 9th. One person who is not part of the cast, but is still attached to the show and them is  's wife Ria Banerjee Ankola. 

 Actor Salil Ankolaâ€™s wife, who plays the character of Suryadev in the show, Ria is an integral part of the show as she is the one who sends food for the whole unit almost everyday. The whole cast used to enjoy delicious delicacies sent by Ria. 
 
  
  
 Speaking about her involvement in the show, Ria says,"The last one and an half years we had a great time. Through Shani I have got a huge family. The whole cast used to have food together and I believe that's why we bonded so well. Whether it is Gufi Sir or Kunal Bakshi or   we all are very close. With Juhi it is a different relation, she is like a family to us. The kids gang is very adorable and they are also our kids." 
 
  
  
 
 Ria feels Shani is a very significant landmark in Salil's career. She adds,"There was a time when Salil was asked to leave a mythological show as the channel felt his voice and physique did not suit his role. That was a huge set back for Salil and he took it as a challenge. After that he pulled down his weight and later on when he was approached for Suryadev's character he was reluctant, but it was me and the Producer Rahul Kumar Tewary who pushed him into this. We feel so proud when people give him positive feedback for Suryadev's character and how well his voice suits the role of Suryadev. They also say no one else could do justice to this apart from Salil."
