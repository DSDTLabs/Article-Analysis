PATNA: The Patna district administration has planned to create 20 ‘pink’ polling booths during the urban local body election in the state capital on June 4, which will be managed by women government personnel.

 At least 300 women presiding officers, polling officers and police personnel will be deployed at these 20 booths. “The idea is to prove that women are capable of doing everything, thereby underlining women empowerment,” Patna DM   told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Women employees are generally not deputed for election duty as they are in popular perception not considered capable of handling elections that involve bitter rivalry and at times bloody violence. “We have to break such stereotypes,” the DM said.
 
 Officials on duty at these ‘pink’ booths will be imparted special training on May 18. These model booths will be decorated in all pink -- pink curtains, pink balloons and even pink attire of the civil personnel on duty. Women cops will look after the security arrangments at these booths.
 
 The concept of ‘pink’ polling booth was introduced for the first time in Bihar in the 2015 state assembly election when seven such booths were created in Maoist-affected   district. Agarwal was then the DM of Gaya. 
 
 “The turnout at these pink booths was far higher than general booths... It was a fair-like scene. Since the booths were in Maoist-hit areas where a section of voters tend to abstain from voting, we gave our success a punchline: Red terror (turns) into pink festival,” a beaming Agarwal said and added the   awarded Gaya distridct for this innovation and later other states adopted the idea of pink polling booths.
 
 Training imparted to poll personnel: Around 3,500 Bihar government employees were on Saturday imparted training in conducting fair polling during the urban local body election in Patna district on June 4. Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the training sessions were held at Gardanibagh Girls’ High School and Patna Collegiate School.
