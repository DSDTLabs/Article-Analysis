When Midhun Manuel Thomas' directorial debut Aadu Oru Bheekara Jeeviyanu was tagged as a massive flop by Malayalis, neither the film's protagonist   nor its director thought that they will contemplate a sequel for the film.

 But exactly two years after its release, the duo have announced its sequel, which they plan to release in the coming Christmas.
 So what prompted them to go for a second part of a film that failed at the box office? Jayasurya says, 'Aadu received mostly criticism from reviewers. But after its CD release, people started loving the protagonist and so, we even re-released the film recently. My character in the film, protagonist Shaji Pappan, became such a hit that we were forced to think of a sequel.'
 
 With Shaji Pappan turning out to be a cult figure, will he be able to match the expectations of the audience? 'No, we have the freedom to explore our creativity beyond the limit and be more imaginative. We are sure we will come up with something better,' says an excited Jayasurya.
 And will Shaji Pappan flaunt his black kurta and red mundu, which became a style statement for Malayalis, in this series too? 'Well, he might try out something different!' says Jayasurya.
 
 Director Midhun tells us that the sequel is going to be a colourful mass action comedy. 'Aadu 2 will have another episode of Shaji Pappan's life. The actors, who were part of Shaji Pappan and team, will be retained,' he says. 
 
 Will there be the titular character, Pinky the goat, in the next version? 'Well, Pinky has become a mom now. But I cannot reveal the story line,' he says, adding that all he can say is that there will be a lot of action sequences as Shaji Pappan will be cured of his backache in the sequel and is all set for stunts and fights!'
 The film will go on floors in August.
