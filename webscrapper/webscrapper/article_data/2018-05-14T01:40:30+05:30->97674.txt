GURUGRAM: Air pollution in the city rose sharply over the weekend, with the highest level of   reported on Sunday at 198 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³), compared Friday’s high of 95µg/m³. 

 The   on Sunday evening made the situation worse. 
 
 Air quality index ( ) also went up to 357 (considered ‘very poor’) on Sunday, from 341 (also ‘very poor’) on Friday. It was 215 and 232 (‘poor’) on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. The situation in Gurugram is worse than neighbouring Delhi, which recorded 225 and 269 on Sunday and Saturday, respectively.
 
 According to   (HSPCB), an increase in wind speed is the main culprit behind the rise in concentration of particulate matter. “An increase in wind speed generally leads to dust pollution. The problem is that rain took place before the dust storm. If there is rain now, the concentration of PM2.5 will go down, reducing overall pollution levels too,” said a HSPCB official.
 
 Doctors advised people to avoid exposure to the outdoors during storms.
 
  “A rise in concentration of PM is reported during dust storms. We’re getting many cases of breathlessness. While asthma patients, elderly, children and pregnant women should avoid exposure to the outdoors, everyone can use masks during dust storms. It’s good to take such precautionary measures,” said Dr Himanshu Garg, a senior pulmonologist.
 
 The meteorological department expects cloudy sky, but an increase in average maximum temperature. The wind speed is likely to be in the range of 1-2m/sec. “We’re expecting cloudy skies on Monday. The average maximum temperature is likely to increase by 1-2 notches later in the week,” said a met official. The average maximum temperature on Sunday was 38°C and the average minimum temperature was 27°C. The average maximum temperature is expected to be 38-39°C on Monday.
