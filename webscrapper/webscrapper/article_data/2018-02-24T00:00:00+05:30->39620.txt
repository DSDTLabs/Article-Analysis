Actor Nirup Bhandari’s upcoming bilingual   has him reliving his   days. Directed by Anup Bhandari, the rom-com has Nirup playing a college student. “When I was in college, I used to stay very close to my college and some of my friends rented a house just opposite mine. So, I used to hang out with them a lot and spent a lot of time in the canteen. While shooting for Rajaratha, I got into that character and the mental space of a collegegoer — being free, spontaneous and curious,” says the actor.

 While a lot of scenes in the   have been inspired by Nirup’s college days, the ragging sequence is completely fictional. “I was never ragged in college, since I never lived in the hostel. Since Anup (Bhandari, his brother) was my senior, I knew most of his friends and they used to make fun of me and pull my leg, but no one ragged me at any point. Sometimes, they would ask me to sing a song for a girl in Hindi or English, but all those were completely harmless pranks,” says Nirup.
 
 In the ragging sequence in the film, however, Nirup is made to stand under the basketball hoop while his seniors dunk ball at him. “During the shoot, the ball would hit me on my face and my abdomen, and it would hurt me really bad, but even so, it was fun shooting those scenes,” he says, signing off.
