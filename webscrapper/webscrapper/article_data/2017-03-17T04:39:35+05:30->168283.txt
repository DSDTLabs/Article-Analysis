PANAJI: Minutes after failing to prove their strength on the floor of the 40-member state legislative assembly, Congress was in for another jolt on Thursday with its MLA   tendering his resignation immediately after taking oath. Speculations are rife that he may be inducted in the cabinet.

 After his resignation was accepted by protem speaker Sidharth Kuncalienker, Vishwajit stated that he would get re-elected in the bypolls.
 
 Upset with Congress central leadership, Vishwajit, the son of veteran Congress leader  , announced his plans to quit the party in a public tirade against the party's leadership, especially   general secretary  .
 
 “This is the first step of rebellion against the mismanagement of the party. I don’t have any intention to stay with this party. I am disillusioned with them (Congress).
 
 Should I remain in this party to rot?” Rane said, as he criticised the party for its failure to form the state government despite being the single largest party with 17 seats in the just concluded state assembly elections.
 
 Later, Rane told TOI that he remained committed to the people of   and would re-contest the elections from   constituency which gave an indication that Rane could re-contest under the   banner.
 
 “I will decide with my supporters and take a decision on my future. I will meet Parrikar also before I take a decision. I know my father is upset with me,” Rane said.
