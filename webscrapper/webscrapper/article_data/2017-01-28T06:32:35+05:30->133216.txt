JAIPUR: Search committees formed for appointing vice-chancellors in six universities will follow the Rajasthan University Act (amended 2013).

 The Act does not specify academic qualification for the post of V-C, giving free hand to search committees to nominate candidates for the post.
 
 According to UGC guidelines, candidates are required to have a minimum qualification of PhD and 10 years’ teaching experience as professor.
 
 The state has not yet adopted UGC guidelines. State higher education department senior official said the search committee and the governor were bound by state legislation—Rajasthan University Act (amended 2013) — while appointing V-Cs.
 
 The debate on appointments began after the   made critical observations on former RU V-C J P Singhal and said he was unfit for the post as his qualification fell short of UGC guidelines. The observation came during the hearing on a petition that challenged his appointment.
 
 To incorporate UGC recommendations, the Act has to be amended either though an ordinance or legislation in the coming session.
 
 However, the selection of V-Cs in these six universities is at a progressive stage. TOI repeatedly called higher education minister Kiren Maheswari but failed to get comments on the issue.
 
 “Had the high court passed an order to follow UGC regulations 2010, which includes the eligibility criteria for V-C, it would have created a storm in many state universities. The oral criticism is not on record,” a senior education department official had said earlier on condition of anonymity.
 
 Search committees of   (Sikar),   (Bharatpur),   (Bikaner), Guru Gobind University (Banswara) and   (RUHS) are reviewing the shortlisting of candidates.
 
 Under the existing Act, the search committees make a subjective recommendation without giving any weightage to applicants. Even candidates who apply only get to know if they have been selected when the final list comes out.
