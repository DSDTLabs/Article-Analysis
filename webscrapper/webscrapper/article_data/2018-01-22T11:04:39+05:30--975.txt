CHANDIGARH: The CEO of Patanjali, Acharya  , put his weight behind legalizing cannabis for medical purposes, and for opening business and employment opportunities in India, at a TEDx event in   on Sunday. 

 Balkrishna -who is close to yoga guru  , who owns Patanjali - said his company had been in touch with the Union ministry of AYUSH for this. "Research is already on. It has been found that much of it (cannabis plant) is good for health. But, toxic parts, like THC, need to be removed from cannabis oil," he said. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the part of cannabis plant responsible for giving a high to a person who consumes the plant in any form.
 
 Balkrishna said seeds of the plant were useful, the fibre could be used for clothes, and the plant's controlled cultivation could help India raise a new industry altogether. "By criminalizing marijuana, we are denying a full-fledged business opportunity to our people," he said.
 
 In August 2017, Union women and child development minister   suggested legalising marijuana for medical purposes in India, like several other countries have done. She had put her weight behind legalising the plant for pain-relief treatment among cancer patients.
 
 At the event, Balkrishna went on to appeal to the youth of the nation to adopt a constructive thought process. "They are the future of the world. However, society needs to give them an atmosphere which inspires innovation and a desire to learn and seek knowledge," he said.
