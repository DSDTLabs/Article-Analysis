CHANDIGARH: A gang of goons on Monday night shot dead a   worker in busy market on   road in Bahadurgarh city. Assailants pumped 12 bullets into   Joon.

 Bahadurgarh DSP   said the incident was an outcome of family enmity. The cops have picked up father of one of the suspects named by the victim’s family.
 
 The incident has also brought the role of police under the scanner. According to Monu’s family, Bahadurgarh cops had ignored his complaint against the suspects who had allegedly made a ransom call to him last month.
 
 Kin of the victim on Tuesday did not allow the cops to shift the body for an autopsy till Hansraj himself assured them of a speedy action.
 
 “We handed over the body to the family after the autopsy. We have picked up father of one of the suspects and he is being interrogated. Meanwhile, this is an outcome of a family dispute over money,” he said.
 
 The incident occurred on Monday evening when Monu was sitting outside the barber shop on Jhajjar road. Six persons, armed with country-made weapons, fired at him and escaped after leaving him in a pool of blood.
 
 He was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. The autopsy report confirmed 12 bullet injuries on his body. Forensic experts collected 18 empty bullet shells.
