CHENNAI: Stung by a string of high-profile accidents across the country, the   has come out with a rule that bars   from being office-bearers of a recognised trade union.

 The January 30 circular has led to heated discussions. “Supervisors working in safety category posts play a pivotal role in ensuring safe running of trains. In wake of current situation, these supervisors need to put in their best effort to ensure that staff working under them are alert at all times as railways works 24/7,” the circular issued by deputy director Nirmala U Tirkey said.
 
 In November 2016, the Indore-Patna Express derailed leaving 150 dead and an equal number injured. Last month, a passenger train derailed in Andhra Pradesh resulting in 41 deaths.   itself had five accidents in 2016, including a collision on Chennai’s outskirts.
 
 A senior railways official said supervisors who were office-bearers of a union had to devote substantial time for their additional responsibilities. “They are not able to give un-divided time to their primary duty, which is that of ensuring safety of trains and passengers,” he said.
 
  The new rule, however, does not restrict safety supervisiors from being members of recognised unions.
 
 International labour leader and Southern Railway Mazdoor Union (SRMU) president C A Rajasridhar told TOI the circular was ‘against the freedom of association’. “This circular is a humbug. Railways has not been able to give credible answers to the public on the Kanpur-derailment which resulted in more than 150 deaths. To suppress public anger, this circular targeting employees has been issued,” he said.
 
 SRMU is the sole recognised union of Southern Railway and is affiliated to   (AIRF).
 
 Rajasridhar the circular adopted double standards as it applied only to recognised unions. “There are a number of associations and other unions which have not won in the election. They can continue to have office-bearers from safety department. This is not correct,” he said.
