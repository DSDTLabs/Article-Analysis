PUNE: The city will have around 700 voters per booth compared to the 1,000 voters during the last election in 2012.

 “Each voter will have to cast four votes. It will be time-consuming. So if the voters’ numbers are high at the booths, it will be difficult. We have planned redesigning of voters’ booths in the city,” municipal commissioner   said. 
 
 Kumar, who is coordinating the election management, said they are in talks with housing societies so as to make polling facilities available at their doorsteps. The city will have 3,300 polling stations. Along with the old polling booths, new places will be introduced.
 
 The final voters’ lists has not been finalised as yet. Kumar said a software glitch has caused the delay. They are in touch with the election commission to make sure that the lists are published in a day or two. 
 
 As many as 10 municipal corporations, including Pune, will go the polls on February 21 and the results will be announced on February 23. Over 26.43 lakh voters have registered for this election. They will elect 162 corporators.
 
 The city has been divided into 41 municipal panels. Each panel will have four wards. This is the first time the voters will have to cast four votes. During the last election each panel had two wards and a voter had to cast only two votes.
