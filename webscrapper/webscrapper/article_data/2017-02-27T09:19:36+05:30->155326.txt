COIMBATORE: More than 200 volunteers on Sunday cleaned   lake and removed all plastic waste dumped into it over the years.

 Students, women, residents, members of NGOs and corporation workers gathered at the lake on Sunday early morning. Armed with brooms, gloves and machinery they cleared the garbage in the lake.
 
 They collected nearly one tonne of plastic waste from the lake. The drive was taken out with the permission of the civic body, which also provided them with workforce and machinery.
 
 Women drove earth movers and cleaned the lake. “I was incharge of an earth mover and cleaned the garbage. It was a fulfilling exercise. We will surely take part in drives like this in the future,” said Timple, Swachh Bharat ambassador for  .
 
 Several residential welfare associations also took part in the cleanliness drive. Secretary of residential awareness association of Coimbatore, Raveendran said, “Most times, people throw plastic waste into drains. Since almost all the drains are connected to the lakes, they get carried to the lakes. After the water dries up, the plastics are left on the surface of the lakes. So, we decided to clean it up,” he said.
 
 Pointing out that that the drive was not over, he said, “We will continue to clean the lake next weekend.”
 
 At least 40 corporation workers facilitated the clean-up drive by providing machinery and equipment. “We will put up boards to curb dumping of plastic waste into the lake and ensure its cleanliness,” they said.
