AHMEDABAD: The   on Tuesday stayed the special court from proceeding further against suspended IAS officer   in a   case registered against him by the enforcement directorate.

 In response to an application by Sharma, Justice S G Shah observed that from the material on record, there is prima facie a case in favour of Sharma. This comes in contrast to the special court’s observation earlier this month that there prima facie appears to be a case against Sharma.
 
 The high court admitted Sharma’s petition, sought a reply from the ED and posted further hearing on April 10.
 
  
  ED lodged a complaint against Sharma under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( ) in 2016. He was arrested last year after all courts refused to grant him anticipatory bail. Money laundering charges were invoked against Sharma on the basis of two cases registered under the IPC by CID (crime) and the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in 2010, with regard to allocation of land to a private firm at a price lower than the market rate.
 
 After the special court rejected Sharma’s plea for a discharge, he approached the HC and argued that charges under PMLA were invoked by ED on basis of a scheduled offence, which had allegedly taken place much before the recent PMLA law came into being. The law cannot be applied to an offence with a retrospective effect, said Sharma’s advocate H B Champavat.
 
 Sharma was first arrested in 2010 and was behind bars for a considerable period on corruption charges.
