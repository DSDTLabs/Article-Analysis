GURUGRAM: Days after the CBI chargesheet ruled out the role of four youths arrested by the special investigation team (SIT) in the Dingerheri   case, Gurugram MP Rao Inderjeet   has demanded strict action against the erring cops.

 Rao said the cops, who made “hasty arrests under political and media pressure”, should be dealt with sternly if the CBI chargesheet proved that the real accused were members of the Axle gang, as they had ruined the lives of the four youths. “Our judicial system clearly preaches that 100 guilty may be let off, but not even a single innocent should not be framed or punished,” Singh said.
 
 Singh added had the members of the Axle gang not confessed, these youths would have been punished for a crime they never committed. “The damage has been done as these men and their families fear for their lives. Their dreams have been shattered,” he said.
 
 The counsel for the youths, Pardeep Rapria, on Monday had said the fresh chargesheet proved the innocence of these four youths arrested by the SIT. “It has also exposed how unreliable the police can be when it comes to investigating grave crimes amidst a public outcry and close media scrutiny,”   had said.
 
 On the intervening night of August 24 and 25, 2016, a family in   was attacked. A Muslim couple was killed and several of their family members were injured and a 21-year-old woman and 16-year-old girl from the family were raped.
