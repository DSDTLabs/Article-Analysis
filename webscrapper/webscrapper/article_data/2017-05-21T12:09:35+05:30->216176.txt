MUMBAI: A 29-year-old   resident has been arrested for allegedly cheating ATM cardholders at kiosks in Mumbai, Thane and Mira-Bhayander. The accused,  , who is originally from Ahmedabad, used to steal ATM cards and PIN numbers and withdraw cash to splurge on bar dancers and drinks. 

 Bhat was nabbed from a bar on   on Friday. He has confessed to two withdrawals of Rs 60,000. 
 
 The police said Bhat used to keep watch on ATM kiosks and offered help when a senior citizen or woman came to the kiosk.
 
 On April 24, when a retired man went to an SBI kiosk in Mira Road to withdraw cash, Bhat offered help as the man could not operate the machine.
 
 The elderly man gave his card to Bhat and shared his PIN. Bhat pretended to use the card, but told the man that the transaction could not be completed and returned the card and left. 
 
 What the senior citizen did not realize was that Bhat had exchanged his card for an expired ATM card. It was only when Rs 40,000 was withdrawn from his account that he realized that he had been conned. He lodged a complaint at Mira Road police station. CCTVs at the kiosk captured Bhat's image.
 
 Last month, another man was duped of Rs 19,500 when Bhat stole his card on the pretext of helping him. The police said Bhat was once employed with a stockbroker. He lived with a bar girl in   and splurged money on dancers. Bhat has been sent to police custody till Monday.
