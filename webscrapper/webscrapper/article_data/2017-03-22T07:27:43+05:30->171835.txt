PANAJI: Activists cleaning up and restoring famous cartoonist Mario Miranda’s murals on the city market walls has brought to the fore the nuisance of spitting. Now,   (VHAG) wants Panaji to be made gutkha-free and smoke-free.

 “Implementing of the ban on gutkha and making Panaji a smoke-free city will go a long way in, not only improving the people’s health, but also in keeping the city clean and hygienic,” VHAG president   stated.
 
 In a memorandum issued to corporation of the city of Panaji (CCP) mayor,  , the association extended its support to the corporation if it takes up a campaign to rid the city of ill effects of gutkha and make it smoke-free.
 
 The ‘paan’-soaked walls of the market, which is a heavily thronged public spot, exposes the inefficacy of authorities in stopping the nuisance. Other places in the city also indicate how some citizens care little about discharging their civic duties. Within a few days of the cleaning the market, it was dirtied again with pan stains.
 
 Though Goa was the first state to ban gutkha in 2005, it is easily available, as shops and outlets, small and big, stock and sell it with hardly any preventive action undertaken by the authorities. 
 
 “The health hazards of gutka are well documented. Everyday, thousands fall prey to the hazards of these deadly pouches,” VHAG stated.
 
 The pouches mix with other plastic waste and choke storm water drains during monsoon. “The red spray on footpaths, walls, offices and the market is also an ugly sight, unhygienic and a blot on the city,” Vaidya said.
 
 VHAG has submitted a list of smoke-free cities and districts in India.
