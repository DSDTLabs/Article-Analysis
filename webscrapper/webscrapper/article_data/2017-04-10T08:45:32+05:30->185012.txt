LUCKNOW: All   allotted by the   in UP will now pass through the   process. Until now, this process was applicable only to contracts of Rs 1 crore and above. The Yogi government has abolished that limit.

 A government order (GO) has been issued saying that all contracts, irrespective of the amount, will be allotted through the e-tendering process. “The (PWD) department will also check unscrupulous and mafia elements from gaining contracts,” stated the order signed by additional chief secretary, PWD, Sadakant.
 
 Sources said there had been a practice of circumventing the prevailing system by breaking the contractual work into smaller segments to reduce the amount and allot it to a few ‘favoured’ contractors. “That will not be possible now. Even the smallest of the contracts will pass through the e-tendering process,” said a senior PWD official.
 
 PWD chief engineer VK Singh said that contracts worth as low as Rs 1 lakh will now undergo a transparent allotment procedure. The GO said it had been widely observed that previous e-tendering system was not being followed by field offices because of “one or the other technical problems”. “The problem needs to be checked and addressed. The department will review the system on a time to time basis,” said Sadakant.
 
  The development comes close on the heels of CM Aditya Nath Yogi’s announcement to get all the roads pothole-free by June 15. Officials said the department will now have to float tenders for even smallest of the road segments and allot contracts through a transparent e-tendering process.
 
  During the presentation of housing and urban planning department here on Saturday night, Yogi directed minister of state for housing Suresh Pasi to present the inspection reports of Jai Prakash Narayan International Centre and beautification of Husainabad area to him.
