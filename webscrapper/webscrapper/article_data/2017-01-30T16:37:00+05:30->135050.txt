NEW DELHI: "Former Prime Minister   helped beleaguered businessman 
  get huge loans to bail out  ," the Bharatiya Janata Party claimed on Monday.

 "A bail-out package was given to Kingfisher Airlines on Manmohan Singh's insistence. Not only that, only on the former Prime Minister's insistence, the income tax department went soft on   and his accounts were also unfrozen,"   spokesperson Sambit Patra said in a press conference on Monday.
 
 Referring to the oft-asked question about why Mallya was given a loan of Rs 9,000 crore despite KIngfisher having very poor ratings and their accounts not being in order, Patra asked: "Were there certain hands pulling the strings from behind?" 
 
 "Was a sinking ship, that is, the Congress, helping out the sinking 
  ?" he asked.
 
 Patra said he has "certain emails, letters and correspondence that will expose these hands". Again and again, "the kind indulgence of the then PM was sought by Mallya," said Patra.
 
 "The first 
  was granted in 2004, then in 2008. Despite his companies' declared NPAs, restructuring of his loan was done in 2010," Patra said.
 
 The SBI and state-run Punjab National Bank had declared Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines and its holding firm UBHL (United Breweries Holdings Ltd.) "wilful defaulters" in 2015.
 
 Besides the SBI, other state-run and private banks that gave loans to Kingfisher include Bank of Baroda, State Bank of Mysore, Axis Bank, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu and Kashmir Bank, IDBI Bank, Punjab National Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, UCO Bank and United Bank of India.
 
 The 61-year-old Mallya is reported to be in Britain since he left India on March 2, 2016, after the consortium moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal in February last year to expedite the hearing on its debt recovery petition.
 
 In April, a non-bailable arrest warrant was issued against Mallya by a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court judge, on a plea by the Enforcement Directorate.
