NEW DELHI:   on Monday opposed the installation of   cameras at the Brahmaputra hostel, claiming that this was an attempt by the administration to “increase surveillance and monitor their movements.” The administration, however, said that it was a “routine procedure done in accordance with the high court’s observations.”

 Students at the hostel came across electricians who told them that wiring work for the WiFi connection was underway. However, some students demanded a formal permission letter for the activity. 
 
 “We asked the caretaker, who guided us to the computer department,” said Satarupa Chakraborty,   Students Union (JNUSU) general secretary. There the students came to know about the cameras.
 
 Pramod Shastri, registrar said, “Questions over the absence of CCTV cameras were raised during the hearing of Najeeb Ahmed’s disappearance. So we decided to set up cameras to improve security in the campus.”
