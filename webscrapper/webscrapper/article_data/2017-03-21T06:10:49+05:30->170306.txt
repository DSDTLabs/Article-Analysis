LUCKNOW: In his first address to the   and his 46 new ministers, governor   enlisted dos and don’ts for their day to day   and asked them to avoid mistakes of the past government.

 Naik had invited the entire cabinet to the Raj Bhawan on Monday evening for an introduction and more than two-hour session.
 
 Naik, who had been ruthless and unsparing on the   government in the last two-and-a-half years since he was appointed as governor of Uttar Pradesh, alerted the new BJP government saying it should not be seen as shielding the corrupt. He recalled how he had to fight against many issues, including nomination of candidates for the council and appointment of the Lokayukta to guard the Constitution.
 
 Addressing the ministers, Naik advised them to redress grievances of the most ordinary of citizens. He said the former chief minister did not act on nearly 50 reports of the Lokayukta on cases of corruption against former ministers and officers and the new government must avoid doing so.
 
 About the ministers, Naik said since most of them were first-timers and inexperienced, they should read every official letter attentively. “I was at times irritated at the functioning of Akhilesh Yadav, who would often not take trouble to respond to official communications from Raj Bhawan,” said the governor.
 
 Speaking at the occasion, chief minister   said he and his cabinet colleagues had a lot to learn from the political journey of Ram Naik who has been MP twice, in 1998 and 99.
 
 Speaking to the TOI, Swati Singh, minister of state with Independent charge and a first-timer in the government, said she drew inspiration from Ram Naik.
