 is all set to weave her magic in the   film industry. The   singer will make her debut in the Chikkanna-starrer,  . And the song, says composer  , will take everyone back in time. “The song will make people feel nostalgic about their childhood. I looked for singers here and in   who would suit the song, after which I found Vaikom Vijayalakshmi. Her voice suits the song best. She liked the song and studied it for around a week. Since she is visually impaired, she memorized it, and although this was her first tryst with Kannada, we recorded the song in 3-4 hours. Her pronunciations were just right and she has sung it like a Kannadiga,” he says.

 
 
 Another singer who will debut in Bill Gates is Sanjith Hegde of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa fame. The singer from the show’s season 13 has gained popularity in recent times and will sing a romantic number in the film. “He is a young singer, but has a very good voice. We will be introducing him as well in Kannada films with this movie. In fact, his song will be released before Vaikom Vijayalakshmi’s number,” says Nobin.
