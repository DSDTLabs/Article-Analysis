Panaji: MLAs on Wednesday demanded that foreign students studying in Goa be “watched” as some of them could be involved in the drug trade.  Stating that there were a few Nigerians in the state on student visa, opposition leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar said that it was needed to be examined if they are involved in drug activities. Speaker Pramod Sawant asked Kavlekar not to target nationalities. Senior Congress functionary and Poriem legislator Pratapsingh Rane asked the state government to deport foreign students if they are found involved in any criminal activity. tnn
