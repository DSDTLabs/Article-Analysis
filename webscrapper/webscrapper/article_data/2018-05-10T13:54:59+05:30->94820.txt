PANAJI: Two new Marathi-medium primary schools by private managements have received the state government’s nod to open from June 2018. While one school will open in   in  , the other will operate from Ela in Old Goa, director of education GP Bhat said on Wednesday.

 During the last two academic years, no new primary schools had been permitted to open. “The feasibility report for five more new schools is pending with the state government for its consideration and report of four other new schools are awaited,” Bhat said. The directorate of education (DoE) had received applications to open 63 new primary schools from the academic year 2018-19, of which, the state is yet to take a decision on nine proposals, while two are permitted to open and 52 applications stand rejected.
 
 Bhat said that a couple of new high schools may also be permitted to open from June. DoE has received 12 applications to open new high schools during the upcoming academic year 2018-19, most are English- medium institutes.
 
 This year, 15 managements had sought permissions to open English-medium private primary schools. All 15 applications were rejected outright, as the state has adopted a medium-of-instruction policy to encourage only regional language schools.
 
 The proposal to open 52 Konkani,   and   primary schools were rejected based on feasibility reports submitted by the respective ADEI, where it is found that a new school can affect enrolment of an existing school in the neighbourhood.
