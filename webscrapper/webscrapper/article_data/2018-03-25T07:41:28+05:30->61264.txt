BATHINDA: Farmers and farm organisations have described Punjab government’s move to allocate Rs 4,250 crore to farm debt waiver in the 2018-19 budget as “miniscule” when compared to the total farm debt of over Rs 80,000 crore.

 The   government has set aside Rs 14,734 crore for agriculture in the fiscal, nearly 40% more than the Rs 10,581 crore set aside in the last financial year. The budget for free power to agriculture sector has been kept at Rs 6,256 crore.
 
 Farmers said allocation was just a little over 5% of the total debt on them. They also claimed that though the state government kept Rs 1,500 crore for debt waiver in the 2017-18 budget, it wrote off loans worth Rs 370 crore of 71,000 farmers.
 
 Punjab has nearly 10.50 lakh farm families and nearly 20 lakh farmers. “While announcing debt waiver last year, the state government had promised to waive loans amounting to nearly Rs 10,000 crore. In the first year, it waived loans of Rs 370 crore only. Now, the government has kept a provision of only Rs 4,250 crore. The state government should have kept its word on waiver amount. We will continue to fight for complete loan waiver, as the ruling Congress had promised before elections,” said farmer organization   (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary  .
 
 A farmer from Kot Shamir village in Bathinda district,  , said they had only gotten assurances in the past one year. “Now, with the partial amount kept in the budget, we may not get the waiver at all,” said Jaswant, who owns 3.5 acres and has a debt of Rs 2 lakh.
 
  of Sangat village in Bathinda, who owns 2.5 acres and has a debt of Rs 1.85 lakh, said farming was not a lucrative option any more. “We need some support to sustain ourselves. We had high hopes from the Congress and had hoped that our debt would be cleared as promised. Now, we feel many farmers like will may not get the benefit,” he said.
 
 BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill said the Congress government was toeing the line of the previous SAD-BJP regime by “ignoring” farmers. “The government doesn’t seem to be bothered about the woes of the farming community. We will soon hold a joint meeting with other farmer organizations and will plan protests,” he said.
