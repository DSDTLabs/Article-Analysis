DEHRADUN: A day after chief minister   announced to hold a fast at   in Delhi against the Centre's approach on the 
  master plan, the state Congress unit came out in his support. Congress state chief Kishore Upadhyay on Monday said that the party members in large numbers would be present at Jantar Mantar on January 5 to support Rawat.

 Upadhyay said that the project aims to develop the entire stretch of Bhagirathi river from Gamukh to Uttarkashi as eco-sensitive zone. "If the proposals of the Centre were implemented in their present form, thousands of people in this belt will suffer financially. Therefore, the state government under its zonal master plan had asked to set up hydro-power project of lower capacity," he said.
 
 The state Congress chief claimed that party workers from all 13 districts would reach Jantar Mantar on Thursday morning. "The move of the Centre to oppose the zonal master plan in the National Green Tribunal is against the people of Uttarakhand and we will oppose the move," said Upadhyay.
 
 Meanwhile, the CM maintained that the matter should not be linked with politics. "It has nothing to do with either politics or the next elections. It is a public related issue. Therefore, we have raised it. The developments have been a recent one, so we are opposing it now. Neither this matter is planned nor has any political connection," added Rawat.
 
 About four years back, the environment ministry had notified 100-km area of Bhagirathi river from its origin at Gamukh to Uttarkashi as eco-sensitive zone. It prohibited new hydro-electric power project and also the expansion of existing plants on the stretch. It also banned all forms of mining of minerals except those for domestic purpose by locals. The state government had sought amendments in the 2012 notification to incorporate in it hydroelectric power projects of up to 25 MW capacity.
