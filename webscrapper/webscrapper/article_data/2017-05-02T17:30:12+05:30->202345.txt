Actress   is not one to let her National Award go to her head. In a recent speech she made at a meeting held at Kozhikode to honour her, she left the audience rolling on the floor laughing with her uninhibited manner of speaking. 

 In the early days of her film career, she said, noone used to give her a proper script and she would often reach the set with no clue what character she was doing. "I would just get to know that   is part of the film and say yes," she said. The same happened with a   film too, she added, even as Suresh Gopi listened to her from the dias. "Say Suresh Gopi and I would be reminded of his movie The Commissioner and the background music with which his entry would be accompanied by," with that she hummed a tune, which happened to be the wrong one, leaving the entire audience laughing.
