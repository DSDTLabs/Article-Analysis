BENGALURU: Three Class VII students who went missing on Wednesday from Byappanahalli in east Bengaluru were traced in Hyderabad on Thursday morning. The trio were had performed poorly in school tests and were afraid that their parents would scold them.

 The three boys, aged around 12, are students of a private school in CV Raman Nagar. They went missing soon after they left school for home on Wednesday. Their parents lodged a missing complaint with the Byappanahalli police by night.
 
 Investigating officials said they hatched a plan to run away on Saturday after their class teacher announced a parent-teacher meeting. “The school teachers were unhappy with the three students over their average performance in tests. They told the boys to get their parents to the meeting and said the elders would be apprised of their wards’ academic record. Fearing this, the boys decided to run away,” a police officer said.
 
 The boys had enough pocket money to buy tickets. “They boarded a private bus at Majestic and reached Hyderabad on Thursday morning. The staff of the private bus, however, were suspicious and detained the boys. They asked the boys how they happened to be there on their own. “One of them broke down and revealed everything. The bus staff informed Hyderabad police who alerted us,” the officer said. “We have sent a team to bring the children back. They should be here by tomorrow.”
