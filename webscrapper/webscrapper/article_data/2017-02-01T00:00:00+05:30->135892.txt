MUMBAI: Promising sops to voters at a meeting near Mohammed Ali Road on Sunday, Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) leader and Telangana MLA   said his party would sell 20 litres distilled   for Re 1 and a plate of   for Rs 5 to Mumbaikars. He said   had done it in Hyderabad and would replicate it in Mumbai. 

 “All these years you have backed different parties. Now, give MIM a chance to serve you at the  ,” Owaisi said. 
 
 MIM, added Byculla legislator Waris Pathan, would buy water from BMC, set up distillation plants and establish eateries to give subsidized food to the poor. “The poor suffer the most as most of them cannot afford distilled water and therefore drink unsafe water and fall ill. We can sell a plate of food for Rs 5 by subsidizing it,” said Pathan.
 
 Welcoming former city Congress minority cell president Nizamuddin Rayeen to MIM, Owaisi and Pathan vowed to vanquish Congress, NCP and SP. “Today, if you speak against BJP, you are labelled anti-national. If you speak against Congress and SP, you are called anti-secularism. But we will not stop from speaking up against injustice,” Owaisi said.
 
 Rayeen, whose son Noaman is likely to be nominated from ward 213 (Nagpada-Kamathipura) on an MIM ticket, said Congress had lost its credibility among minorities. “The party’s facade of secularism is completely exposed. It claims to fight for rights of minorities but actually it does not practice what it preaches,” said Rayeen. Congress leaders had alleged that Rayeen wanted a ticket for his son and quit as his request was rejected.
