KOLKATA: Amid the raging debate over carcass meat sale in Kolkata and the suburbs,   on Thursday decided to set up   across the city. However, the current system of keeping vigil over sale of stale meat was grossly inadequate, felt a section of health department officials.

  
  
 
 At present there are two major slaughterhouses at Tangra. In a meeting held at the   headquarters, the civic top brass decided to set up 16 new mechanized slaughterhouses in the borough level to ensure that animals are brought to these houses for a health check-up. After going through a process of health check-up, the meat sellers will be given a certificate from a registered veterinary surgeon, which has to be displayed at the shops. The KMC will offer the meat sellers an opportunity to get their animals slaughtered at the civic slaughterhouses against a fee.
 
 “We have decided to set up at least 16 slaughterhouses in the borough level. The idea is to ward off the scare of a carcass meat racket operating in the city,” said  , the member, mayor-in-council overseeing the health department.
 
 During discussion at the meeting attended by state food safety commissioner Atin Ghosh, municipal commissioner   and heads of health, conservancy and market departments, the officials proposed to form a special task force at the borough level to keep round-the-clock vigil on the racket. It was decided that the special task force would be formed with officials from the health, conservancy and market departments.
 
 Since dearth of food safety officers may derail the civic body’s plan to take on unscrupulous meat traders, it was decided that the civic body would engage19 more food inspectors who will be active in the borough level. “These new recruits will man major municipal markets,” said the MMiC. The KMC will be in contact with both state and city police Enforcement Branch to take on a section of influential meat racket operators, said a KMC official.
