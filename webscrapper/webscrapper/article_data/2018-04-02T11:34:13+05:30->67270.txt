HYDERABAD: The TRS government has committed a serious economic offence by manipulating figures to show a deficit budget as revenue surplus budget and the Congress is exploring all legal options to take the government to task, said   Pradesh Congress Committee president N   Kumar Reddy.

 Addressing a press conference along with AICC secretary RC Khuntia, leader of opposition in   Mohammed  , MLA Revanth Reddy and other leaders here on Sunday, Uttam called upon chief minister   to explain the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)report and step down.
 
 “The KCR government has committed a serious economic crime, which is unprecedented in the country. Congress is exploring all legal means to take action against the chief minister, finance minister, finance secretary and other officials concerned for manipulating figures to show a deficit budget as revenue surplus one. The government has also violated the FRBM ceiling of 3.5% and borrowed loans up to 4.8%,” he said, adding that the government fudged budget figures by showing loans as revenue.
 
 Uttam said this was done not only to mislead people and show Telangana as the richest and revenue-surplus state, but also to cheat financial institutions to get more loans.
 
 Md Ali Shabbir demanded that KCR and his team of ministers should apologise and resign. “The financial mismanagement and lack of spending of the budget allocated to various sectors has exposed that KCR and his team lacks experience. He has lost moral ground to rule the state,” he said.
