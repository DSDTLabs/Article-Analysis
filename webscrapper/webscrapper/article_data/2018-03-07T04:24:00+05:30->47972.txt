Vadodara: Baroda Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya of MS University which has little over 100 students admitted under its different courses will be made a faculty with a new name â€“ Faculty of Traditional Sanskrit Studies. The decision was taken in the syndicate meeting on Tuesday.

 The college which is currently under Faculty of Arts has under-graduate, post-graduate, diploma and certificate courses. But once the faculty will be made, it will have four departments including a Department of Indology. With less number of students and no provision of grants and staff, the fate of the new faculty may end up like the Faculty of Journalism and Mass Communication which does not have a regular dean and permanent staff since many years.
 
 The university is also planning to turn the architecture department into the faculty. However, the issue was not brought up in the syndicate meeting on Tuesday. After a faculty board meeting takes place and a representation is done by the Faculty of Technology and Engineering, the decision on architecture department will be taken.
 
 Among other thing that received a syndicate nod was raising fee of English medium students of University Experimental School. It has also been decided that the investment committee of the university will now invest money in the nationalized banks or in RBI bonds only to avoid any kind of risk. Investments in the co-operative banks was stopped by the MSU several years ago.
