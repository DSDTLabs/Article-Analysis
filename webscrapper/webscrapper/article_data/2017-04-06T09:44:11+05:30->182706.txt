PUNE: The   ( ) will get around Rs 12 crore from the   as reimbursement for free passes that the transport utility allots to students and other beneficiaries. 

 This was decided at the Pune Municipal Corporation’s ( ) standing committee meeting on Wednesday.
 
 “The standing committee discussed and approved the proposal, as it is important for the students and the public transport system,” said Muralidhar Mohol, chairman of the standing committee.
 
 The civic body had introduced the free bus pass scheme in 2009-10 and the students were getting free passes to promote the public transport. In 2015, the administration introduced a nominal fee for the passes.
 
 “The scheme is called free bus pass scheme. But a decision to charge around 25 % cost of the passes was taken in 2015. It was observed that some students were misusing the scheme by availing of its benefits even after completing school education,” a senior PMC official said.
 
 Around 47,000 students, including those studying in PMC and private schools, enjoy the benefits of the free passes. The PMC spends around Rs 20 crore on the scheme. The transport utility has set up 35 pass centers in urban and rural Pune for the scheme. Besides students, civic staffers and elected members also get the free bus passes. 
 
 The PMPML currently has a fleet of 1,000 buses, transporting over eight lakh passengers a day. It has 10 bus depots and 20 main stations along 282 routes.
