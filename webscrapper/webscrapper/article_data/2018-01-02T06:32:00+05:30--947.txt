KOLKATA: The new year has ushered in good news for as many as 25 films — including Rituparna Sengupta-Indraneil Sengupta’s ‘Nilachale Kiriti’, Rituparna-Debshankar Halder’s ‘Gohin Hridoy’ and Jeet’s ‘Inspector   K’ — that are awaiting examination by the local  . 

 Ending the month-long crisis, a new regional officer has finally been appointed for the Kolkata office. Samrat Bandopadhyay, current deputy director (M&C) of Press Information Bureau, is expected to take charge in Kolkata.
 
 CBFC CEO Anurag Srivastava said: “The new regional officer is likely to join next Monday.” 
 
 The last one month had been challenging after the sudden ‘exit’ of Ajay Mhamia, the regional officer of CBFC Kolkata, on December 1. A stopgap arrangement was made and Mumbai CBFC sent Dipak Tandel to examine a few films, especially those that either had a National Award application pending or an impending release date.
 
 Ranjan Ghosh’s ‘Rongberonger Korhi ’, which courted controversy for using the names Ram-Sita filing for divorce, wasn’t examined during this period. “The CBFC had wanted to examine my film on December 23. But since I was out of town and my producer was out of the country, it couldn’t be done,” said Ghosh, vacationing at the fort of Chittorgarh.
 
 Meanwhile, there is another change of date for review of the documentary on   titled ‘The Argumentative Indian’. The meeting will now happen on January 4. Director   said: “I am hoping for the best.”
