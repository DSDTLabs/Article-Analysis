MUMBAI:  , one of the   being built in India for the navy, is about to be commissioned and inducted into the force between March and midJune. A second submarine,  , the construction of which at   is over, will be launched on January 12.

 The dock is expected to deliver the remaining four by 2020. The six Scorpene submarines, which are being indigenised, are called Kalvari-class.
 
 The project is running four years behind schedule. The construction of the first submarine started on May 23, 2009. The project courted controversy when last year a foreign news agency broke news of a data leak. Later, chief of naval staff Admiral Sunil Lanba said a probe had revealed that the leak occurred at the office of the naval defence contractor DCNS in France and not in India.
 
 All of the six diesel-electric attack submarines, designed by French naval defence and energy company DCNS, are being manufactured by   (MDL) in Mumbai. On INS Khanderi, an MDL official said all equipment have been installed and 95% of cabling and piping are complete. Pressure testing and the commissioning of various systems are in progress, and will continue even after the submarine's launch.
