PUNE: The   for the long pending   railway line is expected to get over by the month-end. 

 Senior railway officials said a report on it would be sent to the railway ministry, which would then release the funds.
 
 A Pune-based private firm is conducting the survey. Officials at the   of the   said the survey will give them a proper idea of the estimated cost of the project, besides other important details of ways to execute the project. “It is an ambitious project of the railways and we expect a lot of money will be needed for land acquisition,” an official told TOI.
 
 This year’s railway budget has an allocation of Rs 2,425 crore for the line, which will span across 265km. The line is proposed to run along towns like Chakan, Rajgurunagar, Manchar, Narayangaon, Alephata and Sinnar.
 
 “Once the report comes through, we will be able to know the basics of construction and can plan accordingly. We will be able to know the number of bridges, road over bridges and tunnels required. We are sure the work will start by this year,” the official said.
 
 The survey will also propose the alignment of the track and study various other aspects like location of stations, loading-unloading places, possible freight and passenger quantum in detail.
