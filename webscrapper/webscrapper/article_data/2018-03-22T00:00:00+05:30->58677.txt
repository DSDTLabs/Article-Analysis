Producer TP Siddaraju, who along with his partners, revived one of Yogi’s stalled projects and gave it a makeover in the form of   Duniya. As debutant director Hari’s   gets set for its date with audiences on Friday, the team behind its making, including producers   and his partners, Venkatesh Babu, Mahesh Siddaraju, Narayana Murthy and Chandrashekhar Patil, can heave a collective sigh of relief. The journey has not been easy, but the final product, says Siddaraju, will please audiences. 

 “My partners and I had been discussing about making a   together for a while, but weren’t finding the right script to go ahead. That is when my son, Yogi, suggested that we hear a narration from debutant director Hari, with whom he had started shooting for a film called Bazaar, which had, unfortunately got stalled. Yogi loved the story, so we were already convinced that it would appeal to us also. And it did, but we thought that we needed to give it a facelift to relaunch it. Considering that the film Duniya propelled Yogi into the limelight as Loose Mada, we wanted this project to be an extension to it and had even called it Duniya 2,” he explains. 
 
 With that in mind, the team gave Hari’s script a few cosmetic changes, in terms of more action and drama. “But we ran into title issues, which became a long-drawn court battle, and we eventually had to let go off it and settle for Yogi Duniya,” adds Siddaraju, who has made he film under his home banner, MY Film Factory, in association with Balaji cinema.
