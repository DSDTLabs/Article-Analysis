CHANDIGARH: To keep a clear head, examiners advise students to avoid   a day before the first Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) board examination on Thursday. Now that practicals are over, class XII (Indian School Certificate examination) students will start the mainstream theory exam with  

 Schools which have Class XII in the Tricity are Strawberry Field’s high school  , Mohali and St Xavier’s School, Chandigarh.
 
 “The students should just go for revisions hours before the exam and should be relaxed. Most importantly, they should avoid talking to their classmates about what they have studied and what they have left. Because if there is a topic they have missed while others have read, they will also start learning it. This will only waste their time as nothing can be learnt at the last moment,” said Naresh Handa, vice-principal, St Xavier’s School, Chandigarh.
 
  
 
 At Strawberry Fields, students follow the board pattern from junior class so that they are not overwhelmed in classes X and XII. “If we can help students get familiar with what is expected, it will automatically take the stress out of an exam. The gradual introduction to the exam pattern and set up allows students to work on their coping skills. 
 
 They are are trained systematically to sit for   by way of shorter weekly tests through the year, smaller duration exams in the siddle school (classes V-VII), a transition to Board pattern in grade VIII and final transition by classes IX-X. The question papers look the same as board papers,” said Shabnam, high school co-ordinator.
