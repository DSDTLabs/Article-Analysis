Panaji: Following the new avenues that this year’s state budget has opened for them, the directorate of agriculture is putting together a plan of action for commercial cultivation of mangoes. “We will attempt to cultivate mangoes in the high density technique. This involves less spacing of about five metres between the crops (which is otherwise 10m). This method will produce more yield of mangoes,” said agriculture director Ulhas Pai Kakode. Considering the potential of the mango crop to sustain the income of farmers, the government had proposed a scheme to promote mango cultivation in rocky areas by adopting modern techniques. “There is very good scope for cultivation of mangoes in the upper land and hilly terrains of Goa. Its success now depends on the proper implementation of this initiative and farmers’ will to take this up on a commercial level,” said president of Chodan-Madel farmers club, Premanand Mhambre. Ponda-based farmer, Jagganath Lawande said, “While the government is looking at commercial cultivation of mangoes in the state, efforts must also be made to protect the produce. Locals often steal our mangoes in the dead of night. While there are subsidies to provide fencing, monitoring every thief is beyond our control.” Mangoes are currently being planted in orchards in a scattered manner. Following the budget initiative, the department is attempting to cultivate the king of fruits on a commercial basis. Taluka-level zonal agriculture officers are in the process of identifying potential farmers who can take up mass cultivation of mangoes.
