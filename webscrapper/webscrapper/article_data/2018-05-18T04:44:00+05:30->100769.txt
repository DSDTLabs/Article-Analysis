Ahmedabad: The Gujarat government has decided to set up an eight-floor hostel to provide lodging and boarding facilities to encourage startups and innovation. The hostel will come up on the campus of the Knowledge Consortium of Gujarat (KCG), behind the LD College campus.

 An announcement to this effect was made by education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, at the launch of Student Startup and Innovation Policy (SSIP) Hub at the KCG. The minister also announced that students wanting to do research and form startups will be permitted to stay in the hostel and if required, the government will make arrangements for experts to provide technical expertise to resident innovators.
 
 Chudasama said, “I encourage the people in the audience to come up with solutions to address the scarcity of drinking water. An effective model for recycling water will be a great idea for a startup,” Chudasama said. The government has also decided to set up a web portal to provide duplicate results to students who were earlier diploma holders. Earlier, the diploma exam was held by the technical education board (TEB). Since 2008, these examinations are held by GTU. Hence, about four lakh students faced difficulties in getting their duplicate degrees and marksheets. The government has also decided to set up a web portal to approve training of professors.
