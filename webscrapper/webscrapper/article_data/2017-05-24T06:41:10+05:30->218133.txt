MADURAI:   have urged the state government to implement the scheme after   so that it covers both the rich and poor and act as a solution to the ongoing row between   

 Fishermen pointed out that   project should be implemented in letter and spirit. The trawl boat owners implementing this project to acquire tuna liners should not end up going into Sri Lankan waters again. “The state government should take a whole-hearted approach towards this scheme. Even as the boats are under construction, interested fishermen should be allowed to take out deep sea fishing in their trawlers thereby exposing them to the challenges,” said U Arulanandam, a fishermen activist at  . Stating that deep sea fishing requires specific skill set, he urged the government to ensure transparency in the scheme’s implementation. 
 
 President of country boat fishermen, G Arul said the scheme should be affordable to traditional fishermen too. “Traditional fishermen are poor and they will not be in a position to invest the beneficiary contribution. State government should allow group of country boat fishermen to pool money and consider their applications too,” he insisted.
 
 Arul also pointed out the challenges of fishermen in mobilizing bank loans for boats. “Banks will be reluctant to fund such risky endeavours of deep sea fishing crafts and we will be asked to pledge properties,” he pointed out.
