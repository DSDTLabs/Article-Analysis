CHENNAI: Two men in a car fled after pushing a police sub-inspector and dumping their bag carrying three knives inside a garbage bin near   on Monday night. 

 The men abandoned the car on   Third Street in   and escaped when the sub-inspector   tried to scan their faces with facial recognition software on his mobile phone to check if they were included in the state crime record bureau database.
 
 As Satish fell down on the road, he noticed them throwing a bag inside a garbage bin. Police recovered the car as well as the bags and have launched a hunt for the duo.
 
 Preliminary inquiries revealed that they may have come there to attack their rivals when police stopped them at a vehicle check point near Red Hills.
