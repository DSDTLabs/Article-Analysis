VADODARA: In the first major operation in the wholesale and retail fruit market in  , food safety officers of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( ) destroyed around 1,200kg of mangoes that were ripened artificially. A large quantity of ripeners were also seized during the operation.

 
 The use of artificial ripeners like ethylene ripener and calcium carbide is rampant during summer for mangoes. The practice has continued despite repeated advisories as well as raids by the VMC.

 Officials said that 18 godowns as well as 16 shops where mangoes had been stored were checked during the drive on Wednesday. It came to light that all these were ripening fruits artificially. The officials also found that 30kg of mangoes were not fit for consumption.
 
 By the end of the day, around 1,200kg mangoes were seized by the civic body. The stock was taken to the Jambuva landfill site of the civic body and disposed there.
 
 A VMC communique said that the vendors were asked to give an undertaking that they would not ripen fruits using artificial ripeners. This was done after instructions from the Gujarat high court.
