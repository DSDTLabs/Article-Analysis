DHANBAD: More than 25 thousand pilgrims from across the country and abroad are expected to participate in a   at the   of Parasnath, about 30 kilometres from the district headquarters at Giridih. 

 Unlike its traditional style across the nation, the Jain community is planning to turn the festival of colours into a ‘festival of flowers’ and ‘spirituality’ here. This festival will be mainly observed by the svetambar sect of the community, who often gather at Bhomiya Baba temple, to organise related events and perform spiritual activities.
 
 “Apart from celebrating the Holi festival, the devotees participate in night-long prayers, including bhajan and kirtan. They first celebrate Holi by applying ‘vermilion’ mixed with jasmine oil on the idol and sprinkle flowers on it. The following morning, they sprinkle flowers and apply abir, instead of colours on each other,” Anil Duggad, manager of   society said. 
 
 Duggad added that the Bhomiya Baba temple, apart from few other temples situated at the foothills atop Parasnath hills, will be decorated with lights and flowers for the festival.
 
 The auspicious Holi night is also considered as the birth anniversary of ‘Bhomiya Baba’, one of the important deities of the community. 
 
 “A total of 15,000 to 20,000 devotees from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Kolkata, Maharashtra and other areas have arrived to participate in the activities here. The functions will start Sunday morning. “The manner in which they collect flower petals and mixed them with abir to sprinkle on each other is itself unique,”  , senior representative of Jain Swetambar society, said.
