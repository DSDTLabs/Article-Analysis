BENGALURU: Two employees of a cash logistics firm CMS, who fled with Rs 90 lakh cash on Tuesday, are still at large.

 Driver  , 45 and cash loader  , 28, had sped away with the van after asking the gunman to buy bananas in southwest Bengaluru. They had to refill cash for ATMs in the area. The vehicle was later found abandoned on the outskirts of Bengaluru.
 
 Jnanabharathi police, who registered a case of servant theft, said they’re unable to trace the suspects and have no clue of their whereabouts. The accused are neither using mobile phones nor contacting their families.
 
 
 
 
 Syndicate Bank clarified that it has not engaged CMS to either collect cash from its branches or refill money in its ATMs. The TOI report, ‘ATM cash van driver and colleague escape with Rs 90 lakh’ (January 31) had said the van had collected money from Syndicate Bank branches, among others.
