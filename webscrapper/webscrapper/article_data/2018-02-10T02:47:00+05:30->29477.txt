Vijayawada: On behalf of the state government, the tourism department has come up with a programme for ‘remembering the food culture of the past’, said Murali Krishna, director at industry development group, AP Tourism.

 Krishna participated in the inauguration event of “Andhra Cuisine Food Festival”, organised by the AP Tourism Authority, here at Hotel Fortune Murali Park. 
 
 The programme will be conducted from February 9 to 15. The coffee shop at the hotel was decorated with flower petals and painted pots to represent the Andhra culture.
 
 The director said the programme is also about reconnecting ourselves with the past. “The food, cooked by our grandmothers, was famously cherished in the olden days. It has been forgotten in these times, and by preparing food like in the olden-days, the programme allows people to taste the traditional food,” he said. “People will also be encouraged to cook the food at their homes,” he said. 
 
 The AP Tourism has been inviting investors in various sectors, Krishna said. TNN
