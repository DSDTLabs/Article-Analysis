 Hundreds of trained home guards from various districts of the state, along with Special Police Officer (SPO) personnel, assembled at Dispur here on Monday morning and started raising slogans against the state government for its constant apathy towards them. It may be mentioned here that these security personnel have been serving without regular jobs and satisfactory payment for a long time.

 Demanding regularization of their jobs, the SPOs alleged that the state government was indifferent to their woes and threatened to intensify their agitation if their demands are not fulfilled. "We demand the state government to come up with a solution within a week or our protesters will block all highways and railway tracks. If necessary, SPOs will go for self-immolation," the SPOs cried in unison.
 
 The state government had faced a tricky situation in 2015 when armed SPOs, during a protest in   district, allegedly opened fire on state police personnel who were trying to obstruct them. Two policemen had sustained bullet injuries. Later, the SPOs laid down arms after the state government promised to look into their demands.
 
 The Assam government had raised the SPOs in 2008 to guard government officials and vital installations after Karbi militants triggered large-scale violence. Many surrendered ultras were also inducted into the squad under rehabilitation schemes.
