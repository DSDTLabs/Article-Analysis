Panaji: The only CD4 machine that was sent to Goa Medical College (GMC) by the National AIDS Control Organization has been experiencing frequent breakdowns and has been defunct since November 2016 with the maintenance agency contracted by NACO, based in Delhi, is unable to repair it. The Cluster of Differentiation (CD4) test determines the immune system status of a patient and is the mark for medical officers to determine if a person living with HIV should be put on Antiretroviral therapy (ART) or not. Peter Borges, convener of the Goa State NGO Forum on HIV/AIDS has highlighted the status of the machine before the Goa State Human Rights Commission, requesting it to intervene in safeguarding the right to health of people living with HIV. Borges has asked the commission to direct the Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS), Directorate of Health Services and National AIDS Control Organization to repair the CD4 machine or make an alternative arrangement for conduct of such tests for those who are due since November 2016. He also asked for a ‘Viral load test machine’ that checks the amount of virus presently in a person’s system as that will reduce the pressure on the current CD4 machine. As a result of the defunct machine, ART doctors in Goa are now reportedly handing out treatment based on judgment instead of tests, the task of prevention and control of HIV in Goa is not becoming a greater burden. People in charge of the CD4 machine at GMC have made several pleas to GSACS and NACO too. The GSHRC has given four weeks to the project director of Goa State AIDS Control Society, the Directorate of Health Services and the National AIDS Control Organization to submit a report.
