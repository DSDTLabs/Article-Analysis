PUNE: Tender coconut is not going to be kind on your pocket this summer.

 With the supply of   drying up from the southern states, its   have shot up by Rs 5 to Rs 10 per unit in Pune’s open market, depending upon the area.
 
 Now, each unit is being sold at Rs 35 to Rs 40 in different parts of the city against previous price of Rs 30.
 
 As per a report of the   (CDB), Kochi, a statutory body under the Ministry of Agriculture, the production of tender coconut has dropped by 6.2 % in the country this year when compared to the last year, a top source told TOI.
 
 Speaking to TOI over the phone, Sardarsingh Choyal, deputy director (technical) CDB, said, “Due to the scanty rainfall in southern states this year, especially Tamil Nadu, the overall production of the tender coconut has been affected. Eventually, it has disturbed the demand and supply equation in all markets across the country.”
 
 Choyal said the demand for tender coconut is increasing every year. “As the tender coconut has medicinal values, the demand for coconuts is on the   in the market,” he added.
 
 As per the sources in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune, the market here gets around 15 truckloads of tender coconuts daily. “However, it has dropped to just five truckloads daily this year,” they added.
 
 “The vendors are not getting enough coconuts in the market as the demand has already gone up owing to the summer heat, resulting in price rise,” the sources said.
 
 APMC officials said the situation is expected to remain the same at least for next three months. “The prices are not expected to fall in the summer months. Once the monsoon starts, the price correction will happen as the demand will come down automatically,” they added.
 
 A coconut vendor operating in the Range Hills area of Khadki said, “I am buying 100 coconuts for Rs 3,000 in the market. Considering the buying price, I cannot it at Rs 30 per piece to customers.”
