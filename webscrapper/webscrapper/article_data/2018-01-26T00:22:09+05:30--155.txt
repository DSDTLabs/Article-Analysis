MUMBAI: After a poor response from private   here, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has extended the deadline for registrations for online Right To Education ( ) Act   up to January 30. 

  which conducts the online admission process, had set the deadline for January 25 but only 200 schools registered. Last year, almost 350 schools registered. 
 
 But schools which have registered too have said they will not admit students under the RTE quota unless the state clears dues of past admissions. “The government should first clear dues or we will not take in students allotted to us, and this will only create further problems,” said a school management representative. 
 
 Several school management associations have got together to protest non-payment of dues and are boycotting admissions. 
 
 BMC will also use school data from last year to re-register schools. “Many of our schools received notices from the department for derecognition, and we replied that we will not register until the court’s next hearing on February 23. In case they use data from last year and register us anyway, we will not admit students. The state is intentionally creating disharmony,” said Rajendra Singh from Independent English Schools’ Association. 
 
 Parent representatives felt the tussle will largely affect students. “The RTE quota gave many children admissions to private schools. But if the schools do not get money from the state, what will happen to the future of students admitted under the quota? The schools may either ask them to leave or burden parents of other 75% students. Teachers too are worried that the additional financial burden will eat into their incentives,” said Arundhati Chavan, president of the forum.
