BHOPAL: Police have finally slapped Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) against warden of government residential bridging school,  , under pressure from child rights groups and parents in a sexual abuse case of 24 children in the age group of six to 11 years.

 The warden,  , was accused of sexually abusing children living there. He was also charged with touching them inappropriately and clicking their obscene pictures. Section 9/10 and section 11/12 of POCSO Act (sexual assault and harassment) were added to the existing FIR on January 14, 2017, but the women’s commission was informed about it on Thursday, the last day of public hearing by the   (NCW). However, the accused has not been arrested so far and is said to be on the run.
 
 Meanwhile, Child Rights Alliance and parents of victims once again protested against the fact that police have tampered with the statements of children and are not ready to include the fact that children were also shown these obscene videos repeatedly by the accused. “Section 13 should also be added. We are happy that police agreed to the fact that children were sexual abused. But, we again requested them to add one more section, which makes the case complete and arrest the warden who is roaming around in Bairagarh. Police, however, is saying that he is out of station,” said   from Muskaan and member of Child Rights Alliance.
 
 The incident was reported to police on December 2 last year. Police had then refused to register the FIR despite the fact that 18 students reached police station themselves to get their statements recorded. Police lodged the FIR after Child Rights Alliance and the victims’ parents mounted pressure on them.
