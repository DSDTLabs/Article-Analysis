KANYAKUMARI: Three-and-a-half months since his detention by the Iranian  , 46-year-old fisherman M Maria Thomas   of Tuticorin district will be returning to Tamil Nadu safely on Wednesday morning. He was among the 15 Indian fishermen – eight from Kanyakumari district, five from Tirunelveli and two from Tuticorin – detained on October 24.

 The fishermen were working for an employer in Dubai and went fishing in two boats on October 22. They accidentally entered the Iranian waters on October 24, when they were detained and were taken to Kish Island in  , where they have been lodged till date. Over the days Craslin and J Viniston, 49 of   in Kanyakumari district, fell ill.
 
 Last week Craslin suffered from chest pain and pressure and was often taken to hospital. On February 1, he also recorded a nearly 90 second video message in which he made an appeal to the Prime Minister and chief minister of Tamil Nadu to take steps to help him return home as his health was deteriorating.
 
 “They are taking me to the hospital and bringing me back on and off. I don’t know if I will be able to see my wife and children. I am afraid that I will die here,” he said in the video. Meanwhile, their employer paid the fines for the fishermen, despite which all of them evinced interest to return home.
 
 President of International Fishermen Development Trust, P Justin Antony, who has been following the issue since their detention, told TOI on Tuesday that Amit, an Indian embassy officer from Bandar Abbas, Iran, met the fishermen on Monday and told them that Craslin would be returning home. “We informed his wife Sunitha who is overjoyed over his release,” he said.
 
 He said that Craslin will fly from Iran to Dubai on Tuesday night and from there to Chennai early on Wednesday morning. 
 
 Thanking the authorities who have taken steps for the safe return of Craslin, Antony appealed to the ministry of external affairs to help the remaining 14 fishermen return home.
