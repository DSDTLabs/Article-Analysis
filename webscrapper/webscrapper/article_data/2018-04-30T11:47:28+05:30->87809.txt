 As per the plan, the trio booked an Uber cab from Langar Houz at 9.30pm on April 24. After the cab reached Tholkatta area, the trio threatened the driver, B Mallaiah (48) with a knife and deboarded him. In his complaint, Mallaiah said the trio — in their mid-twenties, stopped the car near Tholkatta gate at 10.30pm and necked him out of the vehicle by pointing a knife at him.
 
 The offenders then sped away in his Swift Dzire cab. As the victim’s phone was in the car’s glove compartment, he took help from the locals and reached the police station to lodge a complaint. A robbery case was registered under Section 392 of IPC on April 25.
 
 TIMES VIEW: Police should increase patrolling to stop carjacking cases. A probe must be ordered to check whether these are gangs targetting cabbies in deserted areas and they must be brought to justice.
