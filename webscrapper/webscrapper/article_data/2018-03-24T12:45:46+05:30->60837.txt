HYDERABAD: Emboldened by the Hyderabad High Court’s order, 50 women have applied for the posts of power lineman in   contending that they have no fear of climbing electric poles and fixing problems.

 It was on this very premise that they cannot climb electric poles, power utilities had not considered women for the posts of lineman all these years. “We received the High Court order and honouring that, we accepted applications from women for the first time. As it is an interim order, we will wait for the final order. But, in the meantime, these women can appear for the written examination,” A  , chairman and managing director of northern discom, told TOI.
 
 The discom officials, who are still sceptical over the pole climbing abilities of women, wanted the court to give a clear direction. They pointed out that a physically demanding job like lineman is not an easy one, particularly in the rural areas where power supply could go off in night and at odd times.
 
 The matter was challenged in the High Court, which held last week that women too should be considered for the posts as long as they satisfy the required qualifications. After their applications were rejected, seven women from   had approached the court and got the interim order.   and others, who knocked the doors of the court, are believed to be practising pole climbing ahead of the written exam.
 
 There are 2,553 lineman posts, which will be filled by the northern power distribution company.
