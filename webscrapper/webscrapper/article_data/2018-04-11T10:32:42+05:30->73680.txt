TRICHY: DMK working president M K Stalin on Tuesday said opposition leaders would meet Tamil Nadu governor   on April 13 to express concerns regarding the Cauvery issue and put pressure on the Centre to implement the SC order.

 Stalin said the governor’s office has confirmed the appointment. Opposition leaders would take out a car rally from Cuddalore to Raj Bhavan after the culmination of the Cauvery padayatra, he said. They would meet the governor at 12.30 pm on Friday. He was speaking during his padayatra in Tiruvarur district. Stalin also rode a bullock cart during the padayatra on Tuesday.
 
 Stalin charged that   was running a spineless government. It was not able to even get an appointment for an all-party delegation from Tamil Nadu to meet Prime Minister  , he said. Reacting to Union minister of state for shipping Pon Radhakrishnan’s statement that neither the CM nor the deputy CM had sought an appointment with the PM for the all-party delegation to meet him, Stalin said either Palaniswami should repudiate   or he should resign as CM. He said it needed to be clarified as to who, whether EPS or Pon Radhakrishnan, is bluffing.
