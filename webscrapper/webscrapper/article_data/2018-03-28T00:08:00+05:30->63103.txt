CHENNAI: Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s personal security officer (PSO) Veeraperumal deposed before the Justice (retd) Arumughaswamy commission on Tuesday. A member of V K Sasikala’s legal team who was present during the deposition told reporters later that Veeraperumal had accepted seeing Jayalalithaa when she was in the hospital.

 This matches with what Sasikala had submitted before the commission in her affidavit, the member of her legal team told reporters.
 
 Two witnesses who have deposed before the commission will be cross-examined by Sasikala’s legal team on Wednesday while the rest will be cross-examined on April 6 and 7, said Raja Senthoor Pandian, Sasikala’s legal counsel.
 
 Responding to questions, Pandian said he had asked for cross-examination of some government officials but said the details would emerge later.
 
 To a question if Sasikala had mentioned anything about chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami seeing Jayalalithaa in the hospital, Pandian said there was not anything to that effect. He also confirmed the details that have emerged in various news reports regarding the finer details of Sasikala’s affidavit.
