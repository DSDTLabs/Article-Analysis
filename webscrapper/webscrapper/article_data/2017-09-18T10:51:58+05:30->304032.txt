NEW DELHI:   has started taking a relook at the National Democratic Alliance’s electoral prospects and its own strategies in Bihar for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, with the political situation now more in its favour with chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) returning to the   fold.
 
  BJP president   has informed the party’s Bihar unit that he would visit the state either in the first week or the third week of November, sources said. Shah is expected to stay in the state for three days in order to review the progress in the party’s expansion plan at the booth level in all the 40 Lok Sabha constituencies.
  
  “Initially, he was supposed to come to Bihar in September. His plan now got changed and thus he held a meeting with the party’s core committee, which handles BJP’s affairs in Bihar, in New Delhi two days back,” a BJP insider said. Shah is closely tracking party affairs in Bihar and is very clear in his stand that BJP’s plan for expanding its base at the booth level must not be affected in the new political situation, insiders said.
  
  
  
  
  
  “Since he saw a good chance for the NDA to win all the 40 LS seats in Bihar in the 2019 polls after Bihar CM Nitish’s return to the NDA fold, his special emphasis is on BJP’s strength at the booth level. He collected feedback about such booths which are still to be touched by the party,” one of the people who attended Shah’s recent meeting with Bihar leaders told ET. “He also reviewed the progress of the ‘Mahasampark Abhiyan’ launched by BJP’s Bihar unit at the booth level,” the person said.
  
  Shah wants the party’s state unit to ensure proper publicity of the central government’s various schemes. “He wants to develop the improved relation between the Centre and the state in the changed political situation as a potential issue for the coming  ,” another source said.
