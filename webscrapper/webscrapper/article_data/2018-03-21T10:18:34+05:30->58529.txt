The colleges granted autonomy will also be free to set their own syllabus, hold examinations, carry out evaluation as well as declare results. In this case, only the degree will be awarded by the respective university. 

  
  
  
 
 The minister also said that a show-cause notice will be given to three deemed universities which are lacking in quality.
 
 Union human resource Development minister Prakash Javadekar hailed as "historic" the   move which will enable the selected institutes to decide their admission procedure, fee structure and curriculum, among others.
 
 "Today is a historic day for higher education in India. These quality institutions will get complete autonomy by which they can start new courses, new departments, new programmes, off-campuses and courses on skills, research parks, appoint foreign faculty, take foreign students, offer variable incentive packages, introduce online distance learning," Javadekar said.
 
 The HRD minister said that selected universities will not have to come to the regulator repeatedly to seek permission because they have maintained quality and achieved a benchmark of 3.26 and above in   ranking.
 
 The central universities include   (JNU),   (AMU), Banaras Hindu University (BHU),   and English and Foreign Languages University, Telangana.
 
 The state varsities include Jadhavpur University, Andhra University, Algappa University, National University of Law, Utkal University, Kurukshetra University, Osmania University, Guru Nanak Dev University, University of Jammu, University of Mysore, Anna University, Punjab University and  , among others. 
 
 The 10 colleges which have been granted autonomy will have full freedom but not degree awarding powers, Javadekar said.
