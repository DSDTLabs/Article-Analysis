NAGPUR: Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited ( ) has, for the first time, been assigned three new infrastructure projects that are outside of Metro rail corridors. Union minister and city MP Nitin Gadkari assigned the projects to make Metro rail more feasible.

 The MahaMetro has already planned to execute 13 infrastructure projects on its two corridors — Pardi to Hingna Mount View and   to Khapri.
 
 Gadkari held meeting with the officials of MahaMetro at his residence at   on Saturday. MahaMetro MD Brijesh Dixit, director (projects) Mahesh Kumar and others were present during the meeting.
 
 Three new projects assigned to MahaMetro include four-storeyed multi-modal stadium on the lands covering Yeshwant Stadium, government library, city buses parking area and Patrakar Bhavan at Dhantoli. Double decker flyovers between Ramjhula-Railway Station and Kasturchand Park (KP) and waterway at Ambazari lake have also been planned.
 
 Gadkari had already announced multi-modal stadium at Dhantoli. The two other projects are new ones announced on Saturday.
 
 Sources from Mahametro told TOI that Gadkari directed the MahaMetro to prepare detailed project report (DPR) and feasibility report of the three projects at the earliest. 
 
 “It seems likely that MahaMetro will be assigned work of demolition of flyover situated in front of Railway Station after the proposal gets clearance from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). A study to decide on the fate of flyover is underway. MahaMetro had suggested to build the new flyovers for easing congestion on two roads—KP to   and Jaistambh Square to Manas Square. MahaMetro is also likely to be assigned work of development of land between Railway Station and Manas Square,” sources said.
 
 Sources added that Gadkari asked the MahaMetro to take up multi-modal stadium as the project will have high commercial potential. “MahaMetro also asked to connect the proposed project with Metro rail inter-change coming up at Munje Square through skywalk and underground tunnel. It will be second infrastructure project in the area as the MahaMetro is also constructing transit management centre (TTMC) opposite Yeshwant Stadium that will have a 25-storeyed tower and two 19-storeyed towers,” the sources said.
 
 Gadkari directed the MahaMetro to develop waterway in Ambazari lake. Plan is to engage boats for connectivity between Takli Sim, Subhash Nagar, Ambazari Layout, Hingna MIDC, Ambazari Garden etc through waterway. The MahaMetro is also planning to build an amusement park after demolishing Krazy Castle.
 
 Sources also said that MahaMetro proposed a few more such projects in the other parts of the city and out of Metro rail corridors for earning additional revenue to make operation and maintenance of Metro rail feasible.
