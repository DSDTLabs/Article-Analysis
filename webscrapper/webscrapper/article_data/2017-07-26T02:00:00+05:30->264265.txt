PATNA: Tomato and capsicum selling at Rs 80-100/kg, ladies’ finger at Rs 30/kg and pointed gourd at Rs 40/kg — that’s veggie market scenario in Patna. Worse, vendors say, the prices will continue to soar in days to come as the supplies have reduced due to the monsoon. Sources said most of the green vegetables come to the city from Sonepur and Tajpur. These vegetables are mostly grown by the riverside, and the rising Ganga level due to the rains has adversely hit their production.  “Tomato is supplied to Patna during the monsoon season from Bangalore and Nepal, while capsicum is supplied from Shimla and Nasik. The transportation cost adds to their price,” said a trader on Tuesday.  Vendors also claim 25% of the consignment gets damaged during transportation from the wholesalers to the market. Unavailability of cold storage to most of the vegetable wholesalers also contributes to stock loss. “Needless to say, these losses are passed on to retail buyers,” explained a wholesaler. The soaring prices have hurt not only the buyers but also retail vendors. “Prices of almost all the vegetables have gone by at least Rs 10/kg, forcing people to buy less quantity,” Antaghat vendor Lallan Kumar said. Till June, pointed gourd (parwal) and sponge gourd (nenua) were sold in retail for Rs 10/kg. With the advent of monsoon, their prices have skyrocketed to Rs 40/kg. The prices of cauliflower, cabbage, brinjal and ladies’ finger have nearly doubled after June. According to Gardanibagh resident Urmila Singh, she now pays Rs 250 to 300 for the same vegetables which she would buy for Rs 150 twice a week till June. “My vendors used to give green chillies and coriander leaves complimentary... Now, these cost me Rs 10-20/100 gram,” she said. The meteorological department has predicted active rainfall throughout the state over the week.
