MUMBAI:   and   allegedly attacked   and civic officials who tried to stop them from defecating in the open at Juhu-Tara beach in Santacruz (W) on Thursday. They summoned around 40 of their supporters from nearby areas and accused   of snatching their rights.

 BMC is conducting a special drive, promoted by actor Salman Khan, to make the city open defecation-free. Last month, BMC had written to the Railways, Aarey authorities and salt pan owners to allow it to set up toilets so that slum-dwellers should not   in the open. But it found that many avoided the mobile toilets.
 
 Civic officials decided to use clean-up marshals to help them. During one such drive, they went to Juhu-Tara beach around 6.30am on Thursday to stop people from defecating, when some kolis allegedly got aggressive. The marshals summoned other civic staff to the spot, so the kolis got their supporters and slum-dwellers from nearby areas. The crowd claimed that they were original habitants of the area and attacked two civic staffers with a stick.
 
 The civic staff left the spot and reported the incident to Santacruz police. The cops registered an FIR against three persons, including a woman, for assaulting civic staff and stopping public servants from performing their duties.
 
 Civic officials said there are many mobile toilets in Khar Danda and slums near Juhu-Tara beach, despite which many people living there were not using them and defecating on the beach.
