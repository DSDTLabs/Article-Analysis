NEW DELHI: The Cabinet approved on Wednesday transfer of 34.87 hectares of   to the   for setting of a new diplomatic enclave. This will be used for accommodating foreign missions and international organisations. 

 At present, Delhi’s   is Chankyapuri, which was developed in two phases between 1949 and 1953. “After getting the land, the land development office will lay the trunk infrastructure. Then plotting will be done and these will be allotted based on recommendations of the external affairs ministry,” said an urban development ministry official.
 
 The new diplomatic enclave in Sector 24 Dwarka will be nearly one-tenth the size of   diplomatic area. In 1949, the government had first earmarked 328 hectares in Central Delhi and land was allotted to 55 missions and embassies. Subsequently, in 1953, another 132 hectares was earmarked to accommodate another 21 missions. Out of the total 460 hectares, only about 143 hectares were allotted to embassies and foreign missions. 
 
 Sources said over 90% of the area approved for the new diplomatic enclave is encumbrance-free and development can start quickly.
 
 According to reports nearly three dozen countries operate from rented properties in South Delhi. The enclave will meet their requirement and its proximity to the international airport will make it attractive.
 
 Realising the need for such an area, the Delhi Master Plan has already earmarked the land for this purpose. The proposal was first mooted nearly nine years back. There were reports that   and foreign affairs ministry were at loggerheads over the issue of ground rent. The foreign ministry had reportedly demanded waiving off ground rent and to keep property rates unchanged for two years.
 
 “Now all issues have been put to rest. The DDA will hand over the land to land and development office at Re 1,” said an official.
