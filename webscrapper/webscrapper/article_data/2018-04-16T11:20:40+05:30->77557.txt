 That poker is a game that rewards skill isnâ€™t questioned among serious scholars. However, poker can also teach individuals some incredibly valuable skills. Scholars studying poker have used many different approaches, but consistently find that poker is a game that requires significant skill. University of Chicago researchers studied results from the biggest annual poker competition, the World Series of Poker. They found that highly skilled players had a return on investment (ROI) of over 30 percent, whereas other players had a negative ROI of 15 percent. Given that no amount of studying would help win a game of luck like the lottery, this provides evidence that poker is a game predominantly based on skill. 
 
 Poker in India is also on the onset of breaking its set image with institutes like IIM (Kozhikode) taking specialised courses on Poker & giving interested players access to roughly 10,856 books developed on poker strategy.
 
 PSL is the brainchild of  , Mr. Anuj Gupta and Mr. Pranav Bagai which was established last year, with a mission to establish poker as a sport in the country. "  has an exciting line up of players & we are certain that like last time, we will be able to execute it at par with any international format. Poker Sports League in mere 2 seasons has managed to create its mark in the sports arena & the day isn't too far, when it will become the most sought after leagues in the country. We have announced 11 teams & we are certain that the most skilled team will emerge as champions, as Poker is purely a mind game & there's no stance of chance overriding the former," Amit Burman, Vice Chairman, Dabur, said.
