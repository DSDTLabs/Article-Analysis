NEW DELHI: In an attempt to prevent the risk of importation of polio from a few countries,   launched the pulse polio programme for 2017 by administering   on Saturday to children below five years at the  .

 The programme will cover 17 crore children aged under five years to maintain the country's 'polio-free' status.
 
 Mukherjee launched the countrywide programme on the eve of the National Immunisation Day. Health Minister J P Nadda and Ministers of State for Health Anupriya Patel and Faggan Singh Kulaste were present during the event.
 
 “As the risk of importation remains from remaining three countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria) where polio virus is still circulating, the need still persists for the country to maintain the population immunity and sensitive surveillance till global polio eradication happens,” Nadda said.
 
 He said the polio-free certification of the entire South-East Asia Region of World Health Organisation, including India, on March 27, 2014 is a “huge” accomplishment in the history of public health.
 
 Noting that immunisation is one of the key interventions in reducing child deaths in country, he said to expand its scope in country, Rotavirus virus vaccine was introduced as part of the Universal Immunisation programme (UIP) last year.
 
 “The ministry will soon introduce Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine that will help reduce the burden of diaorrhea, pneumonia and meningitis and (launch) a countrywide campaign with Measles-Rubella vaccine in phased manner,” Nadda said.
 
 Nadda said the government is conducting continuous polio vaccination at the international borders with India and a travel advisory has also been issued to vaccinate all travellers between India and eight other countries.
 
 “Also, an   and   (EPRP) is in place under which Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have been formed in all states and UTs to respond urgently to any importations of polio virus,” Nadda said.
