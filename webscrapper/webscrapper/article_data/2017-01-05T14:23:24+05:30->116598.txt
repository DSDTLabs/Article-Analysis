NEW DELHI: The first two phases of   in   may decide the fate of the polls in the most populous and politically crucial state, as any polarisation in the western part — as seen during the 2014   — may help the   get an impressive tally.
 
  The EC has decided to hold polls in 73 and 67 seats of western UP in the first and second phase respectively. This includes districts like  ,  ,  ,   and   where votes are likely to be polarised in the wake of communal incidents since 2012.
  
  If there is a redux of the Lok Sabha polls, where polarisation in the first phase (April 10, 2014) of polling had set the stage for   to get an unprecedented 71 seats, it will give the saffron party a big boost. However, the Muslim voters are likely to be more tactical this time and not allow any division of the community votes after their 2014 experience.
  
  The third phase will cover the Mainpuri-Etawah belt that is SP stronghold, but it is not clear how the family feud will affect its prospects in its pocket-borough. The fourth phase will see BSP and SP fighting for votes with BJP having influence in some seats. While BJP will be in a contest with BSP in the fifth phase, the last two phases may again get BJP a sizable number of seats. However, SP has a strong presence in some of these constituencies and its tie-up with Mukhtar Ansari’s party will help it in the Azamgarh-Mau belt.
