THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the Thiruvananthapuram District   Bank turning out to be the only one among the 14 district cooperative banks to incur losses in the last fiscal, the state cooperation department has decided to set up a special team to probe into the ‘financial mismanagement’ by the bank.

 
 
  
 
 A preliminary assessment has already pointed out that the bank suffered losses as it used to flout norms and disburse loans to even ‘bogus primary cooperative societies’ during the tenure of the previous administrative committee, cooperation minister Kadakampally   said on Thursday.
 
 A team headed by the registrar of cooperative societies and the audit director will examine all accounts and transactions made from the beginning of previous administration’s tenure till March 31, 2018. Stringent action will be taken against those responsible after the probe has been completed, the minister said.
 
 “Out of the loans given to primary societies, Rs 254 crore turned into non-performing asset (NPA), and several of the primary societies were found to be bogus. The bank also has an NPA of Rs 500 crore disbursed as loans to individuals,” Surendran said adding that probe will be ordered into ‘similar transactions’ detected in Thrissur District Cooperative Bank as well. However, the government has taken necessary measures aimed at resolution of the stressed assets of the Thiruvananthapuram District Cooperative Bank ahead of formation of the  . The government has already infused a capital of Rs 22 crore, he said.
 
 The Kerala Bank is expected to become a reality this fiscal itself, Surendran said. The only requisite remaining was the RBI’s approval for amalgamation, and the government was expecting to receive it before March 31, 2018. “There are no hitches, and the RBI has taken a very positive approach towards the proposed Kerala Bank,” he said.
