If there’s one thing that’s got   D’Cruz excited about 'Mubarakan' other than its script, her role or sharing screen space with   and  , it’s the dance numbers! She says, “There are some foot-tapping tracks in the film and I loved dancing to them all. I was so happy that I could finally dance because I didn’t get a chance to do it in Rustom.”

 Interestingly, Ileana is one of those few actresses who has a song to her name. Point this out to her and she laughs, “My name is part of a song in one of my Kannada films. And then, ‘Ileana’ featured in Shankar’s   — Irukana. While shooting for the song, he played the number and asked me to listen to it carefully. When I heard my name, I was quite surprised. He then explained the lyrics to me. It was crazy to dance to a song, the lyrics of which has your name.”
