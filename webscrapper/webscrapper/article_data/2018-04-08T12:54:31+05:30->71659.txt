His father   is known for penning songs like ' ', ' ' and ' '. Now, Farzan Faaiz is out to carve his own niche as a composer after working on two songs for the movie ' '.

 Expectations run high with a father with a flair as natural as Faaiz Anwar has. Farzan said it's obvious that if he wanted to be a lyricist, his father would have helped me a lot, but he chose a different path.
 
 "I never paid attention to writing. Writing lyrics need a lot of concentration and deep thinking. My father never forced me for anything. Fortunately he was the one who encouraged me into music when he saw me playing guitar.
 
 "He has worked with great music composers like  ,  ,   and his vast experience has helped me a lot to nurture my skills," Farzan said in a statement.
 
 He composed two songs for 'Veerey Ki Wedding' -- 'Mindblowing' and 'Na kasoor'.
 
 Commenting on the trend of filmmakers choosing multiple composers for one film as opposed to a solo music composer, Farzan said, "Everything has pros and cons. It is always easier for a solo music composer to get recognised as compared to the composer who has one or two songs in a movie.
 
 "But if you are giving your best, one song is enough for you. My two songs 'Mindblowing', sung by Mika Singh, and 'Na kasoor', sung by Javed Ali, has struck chord among the listeners."
 
 He is especially happy about the success of 'Mindblowing' as he worked hard for it and he feels it 'paid off'.
 
 Farzan is also interested in singing.
 
 "I love singing and I am taking singing lessons to improve my vocals skills and music," said the composer, who is now working on some film songs, besides a few singles too.
