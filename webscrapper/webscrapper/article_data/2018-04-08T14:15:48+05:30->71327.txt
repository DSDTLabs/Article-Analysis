VIJAYAWADA: There has been a substantial increase in the   rate of Krishna district. Consequently, a drop in admissions at orphanages has also been recorded.

 Krishna is the state's sole district with two child welfare department-funded adoption centres.
 
 Speaking to TOI, project director of women and child welfare department Krishna   said they are receiving a lot of applications through   ( ) website. “As far as Krishna district is concerned, there has been a tremendous increase in the adoption of girl children compared to boys,” Kumari said.
 
 Kumari admitted that in the past, couples preferred male children when it came to adoption due to the cultural belief of males being rightful heirs. However, the discrimination of female children over males still exists -- which manifests in felonious practices such as infanticide and abandoning of children.
 
 “Most of the children from our adoption centres are the ones we rescued from tough situations like abandoned on the roadside or rescued from trafficking. In many cases, biological parents hand over their newborn babies to us,” Kumari added. 
 
 According to department sources, the biological mothers deem the child as ‘unwanted’ for different reasons like pre-marital pregnancy, extra-marital affairs or family disputes. Applicants from Krishna district also seek to adopt children from other states through CARA as well. Kumari also did not rule out instances of parents leaving their children due to poverty. 
 
 Guntur is one such district where girl child abandonment has been rampant. Around four such incidents have been reported recently where kids were found dumped in garbage bins or roadside bushes.
 
 Meanwhile, Guntur officials this trend has risen of late.
