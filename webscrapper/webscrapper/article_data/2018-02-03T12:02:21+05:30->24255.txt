PUNE: Along with three other classmates, Parisian Martin Rebufello, an art direction student of the French film school La Femis, had to make a choice about their exercise at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII).

 “We had to create two sets depicting a rural and an urban location. But we had a decision to make regarding the country to showcase in each of the sets, choosing between India and France,” Rebufello recalled. He is here on a student exchange programme along with batch mates Luce Jalbert, Valentine Fell, and  .
 
 Eventually the team settled for a wada, common in the older parts of Pune, for their urban set and a French motel. Rebufello and Jalbert worked on the wada, while the rest worked on the motel.
 
 “We had to go around the city and look for a wada that could be recreated. We photographed the wall patterns, texture of the walls, wooden doors, arches, and the typical courtyard. Though we cannot recreate the stone flooring, we are trying our best to reflect the pattern,” said Jalbert.
 
 The students have made a scaled-down cardboard model of the wada and, barring a few adjustments, stuck by it to the inch. As the set neared completion, it almost felt as if a cross-section of a wada was picked out and placed inside the Prabhat studio.
 
 Using cloth, plywood, wooden panels, resin, and other effects Rebufello and Jalbert put up the set in collaboration with FTII designers. “These sets are not just for their exercise. We will reuse the sets for the cinematography exercise,” said Prasad Thorat, assistant professor of art direction.
 
 As far as design philosophies go, the French motel designed by Fell and Biard could not be more different than the wada. The cubist design, minimalist decoration, and a sense of space was a marked departure from the intensive space use in the wada set. “What I learnt was that Indian and   is vastly different. We focus on straight lines and right angles,” remarked Biard.
