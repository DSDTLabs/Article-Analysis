 A police officer, who is a part of investigation, said, “Pravin and his friend were going in a car on   highway on April 20 night. Suddenly, they heard a big blast like sound. Immediately, Bariya received a call on his mobile demanding money.”
 
 “This time your life was saved, but you won’t be lucky every time and it won’t take me much time to kill you and your family,” the caller told Bariya.
 
 The investigation has been handed over to police inspector, Morbi special operations group (SOG), Salim Sati.
