 McCarthy was on the bitter end of some especially vicious hate when she starred in the 2016 all-female   reboot alongside  ,   and  . 
 
 McCarthy said, "Weirdly, instead of getting mad at them, I always feel like, 'Oh, I hope you meet someone soon that you can talk to, someone that really makes you laugh'. I just root for that person to find a little joy. I'm never going to change things by sitting in my living room bawling. That's not going to fix or help anything. This has been a tough chunk of history for women."
 
 "But at one point I just said, 'I'm not going to wallow in this anymore.' It's not my reality-the men I know wouldn't act like this. So I look to the men I know, who have made my life better, and I just keep remembering that they're the norm."
