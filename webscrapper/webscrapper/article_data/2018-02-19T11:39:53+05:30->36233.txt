MYSURU: None too pleased with a statement made by Prime Minister   about how youngsters selling pakodas too had jobs, members of the   (UoM) Students’ Federation said that the PM had not lived up to his pre-poll promise of generating jobs for youngsters.

 Stating that PM Modi should become the brand ambassador for pakodas and bajjis ay the global level, the students staged a protest at Manasagangotri – the UoM’s postgraduate campus. “Instead of creating jobs, PM Modi is telling youngsters to prepare pakodas, and earn Rs 200 a day, which shows his concerns towards unemployed youngsters,” the protesters said.
 
 As a gesture of protest, the members of the student body will prepare pakodas and send it to the PM, and other Union ministers. “The Prime Minister should direct the Ministry of human Resource Development to introduce ‘pakoda making’ as a subject,” the protesters said.
 
 Around 50 students donning the Graduation Gown prepared pakodas to register protest with the Centre’s failure to create jobs.
