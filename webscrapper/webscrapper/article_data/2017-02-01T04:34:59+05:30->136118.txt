 Daksh, Ankit, Arjit — all are from Faridabad and BTech holders — and Gagan, a native of Bihar who used to work as an intermediate between the gang and customers, were produced in a city court on Tuesday which remanded them in police custody for three days.

 In January last year, Anand Ramaswami, a Bangalore resident, had lodged a complaint with SEBI against online share trading company MoneyCare Capital. In his complaint, Ramaswami alleged that the company, apparently located at JMD Megapolis Mall on Sohna Road, duped him of Rs 5 lakh.
 
 But, SEBI found that the company was not registered with the regulator, and approached the Gurgaon police. Preliminary probe by the police revealed that it was a fake company.
 
 “The youths had asked him to deposit Rs 5 lakh online to the company’s bank account for share trading. But after getting the money, they stopped responding to his calls,” Sumit Kuhar, DCP (crime), told TOI.
 
 Subsequently, an FIR was registered against unidentified people under Sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the IPC, and the case was handed over to the crime unit-1. After year-long investigations, the police’s cyber team found out the names and the mobile phone numbers of the four youths. They were called for questioning on Monday, when they confessed to their crime.
