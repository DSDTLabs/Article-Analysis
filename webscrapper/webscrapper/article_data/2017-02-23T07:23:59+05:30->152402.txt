PURULIA: Bandwan   Sudipto Biswas was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly extorting Rs 91,000 from a contractor of the state’s   project. Officers of the state’s   arrested Biswas on a complaint from contractor Satyenjoy Mondal. 

 Mondal, who was awarded a contract to build 35 toilets in Bandwan block, had executed the project and sought Rs 6.5 lakh from the BDO. Biswas told Mondal that he would hand him a cheque for the sum provided the contractor paid him Rs 91,000 in cash. Mondal tipped off the anti-corruption wing and a trap was laid for Biswas. 
 
 As Mondal left the BDO’s office on Tuesday after paying him, waiting anti-corruption sleuths raided the Biswas’s office and not only recovered the Rs 91,000 that Mondal had paid him, but a further Rs 2.5 lakh in cash. 
 
 The BDO, sources said, was unable to give a satisfactory explanation for holding so much cash. Arrested and brought to Kolkata, Biswas was produced in court on Wednesday.
