NEW DELHI:   on Saturday began a probe to find out if the pension payments in the alleged Rs 1,942.82 crore irregularities were made to bonafide former municipal employees or not. It also ruled out the possibility of a scam as the funds were released into the accounts of nationalised banks. 

  had lashed out against BJP after TOI, based on a municipal audit, had reported on January 25 that the amount was paid to pensioners without verification.
 
 Mayor  , after rounds of discussions, wrote a note to top officials, asking them to verify all details as early as possible. He, though, admitted to lapses on the part of the corporation and said the officials failed to verify details of payments.
 
 Though an uphill task, the corporation will verify the case of each pensioner against whom the money was released over a period of 18 years, an official said.
 
 “We will verify each penny paid. AAP is trying to project the irregularities as a scam to gain political mileage. Action will be taken against the officials found guilty,” Nayyar told TOI.
 
 Delhi minister   criticised the record verification move and said, “Why have the civic bodies not bothered to verify the records in the last 18 years? Both Congress and BJP ruled them in that period. Why was no probe ordered in 2015 when the chief auditor sent the corporation a notice about it?”
 
 AAP spokesperson   said, “How can we expect an impartial probe if the same officials who are under scanner for irregularities are verifying the authenticity of payments?” In 2016, the civic bodies had refused to go for an external audit proposed by the Delhi government, Bharadwaj added.
