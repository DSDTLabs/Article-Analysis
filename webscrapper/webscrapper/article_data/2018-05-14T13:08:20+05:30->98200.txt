KOCHI: District Childline officials are in the process of collecting funds for a short film aimed at improving awareness about child sexual abuse (CSA). "The worst part is that our sex education system is a failure. It has not been able to teach students to identify unsafe behaviour. Very often the child has no clue as to what is happening when they are being abused," said Abhilash T A, the district Childline coordinator. 

 He added that often even teachers also avoid teaching things related to sex education when it comes up during class. "As part of our awareness campaign, we are currently collecting funds to create a short film, which can be shown to students to raise awareness on the issue," he added.
 
 The district Childline coordinator said that he was informed of an incident similar to that of the one that happened at   last month. "It took place at an eatery in  , where a woman had come with her child and later they were joined by a man. He had publicly abused the child in the restaurant in a similar way that took place in Malappuram. Childline officials were informed about the incident by another customer who was at the eatery then.
 
 "When we arrived there, the hotel staff could not identify or remember the people that were involved in the incident. Unlike Malapurram, the hotel did not have a CCTV and hence the people involved in the case escaped," said Abhilash. He added that most child abuse cases involve a person closely related to the family.
