BHOPAL: Unable to cough up a sum of Rs 1 lakh to pay up penalty imposed by a community panchayat, a   ostracized by the panchayat has approached the   district collector on Tuesday seeking assistance.

 The community panchayat had imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on   for having failed to attend a meeting of the caste panchayat. Failure to pay up the penalty, family of Ahirwar were ostracized by the community panchayat of   village.
 
 The affected family approached collector and told that seven months ago, a panchayat was called upon to decide why the daughter of Mauji was living at her father’s house, even after her marriage? But Mauji, claims that he did not receive the information about panchayat and hence could not attend it. 
 
 On seeing Mauji absent from the panchayat meet, the community heads felt he was defying panchayat orders and passed a diktat that his family will be ostracized from the community till he pays a penalty of Rs 1 lakh. (Copy of that diktat is with the TOI) 
 
 After the aggrieved family members managed to meet the district collector the officials have assured to resolve the issue. 
 
 “The matter has come to our knowledge today and we have talked to the senior members of the community. The senior members of the community will be holding a meeting in the village and the issue will be resolved,” district collector   told TOI. 
 
 “I had held a meeting in the same village couple of days ago, but the victim did not approach us then. Had he informed us we would have been resolved on the same day,” he added.
