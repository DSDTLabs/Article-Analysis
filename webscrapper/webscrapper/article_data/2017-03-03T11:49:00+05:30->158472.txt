GORAKHPUR: Congress vice-president   on Thursday attacked Prime Minister   over   claiming that economists had termed the move as financial "madness". 

 Addressing a public meeting in Maharajganj, Rahul said, "The economists all over the world called note ban a financial madness and lunatic experiment, but Modiji calls it a fight against corruption. Only 50 families of the country were benefited by demonetisation. The people of India faced difficulties. Modiji evaded to discuss demonetization in Parliament, but is now trying to justify his move on the roads."
 
 "Modiji black money is lying in the houses of some rich people. Those who queued for their money were poor. The people of Hindustan don't have black money. People of Hindustan are honest people," Rahul added. Calling Modi a 'liar', Rahul said: "Wherever Modi goes he speaks lies. ISRO sent rockets and Modiji said that he sent them. During   election campaign, Modi promised people of giving employment to two crore youth, but I find a big force of unemployed youth in UP. He promised Bhojpuri film city, but did nothing for it so far." 
 
 "Now, he is making promises of waiving of loans of farmers with a condition of BJP government in the state. Manmohan Singhji waived off Rs 70,000 crore loans of farmers and at that time Congress party was not in power in the state. I want to ask him why he is imposing condition for waiving off farmers' loan," Rahul claimed.
