AGRA: Less than a month ago, pictures of a man carrying an   on his shoulder and a urine collection bag in his hands, attached to his ailing mother standing outside   on the social media had attracted  . But apparently little has changed.

 On Wednesday, pictures of a man with an oxygen cylinder on his shoulder with its tube attached to his critically ill newborn carried by his wife went viral.
 
 The couple was carrying the baby from one ward to another, 500 metres away in the scorching heat as no ward boy or stretcher was available.
 
 A resident of Jaitpur, labourer Suraj Singh admitted his newborn who was unable to breathe properly at SN Medical on Wednesday. After initial examination, child was given oxygen support and was referred to the microbiology department for diagnosis.
 
 When Suraj Singh, the father asked for help to carry the baby to the diagnosis centre,   staff expressed their inability to do so as no ward boy nor stretcher was available.
 
 Given the critical condition of his child, the man hoisted the heavy oxygen cylinder on his shoulder while his wife carried the baby to the diagnostic centre. After facing much trouble and requesting staffers, parents somehow managed to get diagnosis done and moved the baby back to the child ward.
 
 When the matter came to the notice of the higher authorities, college administration suspended ward boy   of the child ward and issued a warning to sister in-charge, Saroj, and staff nurse Sashi Gautam.
