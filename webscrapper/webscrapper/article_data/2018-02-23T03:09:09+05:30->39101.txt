NEW DELHI: In what is suspected to be  , two men were shot and stabbed several times in   on Thursday night. A third youth was also injured in the attack and admitted to Lok Nayak hospital in a critical condition. DCP (Rohini) Rajneesh Gupta confirmed the incident but refused to reveal any details.

 Sources said around 8.15pm, two youths, Govind (25) and Satish (40), were attacked by a group of bikers on the Balbir nursing home road on the Ghewra village carriageway. Though there were no eyewitnesses, initial probe suggests that they were shot five times each at a close range. The killers then stabbed their bodies with a knife. The third youth, Mukesh (30), was found a little distance away. The victims belong to the same family.
 
 The victims were taken to Raja Harishchandra hospital where Govind and Satish were declared  . Mukesh was later shifted to LNJP hospital. “One of the deceased had injuries on his face and abdomen, while the other had injuries in his abdomen and chest,” said a police officer.
 
 Cops are probing the role of Sandeep Dhillu, who had escaped from police custody in central Delhi last week. Dhillu has been trying to gain supremacy in the areas around Narela and parts of Sonipat. Police are also probing the role of hired killers from Haryana in the murders.
 
 Govind and Satish were property dealers and had cases of assault and attempt to murder registered against them in Delhi and Haryana. They were suspected to be involved with the Jitender Gogi gang, sources said.
 
 Family members said they were informed about the murders by someone claiming to be a well-wisher from one of the victims’ phones. They suspect one of the killers made the call. The bodies would be handed over to their family after autopsy on Friday.
 
 Locals said that a similar incident had taken place near Rampur underpass a month ago where a youth from Bankner village was killed.
