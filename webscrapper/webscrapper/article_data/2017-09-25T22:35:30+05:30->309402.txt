GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat BJP spokesperson   termed Congress vice president  's   started in   today as a flop show. He said Rahul's roadshow resulted into fiasco and failed to attract response from the people. 

 Pandya said, 'though Congress party did attempts to mobilise people from across the Saurashtra region, there were fewer people present in Rahul's road show.'
 
 Reacting further to Rahul's three-day Gujarat visit, Pandya said, 'Rahul Gandhi's visits happen to be dramatic and laughable. Congress has lost as many as 28 elections across the nation under leadership of Rahul Gandhi. Poll analysts and people rightly say that wherever Rahul steps in, Congress steps out and suffers defeat.' 
 
 'Whenever he visits Gujarat, he doesn't speak about good of Gujarat but do vicious politics. He doesn't reply the questions regarding injustice caused to Gujarat by Congress led governments in the Centre in past.'
 
 'Why Congress opposed  ? Delay in Narmada dam was a sin committed by Congress. Rahul should give reply and tender apology to farmers, women and people of Gujarat, Pandya said.
