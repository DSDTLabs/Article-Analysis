 and   seem to share a special bond. The duo shot a gruelling schedule of their film 'Raabta' in Mauritius, where they were required to perform high-octane stunts. Even though they had rehearsed the action scenes and attended rigorous workshops, doing it in an open space sounded like a risky proposition. Sushant, given his chivalry and the bond he shares with Kriti, kept an eye out for her while shooting the scenes. 

 Even when he was not in the frame or the sequence, he ensured that he was around on the set to help Kriti. While shooting, the actress suffered a muscle pull in her leg and Sushant helped her swiftly with an ice-pack to ease off the pain. His protectiveness about her continues even though they finished shooting a while ago. At a recent event for the filmâ€™s promotions, he made sure to either walk ahead of   or with her to ensure that she was protected.
