LUCKNOW: Apna Dal has been undergoing a situation similar to what the ruling SP is facing today. In October 2014, fissures within the party became public for the first time, as the party’s then national general secretary and Mirzapur MP   (currently Union minister) was removed from her post with immediate effect. 

 Apna Dal president   in a statement had said that the party as well as the Patel family had fallen prey to the high political ambitions of her daughter Anupriya and son-in-law Ashish Kumar Singh. Infighting between mother and daughter attained another height in May 2015, with the party expelling Anupriya from all party posts. Anupriya was also stripped of the party’s primary membership for anti-party activities. 
 
 However, Anupriya categorically stated that no party leader had the authority to expel her from the party. Both the factions then approached the   to claim that they are the real Apna Dal, party leaders said. The EC in its letter dated June 9, 2015 had urged both the factions of Apna Dal to amicably resolve their disputes either mutually or through any court of law. Till then, both the factions of the party would not be recognised by the commission, the letter mentioned. 
 
 Senior EC officials, when contacted, said that this effectively meant that the party cannot field its candidates under its election symbol, and the EC will treat the party candidates as independent candidates. “In other words, they may not get the benefits which other parties generally get from the EC,” an official of the poll panel said. 
 
 Meanwhile, in November 2016, an outfit named Apna Dal (Sonelal) got registered with the Election Commission of India. Anupriya’s father, Sonelal Patel, was the founder of the party. The dispute between Krishna Patel and her daughter and Union minister Anupriya Patel is still in court.
