PATIALA: The special National Investigation Agency ( ) court in Mohali on Thursday deferred the final decision on shifting of the accused of the targeted killings in Punjab to Delhi’s Tihar jail by another day. The accused are presently lodged at various jails across Punjab.

 The NIA had on February 12 moved an application before the court seeking shifting of the accused in the case to Tihar jail citing security reasons, following which the court had fixed the hearing for Thursday.
 
 In its plea, the NIA had claimed that there was “desperate threat” to the life of the targeted killings accused and they should be transferred outside Punjab. The NIA had stated, “So faced with the sole purpose of protecting the fundamental rights of the accused as enshrined in article 21 of the Constitution of India we have taken a conscious decision for the safety and security of the accused persons.” The probe agency had claimed that inputs had been received from intelligence agencies in this regard.
 
 Appearing on behalf of the UK national Jagtar Singh Johal alias Jaggi, defence counsels Brijinder Singh Sodhi and Jaspal Singh Manhjpur, said they had contested the NIA’s stance on the grounds that the plea was not maintainable in the special court and only the   of India could take a decision to shift the jail accused outside the state where the crime had been committed.
 
 Besides, “The accused have a right to stay in places near to their home so that their family members can meet them,” said Sodhi. Manjhpur said the power to shift the accused outside the state rested with the Supreme Court as enshrined in article 142 of the Indian Constitution.
 
 The NIA is investigating eight incidents related to the targeted killings in Punjab in which it has so far arrested 11 accused, including UK national Jagtar Singh Johal alias Jaggi, Taljit Singh alias Jimmy, sharpshooter   alias Shera, his associate Ramandeep Singh alias Bagga and weapon supplier  , besides others.
