BENGALURU: Once again,   hit the streets to voice their concern. Saturday morning saw over a thousand citizens  . Their message was loud and clear: don't cut the city's trees.

 Not just residents in the neighbourhood, citizens from   and   too joined the protest against BBMP's move to axe 112 trees along Jayamahal Road. The demonstration was organized by Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB) along with citizens from Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Banaswadi, JP Nagar, Vidyranyapura, Jayanagar and groups like Neralu, Bygone Era of Bengaluru, BPAC Civic Hub, I Change Indira Nagar, CiFOS, Whitefield Rising and  .
 
 This is the second time that citizens in large numbers raised their voice against tree cutting for infrastructure projects. On October 16, 2016, over 3,000 people formed a human chain on Ballari Road against the proposed steel flyover.
 
 The protesters said if they allowed BBMP to cut trees on Jayamahal Road, it will pave the way for BDA to push the flyover project. BBMP had proposed to widen Jayamahal Road till Mehkri Circle and sought nod to chop 112 trees of various species along the boundary of Palace Grounds.
 
 Srinivas Alavilli, coordinator of CfB, said: “The Brand Bengaluru is under serious threat and so are our trees. No amount of road widening is going to fix traffic congestion. It is ridiculous to cut 112 fully grown trees on Jayamahal Road. The BBMP has sought for objections from the public. Now they got their reply through this mass demonstration. We demand it to acknowledge the mass objection and shelve the road widening project. The government must focus on multi-modal public transport as an alternative.“
