LUCKNOW: Clean drinking water at an affordable price of Rs 2 per   will soon be available in Lucknow with urban development minister   launching mobile   from April 8 onwards. The concept has been devised by a GOI-recognised start-up,  , which is being supported and funded by IIT-Kanpur. The project is being supported by LMC and a total of 20 ATMs will be flagged from LMC headoffice in Lalbagh. 

 A water ATM is a water vending cart which dispenses a recycleable, food grade quality paper glass with 250 ml of clean, chilled drinking water when Rs 2 coin is deposited in the machine. Besides giving standard quality water, the system also helps in keeping the environment clean by discouraging use of plastic bottles and pouches. 
 
 Vineet Vats, the founder of the start-up, said, “After a year-long struggle to get NOCs from various departments, we would be able to provide clean drinking water to those on the go. These will be operational from Saturday in places with high footfall, like Charbagh railway station, Kaiserbagh bus station, Polytechnic crossing, Nakhas and Chowk markets.”
 
 The company has tied up with ONGC to fund water ATMs for differently-abled people so that they can earn their livelihood. Vats said, “We will be offering 20 ATMs on Saturday of which seven have been bought by ONGC and given to differently-abled people to earn their livelihood as a part of corporate social responsibility. The rest have been bought and would be run by private entrepreneurs.”
 
 The company will launch more ATMs in Lucknow and Kanpur. These water ATMs are provided with several quality sensors which check water quality on parameters like pH value, temperature and purity before dispensing it to the consumer. People can also get to see the quality of water on LED displayed on cart. Vats said, “If at all the water gets contaminated or is not up to the standard, the sensors will automatically stop dispensing water to public.”
