On late Sunday evening, armed with light rods, lezims, green silk scarves and high-voltage energy, around 60 youngsters broke into a jig on the terrace of a mall in Ghatkopar. And they did that for a reason — to ensure the tribal kids from   get enough funds for their education. With over 150 people cheering the crowd, the youngsters participated in a 25-minute long flash mob and danced like there’s no tomorrow. They performed to songs like 'Ishq Tera Tadpave', 'Ek Pal Ka Jeena', ' ', ' ', ' ' and ' ', among others and were later joined by the tribal children, who added more fun to the event.
It was heartening to see the kids shaking a leg and communicating in English with each other. In the middle of their samosa break, we spoke to Rupesh, a student of Class 8 from a Marathi medium school in Kandivali. “I want to be a choreographer, just like my dance teacher. English and drawing are my favourite subjects and I can be a great artist, too. I bet I can draw anything,” he said, confidence reflecting in his voice.  , who choreographed the act, said, “The idea was to get everyone together, leave behind their worries and just dance their hearts out. It’s such a rarity in a city like Mumbai where everyone is always running around.” The youngsters, who participated in the flash mob with full gusto, also volunteer to teach these kids English, Maths, dance among other subjects.  , who heads the group, told us, “It gives us immense pleasure to hear the little ones communicate in English and see them match steps with us. This has been one of our most fun events in a while.”
