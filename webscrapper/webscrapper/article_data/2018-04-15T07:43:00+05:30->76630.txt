CHANDIGARH: Haryana health minister Anil Vij has served a   on Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala over the latter’s allegations of a scam in the purchase of medicines by the health department.

Vij had used the term while referring to the allegations of a scam in the health department.

 Vij said that Dushtyant was unnecessarily bent on defaming the government. “He had levelled the allegation of a Rs 300-crore scam while the department had made local purchase of Rs 40.86 crore. Either Dushyant should prove the allegations or we will file a criminal case against him,” he warned.
 
 Earlier this month, Dushyant had alleged a scam in the local purchase of medicines and disposables by various hospitals across Haryana. It was alleged that the some of the material was procured from non-existent companies or firms, which did not posses a pharmaceutical licence from the state.
