AHMEDABAD: Special Operation Group (SOG) of the city crime branch on Sunday arrested four persons from Mumbai for cheating two   of gold dust particles or buff powder worth over Rs 26 lakh. SOG officials said earlier they had arrested one Gulam Shaikh of Ahmedabad and handed him over to Anandnagar police as one of the jeweller cheated by the gang had lodged a complaint at Anandnagar police station.

 However, the other four accused in the case remained at large until SOG officials tracked their location to a Rajkot hotel.
 
 ACP, SOG, B C Solanki said a team was dispatched immediately to Rajkot. “We got hold of ID proofs of two of the four who had stayed at the hotel before coming to the city for the purpose of cheating. The ID proofs had Mumbai addresses,” Solanki said.
 
 Sources from the SOG said getting hold of addresses provided a breakthrough. “We went to Mumbai and traced all four accused one by one.
 
 “Ravindra Kunchikorve was traced from Dharavi, Jasim Shaikh and Narendra Kutkure from Shivri, and Salman Shaikh from Ghatkopar East in Mumbai. They were brought to the city on Sunday,” said a senior SOG official.
 
 ACP Solanki said that during primary interrogation it came to light that the four accused from Mumbai had come to the city to get gold dust, also known as buff powder, in the local language.
 
 “They got the cell number of Gulam Shaikh from a person in   area. They called him and decided to cheat bigger jewellers. The gang conned a gold jewellery manufacturer in Madhavpura and later a jewellery showroom in Aanandnagar in February 2018. They have been handed over to the local police for further investigation,” said an SOG official.
