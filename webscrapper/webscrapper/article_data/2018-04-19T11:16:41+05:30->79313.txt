PATNA: The   (GRP) arrested Shashank Shekhar Deo (28) and his nephew Suraj Kumar Yash Deo (19) for allegedly thrashing   (ACJM) Prashant Kumar Jha (44) on Gaya-Patna passenger train on April 16 night. Jha is ACJM at Pupri in  .

 “They were arrested from village Braharshi Nagar under the Makhdumpur police station area in Jehanabad district on the basis of a video clip of the incident recorded by a co-passenger,” Jehanabad GRP SHO Shakuntala Kisku said. She said Jha had gone to Gaya for some personal work and was returning to Patna when the incident took place on sharing a seat in the train.
 
 “Shashank removed Jha by pulling the collar of his shirt,” the SHO said and added though both sat separately after that, Shashank called his friends over the phone. At least five of his friends boarded the train at Banawar halt before Makhdumpur and thrashed Jha.
 
 The SHO said nine more youths boarded the train at Makhdumpur and joined their friends, who thrashed Jha again. “They all alighted from the train at the station and fled,” she said.
 
 “When the train stopped at Jehanabad, Jha approached the GRP with profusely bleeding nose and grievous injuries in his head. He was immediately taken to the hospital. An FIR was lodged on Jha’s complaint. Raids are on to arrest the other suspects involved in the incident,” the SHO said.
 
 Meanwhile,   (BJSA) secretary Ajit Kumar Singh on Wednesday condemned the incident. “BJSA had earlier given representation to the home secretary and the DGP for providing bodyguards to all judges in the state irrespective of rank, but no decision has been taken in this regard so far. It shows the government’s apathy,” he said.
