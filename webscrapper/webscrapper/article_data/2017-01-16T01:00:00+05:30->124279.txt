 Kendre said, "I’ve known him for the last 30-35 years. When I came to NSD, he and Naseeruddin Shah were already established actors in parallel cinema. They were like icons for us. Bollywood mein ek image ki demand hoti hai and he was the first one to break that image because of his talent, commitment and passion. I had spoken to him last week before his death, bahut kaam karne thay unhe, bahut saare sapne poore karne thay. He wanted to come back to do theatre, hum saath mein play bhi karna chahte thay. He was only 66, unki umar nahin thi jaane ki. It’s definitely a loss for the NSD family, but I think it’s a bigger loss for the performing arts community."

 AK Barua from NSD, added, "His batchmate Bhanu also spoke at the meeting. He told everyone that when Om Puri came to Delhi from Patiala, he had a Punjabi accent and he used to face a lot of problems because of that. But he worked really hard on it and by the third year, not only his Punjabi accent was gone, but he also became one of the best actors from his batch. That was his motivation and commitment towards his work."
