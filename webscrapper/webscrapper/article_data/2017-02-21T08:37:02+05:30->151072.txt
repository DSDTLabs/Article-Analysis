 On a tip-off, Ludhiana-based investigation wing of the department recently picked up a Scooty of an Amritsar-based diamond wholesaler.

He used to sell diamonds to them.
 
 During an initial probe conducted by I-T assistant director Rahul Pada, it was found that the businessman had shown sale of only Rs 40 lakh last year, while he had sold diamonds worth Rs 12 crore to the shopkeepers based in other cities. Sources said the trader personally delivered diamonds to his clients, writing transactions on paper chits, and took money in cash. For making deliveries in Amritsar and nearby towns, he used to travel by his two-wheeler, which raised suspicion of the I-T department. The department started keeping a watch on his movements and finally took action last week with the help of police.
 
 Sources said after the department countered the accused with proofs of tax evasion, he agreed to cooperate and share details of sales made and names of his suppliers and clients. Some of his clients include prominent jewellers. An I-T official said, "The exact amount of tax evasion will be ascertained once investigations are over. Businessmen who have figured in the diary are guilty of unaccounted sale and purchase and have black money."
