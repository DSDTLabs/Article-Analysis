BHOPAL: State minister for food and civil supplies Om Prakash Dhurve was on Friday detained by police for alleged violation of the model code of conduct in poll-bound Umeria district. 

 Dhurve was detained from a hotel in Umeria town around 9pm and taken to Kotwali police station following a complaint by Congress workers, say sources. Congress leader Rajesh Sharma had approached the district election officer alleging that several BJP leaders, including Dhurve, were canvassing in the area even after campaigning had ended according to EC rules. 
 
 A team of 20 policemen, led by SDM Rishi Pawar, rounded up Dhurve from his room (Number 151) and took him to Kotwali police station. Umeria SP Sathyendra Kumar Shukla said the minister was detained and released out of the borders of Umeria district. 
 
 Dhurve told reporters outside the police station that he had concluded his campaign within the stipulated time period and had gone to his room to collect his baggage when police came. District collector Abhishek Singh said the returning officer has been asked to examine whether a case needs to be registered against him. 
 
 The model code bans campaigns and public meetings during the 48-hour period ahead of voting. Byelections for Ater (Bhind) and Umeriaâ€™s Bandhavgarh (ST) assembly constituencies will be held on April 9 and counting of votes is on April 13.
