CHENNAI: When chain snatchers struck two women in separate incidents on Saturday, they didn’t steal gold alone but also made off with their victims’ courage to step out in public.

 While A Jayashree, 57, of Kunrathur is spending sleepless nights, V Menaka, 52, of Old Washermenpet is unable to control herself from breaking down.
 
 
 
  
 
 Two days after her   by two men on bike, Jayashree hasn’t stepped out of her house.
 
 “I will not. I am scared,” said Jayashree, who rarely came out of her home. After having lost her   on Saturday, she has decided not to step out at all anymore. She had come from Bengaluru just two months ago and is yet to recover from the shock a full day after the incident. It is not just soft-spoken Jayashree, the entire locality of   in Kunrathur is terrified, as this has happened just two weeks after they installed   and in full public view at 5.15pm.
 
 Jayashree told her relatives that even looking at a crowd leaves her restless. The residents have installed at least nine CCTV cameras in the locality pooling money among themselves. However, they now feel CCTV cameras — considered an effective tool to solve a crime — don’t seem to deter criminals considering the incidents at Arumbakkam and Kunrathur.
 
 With bruises all over her body, Jayashree was unable to carry on her routine work. She is being assisted by her relatives. “We are scared to even narrate the incident. Police have assured us all help,” said Narendran, one of the relatives.
 
 Menaka, a resident of Old Washermenpet, broke down whenever relatives came home to console her. “This is like rebirth to me. I am lucky to survive but I have lost all my confidence. I am scared to lead a peaceful life,” says Menaka.
 
 “With grievous injuries on my neck, I am unable to even swallow food. Not just that road, even the sound of a bike scares me,” says Menaka while being consoled by her daughter Janaki.
