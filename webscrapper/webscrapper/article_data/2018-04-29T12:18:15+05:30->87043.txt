The second 'Weekend cha Dav' episode of Bigg Boss Marathi started with the host,  's grand entry.
 
 Mahesh took the stage to spice up the house in this special episode. He showed a quick recap of the previous episode.
 
 After the recap, 11th day in the house was shown. The day started with the song 'Baby bring it on Alinganala'.
 
 There was a cycle kept in the garden area. Smita and Pushkar took a ride on that.
 
  and Sai were gossiping about   whereas   and   were seen talking about Megha. 
 
 Mahesh then took charge of all the contestants. He didn't leave a single chance in roasting   for his unethical and unfair behaviour.
 
 Mahesh also referred to him as a backstabber.   made him realise that rather than supporting his own team he was helping the opposite side.
 
 Pushkar also said that Aastad did a blunder by putting water while playing a task, which was not allowed.
 
 Mahesh then turned towards Jui for her master plan. She did the act of fainting which might have affected Usha's health as she got hyper in that situation.
 Then Mahesh asked Rajesh, how can he say anything related to 'slum mentality'? On which Rajesh said that his reaction was out of aggression.
 
 Sai told Mahesh that Resham has said a lot to her which has hurt her deeply, on which Resham said that some players have already decided how to play the game and came here. Resham even felt that putting trash or shampoo during the task was out of aggression which she didn't like. Megha justified this by saying, it was just to complete the task and not out of aggression.
 
 Sushant said Mahesh that he feels,   is also a 'double dholki' along with Aastad.
 
 After taking out all the grievances and arguments, the episode came to an end. 
 
 The upcoming episode of 'Weekend cha Daav' will decide who goes out from the show and who all stay back.
