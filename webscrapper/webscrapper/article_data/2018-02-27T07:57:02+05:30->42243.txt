CHENNAI: Can the portrait of a judge who is impeached or convicted be unveiled in the corridors of court? Or what happens if the portraits of rowdies are allowed to be displayed and glorified in police stations? Similarly, allowing former chief minister  's portrait to remain in   would create such adverse impact on peoples mind, the   said before the Madras high court on Monday. 

 Drawing a hypothetical situation, senior counsel for DMK P Wilson said, "If a resolution is passed in TN assembly to hang the portrait of V   or people who have been convicted, can the constitutional courts fold their hands and keep quiet?"
 
 Speaker of the assembly is governed by the Constitution and certainly all his actions, including administrative decisions, should be tested within the constitutional parameters, he added.
 
 To this, the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice Abdul Quddhose observed that if people were against displaying Jayalalithaa's portrait in the assembly it would reflect in elections and the speaker of the next assembly would take a decision on the issue.
 
 Pointing out that in the MLAs disqualification case, the court admitted a petition and is hearing it because personal rights of those legislators enshrined under the Constitution were alleged to have been affected, the bench said, "in any other case we don't think the court can interfere in speaker's action."
 
 The bench posted the plea to March 2.
