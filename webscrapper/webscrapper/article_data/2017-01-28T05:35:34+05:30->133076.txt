LUCKNOW: BJP workers in   district, where the saffron outfit has fielded ‘rani’   in a bid to upset the apple cart of its rivals, are up in arms against the party for its ‘bad selection of candidates’.

 BJP has dropped two party loyalists from its list of nominees, triggering mass protests in the ranks across the district. On Friday, scores of party workers burnt the effigies of Union minister  , holding her responsible for the changes in candidature. 
 
 The loudest protests are concentrated in Gauriganj assembly constituency, where the BJP dropped veteran leader and four-term MLA Tejbhan Singh, 72 , in favour of Uma Shankar Pandey, a local RSS worker and advocate. He also served as Irani’s election agent in Amethi when she contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. 
 
 Nearly 250 office-bearers of the local BJP unit in Amethi have refused to help Pandey and 392 booth presidents in Gauriganj have tendered their resignations. P 6
