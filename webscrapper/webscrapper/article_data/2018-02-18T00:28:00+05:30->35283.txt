Tirunelveli is bracing for acute drinking water shortage if the depleting water levels of the reservoirs in the district are any indication. The quantity of water available in the 11 reservoirs in Tirunelveli district stood at 5393.387 mcft on Friday. This is a mere 39.16% of their combined capacity of 13771.01 mcft. 

 Since, water for Pisanam cultivation has to be released till March 31, as announced by the Chief Minister, to benefit the farmers who cultivate paddy on 86,000 hectares in Tirunelveli and Tuticorin districts, it is understood that the water level will go down further.
 
 Tough Cyclone Ockhi brought disaster to the southern districts a couple of months back claiming the lives of more than 200 fishermen, it also filled the reservoirs in Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts that remained dry after overflowing in 2015.
 
 This ensured a promising Pisanam paddy season water release in Thamirabarani River from Papanasam and Manimuthar reservoirs, the two major reservoirs in the region with a combined capacity of 11,011 mcft. 
 
 Water level in Papanasam climbed 22 feet and Manimuthar by 15 feet in a day as they recorded 451 mm and 378 mm rainfall till 8 am on December 1.
 
 For close to three days, around 25,000 to 30,000 cusecs of water was released from these reservoirs into Thamirabarani River to avoid overflowing. The Northeast monsoon that followed also helped water levels in Papanasam and Manimuthar reservoirs to climb to 139 feet and 114 feet, against their full storage capacity of 143 feet and 118 feet, respectively.
 
 The nine other smaller reservoirs in Tirunelveli district and hundreds of small rain-fed and system-fed tanks also overflowed, while the rain also helped improving the underground water table. But this is not enough to meet the drinking water requirements of lakhs of people in this region this summer.
 
 On Friday 1,384 cusecs was released from the 11 reservoirs in the district for irrigation. More water will be released for Pisanam cultivation in the coming days. This is likely to worsen the drinking water crisis in the two districts, for which Thamirabarani is the only source of drinking water.
