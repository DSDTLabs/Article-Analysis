When you think about cybercrimes, you generally picture credit card fraud or bank account/email hacking. But the soon-to-be-released   film,  , shows us that there is more to   and exposes just how vulnerable we are all to it.
 Telling us more about the suspense that is based on cybercrimes, director   says, “We are all constantly giving out data. With a simple search online, you’re being extensively watched and profiled — that’s how the ads target us. In this digital era, everything we do is connected to the internet, which means that our privacy is at stake. At what time you wake up, what time you log on to the internet, your location (from your mobile phone) — everything is being watched. The entire data is being profiled and sold. Nothing is personal anymore. Strangers know how often you eat outside, what food you like, how many hours you’re on call and what you like to buy. How comfortable are you being that exposed?” This, the director adds, is what the film explores.
  Janardhan did extensive research for the film, by combing through reports of recent incidents of cybercrimes. And although the film draws inspirations from several real-life crimes, it is not based on any real incident.
