MUMBAI: Eighteen-year-old  , belonging to a comparatively unknown town of Pallapatti in  , is all set to break a global space record by launching the   in the world, weighing a mere 64 grams.

 The satellite, called KalamSat, will be launched by a   sounding rocket on June 21 from  , a NASA facility. This will be the first time an Indian student's experiment will be flown by NASA.
 
 Speaking to TOI from Pallapatti, Rifath said it will be a sub-orbital flight and post-launch, the mission span will be 240 minutes and the tiny satellite will operate for 12 minutes in a micro-gravity environment of space. "The main role of the satellite will be to demonstrate the performance of 3-D printed carbon fibre," he explained. He said the satellite was selected through a competition called 'Cubes in Space', jointly organised by NASA and a organisation called 'I Doodle Learning'. 
 
 The main challenge was to design an experiment to be flown to space which will fit into a four-metre cube weighing exactly 64 grams. "We did a lot of research on different cube satellites all over the world and found ours was the lightest," he said. Rifath said the satellite is made mainly of reinforced carbon fibre polymer. "We obtained some of the components from abroad and some are indigenous," he said.
