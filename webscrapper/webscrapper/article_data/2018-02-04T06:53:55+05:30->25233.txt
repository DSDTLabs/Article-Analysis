KOLKATA: The   and the mayhem that followed left thousands stuck in a traffic jam on the arterial road for one-and-a-half hours. Many took to social media to vent their anger while others sought help from friends on Facebook and Twitter, asking for alternative routes.

 The Kolkata Traffic Police’s Facebook page was flooded with messages from commuters who sought to know what had happened. “And we’re simply sitting in cars staring at taxis, autos, buses and trucks that read ‘SAFE DRIVE, SAVE LIFE’,” wrote  , adding: “One o’clock on a Saturday afternoon, I sat in my office, stunned after a phone call from my mom. ‘Please don’t step out with the car for a few hours, a major accident just took place on the Bypass, two children were just run down by the killer buses. Spot dead. Yes, that’s what we call them in our city. Because that’s what they do’. I don’t know how setting a bus on fire will help anyone,” she wrote. “The bus drivers will not be affected because, to start with, the buses don’t even belong to them.”
