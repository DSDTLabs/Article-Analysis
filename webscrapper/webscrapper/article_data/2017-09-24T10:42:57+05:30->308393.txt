CHANDIGARH: Leader of opposition in the   assembly Sukhpal Singh   on Saturday castigated the   government for its favouritism by returning Rs 84 lakh penal rent earlier recovered from former chief minister and Congress leader   for overstaying in official bungalow.

 It was on Wednesday that the Punjab council of ministers had decided to return the penal rent amount for overstay in government bunglow No. 45 in Sector 2, Chandigarh. It was paid by Bhattal in February to get no-due certificate from the government for contesting the state assembly elections.
 
 Terming it as a feudalistic act, Khaira said the state government could have saved many precious lives of farmers from the clutches of suicide by waiving their loans using this amount. He urged that the Congress government must review its erroneous order to pay back a whopping Rs 84 lakh penalty to Bhattal. At the same time, he also urged Bhattal not to accept this largesse showered upon her at a time when farmers were committing suicide for just Rs 1 lakh. He said that it would enhance Bhattal's political status.
 
 Khaira said on one handManpreet   is advocating shunning of a meal to help farmers tide over debt crisis, the state   on the other hand is showering largesse upon a wealthy leader like Bhattal.
