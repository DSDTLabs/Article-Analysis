HYDERABAD: A day after Delhibased Afghan refugee Masood Mohammed Yaqub’s estranged wife Niloufer and their three children were traced by Cyberabad police,   police said the woman obtained   for her children and herself, showing one Sameeruddin as her husband.

 
 On Saturday, Rajendranagar police arrested Niloufer, her second husband Jalaluddin Akbar on the charge of cheating and forgery, while her three children were sent to State Home on the directions of the local court. A six-month-old baby, who was born to Niloufer from her relationship with Akbar, was, however, allowed to be with his mother. The arrested were sent to judicial remand too.
 
  
  
 
 It is learnt that Niloufer had obtained the Aadhaar cards and her voter ID by paying thousands of rupees to one Sameeruddin.
 
 “When questioned about Sameeruddin and his whereabouts, Niloufer could not provide any details. Though she had married Masood first and later Akbar, Sameeruddin was mentioned as her husband in the illegally obtained ID proofs and as father in the case of the children,” Rajendranagar additional inspector D Venkatesh said.
 
 
 Cyberabad police said Masood, a cook in a hotel in Delhi, came to India along with Niloufer and their three children in 2013 and obtained refugee ID cards. In September 2015, Niloufer went missing along with the children by leaving a letter at their residence, mentioning about her decision to move to  , where her parents reside. After two years of search, Niloufer was traced in Rajendranagar, married to city-based Akbar, a mechanic, without giving divorce to Masood.
