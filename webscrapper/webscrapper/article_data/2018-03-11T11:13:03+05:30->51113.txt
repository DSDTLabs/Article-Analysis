LUCKNOW: Exuding confidence that the   would sweep the ongoing Lok   bypolls in the state, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya today said the 2014 Lok Sabha record would be repeated by the saffron party.

 "I am confident that on March 14, the record which was made in   in 2014 (Lok Sabha general elections) will be repeated, and our candidate   will emerge victorious," he told reporters after casting his vote for Phulpur parliamentary constituency along with his family members.
 
  
  
 
 Voting for the bye-elections to   and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats commenced today amid tight security.
 
 The bypolls were necessitated after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the deputy chief minister vacated the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats respectively, following their election to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council.
 
 On being asked about the BJP's expansion plans in the state in view of the electoral understanding between SP and BSP, Maurya said, "We have already expanded enough, and in future if any political party wants to join us, it will be definitely deliberated upon.
 
 "But, today from the UP's point of view, poll alliance of the BJP, Apna Dal (Sonelal) and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) exists. Apart from this, we do not have any other alliance. And, banking on this alliance, we will win 80 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state," he said.
 
 Taking a jibe at the SP-BSP tie-up, the minister said, "Their (SP-BSP) votes will be transferred only when they have enough votes. The votes (of the people) are with us. But, they have only leaders who make statements...The voters of Mayawatiji have deserted the BSP and have reposed their faith in Modiji, Yogi and BJP. We are winning both the Lok Sabha seats, and with wider margin".
