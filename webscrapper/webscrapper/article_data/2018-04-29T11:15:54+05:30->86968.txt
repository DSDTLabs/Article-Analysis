  Cosby on Thursday (local time) has been found guilty by a Pennsylvania jury, in connection with aggravated indecent assault against a woman in 2004 in a high-stakes retrial.
 
  According to a report, cosby, 80, was convicted on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and sexually assaulting former   basketball administrator Andrea Constand in a Philadelphia suburb in 2004. The former comedian faces a sentence of 10 years on each count.
 
  The panel of seven men and five women had been deliberating about 14 hours over two days before reaching a verdict.
 
  Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, has said the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Prosecutors used Cosby's past admissions about drugs and sex, as well as the testimony of five other women, to back up accuser Andrea Constand's allegations.
 
  It's the only criminal case to arise from allegations from more than 60 women, according to the reports. The disgraced comedian first went to trial last year, and the case ended in a mistrial after the jury failed to deliver a verdict.
