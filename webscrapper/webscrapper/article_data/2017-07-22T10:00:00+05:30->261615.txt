Bloomsbury's latest book,   Diary, is about a woman who was sexually abused by her father. It’s stirred up some controversy as the anonymous author admits how at times she enjoyed it.

 The author writes, "My father is my secret. That he raped me is my secret. But the secret under the secret is that sometimes I liked it. Sometimes I wanted it, and sometimes I seduced him..."
  
 The book not only describes in graphic detail the physical   she bore but follows the psycho-emotional impact all these events had on her. She explains how her family relations were skewed because of this."When I was eight years old, we moved to a new house. I assumed the master bedroom was for me and my father and that my mother would sleep in one of the other bedrooms.”
  
 "I had a count in my head of how many times my parents had sex. This was very important to me. I hated them for having sex with each other," she wrote.
 
 The author recalls he began abusing her from when she was just 3 years old and this carried on to her twenties. She’s past forty now and she says when she confronted her father as an adult he denied her version of events.
 The author wishes to remain anonymous, which has raised questions on the truth of the tale but   put in a pre-emptive note in the text to assure their faith in the facts.
  
 "I have no doubt about her honesty or clarity of mind,"  , the book’s American editor, writes, "We are publishing it because we believe it is a work of art."
 
 Stein said they went to great lengths to verify the story, insisting they “interviewed old friends to whom the author confided the fact of her abuse years ago,” and they have seen medical records.
 
 The book has been considered controversial because it’s very graphic and it might appeal to or encourage those with similar sexual preferences; but it could also be seen as showing those who have suffered that there is a way to grow up beyond abuse.
