DUBAI: On Sunday afternoon   in a grey RF tee, trendy sweatpants and matching shoes cut the perfect pose for normcore dressing. Easy , relaxed, yet sharp. Making his first appearance at a tournament site since his stirring run in Melbourne __ where he added to his record   collection __ tennis' most-decorated man, affable and articulate, play and persona, is as much superstar athlete as the sport's fashion statement.

 Federer 35, father of four, who went almost five seasons without winning a major, not that they were poor years, coming up short in the final hurdle a couple of times, besides closing in on the topranking, said, he was `still rid ing the wave' of his Melbourne Park triumph.
 
 “It's taken time to understand everything that happened. It was nice not having a tournament to play right away ,“ Federer, seeded third in the  , where he opens against Frenchman  , said. “So my last shot is still the forehand cross court, it is still match point, it's still the Rafa ( ) match... That's what I still have in mind. I'm still riding the wave. Those were incredible moments, some of the strongest I've ever felt as a tennis player.“ It was more so because of the mountain he had to climb last year. “It was a tough year (2016) on many levels, playing basically one healthy tournament in Australia. I was sick in Brisbane or injured or not well or hurt throughout the rest of the season. So for me to then to come back this way , couldn't have been any better.“
 
 Federer said he hadn't watched a replay of the final.“I've had friends and everybody say , `Let's watch and make a movie night', and I'm like, `No, not three-and-a-half-hours please',“ Federer said.
