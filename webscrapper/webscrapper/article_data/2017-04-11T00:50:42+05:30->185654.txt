MUMBAI: In yet another setback to builder   of  , the  , in an interim order, restrained him from creating any third-party rights over a Rs 4 crore flat in Juhu till April 13. The builder, who is in jail, was found by Justice S J Kathawalla to have defrauded many flat buyers in another case last year, observed the HC.

 Uttam Jain (58), a  , said in 2011, he executed a sale agreement with the builder for the entire seventh floor in Kamla Madhur building in Juhu, where earlier Chandrakala bungalow stood. His lawyer Tushar Gujjar said he paid Rs 3.26 crore for the Rs 1,500-sq ft flat, which costs Rs 3.83 crore. But work on the 10-storey building has not progressed beyond six floors, said Uttam, who is demanding that his flat agreement be registered.
 
 The builder, represented by advocate Bipin Joshi, said the agreement that the buyer is relying on “is forged”, but Justice G S Patel was not convinced and said his signatures match across pages and documents.
 
 The builder claimed Uttam had “suppressed” his intervention in another dispute. The HC observed that the builder had proposed to dispose of the seventh floor flat to settle that dispute, but agreed to give away another flat after the intervention. “At best, it shows that the buyer was perhaps less than circumspect in his dealings with the builder and was defrauded multiple times,” said Justice Patel. “There is a case made out that the builder has disposed the flat or is about to do so to third parties.” The HC asked the builder to file a reply by April 13. —Swati Deshpande
