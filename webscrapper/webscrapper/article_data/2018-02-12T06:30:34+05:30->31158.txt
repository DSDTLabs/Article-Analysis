BANGARMAU: Stigma continues to haunt the people in   town of   which is under the spotlight after detection of about 58 people carrying HIV.

 In Prem Ganj, one of the three villages where 38 had been found HIV positive, majority of houses don’t have toilet. Those with the infection are now being stopped from defecating in the fields by influential local people.  , 54, who has been found HIV positive and lives on the outer part of Prem Ganj along with his four children, only wishes to have a toilet in his house which would not only prevent him from relieving in the open, but avoid wrath of ‘powerful’ locals.
 
 “We can’t use farmlands because they fear that they too will contract the virus,” said Gangadeen. “Rich and mighty have built toilets in their homes but the poor people like us cannot afford it,” said  , 45, another HIV positive from Prem Ganj.
 
 “There are no toilets in our houses and we have to use either the area near the farms to relieve ourselves or railway tracks. Powerful and mighty people stop us from defecating in their fields, while   book us for tresspassing. It seems toilets are meant only for ‘rich’ and not for poor people like us,” says Parmanand, 60, another HIV positive.
 
 When contacted, an influential farmer said they cannot allow HIV positive people to use their farmlands for defecation. “They have already ruined their lives. If we will allow them, they will spread HIV virus and ruin us and our future generations,” he said.
