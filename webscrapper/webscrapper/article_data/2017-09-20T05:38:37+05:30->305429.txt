GURUGRAM: In another case of infighting between   of  , a group approached the Punjab and   high   on Monday with a writ petition, challenging the order of the Haryana registrar general of societies for an audit of the accounts of the condominium in DLF 5.

 The group of 21 residents approached the district registrar with a complaint about financial irregularities conducted by the earlier petitioners, who were in charge of the RWA funds in 2014. The RWA had earlier filed for an audit with the district registrar of societies in Gurgaon, which was later upheld by the state registrar of societies and the registrar general). The new complainants claimed the basis for the audit ordered earlier is wrong, and favours the RWA.
 
 “The complaint against the RWA for a re-audit doesn’t stand, as it was neither signed by one third members of the general body, as required under Section 54(1) of the Haryana Registration and Regulation of the Societies Act 2012, nor was it supported by any evidence against the governing body, as required under Section 54(2) of the same act,” said Ajay Jain, secretary, Wellington estate condominium association.
 
 One of the respondents in the petition, Bhaskar Chaterjee, said, “We approached the district registrar after we realised that there were major financial irregularities on the part of the RWA. However, despite our repeated complaints and orders from the registrar’s office, these members did not get the audit done.”
 
 State registrar of societies Wazir Singh, when approached on the matter, said, “All orders from our office are passed in quasi-judicial capacity, and we are not liable to offer any explanations on the order.
