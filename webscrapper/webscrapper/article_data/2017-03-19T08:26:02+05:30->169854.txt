PALANPUR: A man and seven family members were awarded   for burning his wife alive in   of Mehsana in October 2015.

 Mehsana district and sessions judge D A Joshi on Friday also imposed Rs 15,000 fine on each convict. Those convicted include deceased Surya Dantani's husband Viram, father-in-law Hira, mother-in-law Krushna, Jasu, Dinabhai, Chandaben and Raiben. All were sent to Mehsana sub-jail.
 
 Additional   Hasumati Modi said the judge relied upon the dying declaration of Suryaben where she had named the eight accused. Modi said on October 22, 2015, after a quarrel with in-laws, Viram pulled her by the hair into the house.
 
  While he held her, the others doused her in kerosene and set her ablaze. She died on October 28. Viram was addicted to liquor and often beat his wife. He had sold about 50 goats owned by her parents but refused to pay the money. This led to a quarrel between the couple.
