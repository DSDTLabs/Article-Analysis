Panaji: The anti-corruption branch (ACB) of the Goa police on Wednesday found matka slips and books at the residence and office of opposition leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’   during their investigation into his disproportionate  .

 “During Saturday’s search of Kavlekar’s house, the ACB team had found a closed office room inside the property,” police sources said, adding that this room, along with others was sealed and attached.
 
 “On Wednesday, after taking due permission from the court and with a copy of the order, the ACB team raided the office and attached thousands of matka slips and certain documents and registers showing that somebody was running a full-fledged matka business from the premises,” police sources said.
 
 The team was led by police inspector Vishwesh Karpe.
 
 Earlier, ACB teams had seized important documents from Kavlekar’s house and offices in Quepem and Margao. This is the fifth raid by the ACB since it launched its investigation into the case in 2010.
 
 The ACB has noted down details of furniture and vehicles owned by Kavlekar. The police have already registered an FIR in the matka case following a high court order asking police to probe a possible nexus between politicians and police. The court directives had come after activist Kashinath Shetye filed a petition before the court.
 
 Kavlekar’s parents and wife were reportedly prohibited from leaving the residence and using their phones during the entire duration of the raid.
 
 Police were also posted on all entry and exit points of the palatial bungalow at Betul.
