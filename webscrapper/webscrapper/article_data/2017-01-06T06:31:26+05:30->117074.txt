NEW DELHI: Domestic flyers will now have to wait till March to know how punctual airlines really are before making choices based on this consideration. 

  (DGCA) publishes on time performance (OTP) of airlines based on their domestic flights from four metros every month. But it has now discovered that it may not have been computed correctly and   chief B S Bhullar has formed a panel to go into this issue.
 
 “In view of some discrepancy observed in computation of OTP data, DGCA has constituted a committee to look into the matter to ensure the correctness by end of February. In the meantime, OTP data for December, 2016, will be published as per practice,” said Bhullar. 
 
 This means that correct OTP data of airlines can be expected only from March or April at the earliest.
 
 The issue of OTP has been a hotly contested one between airlines on one hand and airlines and airports on the other. The monthly data given by DGCA has become an important deciding factor when it comes to people choosing an airline based on its punctuality.   had recently complained of irregularities in OTP calculation at   and had sought a probe into the data collection.
