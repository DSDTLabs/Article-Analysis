CHENNAI: Experts have welcomed efforts made by the government to enforce and uphold better   besides asking more application-oriented questions in the   exams.

 
  
 
 According to official data, from 2.8 lakh, the number of students who have scored less than 700 has gone up to 3.4 lakh. This means almost 40% of the students who appeared in the exams got less than 60%.
 
 Rather than being lenient, the government adopted strict guidelines and this has brought out the real picture, say educationists.
 
 K Devarajan, former director of Tamil Nadu directorate of government examinations, said previously most questions pushed students towards rote learning practices and earlier attempts to standardise were opposed.
 
 “This year, the government has managed to strike a balance by introducing many creative and application-based questions and has avoided criticism by ensuring that slow learners also cleared the tests. If the same trend continue for the next three four years, our students will find national-level competitive exams easier,” he added. 
 
 This year, many students found the maths and chemistry papers tough. “A sudden jump in number of ‘just-pass’ students makes it evident that instructions were given to evaluators to provide grace marks to students who have failed by one to five marks,” said a maths teacher from a government school in Coimbatore.
 
 “The number of centum has come down in not only science but also commerce, accountancy and language papers. Though it is logical not to advertise toppers, not releasing names denies a scope for target or moral boost for other students,” said S Vishalakshi from TN Private Matriculation Schools Association.
 
 On the contrary, educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said there was no change in the evaluation time and standards and students found the exams tough because they had to focus on competitive exams. “Without changing learning methods or pedagogy, how can we expect a change in evaluation standards,” he asked.
