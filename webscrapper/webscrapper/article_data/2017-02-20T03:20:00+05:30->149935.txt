Nagpur: Lack of awareness among locals and particularly failure of the forest department and district administration to take corrective steps is taking toll on sarus cranes in Gondia-Balaghat districts. In the last 20 days, three sarus cranes have died due to consuming insecticide-infected crop in nursery beds in villages falling in the patch between Gondia-Balaghat. Another adult male was found dead on Sunday at Wainganga river bed. On February 1, a sub-adult and an adult sarus crane had died in Linga after consuming crop. This is the time when farmers, having good irrigation facilities, take second crop and spray insecticides for speedy growth. “During rainy season, the toll is less due continuous rains, but in dry season when sarus birds descend on the agriculture field to eat insects on crop, the pesticides prove to be a death knell,” said Sawan Bahekar of Sustaining Environment and Wildlife Assemblage (SEWA), Gondia. The majestic tall birds are found only in Gondia-Balaghat and Bhandara in Maharashtra. However, roosting and breeding places near agriculture fields, river beds, lakes and other habitat areas make them vulnerable. There is no special programmes or awareness drives by the forest and district administration against use of pesticides among farmers to conserve the bird species.  “The farmers may not be doing it intentionally but awareness among them can help save the birds,” said Bahekar.  Sarus cranes are listed in Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and their status is ‘vulnerable’ on International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Though the life cycle of these birds is 70-75 years, due to habitat destruction, their numbers are dwindling drastically. During the annual count named ‘Sarus Scape’, 82 sarus cranes were recorded. Of these, 35 and two cranes were sighted respectively in Gondia and Bhandara districts and 45 in adjoining Balaghat.
