  : For the first time, the   have laid eggs on the 2-km stretch from Podampeta to New Podampeta near the  . 

 The turtles have already started nesting in their old rookery from Purunabandh to Gokharakuda, said divisional forest officer (Berhampur) Ashish Kumar Behera. The turtles have laid 3.72 lakh eggs in the rookery, he added. 
 
 Forest officials are facing difficulties in protecting the eggs in the new areas as they had not fenced the area and deployed their personnel. The forest officials had only fenced the old rookery site of four km.
 
 "Now we have started fencing the new mass nesting site," said the DFO. The government has sanctioned around Rs 4 lakh for it, he said. The area would be fenced to prevent dogs, jackal, crow and other animals and birds as well as visitors from entering the area. Around 45 volunteers along with several forest personnel have been deployed to protect the eggs in the new areas, he added.
 
 Good condition of the beach, favourable weather condition as well as availability of sufficient space in the beach to facilitate digging of pits are some of the reasons for the record mass nesting, the DFO said.
 
 In 2015, over 3.09 lakh turtles had laid the eggs in the rookery, while in 2013 around 2.88 lakh eggs had been laid, official sources said. All previous records of mass nesting by the Olive ridleys have been surpassed this time, said the DFO.
 
  Last year, the rookery had worn a deserted look as the mass nesting of the turtles did not take place. Climbing the sandy beach, the female turtle dig pit in the sand first and lay eggs. The pit was covered by the mother turtles before they disappear in the deep sea. Around 100 to 150 eggs are laid by each female turtle. The mother turtle do not wait to see the hatchlings emerge after 45 to 50 days of nesting.
