PUNE: The summer   has begun taking its toll before even April has set in. A fire, suspected to have started due to the heat, on Monday burnt heaps of dry waste collected for recycling at a   ( ) treatment plant in Koregaon Park.

 Fire officer Vijay Bhilare said, “We received a call about the fire at 10.36am on Monday. We went to the spot with one fire tender and brought the fire under control within 15 minutes. The location is a PMC dry waste compaction plant run by a contractor. The extreme heat may have caused the fire.”
 
 However, the risk was not over with that. “It took nearly three more hours to cool the place. There were large heaps of dry leaves collected and kept there for recycling. These would be crushed and compacted into blocks, to be used to fire up large water boilers at hotels and other buildings,” he explained.
 
 “As the embers around the heaps were small, it took more time to cool the heaps before the smoke died out completely,” Bhilare said.
