MARGAO: Since the last eight months now, the A-class   (MMC) has been functioning without an accountant. Sources said that the tax superintendent has been handling the additional charge of accountant since May 2017, when the regular accountant was deputed to the office of the directorate of municipal administration ( ). 

 To worsen matters, the accounts-cum-taxation officer has been on sick leave since the last few weeks, thereby leaving only the accounts-cum-administrative officer as the go-to person for the public visiting the municipality for various matters. 
 
 “Employees of the taxation section are engaged in revenue recovery exercise and the audit exercise, too, is underway. With two senior officials of this section engaged in other pressing administrative matters, routine work of processing of files is getting hampered,” sources within the council said. 
 
 Sources said that though the accountant was moved to DMA office for just three months, it has led to an inordinate vacancy in the taxation section. When contacted, MMC vice-chairperson   said the matter has already been brought to the notice of the DMA with a request to send back the accountant. “ This is one section which gets a huge number of visitors for matters pertaining to trade license, house tax, etc. People are blaming us for the inconvenience owing to the over-burdened taxation section. There are many other vacancies, too, which need to be filled, for which we have asked for the DMA’s approval. Shortage of manpower has severely crippled he MMC,” he said.
