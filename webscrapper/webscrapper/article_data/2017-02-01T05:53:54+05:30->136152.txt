KOLHAPUR: The dwindling business of   needs a push through  , demanded the   makers from the city ahead of the 2017 Union  .

 In last couple of years, the manufacture and sale of handmade chappals have gone down owing to the Go-Vansh Hatya Bandi — ban on slaughter of cow progeny extending to bulls and bullocks. The industry with over 8,000 manpower faced double whammy due to demonetisation, taking the businesses down by 40% to 60%.
 
 Bhupal Shete, a chappal maker, said, “Every year, a petition of demands is sent to the Prime Minister and chief minister. However, the petitions are hardly addressed properly. We demand reduction in indirect taxes such as sales tax imposed on the product. Our product is totally handmade and the number of people involved in its manufacturing is large. We have also demanded a training centre or college in the city to help youths to take up the industry forward.”
 
 The average annual turnover of Kolhapuri Chappal industry is around Rs 15 crore and owing to the cash crunch after demonetisation, the turnover will be reduced by at least Rs 4 crore this year.
 
 Some chappal   claim the neighbouring states of Karnataka and Gujarat is giving subsidies up to 40% for helping the chappal industry survive. Also, leather boards from the respective states provide raw materials to the chappal makers.
 
 Last year, the central government increased the excise duty over leather products thereby halting the prospects of small traders eying exports of their product. Last time the duty rates were slashed was in 2012.
 
 Rambhau Satpute, a chappal maker from Jawahar Nagar said, “At other places the leather is provided at cheapest possible rates and made available easily by the governments. Cheaper chappals from these places are flooding the Kolhapur market and adversely affecting the small traders and manufacturers making quality and original chappals.”
