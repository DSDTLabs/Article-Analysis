NEW DELHI: Dhir Jhingran, a former IAS officer of the 1986 batch, has quit as member of Delhi government’s state advisory council for education in solidarity with chief secretary  , amid rumours that V K Jain, adviser to  , may also resign.

 Before taking VRS in 2012, Jhingran served as principal secretary in Assam government and as a director with the Union ministry of human resources.
 
 In his resignation letter, Jhingran wrote that the alleged assault on CS had shocked and saddened him. “This is to inform you that I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the reprehensible incident that took place on Monday night at the CM’s residence where Anshu Prakash, who is also my batchmate in the IAS, was assaulted.” 
 
 He further wrote: “As a matter of protest and in solidarity with Prakash, I also do not want to associate with a government that treats senior officers in this manner. I have resigned from the membership of the council with effect from February 20.” 
 
 Later, speaking to TOI, Jhingram said: “I really like the work of the AAP government in the education sector. That is why I agreed to be a part of the state advisory council.”
 
 City bureaucrats have vowed to boycott all meetings with the executive till Kejriwal apologises for the alleged assault on CS. Sources in the government, however, played down the significance of Jhingran’s resignation. “There are several advisory councils in different departments of the government. A retired officer resigning from the membership of one of the many councils does not hold any critical significance for the government,” a source said. 
 
 Sources also claimed that the state advisory council for education was not even regularly holding its meetings, so the resignation of a member wouldn’t have much of an impact. 
 
 Jain, the CM’s adviser, had on Thursday told police that he witnessed two MLAs — Amanatullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal — hitting the chief secretary.
