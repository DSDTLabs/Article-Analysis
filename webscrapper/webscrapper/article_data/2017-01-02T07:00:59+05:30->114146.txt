CHENNAI: MDMK's   has taken exception to   judge S Vaidyanathan's recent observations on former Tamil Nadu CM J  's “mysterious“ death.

 Issuing notice to the PM and the state and central governments, besides others, on December 29, Justice Vaidyanathan, heading a vacation bench, had asked, “Why can't we order   of the body of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa?“ 
 
 “Saying that Jayalalithaa's body should be exhumed, is most unwarranted, most unfortunate,“ said Vaiko. “I express my regret and dissent. He is a judge, but there should be a limit,“ he added.
 
 The vacation bench, also including Justice V Parthiban, had also rapped the Centre, saying, “You went there, but you have not reported anything. You knew everything but reported nothing for reasons best known to you...“ 
 
 Vaiko said Jayalalithaa's funeral at Marina beach had been attended by several dignitaries, including President Pranab Mukherjee and PM Narendra Modi. “The judge has now raised a doubt... and issued notices to   hospital and others. Did Apollo hospital doctors hush it up? Did AIIMS doctors hush it up? Did Dr Richard Beale hush it up?“ asked Vaiko.
