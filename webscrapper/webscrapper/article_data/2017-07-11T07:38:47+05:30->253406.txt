MANGALURU: Though there has been no fresh violence, cops deployed from other districts are getting increasingly frustrated with prohibitory orders in place in four taluks of  , Puttur, Sullia and Belthangady -for more than a month now.

 A majority of the cops, who are here on a week-long duty, will get a week's break before they report to their respective stations across the state. They are, however, relieved only if a replacement from their district or station arrives.
 
 Compounding their woes is the   of Rs 70. While some said food was provided to them where they are posted, others claimed they get breakfast, evening tea and one time food (provided by the department at the check post).
 
 “We leave our families for weeks together and in case of emergencies we have no other recourse but to pray to God,“ said a head constable from Chikkaballapur who arrived here on Friday after a week's break.
 
 Adding to their problems are the   where they are putting up. “I will never want my children to join police force. This is a thankless job without any duty hours and leave. We have leave, but we don't get it when we want,“ he said.
 
 Not all are complaining though. “We know what the job entails. Sometimes we have stayed months together in villages,“ said a head constable from Bagepalli. The outpost duty is for 12 hours -8am to 8pm or 8pm to 8am.
 
 
 
 A Muslim fruit vendor had come to the rescue of an injured   the day he was attacked and had rushed him to a hospital. On being informed by neighbouring shop owner Praveen, Abdul Rahouf, who was offering prayers in his shop, rushed to Sharath's shop. “We were like brothers and never let religion come between us,“ Rahouf said.
