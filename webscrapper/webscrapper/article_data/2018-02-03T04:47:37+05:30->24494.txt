NEW DELHI: A contentious bill to ban cow slaughter and ensure stabilisation of the Indian breed of bovine population was withdrawn by   MP   in the  , after the government urged him to do so.

 But Swamy asked the government to put a voluntary cess to ensure that cows are looked after well after they cease to give milk.
 
 During the discussion on the private member’s bill —The Cow Protection Bill 2017 — the Rajya Sabha witnessed heated exchanges when opposition MPs objected to railway minister   saying that such a serious issue was being “made fun of”. Goyal’s comment came after   member Javed Ali Khan spoke on it. 
 
 Khan said cow should be declared the national animal and provisions must be made to make the government responsible for rearing and nourishment of cows. He also said India must end its diplomatic ties with countries which trade in beef.
 
 Intervening in the debate, agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh said over the past three and half years, the government has been working on various schemes related to welfare of cows.
 
 Swamy said, “I wanted a law to come, but want the government to seriously consider putting a voluntary cess for the purpose of ensuring that cows are looked af- ter.” 
 
 He said ‘gaushalas’ (cow shelters) should be set up and scientifically run. An authority to ensure stabilisation of population of cows should also be set up.
 
 Swamy said, “Cow eating was not prevalent during the Mughal period. The last empire was in 1857 when the first thing Bahadur Shah Zafar declared was a ban on cow slaughter.” 
 
 He added, “The first anti-cow slaughter bill passed was in Madhya Pradesh ...all these   people, including Dr  , were in the forefront saying that cow should be give a special place and its killing should be banned.”
