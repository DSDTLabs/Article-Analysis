MYSURU:   leader S A   said that he will be holding a protest in front of the DC office on Thursday demanding judicial probe into the fake applications submitted at booth offices to delete BJP voters’ names from the list.

 Ramadas visited Jyothi Composite PU Science College in Kuvempunagar on Wednesday where he displayed Form 7 (application for objecting inclusion or seeking deletion of name in electoral roll) which was submitted at the college office.
 
 The teaching staff of the college has been selected as Block Level Officers (BLOs) whose duty is to verify whether the details mentioned in the applications are correct by visiting each house.
 
 Ramadas alleged that miscreants supported by   have filled these forms and submitted at the college office.
 
 “Around 80 fake forms found in the college office were filled by a single person. The same person has signed on the columns meant for voter’s signature as well as BLO’s signature. All the addresses mentioned in the applications are of BJP voters. The reason mentioned for deletion was change of residence to other constituency,” he said.
 
 Ramadas alleged that MCC revenue inspector Narayanaswamy was involved in the submission of fake applications. “The final list of voters list will be announced in March and if these fake applications are not verified, then BJP voters’ names will be deleted from the list,” he said.
 
  said that Narayanaswamy had handed over the forms to them. “He handed over the forms and asked us to conduct door-to-door check to prevent repetition of names. But when we questioned about our (BLOs) signatures on the forms, he said the forms were given by the assistant commissioner and they just have to verify and submit them,” he said.
 
 Ramadas said he has already brought the issue to the notice of deputy commissioner D Randeep.
