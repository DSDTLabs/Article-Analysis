SURAT: Sheela Rana and Nimisha Rana, the   for   that claimed the lives of six people in the city were not included in the list of bootleggers by the police despite they being in the   for the past many years. Surprisingly, the women had been arrested three times for bootlegging and still did not figure among the listed bootleggers, sources claimed. Police confirmed that the women used to sell Indian Made Foreign Liquor and add homeopathic medicine to prepare liquor.

 City police commissioner   has ordered all the police stations to update their list of bootleggers and to keep a close eye on all those involved in the illegal trade of liquor. “We are checking if the accused were arrested in the past on bootlegging charges. I have asked all the police stations in the city to update their list of bootleggers if they had not done already,” Sharma said.
 
 Police maintain a list of notorious bootleggers operating in different police station areas to keep a check on their activities by carrying out regular raids on their premises. Police widely use the term listed bootleggers in the legal documents. However, majority of the police stations have failed to update the list of bootleggers even when a few of them had died, sources said. 
 
 Senior cops have been asked to verify if the accused women duo was arrested for bootlegging or not. The antecedents of the accused are being checked. So far, six junior-level cops of Katargam police station have been suspended following an inquiry in the issue.
