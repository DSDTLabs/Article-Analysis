SURAT: Alpesh Thakor, president of  , was in the city on Saturday to meet relatives of the victims of the recent   and express his community’s anger with regard to police’s functioning.

 Thakor who alleged at a press conference at around 11am that police and politicians take ‘hafta’ later at 1pm claimed that the police were making efforts to detect the hooch case. There was change in his tone after he met city police commissioner Satish Sharma. Thakor blamed government for not providing enough staff to city police and said this is why there was an in-charge police inspector posted at Katargam police station where the recent hooch tragedy took place.
 
 “It is second hooch tragedy in Surat within six months and it shows police’s failure. A new prohibition law was introduced due to our efforts but it is not being properly implemented. The earlier law too was not implemented properly,” said Thakor, who met the relatives of the deceased who died in Katargam after consuming spurious liquor. 
 
 Thakor claimed that they had given a list of liquor dens to the police who too knew about notorious bootleggers, but are hesitant to take any action. “This government is useless. No officer has been held responsible for the hooch deaths. We will start Janata raid from February 1 if no action against liquor dens is taken by the police,” Thakor said in the morning.
 
 However, Thakor’s tone changed once he met the police commissioner. He looked satisfied with the police action in the matter. “Police are doing good investigation and four persons were nabbed for their involvement in the case. There was an in-charge police inspector at Katargam police station when the tragedy happened. The state government should give police adequate number of officers to improve their efficiency,” he said.
 
 “We gave details of the investigation and also answered other queries of Thakor. We have already ordered an   to find out if they were negligent in discharging their duties,” Sharma said.
