 A case has been registered against Prabhu Lal and others. Police have collected FSL samples and finger prints of the accused.

 “Hanuman was a student and his father Rup Narayan had retired recently. They had asked Prabhu Lal to find an amicable solution to the problem. However, Lal was adamant for revenge,” the official said.
 
 Rup Narayan died on the spot while Hanuman succumbed to his injures in the hospital, police said.
