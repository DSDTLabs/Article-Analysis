AHMEDABAD: Around 2.5 lakh primary school teachers in Ahmedabad represented before the state education department, seeking to relieve them from additional duties. At present, primary school teachers are given additional duties which include those at elections, household registrations, making changes in voters list among others. There are 37 additional duties other than teaching where primary school teachers are engaged. With this, 100 out of 365 days of their tenure in a year is spent merely on such duties. The same was learnt from the outcome of the ‘Chintan Shibir’ organized by state government.

 Even experts are of the opinion that the additional duties of primary school teachers must be reduced so that they can focus on teaching. Since a significant amount of time of the primary school teachers is being wasted, the state education department has taken the issue seriously.
 
 Further commenting on the issue, state education minister,  , said, “We are concerned about the issue and even experts have suggested that primary school teachers should be given no additional duties other than those for elections. Teachers must get adequate time to focus on teaching.”
 
 According to information provided by well-placed sources in the state education department, teachers are also engaged in activities such as Lok Mela and  , among others. In fact, engaging teachers in any given activity is violation of the law.
 
 Explaining this,  , former president,  , said, “If primary school teachers are supposed to be engaged in any activity other than teaching, necessary permission must be sought from the state education department. However, the same isn’t being implemented this indicating that this is in violation of the law.”
