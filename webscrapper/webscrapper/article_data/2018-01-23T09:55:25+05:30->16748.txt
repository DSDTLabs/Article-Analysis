NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday sought the disqualification of 116 BJP MLAs in Madhya Pradesh (MP), who it claims are holding offices of profit.

 This demand comes days after Election Commission (EC) recommended   in Delhi be disqualified for the same reason; the President gave his nod to the disqualification.
 
 AAP’s MP convener, Alok Agarwal tweeted that his party had raised the issue a year and a half ago, but no action was taken by the poll panel.
 
 
  
 “We complained to the EC earlier as well, but no hearing was done on it. We will now once again bring it to the notice of newly appointed governor in MP. We will request her to take it up on priority,” Agarwal told reporters.
 
 Agarwal specifically named two BJP MLAs in the state, Paras Jain and Deepak Joshi, who according to him are profiting from their offices more than anyone else. He further alleged that there were two separate laws in the country, one for BJP-governed states and another for states ruled by other political parties.
 
 “In almost all states where BJP is in power, MLAs get   posts. It is quite clear that there is one law that allows BJP to wallow into corruption while there is another that discourages honest leaders of AAP against stopping BJP from doing corruption,” said Agarwal.
