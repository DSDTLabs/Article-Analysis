ROHTAK: Distancing himself from the   call given by   (HPCC) president  , former chief minister   on Friday said he was not aware of any such plan by the party’s state unit. 

 Hooda, who was addressing a press conference at his residence in Rohtak on Friday, said neither he nor his MLAs were aware of any such call given by HPCC chief Ashok Tanwar. 
 
 Attacking the BJP government, Tanwar had said the party leaders and MLAs planned to gherao the state assembly over issues of Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal and corruption on March 7.
 
 Regarding factionalism in the party, Hooda said it was an internal matter of Congress and the party would resolve it amicably. 
 
 Responding to demands raised by his group of MLAs to replace Tanwar as party chief, the former CM said they had asked for withdrawal of a false case against him but the media distorted the statement. 
 
 On the row of authorisation of red beacon on vehicle of the former chief minister, Hooda said he was authorised to use the beacon as per notification of state government in 2014. “If anyone has an issue with the notification, they can get it withdrawn,” he said. 
 
 Unperturbed by the burning of his effigies by Tanwar's supporters, he said, “Burning of effigies only add up years in one’s life”.
