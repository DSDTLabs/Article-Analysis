PATNA: The   ( ), Bihar’s lone reserved forest area for big cats, has got four elephants from  . The tuskers will be used for patrolling and rescuing purposes in the tiger reserve in West Champaran district.

 The elephants will be trained for a month to help them adapt to the new environ and habitat. “The four male elephants are aged 8, 9, 11 and 13 years. They have been brought from the  , also a tiger reserve,” said VTR-1 divisional forest officer Gaurav Ojha on Monday.
 
 The tuskers were transported in a truck from Karnataka to VTR. The journey took six days. A Karnataka mahout, who accompanied the tuskers, will train them for a month. “Later, local mahouts will take care of the elephants,” Ojha said.
 
 The VTR had so far only one elephant, Rupa, which mostly resides in Madanpur range in VTR. It is also used by forest rangers for patrolling and rescuing purposes.
 
 “Trained elephants are helpful in capturing stray tigers because experts, who tranquillise the tigers before catching them, can go near the tigers riding an elephant and aim better from a height,” Ojha said and added elephants were also helpful in patrolling the terrains where vehicles could not go.
 
 Officials said the VTR, given its geography, should ideally have 16 elephants for patrolling purposes. “We plan to bring more elephants from places like Andaman, but it may take some time,” Ojha said.
 
 The number of big cats at VTR is likely to surge up to 40 as per a recent census conducted by the forests department. The third annual census at VTR was completed in March last year and its final report is awaited.
