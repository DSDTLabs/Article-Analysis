AURANGABAD: After a   of seven years, over 15,000 residents around   are not facing   in   

 The civic authorities said the water level of the lake, located on the outskirts of the city, was 9 ft on Thursday and they have been lifting water without any disruption. 
 
 A satisfactory spell of rainfall in the last monsoon season and the recent desilting of the lake has ensured uninterrupted water supply. Apart from this, meticulous planning and judicious use of the available resources has meant that the residents will be able to rely on the lake water till mid-June. 
 
 Municipal authorities told TOI that there is very little possibility of the lake drying up in the coming days. “As of now, there is enough water in the lake to last till mid-June. If we receive monsoon showers on time, we will continue lifting water from the lake,” said Kiran Dhande, sectional engineer in   (AMC). 
 
 Dhande said the lake water offers big relief to the local residents, who otherwise grapple with severe water scarcity during peak summer. The water filtration plant near Maulana Azad College is dedicated to purify water lifted from Harsul lake. 
 
 Although the city is mainly dependent on Jayakwadi dam that supplies about 125 million litres of water a day (MLD), the civic body also lifts 4 to 5 MLD water from the lake for supply to nearby localities. Interestingly, this year, the municipal authorities began lifting Harsul lake water quite late in December. That is one of the reasons that the water stock has lasted till peak summer. 
 
 The lake is a major source of water for the residents in 20 municipal wards in the old city, including Shahganj, Lota Karanja and Roshan Gate. For the last few years, the lake would get dried up in February-March every year.
 
 But after, the municipal authorities removed silt from the lake and increased its storage capacity in the last season, enough water is available. The civic body removed silt from 300 square feet area of the lake bed.
