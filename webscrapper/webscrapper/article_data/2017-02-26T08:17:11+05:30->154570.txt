CHENNAI: The quality of research at   is set to get better with students able to choose from more guides from among the faculty. Even faculty members on probation can offer guideship, a resolution passed by the   on Saturday said. 

 The resolution came at a meeting presided by council chairman Thangam Menon. The matter had been a sore point for years with faculty members, including assistant professors and professors, who were unable to offer doctoral guideship to students as their probations were pending indefinitely. 
 
  (MUTA) general secretary G Ravindran said they had been fighting for the   to all newly recruited faculty members for more than two years. Guideship, he said, was denied on the ground that such members had to complete their probation. As long as they have been hired to fill vacancies for permanent faculty members they should be eligible to provide guideship, MUTA had argued.
 
 After a black flag demonstration by the association in December last year in this regard, the university administration issued probation completion certificates and cleared some guideship applications. 
 
 "However, several cases remained unresolved for other reasons such as lack of required teaching experience, absence of school board chairperson to sign the papers, etc.," he said. 
 
 Saturday's resolution now means students can pursue doctoral studies under the professors of their choice. In the long term, this will not only help the university churn out more research, but also increase chances of promotions for faculty members under probation.
 
  The current system at the university now says faculty members can be eligible for promotions only if they assist a said number of projects, offering guideship to students.
 
 Ravindran also urged the university to adopt the UGC (Minimum Standards for the award of MPhil/PhD) Regulations 2016, which he says would address several M Phil and PhD related processes.
