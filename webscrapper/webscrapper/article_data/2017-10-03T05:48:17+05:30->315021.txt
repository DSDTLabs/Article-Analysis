CHENNAI: The Madras high court has again made it clear that government agencies cannot regularise buildings constructed in violation of norms such as setback rules. 

 The court on Monday asked Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority ( ),   and the housing and urban development department to take punitive action against and move out of their posts all officials who helped grant amnesty to owners of such buildings.
 
 A division bench of   and Justice R   issued the direction while disposing of two petitions seeking to stop demolition of portions of buildings in Choolaimedu and   that officials said violated setback norms.
 
  The Madras HC had in October 2015 ruled that the government could not entertain applications for regularisation of illegal buildings unless it first framed and notified relevant rules.
