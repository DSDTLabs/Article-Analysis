AJMER: The   (ADA) has expressed concern over illegal slaughter houses and meat shops in the city and asked the district collector to take action against unhygienic abattoirs. The authority also suggested constructing a separate meat market in the city for the public's health safety. 

 A Vishva Hindu Parishad ( ) delegation met the chairman of ADA, Shiv Shanker  , on Thursday and called for a ban on meat sellers operating on ADA land as vendors or from vehicles.
 
 "The concern relates to health problems of all citizens, whether they eat meat or not. Therefore, I have asked the district administration to act on this issue," said Heda.
 
 In a letter written to district administration, ADA said that these shops were not following the health security index and selling poor quality meat in summer, affecting the health of people.
 
 These shops do not have freezers required to keep the meat clean and healthy. "The main issue is that the meat is kept in the open. This increases germs and insects and spreads diseases," the letter said.
 
 Ajmer is a tourist destination and thousands of tourists come to the city daily. So, meat hanging from shops is not a good sight for them, the letter claimed.
 
 "Those who do not eat meat feel bad about seeing it kept in the open. Our aim is to set up the row of meat shops in a more systematic way so that it do not disturb people," Heda said.
 
 The agency has also opposed hens being kept and transported in cages in large numbers, alleging that it amounts to violation of animal rights.
 
 They have called for checking licences of meat shops, closing illegal ones in the city immediately and preventing them from selling spoiled meat by following the norms. "It's better to have a separate market for selling meat," the letter said.
 
 Meanwhile, VHP has threatened to hold protests if such activities are not stopped immediately in the city.
