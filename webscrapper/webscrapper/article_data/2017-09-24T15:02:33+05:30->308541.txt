KOZHIKODE: Former Vice-President Hamid Ansari said the woman has an independent juridical personality in Islam, and the principle of equality and justice between men and women in terms of their rights and obligation was emphatically stated in the Quran. 

 He was speaking after inaugurating the seminar on 'Role of Women in Making a Humane Society', organized jointly by the   and National Women's Front at Nalanda Auditorium here on Saturday.
 
 "The equality bestowed by faith was diluted by tradition and practice and replaced by subjugation. An obvious result of this was overt and covert misogyny, so vividly reflected in proverbs relating to women in most languages in use in the Muslim societies," he said.
 
 The current state of affairs was clearly contrary to the tenets of faith, he observed. "It is unethical and harmful to the individuals and the community. It must change. Only then can women, as equal partners, participate in the creation of society that is humane," he said.
 
  (PFI) chairman E Aboobacker, Institute of Objective Studies, Kozhikode chapter co-ordinator, P Koya, National Women's Front president A S Sainaba and others attended the event.
 
 The seminar had grabbed headlines after   denied permission to host the programme.
 
 Meanwhile,   asked Ansari to apologise to the nation for participating in a programme conducted by the 'anti-national organization PFI.' In a statement issued here, BJP spokesperson   said PFI was a recruiting agent of international terror outfit.
