NEW DELHI:   has threatened a nationwide campaign against the high price of petrol in the country. Senior party member   on Tuesday said that the party would hold an emergency meeting of all MLAs and district heads on Wednesday in Delhi and chalk out a strategy for the campaign.

 “When the BJP-led government came to power in the Centre, the price of crude oil in the international market was $105.5 per barrel while the price of petrol was Rs 71 per litre in Delhi. Since Narendra Modi became the PM, the international price of petrol has more than halved but the price of petrol in Delhi has increased,” Rai said.
 
 He added: “We will launch a social media campaign against the petrol prices, tagging the PM in all our messages.”
