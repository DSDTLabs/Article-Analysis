ZIRAKPUR: The residents of   on the VIP Road here have set an example by clearing an enormous amount of domestic waste and debris from a large plot without any help from the civic body.

 They had to convince the plot owner and the nearby shopkeepers and restaurant businesses to let them use a hired bulldozer and three trucks to clear the heaps of garbage, construction debris, and kitchen waste that come from these restaurants, shops, and nearby housing societies. 
 
 The work started on Tuesday with the participation of eight residents, who have scooped the filth and swept it to the rear of the plot, where it was dumped in a large pit that has been dug to accommodate all the garbage from the plot. "This place had become an eyesore for us and we did not know what to do,"   Towers president Asish   said. Lying next to Gate 1 of the society, which is near a market, the plot is along a road that the society residents take daily.
 
 The smell from a mountain of garbage that had built up was a constant source of discomfort. Even the tall grass and thick undergrowth had added to the problems. People used to urinate on the spot and, after sunset, drunkards used to gather there. "We couldnt wait longer to take action," Mathew said. To prevent further dumping of domestic waste at the spot, the restaurant workers and shopkeepers joined the society guards in patrolling the plot after dark.
 
 The residents also installed signs around the plot to tell the public that the dumping of garbage at the spot is forbidden. The mouth of the road has been cleared of food vendors who used to cause traffic logjams. Speaking to TOI, Mathew said: "We are now thinking of asking the plot owners to get the land fenced and turn this spot into a children's park eventually or a parking lot. The lot will help reduced the congestion on the VIP Road." The residents expect the cleaning of the plot to finish in two or three days.
