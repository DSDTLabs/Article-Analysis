Kolkata: Residents within Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation limits will soon be able to pay their property tax online. 

 Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta said, “We are working to introduce an online property tax payment service as early as possible.”
 
 According to officials, once the service is launched, citizens will not have to designate bank branches or stand in the queue where property tax payments are accepted. 
 
 “A property tax payment option will be there in the civic website. Debit card or net-banking can be used to pay dues,” an official said.
 
 Civic authorities are also working to introduce a mobile app that can be used to avail services like complaints and registering grievances. 
 
 At present, residents of Salt Lake are paying property tax at 12 private bank branches in various parts of Salt Lake and Rajarhat. 
 
 “Property tax bills for the last quarter have been sent to the 22,000 households in Salt Lake while the Rajarhat tax bills are being prepared,” another official said.
 
 According to officials, the civic body had earned around Rs 17 crore from property taxes in the 2016-17 financial year and has set a target of a total of Rs 58 crore in this fiscal.
