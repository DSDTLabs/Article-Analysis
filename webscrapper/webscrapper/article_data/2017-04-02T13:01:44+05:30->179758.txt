COIMBATORE: While farms and orchards across the state are struggling to survive one of the worst droughts in two decades, the   has a record-breaking production of   fruit.

 “We sold only Rs 3.5-lakh worth fruits last year. This year, 3,150 kg fruits were sold for Rs 11 lakh,” farm manager K Palanisamy told TOI.
 
 The farm, which has 205 mangosteen trees, saw almost 155 of them bear fruits this year. “This is close to double the fruits we got last year. Only 82 trees bore fruits last year and the production was extremely low,” he said.
 
 “Though the fruiting season is traditionally from April to June, by March-end all the fruits reached plucking stage. The next fruiting season will only be during the monsoon,” Palanisamy said.
 
 The fruit, with a hard purple coloured outer shell and considered to be a powerful anti-oxidant, is produced twice a year — April to June and again from July to October. The last time the farm saw good sale of mangosteen was in 2014, when it sold Rs 7-lakh worth fruits. 
 
 The fruits are sold at Rs 350 per kilogram, with a kilogram having around eight to ten fruits. “This year, we floated a tender and sold the entire produce to a fruit wholesaler from  , who distributes it to places like Kerala, Kodaikanal and Kutralam,” said Palanisamy.
 
 The manager said that this year’s record production could be directly attributed to an increase in farm manure, better irrigation and more security for the trees. “We usually lose a lot of fruits to monkeys, but this time, we raised our fences and stationed people around the orchard to keep them away,” he said. 
 
 “Many fruits also keep falling down, so this time, we kept plucking them at the right time. Also, because of the drought prediction, we consciously increased the application of farm manure and ensured the trees were irrigated from the   river,” Palanisamy added.
