LUCKNOW: To increase transparency in the election process, the ECI has launched the   (ECRP) Scheme to assist candidates and political parties in filing nomination forms, affidavits and expenditure accounts, online. 

 After running successful pilots in Haryana and Delhi elections, the scheme was introduced for the first time in Uttar Pradesh. With ECI making it mandatory to e-file expenditure statements in order to bring transparency and uniformity in the process, ECRPs have been trained by the ECI and have been mandated with e-filing affidavits after filing the nomination and expenditure statements within 30 days of the declaration of results. Candidates can seek assistance from licensed ECRPs. So far, ECI has trained a batch of 59 ECRPs in UP.
 
 Tax Return Preparer and chartered accountant, Ujjwal Kapoor said, "We have set up a helpline for candidates to assist them with inquiries related to e-filing of statements of nomination and expenditure. SP's Lucknow Cantt candidate, Aparna Yadav, and Lucknow Central candidate, Brajesh Pathak were the first to get their forms filed by us."
