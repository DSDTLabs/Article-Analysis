BAMBOLIM : Goa Medical College ( ) and hospital, on Monday, opened the special facilitation desk — Arogya Mitra — that will cater to patients from Maharashtra visiting the state’s premier hospital for treatment.

 On Wednesday, following a meeting between Goa health minister   and Maharashtra chief minister  , the Maharashtra government decided to take GMC on-board as part of the hospitals empanelled under its   (MJPJAY), their state-run medical insurance scheme.
 
 Maharashtra government had directed the CEO of MJPJAY to set up the facilitation desk at GMC.
 
 Goa government’s decision to charge outstation patients from January 1 had created quite a furore with some politicians from Maharashtra complaining that patients from Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg district, who relied on GMC in the absence of a similar facility there, had been affected. Rane, however, had remained firm on the government decision.
 
 Rane inaugurated the counter on Monday morning in the presence of the hospital’s dean Dr Pradeep Naik, and other senior officials.
 
 The government took the decision to charge outstation patients at state-run hospitals, including the GMC and district hospitals, as it was discovered that the outstation patient load affected services to locals. However, emergency cases and outstation patients who could not afford treatment were not billed. As many as 30% of the total patients at GMC are outstation.
 
 In January, a delegation comprising   functionaries from Sindhudurg had met chief minister Manohar Parrikar in this regard.
 
 GMC’s revenue earning is expected to jump as the rates offered under the Maharashtra government’s scheme are higher than what the state’s premier hospital charges. The GMC charges 20% of the rates applicable at class ‘C’ hospital.
