AMRITSAR: Pakistan’s minority leadership has urged the government to take strict action against hatemongers following the recent spate in the vicious propaganda against ‘Nanakpanthis’ (Sindhi Hindus) in Tharparkar district of Sindh province. Most of the Hindus living in Sindh follow teachings of Sikhism and are also called ‘Nanakpanthis’.

 "Not only the social media is being used to propagate hatred against the minority community, but pamphlets are also being distributed in Tharparkar," Pakistan’s member of national assembly (MNA) Ramesh Kumar Vankwani told   over phone on Saturday. He said extremist elements were trying to create unrest in the peaceful society of Hindu-majority Mithi and Umarkot areas using anonymous social media accounts. "The hate pamphlets are written in Sindhi language and are being distributed on a large scale," he said, adding that these had the name of controversial Islamic cleric Pir Ayub Jan Sarhindi, believed to be involved in most cases related to forced conversions of minor Hindu and Sikh girls.
 
 Stating that minority communities in Pakistan were facing a lot of problems, Vankwani, who is also the patron-in-chief of the  , said that, "Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah during his address to the Constituent Assembly on August 11, 1947, had defined the state policy that one may belong to any religion or caste or creed, it had nothing to do with the business of the state." He, however, regretted that minorities were continuously being discriminated against.
 
 Vankwani said he, along with another minority MNA from Umarkot, Lal Chand Malhi, had asked the higher authorities to take immediate action before the extremist elements succeed in exploiting the religious sentiments of innocent people. He said both of them had also demanded an inquiry to expose the people behind distribution of the hate pamphlets. Vankwani said that the Federal Investigation Agency was the right forum to inquire against the misuse of social media.
