 Eyewitnesses said the sub-inspector Kirubakaran landed at a shop run by Abdul Rehman on Nungambakkam High Road and sought a bribe. When the owner refused, the   picked up a quarrel with him and also began abusing customers who came to the shop. 
 
 Rehman asked Kirubakaran to refrain from abusing his customers but the sub-inspector paid no heed, said witnesses. Subsequently, a few bystanders gathered around Kirubakaran and accosted him. Noticing this, another policeman who had accompanied him in the patrol vehicle threatened those present. 
 
 One of the customers then made a call to the police control room following which a senior police officer arrived at the spot. Kirubakaran was taken to a government hospital for a medical test to find out whether he was under the influence of alcohol. Based on a complaint from Rehman, an investigation is on.
 
 Shopkeepers in the area claimed that collection of bribes from roadside vendors is rampant under the limits of this police station.
 
 “We have received a complaint and a departmental inquiry has been ordered into the incident. Senior police officials will submit a report to higher-ups soon. Based on the report, action will be initiated,” said an investigating officer.
