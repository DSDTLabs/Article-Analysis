BENGALURU: Off the first ball of Punjab’s innings,   skipper   got Manan Vohra to edge to Karun Nair at first slip.  , 18, who watched from the non-striker’s end, shook his head.

 
 Gill, the vice-captain of the country’s U-19 World Cup-winning team, then waited for No. 3 batsman   to rotate the strike and for a little over three hours thereafter, held sway with an impeccable display of batsmanship. Gill’s unbeaten 122-ball-123 (8x4, 6x6) was the cornerstone of Punjab’s narrow four-run win over hosts Karnataka in their   Group ‘A’ encounter at the Alur (2) stadium here on Sunday.
 
 In an edge-of-the-seat contest, Indian opener   ended his campaign in the tournament with a 91-ball 107 (7x4; 5x6). In a match reduced to 42-overs-a-side due to a wet outfield, Punjab opted to bat and scored a competitive 269/3. Karnataka’s top-order — barring Rahul — failed to convert good starts. Needing 13 runs in the last over, Karnataka managed only eight, finishing at 265/8.
 
 Gill’s efforts though overshadowed Rahul’s century. For the first 10 overs, Mandeep (64, 76b, 4x4, 2x6) picked the singles and dispatched the odd loose ball to the fence. Gill, who amassed 372 runs in six outings at the World Cup, stuck to groundstrokes initially. But once the spinners came on, he showed his nimble footwork. He announced his intentions with a massive six off K Gowtham, carting the spinner over long-on in the 12th over. The duo then tore apart tweaker Praveen Dubey’s bowling, slamming 20 runs in the 22nd over, including three sixes.
 
 Vinay (2-40) ended their 125-run second wicket stand, but Gill continued to party in the company of skipper Yuvraj Singh (36, 28b, 4x4, 1x6) and later Gurkeerat Mann (35, 26b, 5x4). The aggressive Gill did not rely entirely on brute force, his precision with timing too played its part.
 
 Brief scores: Punjab 269/3 in 42 ovs (Shubman Gill 123*, Mandeep Singh 64) beat Karnataka 265/8 in 42 ovs (KL Rahul 107 S Kaul 3/47) by 4 runs
