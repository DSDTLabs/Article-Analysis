ATTARI/INDORE: It was a dream come true, but only in the virtual world, when Pakistani youngster   found his Indian lady love Sofia on a social networking site in 2011. Their love blossomed, Akbar and Sofia married and now have a two-year-old son Ariz. Then, visa rules came in the way.

 While sharing the happiest moments of his life with his family, Akbar jumped his visa and was put behind bars for over 18 months before being deported to his country on Wednesday, leaving behind Sofia and Ariz here. Before deportation, 31-year-old Akbar told TOI that he wanted to take his wife and son along but they were not given visas to travel to Pakistan.
 
 Disappointed, Akbar put up a brave front though he admits that he doesn’t know when his family would be together again. Some day, for sure, he said. 
 
 A resident of Okhri in Hyderabad district of Pakistan, Akbar was among 39 Pakistani nationals, including 18 fishermen, repatriated by India via the Attari land border on Wednesday. A masters in economics, Akbar said that he met Sofia, a resident of Dewas in  , on   in 2011. Two years later, they married but he was sentenced to one-year imprisonment in June 2016 for overstaying in India. Despite being released in July 2016, he was made to stay in a detention centre for about seven months for want of his travel documents, he said. “This was really cruel. I don’t understand why I was made to stay in the detention centre,” he said.
 
 On July 30, 2016, Dewas chief judicial magistrate Jitendra Singh Kushwah found Akbar guilty of staying in India after the visa issued to him expired on July 11, 2014. Akbar was arrested in August 2014, following intelligence inputs. Since the families of Sofia and Akbar knew each other, the marriage was held on January 23, 2013. He stayed on in India after the wedding but has paid a heavy price for it.
