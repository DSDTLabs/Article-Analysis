VISAKHAPATNAM: A   event was held for the first time in the city to celebrate Holi on Friday.

 Organisers were able to successfully run the show by procuring nearly 3.000 kg of tomatoes from neighbouring   district.
 
 Nearly a dozen farmers sold three tonnes of tomatoes for the Tomatina festival, where participants hurl tomatoes at each other. The tomatoes used in the festival are overripe ones which are unfit for consumption.
 
 Speaking to TOI, S Srinivas, a manager of   that hosted the show in association with Sri Durga Events at  , said they paid nearly Rs 4 to Rs 7 per kilo of overripe tomatoes to the farmers.
 
 “Nearly 900 participants right from school students to college-goers, and office-goers to businessmen took part in the Tomatina festival, which also included food and fun along with live music by two DJs from Bangalore,” Srinivas said.
 
 He further said they got good feedback from the participants and suggestions too. “We hope that we will come up with a similar event next year too if the time and situation permit us,” Srinivas added.
 
 K Priyanka, a Gitam student, said, “This Tomatina festival has created a new trend in Vizag.” Apart from the Tomatina festival, star hotels like The Park and   among others came up with special events like a rain dance to mark the Holi festive spirit.
