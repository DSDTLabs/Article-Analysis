KOLKATA: On a day illegal parking took centrestage after locals clashed with police in Sovabazar,   and the Kolkata Traffic Police teamed up to create 10 new parking lots, some of them in the most congested zones.

 The new lots have been sanctioned around central and north Kolkata at Chitpur, Mechhua Falpatti ( ), Burrabazar, Beadon Street and Shyambazar. A few parking lots in south and added areas are likely to be added to the list this week.
 
 “To keep unscrupulous syndicates in check, Kolkata Police wanted us to identify the areas where parking can be allowed legally. In other areas, they intend to carry out a crackdown. Accordingly, we are in the process of awarding tenders,” said MMiC (parking) Debasis Kumar.
 
 While traffic in the city is managed by police, parking remains in KMC’s domain. “We have regular meetings regarding parkings. Based on suggestions from both sides, we agreed to some parking lots,” said DC (traffic) Sumit Kumar.
 
 Police said they had information that the parking mafia was minting money, often with help from lower rung cops, in areas adjoining CR Avenue and Behala. “The identification of legal parking lots will help carry out a sustain campaign against illegal ones,” claimed another top IPS officer at Lalbazar.
