 seems to be spoilt for choice these days when it comes to the roles offered to him. 

 After a string of sombre characters in The Great Father, Streetlight and Ajai Vasudevan’s upcoming film, the megastar will be doing a naadan role for his next, directed by scriptwriter Sethu.
 
 The latest we hear about the project is that the movie will have three heroines. “We have discussed the script with Deepti Sati and are also considering Miya and Anu Sithara. However, we have not confirmed the actresses yet as the shoot will begin only in July,” says Sethu.
 The scriptwriter, who would be making his directorial debut with the yet-to-be-titled movie, adds, “Mammukka’s character is someone that you would spot in any village in Kerala. He’s unmarried and has only his father as family. He’s got a lot of vices but he’s also a fun character and the story is told with a lot of humour.”
 
 The team will begin recce soon with Kuttanad being the main location. The movie will also have actor Unni Mukundan working as an associate director.
 Meanwhile, Mammootty is currently shooting for Ajai’s film in which he plays a strict college professor.
