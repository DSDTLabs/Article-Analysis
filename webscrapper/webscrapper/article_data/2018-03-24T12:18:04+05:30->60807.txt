PATNA: A man carried his infant along with an Oxygen cylinder after the   (PMCH) allegedly failed to provide him a stretcher on Thursday.

 A video that went viral on Friday showed the baby of three months in his father Ravi Kumar’s arms and two relatives carrying an oxygen cylinder with a tube from it connected to the child as breathing support. Natives of Chhapra, they are seen moving from the paediatrics department towards the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC), both situated on the PMCH premises, for an Echocardiography test.
 
 The child was admitted to the paediatrics ward on March 19 following complaints of respiratory problem along with fever and cold. On Thursday, a paediatrician advised Echocardiography test, but the patient was not provided a stretcher trolley.
 
 State health minister   said the hospital was equipped with all the facilities and wondered why a stretcher could not be provided to the child. The PMCH superintendent has sent a show-cause notice to the paediatrics HoD, he said.
 
 PMCH superintendent Dr Deepak Tandon told this reporter a three-member committee has been formed to probe the matter. “I have asked the committee to submit its report within three days. Action will be taken on the basis of the probe report,” Dr Tandon said, adding he had not issued any show-cause notice to any doctor.
 
 Paediatric department’s officiating HoD Dr  , on the other hand, claimed the child’s attendants didn’t wait for a stretcher trolley due to urgency. Also, one Dr   accompanied them to the IGIC to ensure the test was done in time.
 
 The incident caused a storm in the state assembly as well with opposition RJD seeking action against the erring health authorities. “No ambulance, no stretcher... That’s the deadly condition of health in BJP-led Nitish government,” tweeted leader of opposition Tejaswi Prasad Yadav.
