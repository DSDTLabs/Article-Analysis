Surat: Close to 50 jewellers in Surat and Mumbai have been served with notices by the Goods and Service   ( ) department in connection with the tax evasion case worth Rs 650 crore involving a jewellery manufacturing unit in Mahidhapura.

 Sources said the investigation wing of GST department had raided the jewellery manufacturing firm located in Mahidhapura diamond market two months ago. During investigation, it was found that the firm had not registered under GST and they were doing job-work for other jewellers without issuing bills or invoices. 
 
 After two months of investigation and scrutinizing the seized documents, it was found that the unit owners have evaded tax to the tune of Rs 650 crore.
 
 Sources said the department gathered the details of jewellers who were doing job-work with the unit located in Mahidhapura. About 50 jewellers from Surat and Mumbai were identified and they were served with notices over the tax evasion. 
 
 “There is a uniform rate of 3% on the jewellery sector. The firm in question was manufacturing high-end diamond jewellery for the jewellers in Surat and Mumbai and that they had not taken registration under the GST. The finished articles were given away without bills and invoice and the GST registration number, thereby evading tax,” a GST officer said. 
 
 He added, “We have served notices to the jewellers in Surat and Mumbai to remain present before the office with required documents.”
