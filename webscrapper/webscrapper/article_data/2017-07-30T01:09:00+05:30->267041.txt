Salem/Erode: Dharmapuri MP and Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) leader Dr   Ramadoss’ save Cauvery campaign entered the second day on Saturday and he received rousing welcome as he travelled all the way from Erode to Trichy.

 The three-day campaign was launched on Friday. It started at Biligundulu, the entry point of Cauvery in Tamil Nadu border, and ended at Bhavani in Erode district on the first day.
 
 Addressing the public in Bhavani and Erode city, Anbumani stressed on the importance of forming Cauvery Management Board. “Pattali Makkal Katchi is inviting all the people in the state to save Cauvery,” he said and made it clear that the campaign was not intended to target central or state government.
 
 The PMK leader also explained the need to stop the construction of Mekedatu dam, a Rs 5,900 crore project by Karnataka government, across Cauvery near Hogenakkal in Dharmapuri district. “The entire Tamil Nadu would go barren if the Karnataka government were to construct the dam at Mekedatu,” he said.
 
 Anbumani also urged the state government to construct check dams across Cauvery starting from Hogenakkal. About 900tmc surplus water flows to Bay of Bengal every year, especially during rain, he said. “Actually, we depend on Karnataka for only 192tmc water. The issue can be easily tackled if the state government were to construct dams across Cauvery,” the Dharmapuri MP added.
 
 Pointing out that Karnataka government was letting off 15 lakh litre of sewage water and industrial waste into Cauvery, the PMK leader asked the state government to warn the neighbouring state against the practice.
 
 Anbumani also appealed the central government to announce Cauvery Delta region as an agricultural zone, while slamming the state government for not taking any step to curb illegal sand mining in Cauvery.
 
 The PMK leader participated in a bike rally organised as part of the campaign in Salem and Erode districts.
