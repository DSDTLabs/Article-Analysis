JAIPUR: Underaged drivers have become a new cause of concern for the city’s traffic police. In order to impress friends, the minors are risking their lives by driving two-wheelers and four-wheelers without licence, cops said.

 According to cops, the problem aggravates during examination time when several students throng examination centres driving their cars and bikes.
 
 “Sometimes, there are three to four people on one bike, and in order to reach the   at the right time these students don’t mind driving at high speed, which often touches the dangerous mark of 80 km/h,” a senior police official said, adding that despite several attempts to rein in underage drivers, the problem persists, thanks to unconcerned parents. 
 
 “I once spoke to the parents of three underaged drivers during a special drive. The parents said their children have to attend multiple coaching classes after school hence they brought their kids new bikes,” the official said.
 
 As per   ( ), drivers below the age of 18 years are not allowed to drive. However, schools and parents never check the practice.
 
 “We have spoken to several schools in the city. They haven’t taken any strict decision to prohibit underage driving, in fact, many of them allow students to park their cars and bikes in school premises, which is violation of their own rules,” the police official said.
 
 A newly opened command centre at Jaipur police headquarters has been equipped to deal with the problem, he added.
 
 “We have decided that special searches will be conducted once the exams are over to catch the offenders. Their vehicles will also be seized and action will be taken as per the MV act,” the official said.
