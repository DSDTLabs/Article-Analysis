Margao: Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral has organized a visit to the state-of-the-art waste management plant at Saligao for the people of his constituency on April 17. The move assumes significance as the second waste management facility, on the lines of the Saligao plant, is proposed to be set up in Cacora in Curchorem constituency. 

 Addressing reporters, alongwith Curchorem-Cacora municipal council chairperson Sushant Naik and councilors, Cabral urged people not to protest the project “just for the sake of opposition”. “As per my assurance, I have now organized this visit, and I invite all my voters, well-wishers and opponents, to participate in the visit, so as to decide on the future course of the plant,” Cabral said. Cabral has expressed his desire to make Curchorem the cleanest municipality in India.
 
 “The garbage treatment plant is of latest technology and the first of its kind in Asia, and is foolproof as far as environmental pollution is concerned. This plant, besides being environment-friendly, can also generate employment to the local youth and will also generate electricity as a by-product which will be utilized for running the plant and any access will be put back in the government power grid,” Cabral said in the pamphlet he had distributed before the elections. Stating that spillage of garbage during transportation was unfounded, Cabral said that the waste will be transported in air-tight vehicles.
