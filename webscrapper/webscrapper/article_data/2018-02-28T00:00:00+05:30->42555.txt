 is one of the few belly dancers in the country who has been pursuing the form just for the love of it for over a decade. “I come from an orthodox family, where the priority was to finish my education. I am a software engineer and even worked as one for a while. But the job left me with a feeling of emptiness. That’s when I decided to pursue dancing instead,” says Bindu.
Her tryst with dancing, says Bindu, began in 2007. “After learning classical belly dancing in Bengaluru, I took a loan to go to the   in San Francisco and learn tribal fusion belly dancing, which is a sub-genre of classical belly dancing. I wanted to learn the art from where it originated and have since been pursuing this genre mainly,” says Bindu, who recently performed at the fbb   South 2018 in Bengaluru.
  adds that there has been a change, albeit minor, in the way the art has been perceived. “There is a difference in the way it has been accepted and perceived from the time I started pursuing the art. It will, however, take a few more years to gain full acceptance. People looked at it as a form for just male entertainment, but now it’s slowly being accepted as an art form,” she explains. 
 Bindu also says that belly dancing in cinema has both positives and negatives. “The fact that they have belly dancing is a good promotion of the form. On the flip side, the art is diluted, as it has to be commercialized. While people can figure out when   has been tweaked and is in its semi-classical style, they aren’t mostly aware if the belly dancing genre is being adapted the same way and believe what is shown there is the form,” she adds, saying that she wouldn’t mind choreographing for films if she were given a chance to showcase the form in its essence.
