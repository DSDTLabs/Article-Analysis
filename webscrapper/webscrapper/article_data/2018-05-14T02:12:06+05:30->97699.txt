GHAZIABAD: A 37-year-old man was arrested on Sunday for murdering an elderly woman in Kalkagarhi on May 10. The accused, Amit Kumar, allegedly killed Sharda Devi (70) because she opposed his relationship with her widowed daughter-in-law.

 The woman’s husband   had died two years ago due to excessive drinking. She had reportedly come in contact with Amit, a   of readymade garments, nearly an year back.
 
 According to police, the woman used to visit the Kalkagarhi house every day to meet her mother-in-law. Amit used to meet her at the Kalkagarhi house during her daily visits.
 
 “Sharda Devi had many a time caught the duo together. She was opposed to Amit’s proposal to marry her daughter-in-law. On May 10, Amit had bludgeoned the old woman to death with bricks after finding her alone at home. He had consumed alcohol before killing the woman,” said SSP Vaibhav Krishna.
