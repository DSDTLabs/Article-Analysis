Mumbai: The BMC’s plan for a   at   inched a step closer to reality with the   (MHCC) giving its nod on February 9. 

 It was in 2009 that   took over India United Mills No. 2 and 3 for the museum. The property is almost in ruins now. The idea, according to civic officials, was to bring to life the city’s mill culture through a museum. BMC officials said the project will be implemented in two phases. The tenders for the first phase are almost in the final stages and would be sent to the standing committee for approval. For the first phase, BMC would be spending around Rs 6 crore.
 
 The MHCC approval for the first phase was granted in November. 
 
 The committee suggested the consultants to consider two aspects: to retain a part of a wall with heavy vegetation growth to show the state of the mill and appreciate the efforts taken to restore the premises. Another was to retain and restore the entrance gate/muster chowki on the east side. An official said, "The muster chowki or the punching machine where the mill workers marked their attendance still exists and the committee felt it would be interesting for visitors to see it if it could be restored." Sir JJ College of architecture is the consultant for the project.
 
 The phase one covers cleaning and beautification of the lake and an open air landscaped area in the compound. Besides, there are also plans for a light and sound show at the water body. 
 
 In the second phase, the consultant the the committee that as most of the buildings elements—cast iron columns, door& window frames, staircases, floors, roofs—are in a deteriorated condition they need to be replaced with new ones matching the original.
