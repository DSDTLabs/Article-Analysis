Known for backing path-breaking and unconventional cinema like Dev.D, A Wednesday, Rang De Basanti and Barfi! in their first innings together at UTV,   and   have collaborated for the first time in their new avatars — RSVP and Roy Kapur Films — for Pihu. The film is directed by journalist-turned-filmmaker   Kapri and the story revolves around a two-year-old girl Pihu, who is left alone in an apartment. What ensues makes for an edge-of-the-seat social thriller, which is based on a true story.

 Much like they’ve done in the past with films like The Lunchbox, Shahid, Khosla Ka Ghosla and Udaan, Ronnie and   have identified Pihu, too, as a film that has the potential to break the norms of storytelling. The film was officially selected for prestigious international film festivals, which include Vancouver, Palm Springs,  , Morocco and Germany. Pihu, in fact, won the ‘Best Film’ at Morocco. It was also the opening movie at the International Film Festival of India, Goa (2017), where it received positive reviews.
 
 Vinod Kapri shares, “I am still pinching myself that I could complete Pihu. It was almost an impossible film. In the beginning, my friend, the late Kirshan Kumar, trusted my dream and the film was born. Later, the way Siddharth and Ronnie adopted it is no less than a fairy tale for me, as they understand cinema in its true sense.”
 
 Siddharth says, “It’s always thrilling to come across directors who want to tell stories that disrupt the status quo using bold new narrative styles. It is a towering directorial achievement by Vinod and we look forward to bringing it to audiences soon.” Ronnie adds, “Pihu is a unique film and thrillingly real. Imagine 90 minutes of a spellbinding experience. It tugs at your heart at all times.” Both Ronnie and Siddharth believe in presenting content-driven films and delivering movies backed by power-packed performances by talented actors and directors.
 
 Pihu releases on August 3.
