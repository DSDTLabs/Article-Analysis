 The district police, which registered a case in the early hours of July 13, arrested Nayak and released him soon after on personal bail and announced that the case would be probed by a   rank officer .
 
 The association members submitted a copy of the resolutions, passed at its emergency general body meeting, to Singh. "Since the incident involves the offence of outraging the modesty of women, no less than the district collector, the investigation of the offence must be entrusted to a senior lady IPS officer not below the rank of IG," it said.
 
 Responding to queries by mediapersons later, Acharya said, "A crime is a crime and the law will take its course." He also said that the chief secretary had heard them patiently and responded to their request positively. The Association also resolved to provide all necessary legal assistance to the Mahbubabad district collector.
