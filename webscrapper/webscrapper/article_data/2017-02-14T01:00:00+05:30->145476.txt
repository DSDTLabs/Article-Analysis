  The Virgin Tree puja at Hindu College on a previous Valentine’s Day
 
 “Damdami Mai ki puja never happened while we were in college. I think it started happening because the interaction between juniors and seniors stopped, and for us, that was the way to meet new people. It was a hangout spot for couples and those singles who hoped that they might find ‘the one’, which actually used to happen. When I was in my first year, I was ragged near the Virgin Tree. My senior, who was ragging me, she turned out to be ‘the one’ and became my valentine within six months. During my ragging, I was asked to marry her, agni ke phere leke. Par aag thi nahi, toh maine machis ki tilli se aag jalake shaadi ki thi. I think in our times, Virgin Tree was the last stop for virgins. I mean, humaare time mein itni rok nahi thi, 90% students relationship mein thay. Tabhi humein zaroorat nahi padti thi puja karne ki.”
