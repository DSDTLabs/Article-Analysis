Ludhiana: An elderly couple allegedly harassed by their son and daughter-in-law, attempted suicide by consuming a poisonous substance and hanging themselves with the ceiling at their house in Sector 32 of Chandigarh Road on Monday. However the neighbours came to their rescue and rushed them to a private hospital on Brown Road where their condition is stated to be critical. The police have also recovered two suicide notes posted on the window of the house in which they have accused their younger son and his wife for harassing them and forcing to take this extreme step. 

 The two have been identified as Gurmeet Singh, 65, owner of a building construction material store and his wife Avinash Kaur, 62. Kulwinder Singh, their elder son said they are two brothers and both are married. Initially they were living in a joint family with their parents in Khud Mohalla. However following a dispute, he shifted to the MIG flats on Chandigarh Road with his wife and children. 
 
 He also alleged that his younger brother and his wife used to harass his parents after which the latter shifted to Sector 32, Chandigarh Road sometime back. He added that while his parents were shifting, his sister-in-law did not allow them to take the furniture and other stuff along. Though his parents approached the cops, his brother and sister-in-law continued to harass them. 
 
 “My parents used to go for morning walks every day and would spend a lot of time with neighbours. On Monday, when they did not come out from the house, their neighbours came to my home which is nearby. After persistent knocking, when nobody opened the door, we broke open the door and found them hanging,” he said.
 
 The couple was rushed to hospital and Division no 7 police were informed. The SHO at police station Division no 7, inspector Parveen Randev said police are awaiting the couple to gain consciousness so that their statement could be recorded.
