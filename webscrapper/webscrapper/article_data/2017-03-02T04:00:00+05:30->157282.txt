Vadodara: The Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) on Wednesday sent a letter to the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (COA) regarding implementation of Lodha Committee’s recommendations. 

 The BCA management told the COA that it was overstepping its brief given by the SC. ‘We are alarmed at the attempt to go beyond the order of the Supreme Court by improving on the disqualifications and also upon the categories of persons who are liable to be disqualified,’ the letter states. BCA claimed that even the SC order doesn’t envisage any disqualifications of any other person’s associated with the state associations, save and except the office bearers of the association. 
 
 The letter further says that there is no order of the court in effect that makes persons who have been office bearers of BCCI for a total period of nine years to be disqualified as office bearers in the state cricket associations. 
 
 ‘In fact, the court has made it abundantly clear on January 20, 2017 that period of nine years as officebearer in BCCI would count only towards the BCCI and the period in state associations would count only towards the state associations,’ the letter reads. ‘At this stage, we wish to inform you that we have been advised that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the associations which seek to recall the previous orders including the principal judgement dated July 18, 2016. The next date of hearing is on March 27, 2017 and we have been advised that the court is likely to take up the issue on that day,’ the letter further said. The BCA has told COA that it will await further orders in this matters from the SC. 
 
 “We sent the letter on the basis of the decision taken during the BCA managing committee on Tuesday. The step is in interest of ensuring quality cricket development in BCA,” said BCA treasurer, Amul Jikar. The BCA, however, is now uncertain over filing contempt of court against the COA.
