DEHRADUN: The new BJP government will present its first budget in the 12-day assembly session that starts from June 8. Due to shortage of time to prepare the budget, the   government had opted for vote-on-account in March.
 
  Earlier, there were talks of holding the session at Gairsain in Chamoli district but the state government has decided to hold the session in Dehradun. CM Trivendra Singh Rawat told reporters that the government does not want to disturb the ongoing Char Dham yatra so the session will be held in the state capital.   lies in Chamoli district.
  
  According to the notification issued by secretary, Uttarakhand assembly,  , finance minister   will table the budget for 2017-18 in the assembly on June 8. Discussion on the budget will continue from June 9 to 12. On June 13, the budget will be presented department wise. The voting for the budget will be held on June 15.
  
  The Congress was quick to point out that the BJP was not holding the session at Gairsain and had taken no initiative to develop the town.
  
  Congress spokesperson   told TOI, “During its tenure from 2007 to 2012, the BJP government did not take any initiative to develop Gairsain and this time too they will do the same.” He said that by constructing the assembly building and residential quarters for MLAs and officers in Gairsain, the Congress government had laid the foundation stone for the process.
  
  “We even started holding assembly sessions at Gairsain. The BJP government needs to work on the base which we had provided to them. It needs to fulfill its commitment to the people,” added the senior Congress leader.
