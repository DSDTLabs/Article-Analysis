AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday sent an eight months pregnant teen to a women’s shelter home in   and ordered that nobody be allowed to meet her against her will.

 The court ordered that the 16-year-old be kept at the  , after she flatly told the court that she was ready to go to the prison, but not to her father’s house. Her father was seeking custody after filing a habeas corpus petition alleging that she was illegally confined by her friend.
 
 When the court inquired, the girl said she was tortured at her   and has moved to her maternal home. But she was   too and she called her friend and asked him to take her along. As the girl was pregnant, the HC ordered the authorities to take proper care of her and her child.
