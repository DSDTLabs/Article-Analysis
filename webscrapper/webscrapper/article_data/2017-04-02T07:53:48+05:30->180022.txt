BELAGAVI: Demanding a share of water from  , 11 villages from three gram panchayats have decided to file a public interest litigation. The villages will approach the court under the banner of   (BNS), headed by noted social worker  . A decision to this effect was taken a recent meeting of leaders of the 11 villages which fall under  ,   and Rakaskop gram panchayats.

 According to advocate Namdev More, a member of BNS, people of the 11 villages had given their land for the construction of reservoir, one of major sources of water to Belagavi city. “After construction of the reservoir, the government completely neglected its promises due to which villages surrounding the reservoir are reeling under water crisis. People of these villages are not allowed to use the reservoir water for any purpose. This is nothing but harsh injustice,” he said.
 
 The government has not taken up any other project for a permanent solution to drinking water problems, said More. “Yarebail village, located just 1km from the reservoir is completely depending on tanker water today. Residents of Bijagarni get tap water once in eight days. Kavalewadi village, located just 3km from the reservoir, has lost all its sources of water. The small streams joining the reservoir were earlier used for farming. Ironically, no public representatives has raised the issue to provide justice to nearly 30,000 people,” said More.
 
 “It’s a big injustice to keep these people thirsty,” said Kaganikar.
