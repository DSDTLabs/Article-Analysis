Gurgaon: Transmission company Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Ltd (HVPNL) is installing gas insulated system (GIS)-operated   across Gurgaon. At present, only two such sub-stations — one in Sector 43 and another in Sector 51 — are operational in the city.

 According to HVPNL’s superintending engineer Anil Yadav, three more sub-stations are being set up in sectors 20, 57 and 33. “The company has decided to install   power houses across the new sectors, 58-115. However, we won’t touch the regular sub-stations which are already there,” he told TOI. 
 
 The GIS system has an advantage over the standard sub-stations as the former occupies less space and is low-maintenance, reducing the possibility of power cuts because of lack of upkeep. 
 
 “When we formulated the Gurgaon Action Plan in 2014, we had decided to build 66 kV sub-stations. Later we realised that considering the demand, the sub-stations needed to be 220 kV. But, Huda had allotted us the land adequate only for 66 kV substations. Decision to go with 220 kV threw a spanner since the land wasn’t sufficient,” an HVPNL official said.
 
 Apparently, a 220kV GIS substation occupies only 1,500 sqm of space, while the standard substation occupies up to 4,000 sq m of land. In the ideal GIS system, the conductors through which the electricity passes are surrounded by a field of gas instead of being sheathed by heavy insulators that occupy plenty of space.
