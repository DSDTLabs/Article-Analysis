PATNA: The six-day group  , christened ‘Kala Mangal’, began at Bihar Lalit Kala Academy (BLKA) here on Tuesday. 

 Altogether 12 artists are displaying their creations – 11 paintings and 15 sculptures – in the exhibition jointly organised by the BLKA and state art, culture and youth department.
 
 “Art exhibitions such as this provide an opportunity to budding artists to learn and interact with the audience,” said BLKA chief  , adding that it took more than a month for the artists to complete their artworks for the exhibition.
 
 Saran’s Neha Noopur and her younger sister Ankita Noopur have together displayed 14 artworks. “We have not received any formal training in arts as we studied science till our graduation. I incorporate chess as an element to display my art through painting. In one of my paintings, I placed Lord Buddha on a chess board,” said Ankita.
 
 Ramakant, an aspiring artist from College of Arts and Crafts, Patna, has displayed a sculpture urging people to give up smoking.
 
 Pitching for a drug-free society, artist Ripu Ranjan Kumar has made a sculpture showing a person stopping another from consuming drug. “Art is an effective medium to create awareness on social issues,” said Kumar.
 
 Satyawati Kumari, a freelance artist, has displayed her eight artworks in the exhibition. “Schoolchildren should be encouraged to visit art galleries. Art is a holistic medium to develop young minds,” said Satyawati. “The best artworks should be displayed in galleries across the country. Efforts should be made by the government to showcase the artworks of Bihar artists in national and international galleries,” she added.
 
 Ramakant, the convenor of the exhibition, has displayed a wooden sculpture on anti-smoking.
 
 Mamta Bharati, who won the state award in 2012 for her Madhubani paintings, said, “Art brings joy to the artists and the audience should take up art as a medium of expression.”
