KOTTAYAM:   (M) has moved closer to the   as the party chairman   ruled out the chances of the party returning to the UDF fold. Mani who opened his mind to the media after inviting a section of them to his residence in Pala on Saturday, also slammed the CPI and its state secretary   who are the stumbling block for the KC (M) for entering into the LDF.

 Mani met the media mainly to respond to the invitation extended by the Congress Leader Oommen Chandy to the KC (M) for returning to the UDF and also for reacting to the remarks made by Kanam Rajendran.
 
 Chandy had said it was the wish of the Congress party that Mani should return to the UDF fold. Mani thanked the goodwill of Chandy and said that his party will not return to the UDF. He also said that the party has not yet discussed the topic of joining a political front. "We have no thirst or wish for joining a Political Front. We will join those parties who go along with the stand of our party,” he said.
 
 Mani also slammed Kanam for his statements made the other day. Apparently referring to the CPM’s reported bid to get the Kerala Congress (M) into the LDF camp, Kanam had said that the LDF need not be a 'ventilator' to those who are in their deathbed. The CPI secretary had also reiterated the opposition to the KC (M)'s entry into the LDF.
 
 Reacting to this Mani said "CPI is a grave party". The CPI can’t even win one seat singlehandedly, he said. He also said that Kanam is crossing the limits with his statements. He also asked Kanam not to fritter the respectability of the CPI which was led by many great persons.
 
 The recently held district meets of the CPM had taken a favourable stand for the entry of the KC (M) to the LDF. However, the CPI has taken a strong position against the move, thereby picking up a rivalry with the CPM. The Kottayam district meet of the CPI to be held from February 13-16 at Karukachal, the home turf of Kanam, has gained significance in the changing political scenario.
