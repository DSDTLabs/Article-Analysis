Coimbatore: The rural police on Sunday registered a case under Section 176 (i) (inquiry by magistrate into the cause of death -when any person died while in the custody of the police) of the CrPC after a 21-year-old man, who was undergoing treatment at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (Cmch) for injuries he received when a group of people thrashed him, passed away at the hospital on Saturday.

 The victim was identified as M Sahul Hameed of SM Nagar at Kattoor in Mettupalayam. “On the evening of January 22, Sahul Hameed and M Syed Ibrahim of Mettupalayam had snatched the handbag of Rama, wife of Sugumaran on Sirumugai Road in Mettupalayam, while she was travelling along with her husband on a motorcycle. When the duo attempted to escape from the place, the motorcycle they were travelling on skidded and they fell on the road. They suffered head injuries. Also, local residents, who rushed to the place, allegedly roughed them up, before handing them over to Mettupalayam police,” a police officer said.
 
 While police arrested Syed Ibrahim and remanded him in judicial custody, Sahul Hameed was admitted in Cmch for treatment. Sahul Hameed died without responding to the treatment at the hospital on Saturday evening. Refusing to accept the body, his relatives demanded that a case should be registered for illegal police custody. Based on their demands, Mettupalayam police registered a case under Section 176 (i) of the CrPC. Mettupalayam judicial magistrate also conducted an inquiry in connection with the case.
 
 The relatives also demanded action against those who caused the death. They received the body only after police held a talk with them and promised to take suitable action.
 
 Meanwhile, sources said that police had not registered a case against Sahul Hameed and did not inform the judiciary officials about his condition. They also failed to submit the medical report to the judicial officials.
