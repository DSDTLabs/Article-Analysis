Dry conditions have made a comeback in the state, along with   wave conditions in Vidarbha. Chances of pre-monsoon showers have dwindled even more, with little possibility of rain in Konkan, Marathwada, Madhya Maharashtra and Vidarbha till May 21. 

 The pre-monsoon rain deficiency stands at 49% across the state. All Met department stations in the state continue to show   pre-monsoon rains, except in Solapur. While Mumbai has received no rainfall worth recording this season, Pune has received only 6.5 mm rain during the recent spell, as against a normal of 30.7mm.
 
 Pre-monsoon rainfall deficiency in Madhya Maharashtra currently stands at 38%, and that in Vidarbha and Marathwada at 66%. The showers are an important phenomenon between March and May, which is also called the pre-monsoon season. The rainfall not only lowers summer temperatures but also helps farmers prepare land for the upcoming kharif season.
 
 Heatwave conditions have returned to Vidarbha, where the day temperature on Tuesday was an unusual 46.8 degrees Celsius. On Wednesday, the temperature stood at 45.4 degrees Celsius.
 
 “The prevailing anti-cyclone conditions over the Arabian Sea and the high-pressure belt, extending from the Arabian Sea to Central India, has been suppressing rainfall over western parts and Maharashtra, apart from causing heatwave conditions over Vidarbha, among other regions in the country,” said an   official.
 
 Officials said anti-cyclonic circulation, prevailing over the region from March, was responsible for the suppressed rainfall activity in the pre-monsoon season.
