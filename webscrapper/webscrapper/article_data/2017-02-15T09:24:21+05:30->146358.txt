AHMEDABAD: Childhood sweethearts   and   tied the knot on Valentine’s Day. For them, love started as a platonic relationship and nothing beyond.   Tiya (earlier Ravi) underwent gender reassignment surgery last year. While they married in a closed religious ceremony last August, they decided to mark Valentine’s Day as their official wedding date. The two submitted their marriage registration papers through a   on Tuesday.

 “What could be a better way to make it special. We got married six months after my surgery. My soul is that of a woman and this is how I wanted to be. Paying Rs 5 lakh wasn’t easy but I managed to do it because we both wanted to start a life together. I am grateful for the way Premkumar respected me and stood by me all the way,” said Tiya, who went under the knife in February last year.
 
 “We have been good friends since childhood. Even if she is transgender, I was willing to spend my life with her. Two years ago, I asked her out and she agreed to my proposal. Our parents weren’t happy with our choices but we were sure that our love will stand the test of time,” said Premkumar, a textile artisan based in Naroda.
 
 When she was single, Tiya adopted her brother’s son, Harry, due to financial troubles in their family soon after he was born. Last month, she and Premkumar adopted a daughter, Rajvi, who is three years old. “We won’t be able to conceive biologically. We always wanted a child to complete our family and therefore, we now decided to adopt a daughter,” added Tiya.
