LUCKNOW: Fresh signs of discontent emerged from within the Congress on Friday after disciplinary committee chair Ram   issued a showcause notice to Sanjay Dixit, convenor of the Congress' flagship programmes. 

 After the Congress' poor performance in the UP polls- it was reduced to 7 MLAs in the UP assembly â€” Dixit took to Facebook earlier this week in critique of senior leaders   and Salman Khurshid continuing to support the alliance between Congress and SP. Referring to it as lazy politics in which the party was looking for shortcuts instead of building its own base and encouraging its cadre, Dixit has also pointed fingers at Congress state chief Raj Babbar, alleging that it was shameful that he was not consulted while entering into an alliance with the SP, nor in deciding tickets, or even in appointing people to the   Committee. Dixit also said party leaders Sonia, Rahul and   should meet workers at least twice every month for workers to be able to share their opinions. 
 
 Dwivedi, who said Dixit should have raised his concerns on the right platform, has sought an explanation from Dixit on why this should not be made ground for disciplinary action against him. Earlier, senior Congress leader and former MLC Naseeb Pathan was served a showcause notice for venting his opinons against senior partyman Ghulam Nabi Azad in public.
