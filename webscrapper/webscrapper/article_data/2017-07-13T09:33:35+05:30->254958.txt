KOLKATA: The screening of Suman Ghosh's ' ' at Nandan 3 on Monday was a violation of law. That's what the CEO of Central Board of Film Certification   insists. Though he refused to comment on the beep controversy regarding the   since he hadn't received the 'factual report' as yet, he was quick to point at the lapse in screening it before certification.
 
 Ghosh had earlier pointed out to TOI that since there was no tickets sold for the screening at Nandan 3, it should be considered a private show. "Earlier we were supposed to screen it at Quest. We changed the venue. We couldn't have this screening even at Nandan 1. But it's different for Nandan 3," the director argued.
  
 However, Srivastava said, "We don't allow this. It is a clear violation of law. Everybody is important in his own right. We can't allow any violation of law. A   doesn't mean it is a paid exhibition. Even if it unpaid, it is still public exhibition. I will talk to the chairperson about this," Srivastava said.
