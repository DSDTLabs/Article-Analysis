Rajkot: The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) will now penalize those who spit on the roads, especially those who spit chewing tobacco while driving a vehicle. 

 RMC has empowered its sanitary inspectors to penalize the offenders who are found spitting at public places. The civic body has also decided to upload pictures of violators on its social media pages.
 
 The civic body has decided to impose a fine of Rs 100 on those who spit tobacco or mava (tobacco mixed with betel nut shreds). “Fellow commuters feel harassed when somebody driving a two-wheeler or car spits on the road while driving. Nearly 100 sanitary inspectors in 18 wards have been empowered to collect fines,” said RMC environment engineer Nilesh Parmar. “This will deter citizens from spitting in public places.”
 
 Sanitary inspectors will take rounds of their respective wards during peak hours in the morning and evening. If somebody is caught spitting on CCTV cameras near RMC office they will be penalized immediately. 
 
 RMC commissioner Banchha Nidhi Pani said, “We will ask people to upload pictures of those spitting in public places on RMC’s Facebook page. This will expose the violators.”
