PUNE: Even as parts of northern and central India shivered this winter and El Nino was absent, 2017 turned out to be the fourth hottest year ever recorded in India. 

 India Meteorological Department (IMD) data revealed that September and October in 2017 were warmest ever in the last 117 years with an average temperature rise of 0.82 degrees C and 1.11 degrees C, respectively — the highest increase ever for the two months.
 
 India’s hottest years since 1901 have been recorded in the last decade. A K Srivastava, senior scientist and head of the climate monitoring and analysis group at IMD, Pune, told TOI that the rise in the average temperature was also witnessed in December 2017, making the winter month the fifth warmest since 1901. 
 
 The average temperature rose by 0.69 degrees C in December 2017. “The warmest years during the last 117 years have been 2016, followed by 2009, 2010, and now, 2017. La   conditions prevailed till March-April last year, which was followed by neutral conditions — neither La Nina nor El Nino,” Srivastava said.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 In 2016 too, he added, September and October had witnessed the highest rise in average temperature in comparison to Septembers and October in 1901. Though 2016 was the warmest year on record, September and October 2017 broke earlier temperature records by becoming the warmest September and October ever. 
 
 The  's   (C3S) had confirmed that 2016 was the warmest year on record, with global average temperature 0.2 degrees celsius higher than 2015. 
 
 C3S also found that 2016 was the first year CO2 levels did not return below 400 ppm as summer turned to autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. In the previous years, the take-up of CO2 by vegetation during the summer growing season has typically seen September mark the lowest point for CO2 levels. 
 
 El Nino is a term for abnormal warming of waters in the east and central equatorial   which leads to atmospheric changes that are known to adversely impact the crucial summer monsoon in India. It is believed to cause a rise in temperatures. As cold wave conditions hounded the ongoing winter, temperatures in peninsular India remained normal to above normal, which could have contributed to the warming trend in 2017.
 
 A few months ago, World Meteorological Organization had forecast that 2017 could be one of the top three hottest years on record. This was in confirmation with a renewed warming trend in recent years.
