CHENNAI: When a   recently complained on change.org saying she was groped while porters tried to lift and assist her into a coach at  , the petition did not just spark outrage on social media. It forced Southern Railway to act.

 Realising there were no wheel-chairs that could fit into the door of a coach, railways officials procured two foldable wheel-chairs and placed them at for the all-woman facilitation centre at Chennai Central. Chennai division has already placed orders for 20 more wheelchairs. Other divisions are set to follow.
 
 A senior official confirmed that the wheel-chairs were procured after the complaint by the passenger went viral on social media platforms. “When we spoke to other passengers, we realised this was a problem that could be easily resolved, but nobody had taken the initiative,” he said.
 
 “I’ve been groped and manhandled three separate times by porters. They were helping me board the train because Indian trains are not wheelchair accessible. Sign my petition and join me in asking the railway minister and the Prime Minister to implement disabled friendly measures in Indian railways” the complaint said. 
 
 The side wheel of a wheelchair at the exclusive centre for women at Chennai   can be folded, allowing the passenger to be lifted into the coach. The other can be taken right up to the seat. Currently, these wheelchairs will be available only for women, the official said. A special phone number will be introduced to help passengers send their requirement in advance, he added.
 
 “This will help avoid a porter or a help physically touching the woman passenger. We are also speaking to the mechanical department so that a special ramp can be made to wheel the chair into the coach,” he said.
 
 The zonal railways will also ensure that woman railway employees at the facilitation centre or a woman porter accompany the passenger up to the coach to prevent any untoward incident.
