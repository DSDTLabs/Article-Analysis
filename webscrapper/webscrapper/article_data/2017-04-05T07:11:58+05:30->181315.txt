HYDERABAD: As if the cash crunch in ATMs in the city was not enough to leave many Hyderabadis stranded, customers said they are being forced to bear with an unofficial cap on withdrawal from banks too. 

 Officials in public sector banks said that though the   was better on Monday, they were unable to dispense more than Rs 10,000 per person on Tuesday. “Whatever cash we have, the priority is clearing salaries and pension accounts,” said a chief manager of a bank.
 
 Though private banks were better off than the public sector ones, they too have put informal cap on withdrawals. From savings accounts, the maximum cash that can be withdrawn is Rs 25,000. Banks are dispensing Rs 50,000 to current account holders depending on the cash reserves. “But that is on first-cum-first-serve basis. Once cash reserves come down by afternoon, we are forced to cut down the cash withdrawals,” said another bank manager.
 
 “In my area, all the ATMS displayed no cash boards. There was no respite even after going to the bank. I wanted Rs 30,000, but they gave me only Rs 6,000. There has to be quick remedy for this crisis,” said M Vasudha, a resident of Masab Tank.
 
 Even though most people have shifted to digital transactions, the cash requirement is still felt by small vendors and maids who don’t accept online payments. “I switched to cashless transactions but my cash requirement is still Rs 10,000 per month. I can’t do away with cash and this crunch has to end soon,” said  , a private employee.
