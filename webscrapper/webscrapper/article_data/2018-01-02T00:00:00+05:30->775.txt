With a burst of confetti and fireworks, hordes of revellers, cutting across beliefs and faith, ushered in 2018 at the stroke of midnight all over the city. 

 On New Year’s Eve, the city was packed with numerous parties and events organised by hotels, pubs and restaurants at various locations. As anticipated, the entertainment hubs were bustling with crowds soon after the sunset. And the fact that New Year Eve fell on Sunday led to an influx of revellers. In a build-up to the big bash, the organisers arranged special activities to mark the New Year with great pomp and show. The DJs and live bands set the mood of the evening with foot tapping numbers. 
 
 Partygoers in large numbers turned up — phones in hand — and captured the moments as they danced, sang and hugged each other. When the clock struck 12, hundreds of revellers cut loose and hit the streets in high spirits, bidding farewell to the year that had just ended, eager to move on to a new chapter in the book of life.
