BHOPAL: The tough times aren’t over for senior   of Madhya Pradesh cadre, Deepali Rastogi, who raised some uncomfortable questions about the Centre’s open-defecation-free campaign in an article in an English daily.

 Rastogi, who is posted as commissioner, MP tribal welfare department, was served a notice on Tuesday. But the government isn’t done with it.   of state for general administration department, Lal Singh Arya, told TOI on Wednesday that what she wrote “was not correct” and cautioned officers to “follow the code of conduct”. “Don’t people attend to nature’s call in toilets in dry areas now? She has written about water scarcity, but why are people supporting the Centre’s   campaign throughout the country then?” the minister asked, adding that a notice has been served and “further action will be decided after receiving her reply”.
 
 Rastogi, a 1994-batch officer, did not respond to TOI’s calls for her reaction. The opposition Congress has criticised the government for serving a notice on the bureaucrat, saying that the government should answer the questions she raised, rather than suppressing her voice.
 
 In her article, Rastogi wrote that the ODF campaign was an attempt to change centuries-old mindset in just a few months and raised doubts about the availability of water to clean toilets built under the ODF campaign. after picking holes in the way the scheme was touted by the government, she concluded by saying, “Don't get me wrong, I’m all for toilets. After all, I am a city-dweller. I'm just uncomfortable with the way we are pushing it.”
 
 Earlier, senior BJP MP Prahlad Patel had told reporters in Bhopal that some of the questions raised by Rastogi are “practical” and the government needs to address this problem.
