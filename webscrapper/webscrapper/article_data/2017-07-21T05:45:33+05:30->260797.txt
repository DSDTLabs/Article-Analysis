MUMBAI: Former SRA CEO   whose actions are now under scrutiny had decided on 137 files in the last month of his tenure. Five projects were given a final clearance or   ( ), according to a status report from the state housing department.

 TOI has details of the list of projects which were issued LOIs between April 1 and June 30, the day Patil retired.
 
 But it is only Patil's decisions in June which are being scrutinized by a fourmember committee which will examine if the 137 decisions were irregular. If there were irregularities, it will examine at which stage they occurred. A report is expected by the end of the month.
 
 Of the five projects issued a final clearance or LOI, two were given on Patil's last two days of service, the department found. On June 30 ­ the day he retired ­ Patil awarded LOI to an SRA scheme by Heer Mehata Landmark Developers. One June 29, an LOI was given to an SRA project in Santacruz to KT Developers. On June 22, he issued an LOI for a scheme in Andheri (E). On June 8 he awarded final clearance to a project in Chandivali in Kurla (W) to Kaushal Mukesh Builders. On June 9, he gave an LOI to an SRA scheme in Ghatkopar (E) by Arihant Infrastucture.
 
 Four projects were issued final clearance in May. On May 22 the largest project in the 3-month span was cleared: Reliable Builders' scheme in Govandi (E). The same month, LOIs were issued to projects in Sion, Vikhroli and Malvani. In April, three projects were given LOIs including one in Bandra (W).
 
 Among the 137 files, the one which generated most controversy was clearance to an irregular SRA proposal at MP Mill compound at Tardeo, reported by TOI on June 12. Housing minister Prakash Mehta sanctioned the proposal on June 21 and Patil cleared on June 23. But LOI was yet to be issued. CM Devendra Fadnavis stayed the proposal.
