MARGAO:   on Sunday approved an annual budget of approximately Rs 83 lakh.   sarpanch Eni Joanette Xavier   told TOI that an annual budget of Rs 83.4 lakh along with the audit report was approved by the gram sabha members.

 The main issue discussed during the gram sabha was that of garbage collection wherein it has been proposed to commence door-to-door collection of dry waste initially three-times-a-week instead of every day.
 
 “An announcement will be made in this regard at the Sunday masses as we are looking for someone to collect the waste or we will hire, with their wages fixed at Rs 500,” said Oliveira. The panchayat has been provided an annual amount of Rs 5 lakh for the purpose of waste management, including Rs 2 lakh for collecting plastic waste as there are plenty of plastic bottles lying strewn around the bandh.
