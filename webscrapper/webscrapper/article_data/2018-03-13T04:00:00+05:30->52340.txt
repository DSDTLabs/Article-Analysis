Chennai: Close to 10 lakh Aircel customers in Tamil Nadu have ported their numbers to Vodafone since the former’s networks faced severe downtime last month, Vodafone said. 

 Amid talks of Aircel’s financial stress last month, the company's networks were down leading to thousands of customers rushing to port their numbers to other service providers like Vodafone and Airtel. 
 
 “We have augmented capacity and added bandwidth to support the increasing demand from our own customers as well as new ones. Our retail stores have been open all 7 days for the last few weeks,” said S Murali, business head, Tamil Nadu, Vodafone.
 
 Vodafone has 23% revenue market share and 27% subscriber market share, company representatives said. 
 
 The company is also providing high speed fixed broadband services for homes and offices, through its 100% subsidiary YOU Broadband India Ltd. These services are being provided across select cities in Tamil Nadu and will be extended to further areas, Murali said.
