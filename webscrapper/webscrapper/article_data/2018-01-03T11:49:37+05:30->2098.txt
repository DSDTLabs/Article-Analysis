 The study-‘diet and nutritional status of urban population in India and prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia in urban men and women’ was conducted over a period of two years spanning between 2015 and 2016. A total of one lakh men were studied across 17 states.
 
 Speaking about the study, Dr A Lakshmaiah, lead scientist and principal investigator for the study said, “There is clear correlation between hypertension and alcohol as well as tobacco consumption. Prevalence of hypertension is highest by at least 10 per cent among people who exhibit these risk behaviours. Moreover, other cardiovascular diseases come into play along with hypertension, which is the key to cardiovascular problems. Hypertension adds to the risk of heart attack and stroke.”
 
 The sample size in the twin states for the risk behaviours was nearly 10,000 and comprised those above 18 years of age.
