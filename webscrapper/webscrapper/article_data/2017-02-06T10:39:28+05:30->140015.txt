HYDERABAD: The accident prone   in Chittoor district, which falls under the Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) and   (CBIC), has claimed 51 lives in the past one month, while another 103 people suffered injuries in various accidents during the same period.

 On Thursday, four Hyderabad pilgrims, who were on their way to Tirumala, died in an accident on the killer stretch. On Bhogi last month, seven people died in an accident, while 25 others suffered injuries. The following Kanuma festival also turned deadly as seven more people perished on the stretch. The Kummarmadugu stretch has become very busy as many people travel not only to take darshan of   in Tirumala but to visit several many other prominent temples located nearby .
 
 According to officials, some dangerous turns in these areas have become virtual death traps. However, officials have not initiated any action to prevent accidents on the stretch. “The situation is very dangerous near Mogili ghat and Palamaner area of CBIC as there is a hairpin turn here, this extends up to 10 km where the passengers have to literally hold their breath“  , a re sident of Srikalahasti said.
 
 However, officials attribute negligence, wrong parking and drunk driving as major reasons for accidents. “There are several eateries along the stretch and passengers park their vehicles on road leaving little space for passenger vehicles“, said a top official.
 
 Road safety experts say a few immediate measures can save many lives. “Drivers travelling long distances should have some parking spaces to rest for some time in the area“,  , an expert pointed out. Arranging danger sign-boards near bridges and sensitive areas is one of the important measure suggested.
