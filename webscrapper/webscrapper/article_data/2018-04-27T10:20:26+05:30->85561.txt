SHIMLA: Senior BJP leader and Kangra MP   has sought from the state government and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to again verify the investigation conducted in Kotkhai rape and murder case. He said people had already lost faith in police and if the   investigation too would fail to win the trust of the masses then where would the people go o seek justice.

 Shanta Kumar, who has been chief minister of Himachal Pradesh twice, said in the Kotkhai case the CBI had termed a ‘charani’ (wood cutter) the accused. “If he is the real accused, then CBI should be commended for cracking the case. But if the real accused has escaped, then it would be a shameful and unfortunate incident,” he added.
 
 The BJP MP said in this case senior police officers had been arrested and they were still in jail. He expressed doubts whether these arrested police officials had destroyed evidence connected with the case due to which the real accused could not be arrested. 
 
 Vikas Thapta of Madad Seva Trust, which has been taking up the Kotkhai issue on all platforms, is also not happy with the CBI probe. He said there were many unanswered questions that had not been answered so far by the investigating agency. He added that the way the girl’s body was dumped in the forest area was not the handiwork of a single person. “Socks and some of the girl’s clothing has not been recovered till date,” Thapta said, adding that the CBI should make its investigation report public and tell people what was found in the forensic report. 
 
 Thapta said the CBI should also clear whether it was going to arrest more people or investigation would be concluded with the arrest of the wood cutter only.
