SALEM: Sugaveneswarar temple elephant, Rajeswari, which was ill for some days, lost one of its tusks when it fell from an earthmover that was used by Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) officials to lift it at the temple in Salem on Monday. 

 Even though Rajeswari is a female elephant, it had small tusks grown on either side of its mouth. 
 
 “Rajeswari has deformed left forelimb from birth. It was using its right forelimb for life which developed lameness for the past two weeks. Since then, the elephant was lying in the same place. It subsequently developed bedsores. In order to shift it to other side, we used an earthmover to lift it,” said a temple official.
 
 After the fall, the HR&CE officials have informed veterinary doctors from a city hospital. “Due to pain around the mouth area, the elephant was struggling to eat,” said a veterinary doctor.
 
 However, Salem-based activist, A Radhakrishnan, said the HR&CE officials lifted the jumbo without getting consent from the animal husbandry and the forest departments. “When they lifted it, the jumbo fell on its side. Due to the fall, its tusk got broken. It also sustained minor injuries,”   said.
 
 When contacted by TOI, principal secretary of the forest department, Nasimuddin, said steps would be taken to save the jumbo. “Dr Manoharan, who is an expert in handling elephants, would be sent to Salem to treat Rajeswari,” he said. 
 
 Two days ago, a team of specialists from   of the   and   (TANNUVAS) in   checked the elephant and took samples of blood and urine for further tests.
