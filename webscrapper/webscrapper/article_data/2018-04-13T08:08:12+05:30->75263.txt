BHOPAL/AGRA: A 200-metre long   built over river Chambal River linking Morena district of   with Pinhat in Uttar Pradesh was washed away due to high velocity wind and rain on Wednesday night.

 One end of this bridge was at Used Ghat under Mahua police station in Morena district. The incident took place around 9.30 pm. Four people who drowned during this incident were rescued by local residents and police.
 
 Meanwhile hundreds of people were left standard on both sides even as PWD engineers were trying to make an alternative arrangement by locating the pontoons.
 
 According to government officials, the pontoon bridge was found over 250 meters away from the river bank, where it was anchored and tied with ropes.
 
 G K Sharma, junior engineer of Public Works Department, Pinhat told TOI that the ropes used for connecting pontoons together snapped and the entire bridge disassembled. “We are now trying to bring back all pontoons together, so as to restart the traffic between two states,” he added.
 
 On an average over 20,000 commuters from both the states use pontoon bridge to travel across the river.
 
 Sub divisional magistrate of Bah, Arun Kumar said, “The PWD team will assemble the pontoon bridge by Friday afternoon.” For eight months, locals commute on handmade pontoon bridge, while for remaining four months they travel in steamer boats.
 
 Neeraj Parihar, local resident of Pinhat said, “Traveling in steamer boat is easy during monsoon season when the water level of the river is high, but between October to May, due to low water level, pontoon bridge is assembled by PWD so that residents of two states can travel across.
