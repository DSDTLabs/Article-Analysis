BENGALURU: City police on Thursday said they're on the money trail of a Delhi-based agency, which allegedly sold underage children to work as domestic helps in several Bengaluru households, to track down trafficked kids.

 The agency's role in child trafficking came to light during investigations into the suspected suicide of a live-in domestic help Phoolmani, who jumped to her death from the 9th floor flat of her techie-employer near   on April 2.
 
 The Assamese girl had been allegedly purchased from   by a retired army officer for Rs 1.2 lakh, which had been paid in four installments. Later, the officer sent the girl to his daughter's home in Bengaluru. Section 370 of the Indian Penal Code, pertaining to buying or disposing of human beings as slaves, was invoked in the case.
 
 Hemanth Nimbalkar, additional commissioner of po lice (east), confirmed that the agency's money trail is the prime evidence. He said police haven't tracked down the children, but they expect the money trail to lead them to at least some victims. “There were several deposits in the recruitment agency's bank account. We're in the process of identifying the nature of these transactions and who made them,“ he said.
 
 Police arresed three men ­ Layman Singh (director of Milan Enterprises),  , (in whose account the money was deposited) and   (a company agent). Police believe inputs from these interrogations will provide additional information.
 
 Police have managed to identify people who sold Phoolmani to the Delhi agency. Acting on information from Bengaluru police, Assam police registered a case and arrested   and Ganesh Hembram for selling her for Rs 19,000.This information is expected to provide details about the gang operating elsewhere.
