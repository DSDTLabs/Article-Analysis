NEW DELHI: The   on Monday released the   for   admission to   under the  . The admission system has been shifted online completely for all schools this session, except those private schools recognised by the local authority.

 According to the law, 25% seats have to be reserved for EWS/DG applicants and the admission must be done on the basis of proximity to the school. The guidelines state that preference will be given to students living in the first kilometre of the school, subsequently increasing the radius to 3km and 6km in case seats remain vacant.
 
 Though preference will be given on proximity, schools have been directed to accept forms from all applicants, irrespective of the distance, and then segregate them accordingly for draw of lots. The guidelines also state that the schools must ensure admission to entry-level classes of 25% EWS/DG students, calculated on the existing strength.
 
 A common registration form has been uploaded at www.edudel.nic.in for parents and schools. Schools have been directed to use only this form for the admission process and provide it free of cost. 
 
 They have also been directed to acknowledge the application through a proper receipt and a unique registration number. In case the application is rejected, the reason must be recorded and communicated to the parents. DoE will also provide observers for draw of lots during admissions.
 
 A list of schools and their vacancies has also been released along with the guidelines. However, questions are being raised about how honest the declaration of seats made by schools is. “The data on the website shows a huge concealment of seats in KG and Class I. The data does not seem to have been verified. The same mistake was made last year, which ultimately resulted in less number of   admissions in private schools,” said lawyer-activist Khagesh Jha.
