HYDERABAD: A   camera footage has unravelled how a man ended up being crushed by a truck on NH-65 on Tuesday night.The `accident case' turned out to be a case of scuffle where the man running away from his attackers came under the wheels of the truck. The police have now registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
On Tuesday night, V Rajesh (21), a catering worker, had gone to a pan shop near Word and   along the NH to buy a cigarette. But when he gave `100 to pan shop owner Nadeem for one cigarette costing `14, he sought change. Rajesh then gave a `10 note, but Nadeem demanded the balance `4 before giving the cigarette.
 
 â€œAn argument ensued between the two as Rajesh insisted that Nadeem give him the cigarette. Nadeem then called up his friends,'' Hayatnagar inspector Narender Goud said.
 
 Nadeem's four friends -Ghouse, Rehman, Salman, Rafi -joined him in beating Rajesh, who escaped from their clutches and ran to the other side of the road. But they chased and forcibly brought him back to the shop. Rajesh again managed to escape but this time came under a truck as he jumped the median to cross the road.
 
 All the culprits have been taken into police custody and the accident case was altered and registered under IPC Sec 304 II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).
