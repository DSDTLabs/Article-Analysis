HYDERABAD: Despite the   upholding the Hyderabad high court's order  , Hyderabadis are doing brisk business selling roosters, primed for a contest.

 Photos and advertisements of roosters for sale are on the rise on online classifieds ad portal  , ahead of Sankranti. The birds are on sale in `pets' section of the website, at prices ranging from '800 to '1.8 lakh.
 
 Fearing that these roosters could be used for cock fighting secretly in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, The Humane Society International, India (HSI) has sent a letter to  , CEO of OLX, urging him to withdraw all such advertisements.
 
 Declaring the sport “inhuman“ and violating the spirit of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, the court issued an order to prevent all cock fights and betting by January 31, 2017.
 
 Cock fights are popular during the Sankranti festival in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and involve speciallytrained roosters fitted with sharp metal extensions on their talons. The roosters are made to fight to the death.
 
 The OLX advertisements have been criticised by HSI for encouraging participation in an illegal activity. The advertisements were placed from several areas, including L B Nagar, Abids and Toli Chowki. They are advertised by colour, weight and type and occasionally classified under the 'urgent sale' category .
 
 Any promotion for sale of roosters, particularly during Sankranti, clearly violates the Supreme Court ban. Animal lovers and animal welfare organisations have demanded a ban on all advertisements for the sale of roosters with immediate effect.
 
 With Sankranti festivities set to begin from Friday, joint inspection teams, comprising a sub-inspector, a tahsildar revenue officer, a representative from the   or an NGO, have been authorised to enter any premises to seize roosters and related instruments used for cock fights. They can also confiscate the money meant for betting.
