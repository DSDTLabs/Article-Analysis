Bengaluru: A Kannada movie producer was arrested on charges of trying to attack a woman.

 Viresh V attempted to assault the woman while promising her a role in his upcoming movie. He was thrashed by family members of the girl, who evaded his attempts, police said.
 
 Viresh, who is currently in judicial custody, was running a few businesses as well. On Wednesday, he told the girl working in his Hosur office to meet him and discuss her role in the upcoming movie.
 
 He asked her to visit him at his house in Hulimavu. When she went, he allegedly tried to lock her up and attack her. The girl raised an alarm, ran out the house and with the help of the neighbours, locked him inside his house.
 
 Later she called her family, who assaulted him and demanded an apology. The incident was recorded on mobile cameras and shared with a TV channel. The video shows him apologizing for his mistake. 
 
 However, Viresh later registered a complaint about a group of men attacking his house. Based on the complaint, a case of assault was registered against the girlâ€™s family and they were arrested.
 
 Police said Viresh had produced a movie Preethi Maye Husharu in 2014, which flopped.
