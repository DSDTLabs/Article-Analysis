INDORE: With the door to door garbage collection system now a hit in the city, corporator of Ward Number 6 Deepak Jain has come up with a similar plan for cows — to feed   with food procured from door-to-door collections, 

 The move comes after cows he owned were seized by the civic body and kept in   sheds. The vehicle will collect food material from houses and deliver them to cow sheds in the area
 
 “We are preparing special vans to collect food such as leftover rotis and vegetable peels from houses to be used as food for the cows. Many residents of the area were eager to give food. This will also help us take care of the cows properly,” said Jain.
 
 Jain said the customized vehicles will have six compartments for different types of food collected. He added the vans will start to operate in a week. 
 
 After a civic body worker was stabbed to death by cattle owners,   had demolished several illegal houses of theirs. However, after they approached the chief minister, IMC has stopped its action and gave them an ultimatum to remove animals from the city.
 
 While the IMC’s drive to catch stray cattle continued, most cattle owners shifted their cows outside the city limits.
 
 The number of cattle on roads have gone down by a great extent. The civic body has also taken action against pig sheds and other such animal sheds.
