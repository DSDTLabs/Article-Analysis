PANAJI: Since 2013, government primary   have shut down at a rapid pace with 137 having to close operations for lack of enrolment. But there appears to be hope. Four   that had shut in recent years for want of students will be reopening in June 2018, director of education G P Bhat told TOI on Thursday.

 “A school has to have enrolment of at least 15 students to make a case for reopening. These three schools met this requirement and had applied for permission to begin operations and they have been granted the nod,” said Bhat.
 
 While three of the schools that are reopening in Keri-Ponda, Gaundalim in Old Goa and Curtorim in Salcette are Marathi medium schools, one in Vasco is an Urdu medium school. 
 
 Bhat said that until new teachers are recruited in   for the new academic year starting June 4, a redistribution of teachers in government schools has also been carried to meet the shortage in state-run institutions. Around 350 government primary schools have a single teacher teaching with help from para-teachers now provided under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.
