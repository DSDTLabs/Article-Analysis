MEERUT:   has booked three youths for allegedly uploading “caste-sensitive” materials on   sites, days after widespread clashes between people of Thakur and Dalit communities rocked the district leaving one dead and scores injured.

  “The post could have triggered another flare-up in and around Saharanpur district,” said Subhash Chand Dubey, senior superintendent of police (SSP).
 
  “Even after the Shabbirpur village and Saharanpur city clashes, social media was still being used to spread caste-sensitive messages to incite passion. This act comes under cyber crime. Keeping the sensitivity of the issue in mind, we have booked three youths -- Sachin Kumar, Nitin and Sachin Kushwaha -- under section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and 66F IT Act (intent to threaten unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India). On Tuesday night also, two persons were booked under the same sections," the SSP said.
 
  Meanwhile, Congress state president Raj Babbar visited Saharanpur villages, including worst-affected Shabbirpur, on Friday and met the families of victims.
 
  “So many caste and communal clashes in such a short span suggest that BJP government has failed on all fronts. We demand adequate compensation for those who have suffered losses of any kind,” he said.
 
  20 vehicles were torched and dozens of people, including policemen, were injured in large-scale violence between police and Dalits on Tuesday morning, after police forcefully dispersed members of the community assembling for 'mahapanchayat' in a city park without permission.
 
  They were protesting against May 5 Dalit-Thakur clashes that left one dead and dozens injured.
