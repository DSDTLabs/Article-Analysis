A day after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that Maharashtra has become an open defecation-free state following construction of more than 60 lakh   in the past three and a half years, a white paper by NGO   Foundation stated that there was a 64% disparity between male and female seats in public toilets as on December 31, 2017. 

 It stated that while there are 10,778 toilets for men,   have to make do with barely 3,909, and there are just 163 toilets for the differently abled. At the C Ward, which includes parts of Kalbadevi and Bhuleshwar and witnesses a large floating population, the disparity in the number of toilets for men and women was the highest at 335 to 49.
 
 Milind Mhaske, project director of Praja Foundation, said, “Figures such as these in a city like Mumbai are disheartening to say the least. More efforts are required to correct the situation.” Activists TOI spoke to, too, said that sanitation is still a burning issue.
