LUCKNOW: Union minister for water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, Uma Bharati accused UP chief minister   of turning Gomti into a nullah. “Riverfront development ke naam pe Adiganga Gomti ka kachra kar diya gaya hai (Gomti has been messed up in the name of riverfront development),” said the firebrand BJP leader here on Saturday. 

 She was in the city to canvass for various party candidates in fray. In a nukkad sabha for Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the candidate from Lucknow Cantonment, Uma Bharati said, “Nadi ke dono taraf diwar khadi kar di gayi hai ... issey Gomti sirf ek naala ban ke reh gayi hai (a wall has been raised on both sides of the river, turning it into a nullah).” 
 
 Adding that the project reflected upon Akhilesh Yadav’s competence, she said, “Yeh dikhaata hai ki Akhilesh ka kaam kitna bolta hai (his work speaks of his competence).” She also said that UP, under the leadership of Akhilesh, had not contributed for saving Ganga. 
 
 Hitting out at the alliance between Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress, Uma said, “Dono hi party kachra hain... (both the parties are like garbage).” She added that had the party not been a heap of garbade, a seasoned Congress leader like Rita Joshi wouldn’t have joined the BJP. 
 
 Campaigning for Suresh Kumar Srivastava, who is contesting from Lucknow (west), she said that the Congress had initially raised slogans like “UP behaal” and had planned to base its campaign on the same, but, it was fighting with the corrupt SP. “UP ko behaal kehne wali Congress ab behaal karne wali party ke saath gathbandhan mein hai.. yeh inki vishwasniyata darshata hai (The tie-up reflects on the Congress’ credibility),” she said.
 
 She said it was high time the SP was shown the door in UP. “Only the BJP can make UP an Uttam Pradesh,” she said. Srivastava, meanwhile, campaigned in Sheetla Devi ward and asked for votes. Union home minister Rajnath Singh might address voters and seek support for BJP on February 16.
