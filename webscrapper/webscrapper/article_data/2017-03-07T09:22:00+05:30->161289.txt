HYDERABAD: Hundreds of angry people from   and Telangana staged a dharna outside the local branch of the   (RBI) on Monday demanding the apex bank accept old notes till March 31.

 Nearly 2,000 people participated in the dharna when they were told by security staff that RBI branch was not accepting old notes anymore.
 
 They were shown the notice board which stated that only Mumbai and Nagpur would accept old notes. Most of the people had come from districts of Andhra Pradesh such as East Godavari, Srikakulam and other districts of Telangana with old notes.Many just brought small amounts of money, some lesser than Rs 5,000.
 
 “I am from a lower middle class family. For us to go all the way to Mumbai will exhaust all the money we have saved.The RBI local branch must consider taking the amount we have brought,“ said SK Ramesh who came all the way from Srikakulam.
 
 The Union government has announced that people can deposit old notes, but only at RBI offices, that too after providing a valid reason for missing the December 30 deadline. The new RBI deadline ends on March 31, but the facility is available in select branches only.
 
 Some   also participated in the dharna. “I was out of country for four months, now I cannot go all the way to Mumbai to deposit the cash.They have to reconsider their decision,“  , an NRI said.
 
 When contacted, RBI officials said that they cannot take any decision locally as the rule has been put in place by the Centre. “Enough time was given to people, we cannot really help on this,“ said an official.
