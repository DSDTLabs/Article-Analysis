Krishnagar: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday ticked off   superintendent of police Shees Ram Jhajharia over failure to contain road accidents, road rage as also the spurt in crime in the district.

 “Police need to be more vigilant in accident-prone zones and take action in the event of an accident. Police should also prevent impromptu road blockades at the drop of a hat. I can understand public sentiment following an accident. But that is not the case behind all road blockades. You should sit with local clubs against such tendency. I will also ask MLAs to give more importance to such disruptions,” the CM said at the administrative meet in Krishnagar.
 
 Banerjee was also displeased with the district’s crime graph. “There are law and order problems in the district. The police administration should take steps to curb crimes,” she said.
 
 State panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee also got a rap from the CM over the department’s lack of initiative in containing the spread of dengue and malaria in rural Bengal.
