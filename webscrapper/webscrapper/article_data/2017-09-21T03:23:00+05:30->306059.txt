Margao: Margao municipal council (MMC) has taken some serious steps towards shoring up its revenue.

 From bringing more traders into the trade tax net, to revenue recovery, to roping in corporates to fund infrastructural requirements of the civic body, the MMC is devising novel ways to ring in its coffers. While the single window system introduced by the civic body for one month is expected to net a revenue of over Rs 1 crore, MMC is also looking to recover arrears of over Rs 45 lakh towards rentals from the four fuel outlets located on municipal land.
 
 Speaking to TOI, chief officer of the MMC, Agnelo Fernandes said that the MMC has issued demand notices to the petrol pumps which have defaulted on payments. “The representatives of the fuel companies on Tuesday have agreed to pay up their dues,” he said. At its recent meeting, the council had passed a resolution empowering the municipality to take effective steps to recover the outstanding amount of nearly Rs 45 lakh from the four fuel stations.
 
 The four fuel stations have been set up on the land owned by the MMC, however, the petroleum companies have failed to pay the rentals over the last few years.
