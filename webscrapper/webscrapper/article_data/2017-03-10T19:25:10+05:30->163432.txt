MUMBAI: The much-awaited surgery that drew the world’s attention to Mumbai’s   where  , the  , has been admitted since February, was conducted successfully on Tuesday. Doctors are hopeful that she would shed another 100kgs over the next one-and-a-half months.

 The 37-year-old Egyptian, who previously weighed around 498kgs, was confined to her house for over two decades until arriving in Mumbai. Ahead of the  , Eman lost nearly 120 kgs that encouraged the doctors to go ahead with the high-risk procedure on Tuesday. Last week, she was able to to get up on her own and touch her toes. 
 
 Dr  , who is leading her treatment, said the decision to operate on her was a sudden one. “Her parameters were looked good and we didn't want to miss that window. We still can't believe we pulled it off.” The doctors performed a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on her where two-third of the stomach is removed. “We also removed her gall bladder as it had stones and could have created trouble later,” he said. 
 
 “She still has a lot of fluid reduction which will help her to shed over 100 kilos in 45 days,” he added. 
 
 Her girth has reduced to 151cm (around five feet). When she was flown to Mumbai in a specially modified Airbus, she was five-foot wide. “Now that she has shrunk, we could move her," he said. 
 
 Asked when she will be able to walk, he said, "Not yet, but in a year’s time hopefully. She hasn’t walked after the age of 11, so her legs have not developed. She shall need a lot of strength training.” He said samples of her intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat have been sent to Melbourne for analysis. “It is important to learn about tumour markers, genetic or other causes,” he said.
 
 “The future course is to correct her associated medical problems and get her fit enough to fly as soon as possible to Egypt,” he added.
