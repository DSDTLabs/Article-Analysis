SRIKAKULAM: Taking a dig at   Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, actor-turned-politician and   (JSP) chief Pawan Kalyan said he founded the party on his own with the support of the people unlike Naidu who had no role in forming the   (TDP).

 
 “With your support, JSP will surely form government after the 2019 elections,” Kalyan said to a large crowd at the Surangi Rajavari Ground after kicking off his 45-day statewide Jana Sena Porata Yatra in Kapasukuddi village. Kalyan lashed out against the AP CM in his speech, saying that he had supported the TDP in the 2014 elections keeping in mind Naidu’s vast political and administrative experience. “But now, Naidu’s vast experience has not yielded any results. Naidu’s rule paved way for corruption instead of development. I brought many public issues to Naidu’s notice, but he ignored my words,” Kalyan added.
 
 Kalyan said he would develop government institutions like  , which he claimed had weakened due to the AP CM’s support to Heritage Foods, which is owned by him.
 
 “Naidu spent ?2,000 crores for Pushkaralu in the state, but is reluctant to spend money on mitigating the   kidney issue in Srikakulam district,” Kalyan pointed out.
