NAGPUR:   Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said the central government has planned to construct 10 new   ( ). There is also a plan to convert all the existing government hospitals into medical college to improve health service and increase number of trained doctors in the country, he added.

 Gadkari said, “The government has plans to build 10   on deferred payment basis and the matter was discussed with the Prime Minister.”
 
 Gadkari, who was the chief guest, was addressing the inaugural ceremony of Indian Medical Association (IMA) annex, an elegant four-storey structure, at IMA’s JR Shaw Auditorium. Energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule was the guest of honour. MLA Milind Mane, Loksarang Hardas, who has made a donation, IMA president Dr Avinash Wase and IMA secretary Dr Archana Kothari were present on the dais.
 
 IMA has plans to set up a green building in place of the existing structure as its office. Bawankule announced that he will make available 50% of the funds required to construct the building.
 
 Gadkari pointed out that IMA premises lack parking space. He suggested to the association to club two plots on its premises and create space for parking. He said, “In the coming years, there will be a Metro station in front of the office. Hence, IMA needs to make proper parking arrangements.” This was the second event this year in which Gadkari mentioned that hospitals in Dhantoli and Ramdaspeth were constructed in an unplanned way. He said, “In the upcoming London Street project, sufficient space will be provided specially for building hospitals.”
 
 He said that he has known Loksarang Hardas’s parents who used to work at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). “This morning, Sarang came to me and said he wanted to do more for the city. I told him that I am planning to set up a convention centre here. The estimated cost of the project is Rs500 crore. Sarang said he will extend support in the best possible way.”
