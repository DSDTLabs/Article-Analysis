BENGALURU:   alias  , the first to escape the iron grills of Parappana Agrahara, is back in police custody. The North East division police arrested him in Kerala and recovered articles worth Rs 30 lakh, including   jewellery from the 28-year-old.

 A habitual burglar, Karthik, had entered police records in 2005 when he was just 16 and has since been arrested more than 15 times by Bengaluru police and their counterparts in other districts, an officer said on Saturday.
 
 A wanted criminal in more than 76 house burglary and robbery cases,   is a resident of Kalyan Nagar.
 
 Police said they arrested Kartik in Kerala on credible information given by two of his associates, who the   police had arrested earlier. “By the end of 2016, Kartik was involved in more than 13 house burglary cases in the city. Probes revealed that he and his associates masterminded these break-ins. His henchmen, who were arrested eventually, revealed his location,” police said.
 
 Senior police officers said Kartik is an absconder warrant too. “He has been skipping court hearings in more than a dozen cases,” police said.
 
 Born in 1989, Kartik discontinued his education after failing in Class 4. At the age of 12, he was caught by neighbours for stealing materials kept near house windows. He is married and has two sons.
 
 Kartik became ‘Escape Karthik’ after he made a good escape from   by concealing himself under a food van that had entered the jail premises to distribute meals. A special team had nabbed him 45 days later. In 2010, he managed to give police a slip again when he was being taken to a crime scene for inspection. This time, he was nabbed the very next day.
 
 M Jaishankar is the only other prisoner who escaped from Parappana Agrahara central prison. M Jaishankar, accused of serial rape and murderer, escaped from the prison on September 1, 2013 by scaling the high perimeter walls at night.
