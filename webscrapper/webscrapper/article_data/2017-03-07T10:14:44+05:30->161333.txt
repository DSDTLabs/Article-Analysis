CHENNAI: Mumbai were ecstatic on Monday afternoon but were left disappointed a few hours later as they crashed out of the   in the league stage itself for the second year in succession. Both Mumbai, who faced Goa at the   Pachaiyappa's Ground, and Gujarat were in contention for one spot and they knew the net run rate would prove to be the decisive factor.

 A breath-taking 99-run chase in just 5.4 overs wasn't enough for   & Co.(16 points) to seal a place in the quarterfinal as they lost out on the net run rate quotient to Gujarat (16 points), who defeated Bengal by seven wickets. Despite losing the toss Mumbai pacers   (317) and Shardul Thakur (227) broke the back o the Goa batting unit with a fiery spell up front, reducing their opponents to 21for four.
 
  (423) joined the party thereafter.Goa skipper and No. 3 batsman Sagun Kamat (23) was Nayar's first scalp caught by Shivam Dube and then he just ran through the lower-order to bundle Goa out for a paltry 95 in 35 overs.
 
 Mumbai's plan was to “finish it off in eight overs”. But openers   (4) and Shreyas Iyer (14) failed to deliver at the top. Surya Kumar Yadav (40 no, 11 balls, 4x4s, 3x6s) and skipper Tare (38 no, 11 balls, 3x4s, 4x6s) joined hands to take Mumbai home from 232.
