NEW DELHI: The   order of five   doctors — three senior residents and two junior residents — was   on Tuesday following strike by the Resident Doctor’s Association ( ). 

 In an order issued late evening, the institute registrar said that fact finding committee, constituted to look into allegations of medical negligence leading to death of nursing officer Rajbir Kaur, did not find any substantial evidence. “There is no substantial evidence of any intentional gross medical negligence by the treating team of   of obstetrics, gynaecology and anaesthesiology. Accordingly the suspension order is immediately revoked,” he said. A detailed report is likely to be submitted on February 15. Till then, officials said, the listed senior residents shall remain off duty.
 
 Earlier in the day, hundreds of resident doctors protested outside institute director’s office to demand revocation of the suspension order. The OPD and patient services were affected significantly. “How can they suspend doctors without inquiry? They should suspend the nurses involved too by that logic,” said a resident doctor.
 
 The nursing union, which is at loggerheads with the resident doctors over the issue, said they will hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the decision and decide future course of action. The nurses’ union had demanded action against the doctors and had threatened to go on strike, following which the five doctors were suspended on Sunday.
 
 Rajbir Kaur, a nurse with AIIMS, died during delivery through caesarean section. Kaur suffered a cardiac arrest during the surgery. During treatment, she lost her baby and was put on life support. She died on Saturday night.   and the RDA of various other hospitals have also come in support of AIIMS doctors.
 
 “Poor patients like us are being affected by this. My relative had to undergo surgery on Tuesday but that got delayed due to the protest,” said Mahender Singh from Bihar.
