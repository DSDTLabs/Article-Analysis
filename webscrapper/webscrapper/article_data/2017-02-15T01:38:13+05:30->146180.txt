NAVI MUMBAI: Even as the authorities are planning to beautify the   area next to Palm Beach Road in Belapur, locals are raising concerns over the restoration of the crumbling 446-year-old fort there.

 “We have heard that there are plans by   and   to beautify the Kille Gaothan area by building a public walkway, park and other such amenities,” said RTI activist Anarjit Chauhan. He added that care must be taken about the historical monument, which is already in bad shape. “Any further constructions must not hamper this structure,” he said. 
 
 Cidco spokesperson Mohan Ninawe agreed that there is a proposal to beautify the area. “We are aware about the importance of the historical monument. Although the fort is not on the heritage list, we are trying to restore it, as it will add value to the area,” he added.
 
 The local MLA, Manda Mhatre, also said that the local residents want the old fort to be restored. “Hence, I have conveyed to Cidco and NMMC that sincere efforts must be taken to make it possible,” she added.
 
 But Chauhan said that there may be a bridge and a flyover coming up at Belapur junction. “This can seriously affect the fort's foundation. So, the authorities must make a proper plan for the fort's restoration,” he added.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan confirmed that a flyover is being planned there to connect Nerul to Uran.
 
 At present, motorists going past the Palm Beach Road can see the watch tower section of the fort. According to historians, the Siddhi rulers had built it in the latter half of 16th century.
