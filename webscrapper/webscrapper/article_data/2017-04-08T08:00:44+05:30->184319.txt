VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) conducted a major drive on Friday to   in the congested Mangalbazaar and   

 In an unprecedented move, the civic body began the drive in the early hours to ensure that no street vendors came to the area to set shop.
 
 A better part of the streets in both the markets is occupied by street vendors and squatters leaving little space for two-wheelers or even pedestrians. While the VMC had removed the street vendors as well as encroachments by shopkeepers in the last couple of years, they eventually returned. Fingers were also being pointed at the civic body for conducting major demolition drives elsewhere in the city to broaden roads, but failing to handle the situation in these congested market places.
 
 VMC officials said that the drive was expected to continue till late in the night on Friday. The civic body collected eight truckloads of material from the market to clear the narrow streets and lanes there. Apart from this material, 12 shades, 80 metal angles and nine platforms erected without permissions were removed during the drive.
 
 Officials said that the drive was part of a larger plan to make the area inside four gates, Mangalbazaar, Navabazaar and around  , free of encroachments. Signage declaring the areas prohibited for street vending were put up in these localities. The civic body put up such boards even inside Kalamandirno Khancho, Munshi Khancho, Bajwada and other areas in the walled city. 
 
 To avoid trouble , the VMC had sought elaborate police security. Seventy police personnel from City, Raopura, Wadi and Navabazaar were roped in for the drive, which is expected to continue even on Saturday.
