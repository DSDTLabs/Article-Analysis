BHUBANESWAR: CPI (M) general secretary   on Wednesday said he will meet Odisha chief minister   on Thursday and discuss with him about fielding a non-NDA candidate in the upcoming presidential election.

 Yechury while deliberating on ‘Challenges before India today’ at a national-level seminar here said his party and most of the non-NDA parties have similar views on fielding a secular and democratic person as presidential candidate. “We want a responsible and dignified person for the coveted post, because president is the custodian of our constitution. We will zero in on a person, whom all parties will like,” he added.
 
 The communist leader said he has discussed with JD (U), Congress and NCP about the presidential candidate. “We all have similar view points on the issue. We will discuss with BJD and   also. I’ll meet Naveen tomorrow,” he added.
 
 When asked about the name of presidential candidate, he didn’t reveal anything. “Nothing is going to be done secretly. We will announce the name of the candidate after consulting with other parties,” he said. 
 
 On ‘triple talaq’, he said his party doesn’t support the present form of the triple talaq. “You are talking about uniform civil code. There are instances in all other religions, which will have to be discussed. But what happens that it is used for communal purpose, which we oppose,” he added.
 
 He lashed out at BJP and RSS for working on communal agenda in the country. “Women’s reservation bill was passed in Rajya Sabha, but the Lok Sabha didn’t pass it. Though the BJP government has clear majority in the lower house, why it doesn’t pass it? The party talks about injustice towards Muslim women, but doesn’t want to pass the bill,” he alleged.
