CHENNAI: Environment-conscious commuters can soon rent electric bikes to reach their destination from a metro station. Chennai Metro Rail Limited will add electric bikes to its last mile connectivity system. 

 Metro rail introduced bike rental services at two stations in February. CMRL is now in talks with the company providing bikes on rent for metro rail commuters in Bengaluru. It is planning to introduce e-bikes at stations that have high footfalls and later extend the facility to other stations depending on the demand. “Besides connectivity, the idea is also to be environment friendly,” said an official.
 
 Metro rail launched two-wheeler rental services at   and Airport last month. This, too, will be extended to other stations. Users can rent a two-wheeler, including Scooty Pep plus, Bajaj Pulsar, Royal Enfield and   from the stations. They can return it at any other station or any of the offices of the bike rental company SFA Motorcyle Rental – Kodambakkam, OMR and Chengalpet. All they have to carry are their two-wheeler license and an identity proof. They will also have to pay a refundable deposit of Rs 2,000 and rental fee of Rs 75 per hour. 
 
 Bangalore   launched bike rental services at 36 metro stations in February, 2018. The company Metro Bikes has been operating a fleet of more than 3,000 bikes including e-bikes and bicycles.
 
 Last mile connectivity has been a problem that metro rail has been struggling to address since they began operations in June 2015. While MTC’s small buses ply to a few metro stations, at some other places metro rail had to tie up with cabs. A few stations have share autos stops to pick up or drop passengers. Passengers still complain about lack of last-mile connectivity in some places.
 
 Metro rail is also taking environment-friendly steps. Metro trains have a technology where it generates nearly 35% of energy need for their operation, by using traction motors while they apply brakes.
