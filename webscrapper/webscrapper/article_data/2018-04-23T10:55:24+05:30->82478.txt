LUDHIANA: Where the colonisers are still awaiting the new policy of regularization of  , the officials of   ( ) are continuing their drive against the illegal colonies. Last week, the department recommended FIRs against 14 colonies, which were being developed in various areas of the city. In the coming week, the officials are going to recommend action against 10 more illegal colonies.

 The FIR has been recommended against the colonies in Jaspal Bangar, Rahon Road, Jassian and Laddian Kalan. The officials claimed that the developers did not stop the construction work in these colonies despite the fact that they imposed a ban on registries and also conducted demolition in these areas. Moreover, the buyers would get trapped once they will invest money in such illegal colonies where no development will take place in future. The policy is likely to cover only colonies developed till April 1, 2018, but the colonies being developed after this date will not be legalised at any cost.
 
 The estate officer (regulatory) of Glada Harpreet Sekhon said they have already recommended FIRs against 14 developers for constructing illegal colonies. He said the developers are not mending their ways despite several demolition drives so FIR is the last option. He said during the demolition drives, too, the staff faces several problems because they do not have police force attached to Glada.
 
 Notably, earlier the department had recommended around 70 FIRs against developers in the illegal colonies during January, February and March. The sources revealed that the officials are waiting for the regularization policy but it is yet to get the approval of the governor. Moreover, the colonisers are still pressing the government to admit their demands in the policy. Recently, a group of colonisers also met   MP   and placed their demands.
