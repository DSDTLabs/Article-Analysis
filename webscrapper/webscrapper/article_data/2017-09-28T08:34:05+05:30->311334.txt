A cross Kubhri Ghat in   district's Kada Dham, the sandy stretch is dotted with mounds covered with saffron sheets. A close look reveals they are not shrines, but graves.

 Sanjay Shukla, a resident of   village in Kaushambi district who buried his maternal aunt on the stretch, says as the Ganga receded downstream of Kanpur, the poor took to burying their dead on the banks.
 
 Earlier, when there was adequate water, people who could not afford a proper cremation would dump the body in the holy river for salvation. However, with increased vigil against dumping of bodies in the river, many now bury the bodies in   on the other bank, by taking the ferry across from Kubhri Ghat. Locals say such burials have increased in the past decade. Construction of dams in the hills and the increasing pollution has left the Ganga with not only reduced water but with a close to static flow, nearly halting the practice of floating the dead in the river.
 
 According to Avanesh Pandey , a mahapatra who traditionally performs the last rites, three to four bodies are buried at Kubhri Ghat every day . Many of these burials take place in summer when the water is at its minimum level, making it easier for people from Kada Dham to cross over to the Pratapgarh area.
 
 Abhay Misra, who has done extensive research on the Ganga and noted the social changes, says that these were not due to any new beliefs and practices, but solely necessitated by the decrease in the water level s of the holy river.
