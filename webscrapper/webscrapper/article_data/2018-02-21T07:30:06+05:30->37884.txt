NEW DELHI: State-run   has decided to terminate its loss-making retail experiment with   as unease over the nine-year-old venture mounts, following accusations of  's involvement in the over Rs 11,300-crore fraud that has rocked PNB.

 "We have decided to serve a notice to exit the venture," said a senior executive at the trading firm, which entered the jewellery and bullion business in a big way in 1992. MMTC holds a 26% stake, while   is the majority shareholder in MMTC-Gitanjali, that operates Shuddhi retail outlets.
 
 The joint venture had not made much headway, although the partners had lined up mega plans. After the launch in April 2009, the outfit planned to open 63 stores across the country over a span of three years. But there are only three stores currently, which sell gold and diamond jewellery. At one point of time, the number had increased to 11 but stores have shut down over the last few years.
 
 By all accounts, the venture never really took off with Gitanjali accused of not keeping its share of the promise. A company source said MMTC was to supply against bank guarantees from Gitanjali. But, the retail business did not perform according to expectations as the guarantees were not issued for close to five years.
 
 MMTC-Gitanjali has reported a turnover of over Rs 26 crore during 2016-17, marginally lower than Rs 28 crore in the previous year. Loss was estimated at Rs 2.5 crore in 2016-17. Sources said during the first nine months of the current financial year, the company was marginally profitable, with the surplus estimated at Rs 30-40 lakh.
 
 MMTC sources said against an investment of around Rs 2.5 crore, the public sector company had generated revenues of around Rs 4 crore from the JV.
