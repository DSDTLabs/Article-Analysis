Guntur: More than a fortnight has gone by since the diarrhoea outbreak claimed a dozen lives in   city, however the state government is yet to take stringent action against head water works officials.

 Locals are furious. “The officials do not value lives. Negligence has led to so many deaths. Scores are reeling at the hospitals. Worst of all, there are rumours that the state is protecting certain responsible officials,” said G Moeenuddin, a resident of Two Town area.
 
 Speculation is rife that big-ticket infrastructure and engineering firms are behind the state government protecting Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC) superintending engineer D Marianna and other head water works officials. Sources said at least three big firms, which are handling major projects worth nearly Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 1,600 crore in the city, lobbied in favour of the SE continuing in GMC till ongoing projects are completed. .
 
 Sources said a ruling party legislator jumped into action to save the top engineering officials from getting axed. Sources said the brother of the legislator is reportedly a sub-contractor in two major civil projects, including one in water works. Sources said infrastructure firms have asked the legislator to lobby and stay the transfer of the SE and other key officials.
 
 Although, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu had directed the municipal administration department to cleanse the entire administration in GMC following the outbreak of diarrhoea, the department spared SE and water works officials from disciplinary action. Sources said the department backtracked from axing SE Marianna and water works officials Dasari Srinivas, Prasad and Satyanarayana only due to the interference of the party legislator.
