 Talking about the issue of women empowerment, Bhagyashree said, "It is so disheartening to find so many girls, who reside in villages, still deprived of good quality education. We just cannot talk about empowerment till we educate our girls, instead we should do something about it." Extending her gratitude towards the women present belonging to different walks of life, Abha Singh said, "Why is that in our country, women have to sacrifice a lot? We understand that we live in a male-dominated society but then things will have to change for the better."
