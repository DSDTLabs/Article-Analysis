HYDERABAD: The   (TJAC) has charged the state police with repeatedly trying to intimidate its members. The tactics include repeated visits to members' homes and questions about their family history and relatives,   Prof M Kodandaram said on Thursday .

 Kodandaram was speaking after the TJAC meeting on a rally being organised on Feb 22 to give voice to the unemployed. The rally is to ask the government to keep its promise of filling up more than 1 lakh   and “to tell the government that the youth of this state is idle, they need to be given work.Employment creation has become a challenge in the   and the rally is an attempt to provide a future to the youth of Telangana who were at the fore front of the separate state agitation and hoped that their future will change for the better once the state becomes a reality.“
 
 Referring to actions of the police, Kodandaram said that “such behaviour is unfortunate.“ Drawing on his experiences during the separate statehood agitation, he added: “The TJAC is no stranger to such methods of intimidation. We faced this during the Telangana agitation.“
