We would all agree that   and   are two very classy people in B-town and no matter what they do, their presence always brings in a strong aura of positivity. And there was no exception when the two of them walked the ramp at a fashion show in Mumbai last evening. While Dia wore ‘mekhela chador’ – the traditional attire of the women of  , Saif charmed onlookers as the showstopper for a tribe-themed collection that had the state of Rajasthan at its heart. As always, Dia looked fresh as a flower and Saif looked like his true self — regal! 

 At the press conference of the show, Dia spoke about the deplorable condition that Indian handloom industry is currently in and urged everyone to work towards reviving this dying form of fabric. When asked about her thoughts on the costume, Dia said, “I think I will also speak on behalf of my designer because she is clearly very shy. Her collection reflects the rich heritage of Assam. I am wearing mekhala chador, which is their traditional dress and am very proud to be wearing it. Mekhala chador empowers women and we should try to preserve the heritage of Assam.” Saif, too, was all praise for the royal blue outfit that he was wearing and thanked the designer duo for making him their showstopper for the evening.
