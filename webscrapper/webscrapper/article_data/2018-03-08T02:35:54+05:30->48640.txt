NOIDA: A district court has ordered an FIR to be lodged against 15 directors of   (IRAL), for allegedly duping the owner of a software development firm of Rs 53.5 lakh, on the pretext of selling him a property in Gurgaon’s Sector 29. This, after a complaint was filed in Sector 49 police station on February 12, with a copy submitted to the Noida SSP, but an FIR was not lodged in the matter.

 The matter pertains to a property deal struck in 2012, when complainant Mukesh   was searching for a property to buy, which he could then give out on rent. 
 
 He was allegedly approached by the sales team of Appu Ghar in the TGIP mall of Sector 38A, who said they were planning to build an Appu Ghar in Gurgaon on the lines of Appu Ghar in Noida, which would contain commercial property. 
 
 Sharma ostensibly agreed to buy a 500 sq ft commercial property for Rs 53.5 lakh. Accordingly, he paid up the entire amount in two tranches by March 2012. However, the property did not materialise within the deadline. 
 
  He then approached police on February 12, but when they ignored his complaint, he approached the court of additional CJM 2, who, on February 28, directed police to conduct a probe in the matter under Section 156(3) of CrPc.
 
 “The court ordered police to lodge a complaint within a week,” Mukesh’s lawyer Rinku Sharma told TOI. A copy of the order is with TOI. However, the FIR is yet to be filed. “We are in the process of lodging an FIR in the matter,” said circle officer 2 Shwetabh Pandey.
