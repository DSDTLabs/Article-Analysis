NEW DELHI: With 14,000   pursuing advanced masters’ degrees in the UK, London wants to get an agreement of mutual recognition of qualifications with India much like the pact signed recently between France and India. 

 
 That is unusual in itself, given that Indians generally value British educational degrees. But with PM Narendra Modi travelling to the UK for a bilateral summit and CHOGM meet next week, UK high commissioner to India, Dominic Asquith said such a pact would be important for Indian students.
 
 India does not recognise a one-year masters degree which is given by all British universities, since India has a two-year program. This, Asquith said, made it difficult for Indian students to pursue a doctorate in India after a masters in the UK. 
 
 “We would be delighted if we could replicate it,” he said referring to the recent India-France agreement. “Discussions are under way, we would like them to be concluded soon.” There has been a 27% increase in Indian students to the UK, he said, and Indians get the biggest chunk of work visas issued by the British government. The bilateral summit, Asquith said, would stress on the “technology partnership.” “We’re looking at collaborative ventures in design, building , technology etc”.
