CHANDIGARH: With a view to making preparations and showing groundwork report to the   national president   during his three-day visit to   in July, a BJP legislators’ meeting has been scheduled on Wednesday in Haryana Niwas at Chandigarh.

 In his countrywide ‘Vistar Yatra’ (expansion programme), Shah is scheduled to visit Haryana from July 4 to 6. Shah’s 95-day tour started on April 25, and he would spend two to three days in each state to strengthen the party cadre and reach out to electorates ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Though no official meeting agenda has been circulated among BJP legislators, party sources said the main motive of Wednesday’s meeting was to bring all the MLAs together at the same platform, and convey the party’s strategy to increase party cadre. Responsibilities would be assigned to each   to take care of the party’s expansion exercise in their respective areas, and ensure dissemination of government schemes at the grassroot level through the party cadre.
 
 In view of the noticeable signs of power tussle in the Haryana cabinet in the past few months, and also around 16 party MLAs voicing their displeasure publicly against chief minister Khattar, the state BJP is trying to mend its fences before the visit of national BJP president. As Shah would be visiting the state, his focus would be to review the party’s performance in the state, and iron out differences among disgruntled legislators, who had in the past approached the central BJP leadership with their grievances.
 
 Earlier, during the two-day executive committee meeting of the   unit held at chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s hometown Karnal on April 24 and 25, a decision was taken that party workers would reach the booth level to inform the public about government welfare schemes from May 26 to June 10. In Wednesday’s meeting, the party MLAs could also express difficulties being faced by them in their constituencies or any other grievances during the meeting also to be attended by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, state BJP president Subhash Barala and cabinet ministers.
