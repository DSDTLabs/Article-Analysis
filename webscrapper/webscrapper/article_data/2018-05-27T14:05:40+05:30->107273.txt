VADODARA: After two back-to-back incidents of emergency in the court, the barricades and automatic barriers, which were placed in the complex to stop vehicles to drive right up to the court building, were removed on Friday.

 Ambulance could not reach till the court building on May 22 which had led to delay in treatment of an assistant sub-inspector resulting in his death. On May 24, some lawyers had to break low-height dividers to allow the ambulance reach the building after a litigant had collapsed due to heat. On both the occasions, the barricades and automatic barriers had proved to be a hurdle.
 
 After the barricades were removed, the district judge has directed the   ( ) to park their vehicles in a disciplined manner. When the ambulance had reached the court, the haphazardly parked vehicles also proved to be obstacles in its way.
 
 Principal district judge J C Doshi in his letter has mentioned that   was directed to ask its member to park their vehicles in the designated parking space, yet several lawyers have been parking their vehicles at the entry and exit point. The letter also stated that the barricades were placed so that the vehicles are not parked in the no-parking zone near the court building.
 
 “Since the vehicles are parked haphazardly, the parking space remains empty and during the times of emergency disorder prevails,” the letter stated. The bar association has been asked to instruct all of its members again so that they park their vehicles in the parking space.
 
 Earlier this week, the registrar of the court had even written to the traffic branch of city police to allocate traffic policemen so that no disorder is created.
