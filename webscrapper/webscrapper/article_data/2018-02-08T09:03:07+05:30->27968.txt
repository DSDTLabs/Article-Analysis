JAIPUR: State’s Barmer oil   turned into a battleground for a war of words between Congress and BJP leaders following   Narendra Modi’s remarks in the parliament on Wednesday.

 Delivering his motion of thanks to the President’s address in  , the prime minister remarked, “The way people of Rajasthan were misled about the Barmer refinery was appalling. Just for votes, lies were said. It is in the last three years that the government of India and the Rajasthan government worked together to sort out the pending issues.”
 
 Former chief minister   reacted sharply and tweeted, “Statement by PM   in the parliament related Barmer refinery is unfortunate. Sonia Gandhi does not lay foundation stone of any project for which the sanctions have not been issued.”
 
 Congress spokesperson Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said, “BJP’s humiliating defeat in Rajasthan bypolls made Modi make a low remark. The PM should rise above party politics and not talk like a BJP spokesperson. PM’s desperate remarks show BJP is losing the coming state elections even more badly.”
 
 CM Vasundhara Raje tweeted, “10 days before code of conduct came into place, Congress fooled people with a ceremony, for votes. No environmental clearances, no land identified and an enormous financial burden on state. Congress’s Barmer Refinery was built on lies and words-- testimony to their politics of deceit. (sic).”
