Singer   never thought that a chance meeting with director   at a friend's place in Delhi would open his doors to   for him. The Delhi-based singer, who is making Bollywood debut with the song Humsafar from ' ', happened to meet Shashank, the director of the film, at his friend  's Eid dinner. "It was two years ago when Huma introduced me to Shashank. She told him that I was a singer and a composer," says Akhil and adds, "He asked me if I could sing some original composition, and I sang 'Humsafar', the song that I had composed three years ago. He liked it and told me, 'Yeh gaana main le raha hun, I am writing a script and I want this song.' After a year, a day after Karan Johar decided to produce the film, Shashank kept his promise and called me, and that is how I got my big break."

  Akhil, a childhood friend of Huma Qureshi, tells us, "Huma and I were classmates at Rai Public School, Lodhi Road. She was the head girl and I was the head boy of the school. We have been very good friends since then."

  Akhil started his career six years ago as a lead vocalist of band Nasha, performing at different clubs and restaurants in Delhi, six years ago. "I started the trend of Sufi rock and live performances in Delhi’s nightlife, now everyone is doing that. It is good that the music scene in Delhi is quite vibrant, but it is also sad that there are some people who blindly follow others and sing Sufi rock just because it is popular and gets them money," says the singer. He adds, "I have seen Delhi’s nightlife change drastically in the last six years, but sadly, it is not what it could have been, thanks to policy changes that restaurateurs keep battling with and the strict timelines. Since I mostly stay in Mumbai now, I realise that unlike Delhi, it is much more chilled out, people can freely go out and party at night. Delhi can have a better nightlife than what it has right now."
