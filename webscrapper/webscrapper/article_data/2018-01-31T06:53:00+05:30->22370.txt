Nagpur: Yavatmal chief conservator of forests (CCF) GT Chavan, who was in the thick of controversy over flared up man-animal conflict in Pandharkawda division, was on Monday abruptly shifted to working plan in Pune. Chavan came in for severe criticism for inapt handling of the conflict where 10 humans have been killed by tigers in last 18 months. Chavan will be replaced by PG Rahurkar, who was with FDCM (North Chanda). In a major reshuffle, the state government on Monday shifted 22 Indian Forest Service (IFS) officials and promoted SH Patil as the principal chief conservator of forests (production & management). Patil, who was APCCF (CAMPA), will take over from KN Khaware, who will retire on January 31. CCF (education & training) Vikas Gupta, who has been promoted as APCCF, will replace Patil. In another surprise move, Rishikesh Ranjan, who was CCF & field director of Pench Tiger Reserve, has been shifted to FDCM (North Chanda). The post of Pench field director has been downgraded to conservator (CF) rank. Ranjan will be replaced by Ravikiran Govekar, who was filed director of Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR). Deputy conservator at Nashik RM Ramanujam was promoted and brought to NNTR. According to sources, the move seems to post a new field director for Bor Tiger Reserve bifurcating it from Pench. “The proposal is pending with the state government but it is learnt that IFS officials are not willing to accept Wardha as headquarters for Bor. Bor field director will look after Tipeshwar and Painganga wildlife sanctuaries too,” they said. Those transferred include CCF MM Kulkarni, who has been posted as CCF (research & training), Pune. Working plan CF AP Girhepuje and AS Kalaskar has been shifted to social forestry at Nagpur and Amravati respectively. Both were with working plan department. In another development, Wardha DyCF DW Pagar has also been shifted to Jalgaon. Pagar will be replaced by Sunil Sharma, who was posted in Melghat Tiger Reserve.
