Daltonganj: The  , medical education and family welfare ministry is set to launch a five-day immunization drive across the state two weeks after four children died from   in  .

 Dr  , director in chief of the state health services, on Sunday said the drive will try to cover the targeted 8.30 lakh children this year. 
 
 Four children under two years of age died within 24 hours after vaccination for Japanese encephalitis, measles and DPT at   village in Patan block of Palamu district on April 8. 
 
 Exact reasons behind the deaths are yet to be officially announced by the department even after a week. 
 
 The deaths triggered panic and all of Palamu are against immunization. The weekly vaccination drive on Thursday received lukewarm response, prompting the department to ponder over ways to win back the trust of people on vaccination. 
 
 However, it has been learnt that Loinga will be kept out of the state-wide drive. Without giving a specific reason, Mishra said, “The district health unit decides which villages have to be listed for the drive.” As many as 70 villages in Palamu will be covered under the new drive. 
 
 Mishra also said the department directed all 23 civil surgeons to reach out to the masses and convince them that their children will not be safe from diseases if they were not administered the vaccines. 
 
 “Inter-personal communication is required to be exercised in Loinga for restoring the faith of its people in vaccination,” Mishra added. 
 
 BJP MLA Radhakrishna Kishore questioned the conduct of health minister Ramchandra Chandravanshi in the Palamu incident. The Chattarpur MLA asked, “When will our health minister take out time to meet the bereaved families in Loinga? It is more than a week and he is busy elsewhere.”
