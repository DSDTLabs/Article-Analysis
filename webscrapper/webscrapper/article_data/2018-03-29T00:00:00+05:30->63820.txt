Dancing to English songs at the nightclub is one thing. But shaking a leg to a kuthu paattu is another feeling altogether! Last year saw a host of interesting party numbers from   striking a chord with the audience. The one topping the list of the Chennai Times Best Party Songs of 2017 is   from Thaanaa Serndha Koottam, which was literally heard throughout patti-thotti. Anthony Daasan’s powerful rendition in Anirudh’s music played a huge role in catapulting this song to the top slot. From typical kuthu songs to folksy numbers and even traditional tunes, the chart has it all.
