JALANDHAR:   unit of   has announced to oppose likely return of   Arvinder Kaur Oberoi and her husband  , a former councillor, to Shiromani Akali Dal while stating that party would register its opposition with Akali top brass through its president Vijay Sampla. Oberois had dumped SAD to join   (AAP) a few months before Punjab assembly elections. Even in municipal corporation, their strained relations with mayor Sunil Jyoti of BJP have been coming to fore in meetings of the house, and both sides have been attacking each other.

 They had met SAD president Sukhbir Badal in Delhi a few days ago and on Monday, Kuldeep made it public that they would rejoin Akalis soon. BJP district president Ramesh Sharma issued a statement criticizing Oberois. He said BJP would oppose their re-induction into SAD as they deserted the alliance and worked against it in the assembly elections. “After AAP lost elections, they want to return to SAD. Our party would raise the issue before top SAD brass through Sampla,” he said.
 
 Asked about it, Kuldeep said he had been with Akali Dal for the several years and it was their “home coming”. He said that BJP had no moral ground to oppose their return to SAD. “Everybody knows that I had to leave SAD due to atmosphere created by BJP and now we told Sukhbir that we want to join our original party and that would happen after the latter returns from abroad,” said Kuldeep.
