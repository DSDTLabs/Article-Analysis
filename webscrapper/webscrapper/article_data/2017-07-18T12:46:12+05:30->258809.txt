Apparently, her younger brother   is all set to make his debut as an actor with a short film titled 'Rock N Roll', directed by  . The poster of the film was also shown and it’s pretty interesting depicting a hand holding a gun, another hand holding a knife, an Rs 100 note. A story of “sex, guns and a bunch of idiots” is the caption. Sharing the pre-look of the short film, Rakul tweeted, “All d best my lil brother @jap_aman 4 ur first short film . This is just d beginning.. lots of loveee n luck 😊😘..” It wouldn’t come as a surprise if this short film is just a precursor to Aman making his feature film debut in future.
