 CGovindakrishnan, founder of  , a school for the visually impaired, says that in 15 years of running the institution, he has not seen a child as determined as Nightingale, an orphan from  , who joined his school a few years ago. “Nightingale had to work for five years until she got a chance to study again. She was patient and determined and passed with flying colours,” says Govindakrishnan.
 
 
 Nightingale wrote the exam for two subjects — maths in which she scored 90, and English in which she got 65 —as she had appeared for her Class X exam five years ago, but could not write these two papers because there was no one to teach her the subjects. So, for five years she worked at making handicrafts at  . “I wasted five years. I could have finished my education by now. I want to be a social worker and help differently-abled people,” says the 19-year-old.
 
 Her classmate P   scored 370. Originally from Madurai, Harishankar’s family moved to Chennai so he could continue his education, as Nethrodaya provides free tuition and accommodation. His father, who owned an idli shop in Madurai, now works as a watchman at the Stanley Medical College and Hospital just so he can be closer to his son. “Sometimes I take on extra shifts during the week so I don’t have to work weekends because those are the only day]s I get to meet my son as he stays at the Nethrodaya hostel,” says his father L Pazhaniandi. “My ambition is to become an engineer,” says Harishankar, adding that it is his father’s support that sees him through his challenges.
