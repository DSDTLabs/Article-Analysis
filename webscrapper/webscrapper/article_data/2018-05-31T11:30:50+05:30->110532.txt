TRICHY: The executive committee of the Tamil Nadu graduate teachers’ association which met at Perambalur on Wednesday sought to consider appointment of graduate teachers as head masters of high   in the state. 

 While three per cent of the total number of assistant elementary education officers and block education officers are appointed as head masters of high schools, state president of the association   urged for cancellation of the move. 
 
 The meeting passed a resolution seeking promotion of   to the post of HM in these schools.
 
 He said that the state government on one side asks post graduate teachers to handle classes IX and X in the name of reforms and on the other hand shows surplus in graduate teachers, who are meant to handle these classes.
 
  “Not only should the government drop such moves, but lower the student teacher ratio to 1:20 and recruit additional graduate teachers,” he said. 
 
 The meeting also sought the rollback of Right to Education (RTE) Act terming it to promote private schools at the cost of government elementary schools, as the 25 per cent seats reserved in these schools are filled by students who should have been enrolled in government schools.
