GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat government has planned to organize an International Children Film Festival in Gujarat for the first time prior to the 9th Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) in January 2019 . The state tourism department plans to replicate the international children film festival model for attracting more tourists and to cater to the local audience. 

 The state tourism department is likely to organize the festival before or during the Vibrant Gujarat Global Investor Summit (VGGIS)-2019. The Gujarat government has tied up with the   of India for technical support and is also likely to take the help of the Children’s Film Society of India (CFSI). The state government has already allocated Rs 10 crore for organising the event.
 
 Jenu Devan, managing director, Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Ltd (TCGL) said: “The government has planned to organise an international children film festival in the state to attract international and national tourists to the state as well as benefit film enthusiasts. In many parts of the world and some places in India, film festivals attract a lot of tourists. Hence, as part of the government policy, TCGL is organising this festival.”
 
 “We are planning to organise during or before the upcoming Gujarat Vibrant Summit in which we expect participation by all leading countries as well as people from different parts of the country. The state government has a very attractive policy for film-making in Gujarat,” Devan said. 
 
 “In the recent past, a number of major movies were shot in the state. We have the best variety of locations in Guarat. The children’s film festival will show different foreign and Indian languages movies. We aim to organise related seminars also. The main events of the festival will be held in Ahmedabad while other events will be organised in a few other cities of Gujarat to market as many possible tourist places of the state besides giving exposure to international films to the local audience,” Devan said.
