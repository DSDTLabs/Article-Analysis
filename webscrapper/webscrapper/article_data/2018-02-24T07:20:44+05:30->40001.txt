NEW DELHI:   Chidambaram on Friday sought the SC's protection from what he called "malicious prosecution" by the CBI and the ED to harass him, his wife and business associates in the "garb" of a probe into the alleged irregular foreign investment clearances for Aircel-Maxis and   by his father P Chidambaram as the then finance minister in 2007. 

  Karti's petition said, "The FIR is manifestly attended with malafides and the FIR has been lodged maliciously with an ulterior motive of seeking vengeance on him because he is the son of P Chidambaram..." 
 
  Karti's counsel, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Gopal Subramanium, told a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Amitava Roy and D Y Chandrachud the ED had initiated proceedings on the basis of the CBI's FIR and was repeatedly raiding business firms and associates of Karti just to harass him and his family members. The SC deferred hearing on the matter till March 6.
