BARWANIi: A tribal  , Rita Bai, delivered a   inside a 108   on way to Barwani district hospital on Saturday. Both baby and mother are safe and doing well.

 Rita was admitted at Nilwali government hospital on Friday. She was referred to Barwani due to lack of caesarean facility in Nilwali. The 108 ambulance was called up, but midway through the journey, she gave birth to a boy, said Barwani chief medical and health officer Dr VB Jain. 
 
 “At Chikhlia, some 23 kilometres from Niwali, the expecting woman gave birth to a boy inside the ambulance. It was a normal  ,” said ASHA worker Basanti Barde, who accompanied Rita in the vehicle. 
 
 The family members said that after travelling a distance of 30 kilometres from Chikhlia they reached the district hospital. But they had to sit in the ambulance for about 20 minutes and wait for the hospital employees to transfer the mother and newborn in labour room.
 
 The district hospital civil surgeon Dr Anita Singare told TOI that the staff came late since they were already operating a delivery in the labour room. The newborn was shifted to the labour room safely soon after the delivery was done. His mother was admitted after sometime for further treatment.
 
 She said that the strike of contract employees has been going on since February 19, but facilities have been retained in several hospitals through alternative arrangements.
