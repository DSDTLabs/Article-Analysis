HYDERABAD: Given the political acumen that he is known for, it is too early to say whether Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar will fly to Bengaluru to attend HD Kumaraswamy’s swearing in-ceremony as the chief minister of Karnataka on Wednesday.

 
 This is how sources close to CM   reacted when asked to confirm whether he would be attending the event which is all set to turn into a show of unity of regional parties. “When KCR appealed to the Telugus during election campaign in   to vote for JD (S), it was contesting independently with Congress and BJP as its main rivals. Now, the entire political situation has changed with JD (S) and Congress coming together in a post-poll alliance,” said the source.
 
 CM KCR will reportedly wait for clarity to come on the list of participants who would be attending the swearing-in ceremony, before taking a final call. With the news of AP Chief Minister N   having decided to attend the event, it has become all the more interesting to see whether KCR would go keeping in view plans to form a federal front at the national level.
 
 However, some of the TRS leaders said that KCR is positive to go the swearing-in ceremony given his equation with HD Deve Gowda. Both   and   had called KCR before sending their MLAs to Hyderabad to prevent poaching by the BJP and true to their trust, every legislator returned safely.
