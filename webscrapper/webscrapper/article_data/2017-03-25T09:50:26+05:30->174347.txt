DHARAMSHALA: A section of the Australian media called him the `Donald Trump of world sport,' but Indian skipper refused to be drawn into the controversy. “Good luck to them if it's selling their news,“ he said here on Friday . “These things do not matter to me so much, they have never mattered,“ Kohli said.

 “I have faced this initially in my career and many times before. I have always stuck by the right thing... I have always done the right thing. I have always said what I wanted to because I felt it was right. I have no regrets about it. I have nothing to go back to and change,“ the skipper added.
 
 “If you want to write something good or bad, it's your personal choice.I am not going to sit here and say (you) write good things about me or write bad things about me. It's your choice,“ the captain retorted.
 
 After the intervention of two cricket boards to calm down things, the Ranchi Test witnessed a see-saw contest. In the end, the Aussies fought out of their skins to secure a draw and keep it 1-1 with a Test to play.
 
 Following that, visiting captain   said the momentum has shifted towards Australia, but Kohli doesn't agree.
 
 “Coming from behind after (Australia's) first innings total of 451 in Ranchi and having a shot at winning the game, obviously we would like to think as a team that we turned things around beautifully . They had to bat out for a draw, which didn't look the case when they scored a big total in the first innings,“ he said.
