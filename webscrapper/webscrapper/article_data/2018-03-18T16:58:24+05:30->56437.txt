Veteran actor and superstar Kamal Haasan’s elder brother   passed away on 18 March, last year. He suffered a cardiac arrest. He was 82. On his first death anniversary, an emotional Kamal posted a heartwarming message for his brother.

 Fondly remembering him, Haasan wrote on Twitter, “In memory of Mr Chandrahasan. A brother who was like a father to me. A partner who was also my guru. The only share in my profits he ever asked was to see me win. Fortunate to have been his brother when even knowing him would have been great enough.”
 
  
 Chandrahasan is the younger brother of legendary actor Charuhasan. It’s worth mentioning that Chandrahasan was the pillar of Kamal Haasan’s   that was established in 1981 with the Tamil-Telugu film ‘Raaja Paarvai’. The production house has produced several path-breaking films such as ‘Aboorva Sagotharargal’, ‘Thevar Magan’, ‘Virumaandi’ and ‘Vishwaroopam’. 
 
 On the work front, Haasan has three films in the pipeline. The much-awaited ‘Vishwaroopam 2’ has been passed with a ‘U/A’ certificate by the CBFC board and is all set for a massive release this summer.
 
 Kamal Haasan is also reuniting with director   for ‘Indian 2’, which is expected to take off in Hyderabad later this year. ‘Ulaganayagan’ also has the trilingual action comedy ‘Sabash Naidu’, a Balram Naidu spin-off from ‘Dasavatharam’.
