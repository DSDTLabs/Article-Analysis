With lyrics that begin with “Appa James Bond, Maga Anna Bond” you get no extra marks for guessing which Kannada star this song is dedicated to. What’s special is the fact that the star —Puneeth Rajkumar — promises to really dance his way into the hearts of people with this new song,  , the teaser for which will hit social media tomorrow, in time for his birthday.
Quite like the name of the song, this number sees Puneeth showcase some heavy-duty cool moves, choreographed by   (from the Telugu film industry). The film’s director, Santosh Ananddram, has himself penned the lyrics of the song that is composed by   and sung by Priya Himesh and Santosh Venky. Another highlight is that this song reaches out to Puneeth’s biggest fans — children. “We have around 30 children who are part of this song, in addition to 50 other dancers. Kids enjoy watching Puneeth dance and he has danced through an entire song for this one after a long gap. It is an out-and-out tapanguchi number that’s been shot stylishly,” says Karthik Gowda, from the film’s team. Watch out for Appu Dance tomorrow.
