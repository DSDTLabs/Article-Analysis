MUMBAI: In order to increase the polling percentage, chief minister   has suggested that voting be made mandatory.

 Fadnavis said that this should be considered at least for the elections that are being conducted under the   election commission. 
 
 Fadnavis was speaking at a conclave on ‘democracy, elections and good governance’ organised by the state election commission on Friday. Fadnavis also said that all the local bodies should go to polls together.
 
 The chief minister also asked the state election commissioner JS Saharia to conduct a study for reforms in the election process for local bodies across  .
 
 Fadnavis said, “We need to consider making voting mandatory for the elections being conducted as per state election law.” He said that there are people who comment about policy decisions but never vote. “We also need to consider conducting elections of all the local bodies at a time. If it happens then stress on the state election commission,   and police can be reduced,” Fadnavis said. During his tenure as Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi had introduced a bill seeking to make voting compulsory in the elections to the local self-government bodies.   veteran L K Advani had also supported the move.
