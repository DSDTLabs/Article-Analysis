A day before  's 96th birth anniversary, Mirror has learnt that Ananth Narayan Mahadevan is adapting a story, 
 , by the auteur for the screen. The 90-95 minute film, produced by  , will feature   and   as the protagonists.

  He hopes to be ready by January 2018 so he can enter it for next year's Cannes International Film Festival where Ray's first film, 
  bagged the 'Best Human Document' Award in 1956. 
 
 "Years ago, when I was doing television, I'd approached his son, Sandip Ray, for the   to a 
 story and was turned down because he wanted to carry the franchise forward himself. But this story, which my documentary filmmaker friend Tapobrati Das read out to me in its original form, is one that cannot be made in Bengali.
 
  Ray plays beautifully between the mother tongues of the duo - Bangla and Gujarati - with Hindi as the linking language," explains Ananth who has been developing the screenplay with India's animation pioneer, Bhimsain's son, Kireet Khurana.
 
  
  
 This time Sandip's scepticism was deflected with the promise that 
  would either be a royal tribute to the master or else Ananth's swan song. And since his father had made only one feature film in Hindi, 
 , apart from a TV film, 
 , Sandip is excited to see one of his baba's stories translating into a Hindi film. "When we shoot in Kolkata in July, he's promised to visit the set and also give us a grand tour of Ray's home and memorabilia. I'm looking forward to the pilgrimage," Ananth exults.
 
 He's shot some portions in Kolkata during Durga Puja last year and plans to return to the City of Joy with Paresh in July. Naseer who's busy with a new play, will join later when they move to Ahmedabad.
 
 In an interesting casting against type, Paresh plays the Bengali babu, with a vow to get the look and accent right. Naseer has been roped as the Gujarati businessman.
