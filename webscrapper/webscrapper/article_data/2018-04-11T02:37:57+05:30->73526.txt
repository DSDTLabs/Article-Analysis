MUMBAI: The Alibaug sessions court on Tuesday rejected the   application of gangster Chhota Rajan’s   Deepak  , who has been accused of rape by a 22-year-old engineering student. 

 “We will now arrest him soon,” said a Panvel police officer. 
 
 Nikhalje’s lawyer Manasi Mahtre, while seeking his anticipatory bail, claimed her client was innocent. 
 
 Now, Nikhalje is likely to move the Bombay high court.
