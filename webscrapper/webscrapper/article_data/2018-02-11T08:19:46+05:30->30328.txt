NEW DELHI: Warm conditions continued during the day on Saturday with the maximum temperature touching 25.6 degrees Celsius — three degrees above normal. However, the capital is likely to see some respite from Sunday, with light to moderate rain forecast for Sunday night and Monday morning, met officials said. 

 
 
 
 
 Officials from the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) in Delhi said the rain is likely to affect maximum temperature, bringing it down to as low as 18 degrees C over the next two days. 
 
 “While the minimum is unlikely to be affected by the rain as it is already below normal for the season, the maximum may fall by 5-6 degrees,” said Kuldeep Shrivastav, scientist at RWFC. 
 
 Delhi’s minimum temperature was recorded at 6.1 degrees Celsius on Saturday, which is four notches below normal for this time of the season. Humidity meanwhile oscillated between 28 to 100 percent over the last 24 hours, met officials said. 
 
 The capital’s air quality was recorded in the lower half of the “very poor” category according to CPCB’s Air Quality Index (AQI) with a reading of 320. Experts say this, however, is likely to come down with the rain.
