GAYA: Expressing disappointment over the slow pace of work on the four-laning project of the Dobhi-Gaya-Patna NH 83 that links the state capital with G T Road in Dobhi,   on Wednesday evening regretted that his repeated pleas to Union road transport minister   in this regard had failed to expedite the project execution.

 Tejashwi, who was in   to inaugurate Buddha Mahotsav, said he would again meet the Union minister soon in this regard. The Masaurhi-Patna part of the road is in a very bad shape, and needs priority, he said.
 
 Though only 15 months are left of the four-year schedule for completing the project, not a single kilometre of the 127-km route has so far been four laned. The project was scheduled to be completed in April 2018, but little work has been done except odd earthworks and tree felling.
 
 The National Highway Authority of India, on April 24, 2014, awarded the Rs 2,015-crore contract to IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company Limited, fixing April 9, 2018 as the deadline. Besides four laning the stretch, the company has to construct 11 major bridges, 17 minor bridges, three service roads, three road overbridge and 218 culverts. The project is funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency.
 
 The Dy CM also made an interesting revelation that though he visited Gaya and Bodh Gaya on numerous occasions in the past, he had never been to world-famous Mahabodhi Temple. It was only on Wednesday evening that he first entered the shrine. 
 
 “Maybe Lord Buddha wanted me to visit the shrine after becoming Dy CM,” Tejashwi said, adding he would love to do some meditation on the temple premises.
