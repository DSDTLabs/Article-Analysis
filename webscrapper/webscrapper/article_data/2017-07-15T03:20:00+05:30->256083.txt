Panaji: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Friday seized 14kg of   (marijuana) worth Rs 7.15 lakh at Mala Link Road, Panaji, and arrested three Odisha natives. A juvenile who hails from Jharkhand was also nabbed, an official of the bureau said. 

 This is one of the largest seizures of the banned drug in recent times. Subash Mali, Ranjit Singh and Taruj Kumar Pallo have been placed under arrest, said an NCB official. The juvenile has been lodged at the state-run protective home at Merces.
 
 The official said that the raid was conducted following a tip-off on a potential transaction taking place in the city. All the four arrested were found to be working either as helpers or labourers.
 
 Investigations revealed that the narcotics were sourced from Odisha. 
 
 “The NCB is trying to find the others involved in the conspiracy,” NCB superintendent Jitendra Ranjan said.
 
 Two days ago, Vasco police had seized 4kg of ganja worth Rs 4 lakh near Dabolim airport from an Odisha native who was found to be operating from a temporary hutment erected near the Goa International Airport at Dabolim. Last month, Margao police had arrested one person at Navelim who was found to be in possession of 3kg of ganja.
