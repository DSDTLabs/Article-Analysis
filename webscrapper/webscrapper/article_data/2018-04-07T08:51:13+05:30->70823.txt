GOLD COAST:   may have nothing much left to prove to her critics, even as she finds herself at the receiving end more often than not. The latest controversy arose with her letter to the   (IOA) asking them to give accommodation to her dad Harvir Singh in the Games village or else she would not play in the  .

 
 
 
 Reacting to the bad publicity over the issue, Saina’s father Harvir said he was upset with all that had been written and discussed about the episode in the media. “I was left in the lurch in the middle of the night (around 11 pm) after landing here last Friday. There was no one (read from IOA) to help me as I didn’t have a place to go and my name was missing from the list of officials who could enter the village. Finally, I was helped by an official from the  ,” Singh told TOI here as he watched Saina defeat Scotland’s Julie Macpherson in the mixed team match. “She (Saina) only reacted out of her respect for me,” Harvir added.
 
 Harvir said all the expenses for his trip have been taken care of by Saina. “She would have spent a few lakhs and still when I came here there was no place in the Games village even though all the other three names (from badminton) were there. I was never her personal coach and have always been a technical official,” the retired agricultural scientist said.
 
 “On Friday, I stayed outside and I went in to the village on Saturday on a day pass like other personal coaches. But finally, it was sorted out and I moved in on Saturday,” he added.
 
 A peeved Harvir said he is not in   to see the beaches. “My girl is playing here and I have come to support her and not see the beaches at this old age. I have travelled around, spending my money to be with her and I never had any special attraction to come here,” he added.
