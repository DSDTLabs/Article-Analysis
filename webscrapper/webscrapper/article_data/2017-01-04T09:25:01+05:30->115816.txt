VADODARA: Harikrishna Bhuriya, son of Limkheda BJP MLA  , committed suicide at his residence on Monday evening. Thirty-two-year-old Harikrishna was alone at his home in Agara village in Limkheda taluka of Dahod district when he hung himself in his room. Vichchiya lost his second son within 20 days as his elder son Indravadan had died in a road accident in Madhya Pradesh on December 14 last year. 

 Harikrishna’s wife Dharmistha was recently elected sarpanch of Agara village in Limkheda. “Harikrishna was a sensitive person and was close to his brother. His mother had died last year and his eldest brother is suffering from cancer. Harikrishna’s family said he was very tense over the last few days after Indravadan’s death. He was worried about his family,” said P P Bhoi, police sub-inspector, Randhikapur police station. 
 
 “He seemed depressed over the last few days. On Monday when his family was away, he took the extreme step. Investigations showed that there was no foul play,” Bhoi told TOI.TNN
