 Overall, 35 confirmed swine flu patients are currently under treatment in private hospitals. In all the cases, swab samples were found to be H1N1 positive by the Institute of Preventive Medicine.

Six new cases were reported in the city on Monday — three from Hyderabad, two from Ranga Reddy/Medchal and one from Patancheru.
 
 Health officials told TOI that the prevailing cold wave condition in the city is likely to aggravate H1N1 infections unless adequate preventive measures are taken.“Swine flu tends to occur and spread more in cold weather even though the virus is in circulation throughout the year. Preventive measures include vaccination, keeping distance from people suffering from cough and cold, frequent washing of hands and avoiding undue exposure to cold weather,” said  , consultant general physician at Apollo Hospitals, Hyderguda. Experts advise people battling diabetes, those above 65 years as well as those suffering from kidney problems and asthma to protect themselves from the cold.
