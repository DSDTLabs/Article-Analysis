Vadodara: As Narendra Modi took a historic step by becoming the first Indian PM to visit Israel, a Gujarati aims to take the relations a step further. 

 Nikitin Contractor, who too has been invited to Israel by the Indian embassy, has decided to start an Israeli cultural centre in the city. “We will make a proposal to the Israeli government to open a cultural centre in Vadodara. We already have a piece of land here. I am sure that the proposal will be taken positively,” said Nikitin, who is convener of Friends of Israel, Vadodara chapter. Nikitin, who has been rooting for close ties between India and Israel for decades, sends several Indian students for work in Israel every year. 
 
 “We have a good piece of land adjacent to the Jewish cemetery in the Nizampura area. It can be used to build the cultural centre. The land and the cemetery is under the possession of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) so I will also meet the municipal commissioner to take the project ahead,” Nikitin told TOI. When asked what the centre will offer, he said, “It will have an exhibition hall and space to host cultural Indo-Israeli programmes. A library too would be made in the centre. The Israeli government will have to fund the project.” 
 
 Nikitin hopes that the goodwill created by Modi’s visit to Israel will help in putting the project on fast track. “I had also visited Israel in 2014 with the then Vadodara Mayor Bharat Shah to discuss collaboration between Vadodara and Ashkelon in Israel in the areas of education, environment and cultural exchange programmes.” Nikitin and 100 students from India participated in programmes that were organized by the Israeli government. “It’s a great gesture that will go a long way in developing closer ties between the countries,” Nikitin added.
