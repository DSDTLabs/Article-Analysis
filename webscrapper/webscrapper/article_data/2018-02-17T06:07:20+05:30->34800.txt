CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader   here on Friday welcomed chief minister   and his cabinet colleagues' decision to pay their own income tax this year and said his party's legislators were willing to follow suit, but only if the CM took "genuine" austerity measures to pull Punjab out of its financial mess. 

 Khaira, who is the leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly, said charity began at home and demanded the CM first "set an example by disbanding the army of his advisers and officers on special duty ( )". "He already has a top-heavy bureaucracy," said Khaira, adding that the CM had 10 officers at the post of additional chief secretary, dozens of financial commissioners, and scores of administrative secretaries. "Why should the CM need 19 more people to advise him and assist him when he has officers trained to run his government?" he said. Khaira said the CM was wasting the taxpayers' money on commissions and using them to "adjust his near and dear ones". "The  , which was constituted to inquire into the infamous mining scandal, submitted its report on August 10, 2017. But, nothing has been heard of it after that. A lot of public money was spent on it, but without any tangible result," said Khaira. 
 
 Khaira said the  's "logic" that the state would save Rs 11 crore if all MLAs and ministers paid their own income tax was amusing. "Compared to this, the monthly cost of the CM's 19 advisors and OSDs alone would be more than Rs 11 crore; many of them have been bestowed the ranks of cabinet minister and minister of state. All of this entitles them to salary, TA, DA, bungalows, car, staff, and security," Khaira added.
 
 Of the 117 Punjab lawmakers, 95 (81%) are crorepatis, according to a report from the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), an independent outfit promoting transparency. Yet in percentage terms, the present House has 7% fewer crorepatis than the previous assembly.
