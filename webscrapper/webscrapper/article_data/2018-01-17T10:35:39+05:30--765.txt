BHOPAL: School and college bus operators will go on indefinite strike from Wednesday to protest the crackdown by traffic police and government. 

 School bus driver's and conductor's association is demanding to do away with online police verification and lay a procedure during checking drives to prevent harassment of bus drivers and operators. After the association called for the strike, district administration held a meeting with them on Tuesday but it remained inconclusive and the bus drivers refused to call off their strike.
 
 Association president Shiv Kumar Soni said since most drivers are not e-literate it is difficult for them to get online verification done. "We have demanded district administration to set a process of conducting checking drives without pressurizing or harassing us."
 
 ADM Disha Nagwanshi said, "I met members of the association. I also informed them that they don't have to get verification done immediately."
