Nagapattinam: For the first time in Tamil Nadu, the Nagapattinam district administration has appointed three transgenders as para legal volunteers (PLV) to spread legal awareness among the public and also assist the District Legal Services Authority during Lok Adalat.

 District collector S Sureshkumar handed over the appointment orders at an event held here on Wednesday. They will educate people, especially those belonging to weaker sections of the society, to enable them to be aware of their right to live with human dignity, the collector said.
 
 Addressing the event, the district collector said, “A first for the state, we have nominated three transgenders to engage in social service so that they can impart basic rights to a layman, more particularly workers coming under the unorganised sector.” 
 
 The tenure of the volunteers would be one year. After proper training on basic laws, these volunteers would be allowed to deal with cases.
 
  The volunteers who show more involvements would be given a chance to sit along with the panel members of Lok Adalat, officials said.
 
 The volunteers will also make people aware of the nature of their disputes, problems and advise them on which forum to approach so as to resolve their disputes. For each case, the DLSA would give Rs500 to these volunteers, officials said.
