KOLKATA: Actor-turned-author   has reacted to the   over the certification of a   titled ‘The Argumentative Indian’. On Tuesday, the examining committee of the Kolkata office of the Central Board of Film Certification had approved the documentary for ‘U’ certification with “some amendments”.

 According to the director, he was asked to beep words like “cow”, “Gujarat”, “Hindu India” and “Hindutva view of India” from the documentary film revolving around conversations between Sen and Kaushik Basu, chief economic adviser in the UPA-2 regime. This immediately led to a debate over freedom of expression in this country. 
 
 Nandana, who was present at Monday’s screening of the documentary, called it an ‘absurd’ controversy. Said Nandana, “Absurd is the right word. It’s laughable, really, and rather embarrassing for the censor board I think. They look so foolish and insecure, don’t they?”
