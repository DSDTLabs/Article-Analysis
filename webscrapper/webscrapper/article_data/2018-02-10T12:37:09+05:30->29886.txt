Actor   is making a comeback to small screen after a decade and will star in a new series "Camping".

 The series is based on the UK show by the same name and written by   and Jenni Konner, reported an American trade magazine.
 
 The series has an eight-episode order and both Dunham and Konner are executive producing it.
 
  
  
 It follows a group of people as they come together to celebrate  's husband Walt's 45th birthday over a weekend spent back in nature, before it becomes a weekend of tested marriages and woman-on-woman crime.
 
 Garner will play the role of Kathryn Siddell-Bauers, which has been described as "messy, tough and provocative and really really fun".
 
 "We love Jennifer's restraint and comedic timing, and we cant wait for the warmth and intelligence she'll bring to our central character, Kathryn.
 
 It's truly a dream to have her first on our call sheet. Now we just have to write her some stunts," said Denhum and Konner.
 
 This will be television outing for Garner ever since her Emmy-nominated run as CIA agent   on "Alias", which aired from 2001 to 2006.
