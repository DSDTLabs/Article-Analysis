Mumbai: There's no such thing as a free lunch, leave alone a free car. A 32- year-old woman working for a hospital in south Mumbai learnt this the hard way recently. 

 The woman, who had received a courier about being the lucky winner of a   on an online portal, ended up losing Rs 60,500. The police said this is the latest trick in the fraudster's book. 
 
 A day after she received the courier, the woman got a call from a person who identified himself as   and claimed to be from the shopping portal. He asked for personal details to get the car registered in her name and asked her to deposit cash in one bank account for insurance and transportation fees, said a police officer. "To her, it seemed so genuine that she deposited the cash," he said.
 
 She was left disillusioned after she failed to get delivery of the car. She contacted the portal's office only to learn that they had not come up with any such scheme nor was any Rajesh Gupta working with them, said the officer.
 
 A case of cheating has been registered at the cyber crime police station.
