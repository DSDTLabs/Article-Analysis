MUMBAI: Around 12.25am Sunday, the remains of 5 helicopter crash victims were brought to   mortuary in   for autopsy. The corpses arrived from   located 1km away which is where the deaths were registered.

 Two ambulances and an undertaker van drove in to the mortuary by 12.30am. Attendants unloaded the bodies onto stretchers after the posse of mediapersons who trailed these vehicles were herded out by police.
 
 In a sign of the gravity of the accident, the body bags were folded in small blue plastic sheets unlike usual sized corpses, perhaps because the remains were in fragments.
 
 Mortuary officials say a delay was caused because   registered the deaths at Nanavati Hospital with which it has an official tie up. If the bodies had come straight to   the process would have been expedited. However police pointed out that the   likely did not wish to break protocol and invite unwanted criticism afterwards.
 
 The relatives of some of the victims entered the mortuary from another entrance to avoid the media. They huddled close to ONGC officials and declined comment.
