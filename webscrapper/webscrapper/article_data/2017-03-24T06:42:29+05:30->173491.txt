MUMBAI: An airline employee, whose car ran over a puppy at a Thane   last week, was arrested and released on bail by a Thane court. Police had lodged a case after   of the incident went viral. 

 Sunil Lokhande, DCP Zo ne-5, said, “Atul Ghangurde was arrested the day after the offence was registered at Vartak Nagar police station. He was produced in the magistrate court, which released him on bail.“ Ganghurde has denied it was a deliberate act. “I won't deny I was in the car but it was entirely accidental,“ he said, clai ming “personal vendetta“ had prompted some society members to frame him.
 
 Praveen Yabaji, a resident of the complex, had alleged Ghangurde was aware of the dog ahead of him. Ghangurde told TOI, “There was no possibility of seeing the dog from a distance. The spot has a left turn and then an immediate right turn, which makes it impossible to see from a distance.Yabaji is using footage to settle enmity.“ He disputed claims by “dog lovers“ in the society of taking care of dogs, saying another puppy was trampled by a car. “Was it then not their duty to shift puppies to a safer spot?“
