CHENNAI: In a first, the city traffic police have registered a case against a woman whose son, a minor, lost his life in a road accident in   late on Wednesday riding a two-wheeler owned by her.

 In an effort to bring down the number of accidents caused by minor riders and to act as a deterrent, the traffic police late last month hit upon the idea of penalising the parents of such riders and have now implemented it. In Hyderabad last month, the traffic police had conducted a massive crackdown against underage riders and sent at least 10 parents to jail for a day for allowing their children to drive vehicles.
 
 Akash*, a Class XI student who did not possess a licence and was not wearing a helmet, was taking a classmate, a girl, to a tuition centre on a   200 CC when he braked suddenly, lost control and smashed into a pedestrian on   before falling down.
 
 A few residents of the area and some passersby alerted the police personnel and called the 108 ambulance service. While  , who was rushed to   and Hospital before being shifted to a corporate hospital, died the same night, the pedestrian he smashed into and his classmate who was riding pillion escaped with injuries.
 
 The Tirumangalam traffic police investigation wing registered a case under Section 304 (a) (death caused due to negligent driving) against Akash and closed it after his death. His mother Meena Venkatesh, 40, the owner of the bike, was booked for allowing her son to ride it despite knowing that he didn’t possess a licence. She was booked under Section 5 read with Section 180 of the Motor Vehicles Act. “We have not arrested   as she has to perform the last rites for her son,” said a police officer. (*name changed)
