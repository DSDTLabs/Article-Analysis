AHMEDABAD: A pile of plastic water bottles and disposable dishes, cups and other litter lying here and there is not an uncommon sight at garba venues across the city. 

 However, this time around, city-based Centre for Environment Education (CEE) is pushing for a green and litter-free  . As part of their joint initiative with Adani Foundation, Swachhagraha, CEE has tied up with a number of venues and educational institutions to prevent and manage litter at the venues.
 
 Sharing more about the initiative, Madhavi Joshi, senior programme director, CEE, said, “The idea is to bring about a behavioural change among people and we’ve taken Navratri as one such platform. Through this campaign, we aim to influence and engage young people in the Swachhagraha movement to keep our garba venues clean.”
 
 Youngsters will not just avoid littering but even prevent others from littering. In fact, a set of guidelines formulated by CEE has also been circulated among venues and institutes.
 
 As part of Swachhagraha, CEE has affiliated with a number of educational institutes, including   (NID), HL College of Commerce, St Kabir School, HB Kapadia School and GLS, in addition to city-based Karnavati Club and even a few housing societies.
 
 “We have also affiliated with the sheri garba that is organized at Dhal ni Pol. Apart from the organizers, even pol residents will be participating in ensuring that there is no litter in and around the premises,” added Madhavi.
 
 CEE has also formulated a set of guidelines for organizers.
