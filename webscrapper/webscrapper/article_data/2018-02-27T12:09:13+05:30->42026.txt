PANAJI: Revolutionary Goans, an organisation of activists, on Monday objected to   and deputy speaker Michael Lobo’s reported proposal to grant SC/ST status to the Banjara community in Goa. Activist   demanded an apology from Lobo, saying that Goa’s own Dhangar community had yet to obtain SC/ST status.

 Almeida said that Lobo is working for the   and other migrant communities with the sole intention of creating his vote bank of migrants. Four other activists condemned Lobo’s statements and questioned why Goa’s MLAs were not giving the Dhangar community SC/ST status. They said that if the state government made any move to grant reservation or SC/ST status for the banjara community, there will be strong protests. 
 
 “Reservation cannot be more than 50%. If reservation is given for Banjaras, then we will have to reduce reservation for SC/STs and OBCs in Goa,” said said Parshuram Sourlekar.
