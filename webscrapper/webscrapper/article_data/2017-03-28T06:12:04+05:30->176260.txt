AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court Advocates’ Association (GHAA) has asked the Chief Justice of India why there is no judge from Gujarat HC appointed as chief justice (CJ) of any high court or as a judge in the  .

 In a letter, GHAA president   has termed the act of not elevating two senior judges of Gujarat to the post of CJ -- Justice Jayant Patel, currently serving in Karnataka HC, and Justice  , presently in Gujarat HC -- without any lawful reason, as “shocking”. 
 
 Pandya has stated, “At present there is no one representing the state of Gujarat as CJ in any high court and in the SC… It is an unwritten convention that while making appointments to the post of CJ of high courts and as a judge of the SC, this factor is invariably kept in mind.” 
 
 He has urged the CJI and the collegium to appoint Gujarat HC judges in these positions to give adequate representation to judicial officers from Gujarat.
 
 Advocate Pandya has also requested speedy appointment to the 21 vacant posts in Gujarat HC. He has also requested speeding up of the process of elevation of advocates and judicial officers to the post of HC judge. 
 
 He cited an example of senior counsel  , who was considered for the post of an HC judge, but due to inordinate delay, he himself withdrew his candidature saying that he was not interested in becoming high court judge. 
 
 The GHAA president has urged quick decision be taken in the matter of another lawyer   for placement as HC judge, because his files have been pending for long.
