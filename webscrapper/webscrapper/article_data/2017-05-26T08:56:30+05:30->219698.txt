RANCHI: The effort to organise a public meeting marking 50-years of farmers' revolution of Naxalbari, West Bengal by social activists was foiled by the district administration in the capital city on Thursday. 

 The office of the sub divisional officer (SDO) issued a receipt of the letter seeking permission for peaceful assembly on high tension ground near Namkom. However, the local police and CRPF dispersed the gathering claiming that there was no permission.
 
 One of the members of the organising committee,   said since the administration did not refuse them permission, thousands of people gathered in Ranchi from across the state, but were forcefully removed by the administration. He also added, "Farmers and labourers who were eager to join the public meeting faced hardships because of summer heat and the sudden order of policemen to vacate the ground." 
 
 Another member of the committee,   said that the Naxalbari uprising should not be mixed with Maoist violence. "The Naxalbari movement was a peasant and labour class movement which was successfully spread across the country despite being crushed by the state. It made the farmers and labourers aware of their democratic rights," he said. 
 
 Turi said the organisers planned a peaceful gathering to discuss about some of the policies of the state government which will exploit the farmers and poor tribal in future, while showing a copy of the letter submitted to the SDO's office on May 2. "Amendments to Chhotanagpur Tenancy and Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act will deprive the tribals from their right over land which will then reduce them to daily wage labourers instead of being farmers," he said. 
 
 Convener of the committee,   said the public meetings are scheduled in   on June 7, in Dhanbad on June 15, in Ramgarh on June 20, in Bokaro on June 28 and in Giridih on August 20.
