JAIPUR: In its rush for implementing the   project,   has failed to address several basic problems faced by residents.   is one such problem which is increasing day-by-day. 

 More than 70 complaints about stray   are registered every month at the   call centre. However, the civic body has neither the infrastructure nor any plans to address the problem. 
 
 Ward number 49 councillor Mohan Meena said, “Stray dogs in our ward have not only turned ferocious, but have started killing cattle. In Badli Waali Dhani area and Kho Nagoriyan, packs of 15-20 dogs entered a house and killed over five goats. There is a government school in the area and dogs pose threat to small kids.”
 
 Ratan Meena, a resident of the locality said, “JMC is carrying out a drive against illegal dairies and catching animals tethered inside houses. However, it has no infrastructure to catch stray dogs on roads.” 
 
 In the absence of an effective sterilization programme, JMC is struggling to control the increasing number of stray dogs.
 
 According to JMC officials, dog population in Jaipur is around 25,500. However, the civic body has not invited tenders for sterilization and administering anti-rabies injections over the past two years.
 
 “On Monday, we finalised the tender of one company that expressed interest to sterilize dogs and administer anti-rabies injections. The proposal would be tabled before city mayor for final approval,” a senior JMC official said.
 
 While JMC has turned a blind eye towards dog menace, NGO Help in Suffering (HIS) is working to make Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme successful.
 
 In 2017, HIS sterilised and vaccinated 3,985 street dogs. It further vaccinated 4,364 street dogs against rabies.
 
 “We have been sterilising and vaccinating approximately 3,500 street dogs each year for past several years. As per March 2017 survey, 73% bitches were vaccinated and sterilised and 70% dogs were vaccinated against rabies,” a veterinary surgeon at HIS said.
