 "Many college students are staging protests demanding the conduct of jallikattu this year. The students’ protests have been happening across the state for the last 15 days. These look like the 1965   in the state," Stalin told the students. New College is Stalin’s alma mater. 
 
 He said, “I request the Centre to promulgate an ordinance so that jallikattu can be held this year.”
 
  "I want the central and state governments to look into the protest by students. I hope the state will get permission to hold jallikattu. But if that does not happen, I will consult DMK president M Karunanidhi and general secretary K Anbazhagan and take a decision whether to include students in the DMK protest against central and state governments on this issue," Stalin said.
 
 The DMK will hold a state-wide protest on Friday on the jallikattu issue.
