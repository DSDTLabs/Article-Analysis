Nagpur: The city traffic police have penalized nearly 1,558 motorists on Republic Day for various violations.  Around 879 were nabbed for riding motorcycles without helmets, 109 motorists were caught for riding triple seat and six groups were booked for staging motorcycle rallies with the Tricolour. Around 60 drivers/riders were booked for drunk driving too. Data released by the traffic department shows that at 625, zone-III (North) had the most violators. Zone-II (South) followed with 323, zone-IV (East) with 256, zone-V (Indora) and zone-I (MIDC) 155 each. The zone-II of traffic police led by senior PI Jayesh Bhandarkar found most violators on the Telangkhedi promenade which is a meeting point for all celebrations in the city. “We have no problems with celebrations. Waving of flags outside the window and mounted on one’s car is dangerous for all motorists. Therefore, we took action,” said Bhandarkar.  However, youngsters have justified their way of celebrations. “We have no other platform to express ourselves on such occasions. We drive cars, motorbikes waving national flags to do so,” said a group of youngsters. Secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers Association Tejinder Singh Renu said: “Rise in hooliganism on bikes, violating practically majority of Vehicle Rules, by youths on Republic Day is extremely unfortunate. Shouting and waving national flag by riding rashly doesn’t reflect any patriotism. Lack of police action is one of the causes for brazen violations as we can easily mark strategic roads where such activities are high and target that areas with cameras. Cops need to deliver results so that the key of fear works.”
