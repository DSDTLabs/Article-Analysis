 will dub her upcoming film 'Mom' in Tamil,   and   apart from its original language,  . Interestingly, the actress, who started out as a child artiste, has been a part of movies in all the aforementioned languages for five decades now. And given the landmark point that   comes at in her career, she has decided to dub it in her voice in all the four languages. 

 A source associated with the project reveals, “Sridevi has recently started dubbing and she insisted on doing it because she started as a child actor in the southern languages and achieved stardom in Hindi. So, she was keen to mouth her lines in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam apart from Hindi.” 
 As they say, language is no bar in the movies.
