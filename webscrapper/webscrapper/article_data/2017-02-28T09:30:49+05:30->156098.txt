MADURAI: A medical lab owner from   district has been   for buying a six-month-old child from Avaniyapuram in Madurai city. Four more people, including two women, were also arrested for brokering the sales. Based on a complaint from the child’s mother, a case was registered with Avaniyapuram police station. Police are searching for two more people involved in the incident.

 The complainant was identified as P Kanaga from Kilaneri village near Nagamalai in Madurai district. Police said Kanaga had given birth to a male child six months ago. The 34-year-old woman has a daughter. Her husband Palani Kumar had deserted his wife long before the second child was born. With her husband gone, Kanaga found it difficult to raise two children.
 
 According to police, Kanaga had told A Rebecal, her neighbour who worked in a church, about her financial struggle. The latter suggested that she give up her child. Kanaga was open to the idea and thus Rebecal decided to make some money by selling the baby. 
 
 Rebecal got in touch with N Ramkumar from CAS Sanger who in turn, with the help of some middle men, got in touch with Mani from Machavadi in Pudukkottai district. Mani, who runs a medical lab, is married and has a 12-year-old daughter. He was very keen on having a son and thus was willing to pay Rs 2.5lakh for Kanaga’s son.
 
 Police said the money was shared among the middlemen. When Kanaga learned about the sales, she entered into a dispute with Rebecal. She approached Avaniyapuram police station on Sunday and filed a case. Police have arrested Rebecal, 57, from Sambakudi, Ramkumar, 33,  , 42, from Avaniyapuram and Indirani. Mani was also arrested. Police said they are searching for two more people, Janikiraman and  , in connection with the incident.
