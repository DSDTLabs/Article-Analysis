INDORE: A   on Monday claimed to have successfully performed a rare autologous   to save a 37-years-old suffering from   despite lack of proper instruments. 

 "For the transplant, preservation is required to keep the stem cells at -140 degree Celsius for six days. As this facility is not available in the city, some technical changes were adopted and the cells were preserved at 4 degree Celsius temperature for three days," said the cancer specialist Dr Vinay Bohra.
 
 He added that the stem cell creates identical cell. The healthy stem cells were then transplanted into the patient Pawan Vaishnav after the treatment of blood cancer patients with chemotherapy. This process went on for three weeks. Though the doctor had confidence to get the desired results in performing the transplant, the patient's financial condition created a problem in carrying on with the treatment.
 
 To this, Pawan's relatives and friends began fundraising for   through social media.
 
 "The cost for performing the transplant is around Rs 5-6 lakh. The technique used by us however not only saved the patient but also helped in saving around Rs 4 lakh as the entire cost of the treatment was Rs 1.90 lakh," said Bohra.
