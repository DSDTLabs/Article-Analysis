PATNA:   seized more than 900 cartons of   from a private building at   in the town on Saturday. 

 Altogether 9,780 bottles containing around 7,335 litres of beer were seized from the house of one Pappu Rai of Raghopur in Vaishali district. The seizure is one of the largest made in Patna district since prohibition imposed in state on April 5 last year.
 
 The police had to hire four pickup vans and three tractors to carry the consignment to the Beur police station.
 
 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said police conducted the raid after receiving a tip-off. “We suspect the liquor was for use during the urban local body elections scheduled to take place in Patna on June 4,” the SSP said.
 
 “The seized consignment belonged to  , who is contesting the   election from ward number 13 in Gardanibagh area,” he added.
 
 Sources said Pappu, after his arrest, told the police that Sanjay had taken the house on rent almost six months back. Surprisingly, the seized beer was manufactured in Bihar in February 2016, before prohibition.
 
 “Sanjay used to own a beer bar on NH-30 in Beur area. The consignment seized on Saturday was purchased by him before April last year,” said a senior police official preferring anonymity. He said Sanjay might have more stock of beer and liquor which he sold on black market after prohibition. Police failed to contact Sanjay after the seizure, he added.
 
 The SSP, within hours of the seizure, initiated the legal process for destroying the consignment as police have no secure space to store the beer.
