HYDERABAD: Detectives of the   (AIU) of the customs department apprehended a couple at the   on Tuesday and seized 1.1kg gold from their possession. 

 Acting on a specific alert, the AIU detectives intercepted the couple who landed at the RGI Airport on an   (AI 966) from Jeddah on Tuesday.
 
 The couple was pulled aside for frisking and customs officials found four gold bars and two gold kadas wrapped around the feet of the two offenders. The gold items were held in place by tape.
 
 "The duo strapped the gold items with tape then wore socks and shoes. They were told by smugglers in Jeddah that since many shoes contain metal objects, beeps from metal detectors would not be taken seriously by customs officials at the airports," a customs department official said.
 
 The value of the seized gold is 32.6 lakh, customs officials said. The couple is from Hyderabad and detectives found out that they had travelled back and forth from Hyderabad to Jeddah a few times, probably on smuggling missions. "We are trying to find out who the handlers of the couple are," said a customs official. 
 
 While officials have been apprehending smugglers, handlers overseeing operating are seldom caught. Officials say that it is very difficult to nab the main operatives of smuggling rackets as they do not directly communicate with the carriers.
