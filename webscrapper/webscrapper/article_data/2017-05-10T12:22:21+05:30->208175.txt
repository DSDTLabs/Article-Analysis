Mihika and Bala finally reach the mehendi function with Aaliya's lehenga. Ishita gifts it to Aaliya. Everyone loves it. Shagun opens the box and finds designers card in it. She guesses it is from an expensive showroom and gets angry at Ishita.
 
  She immediately calls her in a different room and confronts her. Shagun tells her that she always acts oversmart. She tells Ishita that even Shagun had the same idea but Ishita got rigged and went for the replica. And then went to the designer secretly. Ishita is confused. Family members join them.
  
  Mihika and Bala are speechless and Shagun continues calling Ishita a fraud. Mihika and Bala tell everyone that the lehnga is from the designer store as they coudn't find a good one from any regular shop and it is Aaliya's special day, so they didn't want to mess it. Shagun calls all of this a drama.
  
  
 
  
  Next morning, Ishita sees Roshni prepare breakfast for everyone. She then sees Roshni's mehndi which came out very dark and tells that her husband loves her a lot. She then apologises for saying this.
  
  Aaliya wakes up and sees her mehndi not so dark. She gets upset and calls Adi and fights with him. She tells him that she has a feeling that he loves someone else.
  
  Adi gets tensed thinking that Aaliya has got to know about his marriage with Roshni.
