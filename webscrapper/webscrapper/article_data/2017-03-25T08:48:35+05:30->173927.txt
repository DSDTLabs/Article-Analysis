JAIPUR: From April 1, commuters who use the Jaipur   (Mansarovar to Chandpole) will have to pay higher fares. The proposal to increase the fare was approved in the 31st board meeting of the   (JMRC) on Friday.

 The minimum hike by JMRC is Rs 1 and maximum Rs 3. There are nine stations on the 9.25 km stretched Metro corridor. During the peak hours, from the starting point, the fare for next two stations has increased to Rs 11 from Rs 10. For the next three stations the fare during peak hours would be Rs 17, which is Rs 15 at present. Passengers who would be travelling beyond the fifth station would now have to pay Rs 23 instead of Rs 20.
 
 JMRC has also revised fares for those riding in non-peak hours. One rupee has been increased for first two stations, so now commuters have to pay Rs 6. Similarly, for the next three stations the fare during non-peak hour would be Rs 11. Commuters who would be travelling beyond the fifth station would now have to pay Rs 17 during non-peak hours. A senior JMRC official informed TOI, “The revised fair will be applicable till next two years, April 1, 2019. As JMRC provides 15% discount to its smart card users, we promote that all the commuters should use the facility.”
 
 As per the policy, the JMRC has mandate to increase the fare in every two years. The increased fares directly depend on increase of per unit purchase of electricity, dearness allowance rate of state government employees and monthly all India consumer price index for industrial workers.
 
 A senior JMRC official said, “On January 2015, the JMRC was purchasing electricity from   at Rs 6.25 per unit. Now, it has been increased to Rs 7.30 per unit. Similarly, consumer price index has been increased by nearly15% . The JMRC has an existing formula to calculate the increase in price. The rates are revised on that basis.”
