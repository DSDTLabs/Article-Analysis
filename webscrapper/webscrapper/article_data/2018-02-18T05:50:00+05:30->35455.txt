KOCHI: As per the statements collected by the   (F&B) department probing into the   at the   ( ) limited, a minor blast had happened just before the major explosion in which five persons died.

 As per the statement given to the F&B department by a fire safety official who had a lucky escape, a sound of a minor blast was heard from the ballast tank just before the major explosion.
 
 
 F&B sources said that the precise location of the major explosion was the third deck from the top just above the ballast tank.
 
 The compartment walls of the third deck were displaced by the impact of the explosion. Also, many doors in the deck had been displaced. The effect of the explosion was visible inside the ballast tank as well. However, the bodies were found on the deck.
 
 The F&B has found two hoses from the deck where the explosion happened. Officers said that one of the hoses had an open end while a brass torch was attached to the other end.
 
 “We suspect that the explosion happened when the workers tried to light up the torch of the gas cutter. However, there is no evidence to prove the exact reason which led to the explosion,” said an F&B official.
 
 According to sources in the department, the investigation is now focused on finding the exact reason for the spark that caused the explosion. There are three possible causes — from an electric circuit, from mobile phone use or through operation of a gas cutter.
 
 “From what we know, the gas leak was communicated using mobile phones. We need to confirm whether this led to the spark causing the blast,” said an official.
 
 Experts said that the reason for one person suffering 40% burns could be the uneven concentration of the gas.
