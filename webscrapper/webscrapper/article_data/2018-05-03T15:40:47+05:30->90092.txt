The book follows journalist Mrinalini Rao who visits Chittorgarh to dig deep into the life of Padmavati. She comes across Uma, a local village girl with a thorough understanding of the queen's autobiography. Sutapa employs this technique successfully in retelling Padmavati's story from her own perspective. The novel opens with a vivid description of Padmini waiting for the Jauhar fire to engulf her, along with her vigour and virtue. Padmini narrates every phase of her life that leads up to her marriage to Ratan Singh and her continuous efforts to prove her allegiance to the Rajput Kingdom. Sutapa's  is a powerful narrative oscillating between the conversation of Uma, Mrinalini and Rani Padmini's own account.
