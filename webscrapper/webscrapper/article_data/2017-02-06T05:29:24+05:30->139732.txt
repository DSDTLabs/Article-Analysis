NEW DELHI: The proposal to impose a ban on all   transactions beyond Rs 3 lakh may also help the government track high-value deals involving agricultural products in the mandi and keep tabs on bogus farm income claims.

 “The idea is to track all cash transactions across the economy. While there is no plan to tax farm income, this will certainly help in discouraging large cash transactions in mandis, without affecting small farmers,” said a senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.
 
 A tax consultant with a leading global firm said that the move would impact all those who claim large farm income and do not pay tax. “If I claim Rs 10-15 lakh as agricultural income, the department can come back and ask me to show how I received the payment,” the consultant said.
 
 In the Budget, finance minister Arun Jaitley had proposed to bar all cash transactions above Rs 3 lakh, following a recommendation by the SC-appointed Special Investigation Team on  . The ban applies to single transactions as well as to the amount paid to an individual in a day. Starting April, failure to comply with the restriction will attract penalty equal to the amount paid in cash, the Finance Bill has proposed.
 
 So, the receiver will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5 lakh if he accepts cash payment of Rs 5 lakh. The government has proposed several amendments to the I-T Act to clamp down on cash transactions, including withdrawal of benefits for businesses for cash payments beyond Rs 10,000.
 
 Tax consultants, however, said that individuals would split the transactions to avoid being caught. A day after the Budget, revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia had told TOI in an interview that the government will create a mechanism for people to come forward and disclose payments of over Rs 3 lakh.
