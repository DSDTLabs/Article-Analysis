JAIPUR: A 37-year-old   who terrorized a family for seven years by fueling paranoia about evil spirits and duped them of Rs 1.59 crore was finally arrested.

 The special operations group (SOG) which had arrested   on Saturday, suspected that there could be other conspirators and even victims involved in the horrifying crime. “The family lived through seven years of inexplicable trauma and suffering. It’s the serious nature of offence due to which we took up the investigation,” said additional DGP (SOG, ATS)  , adding that the teams are investigating if he had other aides too.
 
 The SOG, however, is currently investigating Balani’s role in the particular complaint that was given by the family a few days ago. According to SOG IG Dinesh MN,   victimized the family by instilling fear of an impending death in the family and evil spirits.
 
 The family was made to cough up a total of Rs 1.59 crore, including jewelry. In their complaint to the SOG, the family had alleged that the accused had also sexually exploited the daughter and her mother on pretext of warding off evils spirits.
 
 “He took the money on pretext of organizing rituals at different cities. The family continued to cough up large sums of money for these rituals,” an official said.
 
 The initial investigation indicates that Balani had come into the family’s contact through a friend of their daughter, “She herself was being blackmailed and threatened by two other accused. She was already under fear and was ready to believe Balani who offered help,” said an official, adding that the family finally decided to end their silence and approached them.
