THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state assembly on Tuesday praised the compassion shown by a woman lawyer who took efforts to take an accident victim lying unattended on the road to a hospital in Kochi.

 Replying to a submission by Hibi Eden, MLA, chief minister Pinarayi   said more people should imitate the kind of compassion shown by Ranjani R, the lawyer.
 
 He requested them to hold humanitarian values high and act instead of remaining as mute spectators. The fear of ensuing legal tangles often prevent people from helping hapless victims, he added. “But such people will have legal protection,” the chief minister said. He said the government is putting in place a programme to ensure that those who are injured in road accidents get free treatment for the first 48 hours. He said people should not be denied medical assistance just because they do not have money. Once the project kicks off, the hospitals would be asked not to demand any kind of payment from the patient or their bystanders.
 
 Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also lauded the efforts of Ranjani. Ranjani, practising in the HC, took the initiative to take an accident victim to the hospital while the others remained as mute spectators. The victim had fallen down from the third floor of a lodge. The incident happened at the   on Saturday.
