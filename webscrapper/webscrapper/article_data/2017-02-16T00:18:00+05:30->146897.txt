BHOPAL: At times words fall short to describe a beautiful piece of art. Yusuf’s paintings however speak for themselves. One of the   in the country, he can work wonders with his paint brush and needle.

 To have a look at his work, you can visit the 7th International Biennial of Contemporary Indian Art Exhibition at   where three of his paintings are on display.
 
 With his trademark element ‘the line’ Yusuf has the gift of expressing emotion and art, love and colour on a cloth or a canvas with a stroke of a brush or the turn of the needle.
 
 He refuses to give titles to his works as he believes that it takes away the freedom from the viewer’s vision. “I usually avoid giving names to my works as I firmly believe that it puts a limit not only on my work but also on viewer’s vision. If I call my work ‘Sky’ the spectator will view it only as sky. My concept is to give freedom to people to view my work,” says Yusuf while interacting with TOI.
 
 He says his paintings have musical connotations, they should be felt. The paintings dig into the meditative world as the many lines flow, twist, run, break and calm. His work has been acknowledged for rich visual rendering and for the magic he creates through his rhythmic lines.
 
 Jagdish Swaminathan, a leading artist of his time had once written about Yusuf, “There is no one like him who can understand the meaning, magic and value of line.”   is instrumental in establishing the Bharat Bhavan.
 
 Born in Gwalior in 1952, Yusuf (65) graduated in fine arts and sculpture from the Gwalior Art College. Since he was very close to his mentor J Swaminathan, he moved to Bhopal and spent his time assisting him in founding Bharat Bhavan which is now a hub of art and culture in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 A key figure in the art movement in Bhopal, Yusuf is a celebrated guide and mentor who is known for his never-ending support to aspiring and young artists all over India especially young artists based in Madhya Pradesh.
