SANGRUR: A re-investigation ordered into the death of a local youth confirmed that he had actually been murdered for family's honour in   district after he was allegedly seen stalking a local girl. The police had earlier filed a case of accidental death. 

 Interacting with newspersons, Sangrur SP (detective) H S Hundal said the Bhawanigarh police had found the body of a youth on   road in September 2017, who was later identified as Yudhvir Singh. Initially, it looked like a case of accidental death but the cops got a tip-off that he had been murdered for stalking the daughter of a farmer of   village. 
 
 The SP said following this the case was reopened and investigations handed over to the crime investigating agency (CIA) of the district police. During the investigations, it emerged that Yudhvir had been stalking the daughter of   of Nurpur. 
 
 On September 30 last year, he went to Jaswant's house in an attempt to interact with his daughter, but was spotted by the former. Enraged over seeing Yudhvir at his house, Jaswant, along with two of his employees   and  , thrashed the youth and he died. In an attempt to hide their crime, the three took the body and left it on Nabha Channo road at a secluded place to make it look like an accident.
 
 Hundal said following the revelations, the cops incorporated Section 302 (murder) of the IPC to the FIR that had been earlier registered as an accidental death and arrested the three.
