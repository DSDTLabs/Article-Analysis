Bengaluru has a reason to fly high.The city has emerged as a top training hub for civil helicopter pilots, from India and abroad as well.Helicopter operators from the neighbouring countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Africa have been sending their pilots to the city-based   to Train by Simulation Flying (HATSOFF).

 HATSOFF, which is promoted by state-owned aerospace major HAL, along with CAE, Canada, was the first to offer Level-D simulator training to helicopter pilots in south-east Asia. “Apart from imparting simulator training to our military pilots, we have been training clients from Australia, Japan and Canada. The training is highly competitive and the visual data base we have is better than that abroad,“ said  , CEO, HATSOFF.
 
 Krishna did not specify exactly how cheap it was to train in Bengaluru as compared to competitors, but mentioned that the cost of travel and lodging was cheaper here. The per-hour cost of training on a full mission simulator, world over, is generally below 55 per cent of per hour cost of flying on an actual helicopter. The professional competence of the crew is also said to have improved by an order of magnitude at 42 per cent to 55 per cent cost.
 
 The simulation training is a recurring one in which pilots are trained to handle critical emergencies, fly in hills, offshore, search and rescue, emergency medical, rooftop and desert operations.
 
 “We have one of the largest database of all kind of helipads, terrains and conditions. The training is quite taxing as each pilot undergoes five to eight hours of training which is spread over one of two sessions,“ he added.
