LUCKNOW:  , Samajwadi Party’s spokesperson and its face on news channel, resigned from all the party posts on Sunday. Bhatia was also the national president of SP’s lawyers wing. Taking to TOI, he said he had sent his resignation to party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav and national president Akhilesh Yadav. 

 “The failure on the SP and its government in the state to protect the interest of the lawyer community which has been backing the party in a consilidated manner, had prompted me to take the step,” said Bhatia, who is also a Supreme Court lawyer and at present the general secretary of Supreme Court Bar Association. He is son of late  , UP’s former advocate general and also a Rajya Sabha member. He was very close to Mulayam.
 
 “This decision is firmly entrenched in my principles of democracy and socialism.
