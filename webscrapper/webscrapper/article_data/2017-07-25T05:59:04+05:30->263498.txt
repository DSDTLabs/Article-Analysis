JAIPUR: The Jaipur police on Monday said they will probe the events leading to the death of 19-year-old Aditi Sanghi who died after falling from the terrace of a six-floor building in her university.

 On late Monday evening, Sunil Sanghi, the father of the victim, wrote a letter to Shipra Path police station stating that the family does not want any police probe into her death.
 
 However, the police station in-charge, Mukesh Choudhary, said the cops would indeed probe the events that led to Aditi’s death.
 
 “The father has claimed that he doesn’t want any inquiry. But, we will probe the case to check if there were any lapses in security. If we come across any lapses, a case would be filed against the persons responsible,” Choudhary told TOI.
 
 Disaster management experts have already maintained that Aditi’s death was a result of safety lapses. “Such type of sports must be carried out in proper manner with a safe distance between those who are standing for their turn and those who have already completed their turn,” a senior official of the state disaster relief force (SDRF) informed TOI.
 
 “The entire drill was conducted with scant regard for safety rules. Also, we don’t know if Sunil Sanghi is a certified instructor,” the official said.
 
 A probe by cops may bring out several safety lapses in the programme conducted by the college.
