KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress leader and the party's   district president  's comment on veteran poet   evoked a strong reaction from the city's literary circles. 

 
 Reacting to a poem by Ghosh, posted on his webpage, Mandal questioned the poet's right to doubt the development work carried out in the district. "We had so far known Tagore and Nazrul as poets. What kind of a poet are you? Can't you see the development?" said Mandal, while addressing a panchayat poll rally in Birbhum on Wednesday.
 
 Author and educationist   felt Mandal's comment was in bad taste. "He has exposed his ignorance by questioning Sankha Ghosh's status as a poet. Ghosh is a respected poet who is well known across the state and beyond. Mandal's comment shows he is unaware. Mandal has the right to counter what Ghosh has written. But he could have done that in a more dignified manner," said Sarkar.
 
 A poet can't be insulted like this, felt writer Abul Bashar. "Sankha Ghosh is like our guardian. His cultural leadership has been guiding the literary community for years. His poem is a protest against political violence and a call for real development. He has conveyed the message in a poetic language which, I am afraid, Mandal can't appreciate. He is within his rights to counter what Ghosh has said. But he should have done that in a civilized way," Bashar said, adding Mandal should withdraw his comment and apologize to Ghosh.
 
 Ghosh declined to comment.
