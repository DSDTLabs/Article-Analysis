New Delhi: A school principal and its  , who were found guilty of   and causing mental trauma to a class III student by stopping her from entering the classroom, on Tuesday moved applications seeking their release on probation. The court will now consider their   on July 22.

 The court had earlier observed the act of not allowing the child to sit in the classroom amounted to willful neglect.
 
 A source privy to the case said that the lawyers of the convicts moved their respective plea following which the court sought a report from the probation officer.
 
 The court, at the time of conviction, had observed, “The child cannot be thrown out at the whim and fancies of the school authorities.” Chief metropolitan magistrate Ankur Jain, therefore, held director Kavita Chandra and principal Romi Chawla of the Dwarka-based   guilty.
 
 In his complaint, father of the student Dr N Raghu ram alleged that his daughter was "ill-treated" and confined by the school management throughout school hours on April 24, 2012, in order to pressurise her guardians to withdraw her from the school.   alleged that the school's conduct was the result of the queries raised by the father about students' uniforms and accessories during the orientation programme.
 
 The school authorities, on the contrary, had claimed that the student was given a transfer certificate (TC) on April 23, 2012 on the request of her parents, however, instead of collecting the TC they sent their daughter to school the next day. The child was apparently "not feeling comfortable" after coming to school and since she was an asthma patient she was sent to infirmary , the authorities said. The school also requested her parents to pick her up and collect the TC.
