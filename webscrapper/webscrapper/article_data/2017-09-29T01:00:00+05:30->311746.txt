NAWADA: The state home department has suspended   services in Nawada district till September 30 following ugly scenes at communally sensitive Akbarpur in Rajauli sub-division on Wednesday night.

 Police sources said members of a minority community at Balia Bujurg village objected to blaring of patriotic songs by the majority community who were escorting the idol of Goddess Durga to Akbarpur from Fatehpur Mor, about 17km from Nawada town. “Soon tempers flared and it resulted in heavy stone pelting in which idol of Goddess Durga was damaged. In a retaliatory move, the Tazia was set ablaze, further worsening the communal divide,” said a police source.
 
 A police officer said anticipating that the image of the desecrated idol of the Goddess could go viral and further vitiate the communally charged scenario elsewhere, the state home department has suspended Internet services in the district on the appeal of DM Kaushal Kumar. “Internet services will resume in the district only after review of the situation,” the DM said. The move, however, has dampened the festive spirit in the district as people are not able to use social media sites to share their Puja joy with friends and relatives.
 
 Earlier, Internet services in the district were suspended in the district during Ram Navami festival in April this year after a policeman from minority community was injured in stone pelting near Hanuman temple, hardly a stone’s throw distance from the official residences of the district judge and the DM.
 
 Police sources said Akbarpur remained tense on Thursday despite Rajauli sub-divisional SDO Shambhu Pandey and SDPO Umesh Kumar doing their best to pacify the people from the majority community who are sitting on dharna on Akbarpur main road demanding arrest of the culprits responsible for desecration of the Durga idol.
