MANSA/BATHINDA:   in Bathinda and Mansa districts have accused the arhtiyas (commission agents) of pocketing 120g wheat by over-weighing each gunny bag which has 50 kg capacity, while measuring the grains in the mandis. They have also accused   (mandi board) officials of colluding with them.

 Farmers allege that at some purchase centres in Mansa, the commission agents were stating each 50kg capacity gunny bag as weighing 700g whereas its actual weight was 580g. The weight of gunny bag is deducted from wheat while weighing the produce. The commission agents were therefore getting 120g more wheat per bag which was worth Rs 2.
 
 At the purchase centre in Bhaini Bagha village, farmers detected the malpractice on Wednesday and made the commission agent calculate weight of each gunny bag at 600g to save farmers from being duped of 100g of wheat per bag.
 
 Mansa district mandi officer Darshan Kumar, who is also in-charge of Sangrur, confirmed that duping was detected at some purchase centres and recommendation had been made for suspension of the licence of an arhtiya in Bareta. He said another commission agent had been fined Rs 21,000 at Sunam for overweighing gunny bags.
 
 Ram Singh Bhaini Bagha, chief of Mansa unit of farmer organization BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) alleged, “We have received complaints that commission agents, with support from  , are calculating weight of bag at 700g instead of 580g. We raised objection with the commission agents and officials who had reached the purchase centre and fixed the weight of each bag at 600g. It is happening at more purchase centres. From Friday, we will start the move to check as many purchase centres as we can to save farmers from loot and call upon authorities to look into the matter.”
 
 Bathinda   ( ) Sakshi Sawheny said, “No such malpractice has come to the knowledge of the district administration. If any complaint is raised, strict action will be taken.”
