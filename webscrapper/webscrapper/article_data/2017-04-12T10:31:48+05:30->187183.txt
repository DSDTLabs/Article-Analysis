 Bhagwati then plotted a plan to extract the money from Dudi. Bhagwati, along with his six relatives who were all residents at Telephone Exchange Square, abducted Dudi from his place on April 2. “They brought Dudi to their room and badly assaulted him. Later, they even clicked pictures of him in the nude,” said senior PI SS Sankhe. He remained in their custody till the evening of April 3.
 
 After the incident, Dudi went to Rajasthan where he came to know that his obscene pictures have been shared on their community’s whatsapp group. He returned to Nagpur a couple of days ago. 
 
 On Monday, the accused again approached him and threatened to post those images on other groups too. Dudi, who was afraid of being defamed, then lodged a complaint at the Ajni police station.

The others have been identified as Hariram, Motilal, Devilal, Babulal Jangi and Purvaram Jaat. Their mobile instruments have been seized for further investigation.
