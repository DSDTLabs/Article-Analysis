KANNUR: The   alleged that the LDF governmentâ€™s decision to withdraw the case against the   for blockading former chief minister   is a fascist move, which is a mockery towards the rule of the law.

 The case was registered as a supplementary case with the main case of the attack on Oommen Chandy in Kannur town on October 27, 2013, in which he was injured on his head, and 114 people have been charged under 307 IPC (attempt to murder). That case is in the trial stage. However, this case under 353 IPC (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) is different from the main case and the charge is that the CPM leaders including P Jayarajan, MV Jayarajan and PK Sreemathi blockaded him when he came to inaugurate the concluding ceremony of the 43rd Kerala Police Annual Athletic Meet, said police.
 
 The case filed by the then police inspector of Alakkode was that these leaders deterred the police from discharge of their duty. However, after the government decision to withdraw the case, the complainant withdrew it, said police. This case has no connection with the original case of attack on Oommen Chandy, which has been registered under section 307 IPC, said the district government pleader B P Saseendran, who said the proceedings to begin the trial in that case are on.
 
 But the decision to withdraw the case is an example of the fascist approach of the Government which misused its power, said DCC president Satheesan Pacheni. He said this reminds the cell rule of the party when it was in power in 1957 and the people who value democracy will give a befitting answer to it.
