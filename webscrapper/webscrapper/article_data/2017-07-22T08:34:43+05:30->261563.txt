CHENNAI: It has been almost two years since   began efforts to get the city police to divert traffic from the New   Bridge (NRT bridge) to facilitate the laying of the third and fourth line from Chennai Beach to  , a key capacity-addition project for the city's suburban train network. 

 The police finally announced the diversion from this week-end. However, the move came only after an intervention from the Prime Minister's Office ( ), say railway officials.
 
 The 4.1km Beach-Korukkupet railway line quadrapuling is a 150 crore project announced at least half a decade ago. "PMO reviewed the project under the Pragati scheme two weeks ago and at a meeting, directed the state government to give the necessary support," said an official in the railway's construction wing. Under the scheme, PMO reviews the progress of crucial projects. Even a few weeks before this meeting, Chennai city police had not permitted the diversion, citing traffic flow issues. The project involved a crucial land transfer with the Chennai Port Trust as railways does not have any land on the eastern side of the existing two lines. This was completed and kept ready for around two years; work at Royapuram station, which is just under the NRT flyover had already begun. 
 
 However, the only bottleneck was two closely-placed pillars of the bridge which have to be removed to make room for the tracks and overhead electric lines. Railways will knock these pillars off and have already erected two other pillars with a wider span to make way for the tracks. The traffic diversion is needed to dismantle the pillars and re-construct a part of the bridge. The process will take around three months.
