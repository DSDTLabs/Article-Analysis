BHOPAL: Almost a year after RSS supremo  's outburst in Panaji that English education is not sufficient enough to teach humanitarian and patriotic values to children, parents' pressure seems to have changed the mind of the saffron organisation, at least in Madhya Pradesh. 

 The Sangh-run Saraswati Mandirs have started laying special emphasis on spoken English. In December 2015, after unveiling a statue of RSS founder KB Hedgewar in Panaji, Bhagwat had referred to English-medium schools and said that "such schools" were not needed. But the organisation seems Parents want their children to be well versed in
 
 English. Where ever teachers are available we have started English spoken classes in   mandirs across the state. We are making efforts to start such classes in as many schools as possible, said head of   .Madhya Bharat region  . Talking to TOI, he said, " We have no reservation with the language and English was one of the subjects that was being taught. English teachers have been directed to talk only in English during the period to
 
 create an atmosphere for the language in the school." Bahvsar did not specify when did the Vidhya Bharti's chain of educational institutions started teaching spoken English. " However," he said, " there are over 2000 Saraswati Shishu mandirs in Madhya Pradesh and we have started holding spoken English classes in higher secondary and High schools of Saraswati mandirs for the past some time."
 
 The school is also holding training programmes for the English language teachers. " You know there is dearth of good teachers. And you need to have command over the language to impart training to the students. "
