CHENNAI: Residents of   near   blocked at least 15 trucks and an earth mover after finding them mining sand on the banks of the Cooum on Saturday. The drivers of the trucks were smuggling sand for the last four days claiming they were working for the Defence Expo, residents told police.

 “We asked them to clear the vehicles so that we can have the trucks impounded,” said a policeman at the spot. The trucks will remain at the spot overnight, he added. 
 
 The residents said the truck drivers told them they were taking soil from the banks to conduct tests for erecting pillars. Prakash, a resident of the area who plies an autorickshaw, said, “When I questioned a  , he showed a piece of paper mentioning the Defence Expo. We believed them initially.”
 
 Residents grew suspicious after finding that the banks of the river had been dug up to a depth of more than 100 feet. They also noticed that the trucks were operating only during the wee hours, especially after 3am.
 
 Although the residents asked the truck drivers to bring the contractors involved in the mining, no one turned up. The angered residents blocked the road accessed by the trucks by parking their vehicles in a zig-zag manner and informed the city police control room. However, only two policemen turned up and tried to negotiate with the residents to allow the blocked trucks to pass, said a resident.
 
 “Police personnel who came from the Aminjikarai police station threatened some of the residents who led the protests and asked them to clear the road to enable the trucks to leave the place,” said another resident. Police personnel, however, told TOI that they sought the cooperation of residents.
