JAIPUR: She wrote her first book, Love@Facebook, when she was only 19, and has in seven years hence churned out nine more, the last being 'Every Time It Rains'. Not surprisingly, the young and best-selling author of romance novels,  , has written most of her novels in just two weeks! 

  On Wednesday, the author from Patna spoke at the Write  , moderated by Aakriti Periwal, at ITC Rajputana. Being one of the country's leading writers and one so young, the curiosity about the secret behind Nikita's large body of work was only natural. Contrary to writers who take years to finish one work, Nikita prefers to write at one go, and does not stop until she's done. Prior to the actual writing, she spends months planning character outlines so that she has all the details down before she starts. 
 
  Commenting on what sets Nikita's work apart from the rest of India's romance novelists, Aakriti said it was her strong female characters. Admitting it, the author said it came naturally to her as she has been surrounded by strong women all her life and drew from their strength. 
 
  She emphasised that women were not as gullible as romance fiction traditionally portrayed them, showing us why young, realistic voices like hers was the need of the hour for Indian literature. 
 
  Apart from this, Nikita also spoke about how her life in multiple towns and cities across India, and her move to the US had helped her to be receptive to new ideas. The time she spent as an editor in the publishing industry had also helped the writer in her. "I was an editor before I became a writer," she says. 
 
  Nikita spoke about the various ways in which romantic relationships in books often create stereotypes about women, and touched on the subject of strong female friendships - a relationship which is often ignored in favour of typical male female romantic relationships. 
 
  The event was organized by Prabha Khaitan Foundation, Shree Cement and Siyahi, a Jaipur-based literary agency.
