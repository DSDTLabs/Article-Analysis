BHOPAL: Former independent legislator Paras Saklecha, who raised   irregularities case repeatedly in   assembly, joined the   party in New Delhi on Tuesday. Saklecha popularly known as Paras Dada accepted Congress membership in the presence of   general secretary in charge of state affairs Deepak Babaria, PCC chief Arun Yadav, Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha and MP from   seat Kantilal Bhuria.

 “The present BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is corrupt and a change is required, that is why I have joined the Congress party,” Paras Saklecha said.
 
 “Everyone feels harassed in the three-terms of BJP rule— be it farmers, youth or students. Vyapam scam did not reach its logical conclusion. A political change is the need of the hour so that people can get justice,” he said.
 
 As an independent MLA between 2008 and 2013, Saklecha raised the Vyapam issue as vocally as the Congress Opposition. During the Vyapam investigations, he submitted thousands of papers to the investigating agency, the STF. Later, he even published a 100-page book on Vyapam irregularities titled, “Vyapamgate”.
 
 Saklecha represented the Ratlam Town assembly seat in the House. A gold-medalist in physics and a mathematician, he started his career as a bank clerk but coached thousands of students for their railways and banks recruitment examinations. He won the mayoral elections in Ratlam in 1999.
 
 In 2003, he contested as Congress candidate from Ratlam Town but was defeated by BJP’s former home minister Himmat Kothari. The next assembly polls in 2008, he contested as an independent and won the seat defeating Kothari by a margin of over 32,000 votes.
 
 However, he was disqualified from contesting the elections in 2013, but, the following year unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha polls from Mandsaur Lok Sabha seat as AAP candidate.
