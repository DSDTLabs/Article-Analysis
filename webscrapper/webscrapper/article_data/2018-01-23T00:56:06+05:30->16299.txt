NEW DELHI: The   on Monday said the plea of former  , IM Quddusi, seeking a court-monitored probe into the leak of confidential transcripts to media, was a “clear attempt at fishing and roving inquiry to gain knowledge of what forms part of case diary”. 

 Quddusi is accused of extending help to an   that had been barred from admitting students to its medical course for two years, to allegedly procure favourable judicial orders. He was arrested on September 20, 2017 and is currently out on bail. 
 
 “Such an attempt at the part of the accused only interferes in the investigation and violates the basis on which concession of bail was granted to the applicant,” reads the CBI reply filed in connection with Quddusi's application. The former judge had moved the court of special   on January 17 with his plea for the probe. The ex-judge had also pleaded that the court must prevent a trial by media. The court had sought the investigating agency’s response by Jan 22. 
 
 Responding to Quddusi’s contention, the CBI said there were many sources from where the media can source the transcripts.
