Gandhinagar: The issue of threat calls made by underworld don   to Congress MLAs continued to rock the   for the third consecutive day with Congress MLAs expressing they were afraid to return to their constituencies during the Holi festival.

 Vaghela said that Pujari was no one to decide whether Khanpura should contest the elections or not. It was his party high command who would decide. Replying to the debate, minister of state for home,  , said that the government was sure that the case would be cracked soon and even the central investigating agencies are working on this case. He said that the government was equally concerned and has given full protection to the MLAs.
 
 C K  , who had received threat messages once again, reiterated that he was not concerned of his life, but his family was disturbed. He even tried to give it a political twist and said that he does not know if BJP MLAs are getting such threats or not, but he questioned why only Congress MLAs were getting such threat messages. 
 
 Raolji said that one could understand the motive of threat messages for extortion, but he failed to understand why the underworld don was threatening Congress of not contesting the election.
 
 However, senior minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma replied that the government was concerned and investigation were going on. “But it would not be fair to give a political twist to the entire incident,” he said.
