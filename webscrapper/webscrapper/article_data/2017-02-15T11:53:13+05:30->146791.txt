NAGPUR: Union minister Nitin Gadkari had mooted a plan to reserve a stretch for hospitals on the upcoming Orange Street project, better known as  , so that big hospitals causing congestion at Dhantoli and Ramdaspeth could move to the new location. However, it doesn’t seem like the hospitals have any plans to shift. Instead, they have proposed to build additional facilities at the new location.

 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis spoke about the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) initiative to Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) at a meeting in January. A week later,   also presented the plan to   (IMA).
 
 A VHA member from a Dhantoli hospital said, “People from nearby regions of the country are very well aware that Ramdaspeth and Dhantoli are the medical hubs of the city and of Central India for treatment as well as diagnosis. All facilities are available in one locality. So, I don’t think it will be a good idea to move all the big hospitals out. Moreover, it will cost a lot for any hospital to move the entire set-up.”
 
 It is likely that the hospital expansion plans will present a good response to NMC’s ambitious project planned between Wardha Road and   in South-West constituency.
 
 “We are yet to hear the exact location for the hospitals in the project. We will go through the project and then take a decision. But it a nice move and can help hospitals plan expansion or new ventures within the city,” said a VHA member.
