NEW DELHI: The crackdown on slaughter houses in   was raised in   on Friday, with a Trinamool Congress member saying that due to the “arbitrary clampdown”, the livelihood of thousands of people had been affected.

 However, the Centre rejected the allegations, saying action was being taken only against illegal slaughter houses and genuine ones would not be touched.
 
 Raising the matter during zero hour, TMC member Nadimul Haque said that worrying reports were coming from UP and other states like Jharkhand. He said the action against meat sellers appeared to be “one-sided” and it had to be factored in that butchers generally belonged to weaker sections of society who had pursued the profession for generations.
 
 He said the “arbitrary clampdown” was an affront to the right of people to earn a living by following an occupation of their choice.
