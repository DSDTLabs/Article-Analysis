GUWAHATI: The   ( ) has protested against the state government's move to make Sanskrit a compulsory subject till Class VII in all schools. The organization described the move as a well-orchestrated conspiracy micro-managed and monitored from Nagpur (the RSS headquarters). It added that the government should employ adequate teaching staff in all schools, provide free textbooks to students, and recruit all TET-qualified candidates before thinking about making Sanskrit compulsory.

 President of AJYCP Biraj Kumar Talukdar also accused the government of trying to recruit Sanskrit teachers from outside the state. "We will not allow teachers from outside to be recruited in our schools. Rather, the government should focus on improving the present status of schools in rural areas and providing textbooks on time," he said.
 
 He added that AJYCP was not opposed to Sanskrit since the ancient language needed to be preserved and promoted. "But we do express grave concern over the way the government is imposing the subject. The decision is too premature in view of the shortage of teaching staff in hundreds of schools. Many of these schools have been running with only one teacher," he said.
 
 The AJYCP president questioned the intent behind the move. He said, "Where will the government get so many Sanskrit teachers? This is not unknown to chief minister   and his education minister  . The conspiracy is being micro-managed from New Delhi and Nagpur. Lack of Sanskrit teachers in   will force the government to hire thousands of teachers from outside."
