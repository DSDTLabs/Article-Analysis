NEW DELHI: To incentivise women to take up employment in the formal sector, the finance minister proposed an amendment to the   &  , 1952, to reduce their contribution to 8% for the first three years against the existing 12%. This will effectively mean a higher take-home pay for them.

 There will be no change in the employer's contribution. The flip side: their compulsory savings will come down.
 
 Also, the government will contribute 12% of wages of new employees in   for all sectors for the next three years, Arun   said.
 
 The move is aimed at boosting job creation.
 
 Currently, an employee contributes 12% of his/her basic salary as the statutory monthly contribution to EPF and a matching contribution is made by the employer.
 
 With the existing contribution of 1.16% towards   subscribersâ€™ basic wages, the government bears an annual burden of around Rs 6,750 crore.
 
 The current 8.65% interest rate on EPF deposits was lowered during the last fiscal, from 8.8% in 2015-16. According to EPFO, 36.8 lakh new members in the age group of 18-25 years were added as of November 2017.
