NOIDA: Slow-paced vehicular movement was witnessed at three entry points to Delhi from Noida as the Delhi Police sealed the UP-Delhi borders on Monday.

 The entry points to Delhi from Noida-  , Kalindi Kunj and New Ashok Nagar- were sealed by Delhi police as precautionary measures in the wake of the Jats announcing that they would hold a march to the Parliament on Monday which was seen as a resumption of their agitation.
 
 Ample police deployment was witnessed at the three borders and officers checked the heavy vehicles travelling from Noida towards Delhi.
 
 The Noida traffic police issued an advisory to commuters on twitter alerting them about the sealed borders and asking them to use other routes.
 
 While the Noida end of the DND Flyway saw a free run of vehicles till around two kilometres ahead of the Toll plaza, vehicles lined up on the Flyway before the MCD toll collection booth where officers of the Delhi police were deployed for checking of vehicles.
 
 Officials could be seen prepared with head gear and lathis. They promised more aggressive checking from Monday, till the news of the Jat protest being stalled for the next days had not broke.
 
 “We are keeping a tab on the commuters coming from the UP borders. Heavy vehicles and buses, etc are being checked,” Rajinder Adhikari, ACP, Delhi Police told TOI, adding that police teams will monitor the border 24 hours.
 
 Commuters travelling from Noida and Greater Noida took almost double the time to cross the stretch of the main road towards Delhi passing by the Dalit Prerna Sthal. The stretch from near the Dalit Prerna Sthal till New Ashok Nagar in Delhi saw slow vehicular traffic till 6 pm in the evening.
 
 Moreover, the commuters travelling via the Mahamaya Flyover-Kalindi Kunj route who already witness slow traffic near the upcoming sector 94 police station due to a diversion created for the under-construction underpass at the spot, had to further slow down on the Shahdara bridge.
