NEW DELHI: Dr RK Sharma, a retired government hospital employee, has moved   ( ) pleading that the BS-IV norms for all vehicles roll out from April 1, 2017. The application has been filed following the automobile industry’s efforts to defer the EPCA deadline so that the companies can exhaust their inventory of BS-III vehicles. 

 NGT issued notices to the ministries of road transport and highways (MoRTH), and environment,   (SIAM) and   (CPCB) on Wednesday asking them to respond to the plea within two weeks. 
 
 Sharma, who used to live in Delhi, lost his wife to cancer a few years ago and believes that air pollution in the capital had aggravated her condition, said his lawyer Anand Sharma. He moved from Vasant Kunj to Sonepat a few years ago because of air pollution. BS-IV norms will substantially reduce particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen emissions from vehicles, the plea states.
 
 The application refers to MoRTH’s August 19, 2015 notification that said all vehicles across the country would have to adopt BS-IV norms from April 1, 2017. It also refers to a meeting held by the SC-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) on October 19, 2016 with all these stakeholders where the deadline was mentioned and SIAM was told to communicate it to all automobile manufacturers. EPCA reiterated its directions on January 20, 2017. 
 
 SIAM has told EPCA that it needs to exhaust its inventory first. According to Sharma’s plea, “The effect of increasingly stricter emission norms gets diluted when newly manufactured vehicles adhering only to older and more polluting emission norms continue to be sold...Such an approach would be against the very spirit of the regulation.”
