Pune: The Centre is yet to sanction funds for the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar Metro stretch, raising questions about the viability of the public private parnership (PPP) model of the project to be implemented by PMRDA.

 The state government approved the Metro proposal in the first week of January. While the Centre’s share of viability-gap funding was Rs 1,200 crore, the state was supposed to generate Rs 812 crore. 
 
 “If the Centre does not allocate the funds in time, we have to prepare a back-up plan. The Centre is worried about the rates to be levied and if the routes will be feasible for the private players,” PMRDA chief Kiran Gitte told TOI on Monday. 
 
 He will meet central finance department officials on March 7 to decide on the future course of action. The 23.3km-long Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar stretch is the third Metro route for the city and is expected to cost Rs 8,313 crore.
 
 Gitte said the feasibility study on the Hyperloop project was on track and the main team Virgin Hyperloop One was expected to set base in Pune for the work. The state had signed an MoU with the company to check the feasibility for the Pune-Mumbai route that will reduce travel time between the two cities to 25 minutes.
