KOCHI: Legal metrology department, on Tuesday, said that strict action will be taken against retailers who sell construction materials without proper declaration on the package as well as those who sell water meters without proper licence. 

 The move comes in the light of a series of raids conducted by the department in retail shops in Ernakulam, Thrissur,   and  . Cases were registered against 14 retailers for selling products without declaring the MRP, the date of manufacturing and the information regarding the manufacturers. 
 
 "In the absence of a declaration, retailers can sell products at exorbitant rates. We carried out the special drive at shops selling door locks, sanitary wares, construction goods, levers and plumbing equipment after we we received a tip on Monday. Around six cases were registered in Ernakulam, followed by four in Thrissur and two each in Idukki and Palakkad districts. At first, retailers will be fined for violating the law but if they commit the offence more than once, legal action will be initiated .We have received around 10 complaints from consumers in this regard. Majority of the complaints were reported from Ernakulam," said  , deputy controller, central zone, legal metrology department, Kakkanad.
 
 The deputy controller said that in the coming days the drive will be intensified.
 
 Meanwhile, an official with legal metrology department said that three cases have been registered against retailers located in Ernakulam for selling water meters without obtaining licence from the legal metrology department. 
 
 "As per the law, all those who are involved in the sale of water metres have to register with the legal metrology department. We have taken action against those retailers who failed to do so. The most surprising fact is that these shops are operating right under the nose of   offices in the district," said an official with legal metrology.
