AGARTALA: A day after   kicked off the party's   campaign, the   dismissed all allegations levelled by Shah against the incumbent   as "false" and "motivated to misguide the common people". 

 "Shah levelled false allegations against the state government to instigate an anti-incumbency wave. But BJP should try to know the political culture of Tripura. Here, people judge everything based on their practical experience. Unnecessary slander and terrorising voters cannot win an election,"   state secretary Bijan Dhar said on Monday.
 
 Countering Shah's accusation that the Manik Sarkar-led government has not put funds allotted by the Centre for the state's development to use, Dhar said the state government had never accused the Centre of not releasing funds. Rather, he added, the government has always highlighted that the funds that have been released by the Centre were not adequate.
 
 Supporting Dhar's statement, state finance minister Bhanu Lal Saha cited the expense-funding gap in development projects in the state. For the construction of a flyover here, Saha said, the state government had estimated an expense of Rs 250 crore. The Centre released only Rs 96 crore and said the state government should bear the rest, he added.
 
 Citing another instance, Saha alleged that the state government had demanded Rs 64,215 crore for the XIV Finance Commission, but was allocated only Rs 31,309 crore - a mere 58% of the state's total requirement. Chief minister Manik Sarkar had written to PM Narendra Modi to release Rs 18,000 crore to the state as special grants, but it remains unaddressed, he added.
