MOHALI: The municipal corporation (MC) here is all set to spend Rs 5 crore for the overall maintenance and upgradation of the city parks. The MC has also issued the work orders in this regard.

 The finance and contracts committee headed by mayor   recently cleared the work orders for all the 529 big and small parks in the city.
 
 MC commissioner   said that the funds have been allocated following the demands of the residents and considering the poor condition of the parks in the city.
 
 “These funds are being allocated for the general maintenance of various parks in the city. The maintenance works would include repairs of swings, jogging and walking tracks, provision of watering of the parks, repair and painting of grills, landscaping, construction of gazeebos and benches. Cleanliness work has already been outsourced by the MC,” he said.
 
 Hans added that the residents often complained about the poor condition of various parks in the city. They said that the conditions there were not favourable for the residents to walk or jog. 
 
 Meanwhile,   said that the MC was also planning to device a method for draining out the rain water from the city the parks. “A plan to create a slope for stagnant water is being chalked out. The slope would navigate the water to the city sewers. This would help the residents use the facilities even after a heavy rainfall,” Hans said.
 
  The civic body has also allocated funds for cleaning city drains. “The MC will spend Rs 2 crore on the cleaning them,” Hans added.
