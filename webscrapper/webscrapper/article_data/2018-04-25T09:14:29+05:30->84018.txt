LUCKNOW: In an embarrassment to BJP in UP, four legislators of the ruling party from   have raised the issue of lack of development in their constituencies while praising the development work undertaken by the constituency's   MP  . 

 The legislators have written to UP CM   pointing out that despite BJP having five out of six MLAs in Badaun, the impact of SP MP Dharmendra Yadav has not diminished. 
 
 "If we don't pull up our socks, it would be very difficult to wrest the (Lok Sabha) seat from Samajwadi Party," the letter written by the legislators, Mahesh Chandra Gupta, Radha Krishna Sharma, Rajeev Singh and  , says. "Badaun is one of the most backward districts. Since 2009, Dharmendra Yadav has been serving this district. After SP government was formed in 2012, he went on to start a state medical college, launched overbridges to remove the traffic jams and four-lane road network along with a bypass to bring this   seat at par with other towns of UP. Besides, an engineering college and polytechnic was started by SP to help students. Such big infrastructure projects have made the SP and Dharmendra Yadav very popular here," the letter says.
 
 The legislators say that because of these development works, BJP would not be in a position to win here in 2019.
