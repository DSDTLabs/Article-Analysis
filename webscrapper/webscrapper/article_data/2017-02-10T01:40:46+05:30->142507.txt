NEW DELHI: Ahead of the civic polls, Delhi   received a shot in the arm with AAP’s municipal councillor Anil Malik joining the party on Wednesday. Malik called his joining “ghar wapsi” as before joining AAP, he was with Congress. He cited his disillusionment with AAP for retuning to Congress at a press conference attended by DPCC chief Ajay Maken, former PCC chief and senior Congress member Arvinder Singh Lovely and some senior councillors. 

 Congress had won five seats in the 2016 byelections while the AAP and   had secured five and three seats respectively. Malik had won the Nanakpura ward with smallest margin among the 13 wards for which bypolls were held in May last year. He had defeated BJP’s Nitin Sharma by 522 votes. “I contested the election for the Nanakpura ward on an AAP ticket and after becoming the local councillor, not even once we were guided by the senior party leaders. I realised the party is not at all serious about fighting against corruption,” he added.
 
 With Malik returning to Congress, Congress has now six councillors who had won the byelections last May, Maken said. 
 
 Post delimitation, Nanakpura ward has been dissolved. Malik said that the party would decide from which ward he would be contesting election in April. “After the delimitation exercise, majority of the area has been transferred to nearby wards. It will be the party’s decision from which ward I will be contesting the municipal elections,” said Malik.
 
 Maken said Malik returned to Congress without any pre-condition. Malik’s wife, Sundari, had contested the 2012 civic elections on a Congress ticket. She was also present on the occasion.
