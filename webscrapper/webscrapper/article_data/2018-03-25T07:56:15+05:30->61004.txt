"We totally sympathise with whatever might have happened to you on February 14, but we definitely assure you a magical March 14,” read the official post of the students’ union of Hans Raj College this year, while promoting Confluence, the annual cultural festival of the college, where Punjabi singer   of   fame performed. While they were promoting the event, the present student union of the college also took a jibe at last year’s fest, when   left his performance midway due to a gas leak, leading to a stampede at the fest. The fest this year, however didn’t end abruptly like the previous year.

 Mankirt reached the college on time and performed in front of a sizeable crowd at the sports ground of HRC. Starting with Badnam, the singer also sang Khayal, Kadar and other Punjabi songs. Not just the students, but also the principal (acting) of the college,  , was seen dancing to the tunes of the singer at the fest. Although the singer did not interact much with the audience, before leaving after his last song, he said, “Thank you so much for the love and support that you have given to all my songs. Aise hi pyaar karte rahiye.”

 Students from different colleges were present in huge numbers at the fest due to the popularity of the singer. While there was no major issue with the management, it was certainly a task to manage the crowd. Animesh Dwivedi, the president of the students’ union, told us, “It was a very difficult task to manage the crowd. But my team managed it well and we are glad that everything went smoothly. I would also like to thank our principal and union advisors for the same.”
 Mayank Gupta, a second-year student of Physics (Hons) from the college, added, “Not just Mankirt’s performance, but the whole fest was appreciated by everyone.”
