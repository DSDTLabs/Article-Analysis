The   yesterday has issued an advisory to every Indian state to "sensitise" the mass into presenting   with a book or a   handkerchief instead of bouquets during his visits, said sources at the  .

  The advisory says, "It has been desired by the competent authority that no bouquet may be presented to the Prime Minister during his tours within India. At best, one flower along with a khadi handkerchief or a book may be presented to welcome the dignitary. All states and UTs (Union territories) are requested to suitably sensitise all concerned to ensure strict compliance of the above instructions." 
 
  The move is a follow-up after prime minister Modi, during a trip to Kerala, had urged people to gift him a book instead of a bouquet of flowers. At the launch of P.N. Panicker National Reading Day celebrations in Kochi, Modi had said that there was no greater joy than reading and no greater strength than knowledge.
 
  Sources said the idea behind gifting khadi products as gifts was that it would help provide employment to a large number of needy people.
 
  The   follows a strict protocol of screening all gifts items like bouquets before they are presented to the Prime Minister.
