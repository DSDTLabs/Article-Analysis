Visakhapatnam: Owing to the   initiative by the   group, the beach road was brimming with activity and enthusiasm. Like every week, the yoga session gave way to Zumba dance session, so far the best crowd-puller among Happy Streets event that is organised from the YMCA to the Aqua sports from 5.30 am to 8 am.

 The street play presented by the children of Navy public school attracted the attention of morning walkers and joggers. Based on women empowerment, around 225 students of Class III to V participated in the event. Their play poignantly depicted gender bias.
 
 The headmistress (primary wing) of Navy Children School Naazli Shah, said, “Through inspiring dialogues and stimulating music, the message of gender equality was emphasised by the children. The street play encouraged girls to further their education and dream of becoming whatever they want to be. It will make the boys introspect about their attitude towards their mothers/sisters and change their stance towards them.”
 
 Adding that the concept of gender equaliy should be inculcated from a young age, Naazil said that platforms such as Happy Streets should be provided to children to showcase their talents.
 
 The founder and instructor at Madhu’s Aim Fitness and Dance Floor, Madhu Singh said that anyone between the age of 4 to 80 and above can opt for the Zumba fitness programme and the music and choreography are designed accordingly.
 
 “Through Zumba, one can lose weight and if the moves are practised well, it can help an individual tone their body as it includes various dance forms that concentrate on different muscle groups,” she said.
 
 The event is being conducted by the Times of India group in association with Andhra Pradesh tourism department and being supported by the police department, district administration and Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC). It will be conducted on every Sunday at the RK Beach road.
