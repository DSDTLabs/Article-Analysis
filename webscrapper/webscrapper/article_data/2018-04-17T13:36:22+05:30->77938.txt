SURAT: It’s déjà vu for residents of the Diamond City. Even one-and-a-half year after demonetization, the residents in most parts of the city are still facing severe   because many automated teller machines (ATMs) have run out of cash. 

 Most of the ATMs in Adajan area were closed on Sunday when people went to withdraw cash from their accounts. These ATMs displayed message on the screen that they were out of order and cannot dispense cash. 
 
 A government officer Rajesh Shah said, “I required cash urgently for some medical issues in my family. Believe me, I visited more than 15 ATMs in Adajan, only to return without money. Then someone told me to try the ATMs at Athwalines, where I did manage to withdraw money.”
 
  officials denying currency shortage stated that the RBI was sending currency in the range of 30-50 per cent only as against 100 per cent requirement. Also, many ATMs in the city are yet to make changes as per the new currency size. 
 
  leader Vasant Barot said, “The RBI is sending less than 50 per cent currency to the currency chest in Surat. We had submitted a memorandum to RBI earlier and were told that the government wants people to borrow less cash and make maximum use of cashless transactions. We are daily facing problems in the banks as people are not getting cash as per their requirement.”
 
 A resident in Adajan Ashok Gohil said, “I went to the bank with a request to pay Rs1 lakh from my account. They told me that they are unable to process the request and that only Rs 50,000 could be withdrawn. The banks are facing currency shortage for the past many days.”
 
 A resident of Rander Shailesh Parmar said, “Even today, most of the ATMs in our area were not able to dispense cash. The banks have put up notices outside the ATMs stating that the machine was under maintenance.”
