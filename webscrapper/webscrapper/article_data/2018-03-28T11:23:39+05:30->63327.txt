PONDA: MGP general secretary and former   has warned the party not to ally with BJP-backed candidates in the   (PMC) elections scheduled for April 29. Mamledar said his team and he would “openly” work against the BJP-backed candidates.

 Responding to the demand made by MGP’s   on Monday to expel him from his position of part secretary, Mamledar said they could do so, but even then he would not favour an alliance with BJP candidates.
 
  “Everyone has the right to demand, but it is up to the party to decide what is in favour of the party and what is not,” he said, further alleging that the demand was fuelled by greed as the “Ponda Block president was dreaming of becoming councillor now and MLA in the future”.
 
 Senior MGP functionary and PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar had said that the party would form an independent panel of those who have relentlessly worked for the party. However, Mamledar said chances were some senior party leaders would secretly work for the BJP-backed panel, adding that he would openly work against those candidates.
