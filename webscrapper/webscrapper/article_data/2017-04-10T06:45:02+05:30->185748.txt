RAJKOT: A 40-year-old woman, who was molested on a public road in Gundasar village of Gondal on Friday and then thrashed along with her husband, committed suicide by consuming poison in Rajkot on Saturday night. 

 The woman,  , was walking on the road when a local resident Bharat Thummar caught her by her arm and started making obscene demands. After Joshi slapped him for making such advances, Thummar hurled expletives at her in public view and left. 
 
 Joshi went home and told her husband Prakash, who drives an auto rickshaw for living, about the incident. The couple and their family friend Haresh Virani went and confronted Thummar near a paan kiosk. However, Thummar called his friends and all of them started thrashing the trio with sticks. 
 
 The victims first called up Abhayam women’s helpline and then approached the   to lodge a complaint. However, the police only took an application instead of registering an offence. Sources said that when the couple went back to the village, Thummar asked them to withdraw the complaint or face dire consequences. 
 
 Sonal and Prakash left the village and reached Rajkot to meet the rural superintendent of police (SP) in their rickshaw. However, before meeting the SP, Sonal consumed some poisonous substance sitting in the rickshaw when Prakash was not there. She was rushed to the civil hospital but died late in the night. 
 
 Prakash and other family members refused to accept her body unless Thummar and others are arrested. 
 
 Gondal police finally lodged an offence against Thummar and six unidentified persons. Thummar was booked under IPC sections of outraging a woman’s modesty, abetment to suicide and rioting. Only after he was detained by the police, did the family accept her body. 
 
 N K Chaudhary, police sub-inspector at Gondal Taluka police station, is investigating the case.
