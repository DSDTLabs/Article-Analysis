PUNE: The   has announced a   course. The weekend course will be held on April 7-8 and April 14-15 in collaboration with National Film Archive of India.

 Right from India’s very first talkie — Alam Ara released on March 14, 1931 — music, particularly song and dance, has always been an integral part of the narrative form of our cinema. 
 
 “The Indian film song has followed a unique journey of its own. From the earliest songs recorded in front of the camera with live orchestras to the development of the playback system – wherein the song is first recorded in a studio and subsequently played back on location for the actors to lip synch,” said   director Bhupendra Kainthola while announcing the course on Saturday. 
 
 The course will be conducted by Karan Bali, FTII alumnus of film direction, 1993. It will be held at NFAI auditorium in Kothrud. Admissions will be on first-come-first-served basis, while the deadline for submitting applications is March 27.
