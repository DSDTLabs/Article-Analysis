VADODARA: Controversies seems to follow   (DPIL) managing director, Amit  , against whom CBI registered complaint of cheating and criminal conspiracy on Thursday. 

 Bhatnagar was arrested by the Vadodara central excise officials in March 2015 for evading excise duty to the tune of Rs 42 crore. Excise officials had said that Bhatnagar’s company showed on paper that it purchased goods to get excise benefits but the goods were never actually bought. It was a fraudulent misuse of Cenvat credit, according to the officials. Bhatnagar was arrested under section 9 1 (a) of the Central Excise Act and the court had granted him bail on the same day after he promised to pay up the amount. 
 
 VadFest, a four-day cultural and musical extravaganza, organized in 2015 under chairmanship of Bhatnagar too was mired in row after the local MLAs got upset for being ignored. The fest that was held with the help of the then state tourism minister   couldn’t be organized again despite the promises of making it a biennial event.
 
 He got into public life nearly a decade ago as director of Vadodara Marathon that is now the city’s biggest annual event. However, Bhatnagar had to quit VM management after major differences cropped up between him and chairperson  . He later launched Vadodara Navratri Festival.
