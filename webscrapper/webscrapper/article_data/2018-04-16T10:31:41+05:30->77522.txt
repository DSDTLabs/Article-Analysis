HYDERABAD: Railway authorities are looking at earning more revenues from the upcoming   routes, but people have already lost faith in the suburban train services. The cheap fares apart, many commuters feel that travelling on MMTS trains is a “sheer waste of time” and the service is “worse than other public transport modes” in the city.

 Almost daily, the e-complaint board for MMTS services is flooded with complaints from angry commuters. Commuters say though in the past one year, MMTS first-class ticket holders have gone up by 3.5-4%, the authorities are not looking into the issues. 
  
 
 Grievances of commuters include train delays, less frequency, excess mosquitoes at some stations, misbehaviour by staff manning ticket counters and   among others.
 
 Divya, a commuter and resident of Secunderabad, poured out her anger for poor frequency of trains during peak hours. “I travel to   every day for work and there are just two trains between 4.30pm and 6pm, but even those never come on time.”
 
 She added that in Secunderabad the authorities don’t even inform about the platform on which a train is expected to arrive. So, it becomes a daunting task for commuters, who have to wait on the foot overbridge, till they can see a train arriving, and then rush towards the respective platform.
 
 Railway officials say that the current infrastructure does not allow them to improve the frequency or run more trains till the MMTS phase-II draws to a close.
 
 Some MMTS stations have turned into breeding   Rude behaviour of staff manning ticket counters and defunct speakers at stations are also being highlighted by people in the complaint board.
