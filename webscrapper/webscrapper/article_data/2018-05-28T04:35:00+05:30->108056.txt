Ahmedabad: Residents of many societies in Hansol are eagerly waiting for the Army to open the road beside Taj Umed— an access to their societies. Following instructions from the defence minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, issued on May 21, nearly 62 roads that were partially or fully closed to civilians across 62 cantonments in the country were to be opened for public access from May 22, 6am onwards. The instructions, however, did not apply to BB Cantonment in Srinagar, Jammu cantonment, Delhi cantonment and Cannanore cantonment. A letter from Lt General-Director General, LW&E, R K Anand said. “Why is the Army delaying opening of the road when the order is being implemented across the country from May 22 onwards,” ask Hansol residents in a press release.  There is a rider, however, that the access points will be open under the watchful eye of the military police. Further, Anand has also emphasised that the “free flow of traffic will be monitored for 30 days” and security perception will then be assessed. After the ministry’s directive, sources in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) are also hopeful that the 37-year-old jinx on the road connecting western Ahmedabad to the airport — which will reduce traffic on the Shahibaug underpass — will be broken soon. The AMC has again approached the defence ministry to allow the Hansol town planning scheme road to pass beside the Army’s ammunition dump. AMC has committed to spending Rs 21 crore on a thick wall to protect the dump. The wall will be 10 feet high and several feet thick, while the road will be 24 metres wide.
