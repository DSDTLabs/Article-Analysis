CHANDIGARH:   could not find any clues to the whereabouts of missing 17-year-old Kulchief   here on Tuesday. And, unlike it had been suspected earlier, he was not in touch with Blue Whale Challenge’s first victim in Tricity,   (16), before he went missing on September 22.

 Chandigarh Police contacted their   counterparts on Tuesday to know if   was in contact with Karan. The SHO of Sector 39 police station, Rajdeep Singh, said they contacted the SHO of Panchkula’s Sector 5 police station and the cyber cell of Panchkula police. "Call records of Karan have revealed that Kulchief was not in contact with him over the mobile phone. We are yet to find any strong evidence to suggest that Kulchief was playing the Blue Whale Challenge. We have been investigating into the case, but there is still no clue,” he said. Kulchief’s sister,  , told TOI that she met SHO   and the investigating officer of the case. They assured her of all help. Police will now be publishing photographs of Kulchief in newspapers for clues and also sending them to cops in neighboring states. Kulchief, a commerce student in a private school, had been living with his sister in a rented accommodation in Sector 40 since April. He had left house on the day of his disappearance by saying that he was going for tuitions. "He took a cab. I realised later that he had gone with his luggage,” said Ranjiva, who is preparing for civil services. The siblings hail from Hoshiarpur, Punjab.
 
 When Kulchief did not return, she called him on his mobile phone, but it was switched off. She had lodged a missing person’s complaint at the Sector 39 police station.
 
 Later, Ranjiva found a drawing in which he depicted suicide by hanging and cutting veins with knife. She also found some dates written in his notebook. She said Kulchief had told one of his classmates that he would be going far away from the city.
