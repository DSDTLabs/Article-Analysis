NEW DELHI: The Ridge, which was once home to several native species, now primarily has vilayati keekars — a highly invasive Mexican species known to bury roots deep and reduce groundwater levels in the area. 

 In its 2017-18 budget, the Delhi government has announced plans to replace these trees with native species like amaltas and flower-bearing local trees.
 
 Work will begin at Central Ridge this year, according to the budget, with Rs 50 lakh allotted for the entire fiscal.
 
 In January, the forest and wildlife department carried out a study of Central Ridge and submitted a proposal to Forest Research Institute (FRI) for permission to replace vilayati keekars with native species conducive to the environment and habitat of Delhi.
 
 Experts say vilayati keekars, first planted by the British in the 1910s, prevent other species from growing near them. “The roots are known to go as deep as 20 to 25 metres in places, reducing groundwater levels. 
 
 “Delhi Ridge has lost close to 450 species due to these trees as they are invasive by nature and prevent other species from growing. This also forces birds and insects to go elsewhere,” said C R Babu, professor emeritus, Delhi University and head of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems.
 
 The forest department has consulted experts to draft an action plan to choose suitable species and conducted field inspections. According to a senior forest official, the process will start in small portions of the Ridge. 
 
 “It is a long process. We have chosen phases to plant different native species and they will be done in different areas so that a major portion of the Ridge is not affected. The action plan will decide what species can be planted and the time frame to plant them.”
 
 A similar plan was implemented in Sanjay Van in 2013 by environmentalist Air Vice Marshall Vinod Rawat (retd) with native Aravali species added to improve the ecological balance of the area.
