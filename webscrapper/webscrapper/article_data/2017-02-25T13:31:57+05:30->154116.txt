PATNA: Commercial taxes minister   on Friday asked chief secretary   and food and consumer protection department principal secretary   to get the tax disputes settled during the current financial year itself.

 The commercial taxes department believes that settlement of tax disputes would maximise tax collection in the current financial year ending March 31. As part of the drive, the officials have been asked to remain on duty even on holidays from the middle of this month. 
 
 The minister on Friday conducted a surprise inspection of the commercial taxes circle office at Anta Ghat to assess the progress made in meeting the Rs 22,000 crore target fixed for collection of commercial taxes during the current fiscal. The department’s officials were present on duty despite the day being the holiday.
 
 The Anta Ghat and Pataliputra circle offices of the department are the biggest in terms of yielding tax returns to the state. The minister held discussions with the chief secretary and food and consumer protection department principal secretary during his inspection.
 
 He also asked the officials concerned to maximise revenue collection so as to meet the target at any cost. The minister was accompanied by the department’s senior officials, including S N Jha and   as well as officer-on-special duty (OSD) Deepak Kanan.
