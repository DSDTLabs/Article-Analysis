MUMBAI: Taking stern action against a contractor’s firm that had not put up “proper” barricades while repairing a road near  , the   has imposed a penalty of Rs 5 lakh and issued showcause notices to civic engineers supervising the work. 

 The contractor was not penalized after the BMC received a complaint, but additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal, who is in charge of the roads department, initiated the action after he came across the violation, while he was travelling to the BMC headquarters from  . 
 
 The civic corporation had issued specific directives on how an area is to be barricaded, but sources said the instructions are flouted by many contractors. 
 
 “There are around 150 places in the city where road work is in progress, but one rarely finds details of the contractors, date of commencement or tentative deadline at any of these sites,” said an official. Civic officials said barricades are needed to avoid serious accidents during road excavations, repairs to drainages. Curbs on the road also warn motorists and two-wheeler riders. 
 
 “This must serve as a warning to other contractors in the city work on civic projects to follow the rule. If they don’t, we will levy heavy penalties,” Singhal said.
