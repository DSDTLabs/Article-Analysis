The music of   has gone viral with the songs generating millions of views, likes and shares alike across social media platforms over the last couple of weeks. Lyricist  , who has penned all five songs of the film, is overjoyed. “Times are changing in Telugu film industry. Be it Ram Charan in Rangasthalam, NTR in   or now   in Bharat Ane Nenu, our star heroes are ready to experiment and are backing films with socially relevant themes. Every song in this film has a strong message atttached to it and I believe that’s what has struck a chord with the audience,” says Sastry. 
The teaser of film shows Mahesh Babu, who plays a chief minister in the film, seeking to drive home the message: ‘We are living in a society. Everyone of us should be responsible and 
 accountable’. Admittedly, Sastry took his time to pen lyrics for the songs that reflect director Koratala Siva’s vision. “For me, it’s very important to understand the pulse of the film. I had long conversations with director   and music director  . I traveled to the shooting locations, interacted with the crew and even visited the editing suites to understand the story first before I began writing the lyrics,” he says. 
 Bollywood star Farhan Akhtar singing the song I Don’t Know came a pleasant surprise, he confesses. “When writing the lyrics, I had no idea who would sing the songs. It was only later that I had come to know that Farhan Akhtar would be singing the song,” says Sastry, talking about the song which has garnered over 4.4 million views.
 With over five million views, the song Vachaadayyo Saami sung by Kaliash Kher has been topping the charts too. But it is the title track, Bharat Ane Nenu that has been the biggest hit online with over 9.3 million views on the film’s official YouTube channel. “The message that we intended to send out through Bharat’s journey has reached the people,” he says, signing off.
