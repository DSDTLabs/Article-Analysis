Chandigarh: In the second case of a Kurukshetra jail inmate commiting suicide in the last seven days, Sonu Singh, a resident of Dabkheri village in Kurukshetra district was found hanging in the bathroom near his cell.

 Sources said Sonu was arrested in November 2017 for allegedly setting his house on fire. He was arrested on November 28 and had been incarcerated since then.
 
 According to jail officials, Sonu went to the bathroom at noon. When he did not come out for a long time, another undertrial forced the door open to find the Sonu’s body hanging by the water line. He used his head cloth to hang himself.
 
 The witness informed jail authorities, who informed judicial officers. A judicial inquest was initiated and family members of the deceased were informed.
 
 Sources said Sonu got married in January 2017 and his wife left after a dispute in October. On December 28, 2017, Jagdeep Malik, accused of killing three children of his cousin, killed himself in a similar manner. As Jagdeep’s family refused to accept his body, jail authorities cremated him in the cremation ground of Kuruskehtra.
