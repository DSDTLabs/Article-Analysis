CHENNAI: Direct selling FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) company Amway India announced its foray into the premium cookware segment with the launch of its ‘Amway Queen’ brand, targeting Rs 100 crore revenues from the new category.

 “We are targeting Rs 100 crore (revenue) from Amway Queen premium cookware range in 2017,” Amway India CEO Anshu Budhraja said. Research indicated that there is a latent demand for premium cookware which enables low oil, low water cooking while ensuring taste, he said.

 The premium cookware segment in India is currently pegged at Rs 250 crore and is growing by 35% per annum.
