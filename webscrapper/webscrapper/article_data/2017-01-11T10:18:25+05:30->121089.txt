NAGPUR:   on Tuesday announced that it will contest the upcoming   elections without   as its ally in a press meet at Patrakar Bhavan. Newly appointed spokesperson Tanaji Sawant confirmed the party will compete with one candidate per ward.

 Sawant criticized the BJP ruled   for reconstituting wards in the district as four wards from the previous term will become a single ward. “The BJP has tried to manipulate this election for its benefit,” said Sawant.
 
 The party alleged that contractors appointed for irrigation projects in Vidarbha are involved in corruption. It also accused the BJP of building itself as a brand and not realizing the important issues regarding the district.
 
 Sawant also condemned Orange City Waterworks’ failure to deliver on the promise of 24 hrs water supply.
 
 He said, “BJP is our nemesis in every ward. During campaigns we will also come to know of other adversaries.”
 
 The party will hold a meeting today at SAI Sabahgruh, Shankar Nagar at 4pm to discuss organization strategies.
