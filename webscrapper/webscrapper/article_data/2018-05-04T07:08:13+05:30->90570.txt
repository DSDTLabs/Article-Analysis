BENGALURU: Pourakarmikas in several wards across the city have been refusing to turn up for work following a row over   Pourakarmikas say that although the   ( ) began paying them directly instead of being paid by contractors, arrears for several months have been pending.

 
 The BBMP admitted that whileithas paidsalariesfor February and March, it is still in the process of releasing the same for January and April. However, pourakarmikas employed in various parts of the city say full salaries have not been credited for “many months” and even their salaries for December last year are pending with contractors. Many of them have not turned up for work several times in the last few months, and a protestheldin Aprilin frontof theBBMPheadquarters proved futile.
 
 Rathnamma, 23, who works in Herohalli ward, said she only received partial payment for January and February.
 
 “As per the revision, we are supposed to get Rs 14,000 in hand every month, but after the biometric system was introduced, there has been no uniformity in recording attendance. Everyone has received varying amounts of not more than Rs10,000.”
 
 Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner (health & solid waste management), BBMP, claimed salaries of “80% of genuine workers” had been paid.
 
 “The city needs 18,000 pourakarmikas who are assigned based on the size of wards,” Khan said. “We have found that between 3,000 and4000extra people have been working as pourakarmikas over the last few months. We have to crosscheck to ensure they are not ghost workers. Wehaven’t made a decision on payment to them, but we are in the processof making the biometric system foolproof and willensure all are paidsoon.”
