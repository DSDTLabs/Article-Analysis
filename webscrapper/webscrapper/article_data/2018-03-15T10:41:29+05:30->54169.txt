CHENNAI: The   ( ) Senior Division league will kick-off at the   here on Friday with the match between Arrows FC and Income Tax. The 12-team league, which usually starts around January and ends in April, will have a delayed start this season due to unavailability of the Nehru Stadium because of Chennaiyin’s Indian Super League engagements. And it has become a cause of concern for the teams.

 
 According to   ( ) rules, every district has to end their leagues by April 30. With the Senior Division starting mid-March, the CFA will only have just one-and-a-half months to complete its league. So it has slotted two games per day — one at 2pm and the other at 4pm. The clubs have raised objections that since they will play in the afternoon heat, the players will get exhausted easily. Moreover, the window for the players’ recovery will also be small since they will play three-four matches every week.
 
 Under the circumstances, the clubs have decided to request TFA to grant them permission to extend the league till May. “We had a meeting today with all the stakeholders and we have decided that we will send a letter to TFA asking them for an extension. It will be unfair for the players and they might get injured often,” a club official told TOI.
 
 An official said CFA had already requested the TFA but got no response. He also informed that they want to conduct the matches under floodlights but are yet to get permission from SDAT since the member secretary is on leave.
 
 “Initially, we thought that we will hold the matches at ICF ground. But the ground wasn’t in condition to host the league. We are having our first division games there. We had verbally asked TFA to extend the league but they have not responded. We couldn’t wait any longer. Otherwise we couldn’t have completed the league. Hopefully, we will get the permission to extend the league and also to conduct the games under lights. Then we will chalk out new fixtures,” the official said.
