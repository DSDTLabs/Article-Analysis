PUNE: The fledgling of a kite fell off its nest and landed in the car park of   on Monday morning where advocate   found it. The bird was blind and unable to fly to safety. 

 Anil Naik, "When I reached the   court around 11am on Monday, I saw the bird cowering under a tree. Its eyes were shut. We gave it some water."
 
 Naik contacted bird rescuer  . "The fledgling was barely one-and-a-half months old. Its eyes and head were infected with chicken pox. We brought it back to my residence and are treating it now," he told TOI.
 
 Infections occur when nests are unclean or if there is decaying food .
 
 "The fledgling must have been infected and fallen off the nest because it could not see," Avachite said. The bird will be treated for 10 to 12 days before the infection is gone.
 
 "It will be able to fly back to its nest in a fortnight. If there is any deterioration, we may move the bird to the rescue centre at Katraj zoo," Avachite added.
