NAGPUR: “The Vedas called   ‘Sarva roga nivarini’, means ‘one that cures all ailments and ills’. In the Hindu month of Chaitra, the entire qualities of the tree get concentrated in its bark, so consuming its juice during this time of the year gives 100% medicinal effect,” said  , from Digras in Yavatmal, who has studied the tree for the last 35 years, here on Wednesday. 

 Banginwar explained this while distributing the juice at five-day ‘Arogya Amrut Shibir’ organized by   at Vasavi Kalyan Mandapam, Ram Nagar. 
 
 “This tree has grown among human settlements all over the country and has been an integral part of the Indian way of life since centuries. The history of the tree is inextricably linked to the history of the Indian civilization. Products made from neem tree have been use in India for many years,” said Banginwar. 
 
 He explained how to extract juice from neem’s bark.
 
 “It is also used for healthy hair, to improve liver function, detoxify blood, and balance blood sugar levels. Neem leaves have also been used to treat skin diseases like eczema, psoriasis, and many more. It is also used against 500 types of insects, mites, ticks, and nematodes. It does not normally kill pests right away, rather it slows their growth and drives them away,” said Banginwar.
