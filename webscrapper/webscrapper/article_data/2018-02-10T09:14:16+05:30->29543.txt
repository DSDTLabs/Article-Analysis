AHMEDABAD: A 21-year-old US citizen, who was in the city for cultural studies, jumped from third floor of a Mithakhali-based   on Friday afternoon in a suspected  . The girl landed on roof of the first floor and sustained head and body injuries. She is kept under observation at the hospital’s ICU. Navrangpura police have registered a non-cognizable offence and have started probe.

 According to investigators, Lydia (last name withheld to protect identity), a resident of New York and studying in a US university, had come to Ahmedabad to study Indian culture and religion. Her local guardian, living near Law Garden, had observed that she had increased her intake of anti-depressant pills and had informed her parents back home.
 
 “She was to return to the US on February 7 and her flight tickets were booked. However, her symptoms worsened en route and at the airport she was declared unfit to fly. She was directly admitted to the HCG Hospital near Mithakhali Crossroads and was kept in an isolation ward for psychiatric treatment,” said a police investigator.
 
 At the hospital, she was first kept on sixth floor, but as she tried to assault the nursing staff and jump, she was shifted to a ward on third floor. On Friday, a nurse approached her at about 3 pm for medications when Lydia allegedly bit her and managed to break the glass window to jump.
 
 Abhijeetsinh Parmar, inspector of Navrangpura police station, told TOI that Lydia’s declaration will be recorded once she is declared fit by the medical staff of the hospital. “Her family has been informed about the incident and they are expected to reach Ahmedabad early on Saturday morning. We have sought details of her medical history,” he said.
