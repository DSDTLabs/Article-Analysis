MANGALURU: When the people of a village refused to help a man ferry the body of his 80-year-old father who collapsed and died on a hilly road, two   and a homeguard lent a helping hand. The officers and the son carried the body on their shoulders to the deceased’s house in Gulgodi village, Koila (Dakshina Kannada district) on Saturday.

 Asalappa, died when he was walking from Jambadahalli. Though several people saw him collapse and breathe his last, they didn’t touch the body. The locals of Koila have organised a Nema festival (a ritual offered to local deities in Tulunadu) on Sunday and touching a body during Nema is considered ‘sootaka’. It’s a custom which prevents devotees from entering the temple or daivasthana premises if they touch a body in any form or when someone from their family dies. The family members of the person touching the body are also be barred from entering religious places.
 
 B R Ravikanthegowda, superintendent of police, Dakshina Kannada, told TOI that when Asalappa’s son heard about the death, he cried for help but no one, including close relatives, came to his help.
 
 “Asalappa’s house is located atop a hill. It was next to impossible for his son to carry the body there. When nobody came to help him, policemen pitched in,” he said.
 
 “Police sub-inspector Prakash, assistant sub-inspector Ravi from Kadaba police station and   Sandesh rushed to the spot and carried the body on their shoulders to Asalappa’s house,” the SP said.
 
 Ravikanthegowda announced a reward for these three men police officers and an appreciation letter to the journalist who brought the issue to the notice of the police.
