While it’s true that fans create and sustain stars, there have been many instances of obsessed fans spelling trouble for their screen idols. The latest example is  , the lead actress of   show ' '. 
For the past two weeks, a fan has been stalking her with innumerable phone calls. The person in question has even created a fake Instagram profile, where he continues to upload pictures of the actress and her loved ones. Not stopping at that, he tags everyone in Bhumika’s network as well. 
 The phone calls started as soon as the promos of her show went on air. She says, “In the beginning, I felt that my friends were playing a prank on me and entertained the calls . However, I soon realised that he is mad. Apart from sending me lots of messages, he would call me at least five-six times in a day. He also accessed my personal pictures on social media and created a fake Instagram account in my name. I have finally lodged a complaint with the cyber crime cell in Mumbai.” 
 Bhumika, who is relatively new in showbiz, feels that social media needs to be stricter with their privacy settings. She says, “Why have a social media account if your pictures start circulating on the internet and your phone number gets leaked?” She adds, “Just because actresses post glam pics on social media, it doesn’t give anyone the right to stalk them. Even if I post a nude picture, no one has the right to put me through so much trouble. Those who say that it is normal for actresses to get stalked are immature. Nobody can invade another person’s privacy.”
