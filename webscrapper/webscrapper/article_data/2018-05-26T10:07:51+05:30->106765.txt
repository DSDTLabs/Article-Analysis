BAREILLY: UP DGP Om   on Friday announced that the department was planning to launch special   in the state, the first of its kind, to check crime against women.
 
 The DGP, who was in  , said that these special battalions will have 1,000 constables, who’ll primarily focus on safety of women in UP. “Moreover, the department is also planning to integrate various women helplines for the convenience of females,” he said, adding that a proposal in this regard has been sent to the state government.
  
  While addressing a press conference at Bareilly Police Lines, Singh said, “The objective behind integrating these helplines is to ensure that in case of an emergency, a woman is immediately provided help. After a call is received, the integrated service will forward the case to the concerning helpline. For instance, if a woman has been teased and is complaining about the same, her call will be handed over to the anti-Romeo squad. Easy access to police is what we are looking for.”
  
  Officials said that the office of the special battalion will be set up near the main road in a well-connected locality of a city.
  
  In an attempt to bring transparency in imposing fines on traffic violations, the DGP launched the e-challan facility in Bareilly. The system will enable traffic police to automatically generate challans for offenders and collect fine on the spot. 
  
  Speaking with TOI, SP (traffic)   said, “The system will also allow the department to trace repeat offenders. As soon as the vehicle registration number will be entered into the device, it will provide the required details of the vehicle and its owner. The offenders will have the option of paying fines through debit/credit cards.”
  
  Till now, to issue a challan, the traffic police used to manually enter the registration number of the vehicle into the challan book following which a notice was served to the violator. However, the new e-challan system will now shorten the process and will save time.
