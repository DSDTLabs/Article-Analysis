NEW DELHI:   MP Shashi Tharoor’s bid to raise in   the issue of “intolerance” linked to violence at Delhi’s Ramjas college over a seminar where JNU activist Umar Khalid was invited has run into rough weather with Congress members expressing reservations over the political implications of the move.

 Sources said Tharoor expressed a desire to bring up the Ramjas college incident in Parliament at a meeting of the Congress strategy group on Tuesday. BJP-aligned student outfit ABVP had disrupted the seminar protesting the participation of Khalid, a key figure in the row over “anti national” slogans at an event to protest the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru that hit JNU in 2016. Khalid was charged with sedition and jailed before being released.
 
 Sources said Tharoor’s suggestion was met with resistance from some Congress MPs and according to aCongress MP, though many spoke about “rising violence” linked to ABVP, there was a general consensus that the party “needed to be careful of antinational slogans”. The view seemed to have been sharpened in the aftermath of the UP elections where BJP was seen to have benefited by a Hindu mobilisation.
 
 It is still not clear whether the issue will be raised in Lok Sabha, but it has not been mentioned in the party’s list of priorities since the robust discussion at the meeting of Congress   group.
 
 This marks a sharp departure from the JNU controversy of 2016 when entire political opposition had banded together to decry the role of police and ABVP, and by extension the Modi government, in what they called was framing of students. Rahul Gandhi had personally taken the lead.
 
 Clearly, the political winds appear to have influenced the party attitude towards controversies involving universities.
