The state endowment commissioner, who looks after administrative matters of different temples in the state, on Wednesday pulled up the   temple management and commissionerate   over fans taking selfies with   actor   and filming her inside the shrine on Sunday. Cell phones and cameras are not allowed in the 11th century shrine.

 “I was shocked to find (in video and photos) so many people carrying cell phones in the temple. Strangely, some sevayats (servitors) were seen carrying phones during Raveena’s visit. Some cops, who were present in the temple, did not dissuade people from carrying phones. The police personnel should have frisked the visitors properly before allowing them to enter the temple,” endowment commissioner   told TOI. Dutta said he asked the temple’s executive officer and commissionerate police to submit their reports on the circumstances leading to the entry of cell phones to the temple within two days.
 
 Raveena visited the temple on Sunday. A day after her visit, a video went viral on social media, featuring a man shooting Raveena and some others posing for selfies with her on the shrine premises. Raveena found herself in controversy after some priests and temple body alleged that she was shooting an advertisement. Raveena, while speaking to TOI on Tuesday, denied she was shooting any commercial, nor asked anyone to shoot her in the temple. She also expressed ignorance about the phone ban in the temple. “I was just responding to queries of people in the video. I neither used my phone nor asked anyone to shoot me. I had no idea about the temple's restriction,” Raveena said. 
 
 On Tuesday, the temple management lodged a complaint against Raveena with Shree Lingaraj police. Police did not register a case as the charges, mentioned in the written complaint, were non-cognizable in nature.
