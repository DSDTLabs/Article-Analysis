Indore:   have made it compulsory for owners of new vehicles to complete all   within seven days of the purchase. If they fail to do so, owners will have to come to the regional transport office ( ) to get their   done.

 As of now automobile dealers had to complete all registration related formalities, but with the new instruction from the RTO, the vehicle owner will have to ensure its completion within the stipulated time.
 
 “If the vehicle owner fails to get this done within seven days, he will have to come to the RTO office along with his vehicle for a verification process,” said regional transport officer MP Singh. He added that the verification process will include cross checking the vehicle’s chassis and engine numbers. An officer will tally both the chassis and engine’s numbers with the details provided by the dealer.
 
 People who opt to purchase VIP registration numbers for their vehicles will have to ensure they buy them early too in order to get them registered under these numbers.
 
 Officials said that the move has been decided upon to keep a check on vehicles plying without registration numbers in the city. “Many people opt to purchase a VIP number for their newly purchased vehicles, and for this they do not get their vehicles registered on time. Sometimes, such vehicles are stolen or used for criminal activities,” they said. They added that making the deadline compulsory will curb such kind of illegal practices.
 
 Meanwhile, the government is also in process to make compulsory for automobile dealers to complete registration-related formalities within seven days of the vehicle being sold. Besides, the government also plans to levy a fine on dealers if they fail to comply by this compulsion. This is not the case now. At present, there is no compulsion on the part of dealers to complete all registration related formalities
