HYDERABAD:   is expecting over one lakh people to attend Telangana Praja Garjana, the public meeting to be addressed by AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi in   on June 1. 

 Telangana   president N Uttam Kumar Reddy has given a call to party workers and sympathisers that at least 10 people from every village should voluntarily come and attend the Telangana Praja Garjana.
 
 "There are over 8,600 gram panchayats in Telangana and 10 people from each village would mean 86,000 crowd. Then there would be over 30,000 to 50,000 crowd from Sanga Reddy and Medak. No special buses are being arranged to mobilise crowd for the meeting. We are confident that the voluntary participation will touch one lakh," Uttam told TOI over phone after inspecting the venue of public meeting at Sanga Reddy on Friday. 
 
 Political pundits said participation of one lakh people voluntarily is easier said than realised even if the temperatures come down by June 1, the date of Telangana Praja Garjana.
 
 However, Congress leaders exuded confidence that the party cadre would brave heat or rain to make the meeting a grand success. 
 
 Uttam said that despite many farmers having committed suicide, the chief minister did not even have time to meet the bereaved family members. 
 
 He also added that Telangana ranks second in the list of states recording the highest number of farmers' suicides.
 
 He said thousands of farmers have faced harassment and intimidation, having refused to part with their respective lands due to non-implementation of the Land Acquisition Act 2013. 
 
 The Congress would approach the   against the new land acquisition act of the State Government. 
 
 The party would also insist on implementation of Land Acquisition Act 2013, according to him.
