Currently, she manages everything in terms of my accounting, dates, tours, tickets and stay. She knows where my shows are and is the person who ensures my tickets and stay is as per schedule. She manages my finance, too, apart from logistics, as I do not understand money. She makes sure my finances, like investments and other things, are intact.
 
 : When I was a young boy, I dreamt of becoming a pilot, like most boys do. My mum ensured I got into flying school, where I did extremely well and even topped my class. So, when I realised my passion for singing and my band was doing well and I wanted to take it up full time, she asked me if I was sure and has then supported me fully. Over a year, she saw that my band was doing well and has since been a big reason for my success as a singer.
