BENGALURU: N  , an middle-aged man from BTM Layout, has alleged that he has suffered a fracture in his backbone due to rash driving of a   bus driver. 

  Sheshadri, 57, said he was travelling from Sahakar Nagar to Majestic in BMTC bus, KA 57 F 510, on February 14. Around 2.45pm, the driver suddenly applied brakes, jolting and throwing up Sheshadri who was on the last seat. "The sudden jerk fractured his backbone," alleged Naveen S, Sheshadri's son, who has written to the BMTC chairman complaining against the bus service. 
 
 "My father sensed acute pain in the back and requested the driver to stop the bus, but the driver didn't do so till it reached Majestic. Measures have to be taken against the BMTC staffers who are responsible for my father's condition," said Naveen.
 
 Sheshadri, who was travelling alone got down from the bus at Majestic, hopped on to another bus to reach East End stop and called his son to pick him up from there. Naveen, who was shocked to see his father's condition, took him to a private hospital on   in an ambulance. Sheshadri later underwent a surgery and was advised bedrest for three months. 
 
 Sheshadri, who works as a manager at a private company, spent Rs 3.5 lakh for treatment. Naveen said he may approach court based on BMTC's response.
 
 V Ponnuraj, managing director, BMTC, said: "We have received a complaint and are looking into it. Probe is on. The victim will have to approach us for compensation."
