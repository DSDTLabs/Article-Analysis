THANE: Activist Dr  , who has filed various petitions against the increasing noise pollution in the city, recently sought intervention of the Bombay High Court to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the   police commissioner Param Bir Singh and the officer in-charge AV Pophale of the Naupada Police Station for failing to adhere to the norms of the silence zone.

 Dr Bedekar knocked the doors of the HC after the police authorities reportedly turned a deaf ear to his repeated complaints about the blaring loudspeakers atop a mosque near Masunda lake overlooking that the fact that the area falls under the silence zone. The activists said the sound from the loudspeakers violates the norms laid down under the silence zone and is a cause of inconvenience to the students of the MH High school in the close vicinity.
 
 “The court has accepted my PIL and has asked police to see that the laws are followed. The mosque is barely 100 meters from MH High School and the frequent Azan causes disturbance to the students and residents surrounding the Masjid which is in a silence zone and noise pollution is not permitted,” said Dr Bedekar.
 
 The activist stated that as per laws, mosques are not allowed to put up loudspeakers so he had complained about the same to Naupada police station.
 
 “I had filed a   on December 12, 2016 but no action was taken by the senior inspector. After which, I wrote a letter regarding the nuisance caused by the noise to the police commissioner and still a status quo prevailed. Eventually, I filed an RTI to know if the mosque had the required permission from the police to put up loudspeakers, and the reply was a ‘No’. The mosque had no relevant permission to put up loudspeaker. Thus, I filed a contempt petition against the two government officials,” claimed Dr Bedekar.
 
 The hearing for the contempt petition will be held on Friday in the High Court.
