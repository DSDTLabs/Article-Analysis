Bengaluru: Mayor R Sampath Raj had promised that the stretch of   between Brigade Road and Rest House Crescent Road would be fully complete by New Year’s Eve. That promise, however, went unfulfilled. While the stretch stayed open to both traffic and the hordes of pedestrians on Sunday, work, including paving of footpaths, remained unfinished in several areas.

 However, that did not deter   revellers from thronging the cobblestone-paved street. Revellers soaked in the new-look, admiring its LED-lit pathways and wide pavements. Youngsters were seen merrily clicking selfies with friends and family on the redeveloped street. 
 
 “Last year, Church Street was a mess with stinky corners, overflowing drains and a pothole-ridden carriageway,” said Prayag CS, a PU student. “The transformation is grand. LED lighting has given an altogether new charm to this commercial hub. It is refreshing to hangout here.”
 
 Sukanya RP, a zumba trainer, echoed those sentiments. “This is the first time I’ve sat on the Church Street pavement and enjoyed a snack,” Sukanya said. “I really hope that the authorities concerned complete all the work and throw it open for the public to thoroughly enjoy.”
 
 Supreeth M, a PU student, said he and his friends decided to hangout on Church Street and ring in the New Year. “The authorities should just pedestrianize this stretch,” he said. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, mayor Sampath said only a few finishing touches remained on the first phase of 450 mtrs. “This phase of Church Street will be completely ready within a week and the entire street with a renovated look will be ready by January end,” he said. “I am happy people are appreciating the hard work done by the civic body.”
