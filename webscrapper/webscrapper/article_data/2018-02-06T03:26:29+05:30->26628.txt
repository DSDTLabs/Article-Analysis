NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Monday   a   into the dubious activities in a   in the city after its   claimed “naari narak ka dwar hai”.

 An angry bench of acting chief justice Gita Mittal and justice C Hari Shankar warned advocate Amol Kokane it can initiate contempt proceedings against him for such statements, before ordering him and others to leave the court room. “The court room is not your spiritual class,” the bench told Kokane, while he defended the ashram founded by Virender Dev Dixit, who is facing a CBI probe for allegedly confining women and girls.
 
 The lawyer claimed before the bench that “according to Sankaracharya, ‘nari narak ka dwar hai’ (women are the gateway to hell)” triggering a strong objection by an anguished bench which demanded to know which Sankaracharya he was referring to, only to be met with silence. The remark by the lawyer came in response to the court’s query on why only women and girls were being “abandoned” by parents at the ashrams of the Adhyatmik Vishwa Vidyalaya founded by Dixit.
 
 Prior to that the CBI had informed the bench it has issued a look out circular (LOC) against Dixit, who allegedly kept girls and women confined at the ashram in outer Delhi. The agency said it has issued the LOC as Dixit is yet to join the investigation being conducted by CBI into the functioning of his ashrams and the complaints against him. 
 
 During the hearing HC also questioned why the ashram used the tag “vishwa-vidyalaya” or university when it was not recognised as one by the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act. The court observed that the Adhyatmik Vishwa Vidyalaya has no legal status as it is neither a registered society nor a corporate entity according to the company law.
