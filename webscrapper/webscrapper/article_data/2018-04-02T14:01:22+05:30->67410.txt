QUEPEM: The Portuguese era bridge over River Sangam at Bendvaddo, Sanguem, continues to be a vital and busy link for traffic but the approach roads which have steep slopes and no safety parapets on either side are a threat to life. 

 Despite its use by mining trucks and pedestrians, the link which caters to traffic from Margao to Sanguem has not received any attention from a safety aspect. “The government must construct a parapet along the approach roads; pedestrians’ and motorists’ safety is at stake,” local resident   said.
 
  chairperson   said that the PWD has been informed several times about the absence of a retaining wall. But officials say it is difficult to construct one on the steep slope. “Every assembly session we hear that a new parallel bridge will constructed but this assurance is being repeated for 10 years,” said Naik.
 
 PWD assistant engineer   denied any proposal to protect both sides of the approach road. The government has planned a new four-lane parallel bridge and it will be constructed by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC). The PWD has already acquired land for the project on the northern side of the bridge. The site has to be cleared before construction can begin. “ A few days ago, we got the NOC from the forest department to clear trees and then we will hand over the site to GSIDC in early April,” Nadkarni said.
 
 The bridge was built for a small population decades ago but today vehicles have to halt on either side to allow usage of the narrow transit. “The bridge spans over a river and people’s safety cannot be ignored,” said Fr Tadeo D’Silva, parish priest of Our Lady of Miracles Church, Sanguem. The approach roads are dangerously open on either side.
