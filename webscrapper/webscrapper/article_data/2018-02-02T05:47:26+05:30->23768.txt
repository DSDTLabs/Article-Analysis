CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh bench of the   (CAT) on Thursday restrained the   government from transferring chief conservator of forests (hills) Harsh  . The tribunal has also asked the Punjab government to re-consider its decision of shifting the officer and pass a well-reasoned order within a month. 

 Kumar, an Indian   (IFS) officer, had moved the tribunal on Thursday after he was transferred to the post of chief conservator of forests (information technology) at Mohali on January 30. He was moved out apparently for issuing orders that created confusion and without consulting the minister concerned.
 
 Kumar had written to project developers in Mohali to go ahead with projects on land in Mohali that came under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA). The PLPA notification is lapsing for some areas of Mohali on February 3 and for other areas on August 28.
 
 The officer had written to developers on January 22, that they could go ahead with eco-tourism activities in Tarapur village in Mohali as the PLPA notification was ending in February, thus removing restrictions. In another communication, the officer had written to developers in Karoran village to wait till the notification ended in August.
 
 Kumar has also written to the Union ministry of forests on January 31 saying he had not been given a cadre post and that the Punjab government had violated directions of the Supreme Court. He said the   had directed that there should be a review of the department promotion committee in his case and he should be considered for the post of principal chief conservator of forests.
 
 The officer had also called his transfer order mala fide.
