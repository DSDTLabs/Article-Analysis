THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: If things move as planned, the ambitious K-FON ( ) project, announced by finance minister TM  , in the last state budget would be operational by 2020. 

 "The formalities for setting up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project is in the final stage. Law department has already vetted the draft. The request for proposal (RFP) for identifying an experienced technical partner company for implementing the project would be notified in a few days. We hope the work to begin by April this year," said M G Rajamanickam, MD,   ( ).
 
 K-FON is proposed as a joint venture by KSITIL and  , each having 49% share. The rest 2% would be held by the state directly. While the state government would invest Rs 500 crore through KIIFB, the SPV would generate on its own Rs 300 crore for the project. The project is expected to ensure robust data connectivity across the state for the first time. It is also expected to substantially bring down the recurring cost for internet connectivity in government offices, schools and centres for higher education.
 
 "It is often claimed that several players in telecom sector have already laid cables in a major part of the state. The studies we have carried out as part of the project shows that internet penetration in the state is only 41%. Also, the connectivity is mainly urban centric," said Rajamanickam.
