HYDERABAD: If   survived the deadly gun attack at Austin’s Bar and Grill in  , its thanks mainly to a certain ‘Brad’. When Alok was bleeding profusely after Adam Purinton shot him, someone bandaged his wound with a shirt. It was in the ambulance rushing him to the hospital that Alok noticed the impromptu bandage on his hand that had stemmed the blood flow.

 Alok reffered to Brad during a prayer vigil organised by the Indian community in Kansas. So far, it was known that two people — Ian Grillot and Mark Hinojosa — had rushed to help Srinivas and Alok even as the gunman was shooting. Grillot was also injured.
 
 “For us, United States of America has been more about selfless people, hard working people, like Ian and Brad,” Alok said. It appeared that Brad was not at the vigil as Alok did not point him out in the crowd.
 
 Alok had come to know Brad as they were regulars at the bar. “That’s the only place I met him. After the incident, he came to my side. He did not care whether he (the gunman) would come back or the situation was under control. He just came by my side because he knew I was the one who was suffering. He removed his shirt. He knew that I was losing a lot of blood and he kept his shirt around the wound,” Alok said.
 
 “When I was being taken in the ambulance, that is when the guys told me whose shirt it was,” Alok said. They told him that was what “almost probably saved your life”. As the crowd applauded, Alok added: “That’s the reason we made this country our home.”
