PANAJI: The Goa Bird Conservation Network ( ) recently completed a   count aimed at documenting wetland bird species across the state. The census, jointly conducted by the  , is part of a global survey being carried out for Wetlands International, an organisation that works to sustain and restore wetlands. 

 A total of 16 wetlands including areas in Narve, Verna, the   lake at St Cruz, Morjim, Chapolim and the   river mouth among others were covered, with volunteers listing their sightings on a portal called ‘e-bird’. The data was later analysed by the GBCN.
 
 
  
 
 “The presence or absence of birds is a reliable indicator of the health of the wetland. From that sense, it is important to monitor the wetland for a longer period to understand what is happening to it,” GBCN founding president  , said.
 
 The GBCN will submit the report to Wetlands International, following which a copy will be shared with the state forest department. 
 
 The group will also update the census of the Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, Chorao, and will submit a report to the forest department.
 
 The wildlife section of the state forest department is also in the process of compiling a census of carnivores beginning April.
