Panaji: With barely days to go for the axe to fall on liquor outlets and establishments selling alcohol along the highways, the Goa Liquor Traders Association is now waiting with bated breath to see if the Supreme Court or the state government can give thousands of establishments some relief by April 1.

 Speaking after presenting the budget, chief minister Manohar Parrikar also promised to issue directions to provide relief to liquor outlets that operate along national highways. Parrikar said that the necessary directions would be issued by Monday evening, after taking legal opinion. The state excise department has renewed just 1,224 liquor retail and distribution licences, while 789 traders remain on tenterhooks, association president Dattaprasad Naik said.
 
 The association met on Sunday at Porvorim to discuss the outcome of several discussions with the government and to chart a way forward. The association is reluctant to file a relief petition before the Supreme Court and still prefers if the state government intervenes on its behalf. “Some states have sought clarification on the court judgment and we are waiting to see if the Supreme Court gives us relief,” Naik said.
 
 On December 15, a three-judge bench, headed by chief justice T S Thakur, ordered that licences of existing bars and liquor retailers located 500m around state and national highways should not be renewed after March 31, a move that is aimed at reducing drink-driving and road accidents that claim thousands of lives every year.
