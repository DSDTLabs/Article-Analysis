Everyone’s favourite foul-mouthed anti-hero   is coming back to a theatre near you, but just ‘not soon enough’! The teaser of the second installment was released online by leading man   instead of being attached to end-credits of Hugh Jackman’s ‘Logan’. The clip, titled ‘No Good Deed’, has become an instant hit online and the proof’s in the 12 million hits it collected on YouTube within just 48 hours of its release. 

 Ryan’s naked bottom pressed against the phone booth’s glass may have taken away a lot of screen time in the 3.42-minute clip, but once fans managed to look away, there were a lot of teasers, references and lampooning going on in the teaser. For those unaware, the changing costumes in the phone booth took a direct hit at DC comics’ Superman, while also mimicking Hugh Jackman’s Australian accent and shooting down ‘X-Men’ creator Stan Lee’s cameo in the film.

 Nonetheless, the teaser had enough to get fans up and tweeting about it. Here’s what a few had to say:
