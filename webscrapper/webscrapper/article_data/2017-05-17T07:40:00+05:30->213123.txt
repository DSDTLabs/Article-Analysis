GURUGRAM: The   on Tuesday said the residents of the private colonies that would be taken over by the civic body should pay their property   without fail ahead of the handover.

 The MCG has made it clear that since   is the major  , these colonies will be taken over by it only if all residents pay property tax without any dues.
 
 On the other hand, MCG will pay resident welfare associations (RWAs) Rs 25,000 per month to maintain the community centre as well as Rs 3 per square metre to maintain parks in their areas. The same rule will be applicable to all   across the city from now on.
 
 “We have decided that, the community centre in every area will be maintained by RWAs from now on. All the revenue generated will also go to RWA, and we will pay an additional amount of Rs 25,000 per month for its upkeep. However, if there are multiple RWAs in that area, they have to decide among themselves and reach an agreement on which RWA will maintain it. If they have not strike an agreement, we will maintain it ourselves,” said MCG commissioner V Umashankar.
 
 The MCG is also planning to levy sanitation charge on residents. “As of now we are not levying any fee on residents for door-to-door garbage collection, but residents will have to pay sanitation charge in the future. However, if the RWA is willing to compost the garbage collected from their premises, sanitation charge will not be applicable for them,” he said.
 
 The commissioner has also made it clear that residents will not have to pay any maintenance charge to MCG for providing services. “However, MCG will not provide security services, and if they wish to keep private security guards, they should do it at their own expenses. The MCG will not have any objection. The MCG will also not operate clubs in private colonies,” he said.
