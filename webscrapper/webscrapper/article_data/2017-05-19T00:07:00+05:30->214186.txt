Indore: Following the relatively simpler NEET exam, medical aspirants in the city have started to prepare themselves for tougher competition and higher level question papers for the AIIMS   entrance exam with an aim to get admitted into the country’s top institutions.

 AIIMS MBBS exam will be held on May 28 across the country and in Madhya Pradesh it will be held in seven cities. Teachers and experts have told students to focus on assertion and reasoning questions to crack AIIMS.
 
 Students have left no stone unturned ahead of the exam and have changed their schedules to devote more hours daily to studies. They have chosen to study at night for better focus and attention.
 
 “In the NEET exam I had made some really silly mistakes. I am focusing on these areas now and want to make sure that I don’t make mistakes in topics that I have prepared well. I study at night as it is quite peaceful then,” said Anugrah Vyas, a student who just completed Class XII from Shishukunj International School. 
 
 Another challenge that students face in the AIIMS exam is the equal weightage for Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry, unlike the 50 percent weightage in biology in NEET.
 
 “Students find biology relatively easy and can score in the subject. But in AIIMS’ MBBS entrance exam, equal attention needs to be paid to the other two subjects which are more technical and difficult for students. The increased number of seats for NEET this year has also made competition in NEET easier as compared to AIIMS where no seats have been increased,” Sudhir Kag, an educationist from the city said.
