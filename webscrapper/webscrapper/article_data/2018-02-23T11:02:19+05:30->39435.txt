Chief minister   has convincingly won round one of the challenge of creating a   in the state and bringing investments for industrialization to spur   and job creation. But the real test, after the high-powered two-day investors’ summit concluded on Thursday, for Yogi begins now — to see that the Rs 4.28 lakh crore pledged investment gets converted into reality.

 The conversion rate of MoUs signed by SP and BSP governments earlier has been very dismal. To end all skepticism, Yogi had promised in his summit inauguration address that he would ensure that the MoUs turn into real investments on the ground.
 
 The investment announcements by industry captains Mukesh Ambani, Kumar Mangalam Birla, Anand Mahindra, N Chandrasekaran and the Union government’s defence industrial corridor and a rail coach factory have come about after Yogi government brought in new policies for different sectors and effected changes to end red-tapism. He announced that he will keep a tab on the progress through Nivesh Mitra portal.
 
 In hindsight, CM’s aggressive approach in fighting crime despite all criticism has turned the tide in his favour.
 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself said that there was an atmosphere of fear, insecurity and negativity in the state earlier but Yogi government has brought back safety, secure and positivity.
 
 Union home minister   also said that having shed its image of being a safe sanctuary for criminals, UP has become a paradise for investors.
 
 The success of the summit has been credited in Yogi’s account, but in reality he will emerge stronger only when he ensures that investment offers fructify. Good result will help the party to conquer   once again in 2019 general elections.
 
 Yogi has succeeded in bringing the agenda of industrialization and economic development on centre stage in the state.
