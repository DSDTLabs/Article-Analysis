NASHIK:   election officials on Thursday rejected Suresh Gaidhani’s application for the post of new president of the institution here. 

 “From the four applications received for the post of president, Gaidhani’s application got disqualified. The other three applications of Vilas Aurangabadkar, Prabhakar Kulkarni and Madhukar Zende have been accepted,” said   officer Madhav Bhanage. 
 
 Now, the three persons in the fray for the post are from the same panel led by reigning president Vilas Aurangabadkar. This means, two of them will withdraw the forms by March 19. This will ensure that the ruling president will be in the same post. This may invite major unrest in the panel, which was being formed by the local artists and authors. 
 
 The election officer accepted 7 applications for the post of vice-president, and 79 for 15 posts of executive members. Interestingly, Gaidhani’s application for the post of member has been accepted but his application for the president’s post has been rejected. 
 
 Gaidhani said he will raise objection over the list on March 18, which is going to be the last day to raise objection or withdraw applications. 
 
 On March 15, the Bombay   ordered the suspended executives of the Public Library ( ) to appeal to he office of the charity commissioner, Nashik and directed the officer to resolve their issue within 15 days.

 While the court has directed the charity commissioner to give verdict on the issue in 15 days, it denied to stay the ongoing election process.
