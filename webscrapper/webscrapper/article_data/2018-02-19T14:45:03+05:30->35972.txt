COIMBATORE: With the   planning to bring them under the   in accordance with a  , all railway stations in the city will soon get smart.

 The stations will get a facelift in line with airports. “Just like airports, the railway stations will have separate arrivals and departure centres. Security will get an extra thrust. All the stations will have waiting rooms and accommodation facilities. Lounges will also be set up and the train information system will be digitised,” said a corporation official.
 
 However, a final list will be prepared after smart city consultants conduct a discussion with the railway department. “We need to clarify about the funding. We are not aware whether stations coming under the area based development (ABD) alone will be taken up or it will be a pan-city initiative. The government of India had said that the railway stations will be developed under the smart city by corporations after discussions with the railway department,” said the official.
 
 The main areas of infrastructure development will be to manage parking and provide transit-oriented solutions for passengers. “We will ensure the end-to-end connectivity to ease traffic congestion,” the official said.
 
  “Currently, the stations here have minimal infrastructure such as benches, lights, parking facility and information counters. They will be developed just like the airports in the country and have all amenities,” he told TOI.
 
 “A detailed report will be prepared and submitted to the railways department. After their approval, the projects will be sent for the state government’s approval,” he added.
