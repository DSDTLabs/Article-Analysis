NEW DELHI: A 40-year-old inspector of Delhi Police allegedly shot himself with his service pistol at the   police station. 

 Kaushal Gangoly, posted with the district investigation unit in southeast Delhi, was taken to a private hospital in Saket where he was declared dead on arrival. No suicide note has been found yet. 
 
 The police suspect that depression could have led him to take this extreme step, but the possibility of failure to cope with work pressure has also not been ruled out. 
 
 Gangoly, who had joined the unit a few months ago, was charged with following up on four pending cases and conduct inquiries into the status of some old cases. He also had to appear before the court from time to time as part of his duty.
 
 Gangoly reached the police station around 4.30pm and got a pistol in his name after some time, claiming that he had Shab-e-Barat duties. 
 
 He then went to his office on the first floor. Around 6pm, he entered the washroom, locked it and shot himself in the head.
 
 According to police officers, Gangoly came to office despite it being a holiday and chatted with another inspector for nearly an hour before asking for the pistol. 
 
 “He had told his colleagues that he was unable to gauge the gravity of his work and was depressed over it,” said an officer. 
 
 Sources said he had returned from a leave a few days ago and started keeping to himself after meeting some of his superiors regarding some work. He had even sought a transfer.
 
 His wife, who works as a nurse with  , was informed about the incident by his colleagues.
 
 Gangoly was staying with his wife and two children at the police quarters in south Delhi’s Arjun Nagar. Recruited in 1997, Gangoly was earlier posted with the Delhi Police PRO as a sub-inspector and the special staff wing in east Delhi. 
 
 “Efforts are being made to find out the reason behind this extreme step,” said DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya.
