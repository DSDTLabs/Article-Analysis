NEW DELHI: The combined opposition, led by  , visited the EC on Thursday to reiterate the demand that the Budget be postponed till the end of elections in five states starting February. They urged the EC to issue a direction to the Centre that the Budget be put off from February 1to the culmination of the poll process on March 8.

 Punjab and Goa will go to polls on February 4 and the last phase of voting in UP and   will be held on March 8 Among those to meet chief election commissioner   were members of Congress, JD(U), BSP, SP, DMK and RJD. The meeting came weeks after the opposition bloc shot off letters to the President and CEC, urging that the Budget should not be allowed to be tabled during state polls. It was argued that the Budget would give BJP an unfair advan tage. TOI reported it first on December 16.
 
 “When the opposition had objected to the Budget in 2012 during the assembly polls to these five states, Congress had accepted their stand and postponed the presentation from February 28 to March 16. We want that there should be no presentation of the Budget till the elec tions are over,“ leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha   told re porters after meeting the CEC. The de legation included TMC's  , BSP's Ambeth Rajan, Naresh Agarwal of SP, T Siva of DMK and JD(U)'s KC Tyagi.
 
 The show is significant for trying to d paint that a nervous BJP is eager to milk the Budget politically by advancing it from February 28 to February 1. Also, the coming together of the opposition holds significance beyond the immediate concern. It shows that antiBJP unity may be reviving after falling apart on the last day of the winter session of Parliament.
