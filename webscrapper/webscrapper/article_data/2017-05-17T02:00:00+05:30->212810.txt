PATNA: A wholesale onion trader, Pappu Gope alias Pappu Yadav, was shot dead by two unidentified bike-borne criminals near his residence at Fatuha Bazaar, on the outskirts of Patna, on Tuesday. 

 The 44-year-old had unsuccessfully contested the legislative council election few years back as a nominee of the  , an ally in the grand alliance government of Bihar.
 
 Police said the incident took place around 5.15am when Pappu left home for a morning walk. He had barely gone 200 metres away when the assailants accosted him from behind and fired at his head from the right side from point-blank range. He died instantly while the killer duo sped away.
 
 Fatuha police station SHO Sujeet Kumar said only one shot was fired. “Police did not recover any empty cartridge from the spot,” he said.
 
 “A big onion businessman with supply network in neighbouring districts, Pappu has a multi-storey house at Fatuha Bazaar where he lived with his wife and mother. His two children are studying outside Bihar,” the SHO said.
 
 Pappu’s body was handed over to his family after postmortem at the Nalanda Medical College & Hospital in Patna. His supporters later blocked the Patna-Bakhtiarpur four-lane road with the body and also pelted police personnel with stones.
 
 Police said pictures of the two criminals fleeing on the bike were captured in a CCTV installed nearby. “Raids are on to nab the killers. We have got clues which suggest the killing was a result of a property dispute,” Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said, adding the SHO was suspended following complaints by locals about inadequate police patrolling in the area.
