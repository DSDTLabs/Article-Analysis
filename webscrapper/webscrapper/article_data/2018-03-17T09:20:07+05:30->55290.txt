AHMEDABAD: Witnessing yet another failed marriage that was arranged through matrimonial websites,   high court has commented that a public interest litigation (PIL) should be filed against such websites.

 Justice   commented so when a woman, all in tears, told the court that her marriage with her husband was an arranged one and it was fixed through a matrimonial website. Earlier also, when it came across a case of marital discord where the couple had come into contact of each other on a social media platform, the high court had observed that marriages fixed on   are bound to fail.
 
 After hearing about the details of seemingly irretrievable breakdown of marriage between the couple, the judge said, “The world is really cruel and we are passing through a very bad time. We don’t know what is there is store for the next generation in future.”
 
 This particular complaint was filed in   police station in January by a woman, who is from Mumbai and married to a man in Ahmedabad. The wife filed a complaint of domestic violence against the in-laws and the husband and left the matrimonial home. The couple has got a three-year-old child.
 
 When the husband and his family members approached the HC for quashing of charges, the HC asked the woman to remain present in court to urge a compromise between the parties. The woman appeared in court earlier this week after a couple of reminders from the HC to attend the proceedings.
 
 When the judge asked the woman and her family members whether they saw any possibility of settlement, they replied in the negative. After hearing complaints from both the parties, the court suggested them to resolve their disputes through discussion instead of involving police in the matter. The court stayed police from taking any coercive action in this case, but allowed investigation to go ahead.
