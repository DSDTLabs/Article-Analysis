NAGPUR: A murder-convicted man, who was released from jail six months back, raped his 13-year-old daughter while she was sleeping with her younger sister at their place in   on Saturday. 36-year-old Gaurishankar Kolte’s wife was not at home and was expected to return late.

 The survivor, a standard VI student, shared her grievance with her mother who then approached Sakkardara police station on Sunday. Cops registered the offence of   under The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. 
 
 Kolte, who works as a driver of a private water tanker, was arrested and produced before the court which remanded him to PCR for two days on Monday. The minor too underwent medical examination at the   (GMCH).
 
 “Kolte was in jail earlier for killing his sister-in-law in Pachpaoli for which he was sent to jail for five years. Six months back he was released from jail and directly went to his wife’s place, but she was reluctant to take him in. But, later, she forgave him and allowed him to stay,” investigating officer   told TOI.
 
 The survivor’s mother informed cops that Kolte returned home early on Saturday. Seeing his daughters alone at home, he touched the elder daughter inappropriately. As he was about to force himself upon her, she pushed him away. But Kolte, who was not drunk, continued to exploit her.
 
 Cops said the shocked mother fell unconscious while narrating the incident. She couldn’t believe her husband had raped their own daughter. 
 
 Cops added she didn’t want to register a case but was afraid that Kolte would do the same with their younger daughter and hence she reported the matter.
