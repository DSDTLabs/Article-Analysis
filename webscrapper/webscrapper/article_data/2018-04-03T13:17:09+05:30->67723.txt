RAJKOT: The city may get a new district court complex if the government is able to convince the lawyers to shift the courts to the city’s outskirts. 

 Rajkot district collector has proposed to provide land for the new district court complex, but the procedure will be completed only after consultation with the bar association. The state government is ready to provide nearly 50,000 sqmt land for the new building.
 
 The current building of the district court is nearly 40 years old and is located in the very congested   area where parking is a major issue. Also, the court rooms are small and the library doesn’t have sufficient space. 
 
 Water leakages from the ceiling during monsoon and water logging in the area cause lot of discomfort for litigants.   had in the past proposed to provide land for the new district court near Kankot engineering college beyond the new ring road.
 
 However, the district bar association did not accept the proposal. Anil Desai, president of   said, “It is good that government is interested in providing land for the new building, but we want court inside the city area. We have to consult our members and after that we can decide the place.”
