IDUKKI: Carrot costs Rs 30-40/kg in Ernakulam, but the farmers at Kanthalloor in the district are getting only Rs 3-8/kg, prompting them not to harvest this season's crop.Many farmers are shying away from cultivating carrots this season, a fearing steep fall in prices. Cabbages are no better, as the price offered is Rs 5-6/kg. 

 During his recent visit, minister for agriculture VS   had promised that state-owned   would procure vegetables directly from farmers' societies. But it was not a smooth affair.
 
 Vattavada Winter Vegetable Farmers' Society and Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Society (VFPCK) now owe farmers Rs 24 lakh and Rs 17 lakh respectively and supply to Horticorp has been stopped due to pending payments.
 
 Farmers often sell their vegetables to   vendors and this, in turn, leads to further exploitation. Last year, the farmers had got Rs 23-25/kg for carrots during the same time.
 
 "We face a serious crisis in marketing perishable agricultural products and have no other option than stopping carrot harvest altogether. The harvesting expenses will exceed the price we receive for the produce. Horticorp's pending payments have put us in real trouble and hopefully, it will clear the dues in at the earliest," said  , president of Vattavada Winter Vegetable Farmers' Society.
