News is that Salman has parted ways with Matrix, the agency that has been managing him for 9 long years. His brother Sohail, who recently helmed the film ‘Freaky Ali’, will be managing his endorsements, film deals and PR activities henceforth. To begin with, Sohail will spearhead Da-Bang concert tour that will see the likes of

  on-stage. 

 Salman’s family used to manage his business arrangements before he signed up with the agency. Though the agency will continue to service ongoing contracts as well as conclude deals that are at an advanced stage of negotiation, everything else will reportedly be managed in-house by the Khans. 
 
 Apart from producing movies and ads in-house, Salman is now working on launching his own brand of e-bicycles and gym equipment.
