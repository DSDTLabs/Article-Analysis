Barring the fine of Rs 12 lakh levied on   captain   for slow over-rates, most of the other matches or captains this edition haven’t faced the ire of the tournament’s technical committee for the amount of time taken to conclude an innings.

 
  matches regularly ending between 11:45 pm and past midnight are taking a toll on multiple stakeholders in the game, an issue that   hasn’t taken cognizance of as yet. International Cricket Council ( ) rules stipulate that a T20I innings should consume not more than 75 minutes of play time.
 
 
 
 The IPL organisers would do well to take into account that matches this season – beginning at 8 pm IST – are taking close to four hours to conclude.
 
 Those in the know of things say: “Viewership is getting hugely affected but that’s secondary. The primary thing is that the overall interest is taking a beating because of the late hours”.
