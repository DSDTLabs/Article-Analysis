MANGALURU: The department of pediatrics,  , held the first of its kind   in   school recently. The clinic was conducted with an aim to teach young children about different procedures they undergo in hospitals, by using teddy bears to demonstrate such procedures. 

 Children brought their own teddy bears to school, and doctors demonstrated medical procedures to them on the teddy bears, so as to remove any anxiety related to medical procedures among children.
 
 Dr Jeedhu Radhakrishnan from   said: “This is a unique practice adopted for children called the teddy bear clinic. Through this clinic, we try to remove anxiety associated with medical procedures among children. Most of the time, children are usually afraid of hospitals and medical procedures, therefore this is a unique way through which we can spread awareness about the same, and at the same time remove any myths or anxiety associated with medical procedures.”
 
 Dr Sowmini Kamath, pediatrician, KMC Hospitals said: “The session was extremely helpful for the children. Initially, they were a bit hesitant, but when we involved them in checking blood pressure or temperature, they were very forthcoming and enthusiastic. Both children and parents were excited at the initiative. All of them came with their favourite set of teddy bears.”
