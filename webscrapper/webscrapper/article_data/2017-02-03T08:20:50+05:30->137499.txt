LUCKNOW: More than a week after gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari joined the BSP, criminal-turned-politician and former BSP MP   joined the   led Rashtriya Lok Dal on Thursday. 

 Yadav, who joined the party in the presence of Ajit Singh in New Delhi was appointed immediately the party national general secretary. Umakant shot to limelight in 2007 when former UP chief minister and BSP boss   got him arrested from her residence on charges of land grabbing and intimidating people.
 
  spokesperson Anil Dubey confirmed that Yadav has joined the party and that his son, Dinesh Yadav has been given a ticket from Shahganj assembly constituency in the forthcoming assembly elections. Umakant’s brother, Ramakant is in the BJP and had contested 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Azamgarh, losing to SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav.
 
 Umakant became an MLA from Khutahan assembly constituency in Azamgarh for the first time in 1991 on BSP ticket. He was re-elected from the same seat in 1993 when BSP entered into an alliance with SP. But when the BSP broke the alliance with SP in 1996, he sided with SP and got elected once again. He later joined the BJP in 2002 but lost the seat to BSP’s Shailendra Yadav. In 2004, he returned to BSP and won the Machhlishahar parliamentary seat defeating BJP’s Keshri Nath Tripathi.
