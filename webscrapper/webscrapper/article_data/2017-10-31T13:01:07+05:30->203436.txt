 VSSC is Isro's centre for making various types of rockets like the Polar   Launch Vehicle and the Reusable Launch Vehicle.

  Isro said vehicles using fossil fuels cause problems to environment and life. "An ideal transportation system should envisage zero emission without any pollution," it said. 
 
  
  
 The car is run using high-energy lithium ion batteries, which can be recharged using sunlight, said sources. The main challenges in developing the vehicle included designing a solar panel on top of the car and also control electronics for the battery and solar panel interface and, what is known as, "drive electronic" to run the car smoothly.
