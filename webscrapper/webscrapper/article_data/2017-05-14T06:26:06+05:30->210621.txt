NEW DELHI: Hundreds of war veterans, students and tourists gathered at   on Saturday evening to pay homage to Lt  , who was abducted and killed by terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir recently. 

 There was a sense of grief and outrage among the people, including serving Army officers, who turned up for the   vigil. Even those who had come for an evening stroll at the war memorial joined the march. They raised slogans hailing the “sacrifice” of the young Army officer. “Bharat Mata ki Jai” rent the air, along with cries condemning Pakistan and militant groups in the Valley.
 
 “The murder of Ummer has taken their so-called movement to a new low. He was killed only because he belonged to the Army. He could have been a role model for other youth in Kashmir,” said Lt Gen Satish Dua, a counter-terrorism specialist who played a key role in planning the much-talked about surgical strike in PoK. “This is a murder. He was not in an operation but spending time with his family. They (terrorists) only wanted to send a message.” 
 
  “J&K is and will remain a part of India. If they think they will get away with a murder like this, then it is their misconception. We will fight back. We must try and declare Pakistan as a terrorist state,” said Lt   (retired). There were chants of “Indian Army, zindabad” in the background.
 
 Lt Fayaz, from the troubled region of Kulgam district, was posted with 2 Rajputana Rifles and had applied for leave to attend a cousin’s wedding.
 
 He was on leave when he was picked up from his house at Harmein in Kulgam, 60 kilometres from Srinagar, on Tuesday. The body of the young officer was later found three kilometres from his house.
