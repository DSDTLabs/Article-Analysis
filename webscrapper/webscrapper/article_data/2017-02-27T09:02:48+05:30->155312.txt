TRICHY: In a classic example of public money going waste, the district   in Trichy is functioning from a private building at   for a rent of Rs 45,000 per month, despite having its own building near the corporation office at   ready for the past one year. 

 The new building was constructed at a cost of Rs 1.5crore in February 2016. However, it could not be inaugurated for want of appointment from then chief minister late J Jayalalithaa. Ironically, Jayalalithaa had inaugurated a ‘Teachers Home’ constructed on the same campus through video conferencing in July 2016.
 
 “It is a clear case of official apathy in Chennai to take steps for the inauguration. The building could have been inaugurated by then chief minister Jayalalithaa in July 2016 itself and the unnecessary payment of rental for the existing office in Mannarpuram could have been avoided,” said an official requesting anonymity. 
 
 The construction of the new building at Ko Abhishekapuram was necessitated following relentless demand by the employees and visitors for the office to be relocated to an easily accessible location in the city. 
 
 The labour and employment department of Tamil Nadu then sanctioned the project to construct an own building on the campus of   at   in 2013. However, the proposal did not go down well with the employees as the site of the office was located far away from the city limits and people, especially those from rural areas, would be severely inconvenienced.
 
 Following this, the district administration identified the spot at Ko Abhishekapuram in 2014. Construction work commenced in January 2015 for the single-storey building which has several facilities, including rooms for registrations, classrooms for free coaching for competitive exams and a model career counseling (MCC) centre.
