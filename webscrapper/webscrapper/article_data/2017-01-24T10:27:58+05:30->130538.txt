 star   and TV actress   got hitched in a hush hush wedding ceremony on August 16 last year and the two are absolutely enjoying the marital bliss.
 
  The much-in-love couple rang the wedding bells yet again in a crazy style.
  
  Last year, the couple got hitched in a court marriage due to Megha's father sudden demise. So to make that up, the two decided to marry yet again.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  Megha entered the 'shaadi' on a bullet in a badass way, she looked absolutely gorgeous in her orange lehenga. Siddhant color coordinated with Megha and sported an orange Nehru jacket along with white kurta.
  
  
  
  
  
  It was a lavish affair with all Punjabi rituals, pheras and a crazy baaraat.
  
  
  
  
  Well, we suppose the super fun duo is all set for their second honeymoon already.
