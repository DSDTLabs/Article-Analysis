KARUR:   in   districts have demanded the state government to immediately pay the Rs 300 crore dues pending towards enrolling students under the Right to Education ( ) Act. 

 President of   Nursery, Primary, Matriculation and Matric Higher Secondary School Management Association K R Nandha Kumar said in Karur that “unless the government makes the payment that is pending, admissions under RTE would not be made this year.” A meeting of private school correspondents from Karur district was held on Thursday. 
 
 The state government had mentioned RTE fund in its budget and also allocated Rs 175.78 crore for the same. However, the disbursal of funds continues to be delayed by the state government. 
 
 “About 3 lakh students have been enrolled under RTE across 14,000 schools in the last two academic years. But the government chose not to allocate funds in these two years and now the dues are estimated to be over Rs 300 crore,” said Nandha Kumar.
 
 He said that the schools have received only Rs 98 Crore as one time allocation in the past three years towards RTE admissions. 
 
 With many schools finding it difficult to give salaries to teachers for want of funds, Nandha Kumar said, it has become a ritual to seek RTE funds from the state government every year. “We want to make it clear that schools would not be in a position to enrol students under RTE if the government fails to disburse pending funds,” he said, 
 
 It was also resolved in the meeting to urge the government to renew recognition to private nursery and primary schools which have been pending for the past few years. “Permanent recognition to schools which are over 10 years old too have been pending,” said Nandha Kumar.
