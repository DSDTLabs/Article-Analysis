 Speaking to reporters after his victory, Vishal said, "The faith that you have reposed will not go in vain... Historic things will happen... No one can stop the change and our work will be a golden era for the Producers' council."
 
 "First, we will try to do something for farmers and then move on to fulfill the representations of producers," he said.
 
 He further said the new team of office-bearers would work for elimination of piracy of new movies. Vishal, who has a production house,  , was suspended by the council, in November last, for allegedly criticising the functioning of some of its office-bearers.
 
 Subsequently, the actor moved the Madras High Court challenging the suspension order, which was rescinded by the council after he apologised for his purported remarks.
