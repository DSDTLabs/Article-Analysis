BIJANBARI: The   (GJM) has issued a veiled threat to the state government by saying that it will not be responsible for the situation in the Hills if any of its 23 accused leaders is arrested when they go to Kolkata to attend the hearing in the Madan Tamang murder case.

 Though the party has not yet decided what it will do on July 24, it tried to create pressure on the state and build a defence for itself by shifting the onus on the administration.
 
 In its first official reaction to the Calcutta high court's order on Wednesday , Morcha's assistant general secretary Binay Tamang, who is also one of the main accused in the Madan Tamang murder case along with Morcha chief Bimal Gurung, told TOI that the turmoil in the Hills may worsen if its leaders are arrested. Till now eight people have lost their lives in numerous instances of violence in Darjeeling since last month. The indefinite strike entered its 36th day on Thursday .
 
 “We are waiting for the advice of our legal counsels. But, if any of our leaders is arrested when they go to Kolkata, the state will be responsible for the consequences in the Hills. The Hill people are already angry,“ said Tamang. Madan Tamang, whose party ABGL is a constituent of the Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee headed by the GJM, was stabbed to death in broad daylight in the Mall area in 2010.
 
 The court on Wednesday directed GJM president Bimal Gurung and 22 others, charged by the CBI for the murder of Madan Tamang, to be present in a city court on July 24 when the case is heard next.
 
 While the threat of arrest is a real worry , the GJM top brass also does not want the leadership to be handed over to some other entity . Nor is it keen to lose grip over the protest after wi de-scale condemnation that the GJM -like the administration --has failed to stop arson in the Hills in the past one week. There is also some confusion if the co-ordination committee of all parties will be asked to step in for a brief period.
