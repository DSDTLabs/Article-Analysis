Bharuch: A 45-year-old woman was dragged by a crocodile deep into the Narmada river and killed near Bhalod village in Bharuch district on Saturday. The incident happened at around 6.30am and the woman’s body was found six hours later from the river. Daxaben Kanubhai Tevar was bathing in the river when the crocodile attacked her and dragged her into the deep waters. Soon villagers started a search operation for Tevar. Local people and the district rescue team were able to locate Tevar’s body only after six hours.  Ashish Sharma, an animal activist, said, “Most of the crocodile attacks take place between March and June because it is nesting season for them. Female crocodiles lay eggs and build a nest over them. And if they see anyone close to their nest, they become aggressive. Warning boards need to be put on the banks of Narmada for the benefit of villagers. There is need to launch a mass awareness campaign in the villages along the river banks by the forest department.”
