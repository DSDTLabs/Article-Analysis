Actress   said she is a miser when it comes to picking up bar bills. The 21-year-old actress enjoys visiting her school- friends at their universities, but does not like paying for bar tabs for everyone when they get together.

  
  
 "I'm actually such a cheapskate, but all my friends are cool about it. We take turns getting rounds, I'm not an expensive person. I will go to Topshop, or get a one-pound vodbull (vodka and  )," said Turner. 
 
 The 'Games of Thrones' star said it is good to revisit her old haunts, where people treat her like a normal person and not a celebrity.
