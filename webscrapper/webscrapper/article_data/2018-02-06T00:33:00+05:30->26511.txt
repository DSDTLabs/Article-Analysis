Madurai: The scene of Meenakshi Amman’s celestial wedding comes to life in a large wall at the air-conditioned waiting hall of the Madurai railway junction. In this painting Lord Perumal offers the hand of his sister Meenakshi to Lord Sundareswarar with other deities in attendance. The ceremony is the major event of Chithirai festival which Madurai celebrates every year. This iconic picture will be one among the pieces that are going to come up as a part of Madurai railway division’s efforts to beautify the junction.

 Madurai railway junction is the gateway to the city, which is considered as the pilgrim city of southern Tamil Nadu. The junction has a footfall of over 70,000 a day, in which most of them are from North India and as well as foreigners.
 
 Madurai Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), Neenu Ittyerah during an interaction with businessmen during executive committee meeting of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry held on January 1 this year, sought sponsors to take out art works in the city.
 
 In addition to beautifying the station premises, it will be an opportunity to provide a platform to gifted artists from the locality to display their work. The division also plans to display sculptures and other art works at the station premises, she said.
 
 In a recent interaction, the DRM said that they have found local sponsors. Thigarajar College of Engineering has sponsored the celestial wedding painting while Apollo Hospitals in Madurai has sponsored the huge art work at the escalator wall in platform number 2. The sculpture exhibits have not come up so far, but there are plans to display the artworks of railway school students for the time being.
 
 In a similar manner, paintings will also come up in major stations of the division. “We are working on the project, roping in local sponsors and plans are there to beautify major stations in Madurai Railway Division”, she said.
