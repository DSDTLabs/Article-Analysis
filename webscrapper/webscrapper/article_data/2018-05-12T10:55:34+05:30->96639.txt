CHANDIGARH: Three policemen have been booked for murder after a man arrested for alleged peddling drugs, died in custody in Karnal late on Thursday night. The 55-year-old man, identified as   Singh, died within an hour of being put in the city police station lock-up. He belonged to the nomadic Deha community. 

 Police officials claimed that after Jaleb was put in the lock-up, he complained the chest pain and was rushed to Karnal civil hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Agitated members of his community, however, accused the cops of torturing him which led to his death.
 
 Of the three cops who have been booked, Pradeep Kumar and   are head constables, while Gurjant Singh is a home guards volunteer. 
 
 Some 30-odd Deha community members, including Jaleb's relatives, rioted at the police station on Friday morning when they came to know about the death.
 
 
 
 
 
 Deha community members damaged vehicles, including the SHO's van, and broke office furniture. This went on for almost an hour until Ghraunda DSP Virender Saini reached the spot and controlled the mob. 
 
 SP Surender Singh Bhoria said, "The accused policemen have been shifted out. We are now waiting for the inquest report as well as the postmortem report to ascertain the exact cause of death," he said. 
 
 And he added, "The allegations of torture are baseless as Jaleb's community men as well as family members had accompanied him at the time of his arrest. All this happened within minutes."
 
 Police officials claim Jaleb was a petty criminal and there was information that he was about to supply marijuana to a contact. Acting on the tip-off, a police party caught him and found 150 grams of marijuana on him.
