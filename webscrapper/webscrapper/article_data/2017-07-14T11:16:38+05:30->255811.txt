 has marked his return to experimental cinema with ‘Kaalakaandi’, as he collaborates with the writer of the zany ‘Delhi Belly’ – Akshat Verma. Earlier yesterday, a first look still of the film made its way online, and later in the day, it was followed up with a teaser. ‘Kaalakaandi’ is a thrilling dark comedy written and directed by   and produced by Cinestaan Film Company and Flying Unicorn Entertainment.

  
  
 In the 37-second-long video, Saif’s character traverses through the underbelly of an urban Mumbai. The previously released stills of Saif driving a car with a panicked look on his face, and him sporting a mustard fur coat on top of his white shirt, also find a place in the teaser. As he zooms through the night, Saif comes across an eclectic bunch of interesting characters, that tell a story of how vivid Mumbai’s nightlife. 
 
 Saif had earlier described the film as “very intelligent” and made on a shoestring budget in an interview. He said, “It is a very intelligent and a very nice film made at a small budget and hence can be happily made commercial. It is a story about three people of different strata that run across Mumbai. It is the filmy underworld, by that I mean these two underworld boys - played by   and  , who are involved with the underworld and speak that language. So they have shot that story in a particular way and light. And then they have shot middle-class Mumbai and then a slightly upper-middle-class Mumbai. We are speaking Hindi, Marathi, English... So it is a smattering of what Mumbai is. I am very proud of that.” 
 
 ‘Kaalakaandi’ releases on September 8, 2017. The film also features Sobhita Dhulipala, Kunaal Roy Kapur, Akshay Oberoi and Isha Talwar in other prominent roles, alongside the previously mentioned Vijay Raaz and Deepak Dobriyal.
