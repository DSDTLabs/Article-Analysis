LUCKNOW: While the   is all set to accord Governor   the new protocol system when he arrives in the assembly for a joint session on Monday, a belligerent   is likely to disrupt his address.

 The government is set to table the GST Bill on Monday itself after the address of the governor. 
 
 In the business advisory committee headed by Dixit and the all-party meeting invited by him and attended by the chief minister, parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna and other leaders of the Opposition, it had been unanimously decided that the   should run peacefully and the governorâ€™s address not be disturbed. However, the belligerent mood in the   and the Bahujan Samaj Party ranks indicates a repeat of the acrimonious scenes of the past when the agitated Opposition did not allow the governor to read his full speech and he had to leave amid pandemonium.
 
 The new protocol has been directed by President Pranab Mukherjee for all governors addressing the joint session of the assembly. 
 
 To address the House in a peaceful manner, Naik had even called the leader of the Samajwadi Party legislature party Akhilesh Yadav and discussed the issue with him. Akhilesh had assured Naik of all support. However, the mood at the SP legislature party was different and MLAs were in a mood to oppose the government vociferously and aggressively.
 
 The Speaker confirmed to TOI that for the first time protocol as desired by the office of the President will be extended to governor Ram Naik when he reaches the assembly around 11am.
 
 Both the Speaker and the chief minister will receive the governor at the portico where he will be accorded a guard of honour and a national salute. Naik will then be taken to the second floor. A procession led by the Governor will then be formed and a bugle will be sounded.
