   decorates his house and dresses in traditional Marathi clothes for Gudi Padwa celebrations at home. Madhuri comes outside all decked up in jewellery, wearing a nauvari sari. Their daughter Sonu also wears a Nauvari sari and they pray together.
 
  When Bhide and Madhuri are about to leave for the temple, Sonu stops them from leaving and asks them to call their friend Kulkarni. They sit together and wish Kulkarni on the occasion of Gudi Padwa. They call other relatives as well and take blessings from them. They miss being with their relatives in the village as they celebrate it just amongst themselves in Gokuldham. Bhide starts complaining that no one even remembers about the function in their society.
  
  They hear drums and trumpets from compound and get excited to see what's going on outside. They go out and see everyone dressed up in Marathi style, wishing them Gudi Padwa. Bhide gets emotional on seeing all this.
  
  
 
  
  Bhide and Madhuri thank everyone and share their excitement.
  
  Later, everyone tells Bhide that it was Popatlal's idea to give this wonderful surprise to them and that he took help of Tappu sena in organising everything. Popatlal apologises for not taking permission from Bhide.
  
  There is dhol, songs and dance in the compound after that.
