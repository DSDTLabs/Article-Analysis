CHANDIGARH: Cricketer-turned-politician   and outgoing Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal’s nephew   will be among the eight Congress MLAs who will take oath as ministers along with   on Thursday. 

 There will be two women in the cabinet of the 75-year-old scion of the erstwhile Patiala royalty.
 
 Congress is still maintaining a studied silence on giving deputy CM’s post to Sidhu.
 
 Buoyed by its unexpected performance in the Malwa region, where Congress won 40 out of 69 seats, four of the region’s MLAs — Manpreet Badal, Razia Sultana, Charanjit Channi and Brahm Mohindra — have made it to the list of ministers. 
 
 The Majha region will have a fair share of representation with Amarinder confidante Tripat Bajwa and Dina Nagar MLA Aruna Chouhdary getting berths.
