Kannada television is getting more entertaining by the day and there’s never a dull week. Audiences are constantly treated to interesting content and now they’ve come to expect the unexpected on their favourite TV shows. Soon, they’ll be in for one of the biggest coups on TV as they witness two of Sandalwood’s biggest names —   and   — on a talk show hosted by the latter. We hear that it was one rocking episode filled with a lot of laughs and leg-pulling with Shivarajkumar and Sudeep ganging up to tease director  , who accompanied the star on the show.
Meanwhile Majaa Talkies, which recently returned with a makeover, also saw host   undergoing a look change. We noticed his hair-do has changed. We like. 
 Indrajit Lankesh, the Sidhu of Majaa Talkies, is still chuckling over the memories of dancing with the heroine of Huccha 2,  , in front of her dad   when they were guests on the show. “He can do everything except dancing and refused to shake a leg on the stage. So, I decided to step up as a gentleman and jive with Shravya,” says Indrajit. Also, Avantika Shetty, who appeared on the show, impressed everyone with her dubsmash on  , we hear. “In fact, it was better than Kareena herself,” says a source from the set.
