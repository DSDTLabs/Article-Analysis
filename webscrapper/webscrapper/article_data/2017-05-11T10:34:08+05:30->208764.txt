AGARTALA: The arrest of four   who were carrying $2.3 million in  , worth Rs 1.5 crore in  , from West   on Tuesday has revealed an  . 

 The four Bangladeshi nationals were on their way to Bangladesh and had valid passports. They got here via the Srimantapur checkpost with one more person from Comilla district in Bangladesh, Abdul Manna. 
 
 Acting on a tip-off, BSF 14 battalion jawans detained four of them - identified as Abul Kalam Azad (37), Muhammad Ali (37), Sajibur Rahaman (42) and Parimal Saha (36), all of them from Comilla as well. 
 
 According to BSF, the five persons had recorded their destination at a city hotel and were given traveller's visa.
 
 During interrogation, they revealed that they were paid employees of a Dhaka-based money laundering company Leon Sunny Exchange, owned by one Nizmuddin. 
 
 They said they worked on a monthly salary of 15,000 Bangladeshi taka. They admitted to being engaged in money laundering activities since January and said they knew nothing about the final destination of the money. 
 
 They had drawn the money from one Somnath Dotra of Kolkata and were carrying them for their employer in Dhaka.
 
 They could not, however, be handed over to police due to procedural difficulty. On Wednesday, customs took them into custody and may produce them before the court on Thursday. 
 
 According to reports, they went to Kolkata after crossing the border and flew back here on the same day. It is suspected that their fifth accomplice Abdul Mannan crossed the border from another location.
 
 The intelligent officials are, however, yet to confirm how could they manage airport security in both Kolkata and Agartala while travelling with such a huge stash of cash.
