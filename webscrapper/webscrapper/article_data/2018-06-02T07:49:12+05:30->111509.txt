BENGALURU: Two sisters saved their jeweller-father from armed men and foiled their efforts to loot their shop on Ashoka Pillar Road, Jayanagar, on the night of May 21.

  
  
 
 Undaunted by the knife-wielding intruders, the women, in their late 30s, pushed them out of Sri Chamundeshwari Jewellers in precisely 37 seconds. The siblings’ bravery was captured on   cameras installed in the shop.
 
 Siddapura police said C V Raghu runs the jewellery store on the ground floor of his duplex house a few yards from Ashoka Pillar. Raghu and his elder daughter Vaishnavi were in the shop on the evening of May 21. Around 8.16pm, a stranger entered the shop without leaving his shoes outside or removing his helmet. Raghu asked him to remove his shoes and he stepped out for a minute, only to return with five other men at 8.18pm. All of them wore helmets and handgloves and it appeared to be a well-planned dacoity bid, police said.
 
 The intruders pulled out knives and brandished them at Raghu. Vaishnavi sensed danger and came to her father’s rescue. As Raghu and Vaishnavi tried to drive away the dacoits, Vaibhavi, the jeweller’s second daughter, came down and joined them. Raghu sustained injuries on his fingers while trying to ward off the dacoits’ attacks. Finally, the trio succeeded in pushing out the gang members, who sped away on three bikes. 
 
 Raghu immediately informed Siddapura police about the incident. S D Sharanappa, deputy commissioner of police (south division), said a case has been registered based on Raghu’s complaint and they have formed a special team to nab the gang. Police said going by the CCTV footage, the dacoits were pushed out in 37 seconds.
 
 Raghu said Lord Venkateswara and his daughters saved him from the dacoits. He declined to divulge further details about the incident, citing police instructions. “We didn’t lose anything by the grace of god,” he added.
