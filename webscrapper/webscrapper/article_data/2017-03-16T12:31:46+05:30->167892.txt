RANCHI: When Steven Smith made his Test debut, it was his guile with the ball as a leg-spinner which had brought him into national reckoning. More than half-a-dozen years later and helming Australia's stern, Smith sits pretty at the top of the ICC Test rankings, albeit as a batsman.

 The right-hander is certainly not a purist's delight but he definitely makes up for it with his pugnacious attitude at the crease. Much of Smith's batting revolves around adaptability .
 
 “When we came over to India, we were under no illusions that we were going to potentially get some difficult pitches to play on. And the first two Tests were (played on) pretty tough tracks. I think we've adopted some good plans and played some very good cricket so far in this series. This pitch is no different. So aga in, it's about adapting to what we're dealt with out in the middle and ensuring that we can be in the contest for a long time,“ said the Australian skipper, with a spinner's instinct taking precedence over his judgement.
 
 Having lost the second Test despite being in the driver's seat at one point, Smith realizes the enormity of the challenge that awaits his team at the JSCA International Stadium.
 
 “Playing the game is important, that's what we're here to do. You obviously have to adapt to whatever the pitch is doing. So I don't think forgetting the pitch is probably the right way around it. You need to know what you're likely to expect and play according to what the pitch entails. That's what we talk about playing anywhere around the world.Adapting and making sure we have a game plan in place to be successful,“ Smith opined.
