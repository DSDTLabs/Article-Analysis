MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday directed all high courts to ensure that   are fast-tracked and decided by special courts. The   had also recently emphasized the need for prompt and timely completion of investigations in such cases. 

 This underlines judicial concern and show that crimes against minors are getting the attention needed to ensure proper implementation of the salutary provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, said activists and lawyers. The stringent Act was framed in 2012 to ensure speedy trial, but data compiled by the law ministry shows that pendency of such cases are increasing.
 
 Maharashtra has the worst figures, with as many as 17,300 Pocso cases pending trial; UP has 15,900 and Madhya Pradesh 10,950. Kerala, Odisha, Karnataka, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Gujarat have cases ranging between 3,500 to 5,000 pending.
 
 The apex court bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud also asked that high courts issue instructions to all trial courts to conduct speedy trials without unnecessary adjournments in Pocso cases. It also said the HCs may form a panel of three judges to regulate Pocso case trials.
 
 Women's rights activist and advocate Flavia Agnes, who founded Majlis, said "there is quite a large backlog of cases under Pocso". After a chargesheet is filed in a case, it takes up to three years or more till the trial is over and verdict pronounced, said Agnes. She wondered whether the proposed will panel have to monitor each Pocso case.
 
 The Bombay HC had recently expressed concern also at the tardy pace of police probe in Pocso cases. Last week, it suggested setting up of a special police unit to probe offences against women and minors on a "priority basis''.
