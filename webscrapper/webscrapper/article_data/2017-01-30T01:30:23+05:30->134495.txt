NAVI MUMBAI: The civic body has put up an iron fencing to curb   in a mangrove stretch and a storm water nullah along Patni road in Airoli’s sector 19 and 20. 

 The debris mafia were dumping construction waste because of the absence of CCTVs or  . 
 
 The locals have welcome the move as miscreants from both Navi Mumbai and Thane have been reportedly dumping debris in this area. 
 
  TOI has repeatedly highlighted the killing of mangroves and choking of the storm water nullah in this stretch. 
 
 “Just fencing a small portion will not help protect the green cover. The entire 2km stretch from Airoli’s sector 19 to Patni ground should be fenced to stop debris mafia from across Mumbai Metropolitan Region,” said  , an activist.
 
    executive engineer   said, “We are going to cover the area under our jurisdiction. The forest department will take care of the remaining portion. A 500m stretch along the storm water nullah is also under our control.” 
 
 The civic body should have first removed the existing debris before laying the fence as the construction rubble will again choke the nullah,a resident said.
 
 “Fencing of this 500m patch is a temporary arrangement. We are charting out a plan to put up a concrete boundary to protect the area behind the nullah from being encroached by slums and debris mafia,” Desai said.
