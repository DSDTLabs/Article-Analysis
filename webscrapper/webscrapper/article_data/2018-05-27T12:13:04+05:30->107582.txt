 "An English journalist brought the matter to the notice of Peter Oshay who was unaware of what the ICC regulations say about using a smart watch on the field," one report said.
 
 Due to rising incidents of corruption in international cricket, the ICC has now even stopped umpires, trainers and team officials from using smartwatches during matches on the ground. The report said that the ICC headquarters got in touch with its Anti-corruption officer updated him, after which he reprimanded the two Pakistani players for wearing the device on the field.
