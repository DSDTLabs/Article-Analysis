 The main accused Siddik Ismail Pathan and four others were booked for damage to   and under section 15 (2) of Indian Minerals Pipeline Act.
 
 According to police the accused used to drill a hole in the pipeline through which the diesel passes at high pressure. They used rubber tubes to control the flow of liquid and fill it into carboys. Since the pipeline is in the sea, the accused used a boat to reach the pipeline after dark and drill a hole in it. After filling the carboys they would return to shore and sell the diesel to truckers and small cargo vessel owners or fishermen, said police.
 
 On Friday, when the police raided Khari Rohar area following information of diesel theft from pipeline, Pathan and others left the filled carboys and escaped in the sea taking advantage of the dark. Police seized the containers and diesel and lodged FIR against Pathan and four others.
