 "Happy people don't make great art, it's that simple. Great art comes from a place of pain and I don't really have any more pain. My life worked out unbelievably, so for a while, I struggled. I stepped away for three years and thought, 'I guess I shouldn't make movies anymore.' After 'Red State', I was like, 'I'll go podcast.' Then oddly, the podcast brought me back to movies, everything that's in 'Tusk' and 'Yoga Hosers' came out of episodes of that," Smith said.
