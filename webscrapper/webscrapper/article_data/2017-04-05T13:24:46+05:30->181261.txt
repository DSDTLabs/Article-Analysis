Pune: The Kothrud police on Sunday arrested a househelp for allegedly staging a false theft and stealing gold ornaments worth Rs4.39 lakh at the residence of an elderly man, where she was employed. 

 The elderly man’s son-in-law,   (64) of Kothrud, lodged a police complaint after the caretaker informed him about the theft.
 
 A police team comprising senior inspector Raghunath Phuge, inspector Shankar Khatake and sub-inspector Shashikant Dendge visited the spot, but did not find anything indicating a theft.
 
 The caretaker,   (38) from Mayur Colony, said three unidentified persons barged into the apartment around 5.30am.
 
 She was sleeping in the front room, while the owner   (87) and his wife were asleep in the bedroom. She claimed the noise woke her up, but the suspects grabbed her by the neck and threatened to throw powder in her eyes, before fleeing with the ornaments.
 
 “We inspected the spot and questioned their neighbours. We realized there was something fishy in the theft and Pawar’s statement. Spot inspection revealed the said theft never took place. The cupboard was not broken into and it did not look like a crime scene,” Dendge said.
 
 “When we started interrogating Pawar, she burst into tears. She confessed to have stolen the ornaments when the elderly couple was asleep,” Dendge said.
