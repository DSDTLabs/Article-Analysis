INDORE: For the first time in the  , the forest department along with an NGO organised a   in a wildlife sanctuary to create a baseline data of   seen there.

  The survey was carried out at the Kheoni wildlife sanctuary in   district and saw the participation of 32 bird watchers and wildlife enthusiasts from Indore, Dewas, Ujjain and Bhopal. 
 
 The bird survey, organised along with Wildlife & Nature Conservancy and Bird Count India, began on Saturday morning and ended on Sunday afternoon after holding three sessions of bird watching. As many as 125 species of birds were spotted in the area of which four were new. 
 
 “The survey was organised as a part of forest department’s bid to develop Kheoni wildlife sanctuary on lines of Kanha and Bandhavgarh tiger reserves, as some tigers have also been spotted at the sanctuary by the forest department team,” Ujjain CCF BS Annigeri said. 
 
 The department’s objective of the survey was also to track the increase or decrease in the numbers of species at the sanctuary, as similar survey will be carried out in winters to take record of migratory birds. Surprisingly during the survey, some species of winter migratory birds were also seen at the sanctuary, despite rise in temperature in the region. These species were Siberian yellow wagtail, black redstart and red throated flycatcher.
 
 “The forest department organises vultures counting annually since it is an endangered species but for the first time an overall bird survey has been organised in   region. White capped Bunting, Brown fish owl, Indian Eagle owl and Stork billed kingfisher are among the few birds which are rare in this region but are not endangered or vulnerable,” Ajay Gadikar, bird watcher and coordinator of bird count India said. 
 
 Kheoni Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1955 and is spread over an area of 123 sq. kms. It is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna and is mostly covered with dry deciduous forest with teak and bamboo cover.
