CHANDIGARH: Heavy downpour on Saturday covered Zirakpur’s potholes but exposed the commuters to danger. The flooding slowed traffic at the Baltana traffic lights.

 The potholed roads of Baltana create a chaos every time it rains.   resident Shalabh Jaiswal said: “The condition of the roads hasn’t improved even after several complaints to the authorities concerned. The potholes under the stranded murky water are hard to spot.”
 
 On the rain-preparedness of the municipal corporation, commuter   said: “The rainwater takes minutes to gather and hours to drain. These potholes have been troubling us for long time. The mud that flows on to the roads also makes the surface slippery.”
 
 Baltana’s drainage channel is just 10-foot wide, which slows down the flow and ripples it back towards localities, which floods the streets. Resident   said: “The town authorities need to build a road that stays on for at least a few years, at least longer than the first spell of rain.” The potholes become a death trap at night, since their depth is difficult to fathom, and mud presents another challenge.
 
 Daily commuter   said: “The traffic on the main as well as internal roads has increased over the years but the maintenance work has been delayed. The complaints go unnoticed, while commuters keep getting injured. Two-wheeler skid most easily on these surfaces.” Expressing their anger over the condition of roads, commuters said they were most wary of the loose pebbles scattered all over the roads. Many two-wheeler riders have taken a tumble on these rough roads.
