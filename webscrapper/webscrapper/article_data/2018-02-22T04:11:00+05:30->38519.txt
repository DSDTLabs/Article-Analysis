Vadodara: An unusual controversy has surfaced at MS University over a meeting that a couple of students of M S University’s Institute of Leadership and Governance (ILG) recently had with “azadi” speech fame Kanhaiya Kumar of Jawaharlal Nehru University.  On Wednesday, a group of student leaders affiliated to Vidyarthi Vikas Sangh (VVS) submitted a memorandum to MSU officials terming the meeting that ILG’s students meeting with Kanhaiya Kumar as an ‘anti-national activity’. Going a step further, the student outfit which has its roots in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) – the right wing student outfit – said that such an activity was in the process of making “Kanhaiya Kumar in Baroda”.  “This is shameful event for the university that students of ILG had organized a meet up with Kanhaiya Kumar who is known for anti-national propaganda of Jawaharlal Nehru University of New Delhi seeking the expert opinion and advise on the role of students in politics and political entities (sic),” read the memorandum submitted by VVS led by its general secretary Parth Radadiya.  ILG officials, however, said that the institute runs a one-year diploma course in political leadership and governance in which students meet various political leaders having diverse ideologies. “If students who are studying leadership meet a student leader, what is wrong in that? Meeting anybody does not amount to adopting or approving the ideology for which he or she stands for,” said Jigar Inamdar, advisor to ILG.  Inamdar said that the students who were on visit to Delhi had accidentally met the JNU student leader at the canteen where they had informal discussions. “The group of students also had met ABVP and NSUI student leaders of JNU,” he said, alleging that the issue is being raked up by a group which wants to make political gains ahead of the syndicate elections on February 27.
