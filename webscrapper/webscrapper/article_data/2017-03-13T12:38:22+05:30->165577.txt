LUCKNOW: The landslide victory of   has ensured that the number of women MLAs, too, has reached highest 40. In the 2012 elections, 36 women had won. It was a record at that time. 

 Among the winners, maximum 34 are from BJP, two each from BSP and   and one each from SP and Apna Dal (Sonelal).
 
  In 2012, 19 women candidates had won on SP ticket, six are from BJP, three each from BSP and Congress, one from Apna Dal and one independent. 
 
 But the representation is far less than the quota of 33%. "Patriarchy was all the more glaring during elections. Women laders are not preferred as candidates, therefore, their representation in the house is a meagre 8-10%," remarked Sanjay Rai, core committee member, Association for Democratic Reforms, UP. Experts said the problem is rooted in distribution of tickets which is visible in figures, the average being 8% across parties. Ruling SP and BJP were most generous while giving tickets. 
 
 Of the total candidates fielded by the party around 8% were women. Congress, the party that mooted the idea of 33% reservation gave only 4% of its tickets to women while BJP that is headed by a woman fielded only 3% women candidates. 
 
 In all, 445 women were in the fray of whom 40 won.
