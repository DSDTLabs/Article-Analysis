For years, Bengaluru has been listening to the promises of the BBMP. We have dreamed when the promises were made, waited for years for some of it to come true, and moved on when most of it doesn’t. So when   paints a picture of the future that is Bengaluru -- a city where the   issue of the   is solved by a   -- it is a thrilling one. Forget that the Metro itself is several years behind its deadline, and that the pod taxi network has not been implemented in the most developed of nations.

 BBMP commissioner Manjunath Prasad told Bangalore Mirror on Tuesday that the project is being planned for the city and once implemented would be completed within six-eight months.
 
 The project will cost Rs 50 crore per km, he said. Considering the depressing financial situation of the Palike, the Commissioner was quick to add, “The BBMP is not investing a single pie for the project.” The project will be implemented under the design, build, finance, operate and transfer system. Private contractors will be bidding for tenders that will be called for the project.
 
 A few upscale areas in the city have been identified for the project. They are: M G Road metro station to Leela Palace (4 km); The Leela Palace to Marathahalli (6km); Marathahalli junction to EPIP junction (6km), MG Road metros tation to Koramangala (7km), Jayanagar 4th block to J P Nagar 6th phase (5.3km) and Sony junction to Indiranagar metro station (6.7km).
 
 If the plan is not futuristic enough for you, take this: The project will comply with ASTM international F24 technical committee, will be build under solar-powered mobility with people and cargo, won’t have any emission, accidents, will be a round-the-clock transport system with safety measures such as video-monitoring round-the-clock.
 
 “The project will come up on the median of the road and there is no need to acquire any property for the project. It will work as a feeder service for mass transit like Metro and the fare will be cheaper than auto or bus fare.”
 
 It is just what the city needs. Good roads, better garbage disposal and maintaining the infrastructure the city has are so passe. Everybody in the city agrees with the commissioner when he says there is a need to decongest roads. “The city has changed drastically over the years and such projects are required to de-congest the roads.”
 JM Chandra Kishen, chairman, Centre for Infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning (CISTUP) is just a tad surprised with the plan though. “My take is that it might be a futuristic idea but it won’t solve the city’s urban transportation issue. The need of the hour is to integrate the existing public transportation
 system for seamless travel. Introducing new projects is not the solution and at the same time I am quite surprised that the work is being taken up by the BBMP.”
 
 The commissioner said a tender will be issued in a few days. Experts from IISc have studied the project and found it to be technically feasible, he said. Technically feasible it might be, but does the BBMP have qualified people making the plans? MN Sreehari, Urban Transport Expert said, “The BBMP might have engineers working in the organization but there are hardly any well qualified people who would even be able to understand the complexities involving this kind of technical bids. This is the season of proposing projects as elections are drawing near and this is also a result of that whim to satisfy their own fancies. A civic body that is devoid of technical knowledge to build a flyover in a proper manner is not equipped to execute a project that they have only seen in some science fiction movies.”
 
 Many are also left unsatisfied with previous attempts in the country to start the hi-tech system. Vinay Srinivas of Hasiru Usiru said,
 
 “The idea of taxi pod was introduced first during the UPA regime in 2009 at a jamboree organized by the government of India called the Urban Mobility India conference and expo. It was first planned to be built at Gurugram, but till date it’s hanging fire. The very idea of coming up with pod taxis is ridiculous when simple urban mobility solutions are available.”
 
 
 A pod? What’s that? 
 Personal rapid transit (PRT), also called podcars, is a public transport mode featuring small automated vehicles operating on a network of guideways
 
 Where in the world are they operating?
 In the world podcars are used in just a few places: West Virginia, US; Rivium, The Netherlands; Heathrow airport, UK; Suncheon in South Korea
 
 Will Bengaluru be first city in India to get it?
 No. In India, the plan was first okayed for Gurugram. Work on it began last year. At least six states, including Rajasthan and Maharashtra, are said to have initiated talks to get this transport system.
 
 
 * Instead of planning to making a sci-fi idea like pods, BBMP should aim at something more realistic like cleaning up the city every day or finishing the remaining flyovers and subways.

 * The concept will eat up a lot of employment. Auto and cab drivers will receive a blow to their income. The drivers will create chaos.

 * They have not finished the Metro till now. They are making us wait so long for the Metro and now they come up with something totally new. The government should finish one thing before going on to another.
 -Ashwin Gowda Student
 
 
 * It’s hilarious that BBMP has dreams of making a pod transportation in Bengaluru. They’ve fallen so far behind their timeline on making the metro, by the time they finish making the pod, it’d be atleast 10-12 years.

 * This is a good initiave from the government’s side. I can get rid of the hassle of traveling through the traffic of Bengaluru and finally reach my location on time!

 * If this happens, then we really should be proud of it! The whole world has a notion that we are a ‘not-so-developed! And to look at it, this will make traveling so much easier and better.
