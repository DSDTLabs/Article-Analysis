GURUGRAM: The district administration will transfer 65 acres of land to   for shifting the Kherki Daula   plaza to Sehrawan in a day or two. The new toll plaza will be located at a distance of nearly 11km from the existing one.

 The administration took the plot at Sehrawan from the Manesar gram panchayat. Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, “We can give NHAI possession of the land after one day notice. After taking possession, NHAI can apply for forest clearance and other NOCs.” He added, “There are two aspects of shifting this toll plaza , one is providing alternative land and the other is reaching a financial agreement with the concessionaire, i.e. fixing the new toll rate and costs of managing the toll plaza.” 
 
 The expressway concessionaire, Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), is however not satisfied with the site.   officials said that if the toll plaza is shifted to Sehrawan, their income will take a hit. S Raghuraman, CEO, MCEPL, said, “Firstly, NHAI has not received the land yet. Secondly, if the toll plaza shifts from Kherki-Daula to Sehrawan, it will be a huge loss to us. Nearly 80,000 vehicles cross the Kherki-Daula toll plaza daily. Moreover, MCEPL has the right to collect toll till 42km (Kherki-Daula) into the Delhi-Jaipur expressway and not beyond that. Only 40,000 vehicles cross Sehrawan which is 53km into the expressway. We are already running at a loss after the Gurgaon-Delhi toll plaza was removed.” He added, “NHAI will have to ask a contractor to build the new toll plaza. We have not received anything in writing from NHAI yet. MCEPL has written to NHAI on the losses it will incur due to the shift. We also plan to put it in front of our bankers and see what legal action can be taken.”
