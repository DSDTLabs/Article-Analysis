PUDUCHERRY: The Congress-led   government has decided to file a contempt plea before the   against the Centre for failing to honour the order to constitute   management board and Cauvery water monitoring committee, despite lt governor   saying the move 'is not appropriate and is not legally permissible.' 

 After an all-party meeting on Monday, chief minister V Narayanasamy told reporters the government whip R K R Anantharaman will file the contempt petition. 
 
 Earlier, in a letter to Union home minister Rajnath Singh, Bedi said she advised the Puducherry government not to file the contempt petition as it is not appropriate and not legally permissible under provisions of Section 55 (b) of the Government of Union Territories' Act, 1963.
 
 She said Puducherry being a Union territory 'is not an independent legal person'. "All suits and proceedings for and against the administration should be instituted only in the name of Union of India. Filing of a contempt petition by Union of India represented by the Puducherry government against the officers of the Union of India will not be appropriate," she said. She added that as an interim measure she directed the Puducherry government to file an interlocutory petition.
 
 Bedi also urged Prime Minister  , in a letter, to direct the ministry concerned to constitute the Cauvery management board and Cauvery water regulation committee at the earliest. She marked copies of her letter to Singh, Union water resources minister Nitin Jairam Gadkari and Narayanasamy. "Due to an abysmally low quantum of water released, the area under cultivation has drastically reduced affecting the livelihood of farmers in Karaikal," she said.
