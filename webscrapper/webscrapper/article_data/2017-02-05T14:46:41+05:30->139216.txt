NOIDA: A week after he accused at least 10 BJP leaders including Noida candidate   of ‘pressuring him’ to withdraw his candidature, BJP’s rebel candidate Captain   is all set to support Pankaj.

 According to sources, BJP president Amit Shah is likely to make the formal announcement of Gupta officially supporting Pankaj Singh on Sunday during his visit to Noida. Thereafter, Gupta is likely to withdraw from the polls. 
 
 Gupta was one of the five ticket hopefuls from the BJP and had even bought a nomination form on behalf of the party. Speaking to TOI, Gupta said he had been associated with the saffron party for the past 10 years and pledged all support. “I have never left BJP, and BJP has never left me. I have put in more than ten years of service to the party and will continue to do so,” he said.
 
 On being quizzed about the withdrawal of his candidature, Gupta said he met BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Thursday, who in turn arranged Gupta’s meeting with Amit Shah. “Amit Shah persuaded me to back Pankaj Singh,” Gupta said. However, he did not confirm his withdrawal from the upcoming polls.
 
 Gupta is popular among ex-servicemen and claims support from the Vaishya community too. If he continues to fight the election, his supporters claim that he is likely to make chinks in the vote bank of Pankaj Singh, despite Noida being considered a ‘safe-seat’ for the latter.
