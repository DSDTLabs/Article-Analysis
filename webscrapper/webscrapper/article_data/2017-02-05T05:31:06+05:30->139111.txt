 Police charged them under IPC section of gang rape and under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act).
 
 The eunuch, Nisha, and his friend, Tarachand, visited the girl’s house regularly and play with the girl until her mother recently asked him to stay away from her daughter. 
 
 On Friday night, the girl apparently stepped out of the house to relieve herself without taking her mother along and lost her way back.

When neighbours heard the girl’s screams and broke into Nisha’s house, they found her lying naked and unconscious and informed her parents.
 
 Police said the colony members soon located Nisha and Tarachand, who were lurking in the area, and handed them over to the police. The two accused admitted to sexually assaulting the girl at their home and were produced before a magistrate who remanded them in judicial custody for 14 days, police said.
 
 The girl was sent for a medical examination and counselled by an NGO. Family members said she had learning difficulties since childhood and required assistance in most of her activities.
