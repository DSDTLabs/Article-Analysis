MUMBAI: A few days before   was assaulted by train bullies on a Western Railway local, another commuter had been thrashed by a group of eight at Mira Road station. While the   (GRP) went into overdrive to nab Shukla’s attackers in record time, the other case has been relegated to files at the police station.

 On February 18, Sanjay Jadhav who deals in readymade garments had boarded the general compartment of a local train at Virar around 2 pm. He was going for a wedding with his family members who were in another compartment. Jadhav was standing near the door when three young men boarded the compartment at  . “They were performing stunts, bending in and out of the compartment. I asked them to step backwards a bit. One of them threatened to throw me out of the train. He also yelled an expletive, at which I asked him to mind his tongue,” said Jadhav.
 
 
  
 
 The men made a few calls and asked those people to come to Mira Road station. “They said on phone that they would teach me a lesson. I was anxious and took off my watch and spectacles. After we got off, there was a group of five men waiting at the station. They joined the three men who had had an argument with me and together, they rained blows and punches on me. I started bleeding from the nose. Soon, my shirt was bloodstained,” said Jadhav.
 
 As co-passengers raised an alarm, the attackers fled. Jadhav and his brother-in-law, who had reached by then, went to the beat chowky. The cops took Jadhav to a public hospital. “Copassengers had clicked pictures of some accused which were handed over to the cops but no breakthrough has been made yet,” said Jadhav. An officer confirmed that an FIR was lodged.
