Madurai: In a dramatic climatic swing, the southern districts on Tuesday received a fairly wet weather coupled with gushing winds in Madurai and Theni, forcing weather watchers to raise a cyclone signal flag at Pamban port.

 As summer seems to have almost set in the state with unbearable heat, the intermittent rain has come as a huge relief to many who struggled to cope the rising temperatures that at times touched 36 degree Celsius in mid-February. 
 
 The climate dropped down to a 30 degree Celsius in the evening and more rain was expected in the latter part of the day. The afternoon temperatures dipped to a comforting 33 degree Celsius and it remained cloudy throughout the day on Tuesday, with drizzles adding to the cool climate in Madurai.
 
 Theni saw a fairly decent rainfall including on the Western Ghats hills where the fire broke out. Sources said that if it continues to rain, it could help snuff out potential wildfire. The city experienced drizzles while the outskirts received fairly good downpour. Chittampatti in Madurai has recorded 3.6 mm of rain over the last 24 hours, followed by Melur with 2 mm, Thaniamangalam, 1.5 mm and Kallanthiri, 1 mm.
 
 Many southern districts recorded minimal rainfall after having experienced a fairly long wet weather for the last three months.
