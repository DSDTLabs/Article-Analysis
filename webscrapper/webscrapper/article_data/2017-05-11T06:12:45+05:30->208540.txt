SILIGURI: A   mowed down an   at   in Darjeeling’s   early on Wednesday.

 The 18-year-old tusker was crossing the Siliguri-Katihar route railway line near Deomani river when a Bihar-bound train mowed it down at 4.30am. The train dragged the jumbo along a certain distance before part of the engine tossed its body off the track. 
 
 The tea garden where the accident took place is frequented by jumbos from Bagdogra and Bengdubi forests, who mostly come to the locality at night and return early in the morning. 
 
 Jumbos have often been killed on the tracks in north Bengal. Since 2004, trains have ran over over 60 jumbos on the New Jalpaiguri-Alipurduar broad-gauge lines that pass through national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
 
 “The jumbo was headed to Bengdubi forest when it was run over. The tusker was most probably mowed down by a goods train,” said T T Bhutia, a Bagdogra forest ranger.
 
 The railways and forest department have put in place many regulatory measures to avoid such incidents in north Bengal, especially along the NJP-Alipurduar route. They include placing speed limits while crossing the forest areas and designated elephant corridors. The number of night trains has also been brought down while visibility along the tracks has been increased according to the Supreme Court’s directives.
