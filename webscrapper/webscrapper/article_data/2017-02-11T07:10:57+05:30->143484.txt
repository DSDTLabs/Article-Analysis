KOLKATA: Two senior police officers including the Kolkata Police commissioner were hauled up by the   on Friday in different cases. While Justice   expressed displeasure after going through an affidavit submitted by city police commissioner Rajiv Kumar in reply to a contempt rule, West Midnapore   came under fire from a bench headed by acting Chief Justice Nishita Mhatre for inaction against a panchayat functionary who lopped off trees without permission. 

 The high court had initiated a contempt rule against Kumar after he failed to respond to an application by the   for a meeting in Kolkata on January 14. Justice Bagchi had directed Kumar, after he appeared before the court on January 27, to file an affidavit to explain his behaviour. On Friday, the CP did this through advocate general Kishore Dutta. After going through the part where Kumar had stated he was at Gangasagar on the day the application was filed by the RSS, Justice Bagchi observed he isn't satisfied. 
 
 "The commissioner of police, Kolkata, travels to Gangasagar but there is no supporting document. The affidavit is incomplete. File a fresh affidavit within four weeks, clearly stating why the court's directives weren't abided by. If police make their own rules despite a Rule of Law, then it is difficult to maintain law and order. Police should uphold majesty of the court," Justice Bagchi said. 
 
 Ghosh was also present in the court of acting Chief Justice Mhatre and Justice   in a case pertaining to illegal felling by the Bolpai gram panchayat pradhan in the Sabang police station area.
