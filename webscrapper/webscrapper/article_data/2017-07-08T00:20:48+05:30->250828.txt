MUMBAI: Leader of the opposition in the legislative council   on Friday demanded the immediate dismissal of Mumbai   Sanjay Deshmukh for maladministration.

 “Results of several crucial exams are yet to be declared. A sum of Rs 111 crore has been withdrawn from the fixed deposits for paying salaries to the employees. It reflects a complete collapse of administration at all levels. I urge the governor to dismiss him,’’ Munde said.
 
 Alarmed by rampant irregularities, particularly in the examination system, Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao had convened a special meeting to take stock of the state of affairs in the Mumbai University. He set July 31 as the deadline to declare the results of all exams. Munde urged chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to probe all the decisions taken by the former chief executive officer of the Slum Redevelopment Authority (SRA), Vishwas Patil. “A week before his retirement, Patil cleared 450 files. Many files were brought to the SRA office on the day of his retirement on June 30. All decisions taken by Patil and proposals cleared by him should be stayed and a high-level probe should be conducted,’’ Munde said.
 
 Following a tip-off, acting SRA CEO Milind Mhaiskar, who is also managing director and vice-chairman of Mhada took possession of all the files. Vishwas Patil said that he cleared less than 120 files a week before his retirement and that he was prepared to face probe by any agency. Fadnavis has taken the view that most of the files were routine, however, he has asked the new CEO to scrutinize all the files cleared by Vishwas Patil.
 
 Munde has demanded a probe by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate into the transactions of Gangakhed Sugars, a factory controlled by Ratnakar Gutte. “Loans were obtained by Gangakhed Sugars without the knowledge of farmers. They have received notices for repayment. The total debt stands at Rs 650 crore,” Munde said.
