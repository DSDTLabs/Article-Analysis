After years of speculation,   recently revealed the status of his much anticipated project  , scripted by MT Vasudevan Nair, announcing that it is soon going on floors. 

 While filmmaker Hariharan's name was widely heard as the director of the movie, it was later revealed that ad filmmaker-turned director Sreekumar Menon, who has worked with top actors from across languages, will helm the project.
 Sreekumar says about the project, 'We will go on floors in 2018 with the project and the team who has been researching on the project for two years is about to wrap up the work. We have just started the pre-production work. It will be a project of international stature and once everything is in place, we will be giving the film a befitting launch.' The movie which is based on MT Vasudevan Nair's book Randamoozham, is a re-interpretation of Mahabharata from the perspective of Bheema.
 
 Mohanlal plays the role of Bheema in the film and many Bollywood and Kollywood actors are also rumoured to be part of the movie, to play the other major roles. The film is coming in two parts and its humongous cost ranging around `600 crores has already become a talking point in the industry. 
 Mohanlal has essayed the role of Bheema in the past too. He enacted the role of Bheema in the play Chayamukhi in 2008 alongside actor Mukesh, who acted as Keechakan.
