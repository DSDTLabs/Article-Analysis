 More than 11 lakh students had registered for the CBSE Board Class 12 examination, which was marred with controversy over the paper leak issue. The exams were held at 4,138 centres in India and 71 centres outside the country.
 
 "CBSE Class 12 results for Academic Session 2017-18 to be declared on 26th of May," Education Secretary Anil Swarup said in a tweet.
 
 The Board had conducted a re-test of Class 12 Economics paper on April 25, nearly a month after it was leaked triggering widespread outrage and confusion among students across the country.
 
 The CBSE had also postponed the examinations scheduled to be held on April 2 in Punjab at the request of the state government in view of 'Bharat Bandh' called by several Dalit organisations against the alleged "dilution" of the SCs/STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
 
 The examinations were held in March and April.
