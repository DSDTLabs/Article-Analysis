PATNA: Patna district magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi will hold a meeting with the heads of private city   affiliated to the   (CBSE) and   for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) on Sunday.

 At least 200 private schools, different associations and district programme officers are likely to attend the meet. The schools will be reviewed on several safety parameters like installation of CCTV cameras and monitoring system, maintenance of school website, delivery of important information to guardians through SMS, first aid facilities, disaster management preparedness, parking space, number of vehicles owned by schools, GPS system in buses, contact numbers on vehicles and number of seats in LKG.
 
 It will also be seen whether the schools are following the norms of Right to education (RTE) which mandates a minimum of 25% free seats for children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in private schools. According to a source, of the 389 schools in Patna, only 122 schools are following the RTE norms.
 
 “Schools have been asked to fill a form which consists of several questions regarding safety measures and RTE norms. They have to submit the forms by March 16 and ensure that they do not flout any rule,” the DM told this reporter on Thursday and added strict action would be taken against the violators.
 
 The district administration had organized similar meetings in September last year after the gruesome murder of 7-year-old Pradyuman Thakur at   in Gurugram.
