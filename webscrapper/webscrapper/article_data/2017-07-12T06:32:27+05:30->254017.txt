LUDHIANA: While 140   were challaned during a special drive of additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic)   at Bharat Nagar Chowk on Tuesday, the officer himself drove over the rules.

 ADCP Brar and his team held a   drive against the   violators for almost three hours. Those jumping red light and driving without documents were taken to task. However, during these three hours, the private car in which the ADCP came remained parked at the zebra crossing. Neither the officer nor any other cop noticed the violation.
 
 Brar said, “Zebra crossing is for pedestrians and not much traffic passes through that point, so I parked my car there.”
 
 The challan drive caused traffic chaos with cops stopping vehicles in the middle. When a woman cop stopped a woman driver for jumping red light, she walked up to Brar and started arguing with him. She even asked for a proof to show that she had jumped the light. The woman allegedly misbehaved with the cop and refused to leave the spot. After one and a half hour, her relative came, apologized on her behalf and paid the challan amount. 
 
 Meanwhile, another woman also claimed that she had not jumped the light and started arguing with the cop. When ADCP Brar asked to call cops from division number 5 and book the woman for misbehaviour, she immediately left the spot after paying the challan amount. 
 
 
 
 
 During the drive, traffic cops stopped the nephew of DGP Suresh Arora at Bharat Nagar Chowk. But, as soon as he told them about his relation with the DGP, the officials let him go.
 
 A few minutes later, son of Jammu & Kashmir IG Sunil Sharma was stopped for checking at the same spot. Even as the youngster, who was driving a car that had stars on number plate and a covered beacon, told them about himself, cops took him to Division Number 8 police station. He was allowed to go half-an-hour later, after they verified his credentials from the J&K police.
