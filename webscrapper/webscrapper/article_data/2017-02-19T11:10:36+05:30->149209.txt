 ( ): The first event in the newly constructed building of Abhinav Vidyalaya in Saifai is going to be an educational one but not one for schoolchildren. 

 On Sunday, the Yadav family and other voters will reach the school to cast their vote. 
 
 The building, however, has not been inaugurated for conducting classes as yet. 
 
 According to locals, till the 2014 parliamentary elections, a government primary school existed on the same land and was used for polling booths. In 2015, the primary school building was razed to pave way for Abhinav Vidyalaya. Classes were shifted to the adjoining building of Amitabh Bachchan Rajkiya Inter College. Since then, schoolchildren have been attending classes on the same campus. 
 
 Classes are expected to begin in the new building once the new academic session begins.
 
 Election staff, police and paramilitary forces have completed their preparations to ensure timely beginning of polling in the four rooms of this school building on Sunday.
