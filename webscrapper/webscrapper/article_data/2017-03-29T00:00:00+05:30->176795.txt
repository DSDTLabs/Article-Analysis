The trailer of director Puri Jagannadh’s upcoming Kannada-Telugu bilingual,  , gave audiences a clear indication that it is the tale of a young man, played by debutant  , who hates girls and then romances ‘Anjali’. The film is a two-heroine project, with   Kriszlinzki and   Chopra in the lead, which begets the question — which one of them is Anjali? As it turns out, both girls are called Anjali in the film. “Yes, we are both Anjalis, and romantically involved with Ishan’s character. The when and how will be revealed in the film,” says Mannara.
But considering that Rogue is Ishan’s big-ticket debut, and the heroines share a name, what drew Angela and Mannara to it? “Puri sir,” they say in unison. “He is known to present his leading ladies differently and with this film he has two uniquely scripted characters for me and Mannara,” says Angela.
