NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday reiterated its demand for apology from   president   on the   issue after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s admission of “not doing enough” to prevent misuse of users’ data during his testimony before the United States Congress on Monday.

 Soon after the testimony, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad targeted Gandhi, whose party has been accused by BJP of using the stolen data for elections.
 
 “Now that Cambridge Analytica’s role in manipulating elections is clear and Facebook has assured to stop it and maintain integrity of India’s elections, probity demands that Rahul Gandhi should apologise and promise not to manipulate voters and divide the society in future!” Prasad tweeted.
 
 However, Congress IT cell chief Divya Spandana reacted through tweet: “I reiterate, the Congress party has never engaged with Cambridge Analytica, nationally or regionally.”
