GURUGRAM: While air pollution levels were low for a change in   during the past week, levels of   again increased on Thursday, making Gurgaon the second most polluted city in the country.

 The highest   of PM2.5 was 89.90 micrograms per cubic metre at 7.30pm. The city’s air quality index (AQI), however, remained at 170, which is considered ‘moderate’ and it can cause breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases.
 
  According to the national safe standard, the level of PM2.5 shouldn’t be more than 60 micrograms per cubic metre.
 
 Even though the level of PM2.5 is not very high, experts say that it is unusual in this season. “There are only a few cities in the country that report a high level of PM2.5 during this season. These cities are generally located close to industrial areas. However, it is not so in Gurgaon. The Millennium City has very few highly polluting industries. Faridabad, which is an industrial hub, on the other hand, reported AQI at 67, which is considered ‘satisfactory’. The authorities really need to examine why the air pollution levels are rising in the city despite favourable weather conditions,” said Debjani Ghosh, an environment engineer.
 
 Officials of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), on the other hand, refuted the claims saying various factors were responsible for a rise in the PM2.5 level.
 
  “First of all, the air quality is ‘moderate’ in the city. Also, we can’t blame the rising level of air pollution or one pollutant on one particular factor. Proximity of the city with Delhi and traffic congestion sometimes increase the level of PM2.5 during peak hours in the evening,” said an HSPCB official, requesting anonymity.
