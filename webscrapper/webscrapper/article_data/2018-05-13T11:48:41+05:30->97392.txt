Under the subsidy breakup, Rs 1.5 lakh is being paid by the central government while Rs 1 lakh by the state government. The remaining amount (Rs 1.75 lakh) is to be paid by the beneficiary.
  
  The housing scheme at Ramganga Nagar is a project spread on around 269 hectares of land and the foundation stone was laid in 2004. The development process is running at a slow pace due to some pending land disputes with farmers, officials said.
