BENAGLURU: A   from Bengaluru representing   (AHPI) on Tuesday backed the   (NMC) Bill and said it must be passed. The legislation has drawn flak from a section of doctors as also prominent sections of the civil society.

 “ While India has 63,000 MBBS seats, there are only 14,500 post graduate medical seats. The draft National Medical Council (NMC) Bill proposes to increase the number of PG medical seats, which is the need of the hour. Let all the oppositions and objections to the NMC bill be discussed at length, but let the bill move on,” said Dr Devi Shetty, founder and chairman of Narayana Health.
 
 The NMC Bill aims at creating a robust medical education regulatory system and overcoming the challenges faced by the health sector in India, doctors said. They said the bill has many positives, like considering post-graduate medicine degrees like Diplomate of National Board (DNB) on par with the MD and MS.
 
 However, doctors admitted that they had their share of concerns about the bill. “The proportion of elected representatives from medical fraternity in NMC is 20%, which is grossly inadequate. This has to be enhanced appropriately,” said Dr Devi Shetty.
 
 Do not promote crosspathy, say doctors
 
 The doctors, however, opposed the six-month course proposed allowing ayurvedic and homeopathic doctors to practise allopathy. “This move will affect patients across the country. This is nothing but short cut to MBBS. The intensity with which MBBS is studied is different. The parliamentary committee hadn’t approved this, but it has become a part of the NMC,” said Dr  , president, AHPI. Dr Devi Shetty said the exit exam proposed by NMC must not be made mandatory.
