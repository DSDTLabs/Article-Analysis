HYDERABAD: An upset chief minister   made it clear on Thursday that the Telangana government had strongly pushed for an extension for IAS officer   as chief secretary.
The Centre overlooked his candidature on technical grounds. Sources said KCR was upset with the remarks made by Chandra at the farewell party hosted for him on Wednesday.
 
 “Unfortunately, I was run out for no fault of mine.There was a feeling among the public that sincere and committed officers are not rewarded and it was more so if the officer concerned is an SC,“ asection of the media quoted Chandra as saying at the event.
 
 On Thursday, the chief minister told his close aides that he had sincerely tried to get Chandra an extension as chief secretary and even sent five MPs to meet Prime Minister   to pursue the matter.
 
 “I had personally made the request to the PM when I met him recently and also sent an official letter to the PMO. If I did not want his tenure to be extended, why would I have appointed him as CS in the first place in December last year,“ KCR said.However, Chandra's extension was not entertained by the Centre as it raised serious objections over his absence from service for 11 long years in which 8 years were lea ve without prior permission, the CM said.According to him, the   and Training too raised objection at the absence of   of the officer for eight years.
 
 The PMO red-flagged Chandra's after-study stay in the USA. “He was given three-year study leave but he did not return immediately after his study. From 2003 to 2011, there were no ACRs for him. What can a chief minister do if the PMO raises objections and refuses to consider our plea?“ KCR told his aides.
