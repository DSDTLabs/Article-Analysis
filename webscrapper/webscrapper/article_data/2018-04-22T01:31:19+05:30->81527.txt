NEW DELHI: A senior merchant   officer working with a Hong Kong-based company was arrested for allegedly   and harassing several students of a women’s college in south Delhi. Cops recovered the three mobile phones he used specifically to send vulgar messages to the girls.

 DCP (southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said that the accused has been identified as Suraj Dey (29). Police officers said that Dey was tracked and nabbed after several girls approached them stating that they were receiving lewd and threatening messages from a man who had met them some time ago.
 
 A student from the college had lodged a complaint on April 17. She told cops that some time ago, a man who introduced himself as Suraj met her in Amar Colony market.
 
 “He said that he was looking for a PG accommodation for his girlfriend in the area,” the girl had told cops, adding that she agreed and they exchanged numbers.
 
 Afterwards, Dey started messaging and calling the girl seeking information about PGs but later on started flirting with her. When she didn’t respond to his advances, he started sending her lewd messages and pictures. Later on, Dey reportedly threatened the girl as well when she stopped responding to his messages.
 
 After the girl’s complaints, cops started investigating the incident and went to the college. They asked the students if they had faced similar instances following which four more girls came forward and narrated their ordeals to the cops. It was discovered that the accused was using multiple phone numbers and would call and threaten the students if they blocked his numbers.
