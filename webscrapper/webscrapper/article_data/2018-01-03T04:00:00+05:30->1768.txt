Ahmedabad: A number of medical practitioners and doctors based in Ahmedabad along with medical students in city-based medical colleges joined the nationwide stir called by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to protest against the controversial National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill on Tuesday. However, the strike was called off later in the day after the bill was referred to a parliamentary standing committee for review, which has been asked to give its report before the budget session. NMC Bill which was tabled in the parliament on Friday, seeks to replace the Medical Council of India (MCI) and also proposes to allow practitioners of alternative medicines such as homeopathy and Ayurveda to practice allopathy by simply completing a ‘bridge course.’ The move led to a storm among medical practitioners as they claim it is not in the interest of public health. Several clinics remained closed on Tuesday either for half a day or at times even the entire day. Dr Yogendra Modi, past president, IMA – Gujarat state branch, said, “We are not in favour of the bill as it is completely against the public interest. It is practically not feasible to allow alternative medicine students to do a small bridge course and then practice allopathy. However, as soon as we learnt that the bill has been sent to the parliamentary standing committee for further review, we called off the stir.” Various other doctors also kept their clinics shut on Tuesday. “Such a bill is completely impractical. It is indeed a regressive step by the government. Instead of this, the government should focus on providing good care and services,” said Dr Nita Thakre, a city-based gynaecologist. Various medical students also protested against the bill. “The two systems of medicine are completely different with an entirely different approach and it is simply impossible,” said Laxman Bhammar, a medical intern with BJ Medical College.
