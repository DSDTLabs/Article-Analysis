HYDERABAD: A city-based district consumer forum has directed the   at   to pay a compensation of Rs10.83 lakh to a patient who was rendered permanently disabled due to the inability of the hospital's doctor to correctly diagnose the vascular compromise caused by a road accident. Apart from the compensation, the patient was also awarded Rs10,000 towards costs.

 G   told the forum that he met with an accident on October 17, 2011, while travelling on his two-wheeler and was taken to the   Hospital as he was a beneficiary of the ESI health scheme.
 
 He said he was examined by Dr  , the head of the orthopaedic department at the ESI Hospital and an X-ray was conducted on the left knee and leg, which revealed a fracture of the Tibial Plateau.
 
 He further said that after the doctor left the hospital at 2.30 pm, he had severe pain and was administered painkillers by the paramedical staff based on directions from Dr Satyanarayana.
 
  At about 9.45 pm, he was referred by the duty doctor to a private hospital empanelled with ESI, on Satyanarayana's advice. The doctors at the private hospital observed severe swelling of the left leg, cold limb, absent toe movements, sensation over the left ankle and foot absent, distal pulsations absent and he was admitted with a fracture of the left tibia (Candyle) with vascular compromise. Eventually, with no improvement in vascular supply and limb condition, a below-the-knee amputation was performed.
 
 Sudhakar alleged that he was left with no other alternative but to go for an amputation due to the callous and negligent attitude of Dr Satyanarayana.
 
  He also filed a case against the doctors of the private hospital alleging negligence while performing the amputation. The bench further added: â€œThe amputation could have been avoided had immediate medical attention been given to the condition of vascular compromise. The complainant was rendered permanently disabled due to the act of negligence of Dr Satyanarayana."
