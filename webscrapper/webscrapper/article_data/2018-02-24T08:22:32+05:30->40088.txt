NEW DELHI: Massive economic power shift to Asia, ageing of population, speed of technological changes and the search for a new societal deal are expected to be crucial factors in the future, Dominic Barton, global managing partner of consulting firm   and company, said.

 “The first is this massive economic power shift towards Asia, certainly India is right in the middle of that but many people in the world underestimate the speed at which that change is going on,” Barton said at the  .
 
 He said there are going to be 2.4 billion (240 crore) middle-class consumers coming into the world in the next 15 years and a large number will be coming from India. “Most of us in the West are under-appreciating the speed and scale of that,” he said as he dwelt on the forces that will shape the world.
 
 He said the second force is technology. “Technology is moving at a speed we have never seen. Companies need to think of themselves as   companies.”
 
 The third is the ageing population around the world and Barton highlighted the need for skilling and newer jobs. “There is no way we can retire at 65.”
 
 The fourth force is inclusion. “A few people are gaining from these changes but a lot of people are not and people who are not gaining and not being able to participate are upset,” he said, while talking about a new societal deal. He said automation is coming faster than being thought and many jobs will be eliminated in most countries and highlighted the need for re-skilling and training. “If we don’t skill and re-skill, people we will have a problem.”
 
 Barton identified innovations carried out of India could be an example for the world. “If there is any country that can show us how to do this, it is India. So, I do believe, I can see $10 trillion (Indian economy) on the horizon. Whether it’s 2030 or 2040, the momentum is there.”
