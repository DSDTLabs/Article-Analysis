MUMBAI: Guards at the Taj, directed by Danish Husain for Aditya Birla Group's Aadyam initiative in association with The Times of India, opened at the   on April 29. Starring   and  , the dark comedy begins on the eve of the Taj Mahal's unveiling in 1648.

 “Right from the time we learnt about the Taj Mahal, we've heard ghastly myths about the hands of those who built the monument. This play turns that legend into a   of friendship. Ever since I read the script, I knew this was one play we needed to stage in India. Although it's set 350 years ago, the dialogues resonate the absurdities of our times, and relevant to matters of censorship, whimsical laws, rigid governance around the world,“ says Hirjee.
 
 Vrajesh drew director Danish Husain's attention to the script, who was quick to suggest that Vrajesh and actor Joy Fernandes be a part of this twohander. “With Danish and Vrajesh, there were already lunatics on board, and being offered apart in the play meant they were looking for more lunatics!“ laughs Fernandes. “ As a two hander, the emotional range the characters go through is incredible and you realise how eerily the play is relevant to the world today . All this is done with a huge amount of comedy , dark comedy... a space I revel in.“
 
 Guards at the Taj marks a first for Aadyam in attempting a smaller production. The black box at G5A is uniquely immersive, breaking the proverbial fourth wall where the audience is as much a part of the play , as the actors. Vrajesh attests that working on the play has taken him beyond the confines of his comfort zone.“Comedy comes naturally to me but Danish and Joy pushed me to a realm of understanding that audiences can respond in different ways.“
 
 Catch the play at G5A Foundation from May 3 to 7.
