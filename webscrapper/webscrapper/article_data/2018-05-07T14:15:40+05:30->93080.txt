In the latest episode of  , Adithya calls Surya to drive him out of the house, as a part of his challenge to Sam. Mimicking an anonymous voice, Adithya informs him that Vajrapati Surya has got into a brawl with someone at the market place. He also requests him to rescue Surya before the situation gets murkier.

 Surya, who feels that it’s as an opportunity to nab his look alike, immediately rushes to the location mentioned by Adithya.
 
 Meanwhile, Adithya who has come home to try out his next trick is startled to catch a sight of a rather happy family. Samantha gives him a quick recap of the earlier events - the family agreeing to Padma’s exit and the subsequent bonding of the Vajrapati sisters- Rajyam and Jayantha.
 
 In a desperate move to create clashes in the family, Adithya yells at his elder sister Padma for not leaving the house yet. However, the entire family is aware of the fact that Surya is not in the right state of mind. So, they pretend to dance to his tunes.
 
 As Adithya is suspicious about their unexpected behavior, an outsider suddenly demands Surya’s attention. He demands Surya an explanation for misbehaving with his sister (an employee in Surya’s office). Adithya doesn’t leave this opportunity to defame Surya.
 
 He further abuses the outsider and his family. Surya’s family tries to explain his mental disorder to the person and beg an apology. But miffed by Surya’s words and deeds, the outsider catches the collar of Adithya (in Surya’s disguise). In a reflex, Padma slaps the person for misbehaving with his brother much, which surprises Adithya.
