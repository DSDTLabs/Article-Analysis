HYDERABAD: Special NIA judge   resigned on Monday just hours after pronouncing the judgment in the   blast case, a surprise decision which set off speculation about the possible trigger. 
 
  
 
 Sources in legal circles said Reddy, additional metropolitan sessions judge in Hyderabad, had cited personal reasons in his resignation letter. The judge, who was on the verge of superannuation, immediately proceeded on 15 days’ leave. 
 
 A section of lawyers swiftly took to social media to claim that a corruption complaint against Reddy was pending in the high court which has come down hard on allegations of graft in the lower judiciary. However, this was rebutted by high court sources. “We have not received any complaint against this judge,” a source said. 
 
  
  
 
 The high court has lately pursued a zero tolerance approach towards alleged corruption among a section of the lower judiciary in   and Telangana. Discreet and preliminary inquiries are immediately ordered into corruption charges. If found prima facie true, the allegations are straightaway referred to the anti-corruption bureau for registration of criminal cases and further investigation. Sometimes, the   seeks a nod from the HC authorities.
 
 Ravinder Reddy was the President of Telangana judges association that spearheaded a revolt and had even resorted to a rally on Hyderabad roads demanding immediate bifurcation of subordinate judiciary. 
 
  
  
 Their association was opposing the retention of AP-origin judges in Telangana courts. There are also rumours that there will be many more cases in the offing. It was in this background, judge Ravinder Reddy’s resignation too was sought to be linked with the corruption angle. 
 
 But judicial sources in the HC themselves have rejected this in his case. There were also rumours that he has plans to join politics and that he may sail with one of the newly formed political outfits. But there is no confirmation on this yet.
