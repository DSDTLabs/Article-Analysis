CHENNAI: To   and   and no vending zones in the city, the   will begin   this week. 

 A consultant is being finalised for the survey and the exercise is expected to take a month. Following this, representatives of hawkers will be selected to form town vending committees (TVCs) in each of the 15 zones of Chennai. 
 
 "We also have a database of resident welfare associations who we will contact for civil society representation," said a senior corporation official. Local police and civic officials have been chosen in all zones to represent urban local bodies. "Chennai is the only city which will have a separate TVC for each zone as opposed to other cities which have one central TVC," said the official, adding "Our city has a higher number of hawkers." 
 
 Last August, the civic body sent a proposal to the government seeking to form smaller TVCs and a government order allowing this was issued.
 
 The TVC in each zone will issue ID cards and licenses to vendors and decide on hawking spaces on streets and beaches where they can hawk. This was notified by the state government to all cities and districts to carry out this exercise under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014.
 
  Top civic officials could not regulate or evict mushrooming of hawkers in beaches and on pavements until the TVC was formed to settle disputes.
