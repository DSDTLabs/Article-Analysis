GUWAHATI: Tripura Police on Friday evening 'pushed back' Assam minister of state for power   back to his state from Gandacherra in Dhalai distict for violating election rule that bars a person from another state from staying in an election-bound state after the end of campaigning. 

 SP (Dhalai) SR Das said, "He was found at Gandacherra in the   constituency area even after campaigning came to an end at 4 pm. As per   guidelines, a person from a different state can't stay after the end of campaigning period. So, we escorted him back beyond the assembly constituency. He should now go back to Assam."
