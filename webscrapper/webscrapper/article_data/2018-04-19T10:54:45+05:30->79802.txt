CHENNAI: Greater Chennai   on Wednesday signed a general partnership   with the city of Brussels to promote the exchange of technical know-hows between the cities, in issues concerning urban development.

 On behalf of the city corporation, S P Velumani, minister for municipal administration and water supply, signed the agreement at the state secretariat. The state secretary for development co-operation of the Brussels Capital Region, Bianca Debaets, signed on behalf of the Kingdom of Belgium, a statement from the civic body said. The term of the agreement is for five years, with a clause for renewal on mutual consent.
 
 Corporation officials told TOI this was not a sister-city agreement like the one inked in July 2016 with the South Korean city of Ulsan. “It is a   agreement to exchange knowledge on various issues of governance and best practices adopted by Brussels to tackle them. Belgium has a policy of entering into such agreements with national capitals. It is the first time they have chosen a city other than a national capital,” a senior corporation official said.
 
 Representatives of Brussels Capital Region mentioned the city’s resilience in the face of disasters like flooding as one of their reasons to pick Chennai. Corporation officials added that the knowledge exchange would come in handy as the city pushes ahead with smart city project. “In terms of financial backing from Brussels, it will be decided after the specifics of a project are finalised, be it smart city or revamp of solid waste management. As it stands, the agreement is purely on generic terms,” the official said.
