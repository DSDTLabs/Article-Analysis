MANGALURU: A herd of wild elephants from a nearby reserve forest have sneaked into villages of   taluk, triggering panic among locals in the area.

 A herd of eight elephants have made their way to the bank of the Payaswini river near Basmadaka in Sullia taluk, about 90 kilometres from here. According to locals, the elephants have appeared after a gap of two years. They say the elephants may have come from the Medinadka reserve forest.
 
 Meanwhile, forest officials are making desperate attempts to chase the elephants back into the jungle. Officials say that elephants entered human habitat three days ago. The herd consist of five calves. Officials point out that the herd destroyed plantations in Tudiyadka and Mandekolu villages.
 
 After a complaint was lodged by villagers, a team of forest officials camped in the area to prevent the elephants from entering residential areas.
 
 Range forest officer Manjunath N asked locals not to panic, as the   is taking all necessary steps to chase them back into the wild. He said on Sunday evening they managed to chase the herd back into the forest, but a male  , aged about a year, was   due to dehydration.
 
 He told TOI that veterinarians were called in to treat the calf, which has now recovered completely, and is ready to join the rest of the herd. “We are keeping a watch on the calf and pinning hopes that the herd, which includes the calf’s mother, come back and take it along with them. If the herd doesn’t return and leaves the calf behind, we will think of taking some other action,” he added.
