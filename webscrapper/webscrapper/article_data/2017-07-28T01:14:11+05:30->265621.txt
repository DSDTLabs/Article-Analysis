NEW DELHI: The Delhi   has questioned   why has it not yet updated its website that on court orders re-evaluation was permissible in all Class XII subjects.

 HC’s poser came after it was told by some students that the board was reluctant to accept applications for re-evaluation despite its July 6 order.
 
 On its part, the board maintained that in any case the deadline for accepting such applications from students was till July 7, as fixed by an earlier court order, and so it stopped entertaining requests after that.
 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar, however, did not accept CBSE’s argument. “You gave the students only a day’s time (on July 7) to apply for re-evaluation without even informing them about our decision (of July 6)?”   demanded, pointing out that following court’s intervention the deadline couldn’t be valid.
 
 The court then indicated to the students whose pleas were not entertained to file applications so that it could pass orders. 
 
 On July 6 HC had made it clear that “the relief (of re-evaluation) is not confined only to the petitioners before it and shall be admissible to all the similarly situated students who seek re-evaluation”. HC was hearing a plea by four students challenging CBSE’s June 28 notice making re-evaluation of subjects conditional. Earlier it had set aside the conditions following which the petitioner students applied and saw their new scores increase substantially.
 
 HC would now take stock of the case next month, even as some of the students are expected to approach it with individual applications.
