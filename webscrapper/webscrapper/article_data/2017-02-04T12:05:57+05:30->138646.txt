THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In an indication that the tussle between senior IAS officers and   Jacob Thomas is far from over, chief secretary   has recommended a police investigation against Thomas over the purchase of a dredger when he was serving as director of ports. He has also noted that Thomas should be asked to step down from his present post till the inquiry is completed in the interest of fairness. 

  Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has referred the recommendation to the director general of prosecutions for his views. Senior CPM leader V S Achuthanandan, meanwhile, is learnt to have written to Vijayan in support of Thomas. Sources said Achuthanandan expressed concern over the continuing fight among IAS/IPS officers and said IAS officers, including the chief secretary, were now trying to tarnish the image of Thomas. 
 
 The chief secretary made the recommendation on the basis of a probe report by additional chief secretary KM Abraham who found that Thomas had caused a loss of Rs 14.96 crore to the exchequer in the purchase. The investigation has been recommended on charges of forgery, cheating, unduly favouring a foreign company, misrepresenting facts and abusing the tender process.
