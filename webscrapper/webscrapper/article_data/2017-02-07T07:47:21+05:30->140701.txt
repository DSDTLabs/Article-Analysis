PUDUCHERRY: Hundreds of students of the government-run   (Pec) boycotted classes on Monday and staged an   to protest against the government for collecting exorbitant   and alleged large-scale financial irregularity in running the hostels.

 The hostel inmates said the government `doubled' the annual hostel fees to Rs 68,000 this year and added that most of the students who joined the government college on merit hail from poor backgrounds and are not in a position to pay the fees.
 
 The students demanded that the government reduce the hostel fees by Rs 30,000 per annum with immediate effect and order a vigilance probe to unearth “large-scale financial irregularities“. They also wanted the government to produce accounts on the expenses incurred in running the hostels to the representatives of the hostel inmates and ensure periodical submission of accounts. The students, who said that other fees including the tuition fees ( Rs 13,000 per year) were nominal, said the government has been periodically hiking hostel fees in order to pay salaries of staff members of the college.
