THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Twelve-year-old   was on cloud nine as she smiled through her  . The braided long hair and bright red gown added to her charm and gaiety as she spoke in length about the first prize she won in the aksharashlokam competition held at the revenue district school arts festival. 

 Winning and losing are part and parcel of school art festivals but it was special for Harda, who has been swimming against the tide to acquire the skills in clarity of speech and pronunciation in aksharashlokam despite her bilateral cleft lips.
 
 However, there are more reasons which make the prize special for Harda and her parents. According to them, Harda was denied selection to the state level competition last year due to biased judgement by one of the judges. “We had given an appeal to the AEO as they rejected her at the district-level completion. The judge claimed that she lacked clarity and precision in pronunciation. But after we filed an RTI, it was found that she had the highest score and yet was denied selection. One year later, she won the first prize which came as a reward for her hard work,’’ said Harda’s mother Leena A P.
 
 At the revenue district arts festival, there were seven participants and seven rounds of recitation of aksharashlokam. “It was an extremely easy affair for me because I have been practising aksharashlokam twice daily for the past one year. Of all the seven shlokas recited at the arts fest, my favourite is vannethi jhansi naadin ribhu pada phadalikullil….,’’ said Harda
 
 One long year of practice and hard work had led Harda to taste the fruits of her success as she is getting ready for the seventh surgery which is scheduled for this March. Harda had been undergoing several surgeries since 2013. She is a class VII student at the   at Paluvally.
