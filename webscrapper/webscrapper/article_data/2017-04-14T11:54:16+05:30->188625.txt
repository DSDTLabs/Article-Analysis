NAGPUR: Even though the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire and emergency services department is reeling under  , the   continues to misuse the firefighters. The civic body doesn’t even mind deputing the trained firemen on duties other than attending emergency calls. Since 2011-12, city firefighters have cleaned 17,662 wells in the city limits, reveals data compiled by the fire department.

 According to rules, NMC should not misuse firemen and the work of cleaning wells should be assigned only for emergency calls. According to statistics of the department, it has actually attended to 5,168 fire calls and saved property worth over Rs958 crore. Besides this, it has also attended 3,523 emergency calls including rescue operations in flood prone areas, not only in corporation limits but also in neighbouring districts.
 
 In the last fiscal, it cleaned 2,944 wells, mostly private ones, even though the state government’s audit department had raised an objection over misuse of firemen and had asked NMC to stop it. The department has actually dedicated eight firefighters and two submersible pumps just to attend and clean wells. “Lack of manpower also affected the department’s earnings from various sources, like issuing no objection certificates to saw mills in Lakadganj,” the audit report has stated.
 
 Firemen blamed elected public representatives for the misuse of their services and pointed out that the leaders exert pressure on senior officials to deploy firemen to clean wells. Corporators from both ruling and opposition parties are equally responsible for this mismanagement, they alleged.
 
 Ideally, the job of cleaning wells should be done by the water works department, said a source in the fire department. He added that the civic administration had taken the fire department for granted.
 
 The firemen are also made to deliver official mail, like agendas for general body and standing committee meetings, and at times, even personal mail, invitation cards etc. This is despite the fact that the NMC is having an exclusive public relation department. Besides, they are also asked to wash statues erected at prominent junctions before programmes, among other jobs handed over by the NMC administration.
