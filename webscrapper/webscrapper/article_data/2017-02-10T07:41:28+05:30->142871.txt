ROHTAK: All-India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) general secretary Ashok Balhara on Thursday said they were waiting for an invite from the Haryana government’s committee to hold dialogues with Jat protesters sitting on dharna across the state. 

 “Our intention and mood are clear. There is no hidden agenda except reservation demand in jobs and educational institutions. The government panel should come with an open mind whenever it comes to meet us to resolve the issue,” said Balhara, who hails from Girawad village near Meham of Rohtak district.
 
 Addressing the gathering from a stage set along the national highway-71A, Balhara exhorted people to assemble in large numbers on February 19 to commemorate ‘Balidan Diwas’ in the memory of those killed in the violence during the Jat agitation in February last year. 
 
 Rahul Dangi of Meham was the first youth who was shot dead outside Inspector General office-cum-residence on February 19 when violence broke out, he said while addressing the gathering. 
 
 Meanwhile, Inder Singh Hooda, brother of former chief minister  , on Thursday reached the dharna site at Jassia village and donated Rs 1.50 lakh for raising the issue across the state till the demands of Jats were accepted. Congress MLA and former deputy speaker   also reached the dharna of AIJASS in Jhajjar and announced his support for the community that has been protesting for the last 12 days.
 
 Meham Congress MLA   Dangi told newspersons that the BJP would have pay the cost of not giving reservation to the community in the ongoing Uttar Pradesh elections. He predicted defeat of the saffron party on many seats in western UP.
