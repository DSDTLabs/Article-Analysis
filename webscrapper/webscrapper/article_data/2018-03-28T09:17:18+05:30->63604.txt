Reports of veteran   Jayanthi passing away late Tuesday night, after a long battle with chronic asthma, have been refuted by her family. She was reportedly rushed to a private Bengaluru hospital on Sunday, after complaining breathing difficulties, where she was being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

 Jayanthiâ€™s son Krishna Kumar had earlier gone on record with a Kannada news channel saying that the star had been suffering from chronic asthma for a long time. She was advised immediate hospitalisation when her breathing issues arose.
 
 Rumours of her passing began doing the rounds on Tuesday afternoon, but they were rubbished when reports stated that the actress was being shifted out of the ICU. Jayanthi's family also reportedly claimed that although her condition was critical, she was in fact "recovering."
 
 Jayanthi had acted in over 500 movies across Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil and Marathi languages.
