HYDERABAD: The Congress will take along with it all the “anti-KCR forces” and likeminded parties and organisation to take on the incumbent Telangana Rashtra Samithi in the 2018-19 polls in Telangana.

 “As was the case in Gujarat, the Congress in Telangana will also unite all anti-KCR forces. TPCC president   is already working on it,” AICC secretary in charge of Telangana affairs, R C Khuntia said. He also dropped indications of the   likely to have a tie-up with the new political party to be launched by TJAC. Khuntia described TJAC chairman   as a great person and said that the Congress party had great respect for him. “Kodanadaram played a crucial role in the Telangana statehood agitation. He is not an agent of the Congress party as being claimed by ruling TRS,” he said.
 
 Khuntia further said, the Congress will soon take out “padayatras” in every assembly constituency, district and state level. Congress president Rahul Gandhi will address a public meeting in Hyderabad coinciding with the Telangana State Formation Day on June 2.
 
 Khuntia said no one within the party has raised objections to the talk of BJP’s Nagam Janardhan Reddy joining Congress. “Any new joining would be done after consulting local leaders,” he said. He also demanded that the CM should send a delegation to Kuwait to bring home the people from the state in distress there. A delegation of Congress leaders would soon visit -Kuwait, he added.
 
 Earlier, the BC Saadhaikarika Committee meeting decided to tour the State and study the problems of BCs and critically evaluate the BC schemes being offered by the government. It will submit a report to the TPCC in three months.
 
 In a separate development, TPCC chief Uttam demanded CID probe into the alleged misappropriation of funds in the Telangana SC, ST Study Circle.
