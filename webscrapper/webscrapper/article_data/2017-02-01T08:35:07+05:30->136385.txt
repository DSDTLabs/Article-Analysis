 Residents endup parking their vehicles away from their homes, forcing patients and school children to pass through dug up roads. "I have been residing here for the last 60 years. We have no other way out. The entire road has been completely blocked. We are unable to take our vehicles inside the camp. Our children and elders walk on the dug up road with a lot of difficulty. Even patients are suffering a lot," Shaik Ghouseuddin a resident of the Muhajireen camp said . 
 
 In this regard, camp dwellers claimed to have requested   authorities to allow their vehicles to enter from the rear side of Mecca Masjid, but authorities refused to give them permission. Locals told TOI that there are certain patients who need daily medical care. Sometimes they have to visit hospital, but no vehicle can't enter the camp due to the road blockage at Laad Bazaar. "Last night my niece's health suddenly deteriorated and she was rushed to hospital on my shoulder. As there was no place for any vehicle to come inside, I requested Mecca Masjid authorities to open the gate to let me go out. But I was not allowed. I had to use the existing dug up road from Laad Bazaar," Ghouseuddin added. Dwellers want   officials to expedite the work .
