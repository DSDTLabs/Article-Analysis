CHENNAI: Actor  , due to make his political debut in four days, met former chief election commissioner T N Seshan, a man known for bringing in reforms that sought to end electoral malpractices. Kamal met the 86-year-old Ramon   Award winner on Friday for 15 minutes. 

 In a surprising turn of events, he also met  , president of the right-wing Hindu Makkal Katchi . Kamal, who has been vocal in his opposition to the Hindu right-wing, hosted Arjun and other functionaries of the saffron outfit at his office in Alwarpet. In July last year, the Hindu Makkal Katchi had sought the arrest of Kamal for "tarnishing Tamil culture" through the TV reality show Bigg Boss. The outfit went on to file a police complaint demanding a ban on the show and the arrest of Kamal Haasan and some of the show participants.
 
 Emerging from Seshan's residence at R A Puram, Kamal told reporters, "I visited Seshan to check on his health. He told me he would have joined my party had his health been in better condition." Kamal, who is set to launch his political party on Wednesday, has been involved in meetings with legal experts and election officials over the registration of his party. 
 
 Following the SC verdict on the   water dispute on Friday, Kamal also met   coordination committee president P R Pandian. In June last year, Pandian had slammed fellow farmer P Ayakkannu for meeting actor Rajinikanth to seek funds for the proposed national river inter-linking project. Pandian accused that Ayyakannu was trying to downplay the Cauvery issue. 
 
 Meanwhile, the Rajini Makkal Mandram newly-appointed secretary Raju Mahalingam and chief coordinator are screening candidates for various local-level posts of the outfit. To keep his fans motivated during the drive, Rajini released a video on Friday, addressing his fans from Niligiri.
