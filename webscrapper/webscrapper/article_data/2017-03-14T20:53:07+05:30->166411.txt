LUDHIANA: After results of assembly elections, it's celebration time for the winning candidates of Ludhiana. But on the other hand, majority of the candidates who have lost the elections have suddenly gone into hibernation. Some of them have taken to social media to thank public and their supporters in spite of not being able to make it through. 

 Although the posts by the losing candidates are drawing a lot of likes and reactions from city residents, some of the posts are going viral due to the interesting response and are being shared a lot.
 
 A message of thanks posted on Facebook by Shiromani Akali Dal’s ex MLA Ranjit Singh Dhillon, who lost the contest from Ludhiana East constituency, has gone viral and has been liked by thousands of people due to the response to Dhillon’s post given by his daughter Jasleen Dhillon, who has hinted that some traitors are responsible for Dhillon’s defeat.
 
 “You're actually a winner dad and you are and will be our MLA, your opponents don't even match u even if they tried they can't even be like your shadow, we are proud of you and will always be, you deserve better and thanks to our traitors who were something else on our face but were something else from inside, god sees everything and he will return everything with interest. You are the real winner”
 
 Similarly Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Harjot Singh Bains, who lost from Sahnewal, posted a poem on his facebook page which drew very interesting comments like “Oye tu haar gaya” (You have lost). After Bains posted a reply “i did not come into politics only to win” a person commented “Je jittan lai nai aaya si fer kagaj kyu bhare” (If you did not wanted to win why did you file nomination) Another person has also commented on Bains’s poem who said, “Manjil te thali ch pros ke ayi si, thonu chamchagiri ton vehl na mili” (Your destination was served to you in a platter but you did not get free from sycophants)
 
 Congress candidate Bhupinder Sidhu who lost elections from Ludhiana South city posted a video of him thanking the public of the constituency and promised that he will still stand by them and so should they. To this post he got a reply “Veer ji congress di hwa bnoni ya south hlke ch , ta aj toh e km shuru krdo , ghr ghr nu hoju shuru” (Brother congress’s wave has begun in South constituency, you should start working right away and go door to door)
