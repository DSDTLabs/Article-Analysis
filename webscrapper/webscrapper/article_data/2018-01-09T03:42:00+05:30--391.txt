Panaji: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB), on Monday, directed Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) to suspend its coal handling activity at the mooring dolphin facility with immediate effect as it has no consent to operate as mandated under the Water Act and Air Act.  At the board meeting chaired by GSPCB chairman Ganesh Budhu Shetgaonkar, it was decided to engage the services of IIT-Mumbai to ascertain likelihood of impact of dusty cargo at the mooring dolphins by way of air pollution modelling. The directions to MPT also comes in light of the fact that it has not adopted any pollution control measures at the offshore facility. In December 2017, MPT had itself submitted that it has no pollution control measures at the site. The green board had directed port authorities to submit details of pollution control measures taken and details of impact assessment at mooring dolphins so that it can take a final decision on whether to permit coal handling at the site. The board issued directions to MPT under Section 31 (A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and under Section 33 (A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. On July 21, 2017, the board has issued a showcause notice to MPT as to why under the relevant provisions of the Water Act and Air Act it should not be directed to suspend all coal and dusty cargo handling activities in the port area till it obtained consent to operate at the mooring dolphins from the board. On November 11, the board received an application for grant of consent to operate from the MPT with respect to eight mooring dolphins.  After inspecting the mooring dolphins on November 17, board officials said no specific environmental precautions had been undertaken and directed MPT to give a satisfactory reply with respect to pollution control measures taken at the offshore site.
