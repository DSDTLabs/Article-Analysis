COIMBATORE: It would seem that the   imposed by the state government after the   tragedy has come as a dampener for adventure clubs and their activities. But adventure clubs here say there is a sharp increase in requests to organise trekking or other adventures activities this year.

 “Despite the Kurangani incident, many college students and IT professionals have approached us to organise treks. In the past two months, there were some 500 requests, which is at least 10% higher than last year,” said managing director of   M Dhinesh Kumar.
 
 With the ban in place, the clubs have started to focus on adventure activities like water sports, long drives through forest in jeeps, safari and camping in tree houses. “There has been about 10-20% increase in number of people enrolling for such activities,” said Ramesh Kutty of Coimbatore Trekking Club.
 
 With the ban in Tamil Nadu and strict trekking norms in Kerala, many avid trekkers have started to go to Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, said AS Thileep, another organiser. “Adventure activities, mainly trekking, are addictive and once you start enjoying them, you would never want to stop,” said M  , a software engineer, who treks twice every month. But organisers said requests from families to organise adventure activities had come down. “The requests are mostly from individuals below 30 years,” said an organiser.
