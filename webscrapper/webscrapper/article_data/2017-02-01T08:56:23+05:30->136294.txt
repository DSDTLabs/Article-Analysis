KALYAN: Facing flack for accepting an invite and joining celebrations at the wedding of a wanted chain-snatcher in   on Sunday , where the who's who of chain-snatching in India was present, the police have, two days later, nabbed him. In their own defence, they said on Tuesday that their participation was a cover for the arrest that followed. It remains to be seen if the police are indeed telling the truth and if more arrests follow. After all, over a 1,000 people attended the wedding, a rare, publicly declared congregation of criminals.

 The groom,   (25), alias Irani, has over 25 cases of chain-snatching against him and was wanted in an   filed last year. His father, Tejib Shah, the leader of the local Irani community , invited cops from the local   and  , and also senior police officers. The marriage itself was illegal, as the bride, Toufiq's aunt's daughter  , is only 15 and thus a minor, but that is another matter.
 
 Senior Inspector Ravindra Doifode, who heads Thane police's anti-chain snatching squad, said on Tuesday that he asked his team to attend the wedding to get details about chain snatchers, but not disrupt festivities “as it could have led to a law-and-order situation“.He said around 25 cops from the squad were present at the function. One of them told TOI, “We had to dance with the guests as we didn't want them to suspect that we were keeping a watch.“
 
 Toufiq was arrested in 2012 under MCOCA (the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act). The arrest led to the recovery of a large number of stolen gold chains.After bail, he reverted to crime, attracting another MCOCA charge in 2016, but he went absconding.
