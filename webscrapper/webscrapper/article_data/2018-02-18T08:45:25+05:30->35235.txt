PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Shops in   village downed their shutters on Saturday to protest against the merger of the village in the   limits. 

 The villagers demanded that the village be granted the status of a nagar panchayat. 
 
 A week ago, the   general body had approved the merger of nine villages into its municipal limits — Gahunje, Jambhe, Marunji, Hinjewadi, Maan, Nere and Sanagawade, Dehugaon and Vitthalnagar. The resolution will be sent to the state government for final approval. 
 
 “A gram sabha was held on Tuesday wherein many villagers opposed the merger. We later decided to observe a bandh today in support of this demand,” said sarpanch Usha  . 
 
 “Dehu village is famous due to  . Its identity will be lost once it becomes a part of Pimpri Chinchwad,” Chavan said, explaining the reason for the opposition. 
 
 “The gram panchayat has provided the village with good roads, water supply and drainage facilities, so we don’t need PCMC,” she said, “We have sent letters to the chief minister, collector and others conveying our opposition and demanding nagar panchayat status.”
