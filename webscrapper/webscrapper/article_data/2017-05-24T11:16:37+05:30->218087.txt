NAGPUR: Seventy different organizations, under the banner of   (MSGOA) with 1.25 lakh officers and 16 lakh state government employees, have threatened to go on a mass strike in the state from July 12 to 14 if their demands are not met by then.

 These include employees from all the government sectors like health, revenue, education, animal husbandry, sales tax, income tax etc, but excludes the police department. 
 
 “We have been negotiating for our demands regularly. Yet we are giving more than a month to the chief minister to assess our demands and take action accordingly. If the government considers the demands favourably, we will surely not go on strike. We are against the strike, and this is our last weapon,” said GD Kulthe, president of MSGOA .
 
 The major demands of the MSGOA include implementation of the seventh pay commission, increasing the retirement age from 58-60 years, implementing the maternity leave as per central government rules from three months to two years, filling all the vacant posts (about 1.8 lakh), implementing biometric attendance system, implementing advance increment scheme.
 
 The other members of the organization include vice president Dr Pramod Rakshamwar, secretary  , treasurer   and Madhav Zoad, Dr Sanjay Manekar and Dr Shantilal Lunge, public relations officers and the women’s wing president Sanghmitra Doke.
