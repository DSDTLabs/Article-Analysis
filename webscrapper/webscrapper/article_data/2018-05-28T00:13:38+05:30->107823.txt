Tirupur: The Udumalpet Government Hospital is all set to get an additional 100 beds and a special newborn care unit (SNCU). Minister for co-operation Udumalai K Radhakrishan laid foundation stone for the work on Saturday. The hospital, which currently has 196 beds, caters to the needs of the local population estimated to be around three lakh. Since the patronage has increased over the years, the government decided to provide 100 more beds at a cost of Rs 5 lakh. Comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (Cemonc) facility has been provided in Tirupur District Headquarters Hospital and government hospitals in Udumalpet and Dharapuram. SNCUs, which can provide advance treatment to babies born with medical complications, are already functional in Tirupur and Dharapuram hospitals. SNCU in Udumalpet hospital will be a 20-bed facility and will ensure that more doctors and nurses are deployed along with advance equipment to provide better medical care to the little ones, a health department official said.
