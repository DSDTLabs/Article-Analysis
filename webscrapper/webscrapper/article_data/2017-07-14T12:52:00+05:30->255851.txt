Singer   said she would be elated if musician and 'Voice Kids' co-judge   performs at her wedding ceremony. 

  
  
 The 26-year-old songstress, who is in a relationship with model  , said she hopes the McFly lead vocalist-guitarist honours the promise that he has been making in various interviews.
 
 "I'm hoping he does it, he has said it a couple of times. I was hoping he wasn't just saying that in interviews and won't actually deliver. Make sure you print it. I would love him as the wedding entertainment," Lott said. 
 
 The 'Kiss The Stars' singer said it will be a refreshing change to listen to Jones on her D-day as lately it seems she has always been the one singing at other people's weddings. Lott is due to marry Cheshire next year.
