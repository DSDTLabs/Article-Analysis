NEW DELHI: Five of eight complainants of sexual   at   have said they took time to come forward as the hierarchical structure of   departments makes it very difficult for students to go against their laboratory supervisors. This is the major reason for sexual harassment in the science field, read a statement by 165 scientists who came out in solidarity with the complainants on Monday. 

 The students had come forward with their experiences on March 22, a day after professor Atul Johri was given bail. 
 
 Calling for the blacklisting of scientists involved in sexual misconduct, these scientists from across the country issued a statement expressing concern. They said there is a need to “address issues of sexism, prejudice and harassment” in laboratories. “While not every science laboratory is an unsafe space for women, to think of this (the JNU incident) as an isolated case of an individual wrongdoing would be an oversimplification and an understatement,” the statement read.
 
 It added, “Scientific research in India, particularly its higher echelons, remains predominantly the preserve of men. What adds to this power and authority is the need for mobilising large amounts of funding required for experimental research which the   or laboratory head provides. The absence of women in decision-making bodies, their lack of adequate representation in committees and academies all come together to create an environment in which women and their concerns all appear marginal to the serious business of the scientific enterprise.”
 
 Miranda House teacher Abha Dev Habib said a recent list of alleged sexual harassers in academia had names of people from all fields except science. “Not because there is no sexual harassment in the field but because it is very tough for students who work in the laboratory to go against their supervisors for their PhDs are in their hands,” Habib said.
