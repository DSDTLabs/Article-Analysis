DHANBAD: Dhanbad police have detained more than ten people, including   legislator  , his younger brother and his associates, in connection with the murder of former deputy mayor and   leader   on March 23.

 Addressing the media on Tuesday evening, Ajay Kumar Singh, additional director general of police (ADGP) (CID), said, “Police is close to cracking the case. Sanjeev’s younger brother will also be interrogated.”
 
 However, Sanjeev has denied his and his family’s involvement in the case.
 
 Officials, Ajay said, have also probed Sanjay Singh, whose brother Ranjay Singh, a close associate of the Jharia legislator, was shot dead on January 29. Ajay added that raids are being conducted in   and Bihar to nab the culprits. Police believe the four suspects in the murder case are residents of Uttar Pradesh and were temporary tenants here in Kusum Vihar.
 
 Meanwhile, former Jharia legislator and the deceased’s uncle Bachha Singh has demanded a CBI inquiry into the murder case. Speaking to media persons, Bachha termed the incident as a political murder and said the CID inquiry is nothing but an eyewash. 
 
 “Neeraj was growing as a leader in the coal belt, which was a source of worry for other leaders in the district. Sanjeev has eliminated his strongest rival with the help of a ruling party,” Bachha added.
 
 Four bike-borne criminals opened fire on the vehicle of Neeraj Singh, near the residence of Sanjeev Singh, when he was returning to his residence on March 23. More than 70 bullets were fired on the vehicle through the front wind screen which led to the death of all four occupants, including Neeraj, in the car.
