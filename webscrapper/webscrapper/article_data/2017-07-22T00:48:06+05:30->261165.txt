MUMBAI: The Bombay   has rejected an anticipatory bail   filed by   from Satara   in a case of alleged extortion and attempt to murder filed against him by a company owner, Rajivkumar Jain, in October. Jain said his company had closed down for maintenance and had reopened in January. 

 Public prosecutor Ajay Patil said that though Jain was paying wages of his labourers when the company was closed, he received a demand for Rs 2 lakh per month from the personal assistant of Bhosale, which he paid for 12 months. He was unable to pay for two months as the company was closed and had agreed to meet Bhosale as well superintendent of police, collector and labour commissioner at the   circuit house to sort out the labour issue, but was surprised to see only Bhosale, who he said issued threats to his life and slapped him.
 
 Bhosale’s counsel Ashok Mundergi said it was a “totally baseless case”. He said Bhosale had been “falsely implicated and by mere slapping persons a case of attempt to murder is not attracted. There is nothing to link Bhosale with the alleged extortion”. 
 
 Justice P D Naik, after perusing the record and hearing both sides, rejected the pre-arrest bail plea. In April, the sessions court had rejected the plea too. tnn
