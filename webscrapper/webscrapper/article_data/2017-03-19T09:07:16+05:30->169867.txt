RANCHI: The city skyline, cluttered with haphazard  , will go for an aesthetic change next month once the   pulls down the old iron frames supporting the displays. The civic body has decided to replace the old frames with smarter mono poles. 

 Municipal commissioner Prashant Kumar said the companies registered with the   will be allotted new places to install the   hoardings. “The work will begin from April,” said the commissioner.
 
 There are over 600 hoardings in the city and out of this figure, 170 have already been removed. The remaining will also be removed shortly. The civic body has also come up with rules and regulations for installing hoardings and they will be implemented soon, said sources at RMC. 
 
 The decision of the RMC to have mono poles comes close on the heels of the   directive asking for the removal of old hoardings. 
 
 Deputy mayor Sanjiv Vijayavargiya said, “The apex court had directed that hoardings which cause obstruction during driving have to be removed. We are going to pull down all hoardings which are installed haphazardly or have sharp angles and are very close to roads. All hoardings on highways will also be removed.”
 
 This apart, there are around 300 hoardings across the city, whose registrations have not been renewed as the companies have not applied for renewal. A drive was started by the RMC on Saturday to identify all such hoardings. 
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Bidyanand Sharma Pankaj said hoardings would be declared illegal if their registration renewal applications had not been submitted and they would be removed from the city.
 
 “Action will also be taken against those who put up hoardings illegally,” said the additional municipal commissioner. 
 
 The survey team will also be checking the hoardings whose registrations have been renewed to ensure the size of the displays has not been altered against the rules.
