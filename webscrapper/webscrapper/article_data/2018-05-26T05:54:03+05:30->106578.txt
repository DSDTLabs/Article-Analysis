MUMBAI: The   ( ) will announce results for Class XII students on Saturday afternoon. Over 11.8 lakh candidates across the country appeared for the examinations.

 While the board has not specified the time for the announcement, the results are expected to be declared around 12.30pm. This year, the board held a re-examination for economics on April 25 after the question paper was leaked a day before the scheduled date. While the re-exam decision received flak from many, principals feel the results are not likely to be affected by it. “The paper was easy so it may not be an issue for most students. Having butterflies in the stomach is normal. Even after so many years, as a school, we get excited as well as nervous. Students must accept the result in the best spirit and look forward,” said  , principal, RN Podar School, Santacruz.
 
 The board will also start post-result counselling for students and parents in distress after the results or with queries. The free tele-counselling service for parents and students will have on board 69 expert volunteers, including principals, trained counsellors, and special educators from CBSE-affiliated schools, and psychologists. The board’s Centralized Access System can be reached at toll-free number 1800 11 8004 for telephonic counselling from 8am to 10pm on all days.
