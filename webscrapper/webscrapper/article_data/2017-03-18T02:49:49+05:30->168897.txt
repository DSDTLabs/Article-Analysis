NEW DELHI: The Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) on Friday released a report on ‘ambient   of Delhi’ for  , which depicted alarming levels of PM 2.5 in the capital between November and February.

 Not a single day in the four-month-long   season was noted under the “good” air quality category, while a whopping 89% of the total days fell into either the “poor” or “very poor” categories of the graded response action plan (GRAP) notified by the Supreme court. The report also noted that 6% of the total winter days fell into the “severe” category, with PM 2.5 levels between 250-300 micrograms/cubic metre.
 
 According to the report, 981 micrograms/cubic metre was the maximum 24-hour average concentration of PM 2.5 observed, which was recorded at the monitoring station of Delhi Technological University (DTU) near Bawana Industrial Area on November 5. This is 16 times higher than the prescribed limits of 60 micrograms/cubic metre for the 24-hour rolling average of PM 2.5.
 
 “The air quality of the city was unbreathable and is choking its residents, especially those more vulnerable to it. It is a crisis looming at our faces and we cannot turn a blind eye to it. GRAP is the way forward and will help in improving the situation,” said Dimpy Suneja, programme officer, CEED.
 
 The findings have been based on data collected from 10 real-time air monitoring stations in Delhi, set up by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). 
 
 The findings were recorded between November 2016 and February 2017 from stations including ITO, Anand Vihar, Mandir Marg and Punjabi Bagh.
 
 The report also revealed that the monthly mean values showed a downward trend from November onwards.
