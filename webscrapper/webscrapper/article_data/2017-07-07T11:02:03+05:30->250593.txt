 has been wreaking havoc on the sets of father David Dhawan’s 'Judwaa 2' in Film City for the last seven days. "But I’m getting my ass whooped by 60 fighters," he exclaims, speaking to Mirror from the film set. He’s been shooting as both Prem and Raja, the twin leads, for the climax.

  
  
 For his turns in the sequel to the 1997 original that had featured   as the leads with Karisma Kapoor and   as his leading ladies, the 30-year-old actor trained for the part with extensive balance work, which required him to stand on a moving rubber tube like device and balancing his weight while he did rigorous weight training.
 
 "Sometimes, you got to get dirty. There was blood and sweat and the twins," he laughs, adding that the shoot is far from over as the unit still has portions to film with Salman who will be joining the schedule today.
 
 In August, the unit, including leading ladies   and Tapsee Pannu, will head to Portugal for a 12-day schedule. They had previously shot in London in a 40-day schedule.
