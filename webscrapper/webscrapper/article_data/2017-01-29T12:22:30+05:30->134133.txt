 The population of Singapore is 55 lakh, the writer said. “Of that, 55% people are Chinese and 13% Malaysians. Indians form 9% of the total population, of which Tamils are 5%. However, all languages are given equal treatment,” he said.
 
 Saying that literary organisations have a key role in developing Tamil language, Andiappan said, “There are 70 such organisations functioning in Singapore. Of them, 40 are Tamil organisations. They are continuously contributing towards the development of Tamil by introducing various activities. Observing ‘language month’ is one such activity. Accordingly, the month of April is observed as the language month.”
 
 Seeing the importance of such activities, the Singapore government is also extending help. “Various organisations and the government give many awards to encourage writers. There, if you are looking for jobs in the government sector, you should be well-qualified and efficient,” Andiappan added.
 
 World Tamil Sangam director KM Sekar, Tamil development deputy director  , writers from Madurai, Mysore, Singapore and Malaysia participated in the event.
