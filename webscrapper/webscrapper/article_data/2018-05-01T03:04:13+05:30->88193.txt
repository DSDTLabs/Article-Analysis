NEW DELHI: The   recently sought to know the progress made by   in developing nearly 370 acres of land in   near the   (IFC).

 DDA has earmarked 25 of 397 hectares for relocation of chemical industries from the Walled City. During the hearing of a plea related to the chemical traders, HC noted that apart from the 25 acres meant for traders, DDA was also supposed to develop several other things on the remaining plot, but has not disclosed what has happened or would happen on it.
 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said taxpayers money has been used to acquire the land and therefore, some unauthorised colony should not be allowed to come up there.
 
 Referring to the modified plan, HC noted that remaining area was to be used by DDA to develop a district centre, wholesale and retail markets, warehousing, service market, automobile showroom/parking, city park or forest for recreational purpose, transportation (metro/bus depot/ ISBT/ railway freight terminal), CNG station, police station and petrol pump.
 
 HC directed DDA to reply before May 21 its stand regarding the development on the remaining area as well as the proposed guidelines if development has not taken place.
