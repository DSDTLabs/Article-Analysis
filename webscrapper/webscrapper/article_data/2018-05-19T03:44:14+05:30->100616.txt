New Delhi: The online registration   for Delhi University’s postgraduate  , which was set to open on Friday, kept students waiting till late in the evening, with the website saying it was “coming soon”. While officials had said that the portal will start running by 5pm, it remained offline till 9pm. It was only around 10pm that it went online. 

 In an hour, 2,601 registrations were made and of them, about 200 were completed. Meanwhile, the undergraduate admission portal recorded nearly 1 lakh registrations in three days.
 
 Reminiscent of last year’s delays, the   portal remained non-functional on the first day itself as applicants waited anxiously to start with the admission process. This year, applicants will have to sit for online entrance tests to PG courses across 18 cities, which need to be selected on the portal. 
 
 Last year too, the undergraduate portal was delayed and several tabs remained non-functional nearly a week after it went online. This year, the administration, embarrassed by last year’s delays, decided to iron out all issues before declaring the admission portal open, even getting students to try out the portal. The undergraduate portal continued to rake in registrations with over 99,000 registrations till Friday evening.
