KOLKATA: While it is yet to be known what exactly has come West Bengal’s way in the form of new railway projects, the   ( ) and wagon manufacturers in the state had a reason to cheer.

 As Union finance minister   read out the plans for railways in his Budget speech on Thursday, he mentioned that   plans to procure 12,000 wagons, 5,160 coaches and 573 electric locomotives in 2018-19.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 “The railways has decided to increase wagon targets and restart purchase of coaches from trade. For Titagarh, this is a very positive step as we, along with our subsidiaries, are the largest wagon and coach manufacturers in the private sector. The railways’ investment in utilization of capacity by investing in rolling stock will positively impact Titagarh,” said Umesh Chowdhary, vice chairman and managing director, Titagarh.
 
 The railways had earlier set a target for 7,120 wagons, 4,659 coaches and 352 electric locomotives for 2017-18. According to a senior CLW official, the premier locomotive manufacturing unit in West Bengal set a target of 325 for 2017-18.
 
 “In addition to this, we aided   (DLW) in Varanasi to build about 25 electric locomotives. With the demand rising for electric locomotives, the railways is looking to create more capacity for their production. That is why   also started manufacturing electric locomotives. This year, we are likely to set a target of nearly 450 locomotives. Though the target is steep, this will be a very positive step for a production unit from the public sector,” the official added.
 
 Indian Railways has embarked on a mission of total electrification by the year 2020. This would lead to energy cost saving to the tune of Rs 11,000 crore for the railways and also increase the demand for wagons and coaches.
