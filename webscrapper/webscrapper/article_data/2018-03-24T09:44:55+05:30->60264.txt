UDHAGAMANDALAM: The public   near Charing Cross that was left abandoned for more than two decades has finally got a complete makeover. But there is a twist. It wouldn’t be any longer a facility where you could relive yourself. Instead, it has been converted into an art gallery. It was inaugurated on Friday by   collector  . The gallery is christened ONETWO. 

 Designed like a cottage, the toilet facility at the entrance of Ooty town was literally an eyesore and the municipality had mooted the idea of demolishing the structure when some local residents and a few activists complained about its sad state of affairs.
 
 
  
 
 And in a show of complete official apathy towards the 40-year-old structure, the municipality also set up a   adjacent to it.
 
 
  
 
 Meanwhile, members of Make Ooty Beautiful ( ) approached the authorities and offered to renovate the building and turn it into an art gallery. And the suggestion went down well with the district administration and municipal authorities.
 
 
  
 
 “It was MOB members’ idea to turn the abandoned toilet into an art gallery. For this, we renovated the old building at a cost of Rs 2.5 lakh,” said C Ravi, Ooty municipal engineer and commissioner incharge. “Now, they will maintain the building and take care of electricity bill as well,” he added.
 
 
  
 
 The founder of MOB, Shobana Chandrasekar, said it was the result of a collective effort. “It wouldn’t have been possible without the support from the public. The renovated structure will now welcome the tourists to the hill retreat. The art gallery will showcase paintings, photography and other forms of art for three weeks a month,” Shobana said.
 
 
  
 
 Anita, another member of MOB, said the building was painted anew with the donations from the local people.
 
 On Friday, the art gallery played host to its first exhibition. Titled proximal theories of white, the exhibition features a series of water colour paintings by Rajkumar Sthabathy.
