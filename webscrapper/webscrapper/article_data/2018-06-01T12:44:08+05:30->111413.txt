INDORE: The hopes of families of five   victims were dashed on Wednesday when they were shooed away by party workers from CM  's programme. 

 According to the families, some BJP workers told them that the CM was not in the town to meet them, but to distribute welfare benefits to unorganised labourers and tendu leaf collectors. The kin of family of   of Nayakheda were the only ones who could meet the CM.
 
  Durgalal Dhakad - father of   of Badvan, who allegedly died in police custody - said, "I wanted to meet him to seek justice for my son. More than a year has passed, but no FIR has been registered against the policemen who snatched him away and left his body with us." 
 
  Dhakad had reached the venue at Rajiv Gandhi College grounds in Mandsaur around 1pm - four hours before the programme was to start. He was spotted and "pushed out", he told TOI on Thursday. "I believe he would have spared a minute for us. We just wanted to remind him that fees of Ghanshyam's children and a pucca house that he promised during his visit to our house last year were yet to be realised," he added. 
 
  Chouhan's arrival in Mandsaur, ahead of the farmers' agitation from June 1 and  's rally on June 6, had raised expectations among victims' families that he would issue orders to ensure that his promises are fulfilled. Patidar's emotions were shared by others .
