PANAJI: While speculations continue on how former St Cruz MLA   will enter the  , Monserrate, on Thursday, said that he had never asked Congress St Cruz MLA   to resign from the assembly to enable him to contest by elections on the seat.

 Monserrate told TOI that his asking Fernandes to resign is basically a rumour spread by “members of the ruling dispensation”. He said that neither his supporters nor any of his close associates had ever stated that he had asked Fernandes to resign as MLA.
 
 “In politics you never know what will happen next,” Monserrate said when asked if he will contest from St Cruz.
 
 There were reports that some St Cruz residents called on Fernandes and requested him not to resign even if Monserrate requested him to do so. 
 
 Monserrate was instrumental in getting Fernandes a Congress ticket for the 2017 assembly polls.
 
 Earlier, Monserrate had told TOI that he would contest from Panaji and defeat chief minister   in a byelection. When asked whether he will contest from Panaji, Monserrate said, “Let Panaji MLA   resign as MLA first, then I will take a call.”
 
 On Wednesday, Kuncalienker told reporters that he had offered to resign as Panaji MLA so that Parrikar could the contest the byelections.
 
 “These are speculations. I will cross the bridge when I get there,” Monserrate added. 
 
 Monserrate had told TOI that he would join the Congress and contest the byelections.
 
 Monserrate was keen on contesting the 2015 byelection from Panaji, following Parrikar’s elevation as defence minister, but, at the last minute, pulled out and backed Kuncalienker instead. He later said he would be happy to contest against Parrikar if he quit the defence ministry and returned to Panaji to battle it out in the assembly elections.
