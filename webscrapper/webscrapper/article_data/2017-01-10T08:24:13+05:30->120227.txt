 The duo, arrested for possessing 7kg of methamphetamine and five kg of ephedrine, has been in jail since their arrest in 2008. 
 
 In 2010, the sessions court had granted bail to the duo. However, after the prosecution moved the Bombay high court against the order, the relief was set aside. 
 
 The high court had said the accused will continue to be in custody until the end of their trial.

 The prosecution further alleged that on November 21, 2008, the duo was arrested by cops in Gujarat in connection with seizure of methamphetamine in Vadodara. They were then taken into custody by the Mumbai NCB. The prosecution said the investigation revealed that a third accused used to deal with the export of contraband drugs while Karapaya and Pillay used to assist him. The duo got a monthly salary for the job. 
 
 The prosecution further said the contraband seized in Mumbai was brought from the Gujarat factory by the accused. 
 
 Special public prosecutor Rupali Shinde said there were 19 witnesses in the case and that the amount of contraband found was of commercial quantity and hence the accused were convicted. The third accused, Xie Feng, is absconding, she said.
