MUMBAI: As a section of   plan to stage a dharna at   on March 14 over incentives, the   Amit Jain on Friday admitted that “some cab drivers were now earning less than what they did three years ago“. He, however, clarified that the earnings were attractive for the majority of other drivers even after reductions in incentives and daily costs.

 A section of the drivers have also given an ultimatum to go on strike from March 21 if incentives are not increased.
 
 In a statement he issued on Friday , Jain said it was possible for every driver to “maximise earnings“ by resorting to the following three factors --driving during peak demand periods, driving the entire city and not just specific areas, and never rejecting incoming ride requests.
 
 “Currently , 80% of drivers across India who are online for more than six ho urs a day make between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500 net earning, after Uber's service fee,“ he said. Commenting on the protests by drivers in a few other cities and the threats in Mumbai, Jain said: “Small numbers of individuals, who do not represent the majority of the driver community , have been preventing drivers who want to work from doing so...This year, everyone on my team, including myself, has committed to personally responding and resolving driver queries.“
 
 Drivers, on the other hand, told TOI that some of them were now living a 'hand-to-mouth' existence as the earnings had dropped and take home had gone below 50% of what they earned three years ago.
 
 A driver said, “We were attracted towards the aggregator model as earnings for driver was as high as Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 every month. But now the total earnings has dropped below Rs 30,000 and the incentives given by the aggregator firm too have dipped.“
