DUBAI:   pedalled hard on an outside court at the  . The former No.1, who rode the wave in 2016 with prime spots and playing on show courts, refused to be distracted by a smaller setting. The 30-yearold German handled the spin and angles of Italian qualifier Sara Errani and held out for a 6-4, 6-2 win.

 
 Kerber, who has lost just two matches this year - both to No.1s   and   - will be back on centre stage when she plays another former No. 1, Czech  , in the quarterfinals on Thursday. The sixth seed, who had a forgettable 2017, started the new year ranked outside the top-20, said she had experience playing on outside courts.
 
 “It’s different if you play on an outside court because it’s much smaller. It’s always a different feeling when you play on the center court,” she said, adding, “Of course it’s always nice to play on the center court, but I don’t care which court. For me it’s important to win the matches, focusing more on my opponent, on my game. It’s just about your mentality.”
 
 Kerber, back in the world’s top-10 at No.9, tagged her form to her ability to put last season behind her, or “forget 2017” as she put it. “I tried to start a new season completely, take all the experience from the last two years, especially from the last year when I learned a lot,” she said.
