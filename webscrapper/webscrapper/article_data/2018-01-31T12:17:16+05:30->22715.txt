KOCHI: Even though the construction of Rs 5 crore staff quarters completed several months ago,   haven't opened the building for accommodating doctors and staff. The only reason cited by the authorities is that escalator has not been installed so far.

 There are eight quarters in the complex and opening the quarters would have addressed the accommodation problems faced by doctors and nurses to some extent. "We had been demanding the opening of the quarters for several months. Doctors and paramedical staff are facing difficulties in finding accommodation near the hospital. So, they have to find accommodation in rented houses in faraway places. This would cause difficulties for them to reach the hospital on time in case of an emergency," a doctor with the medical college said.
 
 According the medical college authorities, shortage of funds has delayed installation of the escalator. "The government had allotted Rs 5 crore for the project. The PWD has completed all other works except that of the escalator. They cite cost escalation as the reason for not installing the escalator," said Dr VK  , principal of the medical college. 
 
 "As per the PWD estimate, it will require Rs 33 lakh more to install the escalator. We have written to the government seeking additional funds. We expect that the government may grant the fund soon," Sreekala said.
 
 Meanwhile, the construction of super specialty block of the medical college is expected to start by the end of March.
 
 The   (SEIAA) gave its nod for the project.   gave clearance for the construction of the super specialty block on January 9, 2018.
