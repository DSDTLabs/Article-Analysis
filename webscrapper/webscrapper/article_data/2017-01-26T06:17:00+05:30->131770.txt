Nagpur: Out of the 290 online applications submitted from Vidarbha region for availing loan under the Stand Up India scheme, the Dalit Indian Chamber Of Commerce Industries ( ) and Small Industries Development Bank Of India (SIDBI) have decided that only 43 cases are genuine.

 Under the Stand Up India scheme, banks will give loans from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore to SC/ST and women entrepreneurs. Online registration on www.standupmitra.in is required. This is exclusively for setting up a greenfield enterprise.
 
 In a press conference held at DICCI office on Tuesday, President Nishchay Shelke said, “We spoke to people who enrolled for the loan. Most were cases of fake information, non-seriousness for start-up or traders wanting to expand their business.”
 
 In order to provide hand-holding support to authentic cases, DICCI and SIDBI are launching a ‘Stand-Up Clinic’. The clinic will be inaugurated on January 27 at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Sanskrutik Bhawan, Uruvela Colony, Wardha Road, between 2pm and 6pm.
 
 While addressing the conference, SIDBI’s DGM PK Nath said, “A team of experts including Lead District Managers from all nationalized banks, officials from NABARD, GM of district industry centre etc will be present. We will try to tackle the business related challenges faced by budding entrepreneurs and get their loan sanctioned immediately.”
 
 For entrepreneurs to be taken seriously, they have to present convincing business cases by way of bankable projects. Shelke said, “People fail to submit a Detailed Project Report (DPR), they don’t have market availability and lack experience. We will sort out all hindrances and get them through the formalities.”
 
 This clinic is instituted to promote entrepreneurship, greenfield projects and spread awareness about Stand Up India scheme, he added.
