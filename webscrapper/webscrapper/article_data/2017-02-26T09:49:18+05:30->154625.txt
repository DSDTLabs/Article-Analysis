 Lin said, “There are different FB pages. If you want financial aid for education, post it on the ministry page and they will help you out. A girl posted about her harassment on FB, and the teacher got sacked after hearing both sides. A crime got detected after victims uploaded about their plight.”
 
 She added that despite being an Islamic nation, women have full freedom and treated equally in  . 
 
 Lin is doing her PhD on ‘Impact of new technologies on broadcast and production’ while Sweid is research fellow in English department. Both are based out at Marathwada University, Aurangabad. They were the lone foreigners at the international conference in city.
 
 Talking about their experience here, Sweid said he found India to be a place of contradictions yet fantastic. “There are high-rises and next to them you can see cowsheds. This is not seen in Damascus which has centuries old structures.”
 
 The couple had come to India around two years back soon after their marriage. “We have visited Kerala and Goa and enjoyed being surrounded by forests during the bus journey. So after the first two weeks of our marriage, we have been on honeymoon in India,” Sweid said.
