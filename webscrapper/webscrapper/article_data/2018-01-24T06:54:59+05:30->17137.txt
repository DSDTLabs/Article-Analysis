NEW DELHI: India crossed the 10-crore   in a year mark for the first time ever in 2017 with 11.7 crore flying within the country, up 17.3% from 9.9 crore in 2016. 

 Sharat Dhal, COO at  , said: “2017 ended on a buoyant note for the airline industry with a strong passenger growth in December. Despite localized issues such as bad weather conditions, poor visibility and excessive fog in various parts of the country, the domestic passenger market registered a strong growth of 17.3% in December over last year. We expect that passenger traffic will continue on the same growth path in January.” 
 
  
  
 
 However, the aviation industry is worried over failure of airport infrastructure to cope up with the growth, due to which most big airports — especially Mumbai and Delhi — are bursting at times. 
 
 They point out that low crude prices in past three-to-four years enabled them to offer low fares, which led to a massive jump in number of flyers.
