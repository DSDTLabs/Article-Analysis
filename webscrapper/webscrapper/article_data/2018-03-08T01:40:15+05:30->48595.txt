NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind   on Wednesday called upon LG Anil   to lobby for the clearance of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, which was approved by the cabinet on Tuesday.

 The Delhi government needs the LG’s approval to start the scheme, which envisages delivering ration in packets at doorsteps of the beneficiaries. Currently, people have to walk to the local fair price shops and wait in queues to get their ration.
 
 The doorstep delivery of ration will, however, increase human interface. The scheme was approved by the Delhi cabinet just two months after ration shops in the city went digital to reduce corruption.
 
 Under the digitalisation scheme, the fair price shops started using electronic point of sale devices (e-POS) from January 1. Delhi government said some of the intended beneficiaries do not get their rations when the e-POS system fails to read their biometrics. “Doorstep delivery has been planned as a solution to these problems,” said an official.
 
 After the meeting, Kejriwal tweeted, “I have urged the LG to call me if he has any clarifications.”
