COIMBATORE: A prima facie case of electrocution has after one-and-a-half years turned out to be a case of cold-blooded murder. 

 J  , 45, was found dead in a farmland in   on October 10, 2015. The farm owner, A  , 54, claimed that she was electrocuted.
 
 The Kuniyamuthur police registered a case under Section 174 CrPC (suspicious death). The postmortem report, however, revealed that Rasathi had sustained severe head injuries and had died of the same.
 
 The police investigation, meanwhile, revealed that there was a power cut in the locality during the day on October 10, 2015. The police failed to make any progress in the case and it was more or less in a stalled state.
 
 The Kuniyamuthur police resumed the investigation six months ago and conducted inquiry with the relatives of Rasathi. They told the police that she had an affair with the farm owner, Kannappan, for about 10 years and he often used to beat her with a wooden log. 
 
 The police recorded their statements and altered the case to 302 (murder) of the   and arrested Kannappan. 
 
 "There is no direct evidence in the case. But, the circumstantial evidences are strong against Kannappan," said a police officer.
