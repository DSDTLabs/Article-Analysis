HYDERABAD: Close on the heels of new directives by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences ( ) said it is planning to set up internal committees to monitor the prescription of antibiotics to patients. 

 After making it mandatory that every prescription should be approved by internal committees, the institute is gearing up to evolve a mechanism to implement the advice.
 
 “ICMR is now keen on rational use of antibiotics, and we want to adhere to those guidelines and set up committees,” NIMS director Dr   told TOI.
 
 Antibiotics being prescribed will be checked by doctors before giving to patients. Recently, a team of doctors attended the meeting in Chennai conducted by the antibiotic stewardship committee of ICMR for the southern region. 
 
 These committees will basically monitor prescriptions in case of high dose antibiotics. “It is not possible to monitor each and every prescription. We are not trying to talk about a doctor’s work, but monitoring will help in putting a tab on high dosage,” Dr   of NIMS said.
 
 She was part of the NIMS team which attended the meeting at Chennai. The ICMR protocol will be implemented in select 20 tertiary care hospitals across the country. 
 
  in Chennai, Christian Medical College, Vellore, JIPMER, Puducherry, NIMS, Hyderabad, Manipal Hospitals, Mangalore, and Amrita Institute of Medical Science, Kochi sent their teams comprising a doctor, nurse, microbiologist, pharmacist and administrator. The meeting deliberated to prepare action plans for the internal committees.
 
 According to doctors, antibiotics were “wonder drugs in the mid 20th century. Over decades, bacteria evolved to fight the drugs, particularly due to overuse. “Some antibiotics have lost their efficacy and we have very few new antibiotics. Superbugs whihc are resistant to more than one antibiotic are bouncing back across the globe,” Dr Subbalakhsmi added.
