BHAGALPUR: A new university at Munger by bifurcating the   (TMBU) is likely to be opened soon. Sources said chief minister Nitish Kumar would lay its foundation stone for which the date is likely to be finalized during his visit to Munger this week. 

 When contacted, TMBU vice-chancellor Nalini Kant Jha said on Monday, “I have already been conveyed about it verbally by the education department. I am, however, yet to receive any written communication.”
 
 The new university would initially function from the premises of RD and DJ College premises at Munger whereas Jha would officiate as the VC in charge till a regular appointment is made, sources said.
 
 Altogether 17 constituent colleges and 9 affiliated colleges of the TMBU would come under the new university, sources said and added that the process for selecting a VC, pro-VC, registrar, finance officer and other officials of the new university was under process.
 
 Earlier, widespread demands from academics besides people’s representatives of the region were made on several occasions to decentralize the TMBU by opening a new university at Munger. 
 
 JD(U) MLA from Sultanganj, Subodh Roy, said the distance from TMBU headquarters at Bhagalpur to Munger is nearly 68km whereas it’s 110km from Lakhisarai, 140km from Sheikhpura, 115km from Jamui and 85km from Khagaria. A new university at Munger would suit the TMBU colleges at Munger, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Jamui, Khagaria and Begusarai, he added.
 
 The new university would no doubt go a long way in solving the problems of students residing and studying in colleges in the districts under Munger division, Jha said and added that issues related to registration, examination, mark sheets, degree certificates, migration and others would take less time. 
 
 “It will also unburden the TMBU machinery,” he said.
