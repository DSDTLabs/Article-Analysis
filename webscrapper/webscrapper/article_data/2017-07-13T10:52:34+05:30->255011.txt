Two feminist activists rushed to the stage during a performance of  's   in Hamburg, Germany in protest of the filmmaker's alleged abuse of his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow. 

 The 81-year-old 'Annie Hall' director was playing the clarinet when the women, who were topless and covered in writing condemning Allen for alleged child abuse, went up on the stage and began shouting.
 
  
  
 The two activists from the   group, known for their provocative nude protests, tried to read a letter from Allen's adoptive daughter Dylan, who has accused the Oscar-winning director of abusing her when she was seven. But security guards pulled them offstage. 
 
 Allen and his band did not seem particularly bothered by the disruption. After security removed the protesters, they continued with their concert. Dylan first publicly accused her adoptive father of abuse three years ago. 
 
 The alleged abuse took place in 1992 when Allen was still together with Dylan's mother, actress  . Connecticut prosecutors launched a criminal investigation against Allen, but decided not to pursue criminal charges. 
 
 Dylan's brother Ronan Farrow detailed the allegations, and condemned the general press silence surrounding them.
