CHENNAI: To promote international peace and thwart the arms race, a group of  ,   (MICQ) has knitted the   measuring 14.09km. The feat was acknowledged by the   on Sunday. 

 The scarf was a joint effort of more than 700 women from across the country and knitters from Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Poland. The women had begun knitting the scarf in February at a club house in Medavakkam. The initiative supports creation of the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly.
 
 “We had set a benchmark of 1km for them to beat and this is the first record of its kind to be made,” said Rishi Nath, the adjudicator from Guinness World Records, London at the official function in the city.
 
 The products from MICQ will go to the secretary general, United Nations, heads of state of US, UK, Germany, France, Japan, China, Russia and other prominent members of UN.
 
 “We metaphorically wanted to send a message of unity by showing the work we did without any funding or resources. The women who participated came on their own because of their belief in our cause,” said Subashri Natarajan, founder, MICQ. 
 
 Last January, MICQ had come out with the world’s largest hand crocheted blanket of 11,000 square metre.
