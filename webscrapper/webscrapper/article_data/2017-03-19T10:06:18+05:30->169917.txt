GUWAHATI: Silchar MP  's online petition to make sanitary napkins tax-free has received a lot of support. The petition, started after International Women's Day, has received around 90,000 signatures so far. 

 Sushmita had written to Union finance minister   in this regard but did not get a reply. This prompted her to launch a petition. 
 
 "Though some parts of the country have already made napkins tax-free, it should be done at the national level. Everyone is helping the cause.   has tweeted it and MPs   and   have signed it. I hope it reaches the finance minister," she told TOI. 
 
 She said if condoms and contraceptives could be made tax-free, so should sanitary napkins. "I decided to start this petition after I didn't any response from the finance minister. He shouldn't think I'm doing this for political mileage," she added. According to a study titled 'Sanitary Protection: Every Woman's Health Right', around 70% women in India could not afford to buy sanitary napkins. The report also says only 12% of the country's 355 million menstruating women use sanitary napkins.
 
 "This move will impact millions of girls and women. It will make sanitary napkins cheaper for middle-class families and make them affordable for low-income families for the first time. Girls and women face a lot of stigma and embarrassment for menstruation," the MP wrote in the petition.
