MADURAI: Tension prevailed at a private womenâ€™s college in   in Madurai city on Thursday morning after a bomb   call was received by the college. However, police declared it as a hoax call after a combing operation by the   disposal squad.

 Police sources said that the call was received at the college office number around 8.30 am. An unidentified male claimed that a bomb was inside the college premises and it would go off around 10 am. Shocked college authorities dialled the police emergency number. Immediately, a police team and bomb detection and disposal squad rushed to the college.
