 Civic officials said the auditors, appointed by the BMC and also known as project monitoring agencies, were responsible for scrutinizing the quality of roadwork. But a study of 200 roads showed that they did not perform their monitoring job while road contractors were busy doing shoddy work.
 
 “Instead, they gave a clean chit to them, thus helping the contractors, in a way , to defraud the corporation. Therefore we would send them show-cause notices as well,“ said a civic official. “The notice will be sent only as a token of compliance. This is because after the first phase of the road inquiry was completed, two   were found guilty and show-cause notices were served on them.Later, they were named in a case at the Azad Maidan police station. The case was filed on April 27, 2016. In June, a special investigation team (SIT) probing the scam arrested 10 employees of the two third party auditor firms, Indian Register of Shipping and SGS India Pvt Ltd.
 
 Meanwhile, road department officials are considering to table a proposal before the civic commissioner, seeking that the two third party auditor firms' registration be suspended. “As of now, the two firms cannot bid for any contracts in the BMC. But now, we feel it's important that they should not be allowed to bid for contracts in other municipal corporations as well,“ said a road department official.
