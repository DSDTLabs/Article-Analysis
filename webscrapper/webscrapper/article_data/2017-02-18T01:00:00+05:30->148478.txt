Popular dance reality show Dance Jodi Dance just saw its finale, and the channel is already launching their next   titled,  , which will be telecast from today. If regular dance reality shows saw participants showing off their moves on a dance floor, this one is done on a rather risky platform. 

 A source from the channel says, “It is a dance-based adventure reality show. Instead of a dance floor, gutsy contestants will slip into their dancing shoes and show their prowess through thrilling and risky moves on land, water or air. The participants are passionate dancers, whose skills have given them immense popularity. Some of them will be Dance Jodi Dance contestants, besides renowned dancers and small- screen celebrities, who will be part of the show.” The show will be hosted by Deepak and will be judged by actresses   and Sudha Chandran.
