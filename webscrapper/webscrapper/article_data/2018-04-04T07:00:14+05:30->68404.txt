PANAJI: The   department, in the month of March, disconnected 1,223 connections of both domestic and commercial bill defaulters, some of whom have not cleared their dues for years. More than 60% (748) of these connections were temporarily disconnected while the rest (475) have been permanently disconnected where the meters have also been disabled. 

 Since January, the department has disconnected more than 4,300 such connections. The statewide drive has raked in around Rs 100 crore into the departmentâ€™s coffer. Directions have been issued by the chief electrical engineer to divisional offices to ensure that all arrears are recovered. After issuing notices to defaulters, the department gives consumers time to pay their arrears, failing which it disconnects power. 
 
 Since January, the department has reconnected 488 connections after consumers settled their bills. 
 
 Last month power minister Pandurang Madkaikar said arrears to the tune of Rs 200 crore were yet to be recovered from its consumers. 
 
 The commission in the Multi Year Tariff (MYT) order had approved the collection efficiency of 100% for the financial year 2018-19 and aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) loss level of 10.75%.
