Noida: A day after UP chief minister   pulled up officials for the low rate of grievance redress through IGRS (integrated grievance redress system), the   on Friday started a two-day training session for officials of the three Authorities in the district and the police.

 On Thursday, in a video-conferencing message to all the district magistrates, the CM had noted that the performance of GB Nagar in grievance redress through IGRS is one of the poorest with many complaints pending resolution.
 
 The IGRS is an online portal which gets complaints from the residents on various issues along with forwarded complaints received on the central government portal.
 
 While the complaints have to be looked into within 21 days, most of the grievances remain pending in the district. “We are holding a two-day training of police and Authority officials and they have been asked to expedite the grievance redress mechanism,” GB Nagar district magistrate B N Singh told TOI.
 
 Officials noted that most complaints including those related to the builder-buyer issue remain pending with the three Authorities — Noida, Greater Noida and   — which are out of the purview of the district administration.
 
 Singh said that the complaints were pending because they were being marked to the wrong people.
 
 “Marking of complaints is an issue as they are being forwarded to people who are not in the departments concerned with problem in question. We are training them on this account,” he said.
