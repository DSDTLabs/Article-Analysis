MYSURU: Denouncing the attack on 24-year old Vidvat allegedly by Shantinagar MLA N A Haris’ son Mohammed Nalapad and his friends, members of the Mysuru District Brahmin Youth Forum staged a protest near Chamundipuram Circle here on Wednesday.

 Stating that the attack stands as a testimony to the various attacks by Congressmen in the state, BJP leader N M Naveen Kumar said, “Over 30 Hindu youth have been killed in the state during the   rule. This shows a total collapse of law and order situation in Karnataka. The incident involving Nalapad gives ample credence to Congress’ involvement in all other attacks on Hindus.”
 
 Stating that Vidvat is the great-grandson of the illustrious Dewan of erstwhile Mysore State, K Sheshadri Iyer, the protesters said the assault on Vidvat was an attack on the legacy of the Dewan.
 
 Slamming police for failing to take cognizance of the attacks against members of upper castes, H N Shridhar Murthy said, “Incidents of attacks against members of Brahmin community has been increasing and it is sad that no cases are being registered against the perpetrators. Similar to Vidvat’s case Poornima Das, who has claimed that Nalapad threatened to kill her has had no luck with the law as her complaint was not registered by police.”
 
 CCTV camera footage of the attack was deleted and no manhunt was launched to nab Nalapad, the protesters alleged.
 
 Condemning the attack on media persons at the Cubbon Park police station on Monday, the protesters said, “Media persons were heckled by Haris’ henchmen, which only shows that we no longer live in a civilized society. A goonda raj has been established in Karnataka.”
