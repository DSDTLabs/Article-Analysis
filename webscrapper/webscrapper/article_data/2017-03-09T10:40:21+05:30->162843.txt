NASHIK: About 50,000 tonnes of grapes have been exported from the district during the current season (December-April), until March 8.

 The export season will continue till April-end and may cross the previous export figure of Rs 1.08 lakh metric tonne. 
 
 The entry of   grapes in European countries has led to a decline in prices in   and  .
 
 President of   (GEAI) Jagannath Khapre told TOI, “The grape export has crossed the 50,000 metric tonne so far. We are expecting around 20% to 25% rise in the export. Currently, the scenario is good but pricing is the main issue. This year, the grape export prices have declined in Europe from Rs 100 per kg to Rs 50-60 per kg.” 
 
 He added that in Russia too, the grapes prices have crashed from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 35 per kg due to a rise in supply in the export markets.
 
 “Earlier, Chile would export grapes to only UK only. Now, the country has entered the European and Russian market too. This has led to a drop in the grape export prices,” said Khapre.
 
 This year, the areas under grape plantation have also increased by 31% for the current grape season (December-April) 2016-17. As many as 34,023 grape farmers have registered a total of 56,200 acres for export of grapes. The last grape season, 2015-16, around 26,000 grape farmers had registered 43,000 acres of vineyards. 
 
 The total areas under grape plantation in the district are 1.75 lakh acres. Of which, Nashik district had registered the highest ever grape export of 1.08 lakh metric tonne in the last grape season 2015-16 due to good climatic conditions . 
 
 The unseasonal rains and hail had damaged the vineyards in the district during the 2014-15 grape season, affecting the export from the district by 26% to 49,768 metric tonne, against 67,244 metric tonne in the previous 2013-14 grape season.
