LUDHIANA: After lapse of more than two years, civic officials have requested the state government to release funds for the development of five parks under the Atal Mission Rejuvenation and Urban Transmission (AMRUT) scheme. The Union government has already given its share but unless the state government releases its share, the funds could not be be transferred to  . Out of the five parks, detailed project reports of two parks have already been sanctioned by the government, while three project reports are awaited. 

 The officials had prepared DPRs for the Satguru Ram   and a green belt opposite Lodhi Club. In these two parks the officials had proposed landscaping from a fresh angle. Along with this, a separate playing area for kids and yoga was also proposed. Also suggested were installation of fountains and irrigation sprinklers. The renovation of Satguru Ram Singh Park spread in 3.75 acres is expected to cost Rs 84 lakh while the   area spread across a 1.5 km long stretch will be developed in Rs 63 lakh.
 
 However the Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Corporation (PMIDC) had asked the officials to revise the DPR while mentioning that the MC would handle the maintenance work in these parks for five years. The officials sent the revised DPR and decided to outsource the maintenance of the parks as well. 
 
 MC Commissioner   said they requested the government to release the funds since they were supposed to develop five parks in five years, but till now they could not commence the work of even one. He said the government had released the funds for other developmental projects but not for the parks. 
 
 Meanwhile the executive engineer of the horticulture wing MC, Surinder Kumar told they had sent the revised detailed project report to the government, but not even a single meeting of the state-level technical committee has been convened. The DPR will be considered only after these meetings.
