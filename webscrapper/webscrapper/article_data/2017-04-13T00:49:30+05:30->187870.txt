Panaji: The state-of-the-art solid waste treatment plant at Saligao on Wednesday began supplying surplus power generated by it to the state electricity grid. 

 The plant that handles around 120 tonnes of mixed garbage on a daily basis began supplying power green renewable energyto the grid at 2 pm, Hindustan Waste Treatment Pvt Ltd director Ganesh Kandaswamy told TOI. 
 
 The plant that began functioning last year has been generating power from municipal solid waste since June last year, burning its surplus power while it waited for the government to get its act together and create the required infrastructure to connect it to the grid. 
 
 Presently, the plant generates 340kW an hour, over 7,000kW on a daily basis. Of this, the plant requires an average of 4,000 kW to run. The government will pay HWTPL for the 3,000kW at the rate of Rs 2.4 per unit.
 
 The surplus will be fed to the Saligao sub-station and supplied to neighbouring coastal villages. 
 
 Technical proposals were submitted to the electricity department and together with Goa Energy Development Agency, department of science and technology and the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation have been working overtime to ensure that the required infrastructure was in place by Wednesday, the deadline set for it, Kandaswamy said.
 
 A senior official from the electricity department told TOI that the power injected into the system would come to the rescue of nearby villages, especially when they face issues of low voltage. “There will be an improvement in voltage and the load on the line will be less with the additional supply,” he said.
