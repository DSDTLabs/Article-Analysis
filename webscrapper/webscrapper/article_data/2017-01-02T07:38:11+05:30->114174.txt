JAIPUR: The Rajasthan police on Sunday morning arrested a poacher for killing six peacocks using poisonous seeds under Phulia police station area in Bhilwara district.
 
 According to Sahdev Singh, Phulia station house officer, the cops have arrested one Goddu   for killing the birds so that their meat can be sold to roadside eateries. “We had received information that there were six carcasses of peacocks at a farm near Rupbas village. We searched the area and arrested the accused who was hiding in a nearby house,” Singh said.
 
 The accused told police that he had dipped seeds in pesticides and spread them out on a farm. “The birds came one after another and died on the spot after eating the contaminated seeds. The accused waited for the birds to die so that he could collect their carcasses and sell them to roadside eateries,” Singh added.
 
 The police said that people in the area often kill birds so that their meat could be presented as chicken in dhabas. “We are interrogating as to how many other such crimes has he committed. We are also looking for his other friends in order to keep a check on poaching in the area,” police said.
