ZIRAKPUR: The residents of   area of this town are facing a lot of inconvenience since the   division of the Railways began trial run of the double-lane tracks being laid between   and Chandigarh.

 The goods trains being run on these tracks for the purpose of the trial are too slow in passing the crossing near Dhakoli, and so long traffic jams have become a routine affair in the area. Even otherwise, traffic wouldn’t clear for up to 20 minutes at the crossing because there is no underpass, but now it has become even worse.
 
 During a visit to the area, the residents complained to TOI that the   crossing these days closed for more than 6 minutes before the arrival of any train, and once the light was green, the gate took another 4 minutes to open. This 10-minute delay was causing logjams on both sides of the barrier.
 
 Residents recalled recent instances when the public had to wait for more than half an hour at the crossing for a signal to pass. 
 
 Dhakoli unified welfare association president   said: “We are going to give a representation to the municipal council president to ask him to raise the issue with the railway authorities concerned. We are facing a lot of problems during the double-lane work. The goods trains being run for the trial are very slow, due to which a traffic jam builds up in the area and the commuters have to wait for more than half an hour to get away.”
 
 He says that by next week, the association will submit its representation to the authorities in writing to ask for an underpass at the railway crossing for the convenience of the public. The Ambala railway division has missed a seventh deadline to complete the double lane work, which has delayed two major projects approved for better connectivity between Chandigarh and New Delhi.
