GREATER NOIDA: The   ( ) on Monday reduced by 1.5% the   on installments it receives from   across all properties. 

 The cut in the interest rate is likely to come into effect soon after the decision is officially approved.
 
 Prabhat Kumar, the YEIDA chairman, said until now, an interest rate of 12% would be levied on all properties except residential ones. “Residential allotments would incur an interest rate of 10.65%. With immediate effect, the rate of interest charged will now be 10.50% across all properties,” he said. “We have decided to charge only 10.50% interest, instead of 12%, on the dues to be cleared by an allottee. As banks have reduced their interest rates, we want to pass on the benefit to our allottees,” he said.
 
 Kumar said that besides reducing the interest rates, residents or plot owners would no longer have to pay GST for many services, including sewer and water taxes, provided by the YEIDA. “The plot owners will not have to pay GST even on land cost,” he said.
 
  “About 21,000 alllottees of YEIDA will be relieved by this decision,” he added.
