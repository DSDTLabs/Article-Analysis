KOZHIKODE: Chief minister   has said that even Christian managements had become part of the education business lobby now. He was speaking at the diamond jubilee celebrations of St Joseph's College, Devagiri here on Tuesday.

 He said barring a few, most Christian managements had been influenced by the profit-making mentality now. "Christian missionaries had in the past started educational institutions in the state as a social service. But the advent of self-financing institutions has led to education being viewed as a commercial activity with scope to make huge profits. Though Christian managements initially refused to toe that line, they too have become part of the trend now, with only a few managements remaining out of it," he said.
 
 Coming down heavily on unlawful practices prevalent in the state's self-financing sector, Vijayan said the government would take strict action against those indulging in irregularities. He said some managements were taking bribes for even teacher appointments, which was nothing but corruption.
 
 "What started off as collection of small donations during teacher appointments has become auctioning of posts. Many managements have started educational institutions eyeing profits alone. Even those in liquor business have started educational institutions," he said.
 
 The chief minister said though the government had asked the vigilance department to conduct a probe into such malpractices, nobody came forward with complaints. He said the government would not allow aided educational institutions in the state to be turned into commercial enterprises.
 
 Vijayan said St Joseph's College, the first college in the country to score an A++ grade in assessment by  , has made significant contributions to the state's higher education sector. M K Raghavan MP, M K Muneer MLA, Devagiri institutions manager Fr Joseph Paikada, deputy mayor Meera Darshak, college principal Sibichen M Thomas and Fr Joseph Vayalil also spoke.
