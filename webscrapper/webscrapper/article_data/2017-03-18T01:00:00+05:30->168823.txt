 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said the police has sought their three-day remand for interrogation. “Patna police along with CID (weaker sections) will quiz the accused,” he said.
 
 Departmental proceedings: The home department on Friday gave its nod to initiate departmental proceedings against 2005 batch promoted IPS officer Sunil Kumar for violating rules and regulations during making transfers and posting of subordinate officials in East Champaran district. The order for department proceedings was given after conducting internal inquiry by the state police headquarters. Kumar’s explanation was not found satisfactory.
 
 Kumar was posted as East Champaran SP in 2014-2015 when he, without taking orders from the DIG, shifted station house officers of several police stations frequently, police headquarters sources said. Kumar is commandant of BMP-16 in Patna. He also posted a sub-inspector at a position where an inspector rank official should have been posted.
