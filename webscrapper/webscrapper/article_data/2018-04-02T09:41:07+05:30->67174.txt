CHANDIGARH: The Federation of Sectors Welfare Associations of Chandigarh ( ) has demanded early constitution of the ward committees to resolve the basic civic issues at the ward level in consultation with the area councillor.

 Foswac general secretary   has written to mayor   that the federation has come to know that the municipal corporation is considering to revive the ward committees, but the record suggests that these committees have fail to serve their purpose. He claimed in the letter that the ward committees either did not start or remained defunct for years despite of police verification of the proposed members three or four times.
 
 Gogia alleged that the committees were defunct because of the “arbitrary selection of members by the councillors, who either had no interest in social work or had no aptitude for it”. The letter says that the resident welfare associations (RWAs) were ignored, which has led to this discontent. “While the councillors show disinterest and take their time coming to the meetings, even the MC officials have a casual attitude about participation.”
 
 Foswac recommended that the representatives of the RWAs be made members of these ward committees for fruitful results. Foswac vice-chairman   said: “As four-time member in a ward committee in the past, I can say that it hardly ever met for discussion. Until there is regular meeting, the ward committee serves no purpose. The choice of the members should be left to the active participants of the committee.”
