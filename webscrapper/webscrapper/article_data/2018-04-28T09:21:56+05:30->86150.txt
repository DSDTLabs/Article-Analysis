 According to U Marimuthu, one of the petitioners, the HC ordered the government to award compensation ranging from 5 lakh to 8 lakh to the parents of the victims along with interest. On December 21, 2016, the compensation was deposited in Marimuthu's bank account. Advocate Tamilarasan went to Kumbakonam with two undated blank cheques and signed blank papers from each of the claimants. 
 
  Marimuthu received a message from the bank on December 22 that 2.3 lakh had been deducted from his account. He found that counsel had diverted the money in his account. The petitioner said each claimant had already paid 3,500 as fees totalling 3.5 lakh.
