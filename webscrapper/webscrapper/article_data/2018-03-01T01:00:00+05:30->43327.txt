The Jennifer Lawrence-starrer ' ', which releases on March 2 in India, is touted to be the Oscar-winning actress’ most mature role till date. Jennifer was hesitant to take on sexually-driven roles after 2014’s controversial photo hack, but 'Red Sparrow' finally changed her mindset.
In the film, Jennifer plays an injured Russian ballerina, who is forced to become a spy who specialises in sexual manipulation. The actress said, “It was really scary to say yes to the movie because I knew the only way to tell the story is if I agreed to really do the scenes and go full monty. It took a while to say yes and the night before, I didn’t sleep at all and I was obviously really nervous because it is the actual nightmare of standing in front of a classroom naked. But then, after I finished the scene, I felt empowered.”
 
 The critics have called the film, ‘A lavishly costumed, location-enhanced thriller’ and ‘Elegantly tense and absorbing to the last minute’ and have also praised Jennifer for her performance.
 
 'Red Sparrow', which is directed by 'The Hunger Games' Francis Lawrence, is being compared with the pacy psychological thriller 'Gone Girl' that released in 2014. The film also triumphs with its cryptic social commentary, including its subtle-yet-meaningful critique of gender issues and 21st century politics.
