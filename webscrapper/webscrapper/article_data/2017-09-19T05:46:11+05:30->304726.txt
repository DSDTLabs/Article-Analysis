AHMEDABAD: The   on Monday refused to stay   for surrender of the  ,   in a case where Jadeja and two others, have been awarded life imprisonment in connection with a 2004 murder case.

 On August 11, the HC reversed a trial court’s order of acquitting Jadeja and his two aides Amarjitsinh Jadeja and Mahendrasinh Rana, and convicted them to life imprisonment. They were asked to surrender before the jail authorities by September 30. 
 
 Jadeja rushed to the SC challenging the HC order and demanded a stay on its order to surrender.
 
 A bench of Justice S A Bobde and Justice L Nageswara Rao rejected Jadeja’s application for the stay. The bench, however, asked Jadeja to file a bail application by September 22. The state government has been asked to file its reply to Jadeja’s bail plea in a week’s time. The SC has decided to hear Jadeja’s bail plea on October 3. This means Jadeja will have to surrender by the time the apex court will take up his bail plea after the deadline to surrender.
 
 Jadeja and 15 others were chargesheeted in the murder case of Nilesh Raiyani, who was killed allegedly over a land dispute. Raiyani was shot dead on February 8, 2004 while he was travelling in a car.
 
 Earlier in 2010, a fast track court in Rajkot had acquitted Jadeja in the case. However, of the 16 accused, it had found Samir Pathan, an alleged associate of Jadeja, guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment. 
 
 Subsequently, Pathan as well as the state government approached the high court against the lower court's verdict. While Pathan pleaded innocence, the government challenged the acquittal of 15 others in the case, including Amarjitsinh Jadeja.
