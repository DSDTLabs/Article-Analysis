&TV's   (Aditi Sharma) is no more going to don the saris and simple looks that she has been until now. The character, which has impressed many by her simplicity is going to go in for a major make over.
 
  Having been essaying the role of a widow all this while in the show, Gangaa’s look was very subtle where she used to be seen in simple cotton sarees whereas now she will showcase the look of a newly wedded bride. Yes you heard it right!
  
  How she becomes a newly wedded bride is something that the viewers should watch out for!
  
  
 
  
  Gangaa will be seen shedding her widow clad look and will now be seen as an elaborate and an elegant bride. From light cotton sarees with her hair open she will now graduate to silks with embroidery blouses and tied up hair. She will also be sporting a maang teeka and a lot of bangles.
  
    said, "I am very excited about my new look in the show. There will be a massive transition in my character as well. It’s basically a 180 degree change from how Gangaa used to look."
