DEHRADUN:   (ED) sleuths on Wednesday started questioning businessman Gaurav Kumar over the recovery of foreign currency   during a raid at his premises on Tuesday.
 
  ED officials said they were probing if Kumar took demonetised currency and sold   to individuals in November last year after demonetisation.
  
  In raids conducted at multiple locations in the city owned by the Kumar family — which owns prominent commercial establishments in the city — the ED teams had seized almost Rs 69 lakh — Rs 17 lakh in foreign currency and Rs 52 lakh in Indian currency.
  
  According to ED sources, Kumar, who runs a forex services business, has links with scores of foreign money changers in Uttarakhand. ED has started accessing his phone details and scrutinising his financial transactions, property details and foreign travel details of the past six years to track involvement in  , if any.
  
  Before conducting the raids, ED sources said they had accessed Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) list of forex service consultants in Uttarakhand, but found Kumar’s forex service consultancy missing. “Without RBI approval, no foreign currency services can be offered and this company was doing business for years without any mandatory clearances,” said a senior ED official.
  
  The ED official said investigations revealed that the company had worked as a franchisee of a Rishikesh-based Full Fledged Money Changer (FFMC). “The licence of the FFMC was cancelled four years ago, but the franchisee continued its forex services operations,” he said.
  
  Meanwhile, a close aide of Kumar told TOI, "Both Gaurav and his father had gone to the ED office and are co-operating in the investigations. Their departmental store was also open as usual. They have now been called next week on Monday."
