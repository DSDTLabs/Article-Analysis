NEW DELHI: Dubbing the rejection of the removal notice against Chief Justice of India   as “illegal, ill-advised and hasty”,   leader   announced on Monday that opposition members would challenge   Chairman Venkaiah Naidu’s order in the Supreme Court.

 
 Sibal urged the CJI to not involve himself in the “listing and hearing” of the petition against rejection, arguing he could not be the judge in his own case even as he suggested the government was keen to suppress information on sensitive cases.
 
 In a point-by-point rebuttal of the rejection order, Sibal questioned how Naidu could dismiss allegations against the CJI — “antedating of an administrative order, furnishing false affidavit, conspiracy to pay bribes in   case” — without ordering an inquiry. “How can something be proved before it is proved? It can only be proved after an enquiry. So it is illegal,” Sibal said. 
 
 The escalation from the opposition camp indicated the confrontation stoked by the removal petition is unlikely to stop with Naidu’s decision. At a press conference held in the Congress office, Sibal, along with senior lawyer-MPs Vivek Tankha and Ami Yagnik, linked Naidu’s decision to the Centre.
 
 “It seems this government is very keen that this (allegations) must not be allowed to be inquired into. Maybe, by scuttling an inquiry, they do not want a lot of information to come on record,” Sibal said, in what implied that the government may seek to pressure the judiciary. Sibal accused Naidu of acting in a hastyily.
 
 Sibal said procedure required the chairman to consult the CJI but since he could not have done so in a case against the CJI, he should have spoken to members of the   collegium, which he had chosen not to. 
 
 He said allegations pertained to what was happening in the SC, about the CJI giving sensitive matters to particular judges. “So, without consulting the judge in respect of matters that happened in court, it was ill-advised of him to reject the notice,” he argued.
