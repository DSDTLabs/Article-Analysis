When it comes to style, it’s the littlest things that make a big difference. Take for instance, the humble  . It’s not just a small hanky stuffed in your breast pocket, it’s a style accent. Here are few things to keep in mind when planning on playing up the pocket square.

 
 
 There are no rules to picking a square. It’s more a gut feeling. It should complement your shirt and tie, not mirror them. It should match the broader aspect of your clothes – the colour of your suit, shirt or your tie. It can even play on patterns.
  
 
  
 As you would with a tie. For winter months and weighty clothes like flannels, tweeds or denims, pick squares in dusty (not shiny) silks, wools and cashmeres. For summer suits, pick lighter fabrics.
 
 
 
 If you want to do white, then make sure the edges carry some colour detailing for more added impact. But more often than not, pick a contrasting colour to stand out.
 
 
 
 Don’t stuff it but don’t practise origami either. Simply fold it neatly and fan it out in a way that it doesn’t seem as if you have spent hours arranging it to look just perfect. It has to have a certain degree of nonchalance to make an impact. One phrase: Imperfectly perfect. And it shouldn’t bulge your breast pocket. If it is, you need to refold it.
 
 
 
 Don’t fuss over it. It should be relaxed. It should show that you care, but not too much. Try your own style if you feel more comfortable doing that.
