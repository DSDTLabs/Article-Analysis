NEW DELHI: The government on Friday said  's acquisition of a majority stake in   was in line with the current policy on online marketplaces, where Amazon was already present. 

  "We allow FDI on (e-commerce) platforms. Flipkart is also a platform. An American company (Walmart) is investing on that platform. There is no difference between the two platforms. Just as Amazon could come, Walmart can also come through the same route," economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said at a press conference, while dismissing views of Walmart's entry into the growing retail market through the "backdoor". Garg's comments are the first by a government official, although Rajiv Kumar, vice-chairman of think tank  , had earlier said that the deal was in line with the FDI policy. 
 
 The economic affairs secretary had a similar take. "Some people are opposed to FDI even in the platform (marketplace) model. That is their view. But in the country, FDI is allowed in this segment," Garg said.
 
 Traders' lobby group   and Sangh-affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch have opposed Walmart's move to acquire a 77% stake in Flipkart in a $16-billion deal that values the marketplace at more than $20 billion. They have asked the government to reject the bid, arguing that the world's largest retailer, which is not allowed to sell directly to consumers by opening stores in India, is now using Flipkart to beat the ban on multi-brand retail.
 
  Garg dismissed suggestions of a possible misuse of the investment window by Walmart, saying: "The definition is absolutely clear, the boundaries are clearly drawn."Current rules allow investment in marketplaces through the automatic route.
