 Besides Sonika and I, was someone in the car? As far as I know, there wasn’t. I’m sure whoever is giving this information doesn’t know me. I don’t know how closely he knew Sonika. I really wish there was someone in the car who is alive apart from me.
 
 
 
 
 The question of readmission doesn’t arise since I wasn’t admitted before. The person with me was in a much more serious condition. My primary concern was to ensure her safety. Initially, her treatment was in the emergency ward. Then, she was taken upstairs. Till the time she was taken upstairs, I was in no position to get my wound treated. By the time my stitches could be completed, I was called upstairs. That happened close to 5am. After the news of her death was given to me, I was still not admitted. I was sitting in the lobby and didn’t know how to cope with the tragedy. I used the phone of the investigating officer to reach out to my father and my childhood friend Pritam. The investigating officer called up the cops who had my phone. When I gave them my phone password, the cops went through the contact list and got other numbers. That’s how Anindya (Chatterjee) was called. Pritam had informed my mother. It was daytime when Pritam arrived. It was their decision to get me admitted. I wasn’t in a frame of mind to get myself admitted. My shirt was drenched in blood.
 
 
 
 
 I have been living in Kasba for 13 years. For any emergency case, people living around Kasba usually think of going to Ruby General Hospital. From my house, the road leads to Ruby. After an accident of that nature, I was in a complete state of shock. It was a spontaneous decision to take her to Ruby hospital. The names of other hospitals didn’t occur to me then.
