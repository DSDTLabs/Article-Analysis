BENGALURU: At the peak of his career,   was the most sought-after playback singer. 

 Thirty-seven years after his demise, while his music lives on, director  's biography of Rafi, Dastan-e-Rafi, has no takers. "Such was the plight that I had to write an emotional letter to an entertainment house management to get small screen time. I was lucky, and it was telecast," recalled Acharya, whose movie was played at the 9th Bengaluru International Film Festival (Biffes). But even then the entertainment house, while playing the movie, gave it a non-peak 10am slot.
 
 Having spent Rs 55 lakh on the movie, Acharya recalled the trouble in getting copyrights for the audio and video clips of Rafi.
 
 First-time Tamil director Vijay Jayapal said selling parallel cinema to the world is a very difficult task. "Thankfully, such film festivals give directors like us visibility," said Jayapal, whose Tamil movie Revelations has been screened at eight festivals.
 
 B Suresh, whose Kannada film   was screened at Biffes, said there is a lot of scope for parallel cinema. "In the Kannada industry, many want to watch such movies. But the drawback is that they are not ready to pay exorbitant ticket prices to watch them."
