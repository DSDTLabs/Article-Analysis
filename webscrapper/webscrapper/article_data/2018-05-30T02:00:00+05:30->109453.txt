PATNA: The state government on Tuesday informed the Patna   that the police had raided the residence of high court lawyer Indeshwari Prasad Mandal to arrest his nephew Dharmendra Mandal, a murder accused, against whom an arrest warrant had been issued.

 The lawyer’s residence at Dhanaut under Rupaspur police station area was raided by a joint team of Patna and Bhagalpur police on May 26. Only lawyer’s wife Sunita Kumari was present at the house at the time of the raid. The lawyer had earlier accused the police of raiding his house without arrest warrant and misbehaving with his wife.
 
 The vacation bench of Justice Birendra Kumar had on Monday asked Patna senior superintendent of police (SSP) and SHO of Rupaspur police station to appear before the court on Tuesday in connection with the raid. SSP Manu Maharaaj and SHO Deepak Kumar were present in the court during Tuesday’s hearing.
 
 The court asked the SSP to file a counter affidavit, detailing whether all rules and regulations were followed by the police while conducting the raid or not. The matter will now come up for hearing on July 2.
 
 Additional public prosecutor Anjani Kumar, who represented the state government in the court, said Dharmendra, an accused in a murder case lodged with Babarganj police station in Bhagalpur in 2015, had been evading arrest. Kumar refuted the lawyer’s allegation that the police had misbehaved with his wife.
