KOCHI: With their image taking a serious hit for allowing 'Pulsar' Suni to play hide and seek with them for six days, the police finally compensated for it with some   by nabbing him and his accomplice from a   here on Thursday afternoon. 

 Evading police surveillance, Suni and Vigeesh -the two main accused in the abduction and rape of a popular   last Friday -had managed to sneak into the court of additional chief judicial magistrate in a bid to surrender. Even as their lawyer was presenting his petition in this regard to the magistrate who had retired to his chamber for the lunch recess, a police team barged into the courtroom, overpowered the two accused and dragged them away kicking and screaming to a waiting police vehicle in full view of assembled lawyers, many of whom tried to resist.
 
 Suni and Vigeesh were taken to   where they are being interrogated by a team of top police officers.
 
 A section of lawyers protested the police action, deeming it unlawful and cited it as an example of police brutality. Additional chief judicial magistrate Siju Sheikh subsequently directed the SHO at central police station to hand Suni and Vigeesh over to the investigating officer and to be produced in the nearest court within 24 hours.
 
 Shortly after 1pm on Thursday , Suni, living up to his reputation, reached the neighbouring Ernakulathappan ground on a black Pulsar with a Tamil Nadu registration. Vigeesh was riding pillion. They then scaled the boundary walls to enter the court complex.
 
 Suni had donned a white shirt and held a black jacket -presumably to pass off as a lawyer -and both of them didn't remove their helmets till they were inside the building. They took a lift meant only for magistrates and reached the courtroom where they took off their helmets and stood next to the witness box.
