PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Organisations focused on protecting the environment conducted a survey of the number of trees that will be affected by the Pune-Mumbai highway widening work in Dehu road Cantonment Board(DCB) . They will be submitting the report to the MSRDC.

 The seven kilometre stretch of highway from the Dehu road police station to Bhakti Shakti chowk in Nigdi is narrow and local residents have conducted many agitations in the past two decades for the stretch to be increased to four lanes to reduce traffic congestion and accidents. As a result, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation(MSRDC) started work on the project a month back.
 
 A group of around a dozen members of various social organisations measured the distance of the trees on the stretch from the middle of the highway to know whether it is affected by the widening work or not and whether it can be saved or not.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Dhananjay Shedbale, Trustee of Devrai Foundation and president of Nisarga Mitra, a wing of Savarkar Mitra Mandal said, “We are not against highway widening. Our aim is to save maximum number of trees out of the 199 trees that will be affected highway widening work. The highway is to be widened upto 11.5 meter on both sides from the centre. We want that the trees which are in the four lanes of the highway to be transplanted. If they are to be cut then three trees should be planted for each tree to be cut.”
 
 Speaking to TOI, a MSRDC official said, “The social organisations have submitted their plan which we will show to our seniors who will take a decision on it. The work of shifting the utility lines for highway widening has begun. In some areas we have also conducted widening work where there are no obstacles. We will be planting three trees for every tree that will be cut for highway widening as per regular norms.”
