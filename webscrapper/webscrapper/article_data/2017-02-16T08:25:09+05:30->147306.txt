VADODARA: A meeting between Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) general secretary Praful Patel and   (PAAS) members from central Gujarat has triggered murmurs in the political circles. 

 Representatives of both sides are likely to meet again soon to discuss the further course of action.
 
 Praful Patel and PAAS members met at PAAS core committee member Uday Patel’s residence in Godhra on Wednesday afternoon. The meeting was held after Praful Patel met the local NCP members and addressed a press conference later.
 
 NCP’s Gujarat president   said that Praful Patel had met a lot of people and these included PAAS members. “They are eager to work with us, but the future course of action will become clear only after Praful Patel’s visit to the state next week,” said Boskey.
 
 Uday said that the meeting was routine and several issues including those pertaining to   and others in the state were discussed at the meeting. “NCP leaders are exploring options to help the Patidars in the state. In his next, visit Praful Patel will meet the core committee of PAAS. He is also keen on meeting Hardik Patel,” Uday said.
 
 Uday pointed out that PAAS members were meeting several political leaders and discussing Patidar issues. “We will support whoever supports us,” Uday said.
 
 Hardik had earlier met Shiv Sena leaders in Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena had said that Hardik will be the party’s face in Gujarat polls. Hardik had, however, clarified recently that he will continue to work for the community and not enter politics.
 
 Boskey added that Praful Patel had clarified during his visit that the NCP would not support the BJP if Shiv Sena withdrew support to the coalition government in Maharashtra. “He clarified this to the media. We are willing to go in for a mid-term poll instead of supporting the BJP. Our top brass is clear on this front,” he said.
