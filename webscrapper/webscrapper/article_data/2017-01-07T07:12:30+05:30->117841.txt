KOLKATA: Driving around Salt Lake’s ‘big empty streets’ is sometimes eerie. At times, it feels like the road is leading nowhere. But the feeling of seclusion that Salt Lake is often associated with is set to change as TOI rolls out its ‘Happy Streets’ campaign on January 8 to help residents reclaim the roads.

 “Driving here is like passing through a film set after the producers pack up and go home,” rued Paramita Acharya, 20, a sociology student from St Xavier’s University. She, however, is hopeful that the township will start scripting a turnaround story with ‘Happy Streets’, when a stretch of the road will turn into an open playground. 
 
 Salt Lake residents have longed for a vibrant social life for long. Nina Sarkar, 55, who lives in the Swimming Pool area, believes things are changing. “The more the place is occupied with the young and the upcoming, the better. Bigger occupancy rate will restore confidence to live in an area that’s sometimes referred to for all the wrong reasons.” 
 
 It’s not that the township is godforsaken, many felt. There are signs of life, in fact a great deal of it, in pockets like CA, CB, CD, CE and BF blocks, where much commercial activity has taken off after City Centre was built. “The spurt in construction shows a renewed interest in Salt Lake — to repopulate a neighbourhood that was once written off as a ‘glorified old age home’,” said  , a social activist. 
 
 Septuagenarian resident Arunava said, “It was fanciful to expect that you could develop a neighbourhood by keeping people indoors most of the time. Our high streets have a great future, let’s get on them.”
 
 “We’re keeping the streets clean, rebuilding footpaths and routinely planting trees so people are encouraged to walk or cycle through,” said Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta. Refurbishment is the newly formed Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation’s preferred option for the streets.
