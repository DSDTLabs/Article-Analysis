PATIALA: With even the rich farmers in the state showing little interest in giving up the power subsidies, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited ( ) has asked its sub-divisional officers to coax at least one rich farmer in their jurisdictions to voluntarily surrender the agriculture power freebies.

 As per the latest circular issued by the PSPCL, it has asked its assistant engineers and assistant executive engineers to work on this. Besides, the power corporation has asked its officials posted at the divisional head offices to ensure that at least five tubewell consumers of their division surrender the agriculture power (AP) subsidy.
 
 The PSPCL stated that due efforts were to be made by officials for motivating AP consumers and influential people of the society including rich farmers, farmhouse owners, businessmen, corporate houses, educational institutes and trusts and religious sects to surrender the power subsidy.
 
 It was in January, this year, that the state cabinet had notified a new policy to charge farmers, who voluntarily surrender their power subsidy, at a flat rate of Rs 403 per BHP for each month. As per the policy, the farmers were also offered an option to give up their subsidy by 50% or by 100%.
 
 After coming to power in March last year, chief minister   had made an appeal to well-off farmers in the state to give up the free power. However, the appeal had failed to invoke much response from the farmers as only two, including his political rival and   Sukhpal  , who has nine tubewell connections in his name and  , principal of the   filed the applications with the PSPCL to give up their power subsidies. 
 
 In June, last year, Amarinder had also announced to give up free power for his farmhouse. But as no policy to bill the farmers was in place, the PSPCL had not issued any bills of the farmers.
