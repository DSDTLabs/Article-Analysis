PATNA: The Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen   (JMB) terrorists, who had allegedly planted three improvised explosive devices (IED) in   on January 19, aimed for maximum casualty of Buddhist monks by triggering blasts with the help of three different techniques.

 Intelligence sources said these techniques were different from the ones adopted in 2013 blasts at Bodh Gaya and   in Patna. In those blasts, Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists had used the techniques suggested in an al-Qaida magazine. At Gandhi Maidan, water supply pipes and household light bulbs were used along with analogue timer, while at   in Bodh Gaya, mini cooking cylinder and timers were used for detonation.
 
 In the recent low-intensity blast near the Mahabodhi Temple, the IED was kept in a plastic lunch box placed below a generator set near   ground. Sources said the first IED exploded due to timer mechanism. “It had an analogue watch as timer. Another mechanism – pressure release technique – was also used. Had anyone opened the box before pre-set time, it would have exploded,” sources said, adding the IED exploded only partially due to malfunctioning.
 
 “Ammonium nitrate-based explosives and mining detonators were used,” sources said.
 
 The remaining two IEDs were concealed in bags in styrofoam plates and placed near gate number four of the Mahabodhi Temple and below a tree near the Tibetan monastery, where Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai   was staying.
 
 Sources said pressure technique was used in two IEDs, which did not explode. “An X-ray image of one of the IEDs recovered from near the temple gate showed absence of timer device in it,” sources said.
 
 The investigating agencies were also perplexed with designs of the two IEDs. “They were created using two thick metallic plates bolted by four screws. All explosive mechanisms were fitted in between. The plates would have acted as shrapnel,” sources said.
