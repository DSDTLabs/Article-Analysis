NEW DELHI:   is planning to start an undergraduate degree in  . Sources said the   administration has granted approval, but a nod from the funding agency, University Grants Commission ( ), is pending.

 The new addition will reflect in the prospectus of the college that will be released along with the Delhi University admission notice this year if UGC gives a positive response within the next few days, otherwise it will be included next year.
 
 Currently, St   offers 10 undergraduate programmes, including economics, English, history, philosophy, maths and chemistry. This is in addition to the nine postgraduate courses available at the college.
 
 Being a minority institution, St Stephen’s releases its own prospectus and form that applicants are expected to fill along with the centralised DU form. The Delhi University admission process is expected to start next week. It has already been delayed by nearly 15 days. Members of the DU admission committee said that the delay is being caused by “bugs” in the online portal. This needs to be resolved so that the admission process is streamlined and smooth.
