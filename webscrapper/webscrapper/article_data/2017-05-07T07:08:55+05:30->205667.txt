KANNUR: Wildlife enthusiast   never thought that his teacher PK  's information would lead him to a rare sight-a king cobra hatching eggs at a cashew plantation near a human habitat in Kottiyur. 

 "It is a rare phenomenon as king cobras normally build their nests far away from human habitat and I have taken it as a mission to protect the nest till the eggs hatch. Then we can indulge in relocation. In the history of modern India, only 25 such instances were recorded and the last one was in   in   in 2013," said Neelakantan, who has a field experience of 16 years.
 
 Forest officials said measures have been taken to protect the king cobra till the eggs are hatched. "A resident had set fire to the area after seeing a king cobra building its nest. I was shocked because it builds nest to lay eggs. On searching the location, I spotted a nest a few meters away. The snake slithered away, apparently fearing that the place would be set afire again," he said. He inspected the nest and found 20 eggs. "We asked forest officials not to disturb the nesting area. From appearance, it seems the cobra is laying eggs for the first time. The small nest of nearly 1.5ft high, seems the snake was in a hurry. If the eggs are touched by human hands, it will not hatch and hence the best way is to hatch it here. I have promised the people to visit the place one a week and take care of everything," said Neelakantan, who works in the hospitality industry.
 
 "I choose resorts in forest areas because I can spend quality time in the wild. I change locations every two years," said the wild life enthusiast.
