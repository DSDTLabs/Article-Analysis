Panaji: After the Class XII results were declared on April 28, the admission process for undergraduate programmes in colleges across Goa will begin from Wednesday. Colleges offering degree programmes are expected to be swarmed by students, as most institutes kept the process on hold for a day with Tuesday being a Labour Day public holiday.

 As the Class XII results were declared only on Saturday, the process of distribution of marksheets to schools by the state board and then by the schools to students could only take place on Monday. A public holiday on Tuesday put the beginning of the first year degree programme   off by another day.
 
 Most of the colleges, including prominent institutes like Panaji’s Don Bosco College, Mapusa’s Saraswat Vidyalaya's College of Commerce & Management Studies, and the capital city’s Dhempe College of Arts & Science began giving out their admission forms and prospectus on April 28 itself. But the admission process in these institutes will begin only on Wednesday.
 
 The frenzy for first year seats is expected to be higher this year, as over 15,000 students have cleared the Class XII state board exam. The figure is the highest ever, up by around 400 since 2017.
 
 Some colleges like Carmel College of Nuvem, Rosary College of Navelim and   of Margao have made their admission prospectus and forms available online. 
 
 “Students have to enroll themselves by filling the form online and answer the entrance exam. Once the merit list is out, students will have to come to the college to complete the rest of the formalities,” a staffer at Smt Parvatibai Chowgule College said.
