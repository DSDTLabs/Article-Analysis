  "This is a film I feel very proud to be associated with. Both Vandana and the script, are unique and have something important to say. What drew me to this script was, that it touches upon themes, very few films have had the courage to address. And after doing a version of Macbeth in 'Veeram', it also gave me a chance to dive into another Shakespeare classic, Merchant of Venice," Kapoor said.
 
  The film will be completely shot in idyllic Mussoorie and will also feature actors Ali Haji,  ,   and Shaan Groverr. The film is produced by Yoodlee Films.

  "Bullying is a dysfunctional addiction that society is slowly but surely coming to terms with and insisting that it is no longer acceptable. Noblemen gives us a glimpse inside the bully's and the bullied person's minds. Having studied and lived in a boarding school, I know how important it is to want to fit in and how easy it is for bullying to flourish. This film is a dramatic representation of that world, its issues, adolescence and the loss of innocence," Kataria said.
