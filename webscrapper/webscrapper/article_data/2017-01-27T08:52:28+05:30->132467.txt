HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh government has come under the scanner for dropping Japanese company   as the master architect for the construction of its capital  . The   under the Union human resources department has sought an explanation from the TDP government as to why the firm was dropped after it submitted the model designs.

 “We sent a note to the state government after we received a complaint from Maki and Associates that they were dropped as the master architect for Amaravati,“ vice president of the council,  , told TOI. The Council of Architecture is a statutory body to monitor professional standards in architecture.
 
 The Japanese firm was selected as the master architect in March last year. Sources claimed that the AP government dropped the firm after criticism from several quarters that the preliminary designs were not up to the mark.
 
 In his letter to the council,  , the principal architect of the company, alleged that their removal was done fraudulently . He accused the TDP regime of unfair practice and lack of transparency . Upset over the selection of Foster and Partners, the Japanese firm termed it as a `choreographed appointment'.
 
 Maki also informed the council that the AP government representatives, during their visit to their Tokyo office in July last year, insisted that they work with Hafeez Contractor, a Mumbai-based designer, as the local architect. The company said it acceded to the demand despite having its own Indian collaborator.
 
 In spite of obliging with all the demands, AP issued a termination notice in October last year citing problems like “adverse public reaction, disproportionate fee and concerns towards executing the project in the given time frame.“ The council is now awaiting a response from the AP government.
