Patna: Parents of an 11-year-old cancer patient have written to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking monetary assistance for the treatment of their son or euthanasia for the family of four including another seven-year-old son.

 Patient Tarun’s father Santosh Kumar is an electrician who earns not more than Rs 7,000 per month. “Doctors say a bone marrow transplant costing Rs 10-12 lakh can save my child,” the 38-year-old Rukunpura-Patna resident said on Wednesday and added he had already spent all his savings on the treatment of his son so far.
 
 Tarun complained about severe pain in his joints in March 2017. After a series of medical tests at the PMCH, he was diagnosed with leukaemia (blood cancer). The PMCH doctors assured Santosh that his son would do well if he underwent regular chemotherapy. “We later went to Dr Avinash Kumar Singh of the Paras-HMRI hospital where my son has gone through two chemotherapies,” Santosh said and added his health improved initially, but started deteriorating after the second therapy in November last year. “Now, Dr Singh says only a bone marrow transplant can save my child,” said Santosh who has already taken loan from his relatives for the treatment earlier, while the state government gave him Rs 60,000 for the purpose. “We cannot see our child die every day... His body is turning black as his haemoglobin level has plummeted precariously below the normal,” Tarun’s mother Shweta Devi said and added it was why they wrote to the President and sought mercy killing for the family.
 
 Dr Singh told TOI not all leukaemia patients needed bone marrow transplant. “Tarun’s is a rare case. His body takes more than a month against the normal one week to generate white blood cells. His condition deteriorated after the second therapy. We can’t go for the third high-dose therapy as it may prove fatal,” the doctor explained and added a bone marrow transplant was a must before the next therapy.
