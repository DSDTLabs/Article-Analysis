 The fact came to the fore during a review of various activities of the directorate undertaken by additional chief secretary, medical education,  . “The facts came to the fore in a preliminary inquiry. A special secretary rank officer has been appointed to conduct the probe and find out who the wrongdoers were,“ she said.
 
 Officials stated that the problem was spotted when several regular employees in group C and group D complained that their due promotion was not given. The scam was unearthed in the process of finding out the reason why these employees were not given promotion.
 
 No harm will, however, be done to those who got selected as of now. “Those appointed got the job in the compassionate ground quota and it appears that they are innocent. Future course of action would be decided on the basis of detailed report,“ she said.
 
 The special secretary's committee will also examine the financial burden of the administrative anomaly which led to the problem.
