Kolkata: It was a knock on the doorway to life. But it didn’t sound on the door. Harivansh Agarwal heard the knock on the window facing the street. Resigned to fate till the moment before, the sound of bare knuckles on the reinforced glass kindled hope that had all but ebbed out. 

 Trapped in a fourth-floor room of Hotel Golden Parkk with physically disabled wife Bina, Harivansh could feel death curl into the room through the AC vents. It was dark but there was no mistaking the smoke that gradually filled the room. Then, when all seemed lost, he heard the knock and spotted a silhouette on the other side of the glass.
 
 “I was feeling so helpless. There was nothing I could do. The entire corridor was engulfed in smoke so there was no way I could take the stairs with my disabled wife. I tried breaking the window panes in the room but could not. I did not have the strength to break the glass,” said the sixty-four-year old businessman from Jharkhand. 
 
 “We were sitting on the bed, waiting for the end to come when we heard the tap on the window. It was a fireman checking if there was anybody inside. There was no power and our room was dark and nobody from outside could see anything inside. I jumped up and knocked on our side of the window to indicate that we were trapped inside,” said Harivansh, his eyes welling up as he recounted the tale of horror and hope. 
 
 The fireman called out to his colleagues for help and then smashed the glass with a hammer. They first rescued Bina. “Though I was left alone as they carried Bina down, I didn’t feel afraid any more. Instead, I was glad that Bina was safe. But the air was heavy and breathing was difficult. By the time they returned to rescue me, I was barely conscious. The next thing I remember was that I was lying on an elevated platform and people were trying to revive me,” he said. 
 
 The fireman had gifted him and his wife a second life.
