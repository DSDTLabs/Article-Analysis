NEW DELHI: Former   HC judge and the ‘seniormost’ judicial member of National Green Tribunal Justice Raghuvendra Rathore on Tuesday approached the   seeking modification of its order by which he was superseded and a junior judicial member appointed as acting chairperson of the tribunal. 

 
 The SC had in March appointed former   HC judge and a judicial member of NGT Justice Jawad Rahim as the acting chairperson of the tribunal after the Centre informed the court that Justices Rahim and Rathore were appointed in NGT on the same date. The court chose the name of Justice Rahim after the Centre said he ranked senior to Justice Rathore in appointment as a high court judge. 
 
 Alleging that the Centre had “misinformed” the court regarding his seniority, Justice Rathore said he joined the tribunal a fortnight before Justice Rahim and seniority of a member should be decided on the basis of the joining date. He alleged that Justice Rahim was the third in the seniority list of judicial members in the tribunal. 
 
 “The appointment of the judicial members is to come into effect only on the date when the said judicial member joined office. The applicant herein joined the tribunal on January 16, 2016. Justice Sonam Phintso Wangdi joined the tribunal on January 22. It is to be noted that Justice Jawad Rahim joined his office only from February 8,” he said in his petition while countering the Centre’s stand that he and Justice Rahim were appointed in NGT on the same day. 
 
 Advocate  , appearing for the former judge, told a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and M M Shantanagoudar that the seniority rule must be followed and pleaded for an urgent hearing. He said the SC order on the appointment must be stayed as it would establish wrong precedent of bypassing the seniority rul
