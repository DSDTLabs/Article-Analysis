KANYAKUMARI: DMDK women’s wing leader   Vijayakanth has held the government responsible for the death of fishermen from Kanyakumari in  . She said that timely information to those in the deep sea about the cyclone could have prevented their deaths.

 “They would have gone to the nearest shore and been safe,” she said. She was talking to reporters after meeting families of affected   in Kanyakumari district. After consoling the kin of dead she said that the government should be technologically sound to prevent such incidents.
 
 She said that there are countries that have the technology or are equipped with helicopters and other means to alert fishermen in the sea who could be in danger due to bad weather. “When Kerala is doing so much for the affected families, why not the government of  ?” she asked and added that the state and Centre should give a   for them.
 
 “Unstable government in Tamil Nadu is reason for its inability to rise to the occasion.
 
  It is sad to see many condolence banners in every street. Instead of insisting on finding bodies, the government should provide relief funds for families of missing fishermen, government job for a member of the family and take care of the education of their children,” she added.
