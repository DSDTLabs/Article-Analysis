LONDON: As one of his final acts of kindness, British theoretical physicist   paid for a grand Easter meal for hundreds of homeless and needy people in his home city of Cambridge.

 The funeral of the world famous scientist, who passed away peacefully at his home on March 14 aged 76, took place in the city on Saturday. On the same day, a donation from his family helped to fund the charity FoodCycle's   at  .
 
 Flowers were left on all the tables with a note reading: "Today's lunch is a gift from Stephen. From the Hawking family." Organisers said the physicist was given "a little cheer" before nearly 50 diners enjoyed the meal.
 
  
  
 "Lucy Hawking (daughter) contacted me and mentioned that the family would like to make a donation so that while the funeral was taking place, people would be sitting down to a hot meal 'on Stephen. It was a really kind gesture that I think fitted well with the sympathy Prof Hawking felt for people who were having a tough time of things," said Alex Collis, East of England regional manager, FoodCycle.
 
  
  
 Collis said the generous donation would go on to provide hundreds of meals for older people, refugees, people with mental health issues, and the long-term unemployed, besides the city's homeless.
 
 Hawking's gesture has left many social media users expressing their heartfelt gratitude while remembering the iconic personality.
