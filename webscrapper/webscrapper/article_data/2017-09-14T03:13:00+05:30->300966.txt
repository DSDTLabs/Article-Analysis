Panaji: A former government engineer has been appointed by the state government to study the   supply network in Goa. After a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, chief minister Manohar Parrikar said that the engineer will point out problems keeping the state from achieving 24x7 water supply to consumers, despite more than adequate water being treated everyday.

 Parrikar said that the engineer has been appointed as a consultant, initially for six months, but the contract will be extended. He also said that leakages in the water distribution network seem to be a major hindrance in achieving 24x7 water supply in Goa and added that the tail-end users are the worst affected. “Mainly it is the tail-end consumers who are suffering. It is the inefficiency and bottlenecks of the distribution network. The engineer, Shrikant, appointed has worked on the water supply network before and knows it well. He has already started work and will give us recommendations to plug the leakages with each report. I have already received two such reports,” Parrikar said.
 
 Based on this study, it will take around two years for the results to show. He said that once the leakages in the water distribution network are plugged, most parts of the state will receive adequate supply within this period, if not 24x7 water supply..
