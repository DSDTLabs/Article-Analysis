GURUGRAM: Robbers struck again at  , this time in Gurugram, and looted some 32kg gold, worth about Rs 9 crore, at gunpoint from the vaults of the gold loan company on Thursday. This was the sixth time in less than six months that robbers have looted gold from the finance company's branches. 

 Around noon on Thursday, a gang of eight armed men targeted the New Railway Road branch of Manappuram Finance in Old Gurgaon and cleaned up the vault which had 32kg of gold. They also took away Rs 7.8 lakh in cash.
 
 Manappuram, a non-banking finance company with its headquarters at Valappad in Thrissur, Kerala, has about 3,200 branches across 25 states. On January 5, a branch in Chhattisgarh was looted. Last year, robbers struck at Manappuram branches in Kolkata, Thane, Nagpur and Jalandhar. Robbers have looted about 150kg gold worth over Rs 40 crore in the six strikes since August 2016.
 
 The Gurgaon branch is located on the first floor of a building opposite Lal nursing home. The ground floor houses the Lalit Dental Care Clinic. At 12:05pm, a man entered the branch, giving his Aadhaar card as identity proof. While he was doing that, another man, who was with him, tried to push his way in. When the guard stopped him, he hit the guard on the head with a sharp weapon. At that point, six other gang members rushed in.
 
 It was a scene straight out of a classic heist movie. First, the gang broke the rifle of the second guard and thrashed him. Then they smeared the   cameras at the Old Gurgaon branch office of Manappuram Finance with Holi colours, before pulling out their guns and ordering the panicky staff and shocked customers to stand quietly against the wall of the strong room.
