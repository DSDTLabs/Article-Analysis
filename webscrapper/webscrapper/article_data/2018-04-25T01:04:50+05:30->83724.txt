NEW DELHI: A   destroyed nearly   at   in   Sector 28 on Tuesday, injuring a few people and leaving  . This was barely 24 hours after a devastating fire had killed a six-year-old girl and   over 300 shanties at Mansarovar Park. 

 Fire brigade officials said they received a call around 11am and sent 10 fire tenders to the spot. When the fire couldn’t be doused even after half an hour, 15 more fire engines were deployed. The blaze was controlled over two hours later. Cooling operations went on for another hour after that. 
 
 A week ago, another slum barely 50 metres away had been reduced to ashes in a fire. “We had thanked god because the fire didn’t reach our homes. Who knew that we will be struck by something worse,” said one Chameli while trying to salvage whatever she could of her burnt books. 
 
 “My sister and I bought books this morning and now we are homeless. People ran helter skelter, seeking help. The fire destroyed all before help could reach,” said one Payal.
 
 Fariyaz, another resident, claimed the fire tenders came 90 minutes after the blaze. He said the blaze started from a house that was locked up as the occupant family was out of station. “We tried to douse it with water but it spread fast and we had to leave,” Fariyaz said, adding that a few people were injured in cylinder blasts. 
 
 Police officers suspect the fire began due to a cylinder blast in the first place. They have registered a case and are investigating. The affected families would be shifted to makeshift tents nearby, officials said on Tuesday evening.
