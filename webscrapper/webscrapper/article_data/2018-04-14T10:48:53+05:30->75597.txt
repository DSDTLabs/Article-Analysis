ROME:   & Mahindra on Friday announced the launch of its electric luxury   brand  . The limited edition car will be priced just under 2 million euros.

 
 The first model of the car, which will hit the markets in 2020, will be an hypercar. 
 
 The luxury car-making unit will be based in Europe and will merge Pininfarina’s automotive design capabilities with Mahindra’s electric vehicle expertise. 
 
 The company plans to manufacture a little under 100 units of the hypercar to maintain exclusivity. Michael Perschke, CEO of the company, said the hypercar can cover 0-100 kmph in two seconds and 300 kmph in 12 seconds. It will have a top speed of 400 kmph.
 
 The company’s announcement was made a day before the Formula E series round in Rome, where the Mahindra Racing team has a formidable showing. The race be will run on a 1.77 mile circuit through the streets of the city.
 
 Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, said while a segment of car buyers gravitate towards pure functionality, the other side go for cars purely for emotion and the freedom that they offer. “You will always have cars which are objects of desire. But in future, beauty (of cars) will be described as something that is sustainable,” he said.
 
 Mahindra pointed out that his group was the pioneers in electric mobility in India with the acquisition of Reva. “However, we have never been in the area of luxury cars; hence this coming together with Pininfarina. We will bring to the table not just financial resources and stability, but also engineering know-how, trust and integrity,” he added.
