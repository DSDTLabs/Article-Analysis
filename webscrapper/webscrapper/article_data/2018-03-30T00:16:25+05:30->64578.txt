New Delhi: The sight of a 28-year-old man in tattered clothes riding a   bicycle in Sultanpuri caught the eye of a patrol cop on Wednesday. On inquiry, the policeman discovered that the man was allegedly a substance addict who would steal high-end   along with a friend and sell them for drug money. A total of 46 high end bicycles were recovered from their possession.

 Alok Kumar, joint CP (crime), said that a team, led by ACP Jasbir Singh, was formed to crack the case after the man, Amit Kumar (27), was caught red-handed. Police said that when Kumar was asked to verify the ownership of the bicycle, he could barely speak a word properly. On questioning, he confessed that he stole high-end cycles with his friend Saleem (28).
 
 A raid was conducted by the team and Saleem was nabbed from a godown where the two men disposed of the   goods.
 
 Kumar and Saleem told cops that the bicycles were stolen from upscale localities in Rohini and Prashant Vihar, and sold at a meagre Rs 300-400. They said that it was easier for them to steal them as the owners used to park them in open along with their car without a proper lock or chain due to non-availability of space.
 
 The accused told the cops that they were working with another person, who is still at large. The recovered stolen vehicles are being verified from the respective police stations, police said.
