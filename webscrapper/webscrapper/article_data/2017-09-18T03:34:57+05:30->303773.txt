NOIDA: Scores of parents held a candlelight vigil at   on Sunday to demand justice for seven-year-old   Thakur and nine-year-old  . 

 Pradhyumn was murdered on the premises of Ryan International School, Bhondsi, Gurgaon on Sepember 8, while   died after he slipped and fell on the floor of GD Goenka School, Ghaziabad on August 1.
 
 Parents gathered at Noida Stadium in Sector 21 around 6pm and marched till the stadium’s gates after observing a two-minute silence for the two children.
 
 They ended the peaceful march after placing candles at the gates of the stadium. Nearly 20 children had also accompanied their parents in the protest.
 
 “All the parents expressed their concern over safety of school children inside and outside school premises. While the parents had not got aggressive after Armaan’s death, the latest Ryan incident has shaken them and they are angry,” Yatendra Kasana, president of All Noida Schools Parents Association, which led the candle march, told TOI. “We all expressed our concern on the safety measures inside schools,” Kasana added.
 
 Parents of children studying in 10 major schools of the city, including Apeejay School, Sector 14A, Cambridge School, Sector 27, Bal Bharati Public School, Sector 21, Modern School, Sector 12 and DPS, Sector 30 came together at the protest.
 
 “The safety of children, and not money making, should be the priority of all schools. We are angered and sad at these incidents and want a swift probe into the matter,” said a parent whose child studies in DPS Sector 30.
 
 While the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a peti-tion moved by Armaan’s parents demanding a CBI probe into their son’s death, the Haryana government has agreed to hand over the Pradhyumn murder probe to the agency after continuous pressure from latter’s parents.
