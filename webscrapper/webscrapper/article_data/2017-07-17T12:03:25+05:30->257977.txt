INDORE:   (DHE) will begin its third phase of   for under graduate courses from July 19.

 July 17 is the last day for colleges to report about the status of vacant seats after the second counselling. The will also have to complete their admission process for second counselling on July 17. 
 
 After the second counselling nearly 60% under graduate seats at the prominent colleges of the city are filled. The colleges in the city expect that their seats will get completely filled after the third counselling. 
 
 “All most all the seats allotted during the second counselling have been filled and students still have a chance in the third counselling and later on in the college level counselling if seats will be vacant by then,” Govt Holkar Science College administrative officer RC Dixit.
 
 While a number of colleges in the city follow DHE counselling system for admission, the colleges, which have attained minority status, have been exempted from the counselling system.
 
 The minority colleges are nearing towards closing down their admissions for various courses. Prominent minority colleges have already closed their admissions for the new academic year. 
 
 A number of students applied in popular minority colleges of the city to avoid the tiring admission process of DHE. “I applied for the first counselling, but did not get admission and the process was so confusing and tiring all the more that I preferred to go for a direct admission in a college that has attained minority status,” said an undergraduate aspirant from the city Neeraj Vyas.
