ULHASNAGAR: A businessman has been left with a fracture to the nasal bone after he was allegedly assaulted by employees of a petrol pump in   on Wednesday night. The police said that the businessman,   (40), had objected after he was shortchanged for fuel at the pump. He has been admitted to hospital. 

 
 Gupta had gone to Bharat petrol pump near   in Ulhasnagar. 
 
 He told TOI that the attendant at the pump started tanking up his two-wheeler without the meter reading showing the mandatory 'zero'. "When I pointed that out, the attendant insisted that he would fill the right quantity of petrol," said Gupta who had paid up Rs 160. "But he stopped filling petrol at a reading which was lower than what he had charged me." 
 
 Gupta objected again, this time accusing the attendant of cheating. He alleged that the staff dragged him into their cabin where they continued to assault him. "My nose started to bleed," said Gupta who later lodged a complaint at   police station. While one of the alleged assaulters, Harish Katre (20), has been arrested, three other unidentified persons have been named in the complaint. 
 
 When Gupta threatened to lodge a police complaint, the staff allegedly told him that the petrol pump "belongs to a policeman".
 
 Last year, an Ambernath resident had lodged a complaint against this pump for dispensing less petrol.
