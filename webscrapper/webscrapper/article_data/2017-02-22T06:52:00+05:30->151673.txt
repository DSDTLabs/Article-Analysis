NOIDA: A 19-year-old girl committed suicide after she was allegedly molested by two youths in   village on Monday. The family members of the victim cremated her body without informing the police.

 Local residents said two youths of the same village molested the girl while she was going to the market. 
 
 “The girl returned home and informed her family members. However, the elders of the family held a meeting and hushed up the matter. The victim was not happy with the family’s approach and she committed suicide,” a resident said.
 
 Ummed Singh, SHO of Phase III police station, said the police have not received any complaint in this regard. “We will investigate the matter once we receive a complaint,” Singh said.
 
 Friends and relatives flocked to the victim’s house when they heard the news. The family members are yet to file a complaint with the police. They also refused to talk to the media about the incident saying it was their personal matter.
 
 Last week a Delhi court acquitted nine people for the alleged gang rape of an MBA student in 2009, when she was returning from a Noida mall. The accused were residents of the same Gadhi Chaukhandi village. The court freed the accused owing to lack of evidence against them.
