Surat: A Youth Congress leader was booked at Kapodra police station on Monday for allegedly conspiring to block the mobile phone sim card of another Youth Congress leader during the senate elections of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU). Police registered the offence five months after a written application was submitted by the complainant.

 Police booked Sunil Mehta for his alleged involvement in getting the mobile sim card of Bhavesh Rabari blocked on August 13 during the senate elections. 
 
 Rabari had alleged in his complaint that Mehta and associates made calls to the mobile service provider and requested it to block his mobile number. Rabari, a senate and syndicate member of VNSGU, is also a municipal councillor of Surat Municipal Corporation.
 
 “They made calls requesting Vodafone and provided some verification details after which the company blocked my sim card on the day of the senate elections. It was done intentionally to defeat me in the elections since Mehta’s close supporter was contesting against me from the law faculty,” Rabari said. “Police should book others accused involved in the conspiracy and arrest them. Not only did police delay registering the complaint but were also helping the other accused,” Rabari alleged. tnn
