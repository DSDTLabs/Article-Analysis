MUMBAI: Going one step ahead of the  , which has already announced its decision to give property tax relief to flats with a carpet area of less than 500 sq ft, the   has demanded that the waiver be ex- tended to homes with a carpet area of up to 750 sq ft.

 Speaking the legislative assembly on a discussion on Mumbai’s Development Plan, BJP MLA   said that flats with an area up to 750 sq ft should be exempted from paying property tax. This will lead to a burden of Rs 650 crore on the BMC. There are nearly 14 lakh units of flats that are under 500 sq ft that pay property tax of Rs 350 crore and 2.92 lakh flats up to 750sq ft that pay property tax of Rs 265 crore. Opposition leaders said that several builders have been consulted by   officials before the   was drawn and the entire process is mired in controversy. “The officer who was in charge of the department was meeting developers daily,” said NCP MLA Jitendra Avhad.
