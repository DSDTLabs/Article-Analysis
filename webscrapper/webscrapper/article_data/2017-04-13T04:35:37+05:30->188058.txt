Calangute: The tourism department’s ongoing drive may have deterred hawkers and vendors from harassing tourists on beaches during the day at   beach. Come sunset, however, and it is quite a different scenario.
 
  Negligible police presence during dusk means that several vendors, including girls as young as 10, can continue to sell their ware much past midnight along the popular North Goa beach. Young children and adolescent girls hawking goods late into the night not only raises questions about their safety but also highlights the nonchalance of the police and the tourism department in finding an effective way to keep the ‘queen of Goan beaches’ hawker-free.
  
  TOI found several young boys and girls weaving through a maze of tables and chairs on Calangute beach on Saturday nightwhen hordes of domestic tourists usually descend into the areato sell radium bangles and neck pieces.
  
   , a girl of around 10 years, who was seen loitering along the shore with a stack of illuminated bangles, said she had managed to sell around eight by midnight. “I have come with my mother and aunt, who are also selling bangles, and will go home soon,” she said, declining to be photographed. “I never allow anyone to photograph me,” she said, proceeding to a group of five men to sell her ware.
  
  However, little Jayashree, along with another girl of her age, was seen on the beach well after 12am.
  
  When contacted, tourism minister,   ‘Babu’  , said he wasn’t aware that hawkers visited beaches during the nights, too. “I will have to see what can be done,” he said.
