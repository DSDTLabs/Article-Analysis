AHMEDABAD: In one of the first significant cases after the Gujarat DGP’s notification about   seizures worth more than Rs 5 lakh, a consignment of IMFL worth Rs 33 lakh was seized near   by a team of Ahmedabad Range’s RR Cell. This is the second major seizure involving the same modus operandi, said investigators.

 
 Police sources said that, working on specific information, a team stopped a vehicle that appeared to be an LPG   and asked the driver and cleaner to open the storage tank. After their initial reluctance, they opened the tank, which was filled with cartons of IMFL. It took officials two hours to unload and inventory the stock. Officials said the traffickers had made alterations to the tank and had incorporated an opening. 
 
 “The stock was well hidden and it would be difficult to think the tanker was ferrying liquor without specific intelligence. From questioning the driver and cleaner of the vehicle, it has been established that they had set off from Haryana. They claim not to have details of the intended recipient of the stock. Further investigation has been handed over to Bagodara police,” said an official.
