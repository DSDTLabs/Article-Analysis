LUCKNOW: A   student picked a mistake in the LLB sixth semester question paper and even tweeted it on Monday. In the examination, students were asked to explain the meaning and importance of service tax under the service tax act. 

 In her tweet, law student   said, “Dear # Lucknow University, There is no separate act for service tax, it finds its enactment under the finance act 1994.” Another law student Neeraj Pandey said once a question paper is set, it is reviewed by the committee. Yet, a wrong question was asked in the examination. This shows how seriously the university takes the task of setting question paper, he said.
 
 “The dean ,law, RK Singh said that service tax act was a mistake that crept into the final copy of the question paper that was sent for printing,” said   spokesperson NK Pandey.
