CHANDIGARH: Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader and Hisar MP   has sought intervention of Union water resources minister   in securing Haryanaâ€™s share of water from Bhakra main line (BML)-Barwala link.

 In a communication to the minister, the Hisar MP has pointed out that as   has not got its share of water from the BML-Barwala link, farmers of Adampur and Nalwa constituency in Hisar had been put to extreme distress during a crucial phase of Rabi crops.
 
 Dushyant added that inadequate supply of water through the BML-Barwala link was further adding to woes of the people of Haryana. Constructed in 1969, it discharged only 1,250 cusecs (cubic metres per second) of water due to faulty design as against proposed 1,725 cusecs. The design was improved to discharge 1,400 cusecs for which lining and the banks were strengthened, first by Punjab and later Haryana. However, the deficiencies had continued till Punjab submitted a proposal for rectification of the BML-Barwala link in 2014.
 
 The MP also regretted the inability of Punjab to undertake work for removal of deficiencies due to an objection raised by the Rajasthan government in April 2015, resulting in the present impasse. He further pointed out that it was Haryana that was at the receiving end as far as getting its share from the river waters was concerned. He further appealed to the Union minister to resolve this issue between Rajasthan and Punjab so as to provide relief to the farmers of Haryana.
