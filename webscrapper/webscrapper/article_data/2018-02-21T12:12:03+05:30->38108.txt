NEW DELHI. Students appearing for class X exams arrived at examination centers in slippers after the Bihar School Examination Board ( ) barred them from entering exam halls with shoes and socks, reported ANI.

  
  
 As per photos shared by the news agency, few students, who were still wearing shoes and socks, were made to remove them in presence of guards before they were allowed entry.
 
 BSEB issued this advisory on Monday with the view to curb unfair practices in the exams and to save time spent in checking and invigilation.
 
 Appreciating the move, state education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said that this notification would ensure free and fair examination this year.
 
 “Thanks to tough measures adopted by the BSEB, the mentality of students has changed. They now know that only knowledge attained through hard work will ensure their success,” said Verma.
 
 However, the opposition criticized government for “harassing examinees”.
 
 “When I was the education minister, the board exams were conducted peacefully without use of unfair means. BSEB must stop burdening students with such advisories,” said former education minister Ashok Choudhary.
