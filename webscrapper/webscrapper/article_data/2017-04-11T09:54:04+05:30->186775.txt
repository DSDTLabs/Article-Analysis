DHARANSHALA: Continuing his tirade against chief minister Virbhadra Singh, former   has now accused the CM of being the “only hindrance” in bringing the Central University of Himachal Pradesh (CUHP) to Dehra. Rajour, brother of   MP Viplove Thakur, also charged Virbhadra with ignoring Dehra assembly constituency. In a Congress rally in Kangra recently, the ex-MLA had called the CM black sheep of the party.

 Talking to mediapersons on Monday, Rajour said that there were just four doctors against nine sanctioned posts in Dehra civil hospital. Other development works in the area had also come to a standstill. “The chief minister was the only hindrance in bringing CUHP campus to Dehra,” he said.
 
 “Huge chunk of land, about 80 acres, had already been transferred in the name of CUHP in Dehra. But the revenue officials have said that the CM has not given consent for this,” said Rajour, adding that he had requested Virbhadra to get the land demarcated but the CM refused to issue the orders.
 
 Rajour was   from Jaswan Pragpur from 2007 to 2012. He lost in the last assembly election to BJP’s Bikram Thakur.
 
 Now, he is eying Dehra constituency and hoping to get the party ticket. The rift between his family and the CM had been growing since after he was ignored during Virbhadra’s events in Dehra assembly constituency.
 
 In recent past, Viplove Thakur, also held rallies in Dehra after mistreatment of her brother. She too has been openly criticizing the CM for not allowing CUHP campus at Dehra.
