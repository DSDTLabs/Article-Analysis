GURUGRAM: The   government on Monday told the National Green Tribunal that no forest was cleared in Aravalis by any developer. The reply was submitted to   on a plea filed by environmental activist Col. Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi, who alleged the state government illegally granted permission to a realty firm to fell trees in Faridabad. He also alleged the realtor had not obtained forest clearance under provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, before felling the trees.

 Justifying the permission given to fell 6,000 trees in the area, the state government stated the area was not protected under any Act. “The area has not been classified as ‘forest’, or PLPA and was not part of the Aravali plantation. I don’t understand on what grounds the petition was filed. Also, the permission was given to fell   in the area,” said a counsel for the Haryana government.
 
 The developer’s lawyers also gave same explanation. “The status of the land is “yet to be decided”. Besides this, there was no tree at the site. Those were only shrubs,” one of the lawyers of the developer said.
 
 Ecologists, on the other hand, claimed that kikar is not a shrub. “The height of plantation is a major distinction between a shrub and a tree. Kikar tree grows as tall as 15 feet and its trunk has a diameter of more than 20 inches,” said Vijay Dashmana, chief ecologist at I am  .
 
 Petitioner Col. Oberoi, however, said, “The Supreme Court has declared entire Aravalis protected. The status of the land can’t be considered in this case as massive environmental destruction has taken place.” 
 
 The state government had in June granted permission to a real estate company to fell as many as 6,000 trees to clear a 52-acre land.
