LUCKNOW: A joint delegation of the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association and All India Jamaitul Quresh Uttar Pradesh met   Siddharth Nath Singh here on Tuesday to find a solution to the impasse over the crackdown against illegal slaughterhouses and meat shops. Headed by Sirauddin Qureshi, national president of All India Jamaitul Quresh UP, the delegation urged the state government to go a little slow on their drive in wake of the existing circumstances. 

 The minister assured the delegation that the Yogi government was not prejudiced. "We are not working with any preconceived notions against any caste, class or religious group," he said. Singh told reporters that he would place the delegation's version before the CM and ensure that their genuine interests were safeguarded. P 5
