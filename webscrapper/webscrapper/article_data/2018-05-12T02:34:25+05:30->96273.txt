GHAZIABAD: A man killed his sister-in-law after a   over sharing of the ancestral house in which they lived with their respective families in Masuri on Friday.

 The victim has been identified as Reshma, while her two brothers-in-law, Javed and Sajid, and an unidentified person, have been booked as the main accused in the murder. According to police, Reshma’s husband Arif shared the ancestral house in Masuri’s Nahal village with three of his brothers – Javed, Sajid and Abid.
 
 SHO, Masuri, Aparna Gautam said: “There was disagreement among brothers for a long time about who would build on the common portion of the house. In the past, arguments and fights had broken out several times among them, but later a compromised was reached. 
 
 A quarrel once again broke out on Thursday around 11.30 pm and the four brothers were arguing with each other over the issue. Reshma, who was present there, expressed her view on the sharing of the common portion. However, this enraged Javed and he attacked Reshma with a   lying nearby. He hit her on her head several times. He subsequently fled from the spot.
 
 The victim, who was bleeding profusely, was taken to a nearby hospital but was declared brought dead.
 
 Following a complaint by Reshma’s father Zahir Ahmed, an FIR has been registered against Javed and two others for the murder. While Javed is in police custody, other two are yet to be arrested. Reshma is survived by three children—two daughters and a son—and husband Arif who works at a furniture shop in Delhi.
