 ASI   of CIA ( ) staff (Khanna), along with other police personnel, went on patrolling duty to Bardhala village in Dhilwan, but just 200 yards short of a checkpost at Link Road in Manki village, he saw the white-coloured Swift car coming from Manki side. The team stopped the vehicle on suspicion, and the driver disclosed his name as Vijay Kumar, and the person sitting next to him was Gurpal Singh.
 
 During checking, five plastic bags were found on the car’s rear seat, and two plastic bags were lying in the car’s boot. The police team found seven bags of poppy husk, weighing 40kg each (total 280kg), after which they were arrested. The accused persons were booked under Section 15 of the NDPS Act, and the police presented a challan against them in the court.
 
 During the trial, the accused persons claimed innocence. However, prosecution pleaded for punishment to the accused persons on the basis of prosecution witnesses and chemical report of the consignment. The court, after taking the evidence on record, convicted the accused. The convicts prayed for leniency on the ground that they were first offenders and not previous convicts. They added that they were the sole bread-winners of their families.
