Vadodara: The leopard that had been visiting the residence of former Godhra MLA C K Raulji since Tuesday was caged on Friday. A trap was laid to nab him after he killed some hens near the farm and ate them.

 The leopard is a sub-adult and forest officials believe that it may not be an expert at hunting. The big cat had tried to kill a stray dog, but was unsuccessful and could only injure the dog.
 
 It is believed that the dog came to Rauljiâ€™s residence near Godhra from the jungles of Achhala and Chharia that are a few kilometres away. 
 
 The leopard used to sit on a compound wall of the compound of the home. This may be because it did not want to be pestered by mosquitoes or other insects.
