JAIPUR: Within days of   Survekshan 2018 ranking, sanitation woes are back to haunt the city.

 The garbage collection vehicles are becoming irregular and not visiting several areas in the city, forcing people to dump garbage on road sides. Moreover, residents are facing inconvenience as staff appointed by the private firm are not collecting garbage from the houses in the designated wards.
 
 “These hooper drivers who are coming are doing mere formality. They do not stop at houses to collect garbage. Also, timing of garbage collection is unscheduled. Most of the time, they come after 12 am when people have gone for work,” said  , a resident of Tilak Nagar.
 
 In the absence of proper garbage collection, heaps of garbage is piling up on the road sides as it remains unattended for days. The   has decided to remove depots from the colonies to inculcate habit among residents of throwing garbage in the collection vehicles.
 
 Now, after the depots are removed and garbage collection vehicles are not coming on time, residents have started throwing garbage on roads.
 
 Shalu Jain, another resident of the city, said, “Earlier, there was a depot in front of my house. It was removed by the JMC. Now, people are throwing garbage and it is spilling all over the road. JMC vehicles are not coming to collect the garbage.”
 
 The situation remains the same, where depots are placed at their location.  , a resident of   area, said, “The depots are flooded with garbage as the JMC has stopped lifting the trash after giving responsibility to the firm. Neither, firm nor JMC is collecting garbage. JMC will charge for this facility, however, it has failed to provide relief.”
 
 A senior official at JMC said, “We have put our best efforts to make the city  . There is a possibility that there was a mismanagement from firm’s end due to festival season. From Monday, sanitation conditions would be up to the standard.”
