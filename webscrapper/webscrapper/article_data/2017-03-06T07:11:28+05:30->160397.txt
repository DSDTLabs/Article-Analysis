 Dr Chandrasekar, the honorary president of the  , was in Kochi to attend Kerala chapter's annual conference. “With the knowledge and data accumulating within the medical community, doctors must start orienting their conference mo re on informing the public,“ he said.
 
 Amid increasing incidents of colorectal cancer in Kerala and other South Western regions in India, Dr Chandrasekar said that this can be controlled to a great extent if people make appropriate lifestyle changes.
 
 “We are imitating the West when it comes to our lifestyle. In the past, our food mainly comprised millets, fruits and vegetables which is now being replaced with oily and greasy food items,“ he said.
 
 Among gastrointestinal cancer, the most common kind of cancer in Kerala is colorectal cancer, which is also common in the West.
 
 He said, “Now, the cancer demographics are similar to the West.“
 
 In Chennai, where Dr Chandrasekar works as the chief gastroenterologist in  , he organized hepatitis-B vaccination camps last year, where over 1 lakh people were vaccinated following which he organized a question-andanswer session with the people who visited the camp.
 
 He said, “The Q&A round was a wonderful experience, where people got answers to their doubts and misconceptions directly with a medical professional.“
 
 He said that many women suffer from Helicobacter pylori infection; such bacterial complications can be avoided if people are made aware of the symptoms and can be treated correctly before it becomes complicated.
 
 “One of the things I am focusing is to inform the doctors to indulge in more public related activities. I think a direct approach will be more effective than reaching out to people indirectly via speaking to 200 doctors,“ he said.
