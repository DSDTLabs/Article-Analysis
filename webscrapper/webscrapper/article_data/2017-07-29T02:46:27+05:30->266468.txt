NEW DELHI: Several broadband connections of state-run   have been impacted in the capital after a   attack. The issue, which company officials claimed was “under control now”, impacted   at many households. The impact on enterprise connections was still not clear, though sources said operations there were also impacted.

 A top official at MTNL said the matter came to the company’s notice on Thursday. “We are confident that the issue will be rectified soon,” the official, who requested anonymity, said. The financially strapped telco said it was adopting a variety of measures to tackle the problem. “The modem has to be reconfigured to manage the problem.”
 
 The company has provided an immediate “on-phone rectification” helpline. “We are also contacting subscribers on our own. Apart from this, we are replacing modems where there is a serious issue due to the malware.”
 
 MTNL is advising its customers to follow certain steps to reboot the modem. “There is a reset button on every modem that needs to be pressed for a few seconds. This is equal to taking the system on to the factory settings mode.”
 
 The telco has not been able to detect the origin of the malware attack. Asked whether the company was coordinating with the IT ministry on the matter, the official said he was not aware of any such exercise.
