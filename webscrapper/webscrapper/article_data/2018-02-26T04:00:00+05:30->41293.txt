Ahmedabad: Historian Rizwan Kadri’s book ‘Aa Hatu Amdavad’ (This was Ahmedabad) was launched at historic Teen Darwaza by mayor Gautam Shah and other dignitaries on Sunday to mark the 607th birthday of Ahmedabad on February 26. The book uses Ahmedabad’s images captured by Colonel Thomas H Biggs for the book ‘Architecture at Ahmedabad, the capital of Goozerat’ published in 1855. Kadri says the book aims to examine the condition of monuments and push for conservation. The book features 35 city monuments.
