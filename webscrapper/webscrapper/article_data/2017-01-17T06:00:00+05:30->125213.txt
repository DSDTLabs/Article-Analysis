Visakhapatnam: Maoists of the Andhra-Odisha Border special zonal committee (SZC) have warned three persons with dire consequences if they did not stop posing as Naxal representatives and giving permissions to contractors to mine in the agency areas. 

 A press note of CPI Maoists released by AOB SZC official spokesman Jagabandhu on January 14 named Andhra University professor Jarra Appa Rao, former naxalite Pilli Venkateswarlu alias Satyam alias Jambri and TDP leader SV Ramana as persons threatening the local tribals and claiming that CPI Maoists had permitted contractors to mine. Many non-tribal contractors from the plains had set up crusher machines to extract laterite, granite and other reserves, the note said. 
 
 Jagabandhu alleged that it was Appa Rao who has been earning lakhs from contractors by allowing them to mine for for laterite at Chaparatipalem in GK Veedhi mandal. “Appa Rao has been claiming that he has relations with the Maoists. This is not true. On the contrary, he is getting benefits from political leaders and contractors,” said Jagabandhu.
 
 According to Maoists, Appa Rao is also maintaining relations with AP Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) cops and pressuring revolutionary activists and their family members to surrender. He has actively released posters against Maoists under the name of Adivasi Sangham under the direction of AP SIB, the note said. 
 
 Referring to surrendered naxal Pilli Venkateswarlu, Maoists dubbed him as an SIB agent. On TDP leader SV Ramana, who hails from G Madugula mandal in Visakha agency, the Maoists denied the former’s claim that he was a Naxal symphathiser and, instead, charged him of earning lakhs of rupees through illegal means. “We urge the tribal people not to believe these three people or maintain any relation with them,” Jagabandhu said.
