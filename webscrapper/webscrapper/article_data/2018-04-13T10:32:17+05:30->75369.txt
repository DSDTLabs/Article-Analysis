Announcing that the film chamber would consider afresh actress Sri Reddy’s application for membership, Movie Artistes’ Association (MAA) said they had been upset over the actress’ protest. “That is why the committee decided she would not be given membership. But some ‘elders’ suggested we should consider her application so that the issue can be resolved,” MAA president Sivaji   said.

 Sri Reddy’s application would now be put before the general body of the Movie Artistes’ Association for consideration.
 
 On April 8, Sivaji Raja had firmly announced that 900 artistes from the film industry would not act in any film with her following her semi-nude protest in front of the film chamber. However on Thursday, he said: “Sri Reddy, you are welcome into the film industry and all artistes will cooperate and act with you.”
 
 On April 7, the aspiring actress had resorted to a strip-protest in front of the film chamber premises at Filmnagar, alleging sexual harassment in the film industry. She also said she was deliberately being denied membership in MAA.
 
 Film producer   said anyone could approach the committee against sexual harassment, which would be constituted in the film chamber, irrespective of whether they were members in any association or not.
 
 Film director N Shankar, producer   and actor Naresh were also present at the press conference.
