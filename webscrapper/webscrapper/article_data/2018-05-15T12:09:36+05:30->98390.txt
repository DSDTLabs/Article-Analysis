COIMBATORE: Bharathiar University has sought approval from the   ( ) to offer distance learning programmes.

 The UGC had in March called for online applications from eligible higher educational institutions for offering open and distance learning courses for the academic year beginning July 2018.
 
 Though the university had applied last year, it was not accorded approval. 
 
 “When we applied last year, it was not processed online. Several other colleges had faced the same issue. So, we applied for offering open and distance learning courses this year and it has been accepted online,” said registrar incharge of the university, B Vanitha.
 
 In another communication, the UGC said the degrees acquired through distance learning were on a par with those acquired through a formal course. But it said institutions cannot run distance learning courses in fields such as engineering, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, architecture and physiotherapy.
 
 “We will convene a meeting and decide on the courses that can be offered through distance learning,” the registrar said.
