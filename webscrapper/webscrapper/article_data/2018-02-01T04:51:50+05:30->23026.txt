MUMBAI: Bombay high court has come to the aid of a six-year-old girl caught in a matrimonial dispute between her parents. The child had to travel more than three hours to attend school in   after her mother moved to her parental home.

 Justice   ruled that the girl’s mother would be entitled to shift to a school in Matunga in the next academic year. The court said it found “complete absence of sensitivity” on the part of the family court judge in rejecting the woman’s plea for a change of school.
 
 The court was hearing a petition filed by the child’s mother seeking directions to the father to cooperate in enabling change of school.
 
 “It is not in dispute that the distance to be travelled between Matunga and Vile Parle for a child in the first standard is substantially long. The mother needs to accompany the child to travel such a long distance,” said the judge.
 
 The court pointed out that the return journey at 5.30 pm to Matunga could take more than two hours. “All these eventualities are not conducive and are not in the interest and welfare of the child,” the judge held.
 
 The couple has been staying separately since 2016 as the woman returned with the child to her parental home in Matunga. The child, who was admitted to a leading international school in Vile Parle in nursery, has continued her education there.
 
 Advocate  , counsel for the woman, said the mother and child had to travel three hours every day - one hour in the morning and over two hours back to Matunga.
 
 The father, who argued the matter in person, opposed the change saying it would disrupt the child’s education. He also offered to make an independent flat available, either in   or Khar, for the mother and daughter.
 
 The court, however, held the choice could not be foisted on the woman. The court held she was free to decline “any offer made by the husband against her willingness and her psychological needs, particularly in a situation of matrimonial discord and turmoil.”
