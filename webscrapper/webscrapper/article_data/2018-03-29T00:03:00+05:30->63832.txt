Pune: Vehicular movement on the new   as well as the Old Airport Road came almost to a standstill on Wednesday night, leaving several flyers reaching the city late in the night stranded on their way home or other destinations.

 Queues of vehicles as long as 1km were seen around 11pm, which is not a rush hour. There were no policemen to man the traffic on the New Airport Road, leading to Vimannagar, Kalyaninagar and Vadgaon Sheri. Reason: Most of the city traffic police officers and policemen had gone back home after concluding the rehearsal for Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu’s visit to Pune on Thursday.
 
 A senior traffic police officer said the policemen had just gone to their residences after the daylong rehearsal. “Another thing contributing to the jam was a digging work of road surface by some private contractor. This has slowed down the vehicular movement on the road,” he said.
 
 Two policemen were sent to the spot after TOI contacted the senior police officers. The control room was not aware about the jam.
