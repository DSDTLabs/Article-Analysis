NOIDA: There will be no   in   in   this year. Last year, the circle rates were increased by nearly 14% but flats were kept out of the purview of the hike. The decision not to hike the circle rates will be a slight relief to the   reeling under post-demonetisation. 

 While the administration claimed to have anticipated the increase in revenue, post the announcement of the Jewar airport, it was clear from the data for registries in April-June quarter, that less number of properties have registered this year.
 
 According to officials, while 36,090 registries were done in April-June in 2016, the number of registries during the same quarter in 2017 is 27,073, which is 9,017 less.
 
 The notification for the rates will be out on July 31 and the circle rates will come into force from August 1. The circle rates will be applicable for all kinds of commercial and non-commercial categories.
 
 The rates are decided by a committee comprising five sub registrars (three for   and one each for Sadar, Dadri and Jewar tehsils) and the two assistant inspectors general (registration) of the district, following which they are implemented after an approval from the DM. 
 
 Nine objections were received by the committee from investors and builders who wanted the circle rates to be reduced due to slow down in the market. 
 
 “Following the last meeting on July 27, we decided that the circle rates will remain as present across the board. Because our interest is in increasing the revenue, we decided that there should be hike in the same-purchase of property and it will happen if we incentivise the process,” district magistrate BN Singh said while addressing mediapersons.
