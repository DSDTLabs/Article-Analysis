A Punjabi origin model has become the first Punjabi Canadian to be featured on the cover of Canada's beauty magazine 'Glow'.

 With only a few months into modelling, a 20 something   is already a sensation in the fashion world. Bali's face will be splashed on the cover of the April issue of the beauty magazine, and her story in its pages.
 
 Bali Kaur, who is also human rights activist and globetrotter, represents the modelling agency Sutherland Models. She has already been the face of big names including Joe Fresh, Sears and Toronto Tourism. Bali was born and raised in Canada but her parents trace their origins to Kalewal village in   district of Punjab.
 
 “It means so much to me to be part of the special diversity issue of the magazine. It tells the stories of women with different backgrounds.With the current political climate, it is important that we unite and celebrate our differences“, says Bali in an email to TOI.
 
 “I always dreamt of being a model, but thought it would not be possible. However, on seeing a greater representation of Indian models, I convinced my conservative Punjabi parents to let me try it out. Now, I am in the fashion industry and hope it will open the doors for many others .“
 
 She feels that a model's presence at big-ticket events is vital. “When you see your self in the big league, it sends out a message that one day you too can do it. I once thought I wouldn't be able to model, but seeing models like   and Pooja Morr on international runways and magazines, made my dreams seemed attainable,“she says.
 
 Congratulatory messages poured on Twitter and her Instagram page on her big moment. Toronto-based Punjabi writer and poet Rupi Kaur wrote, “full of joy seeing my sister on the cover, a Punjabi woman's face. You have blessed my 2017“. Toronto resident   said, “Bali has made Punjabi girls proud by her achievement and could inspire more girls for a career in beauty world“.
