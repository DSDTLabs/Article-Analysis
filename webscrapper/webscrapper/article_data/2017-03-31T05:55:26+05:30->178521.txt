KOLHAPUR: The second round of   (RTE)   process started across the district from Thursday and will conclude on April 8.

 According to the education department officials, eligibility of over 200 students was found to be invalid, resulting in merely 58 students getting qualified for the second round of the admission process.
 
 Subhash Chougule, education officer (primary), said that in the first round out of 1,159 students only 524 admissions were confirmed. As many as 210 applications were deemed ineligible as the documents submitted were not as per the requirement.
 
 “The second round of admission will remain functional till April 8. The department has sent SMSs to parents of the children who are eligible for admission. We would like to appeal to the parents, who are yet to receive the SMS or any kind of communication from us regarding admission, to go to the school they have applied for admission with original documents to finalise the process,” he said.
 
 According to Chougule, information of the selected students is also available on the RTE portal which can be accessed by the school authorities. “Once the current admission process closes then only the future planning regarding vacant seats will be taken in to consideration,” he said.
 
 “The education department, which is getting minimal response for RTE admissions as compared to the last year, is clueless about remedies through which they can increase the number. The department needs to find a solution,” said Sattappa Mohite, a city-based education activist.
 
 It should be noted that under the  , economically and socially disadvantaged children, as well as those with disabilities, can be admitted in Class I or at the pre-primary stage, of private unaided schools. These children receive free education including textbooks, and other facilities.
