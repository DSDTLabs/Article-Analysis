PATNA: Deputy CM   has said the state government has made several “small interventions” in the last one decade that transformed the life of people.

 “The International Growth Centre (IGC) and Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) should make a study of these interventions and their impact,”   said while giving the inaugural address at a function after the commissioning of IGC to conduct its second phase of activities in the state in association with ADRI.
 
 Such interventions, Modi said, included provision of school uniforms to girls and boys of government schools and cycles to girl students of Class IX. The latter led to increase in the enrolment of girl students in Class IX from around 1 lakh to 7 lakh, he said and added it also resulted in delayed marriage of girls which in turn brought down the state’s population-fertility ratio.
 
 Among other such interventions were 50% reservation to women on single posts in panchayat raj bodies, drive against child marriage and investment of Rs 54,000 on every girl child till her graduation, he said.
 
 Agriculture minister   said the IGC should conduct research activities and policy evaluations in the agriculture sector, while Bihar Public Service Commission chairman Shishir Sinha said new researches and insights were required to help in course correction with regard to the government’s policies.
 
 IGC executive director  , its programme director   and ADRI member-secretary Shaibal Gupta spoke on the theme ‘Building evidence, evaluation and capacity in Bihar’. Research works yield insights that help in policy formulation and effective implementation of government interventions, they said.
