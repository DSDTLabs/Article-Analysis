PUNE: The   on Wednesday arrested four persons, including the site engineer and safety supervisor of an   at Paud Phata, for causing the death of 50-year-old Anushree Pande.

  She fell from the ninth floor of the   on Tuesday evening.
 
 The incident happened around 3.30pm, when Pande had gone to see a   in the building.
 
 The arrested persons include site engineer Harshal Mehtre, safety supervisor Rupesh Keskar, site supervisor Shirish Gujrathi and purchase manager Sandeep Patil.
 
 Pande had gone to the housing scheme 45, Nirvana Hills around 3pm. Patil and Gujrathi had taken her to the ninth floor to show a four-bedroom sample flat. 
 
 After seeing the flat, Pande told the two that her daughters also wanted to see it and asked them to go down and fetch them. 
 
 Patil said he asked her to come down with them, but Pande told them that she would stay there and have a closer look at the flat. 
 
 As soon as Patil went down, he and his colleague heard a thud, and found Pande lying on the iron roof on the first floor. Pande died on the spot.
 
 Raghunath Phuge, senior inspector of the Kothrud police station, told TOI it was a clear case of negligence by the employees at the construction site. 
 
 “Investigations revealed that while taking her up to the ninth floor, the woman was not provided with safety gears like a helmet. Even the purchase engineer and his colleague did not wear helmets,” Phuge said.
 
 Phuge said that when Pande had told them to fetch her daughters, they should have taken her down along with them or should have deployed a person with her. “We have arrested four employees under Section 304 (A) (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code,” Phuge said, adding, “Our probe is on.”
