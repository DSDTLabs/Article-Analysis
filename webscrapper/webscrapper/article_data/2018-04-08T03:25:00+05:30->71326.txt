Vijayawada: The pathetic condition of the Madduru-Gosala Road is forcing motorists from  , Nagayalanka and other surrounding areas to commute an additional 10 km to reach Gannavaram  .

 An absolute overhaul of the road from Madduru to Gannavaram via Uppuluru would reduce the distance greatly for airport bound passengers. It may be recalled that the existing road was dug out to lay a new road two years ago, before Krishna Pushkaralu, but the work was left unfinished . The construction works of the new road connecting Avanigadda Road to Gosala were executed for about 5 km, leaving behind 1.4 km out of the stretch of 6.4 km, this was because of fund shortage.
 
 As the existing road was completely dug out to lay the new road, the 5 km relaid portion of the road was rendered useless. Even commuters from Vanukuru and Madduru are also suffering with unfinished roads. tnn
