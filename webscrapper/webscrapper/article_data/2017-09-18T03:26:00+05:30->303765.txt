Panaji: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Sunday assured the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) of using the 1.71 lakh sqm land at Bainguinim to set up only a garbage treatment plant. He said if the CCP tried to build the plant on its own, then it would have to sell the civic body itself.  Speaking at an event on Swachh Bharat-Nitol Goem at Mala, Parrikar said the Bainguinim land was acquired by the state government and handed over to the CCP early 2009 for setting up the plant. However, no work has been done yet. Last week, despite insisting on a tripartite agreement, the civic body resolved to hand over the land to the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC). City mayor Surendra Furtado was present at the function. Parrikar said. “As the mayor is present, I want to say one more thing that the entire piece of land at Bainguinim has been bought by government. It was given to the CCP to set up the garbage treatment plant. If they now want to go to set up the plant, they would have to sell the civic body as the project will cost in crores.” He added that some people might be of the opinion that it is a prime area, but the fact is about 30,000 sqm of land cannot be used due to overhead high-tension lines and an underground pipeline. “It will take about two years to complete the Bainguinim plant. The mayor need not have any worries as the land would be used solely for the purpose of constructing a garbage treatment plant,” Parrikar said. Over the last week, 17 CCP councillors, who swear allegiance to Goa Forward Party (GFP) leader Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate, refused to hand over the acquired land to GWMC. Monserrate, along with the councillors, had approached GFP president and town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai and had even sought legal opinion to verify if the land could be leased to GWMC.
