LUDHIANA: A local court, on Friday, sentenced a drug peddler to seven years of rigorous imprisonment.

 A fine of Rs1 lakh was also imposed on the convict. In case of default in fine payment, Rajiv Kumar   will undergo another two years of rigorous imprisonment.
 
 Samrala police, on November 2, 2007, had booked Sukha, 40, a resident of  , under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act after 24.50 kilograms of ephedrine powder was found in his possession.
 
 As per prosecution, a police team had set up a check-post on  , near Ghulal village, on a tip-off. A car coming from Ludhiana side was signalled to stop. After 24.50 kilograms of ephedrine powder was found wrapped in polythene bags in the car, its driver Sukha was arrested. 
 
 During trial, Sukha said he was framed, but could not produce any evidence in his defence.
 
 The additional public prosecutor for the state sought punishment on the basis of prosecution witnesses and the recovered consignment’s chemical examination report.
 
 The court observed that a huge quantity of the consignment was recovered, so the possibility of planting the recovery did not appear probable. 
 
 The convict sought leniency, saying he was not a repeat offender and that he was the sole breadwinner of his family. 
 
 The court observed that the menace of drugs was playing havoc with the state youth. Therefore, “no mitigating circumstances exist in favour of the convict for taking a lenient view”.
