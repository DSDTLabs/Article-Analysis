NEW DELHI: Several private   in the city have set an upper   in   admissions though according to the directions of the department of education, older children can be admitted. However, a lack of clarity on the wording of the direction allows schools to circumvent it.

 According to the guidelines released on December 19, while private unaided schools are allowed to impose a lower age limit, they are also allowed to admit students above that limit. “For admission in pre-school, the department of education defined the minimum age as three years by March 31 of the year in which admission is sought and there is no bar to admit students above the minimum age fixed by the department,” reads the order. 
 
 However, lawyer-activist Khagesh Jha says: “The language of the order is so convoluted that schools can do anything they want. The fact is that the upper age limit has been banned by the high court, and the schools know about it.” 
 
 This flouting of rules has put parents in a dilemma. They are now struggling to find alternative schools where their child meets the criteria. A parent, who did not wish to be identified, told TOI that a prominent school has set an upper age limit inspite of the DoE guidelines. “My child crosses the upper age limit by 20 days. I had shortlisted some schools in my locality but now my options have shrunk even more,” she said. 
 
 Amit Yadav, another parent, said at least five schools in his area have imposed an upper age limit and that there is no explanation for it. “One of the schools had, in its online form, put an upper limit in the section related to the child’s date of birth . My child is older and hence I wasn’t able to fill that column. When I went to the school, the guard turned me away saying that the website had all the details and the school authorities won’t help,” he said. Yadav has filed a complaint with the DoE redressal cell. “But I don’t know when or if there will be any action,” he said.
