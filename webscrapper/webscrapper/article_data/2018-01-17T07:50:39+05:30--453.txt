AHMEDABAD: The   on Tuesday asked the   to pay Rs 5 lakh, as   for negligence by the   authorities, to the widow of   alias Battery, who was killed inside the prison in 2005.

 A division bench upheld the conclusion of a single-judge bench that Battery’s murder inside the jail was due to negligence by jail officials and that the state government was bound to pay his family compensation. The single-judge bench had ordered the government to pay compensation on a petition filed by Battery’s widow, Hetal.
 
 Battery incarcerated in Sabarmati Central Jail in August 1995, in connection with a murder case. He was killed in August 2005, and the murder was considered the result of a gang war within the prison.
 
 The state government was not ready to accept that there was negligence by jail officials and challenged the order for compensation. The division bench rejected the state government’s arguments and said that the jail superintendent and his officers were negligent in their duty. Jail officials were indicted in a departmental inquiry and two were even dismissed from service. In all, 12 persons were convicted for Battery’s murder and for bringing weapons into the prison. The government cannot thus claim that jail officials were not negligent.
 
 Moreover, the HC noted that it is the duty of the government to ensure the safety and security of prisoners. It cited a Supreme Court order which asked the state to pay compensation for a murder inside a prison for the government’s failure to perform its duty.
