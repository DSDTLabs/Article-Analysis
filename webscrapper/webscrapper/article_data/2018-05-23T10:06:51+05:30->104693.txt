ITANAGAR/KOHIMA: Lending support to the voices of dissent over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, hundreds of student activists staged demonstrations on Monday across three northeast states. 

  The apex bodies of students' unions in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland organised sit-ins on Monday morning in their respective state capitals, demanding immediate scrapping of the proposed legislation. The protesters also submitted memoranda to the governors in their states, seeking their intervention in the matter. 
 
 The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced in the Lok Sabha to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955. A key amendment in the bill seeks to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan after six years of their residence in India. 
 
  In  , members of the All Arunachal Pradesh Students' Union (AAPSU) said they would continue the stir till the time the government concedes to their demands.   president Hawa Bagang said the Centre had no regard for the indigenous people of the region. The Bangladeshi refugees, who have been residing illegally in our state, would be asked to leave, he said. 
 
 In Kohima, members of the Naga Students' Federation ( ) raised slogans against the central government for introducing the bill in the Lok Sabha. Echoing similar sentiments, the Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) on Monday urged the legislators of Mizoram to adopt a resolution to reject the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016.
 
 The MZP also organised a rally in the state capital to register their protest over the proposed bill. 
 
 If the bill was passed by Parliament, it would mean that the lawmakers do not consider Mizoram an integral part of the country, MZP president   said while addressing the rally.
 
 Agarwal, during a public hearing in   on May 10, said the views and recommendations would be compiled in a report and submitted to Parliament.
