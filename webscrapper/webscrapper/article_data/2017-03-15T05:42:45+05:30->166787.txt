NAGPUR: The Nagpur unit of   (IMA),   (VHA) and Maharashtra Association of Resident doctors (MARD) are up in arms against attack on a   of Dhule Civil Hospital.

 On Sunday night, resident doctor of Dhule Civil Hospital Dr Roshan Mhamunkar was beaten up by a patient’s relatives, who were angry over the alleged delay in treatment. Police have arrested nine people for beating up the doctor.
 
 Dr Mhamunkar suffered chest injuries, swollen eye, and severe injuries on skull and abdomen. 
 
 MARD members protested in front the chamber of dean of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) over the incident. They also submitted a letter to dean Dr Abhimanyu Niswade asking him to take the issue to the university and the ministry of health education to ensure safety of doctors in future.
 
 MARD has also demanded to revise the security system of GMCH and provide armed guards in sensitive places such as casualty and wards.
 
 In the meantime, IMA’s Nagpur chapter also organized a protest meeting on Tuesday. IMA president Dr Avinash Wase said, “IMA (Maharashtra) has decided to take out a silent march in Dhule on Wednesday. The government should ask for proper enquiry into the matter and take stringent action. It also needs to provide a conducive atmosphere to doctors rendering services in government hospitals and private nursing homes.”
 
 VHA secretary Dr Anup Marar said, “The government should consider adding stricter clauses as applicable in the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime (MOCA) Aact. Such assaults are discouraging private doctors from treating serious patients. Now, people are even attacking government hospital doctors.”
