KOHIMA: Nagaland governor   on Tuesday directed chief minister   to obtain vote of confidence on the floor of the assembly on or before July 15. 

  In a statement issued by the Raj Bhavan on Tuesday, the governor's PRO said the directive comes on the heels of the claim submitted by former CM TR Zeliang to form government stating that he commands the support of 34 MLAs of Naga People's Front (NPF) and seven Independents. 
 
 The Shurhozelie government has been reduced to a minority following a revolt by majority of ruling NPF legislators. Zeliang is now camping in New Delhi to meet central BJP leaders to convince them that he is the real leader of NPF. The rebel MLAs are camping at a resort in Assam's Kaziranga demanding a change in NPF leadership.
 
  On Tuesday, Shurhozelie filed his nomination for the July 29 bypoll to Northern Angami-I constituency. The last date of filing papers is Wednesday. Scrutiny will take place on July 13 and last date of withdrawal of nomination is July 15. 
 
  Shurhozelie had taken oath as chief minister on February 22 after Zeliang was forced to step down due to a public protest. Zeliang's move to conduct urban local body elections with 33% reservation for women had faced huge opposition from various Naga tribes. The protest turned violent and led to the killing of two protesters in police firing. This aggravated the law and order situation and Zeliang had to ultimately resign. As per the constitution, since Shurhozelie is not an elected member of the assembly, he should get himself elected to the state legislature within six months from the date of his appointment, failing which he would cease to be the chief minister.
