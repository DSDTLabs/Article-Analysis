Surat:  , who is a member of senate at Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU), filed an application under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to get information about the educational qualifications of vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta on Monday. 

 Rabari, who is a Congress councillor in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), had earlier demanded details in a question submitted during the senate meeting of the university. His demand was rejected at the senate meeting held on March 27. The university did not give any specific reason for rejection of the demand.
 
 “Only highly qualified and experienced persons are appointed as vice-chancellors. It is the right of every individual studying or working in the university to know the qualification of their vice-chancellor. We should also be allowed to see his mark sheets and degrees,” Rabari told TOI.
 
 The senator has sought copies of graduation, post-graduation and PhD mark sheets as well as degrees of the vice-chancellor. “There should be no problem in giving copies of these documents to me. Refusal to share copies of the documents shows that there is something wrong,” Rabari said.
 
 He has also asked in his RTI application what action has been taken by the university in an inquiry ordered by the governor’s office. Rabari had informed the governor’s office that many individuals were using the vice-chancellor’s chamber in his absence following which the university authorities were asked to look into it.
