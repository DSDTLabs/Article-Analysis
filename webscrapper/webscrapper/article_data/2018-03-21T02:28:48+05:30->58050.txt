NEW DELHI: Students of   on Monday night protested outside the hostel against the   meted against them. They even broke the old hostel block gate demanding improved facilities in the hostel. The   ended after the provost of the hostels arrived at the site, and after much discussion and deliberations, agreed to their demands.

 The students said, last week, one of the girls was not allowed to collect her food she ordered from outside after 8pm — the curfew for ordering food — which was the tipping point. “Our protest against the incident has made the   administration realise that student demands are genuine,” said Nasima Choudhury, third year undergraduate student.
 
 Safoora Zargar, a second year MA student, said, “The situation was ripe for us to protest for we have been discriminated against for long.” She added that it was often that the girls were treated badly by even the mess workers, who would refuse to serve food if they reached a little late, even threatening to complain to the parents.
 
 Of the various demands, improvement in the quality of food served in the hostel was the major one. “We have also asked that the hostel wardens, provost, principals and the VC be made accountable through amendments in rules wherever necessary. We also demanded that the deadlines and curfew rules be extended till 10.30pm and streetlights installed around the hostels,” Choudhury added.
 
 The students demanded that no action should be taken against those participating in the protest.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Jamia media coordinator Saima Saeed said, “We have agreed, in principle to several of their demands taking into account the benefit of all. Jamia believes in equality for all its students.”
 
 Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the students celebrated their ‘freedom’ after their demand for extension of curfew time was adhered to by the administration.
