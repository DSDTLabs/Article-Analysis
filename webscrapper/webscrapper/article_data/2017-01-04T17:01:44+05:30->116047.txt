BHOPAL: Members of   (AIBOA) and   (AIBEA) took to streets on Tuesday to press for compensation to the families of bank employees and customers who died while working or standing in queues after demonetisation. 

 Seeking bonus for sweating it out in the aftermath of demonetisation on November 8 last year, the agitating employees said a CBI inquiry should be initiated against those who have a large amount of money despite limited cash being released by the RBI. After staging a dharna at the Oriental Bank of Commerce, the bank employees resorted to sloganeering against the RBI and the central government. They sought resolution of their issues at the earliest. In Madhya Pradesh, eight deaths have been reported, of which one was a bank employee in Bhopal.
 
 The demands of these bank employees include proper and equal flow of cash to all the banks (nationalised and private), making all ATMs functional and transparency in flow of cash in banks. "All the employees sitting here are on pay loss and want RBI to pay the compensation. Those who could not join us for protest came here during lunch time," said VK Sharma, secretary of Madhya Pradesh Bank Officers Association.Their spokesperson Guna Shekharan said, "A memorandum has also been submitted to the RBI regional director to apprise him about the conditions under which we are working." 
 
 The bankers claimed that RBI and other authorities have been changing their statements now and then, which is also leading to problems for them.
