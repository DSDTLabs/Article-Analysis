Kolhapur: The civic body has organised a seven-day camp starting from January 29 to facilitate commercial establishments to renew their annual shop licence and obtain new ones for the upcoming projects.

 The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) issues licences to all the commercial establishments and trading units except the hotels and bakeries which fall under the jurisdisction of Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The commercial establishments—hospitals, retail shops, malls, trading units— which operate without a licence or fail to renew their licence are considered illegal. Such establishments are sealed by the KMC as activities taking place in such establishments are considered illegal.
 
 Civic chief Abhijeet Chaudhari issued a public notice on Sunday asking owners or the operators of the establishment to get their licence renewed during the seven day camp. "Many operators have not applied for renewal. Many have applied but the applications are yet to be scrutinised by various departments such as health, fire, estate and town planning. Officials of all the departments will be attending the camp. They will scrutinise and clear the applications on the spot. Stern action will be taken against the operators who fail to attend the camp. We might even seal their properties. We are going to initiate a drive against such commercial establishments from the first week of next month," said an official of the licence department on the condition of anonymity. 
 
 At present, around 12,000 commercial establishments are registered with the civic body. KMC authorities claim that over 4,000 units have not renewed their licence. The establishments of over 230 units are required to register with the licence department. Recently, the KMC took a decision to offer a concession to the owners if they pay five years’ licence fees in advance. 
 
 The licence renewal camp will take place at the KMC main building during the office hours from January 29 to February 4.
