Vadodara: Four months after a Bharuch-based businessman Milin Shah was robbed by some persons including one posing as a fake cop, the police have arrested one more accused in connection with the case. 

 Rahul Kahaar, a resident of Panigate, was nabbed by the detection of crime branch (DCB) on Sunday near his home. Crime branch sleuths said that he was on the run after a case of loot worth Rs 2.25 crore was registered by Milin’s friend Rakesh Shah in November last year. 
 
 Police have already arrested three prime accused including Vishal alias Vicky Kahaar, Umang Kahaar and Smit Kahar in the case. “We have also recovered Rs 53.39 lakh of the booty during investigations. Two of the other accused Kiran Chauhan and Vijay Bariya had applied for anticipatory bail in the court but it has been rejected,” police said. 
 
 In November last year, Milin had come to the city to exchange the invalid Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes after demonetization. Vicky had promised that he would help Shah convert his cash into white money. 
 
 Milin had said in his complaint to the Bapod police that he was kidnapped by Vicky and other accused who took him to Waghodia . Milin had told the police that Chauhan introduced himself as crime branch sleuth and threatened him. He had stated that Kahar and Chauhan sat in his car and then took him to Waghodia. 
 
 There were six other persons including a woman in other cars who accompanied Kahar and Chauhan. Kahar and Chauhan then allegedly threatened Shah and his accountant revolver and fled with Rs 2.15 crore cash.
