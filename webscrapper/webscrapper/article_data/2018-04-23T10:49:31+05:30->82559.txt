MUMBAI: Many parts of the country have been facing   for the past few weeks, with ATMs running out of money. Mumbai Mirror spoke to   ( ) Chairman   on the cash supply situation. He indicated that the number of Rs 2,000 notes that must come back to banks are not coming in enough numbers. He also claimed that the cash crunch is over. Excerpts from the brief interview:
 
  
 
  
  There are multiple causes. Not just one. There is increased demand. The circulation of Rs 2,000 notes is less. The supply of Rs 500 notes needs to be augmented. ATMs are being recalibrated. In Madhya Pradesh, there was more payment to farmers due to procurement.
  
  
 
  
  There is no cash crunch now. The availability of cash in ATMs is 86 per cent now, and in geographies that had problem, the availability of cash is 83 per cent whether it’s Bihar or some other state. There is no cash crunch now. It is all over.
  
  
 
  
  It was mostly in Bihar, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. These are the states that had a problem, but in all these places, the availability of cash in ATMs is 83 per cent now.
  
  
 
  
  It is a regular process. They have indented.
  
  
 
  
  Wherever cash is needed, currency chests have placed orders.
  
  
 
  
  They depend fully on us. Demand is normal now.
  
  
 
  
  I don’t know.   banks mein vapas aana chahiye, utna to nahi aa raha hai.   kar rahe hain pata nahi. I can’t say whether the currency is in circulation in the market or people are hoarding. But it’s a fact that the Rs 2000 notes are not coming back to banks in enough numbers.
  
  
 
  
  I have not checked on this.
