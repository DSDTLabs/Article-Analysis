Vadodara: A farmer of Sejakuva village in Padra taluka was killed allegedly by his son for scolding him and asking him to find a job late Tuesday night.

 Police said that the deceased identified as Bhagwan Tadapada (48) used to often scold his son Ghanshyam alias Kanti Tadpada for borrowing money from him and not finding a job. “On Tuesday night when the father-son duo were alone at home, Ghanshyam must have demanded money from his father. But like every time Bhagwan must have scolded him which may have led to a heated argument between them,” said a police official.
 
 The neighbours told the police that both Bhagwan and Ghanshyam came out of the house while arguing. Both were abusing each other in the front yard of the house and after few minutes Ghanshyam hit Bhagwan with an axe on his head, the police said. Cops said that Bhagwan fell down immediately after which Ghanshyam hit his father multiple times with the axe killing him on the spot.
 
 After committing the offence, Ghanshyam fled from the spot, but while passing from the neighbourhood he kept shouting that he has killed his father, the police said. “We have taken statements of some villagers, who saw Ghanshyam killing his father and then leaving from the village,” the police official said.
