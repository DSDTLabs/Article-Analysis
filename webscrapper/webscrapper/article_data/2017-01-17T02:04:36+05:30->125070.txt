Ghaziabad: In a dramatic turnaround, the   on Monday expelled its sitting MLA and candidate for the   assembly seat,  , on charges of anti-party activities. The action came just a few days after party supremo Mayawati renominated him from the seat in a list released on January 5. The expulsion has shocked many as the filing of nominations is set to begin for the first phase of polls in the state on Tuesday.

 District president of BSP Prem Chand Bharti told TOI that Sharma’s expulsion orders were issued by the top leadership of the party on charges of indiscipline and anti-party activities. 
 
 “The expulsion letter was issued in   as per the instructions of national general secretary Naseem-ud-din Siddiqui. Sharma has neither been coordinating with party workers nor with members of the general public in Sahibabad. He has not been devoting adequate time to his constituency as a result of which voters have vented anger against him. He has not been helping in organising public meetings or cadre meetings of the party in the district,” Bharti told TOI.
 
 According to sources, Sharma has been expelled after a section of party workers complained to the BSP brass saying that he had not participated in the birthday celebrations of their leader Mayawati, which were held in different parts of the district on Sunday.
 
 Sharma was elected as an MLA for the first time in 2012. 
 
 In the assembly elections of 2007, Sharma had unsuccessfully contested as an independent candidate from the Ghaziabad seat. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, BSP had fielded him against Rajnath Singh in the Ghaziabad seat which he lost.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sharma said he would contest the election as an independent candidate. “The allegations levelled against me are completely baseless. I had participated in the birthday celebrations of our supremo on Sunday. It is a conspiracy against me to eliminate me from the party at the last moment. I will contest as an independent,” Sharma said.
