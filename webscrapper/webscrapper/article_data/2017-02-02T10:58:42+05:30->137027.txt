VIJAYAWADA: Farmers' unions and experts in the field of agriculture gave a thumbs down to the budgetary allocations made to the farming sector in the Wednesday's Union budget. They said the allocations would hardly result in double income to farmers, as claimed by finance minister   .

 Even though the target agricultural credit was fixed at `10 lakh crore, vice-president of   Ravula   said that most of the credit would not reach farmers. Former member of ICAR MVS   said the Centre had done precious little to increase minimum support price (MSP).
