BENGALURU: A 30-year-old employee of the Akash Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Devanahalli, has filed a   complaint against its founder chairman  , his wife   and  , a staffer.

 In her complaint on March 12, the woman said the accused, particularly Muniraju, started sexually harassing her when she refused to bring fake patients whenever senior medical officers of the   came to the hospital on inspection.
 
 
 “I have been working in the institute since April 1, 2014 and was forced to bring fake patients on many occasions. I came to know that it was an illegal activity and decided to stop bringing fake ones. But the accused trio started abusing and threatening me with dire consequences and finally went on to sexually harass me for refusing their directives,” she said.
 
 As the complainant did not comply with their demands, Muniraju allegedly stopped paying her. “They stopped my payment since I stopped bringing fake patients. They owe me Rs 6 lakh as outstanding salary,” the complainant said.
 
 Police said they have not arrested any of the accused. “We have to question them first,” Devanahalli cops said.
 
 When contacted, the complainant’s family members told   that Veena had threatened “to throw acid on her face” for not heeding Muniraju’s words. “We have documents to prove how the woman was forced to work under threatening conditions. When she refused to listen to the director, Veena threatened her with dire consquences, including an acid attack,” a senior citizen from the woman’s family said.
