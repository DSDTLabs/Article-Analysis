KOZHIKODE: A   has refused to join a teacher training institute under   at Edavanna in Malappuram after the institution insisted that she could not wear purdah on all days while attending the class.

 Husna C, wife of Muhammad Harshad P, decided not to pursue the course after institute authorities rejected her plea to wear purdah instead of sari. Jamia Nadwiya is run by   (KNM), a Salafi organisation. "There is a stipulation in the institute that students should wear sari three days a week. My wife does not even wear churidar," said Muhammad Harshad, husband of the girl.
 
 "So, we decided that purdah would be more comfortable and safe than sari. When we contacted the principal he said he also would support our decision, but added that he was helpless in the case," Harshad said. He approached the state leadership of the KNM to get permission to wear the 'Islamic dress'.
 
 But the authorities at Jamia Nadwiyya insisted on the dress code in the institution. "It cannot be relaxed for one individual. We have pre-school to BEd colleges under the trust and each institution has a particular uniform," said assistant registrar of Jamia Nadwiyya, Adil Atheef.
 
 "We told the girl that if she is so particular in wearing purdah, she can join the Arabic College where the uniform is purdah," said Adil.
 
 In a letter to KNM general secretary  , Harshad said other institutions such as Farook College, Mambad MES (autonomous college) and Sullamussallam College, Areacode, allow students to wear purdah.
 
 "I don't understand what happened to our movement (KNM) to deny an opportunity to my wife to study by wearing purdah at an institution directly controlled by KNM." he added. Harshad said he had gone to the KNM office to get a response. "The staff said KNM could not do anything in the issue as the institution was run by a trust. So my wife decided to drop the idea of pursing the teacher education course at the institute and joined for a degree course," he said.
