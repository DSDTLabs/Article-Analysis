GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat assembly’s   (SC)   has criticized the government for not providing sufficient   in scheduled caste dominated areas in villages. The committee also raised concern over the lack of proper representation of SC community in government jobs and suggested the government should implement scheduled caste reservation in jobs in self-financed colleges.

 The committee, headed by BJP MLA Bhanuben Babariya, raised concerns over diversion of grants meant for scheduled castes and asked government to ensure proper implementation of SC schemes. 
 
 In its report, the committee noted, “As per the survey by the social justice & empowerment department and the filed visits it was found that drinking water facilities for scheduled castes was not proper in the villages. In many villages, water facilities were provided only after the committee’s suggestions.’’
 
 While appraising the labour & employment, civil supply, consumers affairs department’s schemes, the committee noted, “It needs to be ensured that grants allocated for SC community schemes are used for them only. The expenditure made on general schemes and SC schemes must be separately accounted for.” 
 
 The committee also proposed to link “Ma Amrutam’’, Shramik Sahay Scheme’’ and “U-Win’’ schemes for the maximum benefit of the SC community. Funds for food supply of the SC community needs to be strengthened, it said. 
 
 “It needs to be ensured that 7% of the total funds are used for scheduled caste welfare only,’’ the committee noted. While appraising the state education department’s welfare activities for schedule castes, the committee after scrutiny of the Gujarat University’s activities, observed, “Self-financed colleges are not following reservation criteria in employing staff.’’
