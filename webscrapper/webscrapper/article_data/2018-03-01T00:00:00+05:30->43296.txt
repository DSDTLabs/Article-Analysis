 actor   has suffered a neck and back   while filming a stunt sequence on Tuesday for his upcoming movie Randhawa. In the film, which is directed by  , the actor plays the role of an ornithologist, as well as a royal from the 19th century in a throwback sequence.
Speaking about the incident, director Sunil says, “We finished shooting 90% of the film about two weeks ago and were reviewing the footage, when   saw a particular stunt sequence and wasn’t happy with the way it had come out because the ropes we used for safety did not make the scene look authentic. Being the committed actor that he is, he wanted to re-shoot that portion, but this time without a rope or stunt double. So, we went to  , where the climax and that particular stunt sequence was shot, and re-did the scene. In it, Bhuvann had to sprint and come to a sliding stop. Unfortunately, he tripped and landed hard on his back, causing serious injury to his lower back and neck. The strange thing was that while his nose did not take any impact directly, it started to bleed profusely, so we immediately took him to the hospital. He was transferred to a Bengaluru hospital yesterday and has been advised rest for over a months.”
 While the film’s CG and post-production is almost done, all that was left was to shoot the 19th century portion early next week, for which sets were erected in KR Puram and Nelamangala. But because of the  , it will be pushed to a later date. “It’s too early to discuss with Bhuvann about when the remaining scenes can be shot. Our priority now is for him to rest and recover. While doctors have said he needs to rest for over a month, knowing Bhuvann’s resolve and commitment to the film, I’m confident he will recover soon and shoot the scenes much before that,” says Sunil.
 The team plans to release the film’s trailer on March 18 and the movie is expected to release by April.
