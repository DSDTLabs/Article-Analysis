HOWRAH: A   Monday night after her estranged boyfriend   on   following which, her   fell through.

 The accused youth was arrested on Tuesday morning after irate neighbours ransacked his house at Amta in Howrah.
 
 In the complaint lodged by the victim’s elder sister, Kabita Chandra, the girl, a resident of Jirat at Jagatballavpur in Howrah, had an affair with the accused youth, Abhijit Dhali, a third-year student. “The girl would visit her sister at her in-laws’ house at Amta, where she developed intimacy with Dhali who lived in the locality,” the police said. A fortnight earlier, the girl called off the relationship as her marriage was fixed. Dhali then allegedly threatened to harm her to such extent that she would never be able to marry, the complaint stated.
 
 Shortly, the girl reportedly found that her nude photographs and some pictures of her in compromising positions had been uploaded on Facebook. As a result, her marriage negotiation broke down. “On Monday night, she entered her room and locked it from inside. When she didn’t come out of the room till late on Tuesday morning, we broke open the door to find her hanging from the ceiling,” one of her relatives said.
 
 Angry neighbours then converged on Dhali’s house and ransacked it, demanding his punishment. The police intervened and took him in custody. “Dhali has been arrested and charged with abetment to suicide. Several sections of the cyber crime law have also been slapped on him,” said additional SP (Howrah) Biswa Chand Thakur.
