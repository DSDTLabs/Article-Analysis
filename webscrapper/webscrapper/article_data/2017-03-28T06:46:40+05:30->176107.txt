CHENNAI: For the first time, government officials accompanied disability rights groups to assess accessibility at polling booths ahead of the  . In a two-day exercise that started on Monday, volunteers, activists and local   officials are mapping facilities at all the 256 booths in the constituency to ensure they are disabled-friendly on April 12, the polling day.

 Disability rights groups had in previous elections spent their own money to travel to polling stations and conduct audits. They submitted data to election officials. On Monday, corporation engineers from each of the seven wards in RK Nagar accompanied the groups in their official vehicles. Activists hope the inclusion drive will continue for other upcoming elections as part of their work. “We covered 98% of the booths today and most of them are inaccessible,” said Smitha Sadasivan of Disability Rights Alliance. “All booths will require different kinds of infrastructure modifications. All toilets are in a bad shape.” 
 
 The organisation had previously conducted audits across Tamil Nadu ahead of the   elections in May last year and had found that half of the ramps at polling booths in   were inaccessible. It also found several obstructions to people with disabilities. Returning officer Praveen Nair has assured disability rights groups that all systemic voters' education and electoral participation (SVEEP) activities will be made inclusive.
