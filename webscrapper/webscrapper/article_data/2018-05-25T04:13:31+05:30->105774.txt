NEW DELHI:   on Thursday alleged there was a hidden hand of the Central government behind the police action on protestors in  , saying that the Modi government had tweaked rules to help the industrial group set up shop in  .

 
 AICC spokesman   said the NDA government had changed the norms on setting up industry.
 
 He said if an industry was to be set up, public consultation was required. But in December 2014, the rule was changed to state that if a project was situated in an industrial zone, there was no need for environmental clearance and thus no need for public consultation.
 
 Saying the same Sterlite project was evicted from Maharashtra, Singhvi asked the government to reveal who helped Sterlite set up the plant in TN. The spokesman said the PM had been giving much “gratuitous advice to rulers of Tamil Nadu”, and even linked him to AIADMK’s non-stop protest and disruption of   over the Cauvery issue during the budget session. “Why is our eloquent and tweet-a-minute PM silent on Tuticorin,” he asked.
 
 Singhvi asked the PM to respond if he thought the TN government should be dismissed over the brutal police action on protestors. “You are all running on a treadmill but getting nowhere. You are fit for a camera but not fit for governance,” Congress said.
