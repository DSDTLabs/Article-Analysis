 According to the candidates who appeared for the examination at TISK English Medium School at Kovvappuram near Kunhimangalam in Payyannur, the girls were asked to remove dresses with metal hooks or buttons because the rules did not permit them to allow metallic items inside the examination halls.
 
 "It is shocking that my daughter had to undergo such an ordeal and remove her   to appear for the examination but there was no other option and she was forced to do so," said Renuka, mother of a girl who appeared for the exam.
 
 "I am a teacher and I know the psychology of the teenagers; this will definitely affect their confidence, and we are thinking of taking legal measures," she added.
 
 The girl said though she appeared for the examination after undergoing coaching in Thrissur for one year, the incident shattered her. "I am a 19-year-old girl and such incidents shatter us beyond imagination. I don't know how I appeared for the examination," she said.
 
 Another parent, Rajesh Nambiar, said his daughter had to change her pair of jeans because it had metal buttons and pockets.
 
 
 
 
 Many girls faced similar ordeal but they and their parents kept quiet, said Rajesh.
 
 "After the examination, I came to know that a Muslim family in the neighbourhood gave dress to at least six girls and some of them had to 
  too as the rules did not permit full sleeve tops," he said.
 
 Though TOI tried to contact the CBSE officials, they were not available for comments.
