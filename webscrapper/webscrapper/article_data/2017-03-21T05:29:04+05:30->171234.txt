GHAZIABAD: To expedite construction of a motorable road from   to Noida and Greater Noida West, residents of the township have decided to hold a meeting with   officials, the builders and residents of Rishpalgarhi village on March 25.

 The absence of a proper approach and exit road from the township is one of the major civic concerns for around 25,000 residents here, according to T P Tyagi, president,   (AoA). The narrow stretch that passes through NH-24 often gets choked with traffic during rush hours. 
 
 The Allahabad high court stayed the construction of an alternative route from the highway to Greater Noida West via Rishpalgarhi village in the wake of a dispute between GDA, Crossings Infrastructure Private Limited ( ), and the villagers on March 3. 
 
 “We are trying to reach an amicable settlement between the builder and the villagers for the welfare of the residents,” Tyagi added. 
 
 The decision was taken in a meeting between members of the township’s AoA federation, GDA officials and a representative from the village.
 
 GDA tehsildar RK Mittal informed around 1,200 metres of disputed land requires clearance in order to construct the road. Meanwhile, CIPL chief executive officer Mukesh Tomar said CIPL had not received any official notice from the GDA. “We can comment only when we receive official notifications,” he said.
