Manali: A cloudburst near Dhundi, about 17km from Manali, washed away approach road to Rohtang tunnel at two places while another cloudburst in Kundugad area of Anni subdivision of Kullu damaged three old houses on Tuesday night.

 Torrential rains in many parts of Kullu district have triggered massive landslides and blocked roads. Rainfall in Anni created flash flood-like conditions on Tuesday night and damaging three old uninhabited houses. The flood waters also swept away large swathes of agricultural land.
 
 Anni subdivisional magistrate Pankaj Sharma said while one house was damaged severely, two others were partially affected. “The stream in the area was also inundated due to torrential rainfall. The locals are being provided relief material. Following heavy rainfall forecast in coming days, an advisory has been issued in the area for people to stay away from rivers and rivulets,” he said.
 
 A cloudburst between Dhundi and Solang damaged the Rohtang tunnel approach road at MSP-3 and MSP-7 around 11pm on Tuesday. The downpour in upper areas resulted in landslides, the heavy flow of water bringing down tonnes of debris which damaged the road and culverts. Although the avalanche control structure withstood the flood, the debris entered the gallery area.
 
 An official said the traffic on the road had come to a standstill and that work to clear the debris had started early in the morning. The road at MSP-3, about 14km from Manali, was also repaired in the morning and workers were deployed to rebuild the road at MSP-7 by late Wednesday evening.
 
 Kullu-Luhri road has also been blocked after landslide at Kotnala. Aut-Sainj road has also witnessed landslide. Most parts of Himachal are witnessing heavy rainfall frequently. Water level in rivers and rivulets has also increased. There was no loss of life so far.
