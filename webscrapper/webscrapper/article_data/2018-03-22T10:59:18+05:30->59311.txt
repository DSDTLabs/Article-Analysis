BHOPAL: The Budget session of   was adjourned sine die a week ahead of schedule amid   over   and Congress’ insistence on admitting an   on the suicide by the PWD minister’s daughter-in-law Preity Raghuvanshi.

 Calling it a “black day” for MP,   members moved a no-confidence motion against Speaker Sitasharan Sharma for refusing to hold a discussion on Preity’s suicide. Congress leaders said they will sit on dharna outside the chief minster’s residence and launch a statewide agitation against the BJP government.
 
 Pandemonium broke out in the House almost as soon as it assembled in the morning. Opposition and treasury benches had heated exchanges over admissibility of the debate on the suicide and issues related to women safety, leading to five adjournments.
 
 Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh accused the government of trying to avoid a serious matter. “The Speaker did not allow adiscussion on the issue on Tuesday, after which BJP changed its agenda to complete the entire business in a day before the House was adjourned sine die. I am a member of the assembly since 1985 and have never seen a budget passed without discussion. This is a black day for the state,” Singh told reporters.
