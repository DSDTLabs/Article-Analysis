It seems that love stories span decades every time Prithviraj and   get together for a film. If the duo's romantic hit Ennu Ninte Moideen was set in the 60s and 70s, their upcoming movie My Story has them romancing in the 90s till the current period. 

 The film, directed by debutant  , had already finished an extensive schedule in Portugal. 
 'It's an all-out romance and I have tried to create one for the ages. It's quite different from both Prithvi's and Parvathy's previous film together. My Story is more of a feel-good love story with a modern backdrop. It is also set in two time periods ' in 1995 and today,' says Roshni. 'The movie celebrates love; it's not just about a day or two in the year but about an entire lifetime.' 
 
  With one of the film's settings going back to the 90s, the costume and styling departments were on their toes, says Roshni, who had also provided her inputs based on her experience in Telugu, Kannada and Tamil film industries as costume designer.
  'If you observe the films of the 90s such as Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, you would notice that was the starting phase of contemporary fashion; whatever is prevalent right now is just an evolution of the style of that era. So, it was easier to weave in those elements in the film,' says the debutante director. 'Both Prithvi and Parvathy will be seen in fresh avatars in both the time periods.'
 
  On working with the two stars, Roshni says, 'They are both brilliant actors, who are very involved in their characters. Parvathy is the soul of the movie and the film traverses the different stages of Prithviraj's character's life.'
