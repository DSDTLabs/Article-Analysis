KOHIMA: In poll-bound Nagaland-where Christians are in the majority-Congress has promised voters a visit to the Holy Land (Jerusalem) at a subsidized cost if voted to power. This is being seen as a policy of appeasement as in the case of subsidized Haj pilgrimages for minorities that previous governments at the Centre had indulged in. 

 The Nagaland Pradesh   Committee (NPCC), which had released its election manifesto for the state assembly polls on February 9 on the social media instead of releasing it at an official function as is the custom, has said the party would set up a board to facilitate Christians to visit Jerusalem. "By an Act of the state government, a board will be established to facilitate minorities to visit the Holy Land at a subsidized cost," the NPCC manifesto said.
 
 Congress is trying to appease the Christians-who constitute about 88% of the population in Nagaland-at a time when the Nagaland Baptist Church Council (NBCC) had come out against Hinduvta forces 'invading' Nagaland. NBCC is very critical of   and RSS making inroads in the state.
 
 BJP is believed to have made a similar promise to the Christians of a  , though for free. However, the state BJP unit said the party is yet to release its election manifesto for Nagaland. "Whatever is circulated on the social media or for that matter what leaders say are their personal opinions and not the views of BJP," a state BJP leader here said. Incidentally, BJP recently dropped the scheme of subsidized Haj pilgrimage for minorities. The leader added that the BJP election manifesto would be released on February 16.
 
 A BJP source, however, admitted that the offer of free trips to Jerusalem was leaked out from the election broadcast script of BJP which was submitted to the All India Radio. "The party has not officially announced it, but the script must have leaked somehow," said the source.
