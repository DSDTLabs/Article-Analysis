ROHTAK: Former   speaker and   Kuldeep Sharma said on Saturday that the countdown for the ruling   had begun and the people had become disillusioned with the party.

 Addressing a press conference at Canal rest house here, along with another Congress MLA Karan  , Sharma said the regime of the day had robbed the youth of jobs and traders of business.
 
 Taking a dig at Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Sharma said the CM could not undertake any developmental work in Karnal and had looked for a safe seat in Gurgaon. “But his dreams shattered after the poor show of the saffron party in recent municipal corporation elections in Gurgaon. Now, Khattar wants to try his luck at the Rohtak assembly seat,” he alleged.
 
 Meanwhile, Palwal MLA Dalal alleged that the BJP government in the state had blood on its hands and it had been exposed for the third time during the handling of the   head   Ram Rahim Singh’s conviction recently when his followers resorted to large-scale violence in Panchkula and other parts of the state.
 
 Dalal alleged that the dera followers killed at Panchkula on August 25 after Gurmeet’s conviction were from the scheduled caste community and were allowed to assemble in the town and were later shot dead. He said according to the government records only 40 persons were killed while 20 more followers of the dera head had gone missing.
