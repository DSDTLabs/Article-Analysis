LUDHIANA: If the MC’s claim of rat infestation leading to a wall of the   flyover collapsing on Sunday night is true, more bridges and flyovers in the city are awaiting a similar fate.

 This is because the civic body has established garbage dumps under more flyovers in the city. Such dumps are located under bus stand flyover,   and many points on Delhi-Amritsar road. The dumps end up leading to rat infestations, and attracting stray cattle, who defecate on the walls and weaken them. Because of regular defecation, road under the bus stand flyover has been damaged.
 
 Even MC officials admitted to the dumps located under flyovers being risky. They, however, said it was difficult for them to come up with alternatives as residents opposed any move to shift garbage dumps.
 
 Meanwhile, people living around Gill Chowk flyover said the company hired for managing the city’s garbage, A2Z, did not collect waste regularly. “Though they don’t usually collect waste, they were exceptionally quick today,” said a resident.
 
 Even MP  , when asked about these dumps, told mayor Balkar   to order a survey of such dumps in the city. He asked the mayor to remove dumps in case there is danger to any of the bridges. Sandhu, however, said they had now proposed to install static compactors at many important locations of the city, so that the problem of too much garbage could come to end.
