NAGPUR:  , the nursery of football in the region, failed to impress the scouts of Pune-based   on Thursday. A day after, they short-listed six talented youngsters from city for their trials scheduled in Pune, the technical staff from India's first International Club residential academy selected just one player from Kamptee.

 After the two-and-half hour long session, Shivajians felt satisfied with the skills of 2002-born left winger Bhuunesh Shendre as others failed to impress the experienced coaches. The two-day selection trials that concluded at the Military ground in Kamptee saw a gathering of about 50 football enthusiasts from Kamptee and nearby areas.
 
 After the warming up session, all the four observers including 'A' license coach  ,  ,   and   made the participants work on the basics of the game like passing, receiving, trapping, controlling and space making. Thereafter, they divided the players in two groups and made them play a game to observe the reading capacity during the match.
 
 "After the opening day response, we were expecting a crowded field in Kamptee. I was told that this place is the nursery of football in Vidarbha. All those who have attended the trials were good in some or the other aspect of the game but somehow missed our requirement. Some had speed and skills but were a bit short," Deggie Cardozo told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Giving more information about the future course of these seven selected players Deggie said, "All these seven players - six from Nagpur and Kamptee's Bhuunesh -have to reach our academy in Pune on May 28. They will stay and work with our coaches for a week and then a final list of selected players will be declared."
 
 Deggie also had a word of caution for the selected players. "Of course we have picked these seven kids but it won't be easy for them to book their berth in the academy. First, they have to play their best possible game in the final selection (at Pune) to impress the panel of selectors," he signed off.
