Actress   is going places. 

 The pretty girl whose last film in Malayalam was the hit film  , has now bagged another plum role in noted director P T Kunju Muhammed's upcoming movie, Viswasapoorvam Mansoor.
 On her role, the Pisaasu actress says, 'I play Mumtaz, a Malayali girl who comes back to her home state, Kerala, along with her mom after surviving a riot. She is an orthodox Muslim girl.'
 
  fame   plays her romantic interest in the film. 'Mumtaz and her mom seek shelter in Mansoor's house and they strike a friendship, which later turns to love. The movie progresses as their bond strengthens,' she adds.
 The film is about a romance that happens amidst a lot of social issues prevailing in contemporary Kerala. 'It talks about the current political scenario, terrorism and so on. I am also glad to be part of a P T Kunju Muhammed movie. Like his previous films, Magrib and Garshom, this is also going to be an eye-opener,' she says.
 The film will go on floors by the end of February. Apart from Prayaga and Roshan, the film has Gautami, Shweta Menon, Leona Lishoy and Renji Panicker playing pivotal roles.
