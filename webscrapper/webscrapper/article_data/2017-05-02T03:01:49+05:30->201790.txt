GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad   court has given the go-ahead to the central probe agency for the extradition of  , a former IPS officer who is an accused in the   case and now settled in the UK.

 Judge Rajesh Choudhary of CBI’s anti-corruption court gave the go-ahead on Monday, a few days after the investigating agency submitted a dossier pertaining to Belur and sought three months’ time to initiate the extradition process.
 
 Belur, an IPS officer of 1993 batch, was on her first posting as the circle officer of Modinagar when four persons, aged between 17 and 23, were shot dead in a fake encounter by her subordinates in 1996.
 
 On February 22 this year, the CBI court convicted four cops in the case and sentenced them to life imprisonment. But Belur remained the missing link in the case as she had failed to appear in the court during the trial. Though the CBI did not name her as an accused in the chargesheet, the court by invoking Section 319 of CrPc treated her as an accused and in 2007 she was issued summons.
 
 Her role in the case came under the scanner after the CBI investigation revealed that a bullet found in the body of Jasbir Singh, one of the victims, was fired from her service revolver. Though Belur did not resign, she left the job midway and went to London. The Union home ministry had, on November 21 last year, termed her as deemed to have resigned for being absent from duty since October 1, 2005.
