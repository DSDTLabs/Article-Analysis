 is apparently a great fan of the film Godha. The director recently posted on his facebook page his appreciation of the movie, in glowing terms. "Watched Basil's   ! I have had also seen Kunjiramayanam, and in the very next film the director made a big progress in the making style and narration. One of the best in the new league of directors ! I feel lucky to pick up the cameraman and the music director of Godha in my new film. Both made magic," he wrote.

 Lal Jose has also praised each and every artist in the movie separately, and even admits that he is jealous of Renji Panikker! "Tovino, you learnt the art of subtle performance so well, making the audience love you in all your scenes. I officially declare my jealousy to   for being ...so fit and strong :D After 'Jacobinte Swargarajyam', you climbed up to the next step here.
 
 Finally, the one made me fall for the film is the heroine, a pure talent sharpened with hard work!
 
 Mass claps for all of you guys ! Enjoy the success! (sic)."
