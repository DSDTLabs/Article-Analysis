NEW DELHI: A fake   agency running a call centre that lured more than 60 people from   promising to help them invest in a dubious scheme named “Make in India” has been busted. The fraudsters would pose as officials from a fictitious agency called Governing Body of Insurance Council (GBIC) and offer to help with lapsed insurance policies. Police suspect them of duping victims to the tune of Rs 1 crore. A case of cheating has been registered.

 The kingpins of the  , Naveen Gupta, Sunil Shah, Sumit Kapoor and   were arrested from the call centre in Tilak Nagar.
 
 Additional DCP Chinmoy Biswal said that a complaint was received from  , a resident of  , wherein it was reported that beginning from November 2016, he had been receiving calls on his mobile phone from a purported representative of GBIC, who said he was calling from its grievance redressal cell.
 
 Sethi did not suspect their intentions as the caller had the correct details of various insurance policies which had been purchased by the complainant in the past but which had, for various reasons, lapsed before they could attain maturity. The accused asked him to deposit Rs 10 lakh to clear the dues. However, after depositing the money, when Sethi tried to contact them further, the number was found to be switched off.
 
 “A team led by ACP KP Kukreti and SHO Gagan Bhaskar was formed to track down the numbers from which the calls were made and they were traced to the west Delhi locality,” said Biswal.
