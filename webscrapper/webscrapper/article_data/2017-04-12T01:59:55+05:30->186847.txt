GURUGRAM: Seven people were booked for allegedly   on an   match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.

 The men were   from a slum in  , after cops raided the place on being tipped off by an informer. “We got secret information from an informer that gambling was going on, and raided the place immediately,” said ASI Ravinder Singh, the investigating officer.
 
  police station registered an FIR against the seven accused — Satish, Prince, Bhasan, Jiarool Sekh, Firoj, Rahul Mandal, Bappan Mandal — under Section 13A of the Public Gambling Act. The accused were produced before a magistrate on Monday and later released on bail.
 
 According to the FIR, the match was playing on an LED screen while Prince, one of the accused, was writing down notes on the match score card and money the gamblers had bet, in a notebook. It also mentions a conversation between the punter and the bookie, in which Satish, another accused, was asking a person on the phone to make a bet.
 
 Police also recovered Rs 78,000 from the accused.
 
 ASI Ravinder said it does not appear the gamblers are linked to any larger racket. “These are men aged between 25 and 35, working in private companies. They were placing bets on probability of runs scored by specific overs,” he said.
