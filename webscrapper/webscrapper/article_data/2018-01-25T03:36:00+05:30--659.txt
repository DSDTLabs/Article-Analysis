MUMBAI: Over 3,000 unaided   in the state are firm about their decision to not admit students under the   quota until the government clears their dues for the past five years. 

 While the government claims that it owes schools only about Rs 150 crore for around 2.60 lakh students, managements said the figures were at least four times higher.
 
 All unaided non-minority schools in the state are required to reserve 25% seats at the entry-level for students from economically backward sections. Schools have been doing so since 2012. 
 
 Various private unaided school associations have come to form an umbrella body – Federation of Schools Association,   and decided they would wait for the funds to be reimbursed for the students they have admitted starting 2012. “We are giving students quality education but we cannot continue if we do not get the money,” said SC Kedia, honorary secretary, Unaided School Forum. The schools claimed the state has been threatening them with de-recognition and police complaints for some time now. “We have already informed the state that we wouldn’t admit students unless our dues are cleared. If the state still sends students to school, it will create a problem,” said Rajendra Singh, secretary, Independent English School Association of Maharashtra. 
 
 The association said the reimbursements are much higher. “The government’s calculation is only for the first years,” said Singh.
 
 The associations have also filed a writ in the HC. 
 
  However, education department officials said the figures would be updated once the schools upload student details.
 
 “All dues shall be cleared by March-end,” said education minister Vinod Tawde.
