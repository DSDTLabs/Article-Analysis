Over 400 tourists, including some from  , have been stranded at Leh due to inclement weather for a while now. City-based fitness professional  , who returned to Hyderabad safely last Monday narrated her ordeal to Hyderabad Times. 
 After reaching Leh on January 20, Kiran and her team began trekking in Chadar in   for about one week. But, soon the pleasure trip turned out to be a nightmare when heavy   hit the region, recalls Kiran. “Trekking became dangerous as the temperature had dipped to minus 38 degree. In fact one of my friends fell in the river when the ice gave way. It was nerve-racking to continue trekking without knowing when the ice will give way,” she says. 
 The stranded trekkers also faced accommodation issues and none of the ATMs were functioning at the airport, where they had to wait endlessly due to cancelled flights. But, after spending two days at the airport, Kiran finally managed to return to Hyderabad. Now, she is praying for her friends still stuck in Leh. “Many of my friends are still stuck there. Most of them were staying at the airport. When I came back, I got to know that now they are asking people to vacate the airport. But where will people go in the dead cold? ATMs were not functioning, nobody had money left and almost everybody’s phones were dead. Some of my friend’s found refuge at a local’s house. The Army had helped some others who were stuck there,” she said, adding that some passengers will come back on Friday.
