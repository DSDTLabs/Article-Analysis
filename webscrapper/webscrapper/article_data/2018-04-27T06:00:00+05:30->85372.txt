Why did director   decide to walk out of   biopic, less than one month after Vice President   gave the clap for the muhurat shot of the film? That’s the big question on everyone’s mind since news broke that director Teja has walked out of the film on Wednesday evening. 

 Grapevine has it that the   director decided to call it quits due to creative differences with Balakrishna, who is playing NTR in the movie. “Balakrishna and Teja have been at loggerheads since the start of the project. Teja was miffed with actor-politician for interfering too much and imposing his vision on the film. He didn’t want to be reduced to a puppet and felt it was better to walk out of the project instead,” reveals a source close to the director. 
 
 Members of the film’s unit though allege that “Teja couldn’t handle such a massive project” and walked out because it was out of his depth. “It was too much for him to handle. He got scared since it is a biopic of one of the biggest legends of Telugu cinema. Soon after beginning shoot for it, Teja began to feel uneasy that he has taken on a project that was too massive for him and it was more than what he could handle,” alleged a source from the film’s unit.
 
 Apparently Teja walked out with Balayya’s blessings. “There are no differences with anybody. On the contrary, everybody is happy and have come to a mutual agreement that this was the best way forward. Teja personally met Balakrishna and expressed his concerns, which he understood. Now, the makers are looking for a big director to replace him,” the source added. Names of veteran director K Raghavendra Rao, Puri Jagannadh and Krish have been doing the rounds as possible replacements for Teja.
