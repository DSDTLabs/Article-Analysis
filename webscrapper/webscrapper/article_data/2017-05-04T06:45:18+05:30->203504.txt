MUMBAI: With   farmers saddled with 10 lakh tonnes of produce and staring at huge losses following a bumper production, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday said his government would bring in a law to make purchase of agricultural produce below the minimum support price (MSP) a punishable offence. 

 The minimum support price (MSP) for each crop is announced by the central government and is common for all the states. According to rules, traders must not purchase produce from farmers at any price lesser than the MSP. However, these norms are not being followed leading to massive exploitation of and loss for farmers.
 
 Since the tur prices started falling following a good production, the Fadnavis government has been under fire for its failure to ensure farmers didn't suffer losses. Tur farmers have been at the receiving end of the demand and supply gap.
 
 Tur production has touched at an all-time high this year at 20 lakh tonnes, as against 4.44 lakh tonnes last year
 
 "Most traders have purchased tur at prices below MSP this year, yet no action has been initiated by the government. The traders do not give purchase receipts to farmers so that even if they lodge a complaint, there's no evidence," an activist said.
 
 In the absence of any intervention by the government, which is also going slow in re-opening tur purchase centres, traders at key tur market yards have slashed prices drastically. The auction of tur in the Akola market yard started at Rs 3,000 per quintal as against Rs 3600-Rs 4000 two days ago. The MSP for tur is Rs5,050. 
 
 "The state government has managed to open only 11 centres so far. Taking advantage of the situation, traders are slashing prices. And farmers are selling their produce for want of a better option," said a official from Akola APMC.
