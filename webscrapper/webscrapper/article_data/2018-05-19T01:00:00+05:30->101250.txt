 Nushrat’s inimitable sense of humour was on display at the party, too. Quoting a dialogue from her last release, ' ' (she played Sweety in the film) she told BT, “I have turned 16 today and if anybody tells you otherwise, please ask them, ‘Main kya shakal se jhoothi lagti hoon?’ I have told my guests to forget everything and just have fun.”
 
 When asked if she had gifted herself anything special, the actress replied, “I gifted my mother a car. She wanted to buy one, but the plan was put on hold because I bought a four-wheeler. Fortunately, my film did well and I made some money (smiles), so, I bought it for her. I am gifting myself a 10-day trip to London with my girl gang.”
