KOLKATA: The   (ICC) on Thursday sounded the death knell for the   — the second-biggest 50-overs tournament after the World Cup. The 2021 Champions Trophy, scheduled to be held in India, will be converted into a   meet, the   confirmed at the end of its five-day quarterly conclave here.

 
 
 
 With one World T20 already slated for 2020 in Australia, there will now be two T20 world championships in successive years (2020 and 2021). Thereafter, the tournament will be held every two years. 
 
 Addressing the media, ICC chief executive   disclosed that member nations had voted unanimously for the switch at its board meeting in February. It is now set to be ratified at its annual conclave in Dublin in June.
 
 The move is part of ICC's efforts to promote T20 in a bid to get it included in the Olympic Games. "We always knew the T20 format is the vehicle for growing the game and transforming it from being a sport played by a few countries to a truly global sport," Richardson said.
 
 Richardson also confirmed that efforts are on to persuade the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to include cricket in the Olympics. With Paris scheduled to host the 2024 Olympics, there may not be enough time to get cricket in, but ICC is optimistic about the sport's inclusion in the 2028 Los Angeles Games.
 
 Recognising the appeal of T20 cricket, the ICC plans to accord "international status" to all T20 Internationals played among its 104 member nations with a global ranking system to boot. The ICC made it clear that the new system would not include franchise T20 leagues or any privately-promoted tournaments.
 
 "All member women's teams will be awarded T20I status on July 1, 2018, while all men's teams will be awarded T20I status on January 1, 2019, following the cut-off point for qualification to the ICC World T20 2020. Rankings for women and men will be introduced in October 2018 and May 2019, respectively," the ICC said in a statement.
 
 The 2017 Champions Trophy held in England is thus likely to be the last edition of the hugely popular 50-overs tournament, which means that Pakistan — who won the tournament beating India in the final at The Oval last year — may not be able to defend their crown. Initially christened the 'ICC Knockout' meet when it was launched in Dhaka in 1998, the tournament was rechristened 'Champions Trophy' in 2002 when it was held in Sri Lanka.
 
 The World Cup will now be the only major ICC tournament in the 50-overs format. The next edition of the World Cup will be held in UK in 2019 and it will remain a quadrennial event, with India hosting the 2023 edition.
