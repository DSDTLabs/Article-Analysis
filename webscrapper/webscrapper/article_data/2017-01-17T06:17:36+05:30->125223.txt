ASANSOL: Union minister Babul Supriyo’s convoy was allegedly attacked by   supporters on Monday, when he went on a “regular visit” to Andal-based Durgapur Steel Thermal Power Plant. Babul, who posted a 45-second video on Twitter, showing   escorting him on deserted streets at 5.45pm, also informed Union home minister   and BJP president Amit Shah about it. The Trinamool, however, dismissed the incident as “yet another drama”. 

 Sporting black badges and brandishing festoons, banners and flags, Trinamool supporters, led by Andal block party president Aloke Mondal, were reportedly staging a demonstration at Andal crossing against demonetisation on Monday afternoon. It was around that time that Babul and his daughter and parents reportedly reached the spot. Protesters upped their pitch, apparently on seeing him. The crowd reportedly raised a slogan of “Go back Babul”. “As my car was entering the venue, Trinamool activists shouted slogans and pelted my car with stones,” Babul alleged. Reporting the matter to his seniors in the government as well as party, he vowed: “Come what may, I will enter (the plant).” Babul even complained the assistant commander of CISF asked the local police for help, but to no avail.
 
 A local BJP leader, Amitabha Banerjee, who was claimed to be with Babul, said the minister returned to GT Road, saw his family off and then came to the plant. Escorted by the CISF, Babul visited the thermal power plant.
 
 Trinamool’s Mondal, however, said: “Not a single stone was hurled and no one was hit. This is yet another of his dramas.”
 
 Posting the 45-second video, Babul compared the scene to Syria: “Look at this, am I in Syria? And it is (only) 5.45pm... Deserted streets with CISF on both sides. Such a shame and I was on an official DSTPS visit.”
