HYDERABAD: Four months after CBI booked a cheating and forgery case against city-based electronics company   Ltd, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has begun a probe into a suspected loan fraud of Rs 134 crore under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

 Highly-placed sources said   had first taken a loan in 2007 by submitting false financial statements which were enhanced on numerous occasions. “The directors of PCH Retail hatched a conspiracy and fraudulently diverted the credit facilities to fictitious companies floated by them and others and siphoned off funds of various banks,” said CBI and ED sources.
 
 
 The ED is now in the process of identifying the properties of the accused and the route under which the fraud was committed so that the assets can be attached under PMLA. CBI had booked the case against PCH Retail MD Balvinder Singh, director   and others in December 2017 for fraudulently obtaining Rs 134-crore loan from   commercial branch in Secunderabad.
 
 Accused produced fake papers: CBI
 
 CBI’s argument is that the accused had produced fake documents and part of the loan amount had been fraudulently diverted to purchase personal properties. Chartered accountant Bhavesh R Vithlani and director of   Tarn Jyoty Singh were also named as accused.
 
 PCH Retail’s SBI account was classified as an NPA on September 28, 2013. “Out of the loan amount, ?2.76 crore was fraudulently transferred to Versant Home Appliances Ltd for purchase of immovable property. The property was later transferred to Balvinder’s daughter. The accused caused wrongful loss to the tune of ?134 crore to SBI,” CBI said.
 
 The agency booked a case of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, using forged document as genuine, falsification of accounts and criminal misconduct of SBI officials.
