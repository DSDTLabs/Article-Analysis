Coimbatore: More than 100 ophthalmic surgeons from across the country walked with Sourav Ganguly, the former Indian cricketer in the city on Friday. The doctors, nurses and administrators working in the sector of eye-sight took part in a walkathon held by All India Ophthalmologist Society as part of their 76th annual conference at CODISSIA trade fair complex.

 At the event, Sourav Ganguly said that eye-sight was the most important and we should all be thankful for the gifted vision. “If any other part of the body is affected, though painful, we can overcome it due to the latest technology. But once we lose our vision, everything becomes meaningless. So we need to take care of our eyes and now there are many technologies to detect eye diseases well in advance,” he said. Stressing on fitness, he said like the young Indian cricket team focused on fitness, everyone should work on it. “A small walk or some work out every day is important. While people can eat what they like, they should ensure they eat healthy,” said Ganguly.
