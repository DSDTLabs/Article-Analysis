PATNA: Controversy marked the first day of   of the   (BSEB) on Wednesday with the question paper of English reportedly going viral on WhatsApp in Samastipur, albeit after the examination commenced.

  denied any leak, saying a few journalists claimed the leak, but he had not got any proof. “Even if the question paper was leaked on WhatsApp while the students were inside the examination centre, that cannot be considered as leak,” he said and added, however, that the matter would be probed.
 
 BSEB chairman Anand Kishor also denied the leak, citing the same logic. Sources, however, said he has asked the Samastipur administration to probe the matter. 
 
 The shift began at 9.30am and continued till 12.45pm while a teacher in Samastipur told TOI he saw the English question paper on a cellphone around 12 noon.
 
 While examinees, invigilators and the staff of centres are not allowed to carry cellphones, the BSEB has permitted only the centre superintendents and magistrates on examination duty to carry their mobile phones. 
 
 The BSEB has also directed the officials concerned to frisk the candidates and make sure they did not carry any gadget inside the examination centres.
 
 The question that remains unanswered is, did someone from outside the examination centres leak the question paper. Or, were there lapses in frisking the examinees as a result of which someone, if not many or all of them, managed to carry the gadget inside the examination centre and leaked the question paper?
 
 Meanwhile, BSEB sources said 28 examinees were expelled for using unfair means and 24 others arrested for writing the paper in place of others on Day 1 of the examinations being held at 1,532 centres across the state.
 
 The 17.63 lakh and odd candidates, who have filled the form for the exams, include 8.66 lakh girls. The examinations will end on March 8.
