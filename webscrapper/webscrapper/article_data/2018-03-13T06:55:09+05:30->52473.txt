PATIALA:   ( ) has again roped in Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC) to collect geospatial data of farm fires ahead of the wheat harvest which would be beginning next month. Last year, the board had, for the first time, used the satellite imagery provided by the PRSC to get real-time data of farm fires, which were reported to the district monitoring committees for prompt action against the violators. 

 Wheat harvest in Punjab starts around mid-April. Statistics of last year show that a total of 12,321 instances of wheat stubble burning had been caught by keeping a watch from the skies. Out of these, environmental compensations of Rs 34.70 lakh had been imposed in 966 cases out of which a sum of Rs 11.45 lakh had been recovered by the state agencies.
 
 PPCB had paid Rs 7 lakh to the PRSC to ensure that district committee receive SMSs (text messages) alerts in real-time. This year also, the same process is being adopted.
 
 During the paddy season in 2017, the number of farm fires caught using the satellites were 43,660. The details of environmental compensation imposed and recoveries made from the farmers is still being kept under the wraps as the district level monitoring committees had failed to initiate action against the violators after Chief Minister   had said that the government could not take action against the farmers as they were already under huge financial burdens.
 
 PPCB chairperson   said as the nodal agency, the board would be collecting all data of farm fires and share it with the concerned district-level committees that had been constituted last year to check stubble burning. He said it would be for the district-level committees to initiate action against the violators.
 
 Meanwhile, agricultural experts said as wheat residue was generally used a cattle fodder by majority of farmers, the number of instances where growers burn crop residue was less as compared to paddy.
