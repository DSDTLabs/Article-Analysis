NAVI MUMBAI: As if commuting in the torrential rains was not enough, the   of   have to deal with pathetic roads during their commute every single day. On one hand the Sion Panvel highway is full of potholes, the Sanpada   is nothing less.

 In fact the condition of the underpass worsens with every monsoon. The underpass is hardly maintained by the authorities which is why the bad condition. “This underpass which sees considerable vehicular movement on daily basis is hardly maintained by any of the authorities. Be it railways, cidco or the NMMC on one seems to be bothered about the condition of the road. As a result the stretch has become absolutely unfit for travelling. But since it is the shortest route to Vashi, APMC marker many motorists have no choice but to take this stretch,” said Rehan Shaikh a resident.
 
 Unlike the roads, the underpass has tiles are chipping and loosening. “Many tiles here have chipped away creating sharp edges making it difficult for motorists to drive. Also the tiles become slippery due to the water logging. The authorities need to look into the matter and fix it before any major mishap takes place,” said another resident of sector 4 Anuprita Pawar.
 
 Repeated attempts to contact CIDCO went unanswered. — Sameera Kapoor Munshi
