PUNE:  , the Indian Army’s senior-most military intelligence (MI) officer, said there is a need to strengthen their intelligence gathering capability, given the sharp rise in casualties among MI personnel in the last  

 Thirty five military intelligence personnel were killed in the line of duty since 1980, and given the increasing prominence of the intelligence corps, a most robust way of gathering intelligence is the need of the hour, said Singh, who is also the commandant of the Military Intelligence Training School and Depot (MINTSD).
 
 “We have to be prepared for every possible scenario as nobody will intimate you before they attack. Therefore, the intelligence gathering capacity has to be strengthened,” Singh told TOI on the sidelines of MINTSD’s platinum jubilee celebrations.
 
 There is increased involvement of intel operatives in sensitive areas like Jammu & Kashmir and the Northeast. They are responsible for counter-intelligence, field security, intelligence acquisition operations, counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism, satellite imagery intelligence and the like. 
 
 Military intelligence personnel have so far received 1,321 awards, including three Military Cross, one  , two Kirti Chakra, eight Shaurya Chakra, two Param Vishisht Seva medal, two Ati Vishisht Seva medals, Three Yudh Seva medals, 58 Vishisth Seva medals and 67 Sena medals.
 
 An intelligence officer said on the condition of anonymity, “Currently, the role of the corps is very decisive, particularly in the areas where counter-insurgency and counter-terrorist operations are carried out regularly. The most challenging factor is to meet the operational requirements of the infantry. The corps’ role in the Myanmar cross-border operation and the surgical strikes across the Line of Control last year was very crucial,” the officer said.
