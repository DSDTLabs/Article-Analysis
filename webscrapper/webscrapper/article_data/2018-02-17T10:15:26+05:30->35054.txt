PUNE: A man having   antecedents was arrested on Thursday night for possessing 14   and cartridges.

 Preliminary investigation of the crime branch revealed the arrested person, Santosh Natu, had sourced the   — two pistols and 12 revolvers — from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Police also seized 25 live cartridges from him. He was looking for prospective buyers to sell them.
 
 Acting on a tip-off, the crime branch sleuths zeroed in on Natu near his residence at Maharshinagar. Two teams — one led by senior inspector Rajendra Kadam, the in-charge of the anti-dacoity cell (ADC) and another by inspector Ram Rajmane, the in-charge of the anti-crime organized cell, southern region, crime branch, were working on certain clues to trace him.
 
 The teams received information that Natu would be visiting his residence at Mukundgar in Maharshinagar with the firearms and decided to take joint action under deputy commissioner of police Pankaj Dahane and assistant commissioner of police  . He was taken into custody near Zambre Palace, close to his residence. A haversack recovered from him led to the recovery of two pistols, 12 revolvers and 25 bullets.
 
 The crime branch lodged an FIR under sections of 3 and 7, read with Section 25 of the Arms Act and Section 37 (1) of the Maharashtra Police Act with the Swargate police. ADC will continue to investigate the case because the source of firearms has to be traced.
 
 A police official, requesting anonymity, said, “Natu travelled to Delhi from Pune by flight. From there, he took private vehicles to meet people known to him at Mathura and Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, and Indore in Madhya Pradesh for purchasing firearms. He then travelled to Shirdi. From there, he reached Pune at the time of his arrest.”
 
 He said, “Natu purchased the firearms to sell them to prospective customers. We suspect he might have established links with criminals and organized syndicates for supplying firearms, which may be used for committing crimes.”
