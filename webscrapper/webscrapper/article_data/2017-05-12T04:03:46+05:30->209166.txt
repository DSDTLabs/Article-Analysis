SURAT: There would be 70   zigzagging among thousand others in the city in two months time. These would be driven by women trained by   (UCD) department of   (SMC). Their auto-rickshaws would be financed by Bank of Baroda at 7 per cent interest subsidy. An auto-rickshaw costs Rs1.75 lakh and the women would need to pay a monthly instalment of Rs3,000. Rajkot is the only other city in Gujarat where five auto-rickshaws are being driven by women but on an experimental basis. 

 Gayatri Jariwala, assistant commissioner and in-charge of the project, said, “We went to areas where people below poverty line live. Large number of women came forward and after scrutiny, out of these 70 women were selected. SMC would provide them training and help them get licence.” 
 
 SMC will help them get work by approaching schools, etc., to ferry children. They can later take passengers in the city. 
 
 “The project is being taken up under   (NULM). We are starting with 70 auto-rickshaws but will train more women if they approach us,” Jariwala said. 
 
 The work to paint auto-rickshaws pink has started together with driving lessons to women. Many petrol pumps in the city do have women employees but pink brigade is a new concept which will help make commuting safe with women as drivers.
