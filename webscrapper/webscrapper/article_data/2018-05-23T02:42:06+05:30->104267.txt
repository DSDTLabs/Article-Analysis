NEW DELHI: Delhi University on Tuesday opposed a plea of   before the Delhi high court seeking details of all students who graduated in   in   — the year   finished his course.

  has challenged a Central Information Commission (CIC) direction to allow inspection of university’s 1978 records.
 
 The university claimed before Justice Rajiv Shakdher that the intervention application filed in the matter is for “gaining cheap publicity”.
 
 “With all seriousness I am opposing it. Can this be a public platform? Can this be a platform for gaining cheap publicity?” Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing DU, argued.
 
 CIC had directed DU to allow inspection of records related to all students who had passed BA degree in 1978, the year according to the university in which PM Narendra Modi had also cleared the examination.
 
 CIC had rejected DU’s stand stating that it was a third party personal information, saying it finds “neither merit, nor legality” in it and directed it to reveal the information.
 
 RTI activists Anjali Bhardwaj, Amrita Johri and Nikhil Dey, in their application, have sought permission to intervene in the petition filed by the university and permission to advance their submissions.
 
 When the judge suggested the counsel for the activists could assist the court as an amicus in the matter, the lawyers for the activists said they have no objection to it and their only concern was that they should be heard. 
 
 However, Mehta said the activists were strangers to the matter between DU and CIC and they cannot be allowed to be heard in the matter.
