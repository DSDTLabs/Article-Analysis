NEW DELHI: To maximize their revenue from the sale of match tickets, Rajkot-based   outfit Gujarat   are keen on playing three of their home games in Uttar Pradesh instead of the already-announced two matches in the upcoming edition of the   (IPL).

 According to top BCCI sources, the Lions have also asked BCCI to consider their request to play those UP matches in Lucknow instead of Kanpur's   stadium.
 
 Sources said the home ground of Rajkot, which is scheduled to stage five games, has a capacity of around 26,000, whereas the Green park stadium in Kanpur can seat 30,000 but some construction work is on there. The Gujarat franchisee is of the opinion that if their matches are shifted to Lucknow stadium at Ekana international cricket stadium, which has a capacity of 40,000, it would help them generate more revenue. "The   have requested the board to make changes in the IPL schedule in order to play more home games in UP, as the revenue stream is better in Lucknow than in Rajkot. Even the capacity of the Lucknow stadium is bigger," a source confirmed the development on Saturday. When TOI tried to reach out to Gujarat Lions' team owner  , he was not available for comments. Sources said BCCI would be inspecting the Lucknow stadium on March 24, as the road surrounding the stadium and a few stands inside the stadium are still to be ready. "If the Ekana authorities are able to complete their construction work in time, the matches could be shifted to Lucknow," a source added.
 
 As per the scheduled announced, the Gujarat Lions are supposed to play two of their IPL home matches in Kanpur -against the Delhi Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad.
