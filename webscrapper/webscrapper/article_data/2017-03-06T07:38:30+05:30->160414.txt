VENKATAPURAM: A day after   discovered an   (IED) planted by   on a   leading to   irrigation project on Saturday , the police have not yet managed to remove the devise.

 There has been no official word as to when the police plan to visit the site and remove the IED and make the road safe for use again.However, local villagers have been asked to block two sides of the road which they did with some branches pulled off from nearby trees in the forest area. The dirt road falls in Venkatapuram mandal of the JayshankarBhupalapally district and the location is just a few kilometres away from the   border. The discovery coming soon after a recent bandh against the Green Hunt Â­ the police search operation against Maoists in the neighbouring Chhattisgarh called by Maoists is believed to have the Telangana poli ce officials wor ried that the IED planted is part of a well planned opera tion by naxals to lure them in to a trap. Local police officials mean while again cautioned vil lagers and shepherds not to enter into the forest as they had no clue as to how many such IEDs may have been planted by Maoists.
 
 Following the IED's discovery and delay by the police to take any follow-up action, it is reliably learnt that several local politicians and others, who were on Maoist hit lists have left Khammam and Warangal and moved to Hyderabad.
