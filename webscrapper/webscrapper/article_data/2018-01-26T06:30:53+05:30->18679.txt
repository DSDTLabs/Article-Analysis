MAHWA(AMRITSAR): Even 16 months after the  , which claimed seven young lives after a school bus fell off the narrow defence bridge near   village in Amritsar, conditions haven’t changed much. Villagers are scared of using the bridge despite it being widened by nearly three feet, as it still doesn’t have a railing.

 On September 20, 2016, seven schoolchildren, including four girls, died after a bus carrying 37 students toppled over a narrow and dilapidated defence bridge and fell in the drain. 13 students had sustained injuries in the accident.
 
 The scope of the tragedy could have been wider but for student Karanbir Singh, who was traveling in the bus on way to school. He had rescued 15 students. He is to be honoured with the coveted Sanjay Chopra award for bravery on the Republic Day.
 
 Karanbir, who is in Delhi to receive the award and participate in Republic Day parade, said he wished government immediately repaired not only Mahwa bridge but all other bridges which were in dilapidated condition.
 
 “The government has spent around Rs 8 lakh. We now need another Rs 3 lakh for the putting up a railing on the bridge,” said sarpanch of Mahwa village   while talking to TOI on Wednesday.
 
 On a visit to the bridge, iron rods were seen protruding on both sides of bridge. Surjit said that bridge was broadened by three feet but there was no grant for the construction of railing, the work of which was left incomplete.
 
 “Now this is now even more dangerous. What if a cyclist slips here? The iron rods will pierce him before he falls into the drain,” said a villager Bachittar Singh. He said government had given financial help to the families whose dear ones had died but it was yet to give job in each family.
 
 An elderly resident of the village   rued that government spends enormous amount on holding functions failed to construct a safe bridge.
