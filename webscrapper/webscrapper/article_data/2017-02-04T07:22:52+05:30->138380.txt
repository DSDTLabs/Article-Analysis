MYSURU: An educational institution in Nanjangud taluk honoured five women teachers with cars for their long service. 

  During its silver jubilee celebrations, the Citizens' Group of Institutions on Ooty Road presented Maruti  , each costing Rs 4.3 lakh, to five teachers who had worked for the institution for 25 years. The celebrations also coincided with the birth anniversary of founder Javeed Ahmed. 
 
 Javeed's wife Mashooda Javeed, now president of the institutions, handed over the car keys to assistant mistress Sandhya K V, assistant mistress Shantha, headmistress  , headmistress   and principal Mythili Lakshman at a function recently. 
 
 Hena told TOI she's delighted to receive this gift. "The teaching profession is said to be a thankless job. Not many recognize our efforts in shaping children's lives. But our institution is different. Every staff member gets an annual award for their service," she said. 
 
  The institution started with 17 kids and three teachers in 1991. Today, the group has a public school, an English school and a PU and degree college. Hena said the institution's present secretary Noor Mohammed Ali was five years old when she joined the school. "He was my student and I'm very proud of him. We're like a family. My elder daughter studied in this school till PUC and joined the JSS Women's College while my younger daughter is a student in this institution," she said. 
 
  " Two years ago, a diamond merchant from Surat gave around 500 cars and more than 200 apartments to his employees who had been working with him for a long time. As we're celebrating our silver jubilee this year, we decided to present cars to five women teachers," Mashooda said.
