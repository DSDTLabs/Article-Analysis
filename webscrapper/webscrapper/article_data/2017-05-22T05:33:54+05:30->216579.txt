HYDERABAD: The Telugu Desam Party in Telangana is determined to prove it is still far from being written off as a   in the state. In the face of being labelled a spent force with no leadership, the   in Telangana is set to hold a   on May 24 at the  

 TDP national president N Chandrababu Naidu is scheduled to address the meeting, party leaders said. Naidu’s participation is to show that the Telangana wing of the party has not been abandoned by him, as is being projected by the ruling TRS.
 
 “The TDP in Telangana has gained in strength. We used to have seven lakh members in the state. The last membership drive earlier this year saw 10 lakh people enrolling as paid members,” a senior state party leader said. 
 
 The one-day   will also see the party leaders, including Kodangal MLA A Revanth Reddy and state unit president L Ramana, explain the “failures of the three-year TRS rule in the state”. The May 24 Mahanadu follows a series of mini-Mahanadus held in all 31 districts. The TDP, which had 15 MLAs in the Assembly, now has only three with 12 crossing over to TRS.
