NAGPUR: Nagpur bench of  , on Tuesday, allowed application of   ( ) to construct Metro stations at Ujjwal Nagar on Wardha Road and Prajapati Nagar at Pardi.

 Even though the MMRCL had completed formalities of taking over the land from Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), it couldn’t go ahead with the construction works following HC’s orders in a PIL, prohibiting any kind of construction on the playgrounds or open spaces, according to MMRCL counsel Kaustubh Devgade.
 
 The MMRCL’s application was listed before a division bench comprising justices   and  , which disposed it of after the hearing. The judges pointed out that metro rail was being constructed for easing out traffic congestion from the roads. The application mentioned that both stations would have commercial and parking spaces for the public.
 
 It was filed in the suo motu PIL based on media reports on playground and open spaces being increasingly encroached. The report had pointed out that due to negligence of civic authorities, including   and NIT, the plots reserved for playgrounds have now turned into garbage dumping yards. A majority of such plots were allegedly encroached by political leaders on the pretext of opening a school or college for charity. Ironically, none of these private schools/colleges is doing charity but exploiting students. Even the charity commissioner's office is ignorant of this violation.
