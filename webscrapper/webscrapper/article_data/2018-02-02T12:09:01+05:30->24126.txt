KOLLAM: While reacting to the slashing of import duty on raw cashew nuts from 5% to 2.5% in the Union budget, the cashew processors here said that it is not a reduction but a total roll back of the import duty that the cashew sector vitally needs for its revival. 

 They feel that even though a 50% reduction in the import duty is significant, it will have no significant effect because it was altogether a new tax slapped on an already ailing industry a couple of years ago.
 
 Minister for cashew industry J Mercykutty Amma said that the reduction of 2.5% is not what the cashew sector expected. She said that a total withdrawal of the import duty was needed and that the state government will approach the Centre again with this demand.
 
 The Cashew Export Promotion council of India (CEPCI), while extending a cautious welcome to the  , said that the cashew fraternity was in fact expecting the withdrawal of import duty and   had made it the first point on its strategic plan submitted to the government.
 
 CEPCI secretary S Kannan said, "Though it is a partial relief, we still request the government to withdraw the duty fully". Since the   in India is not adequate for continuous processing and export, traditionally India is importing raw cashew nut mostly from West African countries.
 
 "Hence, the CEPCI had requested the Union government to withdraw the import duty of 5% on raw cashew nut for uninterrupted processing of cashew and promoting export of cashew kernels until we achieve self-sufficiency in raw cashew nut production," he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, MP N K Premachandran welcomed the reduction in import duty. He said that the sector heavily depends upon import of raw nuts for processing and the import duty contributed to pushing up the cost of production which in turn was a cause for processors closing down the factories. The reduction in duty could bring about a favourable situation to reopen the closed factories, he said.
