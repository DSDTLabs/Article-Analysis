 VVPAT devices were used with EVMs for the first time in just one Assembly constituency of Palair when it went for by-polls in 2016. Now, the VVPATs will be used in all the polling boths and all Assembly and LS constituencies in upcoming elections.
 
 In its directions to the Telangana government, the   said the State should make arrangements for safe custody and storage of VVPATs along with EVMs.
 
 When contacted, deputy chief electoral officer M Satyavani confirmed to TOI that VVPATs would be used in the general elections in the entire State. The State government has taken up construction of warehouses as per ECI guidelines to store VVPATs and EVMs. These warehouses will have no window or even a ventilator as per ECI guidelines. Nearly Rs 30 crore have been sanctioned for the purpose, she said.
 
 Since a large number of EVMs used in earlier Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Telangana are not compatible to be linked up with the VVPAT machines, the Election Commission is making arrangements through   ( ), Hyderabad for supply of new EVMS that are compatible to be linked up with the VVPATs.
 
 It may be mentioned here that VVPAT machines were introduced after political parties alleged that EVMs could be tampered in such a way that votes polled could go in favour of one candidate or a party in favour of which the EVM is rigged.
