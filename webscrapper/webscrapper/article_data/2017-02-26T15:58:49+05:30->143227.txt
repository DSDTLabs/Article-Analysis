Growing up, Niveditha never felt different because of her gender. Her parents raised her to be an independent woman, which is why she recently decided to spend two days alone in Goa, before being joined by her boyfriend. But, unfortunately, she had to ask him to drive down from Bengaluru on the first night of the trip itself, since a walk on the beach turned into a nightmare, thanks to the lewd comments and intrusion of personal space that she was subjected to.

 'After I wrapped up the shoot of my latest film, I set out to Goa. My boyfriend was to meet me there, but I asked him to come after two days, since I wanted to be by myself. On the night that I reached Goa, I went for a walk on the beach around 9 pm, and throughout the 15-minute-long walk, many men passed lewd remarks, followed me and came a little too close for comfort. To avoid them, I walked into a shack, but there were a group of men at the next table, who were laughing and asking me to join them. I dreaded walking back to my hotel alone again, so I asked the server at the shack to accompany me. On the way back, no one troubled me, just because there was a man by my side. I felt very cheap. The general perception is that if a woman is with a man, she automatically belongs to him; if a woman is by herself, then anyone can have a go at her. That struck me hard. I called up my boyfriend after I went back to my room and asked him to come to Goa right away,' says Niveditha. 
 
 The objectification disturbed Niveditha a lot. However, she doesn't want to blame the men for what happened ' that, she says, is an outcome of something being fundamentally wrong in the way our society is constructed.
