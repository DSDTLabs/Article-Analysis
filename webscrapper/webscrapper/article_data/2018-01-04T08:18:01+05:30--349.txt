The relatively-high fee charged by intellectual property law firms forced the intellectual property rights (IPR) cell of   ( ) to file GI applications directly with geographical indications registry (GI Registry) in Chennai. Ten years later, the cell is at the forefront of GI tag applications from Kerala, advising others on the topic.

 “When we first approached legal firms specializing in IPR applications, they were demanding Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000 per application – that too after us doing all the documentation required for the registration. Then we thought, why should we pay somebody for just completing the applications process? I got a book on the topic, studied the Act, looked at the previous applications and finally sent an application to GI registry for   rice,” said professor CR Elsy (plant breeding & genetics), who is also the convener of KAU’s IPR cell.
 
 “When our presentation on Pokkali rice, was completed, GI registry officials in Chennai said it was one of the best applications they had received. As a novice in this IPR regime, this was a morale booster,” Elsy said.
 
 The lessons Elsy and her team learnt were valuable.
 
 Over the past decade, the cell has received eight GI tags, as a result of their direct applications or combined efforts with research institutes or NGOs.
