TV actors   and  , who are currently playing husband-wife on the show Saam Daam Dand Bhed, have apparently struck a great friendship off the camera, too. If sources are to be believed, the two are dating and have found love in each other. Sonal, who recently broke up with actor   after a three-year relationship over compatibility issues, met   on the sets of the show. Varun was earlier linked with actress Surbhi Jyoti. When asked about her relationship status,   said, “Sumit and I have moved on in our lives. I don’t want a relationship immediately after the break-up because it would be on the rebound. Varun is a great guy and I love being around him. He is a good friend and I am just getting to know him better. I don’t know what the future holds for us, I am just enjoying the time I spend 
with him.”
 On his part, Varun dismissed our question with “no comments.”
