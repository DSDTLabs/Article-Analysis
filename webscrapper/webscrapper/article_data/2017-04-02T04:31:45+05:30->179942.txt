New Delhi: Investigation into the modus operandi adopted by an   national, Hamidullah Akbar, arrested for allegedly impersonating, duping and raping an US  , has revealed that the he had also cheated other foreigner women in India in the same way.

 Akbar’s Indian visa expired in December 2013, but he continued staying here and procured a fake voter’s ID and an adoption deed with a fake Government of India seal claiming he got adopted by an Indian woman — under a provision not recognised by Muslim law. Akbar’s claim was denied by the “adoptive mother”.
 
 The revelations were brought to the notice of a Delhi court, which was hearing Akbar’s bail plea. The court dismissed the plea, observing that the man had intended to   the US woman on the false promise of marriage from the very beginning.
 
 “This suggests that the accused was having mens rea from the very beginning and thereafter he extended the false promises of marriage, entered into physical relationship and then drained out the money of the prosecutrix in a well calculated manner which constituted various offences including   and cheating,” said additional sessions judge Rakesh Pandit.
 
 The woman, who has been in India since 2014, became friends with the accused on Facebook. In November 2016, the friendship turned into an affair and it was then that Akbar allegedly showed inclination to marry her. She claimed that Akbar made her sign some documents in order to get their marriage registered in a UAE court. During their subsequent meetings at various hotels in the city, the accused urged her to transfer money (in $) in his account. 
 
 The woman’s lawyer Manoj Taneja told the court that she was duped of $86,000. Taneja also said that on January 16, 2017 the woman got to know that Akbar was a “scammer” and had cheated several single, financially sound women on a similar pretext.
