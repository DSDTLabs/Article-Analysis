BENGALURU: Karnataka’s Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education is far better than the national average, but shoddier compared to the South India average.

 Piloting separate bills to set up the Sri Dharmasthala   in Ujire in Dakshina Kannada, and the   in Kalaburagi, higher education minister Basavaraj Rayareddi said the government has decided to promote private universities in a bid to address this problem.
 
 Reeling out statistics to defend the government’s move, he said the country’s GER in higher education stands at 25% in 2016-17, while Karnataka’s GER is 27%. This, however, is much lower than that of Tamil Nadu’s 47%, Telangana’s 36% and Kerala’s 34%, he added.
 
 GER measures the number of students in the 18-24 age bracket enrolled in higher education programmes — undergraduate, postgraduate and research — and is expressed as a percentage of the population.
 
 He said the new private universities will encourage students to enrol in professional courses or degree colleges after completing II PU by offering quality education.
 
 Welcoming the government’s move,   members said the state government, instead of relying only on private universities, should also look to improve the quality of education and administration in state-run universities to produce employable students.
 
 S   (BJP) said the government is yet to appoint vice-chancellors to nine universities, and over 100 government degree colleges in the state have no principals. “In a first, the governor recently did not attend the   convocation and the university had also failed to bestow gold medals on meritorious students, indicating the poor state of affairs in state universities,’’ he said.
 
 Admitting to the lapses,   said the government has taken measures to set up skill development centres at Dandeli, Koppal and Mysuru to make students employable. He said steps are also being taken to improve the quality of higher education. The bills were finally passed through voice-vote.
