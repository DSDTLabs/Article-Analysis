HYDERABAD: Hyderabad High Court has upheld the life sentence awarded to R Somasekhar of   district, who killed a 16-year-old girl for having spurned his love proposal.

 The girl, Anita of Chagallu in Pedda Pappuru mandal of Anantapur, a first-year intermediate student, refused the love proposal made by 21-year-old Somasekhar in 2007. She had also warned him. So, in a preplanned manner, he stabbed her 20 times and killed her on the spot. A Sessions court in Guthi, Anantapur district, tried the case and awarded him life imprisonment in 2011. The convict preferred an appeal in the high court in 2012.
 
 When the matter came up before the HC three days ago, APâ€™s public prosecutor   told the bench of   T Sunil Chowdary that the convict bore a grudge against the girl and the consequent murder was the result of a plan hatched to kill her. The huge number of stab injuries on the victim shows the extent of grudge nurtured by the convict against the minor girl. The bench upheld the judgement of trial court that awarded life sentence to Somasekhar.
