PUNE: The   has begun hearing   raised by residents regarding the   (DP) for old city areas.

 The process is expected to continue till weekend. The department has received around 2,400 suggestions and objections about the DP. A majority of these pertain to the metro rail route alignment, roads and public amenities.
 
 The state government announced DP for old city areas in January 2017, giving the residents a period of one month — from mid-March to mid-April — for submitting suggestions and objections to the town planning department. Over 1,400 applications were received on the last day. 
 
 Various political parties and activists demanded extending the deadline. The government disproved any extension.
 
 The town planning department officials said that since the applications received were in huge numbers, it took time to scrutinize them all. Once the process was completed, notices were issued to every applicant asking them to remain present on their hearing date. The hearing process has started, but we would need at least a few more days to cater to all the applicants. 
 
 The officials said that the process is expected to get over before Monday.
 
 The town planning department will prepare a comprehensive report based on the hearings and table it to the state government for further consultation. 
 
 The citizens have raised objections about maps in the development plan stating that they lack proper markings of amenity spaces, open spaces, etc. Citizens have voiced concerns over the proposed alignment of the metro rail and areas marked in DP for the metro project.
