GANDHINAGAR:  , Union finance minister and in-charge of Gujarat for the assembly elections, re buked the Gu jarat   for overreacting to the `Vikas Gando Thayo Chhe' jibe that has gone viral. The social media phenomenon mocks Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president  , and the party over the `vikas' (development) claims.While interacting with the party cadre, Jaitley expressed his displeasure over the constant overreaction from chief minister  , deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, Gujarat BJP chief Jitu Vaghani, state party spokesperson  , and other senior leaders.

 The responses of Rupani, Patel, Vaghani have also become viral, with social media mutations making their statements more embarrassing for the BJP and its top brass.These circumstances made Jaitley categorically raise the issue in Tuesday's extended state executive committee meeting. A senior BJP leader who preferred to remain anonymous said: “Arunji advised us not to focus on negative issues like `Vikas Gando Thayo Chhe' campaign and to avoid commenting on it in the media.“ The leader said that Jaitley wants the party in the state to talk about the achievements over the past 22 years in Gujarat, and of PM Modi's successes while leading the   government.
 
 Jaitley also slammed the BJP for suggesting that `Vikas Gando Thayo Chhe' is being promoted by the Congress, and reportedly said: “The Congress does not have the capability to run such an aggressive campaign.“ He apparently feels that the campaign has gone viral because people are responding to the content.
