HYDERABAD: Peeved over not serving them biryani, a group of men, claiming to be followers of RK Puram corporator  , attacked Lucky restaurant owner   at   near   late on Wednesday night. Raza suffered bleeding injuries, while four of the attackers were arrested on Thursday.

 Around 11.45pm, two people entered the hotel and one of them claimed he was the brother of the corporator, the restaurant owner said.
 
 “The shutter of the hotel was closed, but they entered through the rear door. When they asked for biryani, we politely told them the counter was closed. Reacting to it, one of the guys threatened me saying he was the brother of local corporator,” Raza said. However, they insisted that they would not leave without the biryani.
 
 As they refused to budge, the supervisor pushed them out. Within minutes, a group of 10-12 people barged into the hotel, ransacked the place and attacked Raza. RK Puram ward is in the GHMC LB Nagar municipal circle.
