NAGPUR: The act of committing suicide is a trigger, and it usually has a background to it, say experts.

 Psychiatrist   says it represents early childhood experiences of getting demands fulfilled easily. “Several parents show love though material things. They see it as a sign of good parenting, and they keep giving children until the child enters adolescence and starts demanding things like a tab or a bike,” he says.
 
 The child starts comparing itself to others, and peer pressure makes them wonder why the parents are not agreeing now. “Some children also see it as rejection by parents. Parents should, from the beginning, try to develop a need-based demand,” says Gawande. Talking about possible ways to react in such situations, Gawande says that the parents should explain legal barriers such as getting a license to the child, and explain consequences.
 
 Psychiatrist Sudhir Bhave adds that multiple contributing factors lead to such situations, . “Sometimes it is the child’s own temperament where he becomes quite sensitive and is hurt easily. The child may be impulsive, or suffering from depression. Sometimes parents are harsh on the kid, and suicidal tendency also has genetic basis in some cases,” he says. This case also seems to have an undercurrent of   tolerance, he said, adding, “Several times, children are used to getting their demands fulfilled. They are unable to take ‘no’ for an answer.”
 
 Psychologist   emphasizes on the communication gap. “Parents may have got clues earlier about the child’s temperament, and one must ask if they took any efforts to solve it. Computer games also play a role in making them impulsively uncontrollable,” she says adding, that suicide by hanging is a difficult task and checking the child’s frequently visited sites on the Internet can provide clues. In situations when the child makes demands, buy time, she says.
