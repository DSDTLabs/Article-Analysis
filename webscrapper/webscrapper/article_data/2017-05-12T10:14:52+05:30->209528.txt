NEW DELHI: In the four years since   took over the operations of  , it has seen a relatively steady growth in ridership. Fares have been slashed to get more passengers on board and Metro’s push for smart cards has worked well. The average daily   on the airport link is 45,000.

 When   (DMRC) took over the line in 2013, it was a different story altogether. The “high-speed” link — which was re-opened after being shut because of defects in civil structure in January that year — started at 50kmph and was carrying only 9,000 passengers daily.
 
 In August 2016, Airport Express Line crossed the 50,000 ridership figure, a huge jump from the 12,000 in March 2014. The figure was at 19,466 in 2015. According to Delhi Metro, the daily average ridership has now settled between 44,000 and 45,000. 
 
  
  
 To ensure that more people use this line, DMRC revised the fare twice and made several passenger-friendly changes. The maximum fare has been reduced to Rs 60 while the minimum is now Rs 10.
 
 Various other steps like extension of timings to suit passengers of Shatabdi Express trains, improvement of frequency from 15 minutes to 10 minutes 30 seconds, improvement of speed from 70 kmph to 80 kmph, seamless interchange between the Indian Railways station at New Delhi and Metro stations have been taken. 
 
 Metro smart cards were made valid for travel on the line from May 1, 2015. On August 12, 2016, the ridership reached 50,077. The increase in footfall resulted in a rise in both fare and non-fare revenue. “At Shivaji Stadium, most of the space is out on rent. This is because of increased number of people travelling by Airport Express Line,” said a Delhi Metro official.
