RANCHI:   may have quit Test cricket two years back but he is omnipresent at the JSCA International Stadium, which is set to become India's 26th Test venue. As India coach Anil Kumble acknowledged, it was a strange feeling that Dhoni wouldn't be in action in front of his home crowd. After all, what the Wankhede Stadium is to Sachin Tendulkar and Eden Gardens is to Sourav Ganguly, the JSCA International Stadium is to Dhoni.

 “An international match in Ranchi without   will be a bit strange for the people,“ observed Kumble. The for mer le g-spinner, from whom Dhoni had taken over the mantle of leadership in Tests, is aware that the wicketkeeper-batsman is busy shepherding the Jharkhand boys in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Kumble, though, wants India's double World Cupwinning captain to pay them a visit during the Test here.
 
 “I know he is playing for Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, but we hope he comes here on any of the days.It will be a different Indian team (without him), but I hope people will turn up and support us. It is going to be a his torical moment for Jharkhand cricket and any venue hosting its first ever Test match is always special,“ said Kumble.
 
 From hosting its first international match in January 2013, when India faced England in the third ODI of the five-match series, the JSCA International Stadium has come a long way to be upgraded as a Test venue. While India won the maiden international game at this venue, with   producing an unbeaten 77 four years ago,  's sole outing here yielded no result owing to a washout when India began chasing 296 in another ODI.
 
 It's been a happy hunting ground for the Men in Blue, who have won three of the four ODIs they have played here.The city also hosted a T20 International last year, when the Dhoni-led Indians beat Sri Lanka by 69 runs to draw level in the three-match series.
