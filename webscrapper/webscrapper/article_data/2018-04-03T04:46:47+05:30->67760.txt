MUMBAI: The   has issued a circular stating that warehouse construction will henceforth not require a fire  . The move surprised the real estate observers, who said very few warehouses are constructed in the city. 

 In 2015 the state government waived development charges to the extent of 90% for warehouse construction, said architect  . "There are more housing and commercial buildings that are constructed in the city but have not been given a similar concession," he said. 
 
 Chief fire officer P   said rules had been issued for the architect and the land owner. "This is only for a small plot less than 900 sq m for a ground-plus-one storey structure. This self-certification is only at the initial stages when plans are submitted online," he said.
 
 The scrutiny of the plans will now be done using a software which will give the NOC as long as the plan is i naccordance with the Development Control Regulations. The inspection for compliance before issuing occupation certificate will be physically done by a fire officer, said Rahangdhale. The fire NOC normally takes seven days and this will now be cut out completely.
 
 Sources said the move was aimed at improving the country's ranking in the  's ease of doing business. Last year India jumped 30 positions to become the top 100th country in ease of business.
