GHAZIABAD: A 27-year-old man allegedly killed his   at his flat in   in the early hours of Friday and then surrendered to police. Pankaj Joshi told cops that he strangled 45-year-old Renu Singh with a dupatta in a fit of anger as she had been pressurising him to sever ties with his parents.

 Pankaj, who owns an eatery in  , befriended Renu, originally from Mumbai, on   some two months ago and they started living together in Ghaziabad a month back. 
 
 She was married and had four children.
 
 Police said Pankaj murdered Renu around 3 am after an argument broke out between them and went to Khoda police station around 11.30 pm, where he confessed to his crime in front of inspector O P Singh. 
 
 He claimed Renu had started blackmailing him of late and even threatened to file a sexual harassment case against him if he did not cut ties with his parents.
 
 Police officers soon reached Pankaj’s rented accommodation and sent the body for an autopsy. 
 
 The woman’s husband Radhe Mohan has also been informed about her death.
 
 SP (city) Akash Tomar said, “Pankaj and Renu had come in contact with each other through Facebook and eventually became close friends. In the past also, Renu used to come from Mumbai to meet Pankaj and go back after spending a few days with him. However, they used to frequently fight with each other over one issue or the other. They had a fight early on Friday, and then Joshi in a fit of rage killed her.”
 
 Pankaj has been arrested and booked under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. He will be produced in a court on Saturday.
 
 Circle officer (Indirapuram) Dharmendra Singh Chauhan said, “Joshi is originally from Betalghat in Nainital. He has been living here alone for the past six months and running an eatery in Nehru Garden. Joshi’s brother-in-law also lives in Khoda, while his parents are living in Betalghat. We will have more information about Renu’s background after her husband arrives here on Saturday.”
