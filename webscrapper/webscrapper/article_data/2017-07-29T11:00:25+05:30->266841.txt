MOHALI: The parks in Mohali have turned into   following few hours of rainfall on Thursday. Just few hours of rains have exposed the lack of preparedness of the Mohali municipal corporation to tackle the water logging menace.

 Ankle deep water could be seen in many places where the road gullies were blocked and had low laying areas. The Mango Park in Phase III, Industrial Area, green belt in Phase V, Community Park in Phase XI and parking lot opposite Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) building were some of the places where water ponds were seen.
 
 Residents of the affected areas complained of facing the problem every year with no action being taken from the municipal corporation’s (MC) side. 
 
 The officials of both the bodies, MC and GMADA claimed that they have performed their duties of clearing the blockage but the problem persists.
 
 Public is of the view that MC officials have not been paying heed the civic problems in the city.  , resident of Phase VI said, “The parks in Mohali become virtual water pools and remain of no use for days. Children are forced to keep away from playing in parks as the parks pose danger.”
