JAISALMER: Yet another foreigner, this time from  , was injured after being hit by a stay cow near the  .

 On Thursday, Malisha, who is in her early twenties and from England, was hit by a cow when she was returning after visiting the Sonar Fort. She suffered injuries on her nose and bruised her legs and elbows. ``I was really scared and shocked. I could even get myself to get up from the road after the fall but locals helped me and rushed me to the hospital,’’ she said.
 
 The problem of stray cattle is alarmingly rising and yet, the administration is yet to act and initiate measures to deal with the growing menace. In the last six months alone, there have been at least six cases of foreign tourists being hit by stay cattle in Jaisalmer alone. On November 25, a   national had to be airlifted after he broke his leg after being hit by a bull.
 
 The problem, though, is not restricted to Jaisalmer. In Jaipur, a 29-year-old Argentine man was killed after being hit by a stray bull in the walled city area on November 18, 2017. 
 
 The rise in such incidents have upset not just the tourists but also the locals. Whenever such an incidet happens, the local administration launches a drive to catch the stray cattle, however, that is only an eyewash. Stray cattle roaming in city is a common sight especially at tourist spots like Sonar Fort, Patwa Haveli etc.
 
 Jitendra Singh Rathore, president of Jaisalmer Paryatan Vyavasai Mahasangh, association of those involved with tourism, said it is a very shameful incident for the tourist city. ``Lakhs of tourists come here and such incidents leave a bad image of the city in their minds. On any given day, there are so many   on the streets and they cause trouble for locals and for tourists. We have repeatedly approached the local administration to find a permanent solution but nothing has been done so far,’’ said Rathore.
