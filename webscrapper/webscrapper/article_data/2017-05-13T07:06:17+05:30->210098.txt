His body has been kept at Lehra Bega.
 
 Jaswant’s son Gurdeep Singh alleged, “Patwari Jagjit and his associate   had provided the compensation meant for our family against the land acquired by the government to one Raj Singh by forging papers. Due to that my father committed suicide and named the three in his suicide note. We want the three should be arrested by Saturday or we will start major protest.”
 
 Bathinda deputy commissioner Diprava Lakra said, “Police have been directed to arrest the patwari and his accomplices by Saturday morning so that the family of Jaswant could be prevailed upon to cremate his body.”
