GUWAHATI: The   (APW), a rights body in the state, slammed leader of the anti-talks Ulfa (I) Paresh Baruah for becoming a "puppet" in China's hands. It claimed that the outfit, that opposed the Dalai Lama's visit to the state, may try to create trouble in the government's project of dredging the Brahmaputra. 

 On April 4, the Centre had signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government to dredge the Brahmaputra and construct a national expressway on its bank. Altogether 841km of the Brahmaputra will be dredged from Sadiya to Dhubri and the sand will be used to construct the 1,300-km   on the river bank. Experts said the project would also endorse India's rights over the river.
 
 APW president Abhijeet Sharma said, "The Brahmaputra dredging project has upset the Chinese authorities who try to assert their rights over the river that flows down from Tibet. Paresh Baruah, being a Chinese agent, may try to lead a proxy war in the state in a bid to create hindrance in the project."
 
 The rights body claimed that it has information that the neighbouring country has planned to send a diplomatic team under the leadership of  , Chinese ambassador to India, to Tinsukia district in Assam. "We have reason to believe that the planned visit by Chinese delegation might be part of a conspiracy to access and survey the dredging project. APW demands the Centre and state government to clarify its stand and make it public whether a Chinese delegation is visiting the state or not?" Sharma said. The APW demanded that the Centre not grant permission to any visit by the Chinese delegation to the state.
 
 Ranjan Chakravartty, deputy commissioner of Tinsukia district, however, told TOI, "No official confirmation of the delegation's visit has been received yet."
