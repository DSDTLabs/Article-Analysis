CHENNAI: Wildlife officials in the city have started clearing Prosopis juliflora ( ), an exotic invasive species, from the   (GNP), despite a stay issued by the Madras high court on clearing the species.

 A senior wildlife official said nearly 6,000sqft inside the GNP and bordering the IIT-Madras campus has been infested with the invasive species which is not allowing native trees and other shrubs to grow.
 
 Last year, the invasive trees were not uprooted, only their trunks chopped off. This year they are being uprooted to provide a larger feeding area to herbivores, especially the spotted deer and blackbuck.
 
 Officials said the work began five days ago and already around 300 trees have been cleared. When TOI visited GNP on Wednesday, it found an earthmover bringing down the trees which were then cleared from the premises.
 
 However, T Murugavel, founder of Chennai-based conservation group  , said removal of the prosopis trees is ill-timed. “The day time temperature is going up every day. If the trees are cleared now, the herbivores will get exposed to direct sunlight and its heat. This will affect the health of the blackbuck and spotted deer,” he said. 
 
 Another conservationist said the high court had stayed the clearing of prosopis trees from the state a couple of months ago. The order had said wherever the trees posed a problem, they could be removed, otherwise there was no need to clear them, he said. The stay was issued following a request from the forest department which said clearing the tree cover would have a negative impact, the conservationist said.
 
 Despite multiple efforts by TOI to reach   warden  , the official did not respond.
