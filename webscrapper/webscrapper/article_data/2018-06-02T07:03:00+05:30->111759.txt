GHAZIABAD: A delay in identifying   for setting a plant to treat   to be supplied to households in Raj Nagar Extension has cast a cloud of uncertainty on when the project would be complete.

 Officials in UP Jal Nigam said they had written at least three letters to   Municipal Corporation and   to make land available for project but the missives have not elicited any response.
 
 The officials said that only after land is identified, they can prepare a detailed project report and lay down the deadline for its completion. “Last month, we had presented a feasibility report to GMC mentioning a tentative cost for implementing the project. It was estimated at around Rs 820 crore,” said GP  , chief engineer in the Jal Nigam. “As for land, we had specifically spelt out the need for three acres for the plant and some additional land for laying pipelines from Murad Nagar to Raj Nagar Extension, where we propose to set up the treatment plant,” he added.
 
 But Shukla claimed that even after three letters to the two bodies, there had been no response from either of them. “This inordinate delay on the part of   and GMC will have a bearing on the completion of the project. Unless we get land, we cannot prepare the detailed project report, which needs to be vetted by the state government,” Shukla said.
 
 The chief engineer said it would take at least two years to implement the project. Municipal commissioner CP Singh said there was no dearth of land, adding they planned to start the process of identifying it in a meeting of corporation board. “The GMC board meeting is scheduled for Saturday. We can then initiate process of handing over the land to Jal Nigam,” said Singh.
 
 The supply of Ganga water is limited to trans-Hindon areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara and in delta colonies like Surya Nagar. There has been a persistent demand from residents to extend the Ganga water supply to Raj Nagar Extension, Madhuban-Bapudham and Mohan Nagar.
