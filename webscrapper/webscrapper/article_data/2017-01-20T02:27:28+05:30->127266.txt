NEW DELHI: A PIL in the   on Thursday questioned the validity of the government re-promulgating the   for the fifth time and called it a clear violation of the recent order by a constitution bench of the apex court. 

 "The action of the government in re-promulgating the ordinance, bypassing the legislative process of  , is not only arbitrary and in breach of Article 14 of the Constitution but also a fraud on the Constitution itself," petitioner   said.
 
 The Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 2016, was promulgated by the President on January 7, 2016 to amend the Enemy Property Act, 1968, and the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971. A bill on the same lines was passed in   on March 9, 2016. The next day, it was laid before  , which referred it to a select committee on March 15. A day later, Parliament was adjourned. 
 
 The ordinance was re-promulgated on April 2 last year. Parliament met again but no legislative action was taken. However, it was promulgated for the third time on May 31, 2016. The process continued and it was re-promulgated for the fifth time on December 22 last year and the government did not even specify what was the grave urgency for its re-promulgation.
 
 The petitioner cited the January 2 judgment in Krishna Kumar Singh case by the constitution bench of the SC, which said, "Re-promulgation of ordinances is constitutionally impermissible since it represents an effort to overreach the legislative body which is the primary source of lawmaking authority in a parliamentary democracy.
 
 "Re-promulgation defeats the constitutional scheme under which a limited power to frame ordinances has been conferred upon the President and governors.
