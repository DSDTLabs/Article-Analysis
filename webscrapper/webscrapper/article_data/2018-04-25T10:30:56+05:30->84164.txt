CHANDIGARH: S  , principal secretary, NRI Affairs, Punjab, released his book 'Kyon Khaunf kolo dar de ne log?' at   here on Tuesday. The book offers a deep insight into Ambedkar's personality, his contributions to the society and his differences with Mahatma Gandhi. 

 Ladhar remarked that women empowerment was Ambedkar's biggest contribution to the society. He said "Unfortunately, Ambedkar has been reduced to being the Messiah of the backward castes. He had proposed Hindu Code Bill which imposed monogamy on Hindus. The bill also gave the women the right to divorce and property rights."
 
 KC Sulekh, the author of books on Ambedkar and Buddhism, sought to persuade the audience to transform their 'Bhima-Bhakti' to 'Bhima-Shakti' to end the cycle of revolution and counter-revolution. "After suffering for centuries, we finally revolted on the guided path by Babasaheb. Now, the Supreme Court has diluted the SC/ST Act. That's counter-revolution. We must act to protect the constitution," the 91-year-old said.
 
 He was speaking at a seminar on 'Ambedkarism' organised on the eve of B R Ambedkar's 127th birth anniversary at university's Golden Jubilee hall. Sulekh, who held the post of Punjab secretary during Ambedkar's visit to the state, narrated the social thinker's views on students in politics. Ambedkar held the view that students should gain academic knowledge to understand the complex political world, said Sulekh.
 
 In his keynote address, Ajit Chahal, assistant professor, department of laws, Kurukshetra University, described 'heaven and hell' as physical realities than being religious notions. He said "An egalitarian society is a heaven. A society where a section is oppressed is hell." He emphasized on Ambedkar's stance of establishing a casteless and creedless Indian society for the nation to become a global superpower. Chahal reiterated that as Ambedkar's philosophy of life.
