Patiala: The cop, who allegedly misbehaved with an amritdhari Sikh girl in a bus, was arrested on Tuesday by Dirba police of Sangrur. Assistant sub-inspector Didar Singh of Government Railway Police (GRP) was booked on Monday for outraging the modesty of a woman and hurting religious sentiments.

 Sangrur senior superintendent of police (SSP) M S Sidhu said after conducting a preliminary inquiry, a case under relevant sections was registered against Didar at the Dirba police station and he was arrested subsequently.
 
 ASI Didar, who was reportedly drunk, had misbehaved with the Sikh girl while they were travelling from Sangrur to Patran in Patiala district on July 21. The accused asked her why she was wearing the kirpan. He allegedly told the girl they generally got the kirpans and kachhehras (worn by baptised Sikhs) removed in the police stations. He allegedly held the girlâ€™s hand and forced her to sit along with him.
 
 While some of the bus passengers objected to the offending behaviour of the policeman, one Jaswinder Singh, who had reportedly got into a scuffle with Didar in the bus, had later thrashed him in full public view after they got down at the Patran bus stand on Friday.
 
 Videos recorded by some bystanders at the Patran bus stand and on board the PRTC bus had gone viral on the social media.
 
 The issue was even raised by Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh who issued a statement on Monday demanding strict action against the accused. Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Kirpal Singh Badungar had also expressed concern and offered legal help to the girl with whom the ASI had misbehaved.
