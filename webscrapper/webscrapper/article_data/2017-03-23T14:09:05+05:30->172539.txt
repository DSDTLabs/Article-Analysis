PATNA: The 125-year-old   is planning to preserve and conserve the old manuscripts and books from termites and bugs through anoxicator, which is a low-oxygen eco-safe pest treatment system. The library has about 21,000 oriental manuscripts and 2.5 lakh printed books.

 Sources in the library said an expert team from   of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) briefed about the technique and use of the machine during a workshop organized at the library premises on Monday to preserve the old manuscripts and books.
 
 Director of Odisha chapter of INTACH, Mallika Mitra, said with moderate infestations, the use of low toxic formulations that have been developed to kill pests on contact and also leave residual protection will save the valuable documents for generations to come. “Treatment of the immediate environment within and outside the structure may also be needed in certain cases. Anoxicator machine is designed specifically to treat valuable materials such as artefacts, manuscripts and books in museums and libraries. It creates a low-oxygen environment, killing the insect pests at all stages of their development,” she said.
 
 “There are thousands of important manuscripts and books and they need to be preserved and conserved using scientific techniques,” said Mitra. According to her, the entire process can be broadly classified into two parts: preservation and conservation. 
 
 “It is eco-friendly for sensitive materials such as textiles, paper, paintings, ivory and wooden artefacts. It ensures a complete protection from topical airborne microbes,” she said. The cost of an anoxicator machine is around Rs20-22 lakh.
 
 Library official   said the authorities would take the decision of purchasing the machine after a meeting. “The machine is costly but effective and easy to handle. It is one-time expenditure to preserve and conserve the old manuscripts and books,” he added.
