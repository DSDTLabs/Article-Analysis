JAIPUR:   actor   has shot off a letter on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( ), India, calling on Rajasthan minister for forest and environment, Gajendra Singh Khimsar to relocate an elephant, known only as "number 44", to a rehabilitation facility for urgent care after a group of American tourists witnessed eight men violently beating her at the Amber Fort. 

 "It has been three years since an inspection team authorized by the   documented rampant and widespread abuse of elephants used for rides in Jaipur, including at Amber Fort. I respectfully request that you start with number 44, who should be confiscated and sent to a rehabilitation facility for treatment and care. This animal deserves to live without chains and in the company of other elephants."
 
 Sinha's letter follows PETA India's complaint to the Chief Wildlife Warden, Rajasthan, which resulted in a show-cause notice issued to number 44's custodian  , holding him responsible for the abuse. The notice stated that an investigation carried out by the regional forest officer for Jaipur Zoo, as well as a photograph supplied by the American witness, indicated that the elephant was treated cruelly, in apparent violation of numerous animal-protection laws. Following that the Jaipur police also registered a FIR against unidentified men under Sections 429 and 289 of the Indian Penal Code for ill-treating the elephant and putting public safety at risk. However, despite that Khan was later allowed to use her for rides.
 
 PETA India notes that captive elephants, such as the ones forced to give rides in Jaipur, often are beaten mercilessly, are denied adequate food and veterinary care, and suffer from foot problems and arthritis because of long periods spent standing on hard surfaces. 
 
 Many develop neurotic forms of behaviour and die prematurely.
