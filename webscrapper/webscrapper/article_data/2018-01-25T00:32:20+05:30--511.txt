 Jain added, "Protesting voices are being raised but we are all happy that a person from our town wrote such a tremendous piece of literature that is also taught in schools. We hope that the filmmakers will spend a share of the profits they earn on restoring Malik Muhammad Jaisi's dilapidated home in Kanchana locality."
