CHENNAI: In a bizarre incident, a 24-year-old bit off a police constable’s finger on Sunday in Koyambedu while trying to resist arrest for snatching a bag.

 Police said N Jagadeesh, 17, arrived from Coimbatore and was waiting for a cab at Koyambedu on Sunday evening. He was bound for his home in Kolathur when the incident took place. At 5pm, when Jagadeesh was engrossed in his phone, M Iyyappan, snatched his bag and fled. Jagadeesh immediately raised an alarm. Passersby and autorickshaw drivers at the spot tried to get hold of the accused but the man tried to make good his escape. It was constable S Karthik, 28, from the Koyambedu police station who managed to intercept the accused.
 
 As a few of them began raining blows on Iyyappan, Karthik rescued him. The constable held the suspect by his collar and was on the way to the police station when the Iyyappan suddenly removed the constable’s hand, overpowered him and bit the tip of his ring finger on the right hand. “He bit hard until it severed, even as the police constable cried out for help,” said an investigating officer.
 
 When Iyyappan tried to escape again, the injured constable chased him, passersby caught hold of him. This time he was beaten up and handed over to Koyambedu CMBT police station. The bag was handed over to Jagadeesh. Karthik was rushed to a private hospital at Anna Nagar where he was given sutures for the injury. 
 
 Police said Iyyappan was a previous offender who has been involved in theft cases and pick pockets at Koyambedu market and Tirumangalam.
