HYDERABAD: On a cold Friday night in Washington DC,   asked: “Why don’t we belong here?” This question was first posed by  , wife of engineer   who was shot dead in a  , Kansas on Feb 22. The query, which captured the sense of fear felt after the alleged hate crime, was reiterated as nearly a hundred people gathered at   near the White House in the US capital for a candlelight vigil in memory of Srinivas.

 “People should understand who were are and what are culture is. We will explain it to them. They should tell us why we don’t belong here,” Abhibha said, adding: “We are not able to tell people who we are. If we are able to do this, we will find acceptance.” 
 
 Organised by The World Hindu Council of America, the vigil saw people of different faiths speak about the need to stay united in an increasingly divided world. “Hate has no place here. This city is your city. It belongs to all of us. Our community should stand together,” said Thomas L. Bowen, director of the Office of Religious Affairs in the executive office of the Mayor of Olathe. 
 
 “Both Hindus of Indian origin, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and   were targeted by Purinton, who later justified his heinous act by claiming that he was targeting Iranian Muslims, as if that would somehow absolve him of the barbarity of the crime,” a representative of the Council said.
 
 Speakers at the meet expressed concern about the racial attacks, but said people should continue to pursue the American dream. “It was blind hate and bigotry that Srinivas fell victim to,” a speaker said.
