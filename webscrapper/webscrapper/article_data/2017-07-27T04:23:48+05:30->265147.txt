 On July 23 morning, undertrials David Devendram (25) and Manikant Nadar (24), who have over 40 cases of rioting, assault, theft and robbery registered against them at various police stations, yanked off the cable wires of a CCTV camera on the jail premises and used it as a rope to scale the jail wall and escape. 
 
 “Instructions have been issued to all jail authorities to check CCTV camera cables wires and remove those that are unncessary,” said a jail officer. “Electricians will be asked to rearrange the cable wires to avoid such jailbreaks. Also, all jails have been asked to beef up security near the boundary walls and increase patrolling at night and morning when the barracks open. We have sought more personnel for jails in the state as there is a severe staff crunch.”
 
 After escaping from jail, the duo crossed Kalyan creek, assaulted a biker, who had halted to attend to a phone call, and fled on his bike. The biker told the police that one of the runaway convicts has injuries on the face.
 
 Dombivli resident Devendram was arrested in 2014, and Nadar, a Mumbra resident, was behind bars since 2015.
