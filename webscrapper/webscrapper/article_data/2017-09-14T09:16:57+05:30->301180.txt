SIRSA: Twenty-two days after curfew was imposed in three villages around the headquarters of   in   on August 24, the district administration finally lifted the restrictions on Wednesday. 

 With this, the entire area came back to life and children could be seen heading for school in the morning. Sirsa sub-divisional magistrate (SDM)   said said they lifted the curfew in the morning and police barriers had been removed. “People can move in or out of the dera and there are no restrictions. As far as the administration is concerned, the media can also go inside the dera,” he said.
 
 Ahead of the August 25 conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda chief  , curfew had been imposed in the entire Sirsa district. While the restrictions had been lifted in most parts of the district, they were still in force in villages around the dera headquarters. 
 
 Life had come to a standstill in the three villages where curfew had been imposed all this time — Nejia, Begu, and Bajekan. Villagers had to stay in their homes and schools were also closed. Parents of students had even met Sirsa deputy commissioner (DC) Prabhjot Singh to seek relaxation for schools inside the dera and in villages. “We felt relaxed today. Children went to school, while all shops were opened and villagers bought all necessary items. We faced many odds during the curfew. Police and security forces had set up barriers to block any movement. Farmers and labourers have heaved a sigh of relief,” said   sarpanch Chandra Bhan.
