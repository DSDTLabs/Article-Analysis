PANAJI: The   ( ) and hospital will shortly float a tender to select a party to operate its canteens. The tender conditions have been finalised, and it's likely to be out shortly. For the first time, the government-run hospital will have a dietitian attached to the canteen so that patients are prescribed a diet as per their requirement. 

  One canteen will offer cater to visitors and staff and will have Goan food - fish, curry, rice - on the menu, said a senior GMC official. "There will be special diet meals for patients," said the officer. 
 
 The responsibility of upgrading the hospital's canteens will rest with the contractor. Not only are GMC's canteens in poor shape, the meals offered by them are not great either. A few months ago, Foods   (FDA) had sealed all three of the premier hospital's canteens due to poor hygiene. The canteens were unsealed only after defects pointed out by the   were rectified. 
 
 A GMC staffer said that even though the canteens have been mended and things have improved a little in terms of hygiene, the menu has not been changed.
 
 "It is only when we run short of time that we eat at the hospital canteen," said a group of GMC students.
 
 Another GMC staffer said,"I prefer to go outside the GMC campus to eat fish, curry and rice, rather than eat the drab meal offered at the hospital canteen."
 
 Most staff, he said, eat at the small stalls outside the hospital, but since it is not always possible to make time to go there, many are compelled to eat at the canteen.
 
 "It is a high time that the government changed the contractors, so that the staff, patients and visitors have access to quality food," the staffer added.
