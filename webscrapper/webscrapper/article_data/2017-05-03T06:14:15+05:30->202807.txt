LUCKNOW: After the photograph of UP   chairperson with a   cautioning ‘waqf usurpers’ went  , the Shia Ulema Committee came forth condemning the photo as an open mockery of the UP government on Tuesday. 

 The chairperson, Waseem Rizvi, had posted the photo on his personal social media account with the caption that read, “Wait only for a few days, grave and waqf land usurpers be alert, I am still on duty.”
 
 The act has not gone down well with a section of Shia clerics in the city. In addition, Rizvi had also stated to people on his social media friend list to not be scared as the skull in his hand was only a   one. 
 
 Calling it a ‘crazy act’, the Shia Ulema committee said the post was a bad reaction to the state government’s steps towards an inquiry into alleged corruption in the Board. The committee further claimed that with the skull in possession, the chairperson is trying to scare those who have led the waqf movement. 
 
 “It now seems he wants to get into black magic. He is making fun of the state and central governments which are going to deal strictly with waqf mafia. He is trying to instil fear in people involved with the movement,” said the committee. 
 
 Rizvi, on the other hand, claimed that the post was on his personal account and not an official one and should not be made into an issue. 
 
 “All the more, my message was to those who are guilty of taking waqf land illegally. I see no problem the general public might have with that,” he said. Calling it a ‘plastic toy’ like any other toy, Rizvi said, “Why must one be scared of a plastic toy?”
