LUCKNOW: Ending days of speculations, the state government on Sunday appointed senior   Om Prakash   as the state's new director general of police. 

 The appointment of 1983 batch IPS officer was finalised just on the day outgoing DGP Sulkhan Singh retired after three months' extension.
 
 OP Singh, currently posted as DG, Central Industrial Security Forces, is fifth in the hierarchy of UP cadre's IPS officers after Pravin Kumar Singh, Surya Kumar Shukla, Rajiv Rai Bhatnagar and Gopal Gupta. 
 
 
 
 
 Because Singh is fifth in the hierarchy of UP cadre’s IPS officers, his name was not on the list of contenders after it became apparent that Sulkhan Singh was not going to get another extension.
 
 Insiders, however, say what seems to have gone in his favour is the long tenure — till 2019-end — he will get to implement police reforms as desired by chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi. Clearly, the main challenge before him would be implementation of UPCOCA, organising 2019 Kumbh and holding general elections. OP Singh had earned praises as DG of the National Disaster Response Force when he led the operations in Kashmir floods two years back and in the aftermath of harshest earthquake in Nepal. In his initial years as SP in Kheri and other terai districts, Singh was appreciated for the anti-terrorist operations in the mid-80s. However, the infamous state guest house incident of June 1995 in which BSP chief Mayawati had alleged that SP workers tried to kill her after her party pulled out of coalition government, remains a forgettable chapter in his otherwise bright career.
 
 He was Lucknow SSP at that time and the city police under him faced charges of being silent spectators when the alleged murderous attack took place.
 
 Singh is taking over at a time when the IPS cadre stands bruised following the controversy over IAS lobby attempt to take crime control in districts in its own hand.
