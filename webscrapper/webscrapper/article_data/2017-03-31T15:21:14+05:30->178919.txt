Shortly before his contract with   was up for renewal,   walked out of the show last weekend, following a widely publicized altercation with show-runner Kapil on board an Australia-India flight when the latter, allegedly in an inebriated state, threw a shoe at Sunil and verbally abused the team. Comedians Raju Shrivastav, Ehsaan Qureshi and Sunil Pal were roped in as guest performers for the show’s first episode after Sunil’s exit. Kapil was not his usual jovial self and distinctly uncomfortable during that one-hour appearance.
 
  A source told Mirror that Sunil has decided never to return to the show despite having contributed to its popularity with his two avatars,   and Rinku Bhabhi. Now, we have learnt that Sunil will be reviving both the quirky characters on another show on the same channel. He returns as Dr Gulati and   in the finale of the singing reality show,  , this weekend.
  
  
 
  
  A source from the sets reveals, “On Wednesday, Sunil was rehearsing his act at a city studio. Kapil was shooting for his show close by. The two did not interact. Sunil will shoot for Indian Idol on Friday and then again on Sunday, when the episode is slated to be aired. The other integration planned for the finale is with Vishal Vashishtha and Madirakshi Mundle from the daily soap Jaat Ki Jugni.”
  
  A source close to Sunil adds, “The channel was to renew Sunil’s contract in the next few weeks but that’s unlikely now. He has told friends that he is missing The   Show but can’t go back after all the humiliation. He hasn’t decided his next move.
