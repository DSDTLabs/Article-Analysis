VV Vinayak is back after directing  , with Inttelligent. There’s been a considerable buzz around the release of this film, considering Vinayak is now teaming up with Chiru’s nephew  , who’s looking to turn his career around after a string of flops. But   is no different from the usual run-of-the-mill entertainers that Tollywood churns out with alarming regularity. 

 
 
 The film tells the story of Teja (Sai Dharam Tej) who aspires to be a software engineer ever since he’s a child, just so that he could work closely with his mentor   (Nasser) . A gold medallist student, Teja becomes Nanda Kishore’s right hand man and together they run a company that helps those in need and serves the poor. However, a dreaded mafia don Vicky Bhai (Rahul Dev) and his gang of goons have their eye on the software company (having already acquired acres of land and money from innocent people). When Nanda Kishore resists the mafia, there are severe consequences. How Teja transforms from a good employee into a man on a mission - to save his mentor’s company and take his revenge against th the mafia, makes for the rest of the film.
 
 
 
 The first half is a mix of entertaining humour and nonsensical narration. While some of the comic scenes do leave you in splits, the disruption in the flow of narration is both inexplicable and bizarre. The much-hyped ‘Chamak chamak cham’ song, for instance, comes from nowhere. There are also manufactured fight sequences and fake romance. One hopes that the second half would be more purposeful.
