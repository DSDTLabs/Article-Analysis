PATNA: Such was the crowd at   on Wednesday that the administration had to restrict entry of non-Sikh visitors in the evening to avoid any untoward incident. 

 Patna DM   said at least 3 lakh people visited   on Wednesday. “The footfall was so huge that it became difficult to control people. To avoid any stampede-like situation, we had to restrict the entry of non-Sikh visitors. They weill, however, be allowed to enter the makeshift gurdwara once the rush eases,” the DM added.
 
 “Many people had this wrong notion that today was the last day for  . They should know that the celebrations will continue till January 6. The non-Sikh people should postpone their visit to Gandhi Maidan for the convenience of large number of Sikh devotees who have come here from across the country and abroad,” the DM said.
 
 He added that 12 trains and 200 buses reached Patna from Punjab on Wednesday. “Devotees would be provided entry through gate numbers 5, 7 and 10. Gate number 1 is restricted for VVIPs only. Common people can use other gates,” he said.
 
 Asked about crowd management at Gandhi Maidan on Thursday when Prime Minister   and other dignitaries are expected to arrive, Agarwal said, “Not more than 70,000 people would be allowed entry inside Gandhi Maidan on Thursday.” 
 
 The district administration’s move to close gates for non-Sikh people, however, irked the commoners. One Sharbendu Kumar, a schoolteacher, said despite coming here all the way from Ara with three of his friends, he could not enter Gandhi Maidan to enjoy the celebrations.
 
 Soni Kumari, a resident of Postal Park, said she could not enter Gandhi Maidan despite standing in queue for three hours.
