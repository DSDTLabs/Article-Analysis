PATNA: The head of Takht Sri Harmandir Ji managing committee at   on Tuesday said he will put in his papers on Friday, a day after Prakashotsav celebrations are over in the city.

 Makkar, also the outgoing president of  , however, did not give any specific reason for his decision to step down as Takht Patna Sahib head. His tenure was to end six months later.
 
 Talking to TOI at   on Tuesday, Makkar said, “I have done my job by organizing the 350th Prakashotsav. I am no more interested in the post. Let people from Patna be at the helm.” Makkar, who lives in Ludhiana, used to come to Patna often after assuming charge as president of Patna Sahib Prabandhak Committee.
 
 None of the prabandhak committee members TOI spoke to were aware of Makkar’s decision to quit. “It is surprising. We had not expected this. He was elected about two years ago and we expected him to complete full term,” a senior member of the committee told TOI on the condition of anonymity.
 
 Makkar’s term as president of Takht Sahib committee was marred with controversies. About a month ago, the factionalism within committee came to the fore with a few members alleging bungling of funds by some of their colleagues.
 
 At that time, Makkar, while talking to TOI, had admitted financial mismanagement, but said he was unaware of most of the businesses done by the prabandhak committee. “I don’t live in Patna,” he had said, adding that a meeting of the committee would be held on January 15 to look into the funds bungling charge.
