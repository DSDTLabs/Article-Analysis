THANE: A 22-year-old man from Ghansoli in Navi Mumbai, who was accused of outraging the modesty of a schoolgirl in 2014, was acquitted by the district   after the girl deposed in court that he had been framed by her family.

 District judge Ashutosh N Karmarkar acquitted Prashant Kamble of all charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Police had booked Kamble in September 2014 following a complaint that he would follow the   every day to school and make catcalls and inappropriate gestures. 
 
 Cross-examination of the teenager in court revealed discrepancies in her statement to police and her   in the court. The teenager admitted that she had a ‘soft corner’ for the youth but her parents were opposed to him. She also told the court that he had neither molested nor troubled her. Based on her deposition, the court set him free.
