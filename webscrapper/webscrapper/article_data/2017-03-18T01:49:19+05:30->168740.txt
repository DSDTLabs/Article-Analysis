MUMBAI: Questioning why   is being wasted for providing   to   and   persons, the   on Friday slammed the state government for failing to recover dues from them.

 A bench headed by the chief justice, hearing a public interest litigation on non-recovery of police protection dues, perused a list of persons given police cover across Maharashtra.
 
 The judges said it appears police cover is being provided to some people only because they have affiliation to certain political parties. “Why tax-payer’s money is to be spent on former members of the legislature and their relatives? Let them or their political parties take care of them and their relatives. Why should public money be wasted on providing them police protection? It can’t be that their burden is shifted on the state exchequer,” they added.
 
 The list showed that 1,032 people, including 242 from Mumbai, have been provided police protection across the state and four policemen on average are deployed for protection duties per person. The list also includes 482 persons other than constitutional functionaries like elected representatives, bureaucrats and judges of the high court and lower courts. 
 
 The government’s advocate Abhinandan Vagyani informed that Rs 15 crore was recovered of the total outstanding dues of Rs 21 crore in Mumbai. Another Rs 7 crore is outstanding from individuals in other parts of Maharashtra. Vagyani also said a quarterly review is taken. “We always see the threat perception,’’ he added. The judges said while they were not experts but questioned why private persons like builders and businessmen were being provided free cover when they can easily afford to pay. “You have categories under which some people are paying and others are not. This reflects complete non-application of mind. If the government wants to do charity, then tell us directly,” they added. 
 
 Adjourning the hearing, the bench felt there is a need to review the entire list, including certain non-payment categories.
