Trichy: Trichy city police arrested three people for illegally mining sand from   river bed and seized their bullock carts in Trichy on Friday. One person escaped during the raid conducted by the village administrative officer (VAO), Kumaravel. 

 The Ariyamangalam police nabbed A Arockiaraj, 48, R Pugazhselvan, 35 and T Albert, 28, all from the same area for indulging in illegal sand mining activity near   in the early hours on Friday.
 
 According to a complaint by the VAO, he found three persons taking sand from the river bed and loading them on bullock carts at an hour’s interval. Kumaravel informed the Ariyamangalam police about the illegal activity. The police rounded them up and caught them. The police also seized three bullock carts loaded with one unit of sand each.
 
 They were booked under section 379 read with Tamil Nadu mines and minerals (development and regulation) Act. All of them were produced in the court and remanded in judicial custody.
 
 In another incident, the VAO found a mini truck loaded with river sand near   in Trichy city. On seeing the officer, the driver of the vehicle fled the scene on Friday morning. Based on a complaint from the officer, fort police confiscated the vehicle with ¾ unit of sand.
 
 Illegal sand mining remained uncontrolled in Trichy despite the ban on the sand quarrying in Cauvery and   rivers by the Madras high court for nearly one year here. People involved in sand mining by bullock carts insist on granting permission to take sand to save their livelihood. It may be recalled that there were instances of sand being stolen by trucks in the rural parts of the district few months ago.
