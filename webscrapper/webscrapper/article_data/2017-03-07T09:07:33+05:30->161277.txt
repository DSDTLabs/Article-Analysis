VARANASI: Repeating his charge that Prime Minister   had done none of what he had promised to deliver to the people of Varanasi, Congress vice president   said on Monday the PM had become tense ever since he saw the success of SP-Congress joint roadshow in Varanasi on March 4.

 Addressing a rally in Mungra Badshahpur assembly of Jaunpur on the last day of campaigning, Rahul alleged the PM Modi did four “retakes“ to achieve the success that Akhilesh and his roadshow did in Varanasi, but failed to draw crowds even after the fourth attempt. Saying that Kashi has taken a turn for the better, Rahul took a dig at the PM's advancing years and said it was time to give the ageing PM some rest.
 
 “The PM is doing everything on his own. He travels abroad alone and tells (foreign minister)   to stay home. He retired LK Advani. He even told (Union home minister) Rajnath Singh not to do anything. Modiji is doing everything himself. He is old and must be getting tired. I told Akhilesh we must help him; give him some rest. Akhilesh should be chief minister and we will send Modi back to Delhi,“ Rahul said. Alleging that Modi repeated roadshows, his visit to former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri's house, and his feeding cows on the last day of campaigning were signs of desperation from the PM. The Congress vice-president also said that while the PM had failed to be the ideal son to `Ganga maiyya', he and Akhilesh had concrete plans for UP's youth. Saying that he wanted to put UP on the world map as a manufacturing hub, Akhilesh added that he SP-Congress government, once voted to power, would prepare a five-point manifesto for the youth, promising them easy loans, and free skill training facilities in every district, among other things.
