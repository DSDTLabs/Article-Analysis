KOLKATA:   and its surrounding areas are set for more development. The   (NDITA) has come up with a number of   to give the   a makeover. NDITA officials said that with about 1.5 lakh people coming to   everyday for work, and with a residential population of 400, there is a definite need to spruce up the civic infrastructure.

 The plans include setting up a Town Hall-like building, green landscaping to beautify the Salt Lake Bypass and setting up a food court and multi-storied car park. Among other major decisions is developing a bicycle track along the Salt Lake Bypass stretch that connects Sector V to EM Bypass.
 
 “The Salt Lake Bypass stretch is a part of the Biswa Bangla Sarani that starts from EM Bypass, goes via Sector V and New Town, and ends at Haldiram’s junction on VIP Road. A dedicated bicycle track is already coming up on the service road stretch in Action Area I in New Town and another bicycle track on the Salt Lake Bypass stretch will further help to beautify Biswa Bangla Sarani. IIT-Kharagpur will be preparing a detailed project report on cycle tracks along this stretch,” said an NDITA official.
 
 The green landscaping along Salt Lake Bypass will be entrusted to the forest department. 
 
 Inside Sector V, an expression of interest will soon be floated for preparing a design of a Town Hall. Besides, Mackintosh Burn Limited, a state enterprise, will be engaged for constructing the food court-cum-multistoreyed car park. Officials said that with the number of vehicles entering the IT hub increasing day by day, there is a need to have a multi-level car parking system to battle the space crunch.
 
 A new NDITA office is also on cards with the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) engaged to design and build it.
 
 NDITA authorities have already decided to come up with a street numbering system, in which the roads will be identified by numbers 1 to 38 and signboards will be put up at the end of all roads for easy identification.
