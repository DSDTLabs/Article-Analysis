Rajkot: The 219 fishermen released from Pakistan jail as a ‘goodwill gesture’ are likely to reach their home town in Saurashtra on January 9. However, one fisherman identified as Jeena Bhagwan (37), died in Pakistan jail just hours before his release. According to a fishermen body, Bhagwan died of cardiac arrest in a Karachi jail. 

 This is the second batch of fishermen to be released by Pakistan. Earlier on December 25, the Pakistan government had freed 220 Indian fishermen who were in jails for more than a year as a goodwill gesture after Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted his counterpart Nawaz Sharif on his birthday. 
 
 Most of the fishermen belong to coastal towns of Gujarat. Seventy-five fishermen are from Una, 65 from Kodinar, 32 from Diu, 10 from Porbandar, three from Sutrapada, two from Gir-Gadhda and one from Dwarka. The lot also includes 29 fishermen from Uttar Pradesh and one from Maharashtra.
 
 “Jeena belonged to Khan village near Una town of Gir-Somnath district. Fishermen leaders, including Veljibhai Masani and Rajya Sabha MP Chunibhai Gohel, are trying to get his body transported to India for final rites,” said Bharat Modi, president of Porbandar Fishermen Boat Association. 
 
 “The 218 released fishermen are likely to reach Veraval by January 9,” Modi said. These fishermen were freed from Malir jail in Karachi, Pakistan. 
 
 Pakistan and India frequently arrest fishermen for violating territorial boundary in the Arabian Sea. Fishermen complained that they have to remain in jail for uncertain period and it affects their life and family members’ livelihood.
