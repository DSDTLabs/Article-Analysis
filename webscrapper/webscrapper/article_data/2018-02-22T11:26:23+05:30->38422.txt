MARGAO: The   (KVK) at Margao of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) will soon get an independent building for its   laboratory. Currently, the laboratory is housed in the premises of the   administrative building. A steady increase in the number of soil samples received by the laboratory for analysis has necessitated the construction of independent premises for the soil testing laboratory, official sources said.

 Deputy director of agriculture, Nevil Alfonso, who also holds charge of KVK, Margao, informed that the KVK plans to increase its awareness campaigns to educate farmers about the need to conduct soil investigation of their fields. “Nearly 5,000 to 6,000 soil samples are tested every year in each of the two soil testing laboratories in Goa. The number of farmers going in for soil testing is on the rise as they have realized the benefits of the tests. We have plans to create more awareness about the need for soil testing,” Alfonso told TOI. 
 
 Explaining the need for soil testing, agriculture officials pointed out that as the soils of Goa possess unique characteristics and have variable soil fertility status, nutrient deficiency is the major factor affecting crop production. “The soils and climatic conditions of Goa facilitate diverse crops. Efficient fertilizer management practices leads to higher yield and better quality of produce. The soil fertility status of the particular sample helps the farmer to adopt the recommended fertilizer management solutions,”  , assistant chemist at the KVK’s soil testing laboratory, Margao, said.
