NEW DELHI: Congress chief   has called a meeting of opposition parties on May 26 to discuss the upcoming Presidential election. In a move aimed at building on the preliminary consultations held among the anti-BJP parties, the gathering will discuss the probable Presidential candidates as also their prospects in the face-off which seems tilted in favour of the ruling  . 

 While   Gandhi has held talks with leaders of various anti-BJP parties, many satraps have also spoken among themselves on how to mobilise the regional outfits which are not committed to either side. Sources said the first joint huddle of the parties, to be held in parliament annexe, will send out a clear message about the opposition’s intent. The gathering will target BJP government for not reaching out to the opposition to build a consensus for the post which is seen as supreme and above partisan politics. While Trinamool Congress and Rashtriya   have confirmed their participation, a final list of parties which will join the meeting will be drawn up on Wednesday after their response. 
 
 JD(U) chief and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar recently asked the government to start the process of building a consensus on Presidential election, arguing that the opposition will be left with no choice but to field its candidate in the absence of an initiative from the ruling camp. The names of former governor Gopal Gandhi and former Speaker   have been discussed in the opposition camp as possible candidates. However, the “secular” camp will wait for the BJP to take the first step. Senior opposition leaders said they don’t want to be blamed by BJP for taking a unilateral stand on Presidential polls.
