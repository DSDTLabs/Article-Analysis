Actress-artist-activist   has opened Bengaluru’s newest informal art space that she calls The ARTery. She had an intimate launch recently, at which speed painter   and rapper All.OK performed. Also on display were paintings and photographs by eight amateur artists. Apart from this, there was also the unveiling of artist Baadal Nanjundaswamy’s 3D graffiti artwork and a wall that showcased his paintings of Mysuru. 
Samyukta says that she hopes to use this open space to encourage new talent, and also promote artists and teachers to connect with people with a passion to learn new things. The intimate launch saw many people from Bengaluru’s film, theatre and music fraternity drop by, which included Bhargavi Narayan, Prakash Belawadi, Rakshitha, Arvind Sastry, Suraj Gowda, Sruthi Hariharan, Meghana Gaonkar, Dhananjaya, Vasishta N Simha, Raghu Dixit and Rohit Padaki. The chief guest of the event was director KM Chaitanya’s pet beagle, Snoopy.   says that her space is pet-friendly.
 Samyukta plans to have intimate events that cut across varied art forms and genres to ensure that people are never short of a space when they want to express something. Her idea is to make this place a handshake between amateurs and professionals, and to ensure art stays alive.
