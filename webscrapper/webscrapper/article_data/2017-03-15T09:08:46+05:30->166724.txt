 “Once we are satisfied with the pilot project, we would begin the work of installation of these dustbins in other areas of the city too,” said an official. 
 
 It must be remembered that SMC collects nearly 1,650 metric tonnes of waste through different methods like door-to-door collection, through dustbins and others. Road cleaning and sweeping also plays a part in it.
