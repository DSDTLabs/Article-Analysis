CHENNAI: When a 54-year-old businessman,  , was wheeled into the emergency room with massive cardiac arrest, doctors recommended an immediate surgery. But there was only one request   made to the doctors - that he should return to work within two weeks. 

 When Hussain came for post-surgical review on Tuesday, doctors declared him fit to start work.
 
 "This would not have been possible if had conventional coronary bypass," said   minimally invasive cardiac surgeon Dr M M Yusuf.
 
 The patient was diagnosed with triple vessel coronary artery block and required intervention to improve blood flow to the heart. Doctors at once ruled out angioplasty and stenting as primary treatment as they do not recommend stents for more than two blocks.
 
 Minimally invasive hybrid revascularisation allows a surgeon, aided by a high definition camera and monitor, to work on a beating heart through a small incision between the ribs, without splitting the breastbone. tnn
