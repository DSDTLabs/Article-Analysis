UDHAGAMANDALAM: Two Indian gaurs died on Wednesday after an in-fight at   near Ooty. As the animals fought, their antlers locked together and they could not move. Forest officials tranquilized them and cut the tip of the horns to release them. However, the gaurs died within an hour. 

 According to   officer Saravana Kumar, a herd of gaurs fought each other near Yellanhalli. During the fight, antlers of two female gaurs were locked together and they could not move. “The animals rolled down and fell on   from around 50ft height,”   said. “The incident took place around 8am. We tried our best to unlock the entangled horns but in vain,” he added.
 
 As the animals blocked part of the main road, traffic was interrupted for around three hours. “We kept clearing off the traffic periodically,” said the official. 
 
 In the meantime, Dr Parthasarathy, a veterinarian from the nearby veterinary dispensary at Palada, was brought to the rescue operation. “The animals were tranquilized. Tips of horns of one of the animals were cut to unlock the horns,” said the forest official.
 
 After an hour, a revival injection was given to the animals by the veterinarian. “However, both the gaurs died one after other in a time gap of fifteen minutes. Both have suffered severe head injuries. They were bleeding through mouth and nasal,” Saravana Kumar said.
 
 Postmortem revealed that both the female gaurs had suffered severe head injuries. The carcasses were buried in a nearby forest area.
