Real-life couple   and  , who tied the knot in December 2016 following a courtship of six years, have never played a quintessential couple in a fiction show. When they finally got a chance to share screen space, the offer caught them off guard.   has been approached by the makers of ' ' to play hubby Suyyash’s elder sister.
Kishwer narrates, “The casting team of the daily soap called me with this offer and I was quite excited about taking it up as it’s Suyyash’s show. However, they soon dropped the bomb that I would be playing his sister. I couldn’t stop laughing and asked them if they were joking. When I realised that the offer was for real, I still decided to take it up. While   was apprehensive initially, I told him that it’s just a role. The good part is that we will get to shoot together and spend time with each other. It will be different from what I have done so far because I have never played my husband’s sister (laughs).”
 However, Kishwer has taken the challenge in her stride. She tells us, “There is an age difference of eight years between us. So, I always thought that we will never be able to play a couple as I look more mature than him. I found the offer to play his sister really funny, but took it up as I wanted to see how comfortable we would be doing it. In fact, since the moment it’s finalised, I have been calling him bro,” laughs Kishwar.
