PATNA: With just a day left for filing of nomination papers for the biennial   elections,   on Sunday announced the names of Manoj Jha and Ahmad Ashfaque Karim as its nominees.

 Jha, a professor at Delhi University, is also RJD’s national spokesperson. Karim, on the other hand, is managing director of a private medical college in Katihar. He had unsuccessfully contested the 2010 assembly election on a Lok Janshakti Party ticket from Katihar. Karim had hit the headlines for allegedly selling question papers of his college’s MBBS entrance examination in 2013.
 
 RJD state president   said both Jha and Karim would file their nomination papers at 11am on Monday. He thanked party national president   for selecting the two candidates. “Both have worked in the field of education and contributed for the society,” Purbey said.
 
 Though Congress has so far not made any formal announcement of its candidate, sources said Akhilesh Singh is ahead in the race. Singh, a former RJD MP, had joined Congress after he was denied Rajya Sabha ticket in 2010. “Picking him as a nominee can also been seen as Congress’s trick to woo the upper caste,” said a party insider.
 
 However, former BPCC president Ashok Choudhary said the state Congress would further spilt if it gives Rajya Sabha ticket to Singh.
 
 The biennial Rajya Sabha elections will be held on March 23 and six members are retiring from Bihar.
