CHENNAI: With   facing its worst drought in several decades, all   have gone dry and   have curtailed the daily water supplies to people. In rural areas too, traditional water bodies have gone dry. People are spending a substantial portion of their monthly income in   through  

 In such a situation, a public sector bank spread through 16 districts of Tamil Nadu and involved in agriculture financing has announced personal loans up to 50,000 per household. The Pandyan Grameen Bank (PGB), head quartered in Virudhunagar and spread across districts like Madurai, Dindigul and other rice-bowl districts has announced the scheme last week.
 
 The loan scheme is titled Amudham drinking water scheme and is the first of its kind in the state, said N Ravichandran, chairman of the bank. It offers credit for construction of wells, sinking borewells, pipelines to overhead tanks in homes as well as construction of rain water harvesting systems.Loans can be procured for installing reverse-osmosis plants (RO) plants as well, Ravichandran said.
 
 The announcement comes at a time when the rural economy in the state is heavily stressed due to the drought.Crops have failed across the state and even livestock are dying due to shortage of water and fodder.
 
 “Every household is spending close to `1,500 per month for procuring water. Instead of that, it is better to spend that money on creating a permanent infrastructure like rain-water harvesting or other water system,“ he said.
 
 “Bottled water procured for drinking purposes does not have any reliability and it was better to trust the ground water in your locality ,“ Ravichandran said, explaining the reason for floating this loan. The loan comes at an interest rate of 12% payable over three years. “We have not set an upper limit on the total amount to be disbursed, he said.
 
 Pon Ayappan, a farmer in  , said this would benefit small and marginal farmers who were anyway hard-pressed for credit from banks.
