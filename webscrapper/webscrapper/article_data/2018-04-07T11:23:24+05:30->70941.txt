KANPUR: Senior   leader and   said that there were no differences in the party’s first family any more and his ties with party’s national general secretary   are amicable.

 Shivpal said that everything is fine in the party’s first family and it was now united. “We had a meeting in Delhi and we sorted out all the issues. Now, we will jointly fight communal forces,” said Shivpal while addressing media in Etawah, his native district.
 
 
 “We will start our movement from   and   police stations in Etawah, where complaints of police atrocities have been on rise. There is a spurt in complaints of people alleging that police have been slapping false charges on those who approach police stations with complaints,” said Shivpal and added that victims have videos of police atrocity in evidence.
 
 The anger of people is spilling on streets as Centre and state governments have failed to meet their expectations, he said.
 
 “Both Modi-led Centre and Yogi-led state governments won’t last for long as people are totally fedup with their ‘GST’ and ‘notebandi’. Small traders are completely ruined. Good fortunes are for only few ‘big people’ under their regime. Now, SPBSP combine will wipe them (BJP) out completely,” said Shivpal. He added that BJP is only expert in ‘jumlebazi’ (rhetoric). “Their ‘jumlebazi’ won’t work any more,” he said on Thursday.
