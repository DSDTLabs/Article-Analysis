HYDERABAD: A gang involved in pilfering fuel with the help of oil tanker drivers was responsible for Medipally fire mishap on January 12, resulting in death of RTC employee   and burn injuries to 14 others. Police arrested two persons, including oil pilferage racket kingpin, on Saturday. 

 Police arrested  , 37, welding workshop owner and his brother Jagdeep Kulal, 34, for stealing fuel from tankers and selling it for low price. "On Friday, we got info of the fire and explosion in Kamalanagar, Chengicherla. On reaching the spot, police noticed two fuel tankers engulfed in flames on welding shop premises owned by the accused. One of the tankers exploded and its tail piece hit the adjacent house. The house was damaged and 15 people passing towards   sustained burns,"   joint commissioner of police Tarun Joshi said. Venkatesh who suffered 70% burns, succumbed on Sunday night while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital.
 
 Malkajgiri DCP Ch R Umamaheshwara Sharma said the two had an understanding with tanker drivers, who loaded fuel at depots of various oil PSUs to supply to filling stations. "The drivers would bring the tankers to the welding shop and the accused would steal about 40-50 litres so that the fraud goes unnoticed. The accused and drivers shared the profit. The racket did not come to notice as some quantity of fuel gets evaporated during transportation," the DCP added.
 
 Police seized 7.49 lakh cash, two four-wheelers, two bikes, 10 oil tankers and three phones. A magistrate remanded the duo to judicial custody.
