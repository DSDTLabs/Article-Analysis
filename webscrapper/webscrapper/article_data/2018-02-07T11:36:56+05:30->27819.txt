 The 35-year-old actor, who plays billionaire BDSM addict in the film based on the popular book series of the same name by E L James, told   on her show that the third film would be the 'last one'.
 
 "I don't think there's any...I mean there's no other books. (E L James) wrote the first two books again from Christian's perspective, but I guess we've already seen..."
 
 "We've done those films, the same story, so they won't do that again. Unless Erica keeps writing, but Dakota (Johnson) and I are... Particularly me, I'm gettin' too old for... For this," Dornan said. The actor said he likes how his character has grown over the course of time. 
 
 "I think I like him more now than I did in the first movie. I think he's gone through quite a big change in his way and how he is with people. He's opened up a lot by Anna and I think he's just a better version of himself," Dornan said. 
 
 The last installment in the franchise,  , releases on February 9.
