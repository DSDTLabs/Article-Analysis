BENGALURU: Prominent city doctors and public health experts have said that the death of   points to the government failure in allocating enough resources and funds to boost healthcare in the state's rural areas.

 “Healthcare should be as fundamental a right as right to vote, education and food.Poor infrastructure, widening gap in the availability of trained personnel besides inadequate supplies of essential medicines are to be blamed,“ said a renowned city doctor.
 
 “We certainly could use nurse practitioners, physicians and assistants at PHCs and provide them electronic access to the taluk or district hospitals,“ the doctor added.
 
 A public health expert from Bengaluru's Institute of Public Health ( ) said, “Karnataka has invested in a wide network of PHCs. We, however, have to improve our “human“ investment through making more doctors, nurses and other health workers available at all the PHCs.“
 
 “Although attempts have been made to distribute 108 ambulances to the taluk hospitals, no ambulance has been allocated for the PHCs,“ said another noted doctor, “Karnataka has one ambulance for 85,000 people, which isn't bad. The issue is availability of an ambulance at the right time, for which more of these are needed,“ said another public healthcare expert.
