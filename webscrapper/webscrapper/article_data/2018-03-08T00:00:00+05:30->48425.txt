I have always been a big fan of films. I have always watched and been drawn to the magic of the celluloid. This was probably why I knew when I was very young, that I would somehow be doing something that would be related to cinema when I grew up.
 
 After I completed my 10th, I got to know that there was a diploma course for sound and television being offered at Doordarshan. The fact that television was also a part of the course was what got me to sign up for the course. Though, it was only after signing up for the course that I realized that television was just an elective that we would have in our final year. Through the other years, I got to learn a lot about sound engineering and design. This had me intrigued and I feel taking up this course was one of the best blessings in disguise. While the journey, over 28 years, has not been anything compared to easy, I find it gratifying that I’ve been part of some good cinema in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Hindi — from Mankatha, Goa, Goli Soda, Paiyya to  , Neer Dose, Jessie and Jaisimha, Nannaku Prematho and Sholay 3D. 
 
 
 It is a male-dominated industry and when I started out, it was very difficult. It was a challenge every single time when I entered the console room and had to prove to the makers that I knew what I am doing. Now, I see it has changed a little — for the better. But, it is still a pity that they discriminate based on gender. People who I’ve worked with before are comfortable roping me in again, but when newer teams look out, they directly opt for men. I wish to see a bigger change in terms of that attitude.
