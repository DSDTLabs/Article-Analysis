LUCKNOW: After buffalo meat, shortage of mutton (goat meat) may hit the city by Saturday-Sunday.   went off shelves following closure of   from Tuesday, leading to an increase in   by around 40%. But dealers say they do not have enough livestock to meet the demand. The price of the local breed has also gone up by 30-35%.

 Before the buffalo meat supply was cut off, there was a demand of 3,000 goats in two mandis — Billauchpura and Basheeratganj near Naka Hindola — that has now increased to 4,250. Around 10 kg meat is extracted from a goat, which means the requirement of meat as per demand has increased from 30,000 kg to 42,500 kg daily. 
 
 In Billauchpura, goats are sold three days a week — on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The average sale per day used to be around 400. The crackdown began on Wednesday and on Thursday, over 600 goats were sold at Billauchpura, an increase of 50%. In Basheeratganj, goats are sold seven days a week with average daily sale of around 200. After crackdown, it has risen to 350, a 75% increase.
 
 Dealers and suppliers said they bought goats from farmers in Lucknow and adjoining districts. “Finding as many goats as to meet the huge demand is difficult,” said Furqan, a dealer associated with the Billauchpura mandi. Farmers in our network say they cannot provide more than 100-120 goats per day, he said. 
 
 Suppliers said they were also facing transportation problems. “Trucks carrying goats are being stopped by police at toll plazas,” said Shafeen Qureshi, a dealer and member of All India Jamiat-ul Quresh Association. If the situation prevails till Sunday, we would be forced to stop sale,” he said.
