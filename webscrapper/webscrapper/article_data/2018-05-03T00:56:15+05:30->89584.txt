Madurai: Curtains will come down on the Chithirai festival when Lord Kallazhagar will leave for his abode in a floral palanquin, in Madurai on Thursday. The deity of the Alagarkoil hills, which reached Madurai, entered the river on Monday and participated in a series of rituals. 

 The Dasavatharam, the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu, were performed throughout the night at the Ramarayer mandapam, with thousands of people gathering there to witness rituals.
 
 He left the Ramarayer mandapam on Wednesday night and reached the Ramanathapuram Sethupathi mandapam where special pujas were performed throughout the night. 
 
 This will be followed by a procession of the deity in the floral palanquin.
