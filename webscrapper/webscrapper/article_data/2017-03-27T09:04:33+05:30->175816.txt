 is Bollywood’s original diva – be it with her stunning looks or her charming ways, the actress can knock your socks off. And now, the former Miss Universe has shown us that she’s just as amazing when it comes to shaking a leg too.

 Sushmita shared an adorable   that sees her dancing to Ed Sheeran’s popular number ‘Shape of you’. And guess who her dance partner is? It’s none other than her younger daughter Alisah. The two can be seen matching steps as they groove to the chartbuster. While the little one looks cute as she shakes a leg, it is the ‘Main Hoon Na’ actress who owns her moves. Sushmita posted the video on her   handle with the message, “#frameofmind there is a song I love by #leeannwomack ‘when you get the chance to sit it out or dance, I hope you dance’ these moments (be it around my #friends or my #babies) are a wonderful reminder that each time a situation suggested to ‘SIT IT OUT’…WE CHOSE TO DANCE moving to our own beat #anytime #anywhere #anyhow   with beaded hair owns her moves #toocute Renee saunters down the beach celebrating life with #maa #memories #cherished #happiness #sharing I love you guys!!! #ihopeyoudance.”
