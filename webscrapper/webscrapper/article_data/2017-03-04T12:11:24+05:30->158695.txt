SASARAM:   on Thursday ordered the arrest of   chairman  , vice-chairperson Sunit Devi, executive officer Virendra Kumar,   and five ward councillors in around Rs2.5 crore LED lamp scam in 2014. 

 Police sources said a named FIR was lodged in February last year on the written complaint of the present executive officer of the council, Jamal Akhtar Ansari. Virendra and Alok were made accused in the FIR lodged with Dehri-on-Sone police station, alleging that in the name of commissioning LED light in the town, about Rs2.5 crore was embezzled as neither the tender was invited nor the light was installed. There was no supplier as well.
 
 “During the investigation, police found the tender for installation and supply of light was not floated as the public relation department had not issued order for publication of any tender. It was also found that the supplier firm to which the payment was claimed to have been made did not exist,” a police officer said.
 
 According to police, the inquiry also revealed that a seven-member empowered committee of the council headed by its chairman, also gave approval for supply of light and issued false certificate that lights had been installed in different localities of the town. “When a team visited to the address of the supplier in Chhapra, it found that a fertilizers shop run there,” said a police offer, adding that it was also found that eight people whose name did not appear in the FIR were also involved in the racket and the report was placed before the SP for further direction.
 
 “Now, the SP has ordered for arrest of 10 accused and police will launch raid to arrest them,” said a police officer.
