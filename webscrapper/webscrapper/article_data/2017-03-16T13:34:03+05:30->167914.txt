Actor   says he was initially unsure about the ending of ' ', as he believed it would have been more powerful if   survived. 

 The 48-year-old actor makes his eighth and final appearance as the clawed mutant Wolverine in the recently released 'X-Men' spin-off, and has said he wasn't sure about the movie's final scenes when he first read the script. 
 
  
  
 In the movie, Wolverine - also known as the titular 'Logan' - meets a noble end when defending X-23 and her fellow young mutants from the Reavers, and Jackman says he originally believed it would have been more powerful if he didn't die. 
 
 "It was always floated that Logan would possibly die. I said, 'Let's be open, because it may be more powerful for him not to die...   was always certain of that ending, and he was right."
 
 "Unlike a human character, what's most poignant for someone who is thought to be indestructible is him dying while saying, 'This is what it feels like'."
