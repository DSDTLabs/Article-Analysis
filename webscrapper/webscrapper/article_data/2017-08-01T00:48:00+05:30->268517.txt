Coimbatore: A 38-year-old daily wage labourer tried to immolate himself and his four children inside the district   campus by pouring kerosene on Monday. His neighbours said he was desperately trying to get the collector’s attention and help because a political functionary was trying to encroach on a piece of land that he and his children were living in. 

 Around 11.30am, Raja, who lives on a 1.5 cent of land in Kaliapuram, took a large can of kerosene from a bag and poured it over himself and his children, aged between four and 12 years. Shouts from a couple of his neighbours, who accompanied him, grabbed the attention of the police who rushed to him, threw away the can and held both his hands. They separated the children from each other and took them out of the campus. The police also dragged the sobbing man outside the collectorate campus, where they poured buckets of water on him and his children. Between his sobs, he kept repeating that “they are telling us to vacate our house.”
 
 Raja had built a semi-thatched house on his land about 15 years ago. The man has been single-handedly bringing up his four children, after his wife, Selvi, died two years back. “The man claimed that a woman called Pulli alias Vijaya has been claiming for the past one month that there is a snake pit outside his house and that she wanted to build a temple around it. Thus she wanted the land on which he was living,” said a police officer. 
 
 “The man also claims to have earlier filed a complaint with the Podanur Police Station, but no help came so he took this drastic step,” he said. The police are investigating further.
