CHENNAI:   general manager   on Wednesday honoured a   who created circuit alterations to enable emergency routes in case of a failure.

 M G Jyothi, a senior section engineer (drawing, signal and telecommunication), developed circuit alterations which enable emergency route release of signals for operation of routes in the event of a failure. 
 
 The emergency route release circuit is to be used by the technicians whenever the route is held up at stations which have electronic interlocking. This has enabled quick and safe restoration of working, thus avoiding unnecessary detention to trains, according to a release from the Southern Railway.
 
 Jyothi was given a cash award of Rs 4,000 and a certificate to recognise her contribution.
