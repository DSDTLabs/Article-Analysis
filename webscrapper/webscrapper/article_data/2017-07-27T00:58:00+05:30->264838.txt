Dharmapuri: The district administration has temporarily suspended coracle riding at Hogenakkal on Wednesday following a increasing inflow of water in River Cauvery.

 After the recent rain spell in Karnataka, the state government has released 9,000 cusecs of water from Kabini and KRS (Krishnaraja Sagar) dams about two days ago. “The released water has started to arrive at Hogenakkal and Mettur dam,” said a official from the Central Water Commission (CWC). 
 
 “The inflow in the river was 2,000 cusecs last week and started to increase from Monday. It has crossed 4,000 cusecs on Monday, 5,600 cusecs on Tuesday and 6,200 cusecs on Wednesday morning, while touching 7,000 cusecs on the same evening,” said officials from CWC. 
 
 Meanwhile, the level of water in the Mettur dam has rised from 27ft on Tuesday to 28ft on Wednesday. The inflow to the dam was marked as 5,789 cusecs while the discharge was maintained at 500 cusecs.
