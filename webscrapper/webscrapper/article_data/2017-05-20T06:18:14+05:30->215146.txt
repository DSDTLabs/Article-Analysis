YAVATMAL: The chief executive officer (CEO) of Yavatmal   (ZP) Deepkumar Singla has ordered probe into the government-sponsored   scam.

 He gave the order after confirming the veracity of the story carried out by TOI on Thursday, which stated that the Centre’s well scheme was marred by corruption.
 
 “I called the block development officer of Yavatmal panchayat samiti with the files related to the scheme. On verification, it was found that a prima facie case was made out against the then sarpanch Vilas Gawande of   village,” Singla said.
 
 “The report will be presented to me within a week. On receipt of the inquiry report, we shall file an FIR against the guilty,” he said.
 
 The CEO also admitted that over 100 complaints have been received about corruption in government-sponsored schemes being implemented by the Zilla Parishad. “We are viewing them seriously and action is on the anvil,” Singla added.
