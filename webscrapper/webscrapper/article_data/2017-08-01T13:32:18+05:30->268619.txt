PATNA: CPI (ML) general secretary   on Monday said chief minister   has surrendered before PM Narendra Modi by returning to the  .

 “The mandate that the people of the state had given to the Grand Alliance of RJD, JD(U), Congress and other like-minded parties in the 2015 assembly election was against PM Modi, the  , communal and fascist forces,” Dipankar told mediapersons here. Party’s other functionaries, including Kunal, Dhirendra Kumar Jha and Rajaram Singh were also present. “By joining hands with NDA, Nitish has handed over the state to communal and regressive forces,” Dipankar added. 
 
 He said a Rajya Sabha member and BJP sympathiser, in his column, has likened the speed and manner of the execution of the BJP brass’s plan regarding formation of new NDA government in Bihar to Hitler’s blitzkrieg during Second World War and the Israeli occupation of Golan Heights. “This admission has come from a BJP insider. It shows the true colours of the party and its leadership,” Dipankar said, adding Nitish’s rule was marked by mismanagement of the treasury and topper scam. 
 
 “What Nitish has done is an instance of extreme opportunism,” Dipankar said, adding the CPI (ML) and its affiliates would launch a struggle against unhealthy practices in democracy and also for the rights of farmers.
