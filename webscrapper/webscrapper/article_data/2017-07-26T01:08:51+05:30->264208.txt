NOIDA: Members of the   (NEA) on Tuesday made an appeal to senior officers of the   that the 18%   imposed on all   be waived.

 NEA members claimed that industries in Noida have always been exempt from tax on lease rent and this newly imposed tax could affect working costs. They also claimed that they were yet to see the real impact of ‘ease of doing business’ on the ground.
 
 NEA members also made an appeal to the industrial body to defer the e-way bill process or cancel it altogether as it would add to the complexity of the taxation process. After the introduction of GST, entrepreneurs involved in inter-state trade would have to fill up and document e-way forms. While the Union government has advised the introduction of e-way forms be held back till October, in UP it is applicable from July 26.
 
 “GST was meant to be based on the concept of ‘one nation one tax’. The e-way form is an additional formality for all businessmen to fill up and submit every time there’s a transaction with another state. This is not very different from the process followed during the sales tax regime,” Vipin Kumar Malhan, president, NEA, said.
 
 The entrepreneurs also placed a formal request with the Authority to transform Sector 10 into a wholesale material trade zone so that Noida manufacturers do not have to depend on Delhi wholesale markets to procure raw material. The businessmen also appealed to the Authority officers that the industrial sectors be provided with drinking water supply. 
 
 “There’s no provision for proper drinking water in the industrial areas. We have made an appeal for such a supply since such a large number of people are engaged as workforce in these areas,” Malhan said.
