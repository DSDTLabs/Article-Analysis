ZIRAKPUR: A delay in removing encroachment from   area of this town has inconvenienced residents of eight housing societies that are tired of complaining with the deputy commissioner and executive officer ( ) concerned. 

 The unified welfare association of these eight societies met on Wednesday and decided to take a fresh representation next week to the authorities concerned. Unified association president K R   said while sharing the details of the meeting that: "Three major issues concerning the residents were discussed. Nearly 150 slum dwellers have encroached upon public land near Solitary Divine society in Dhakoli and the residents had reported it last November. The dwellers have illegal electricity and water connections also but they aren't being evicted."
 
 The EO had assured the association in December that all encroachment would be removed after the demolition squad is able to get the police cover that the subdivisional magistrate has asked for. In Tuesday's meeting, it was decided that the issue will again be taken up with the authorities concerned. Another issue was the lack of water at the cremation ground, which also has no boundary wall.
 
 An open sewer near the cremation ground is a constant source of stink, and on top of that, the residents have started tossing garbage into it. The gutter gets choked and the residents have to time and again approach the authorities concerned for its cleaning. Sharma said the   had cleaned it only recently but again it had got clogged a few days ago.
