MUMBAI: With the National   and Accreditation Council (NAAC) bringing about major changes in their assessment process,   will have to wait longer to get re-accredited. The university’s accreditation expires on April 20. However, NAAC’s new data-driven process, with little weightage to the peer team review (the process followed for years), will be implemented only by August this year.   is in the process of devising a new comprehensive format that will seek more information online and make the process more objective and transparent.

 From April 21, the   will cease to have a NAAC grade and will not be allowed to use the ‘A’ grade on any official platform. “The last time there was a gap of few years before the university got itself re-accredited. This time, there will be a new format and the Internal Quality Assurance Cell will be responsible for the collating the data for the self-study report,” said the official. The new format will be applicable to all institutes and universities going in for accreditation or re-accreditation from April 1. As of now, the process of accepting the letter of interest (LOI) has been suspended too.
 
 An official from the council, said that they will be revising the accreditation framework and make it more data-driven. “It will be more stakeholder friendly. We will have a consultation in the public domain, seek feedback and then implement it, may be by August this year. There will be minimal human discretion and the process will be more transparent,” said the official. He added that most of the information will be sought online and the peer team review, which used to take three to four days, will be cut short. The process will be ICT (information and communication technology)-enabled henceforth.
