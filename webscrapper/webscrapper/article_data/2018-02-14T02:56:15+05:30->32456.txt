NEW DELHI: Hundreds of students from different colleges of Delhi University joined hands at Art Faculty on Tuesday to support Delhi Commission for Woman ( ) chief Swati Jaihind’s movement against the growing incidents of sexual harassment and rapes in the capital.

 The students and Jaihind launched the campaign ‘Rape Roko’, along with a website raperoko.org for common people to join the movement.
 
 “Since the day I saw the eight-month-old baby fighting for her life in the hospital after being raped, it is very hard for me to close my eyes. Six cases of rape of minors are reported every single day in the city. If we, the people, keep quiet in our homes and just keep saying that it should not happen, this will not end. I have not been home for the past 14 days. Everyone should come and join the movement for justice,” said Jaihind.
 
 “No one is safe here. Even proving her point and collecting evidence tires survivors, who quit the fight for justice most of the time. It happens because of our slow system which does not take the situation seriously,” she added.
 
 Demanding fast-track courts, strict punishment and death penalty for rapists, nearly 300 students from various colleges of DU along the DCW chief marched from the Vishwavidyalaya metro station to Arts Faculty, covering Patel Chest institute, Daulat Ram College, Miranda House, Khalsa, SRCC and Ramjas College.
 
 “The incidents of rape and harassment are increasing day-by day. Now, we fear trusting even our loved ones. In the case of the Bharti college student fighting for her justice, the college has still not taken any action against the professor. If we will not raise our voice, the next will be me, my sister or anyone,” said Shelly Bansal, student of Swami Shraddhanand College.
 
 The protest will be continued till March 8. The group has also planned to call a nationwide protest on the International Woman day.
