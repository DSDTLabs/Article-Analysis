NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University constituted a committee on Tuesday to initiate an inquiry in the alleged   of teachers in the academic council meeting held on December 26. While the student body says this move is an attack on the university’s culture, teachers claimed they didn’t know about it, and would wait for an official notice before reacting. 

 The students say that the vice chancellor is using the inquiry to threaten the students and staff. “VC is an outsider who has no idea about the varsity’s culture or how it functions. He uses threats to operate,” said Mohit Pandey,   student union president. 
 
 The teachers, however, gave out a measured response, claiming that it was just a rumour. “We have not received any such notification till now,” said Bikramaditya Choudhary, secretary of JNU Teachers’ Association.
 
 Meanwhile, the 11 students who were suspended for allegedly disrupting the meeting said the inquiry committee is set up just to target them. “We have been targeted as we repeatedly raise our voices against the discrimination in the university,” said Mulayam Singh, member of the United OBC Forum and one of the suspended students.
