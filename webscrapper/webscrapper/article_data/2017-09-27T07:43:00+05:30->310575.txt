Ludhiana: A 29-year-old businessman of Model Town went   in the wee hours of Monday. He parked his car at Sarabha Nagar market, where he has a shop, kept his phone inside it and left. Before leaving, he sent an email to his brother, saying he was “going somewhere and they don’t need to take tension”.

 His family, however, lodged a police complaint, fearing someone has confined Sarabhjot Makkar. His father Bhupinder Singh said Sarabhjot has a DJ business and on Monday, he parked his Hyundai Creta car in Sarabha Nagar market around 2am and went missing.
 
 Investigating officer from Model Town police station ASI Dalvinder Singh said it was found during preliminary investigation that Sarabhjot took a cab from Sarabha Nagar market and went to the railway station. The cab dropped him outside the rear gate of the railway station, but he has not been captured in the CCTV cameras installed there.
 
 The ASI said it was suspected that Sarabhjot did not enter the railway station and went somewhere else. The inquiry has revealed that he had financial issues with former partners, from whom he was to get some money. However, police are yet to verify this.
 
 The police have registered a case under Section 346 (wrongful confinement in secret) of the IPC. Sarabhjot has taken along his laptop and another phone, which he has put on call divert mode.
