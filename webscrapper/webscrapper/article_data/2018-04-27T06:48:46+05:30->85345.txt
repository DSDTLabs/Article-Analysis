MUMBAI: The state   has stated that the original list of college preferences submitted by students would prevail for   medical  .

 The commissioner said that candidates who cannot afford the new fees that private colleges were allowed to charge in a decision taken a few days ago, will be considered for making changes in their college preference list in the second round. This would be so even if they have not joined a college in the first round. 
 
 
 
  
 
 The CET commissioner went against the decision of the Directorate of   Education and Research, which had stated that the   medical admission process should be started right from scratch to ensure that meritorious students do not lose out in the bargain.
 
 Several students who were admitted to government colleges met the admission regulating authority and demanded that the existing seat allotment should not be disturbed. They said that fresh admissions must be conducted only in private colleges and for the unfilled government seats, as also for the surrendered all-India quota slots. Students had also threatened to move court as the re-starting of the admission process would be in contravention of a court ruling that state governments must release their first allotment list before the second list of the all-India quota is out.
 
 All participating colleges have been directed to keep admission counters open at weekends and holidays to facilitate admissions. Students wanting to join the allotted colleges need to report to the respective institutes between April 27 and 29.
