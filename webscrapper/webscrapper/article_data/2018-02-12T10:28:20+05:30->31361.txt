AGARTALA: The last leg of campaigning in Tripura has picked up pace.   national president   kicked off his road show, followed by rallies across West Tripura and   districts. 

 His first road show - from Bamutia to Mohanpur - was followed by rallies at Chowmanu and Teliamura. In the afternoon, he led a road show from Chandrapur to Agartala. 
 
 Hitting back at   for his accusation that the Centre had not done much for the state's development, the BJP chief listed a number of central schemes and said it had released Rs 25,396 crore to Tripura under the 14th finance commission, against the Rs 7,283 crore it had got under the 13th finance commission. "Where has the extra Rs 18,000 crore gone? It has gone into pockets of Communist cadres. I dare Sarkar to give an account of this money in his public meeting," Shah said.
 
 "The Left has been finished off in the world and the Congress is fading away in the country," the BJP national president said. "The government of Lal bhai and its cadres have looted Tripura for 25 years in the name of development. A BJP government is bound to come. It won't merely be a change of MLAs or the government, but will usher actual transformation," he added. 
 
 Without naming  , he added that the Congress chief has put up candidates as 'vote-katva' (candidates set up to facilitate division of votes) to help the CPM government headed by Chief Minister Manik Sarkar to come back to power.
 
 Shah is scheduled to hold a review meeting with the party's state committee leaders. On Monday, Shah will address three consecutive public meetings at Takarjala, Gandacherra and Khowai before his departure for New Delhi in the evening.
