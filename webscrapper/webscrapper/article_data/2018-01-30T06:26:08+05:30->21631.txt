AHMEDABAD: At 11.30pm on Sunday, a message was broadcast from a   to all those on municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar’s Facebook friends list. The message said Kumar was in dire straits and needed money urgently. The message even had a mobile wallet number, into which contributions were sought. The size of the contributions sought was Rs 3,000.

 A few of Kumar’s friends sensed fraud, after they received a ‘friend request’ from an account masquerading as Kumar’s. They alerted the municipal commissioner at around midnight. 
 
 “A few concerned individuals told me that they were surprised to receive a ‘friend request’, when they were already on my friend list. Sensing trouble, I immediately posted a message on my Facebook wall to ignore the fraudulent message,” said Kumar. 
 
 The civic chief then quickly registered a complaint with the cyber cell, mentioning the mobile wallet number. Facebook acted quickly and deleted the fake account. “The fake account had mimicked my Facebook page. The account vanished in 10 minutes as soon the alert was sounded,” says Kumar.
 
 A senior professor at Cept University also faced a similar problem a few years ago. A group of students had alerted the teacher and the fake account was dealt with. 
 
 A senior statistician with a stock-broking company, Hitesh Lavania, also faced a similar problem in November 2017. “Around 4pm, my wife began getting phone calls from my friends to know ‘how seriously I was injured’ and whether I was out of coma. I realised that a message had been broadcast seeking Rs 2 lakhs transferred to an ICICI account. I immediately alerted my friends. I realised that four days earlier, I had posted pictures on my Facebook account while I was on my way to Jaipur for a holiday. The perpetrator had timed the scam message broadcast,” says Lavania.
