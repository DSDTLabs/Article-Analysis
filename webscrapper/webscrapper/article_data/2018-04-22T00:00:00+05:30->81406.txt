Getting my name on the voter list was no hassle at all, especially since my parents are always on top of such things. If we want to better our lifestyles, then voting is a huge step in that direction. It is important to remember that the step we take in less than a month’s time (to vote) will determine what happens for the next five years at least. It may be just one day and just one act of casting a vote, but that will decide how much the chosen candidate does to make the city safer and better to live in. The only way to secure a better future is to   in large numbers. I think that doesn’t happen in big cities like Bengaluru because people don’t really know who to vote for. We read so much negative news and wonder where the people we elected are at such times, and what they are doing to ensure that these things don’t happen. I think that that attitude deters people from voting. Having said that, voting for the right person is the only way to solve this problem.
