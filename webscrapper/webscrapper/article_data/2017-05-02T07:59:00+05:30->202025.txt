Panaji: Urdu-medium classes at the government primary school in Massan De Amori in Panaji are expected to stop from the academic year June 2017 for want of students. 

 The Marathi and Konkani-medium sections of the school will, however, continue.
 
 The   section currently has an enrolment of only three and Urdu teachers said that the preference for English-medium schools is generally leading to dwindling numbers in Urdu-medium schools.
 
 From 2014-15 to the academic year 2015-16, the number of students studying in Urdu-medium government schools has declined from 1,800 to 1,378, according to the directorate of education’s own statistics.
 
 The school at Massan de Amori, one of the 15 Urdu-medium government primary schools presently operational in Goa, is the oldest known Urdu-medium school in Goa, offering   in the language for over 30 years now.
 
 Director of education G P Bhat said that teachers from the school will be moved to government primary schools in Urdu-medium elsewhere in the state. “Our government primary school in Urdu-medium running in Bicholim, Sakhali and Ponda areas are doing quite well with good enrolment. We will transfer the surplus teachers from Massan de Amori to those schools.”
 
 Principal of the Panaji-based Urdu institute Anjuman Nurul Islam High School, Abdul Aziz Mulla, however, said that numbers in Urdu-medium schools across Goa are generally on the decline. “Parents feel that the prospects of their children will be adversely affected if they study in Urdu medium and want them to study in English-medium schools now. They don’t mind spending extra to send their children to private   schools, and I don’t blame them. These schools do offer better systems for a price. Those who still send their kids to Urdu-medium are doing so only because they cannot afford an English school.”
 
 Like the Urdu-medium section at Massan de Amori, numbers are also going down in the three government primary schools in the medium operational in Vasco.
