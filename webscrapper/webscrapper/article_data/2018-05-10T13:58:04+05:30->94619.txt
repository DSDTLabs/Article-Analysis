TIRUPUR: The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has raised objection to the co-operative societies’ elections in   district as it alleged that the DMK and   has secretly joined hands for the polls.

 Five   candidates along with candidates from both AIADMK and DMK filed nominations for the post of directors in Kuralkuttai primary agricultural credit co-operative society’s (Paccs) elections. While the scrutiny of the nomination papers was scheduled on May 3, the election officer didn’t turn up and failed to release final candidates list, a CPM functionary said.
 
 The communist party said that AIADMK and DMK allegedly formed a secret alliance as they wanted only their candidates to contest in the elections. The election officer was working in favour of them.
