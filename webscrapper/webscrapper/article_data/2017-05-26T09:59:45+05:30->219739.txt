MUMBAI: The results of three municipal corporations in Maharashtra â€“ Panvel, Bhiwandi and Malegaon - will be out on Friday as the counting is set to begin at 10am. 

 For Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC), this is the first election after it came into existence in October last year. Skewed voting pattern in the PCMC area has made the Friday verdict a guessing game as speculation is on for a significant number of seats in the 78-member new civic house with 40 as the half way mark to post victory.
 
  MLA, Prashant Thakur is confident of retaining his hold in the Panvel node and elsewhere and making breakthrough in the village stronghold of PWP.
 
 In Malegaon, the BJP has fielded the maximum candidates ever for the Malegaon municipal corporation election, slated for May 24. The party has put candidates in 77 of the corporation's 84 seats, with over 45 of the contestants being Muslim. For BJP, this is a record number of tickets to Muslim candidates anywhere in the country in a single election. 
 
 In Bhiwandi-Nizampur City Municipal Corporation, that is ruled by a Congress-led alliance, the polling for all the 90 seats was held on Wednesday. Here, the AIMIM has fielded nine candidates.
