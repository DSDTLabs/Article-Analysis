BHOPAL: A toilet in her house would have probably saved the life of this girl. Chased by would-be rapists while out to relieve herself on Sunday night, she jumped in front of a   in a desperate bid to escape and was  . 

 The horrifying incident happened in a village near   town of Madhya Pradesh, some 70km from Gwalior. The hamlet is only a few kilometres from Datia, the district headquarters, but doesn’t have any toilet. Women have to relieve themselves in the open.
 
 The victim’s father told police that two suspects —   and Sanju Yadav — took advantage of this. They were stalking her for quite some time and were lying in wait when she stepped out of her house on Sunday night. They pounced on her but she broke free and started running along the railway tracks. Desperate to shake off her pursuers, she jumped across the tracks just when a train was speeding towards her. It hit her and killed her on the spot.
 
 Her death triggered a wave of anger in the village, forcing the administration to deploy additional forces in the area to quell tension. The body has been sent for autopsy. The suspects are yet to be arrested.
 
 This is not the first time lack of toilets has triggered a sexual crime in Madhya Pradesh. Women, especially minors, are vulnerable to sexual assault as they step out of their houses during odd hours. There are at least half a dozen recent cases of rape and molestation where women were attacked when they stepped out to relieve themselves.
 
 Officials refused to comment on the link between lack of proper sanitation and sexual crimes, they admitted there are close to 40 lakh families in the state without access to toilets.
