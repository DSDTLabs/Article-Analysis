NEW DELHI: In an Instagram post first thing on Sunday morning, PV   had crowned herself with a flower wreath. Winning the India Open title in the evening turned out to be the icing on the cake.

 A bundle of emotions and still breathless at the postmatch media conference, Sindhu praised herself. "I really played well. The first game was really crucial for me. It was a good match overall. I am really happy with my performance. We were fighting for each point. There were no easy points and there were long rallies."
 
 It was impossible to ignore the applause she received at the Siri Fort Complex. "I would like to thank the spectators. They were really very supportive," she said.
 
 Sindhu's father as well as coach   were in the arena to cheer for her. "Yesterday or day before, he (Gopi) was sitting among the spectators but was still giving me instructions. Today he sat by the courtside but it didn't really make much of a difference."
 
 Hard work has been Sindhu's template for success. Her 4.30 am regimen with coach Gopichand is something that kids talk about. "It's not about winning or losing. You have to just work hard and give your best. I think ups and downs are part of life but you will have to come back and train hard and improve yourself and that's what is really important."
 
 Carolina Marin, a picture of composure in defeat, confessed that all didn't go well with her game. "Today I couldn't play my natural game. I committed a few unforced errors and that was the key to the loss. The game was good for spectators but not for me. But I am happy with my overall performance this week."
 
 However, she didn't forget to mention that her best performance was in the Rio Olympic Games. "That was my goal for the year. After that I got some injuries but from January I am just getting better. Playing this week added to my confidence. Now I am motivated to fight hard and keep going in the next tournaments."
