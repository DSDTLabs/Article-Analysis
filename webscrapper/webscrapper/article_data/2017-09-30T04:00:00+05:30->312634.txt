 Dhorajiya (52), who lived in Varachha, used to work in a diamond unit. He fell unconscious at the diamond factory in Katargam on September 26. He was rushed to Kiran Hospital. He suffered brain haemorrhage and was declared brain dead on September 28, which happened to be World Heart Day. He is survived by wife Kailash (48) and engineer sons Purvik (25) and Ravi (23). Dhorajiya’s family members said, “If his organs can save someone’s life, we would want to donate them.” 
 
 Donate Life, a non-governmental organization, ensured that his heart was transported to Mumbai at Global Hospital. A distance of 269km was covered in 107 minutes on Friday. The heart was transplanted in the body of Moinuudin Sheikh, (43), a resident of Andheri, Mumbai. This was the 16th heart donation from Surat. 
 
 His liver and kidneys were accepted by doctors from the Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre, Ahmedabad, and will be transplanted in the bodies of organ transplant receivers at the earliest. Eyes of Dhorajiya were accepted by Dr Praful Shiroya from Lokdrashti Chakshu Bank.
