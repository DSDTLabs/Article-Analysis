Panaji: Calling its former MLA Vishwajit Rane, a traitor, the   on Wednesday said Rane’s induction into the cabinet by chief minister Manohar Parrikar was an admission of defeat for the BJP in the state.

 Reacting to the induction of Godinho and Rane, Congress spokesperson Girish Chodankar said Parrikar’s decision to induct them proved the “total political bankruptcy of BJP”.
 
 “Parrikar’s desperation was visible even before the election when he approached then Congress members Pandurang Madkaikar and Mauvin Godinho to contest on BJP tickets. Without these two party members, BJP’s tally would have gone down to 11 or even to a single digit,” Chodankar said.
 
 Of the 11 ministers in the cabinet, aside from Parrikar, four berths have been given to BJP members, of whom Madkaikar, Mauvin and Rane are ex-Congressmen.
 
 “It is time for Parrikar to stop engineering political arithmetic to save his chair as such kind of number game is not going to help for long. The fissures are already visible in the ruling government and the gap between BJP and its allies is going to widen in the days to come,” Chodankar said, adding that Rane would lose the impending Valpoi bypolls.
