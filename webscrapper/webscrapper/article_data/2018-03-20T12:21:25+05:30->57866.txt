LUCKNOW: A leopard was spotted hiding in a culvert under   at   under   police station on Monday morning. Police and forest officials arrived at the spot but could not catch hold of the leopard. 

 According to police, around 8.35am, a villager Mohit Kumar saw the leopard near the culvert and informed others. The villagers informed police on UP 100.
 
 A police team arrived and cordoned off the area before informing forest officials who came to the spot by 10am. 
 
 This happens to be the third instance of leopard spotting in the district.
 
 SO, Gosainganj, Vidya Sagar Pal said that a large number of villagers had gathered around the culvert. The first priority was to cordon off the area and then inform forest officials, he said.
 
 Senior veterinary officer Dr   is supervising the operations.
 
 The forest officials tried for over nine hours but failed to net the leopard in all their attempts. They even burst firecrackers to make the leopard come out of the culvert but failed.
 
 The incident again exposed the lack of preparedness on the part of forest officials to handle incidents of man-animal conflict.
 
 Divisional forest officer, Lucknow, Manish Sonkar said that efforts are on to safely trap the leopard. 
 
 DFO told TOI that a net has been put on the end of the culvert so that whenever the feline comes out it gets trapped in it.
 
 SO Pal said that the leopard was first spotted in the mustard fields on Saturday. The cattle also stopped going into the fields which alerted the villagers about the likely presence of some predator animal. But the roars of the animal were heard on Monday morning.
 
 The villagers told mediapersons that earlier, a leopard had strayed in fields of their village in 2008.
