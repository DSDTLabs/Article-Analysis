PHAGWARA: The  , Phagwara, held its meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss the prevailing situation in the town that had witnessed group clashes between the Dalits and right-wing Hindus on April 13.

 Various speakers who addressed the meeting were of the view that Dalit leaders, especially Jarnail Nangal and  , were being given a long rope by the administration.
 
 Apart from leaders of the Manch, local BJP leaders Rakesh Duggal, Ramesh Sachdeva and Inderjit Khalyaan as well as   block president Sanjeev Bugga also addressed the gathering that included several businessmen of the town.
 
 They alleged that the arrest of the Dalit leaders by Phagwara police was just an eyewash as they were arrested under softer provisions of the IPC and not under Sections 302 and 307 of IPC – pertaining to murder and attempt to murder – even as they were named in the same FIR which had these provisions.
 
 The speakers said if the Dalit leaders were not arrested under the stringent provisions, they would again organize a major dharna on the Banga road as was done three weeks ago.
 
 They also opposed the renaming of the chowk as Sanvidhaan Chowk stating that it had already been named as Phagwara MC had already passed a resolution to name it Shaheed Bhagat Singh Chowk in 2006.
 
 Manch’s Phagwara president advocate Vijay Sharma said all the accused in the FIR should be arrested under all the provisions and it was up to the court to decide their offence.
