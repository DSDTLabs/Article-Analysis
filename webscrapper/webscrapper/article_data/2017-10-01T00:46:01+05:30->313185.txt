Tuticorin: Usually, 75-year-old R Periyaperumal of Udangudi, about five kilometres from here, used to do   for not more than Rs 2,000 at Raja fancy store that he has been running for the last 40 years. He used to be the only one manning the shop as there were not many customers.

 For Dussehra, he has roped in 10 temporary staff paying daily wages of Rs 500 per person to run the show as he nets a business of Rs 80,000 to Rs 90,000 a day for these 10 days. “The business I have this season is more than what I make throughout a year,” he said. His is among over a dozen fancy stores in the locality which enjoy brisk business thanks to the demand for the costumes that devotees put on for the festival at Mutharamman temple.
 
 Masks, dummy weapon and a variety of dresses and hands made of sponge for dressing like goddess Kali are items that sell like hot cakes at these shops without much bargain. 
 
 Some of these items are made in the shop while the rest are purchased from various parts of Tamil Nadu. Hundreds of temporary snack and toy stalls in and around also enjoy good business.
 
 Though many offer Annadhanam (free food) to devotees and the public enroute, the season draws big business for the small eateries that are a few kilometres away from the village where the celebrations take place. R Ravi (48) who has an eatery for 10 years said that during normal days he used to have a business for Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 a day. “During Dussehra it easily crosses Rs 1 lakh a day even without revising the price. We are unable to cater to the heavy customer flow. Sadly, tomorrow is the last day of this season. Now, we have to wait for 355 days,” he said. 
 
 Other shops selling coconut, banana, garlands, floral decorations, pooja items, spiritual CDs and novelties near Mutharamman temple have also been experiencing a similar boom in business.
