CHANDIGARH:The ongoing work of laying cement slabs along a median on the Sector 44-50 dividing road opposite Indian Oil petrol-refuelling station has given rise to a civic problem. With the work almost finished, the leftover slabs have been left carelessly on the road, along the edge of the divider and in the path of oncoming traffic, which can prove to be dangerous.

 The rectangular blocks called ‘baran’ in Hindi were being laid on either sides of the divider for almost a week now. Neither the contractors nor the construction workers gave a thought to the consequences if some commuter coming on a two-wheeler at night hit any of the slabs fallen off the divider and scattered on the road for 5-6 metres. There’s a danger of accidents even during the foggy mornings and evenings.
 
 Along with the cement slabs that have slipped on to the road, there lay broken bricks and mud balls scooped out of the divider’s platform. These are scattered all along the divider. “The work began almost a week ago but no one would have noticed this,” said Ramesh, a   “But they are doing some cleaning too. The slabs can definitely damage a car that bounces off these at high speed.” 
 
 The traffic on the road grows with the setting sun. It pours in from Mohali, Kharar, and all over Chandigarh, and the slabs are a potential hazard to it. “The road receives   in the morning and evening hours and, sometimes, when the visibility is also low during fog, none of these obstructions are clear to the driver’s eye. The slabs should be removed quickly,” said  , a customer at the petrol pump.
 
 When asked, one of the contractors supervising the laying of these blocks, said: “If half of my labourers are working on fixing these cement slabs, the other half is cleaning the road. The road is very long, so it takes time, but the job will be done,” said contractor Raju.
