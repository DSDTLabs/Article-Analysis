MUMBAI: A woman in Vasai,  , had the fright of her life after the lift she stepped into came crashing from the fifth floor on Wednesday. Gomes resides in building number 10 in Agarwal Peace Avenue. 

 "After I pressed the ground-floor button, the lift slumped. Slabs began falling into the lift as it shook violently and landed on the ground with a thud. I pressed the third- and second-floor buttons but the lift did not stop," said Gomes. 
 
 On Thursday, Gomes filed an application before the   police, demanding an inquiry into the incident. "I have suffered internal pain. Please look into the maintenance issue of the lift," she wrote. The police have not yet filed a complaint, but plan to question members of the managing committee of the society and seek details about the lift maintenance. This is the second incident in the complex in six months. In July 2016, Pushkar Mandal (10) sustained injuries after he fell into the lift shaft as he opened the sliding door on the fourth floor even as the lift car was on the sixth floor. Mandal resides in building number 3. Mandal got entangled in the wires inside the shaft and was saved from crashing on to the ground. Mandal's screams alerted the building's residents who rescued him.
 
 Residents alleged that the elevator has not been serviced since the building came up 10 years ago. They alleged that no lift-maintenance contract was signed and problems frequently cropped up.
 
 "We have been drawing the attention of the building's office-bearers to problems related to the lift, but they have not been addressed," said a resident. The building's office-bearers could not be reached for comment.
