MUMBAI: To increase the presence of women on campus, IIT-Bombay is planning to promote   to school-going girls. It will also explore flexi-hours and   for researchers with younger children. To engage with society and industry, it will take up 10 research projects with local and state governments. It is also planning to incubate at least five start-ups and commercialize 10 patents in a year.

 These are some of the targets the premier institute has set for the next five years. Seventeen years after the last strategic plan was made, IIT-Bombay has come up with a new five-year plan based on feedback from stakeholders taken over two years. The institute has been running on the same goals set in 2000. While most targets have been achieved, some are yet to materialize, including faculty taking up parttime employment in industry,  , flexible teaching schedules, a smaller student-teacher ratio, no grading in first year undergraduate programmes, and attracting international students.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 A professor associated with the   (ISPC) said that instead of making broad-based plans like the previous years, this time, the committee has introduced specific metrics and targets to measure performance in 2022. For example, the institute is planning to start newer programmes, including in filmmaking, fine arts, and some in existing branches like earth science, biology and social sciences.
