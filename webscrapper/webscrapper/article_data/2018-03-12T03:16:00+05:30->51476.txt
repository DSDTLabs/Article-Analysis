Ponda: Villagers of Colem have alleged that blasting carried out by a mining company has damaged their houses. Based on these complaints, the Colem panchayat wants the government to send a team of experts to study the cracks on the walls of their houses and compensate them for the losses.

 “We have received 30 complaints from villagers seeking help from the panchayat. We have already written to the government departments concerned, but there was no response,” Colem sarpanch Gangaram Lambor said at a press conference convened at Ponda on Wednesday evening, in the presence of his deputy, Khushi Velip and panchayat members Arushi Sawant, Nilesh Satpalkar and Nandesh Desai.
 
 Lambor said the villagers have complained that the explosions have created cracks on the walls of their houses.
