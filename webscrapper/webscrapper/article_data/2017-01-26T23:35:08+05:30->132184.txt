NEW DELHI: Acharya  , the aide of   MP Janardan Singh Sigriwal, was shot dead in Bihar's Saran district on Wednesday.

 Giri was shot in the left temple by unidentified assailants late on Wednesday night. His body was found on Thursday morning. 
 
 Police said some people had come on two motorbikes to Giri's house in Raghunathgiri Mithia village - which is served by   police station - between 10.30 and 11 pm last night, and that Giri had left with them, never to return.
 
 Manjhi SHO Prabhakar Pathak said Giri could have known the assailants, since he didn't raised an alarm.
 
 When Giri didn't return, his family members began looking for him and his body was found barely 500 metres from his house.
 
 Locals protested after the murder, and asked that action be taken quickly, Times Now reported.
 
 BJP MP Janardan Singh Sigriwal said Giri's killing is "an outcome of the administration's utter failure".
 
 Sigriwal is the MP from the Maharajganj Lok Sabha constituency, where Manjhi is located.
