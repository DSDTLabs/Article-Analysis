PATNA: The   jawans in state went on an indefinite strike on Wednesday demanding equal pay for equal work. They deposited their arms and ammunition at their respective district headquarters on Wednesday evening. They had already been on strike since March 11 after their talks with DG (home guard) PN Rai on March 10 failed to reach any conclusion.

  general secretary   said their demand is based on a   ruling in 2015 that the home guard jawans should get remuneration equal to the police personnel while on duty.
 
 Paswan said there are 72,000 home guard jawans in Bihar out of which 32,000 are active on duty while the rest are involved in other works to meet their needs. Their indefinite strike would badly hit the security arrangements at banks, police stations, traffic control, fire stations, secretariat and several other government offices.
 
 “Home guards remain on duty like policemen, but they are paid just Rs12,000 monthly remuneration, which is very much less in comparison to a police constable,” Paswan said.
 
 He also said the home guard jawans are paid only for the period on duty. “Home guards demand equal pay for equal work with 365 days duty and five days leave every month,” said Paswan, adding that the Patna high court also issued orders to state government on the lines of Supreme Court on October 10 last year to give duty allowance equal to the state police personnel.
 
 He also said the home guards deployed in some departments have not received salary for the past several months. “Our salary is given by the department where we are posted on duty,” he added.
 
 Paswan also said the home guards never receive salary on time, adding that none from the government side has approached them for a dialogue.
