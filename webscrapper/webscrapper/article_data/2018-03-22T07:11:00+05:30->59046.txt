LUDHIANA: With the onset of summer,   are reminded of the poor state of overhead water tanks in the city, and have decided to get 20 such tanks repaired. In some areas, low water pressure troubles residents in summer when the demand for water increases, and overhead reservoirs create further pressure for water supply.

 In this regard, a meeting was conducted by civic officials on Tuesday, where they asked the staff concerned to get the tanks repaired as soon as possible, so that they could use them. Officials also discussed the problem of tracing owners of vacant plots in areas where water supply lines have been laid under the Amrut (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) scheme, but since owners are not available, officials are unable to give connections to the plots.
 
 To solve this problem, officials have decided to write a letter to the MCâ€™s building branch with a request to note down the details of these plots, and in future when the owners come for building plan approval, then the charges would be recovered from them. MC superintending engineer   confirmed the move and said they would get reservoirs repaired, so that water supply should not become a problem in summer.
