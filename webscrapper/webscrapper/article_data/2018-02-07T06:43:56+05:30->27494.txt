CHENNAI: Expelled AIADMK member   will file her affidavit with the   only after she is provided with all the evidence pertaining to the deposition by other witnesses, her counsel submitted to the commission on Tuesday. 

 This follows the commission's ruling that Sasikala would be entitled to all documents before she could file her affidavit. However, the commission has only given her the   and not the evidence, the counsel said. Sasikala's counsel said she would file her affidavit 10 days after the evidence was given. 
 
 The counsel also said the panel's observations that Sasikala was trying to delay proceedings by wanting to cross question witnesses should be withdrawn. The judge had made these observations in the order which directed the commission to give the documents to Sasikala. Her counsel would   only after the entire proceedings of the commission was over.
