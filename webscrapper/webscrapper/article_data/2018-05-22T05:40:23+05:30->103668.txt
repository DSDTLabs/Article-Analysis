MUMBAI: Commuters on board a CSMT-Belapur local train were in a tizzy as the train took the wrong route on Monday evening. After the train had pulled out of   station, it moved towards   instead of heading in the direction of  .

 
 The Central Railway’s Harbour line services run on two corridors. From CSMT, the common stretch for these two routes is up to Wadala, beyond which the routes bifurcate—while one goes west up to   station, the other goes southwards towards Panvel. The train in question was to move from Wadala towards Panvel, but it ended up taking the western route instead.
 
 A Central Railway official said that the stationmaster at Wadala had set the track for the western route. As soon as the gaffe came to light, the motorman braked and raised an alert.
 
 “Passengers who were on the train were then de-boarded at King’s Circle which is the next station. The empty train was was then taken to Bandra station as the reversal facility, after Wadala, is available only at Bandra,” said the official.
