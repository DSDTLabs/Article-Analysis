 A K Srivastava, head of the weather forecasting agency’s climate monitoring and analysis group in Pune, said, “The presence of moisture along with a system developed over central Maharashtra created a conducive situation for rainfall. The city along with central Maharashtra will receive thunder and light spell of rains on Monday as well.”
 
 Most parts of the city including Pashan, Panchavati, Baner, Sus Road, Kothrud and Shivajinagar, among others, received moderate rainfall accompanied by thunder and lightning. Overcast conditions gave way to the showers around 4pm and a light drizzle persisted for the next two hours. Humidity levels too fluctuated.
 
 “An existing low pressure system lying between Lakshadweep and South Central Maharashtra caused this weather. Apart from Pune, Kolhapur recorded 13mm rainfall,” he said. The official said the system also affected hot weather conditions as the maximum temperature dipped towards the end of the week.
