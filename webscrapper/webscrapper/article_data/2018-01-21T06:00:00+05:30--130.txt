Known for giving unforgettable experiences to his audience every time he takes the stage, tabla maestro Ustad   Hussian, who was in concert in Hyderabad after years on Friday, put up yet another splendid show. Performing to a packed  , the   artiste was on song from the word go making his tabla ‘speak, sing and at times, roar’ throughout the recital. 
The maestro who teamed up with talented sitar player   for this special, was welcomed on stage with a standing ovation. And once the duo began, it was magic through and through. Their precision, on-stage chemistry and mutual respect won over the audience and applauses kept pouring throughout the evening. While Zakir’s gift of gab kept the audience engaged in between pieces, Niladri made sure his sitar did all the talking.
 It was an intense concert, but thanks to Zakir’s jovial mood, the crowd also got to enjoy some lighthearted moments in between. For instance, the legendary artiste had just finished playing an incredible laggi (a fast style of playing) when someone from the audience shouted ‘Wah Ustad’ in appreciation. To which, Zakir, a veteran in stage antics, quickly responded saying, “Arre huzoor, wah taj, boliye,” sending everybody into peals of laughter. Again, when Niladri was busy tuning his sitar, Zakir politely offered him the tabla hammer, cracking up all. 
 Jokes and banter aside, it was a concert par excellence as both the musicians took turns to showcase their mastery over their respective instruments. The hour-long performance ended with Niladri taking the lead with a melody. The piece had a tinge of fusion to it, which was accentuated by Zakir’s choice of different percussion instruments. By the time they finished the recital, the entire auditorium was up on its feet applauding their remarkable musicianship as if to say, ‘thank you for the sonorous treat’.
