NAVI MUMBAI: The   police recovered a body from the Uran   near Kala Dhonda village, around 1km from   on Thursday evening. 

 The victim has been identified as Lakshman Gharat, 48, a resident of Dongri village. The cops have, prima facie, registered a   case against an unidentified person, as there was a nylon rope tied around Gharat’s neck and several injuries on his torso made by some sharp weapon.
 
 The complaint was lodged by his relative Janardhan Gharat, 43. The cops said that Gharat left home around 11 am on Thursday to go to a bank but he did not return home till 7pm. The family members searched for him but in vain. 
 
 As they were about to lodge a missing person complaint, the Uran police recovered his body from the creek, after a passer-by spotted it.
 
 DCP (zone-2) Rajendra Mane said that the victim had told his family that he was going to the bank to withdraw cash but there was no transaction in his account. 
 
 “It is yet to be ascertained whether he actually went to the bank or was killed mid-way. It seems like he was murdered over some previous enmity,” Mane added.
