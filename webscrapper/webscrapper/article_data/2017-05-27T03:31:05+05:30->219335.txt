Kanyakumari: An advocate from Kanyakumari district was arrested on charges of attempting to kill his newborn girl baby. Police said, the lawyer practising at the Eraniel court in the district, already has two daughters and was expecting a male child when his wife conceived. 

 However, to his dismay, his wife delivered a girl child. Frustrated by this, he attempted to kill the newborn within hours after the delivery.
 
 The accused was identified as Robinson, 35, from Ethavilai near Mekkamandapam, 18km away from Colachel. He was practising in the principal district munsif-cum-judicial magistrate court. Robinson had Mary Pierla few years ago. Since the couple already had two daughters Robinson was persistent on having a male child. 
 
 Few days ago, a pregnant Pierla was admitted to a private maternity hospital. She gave birth to a healthy baby girl on Thursday. Even as the mother was being provided treatment post delivery, the baby was taken out of the labour room and shown to the relatives, who had gathered there. Robinson took the child from the relatives after some time and walked away. 
 
 While the relatives thought that Robinson and his daughter should be around, he went to a separate room in the hospital and attempted to kill the baby. 
 
 Police said a trainee nurse in the hospital, who entered the room to check the screams, saw him trying to smother the child with a towel. She immediately stopped him and brought the issue to the knowledge of the hospital management, who in turn called the police. 
 
 Based on a complaint, Colachel police who conducted inquiries registered a case under section IPC 307- attempt to murder and arrested Robinson.
