MUMBAI: The police have arrested two men from Jalandhar for trying to fly to   via the city illegally with double visas. The arrest of the two, Prit Pal (25) and Kishan Singh (25), led to the arrest of an agent, Vajendra Singh (30), who helped them get the two visas — work as well as tourist — for Rs 65,000 each.

 Investigators said double   frauds are generally committed by people who apply for a labourer’s job in order to skip the long process involved.
 
 The Jalandhar men were caught during immigration check on Saturday. “On suspicion the two were thoroughly checked and the immigration officials found two visas. Officials got suspicious after looking at the duo’s attire and their claim that they were visiting Jordan as tourists. They broke down during questioning after finding found discrepancies in their statements,” Sahar police station senior inspector BT Mukhedkar said.
 
 The agent claimed he had received help from another agent for the double visas, said investigators.
