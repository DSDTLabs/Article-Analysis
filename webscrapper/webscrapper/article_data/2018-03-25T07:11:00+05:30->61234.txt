Ludhiana: In a shocking incident, a teacher of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Khanna, died after being hit by a bus near Malerkotla road on Saturday morning. The teacher was identified as Sunita Rani (57) of Birla Estate in Khanna.

 The teacher’s husband, Shiv Kumar — who works as a vocational master in Government Senior Secondary School in Payal — said his wife was working as a Social Science teacher at Dhamote since 2013, and about one-and-a-half months ago was posted on a temporary basis at the Government Senior Secondary School (Girls) in Khanna. He added that on Saturday morning, he dropped her near the Jarg Chowk, and she was to take an autorickshaw from there to her school.
 
 He added that as she was crossing the road, a bus coming from Ludhiana and going towards Patiala near the Malerkotla road hit her after trying to avoid collision with a car. He added that later, he got a call from his daughter about the accident. Police officials said an onlooker took Sunita to the neighbouring Civil Hospital, where she was declared ‘brought dead’. They added that after the accident, the bus driver was stopped by the police.
 
 Investigating officer (IO) of the case, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Shamsher Singh said the accused had been booked under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304-A (causing death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He added that the accused bus driver Amarjeet Singh of Dhamote had run away from the spot, but was arrested some distance away. The IO said the vehicle had been seized and was parked at a police station.
 
 Shiv Kumar said he had two daughters, one of whom was appearing in the class X examination, while the elder one was a B.Tech in Computers.
