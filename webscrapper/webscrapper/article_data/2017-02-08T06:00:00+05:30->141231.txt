Visakhapatnam: The factories department is proposing to establish industrial emergency response centres in industrial clusters with the support of managements. The aim of this move is to help in monitoring safety compliance in factories, said director of factories G Bala Kishore. He said these centres can also be used for interactive meetings and training programmes and to discuss issues related to occupation safety, health and accidents. Participating in a two-day workshop on “Safety excellence for business sustenance in API (active pharmaceutical ingredients) industry” organised jointly by the factories department and National Safety Council, AP Chapter, in the city on Tuesday, Kishore said the factories department is spreading safety culture by actively involving managements and workers of various industries to avoid accidents.  Stating that accidents mainly occur due to systems failure and human error, Kishore stressed on implementing a total safety management system including designing for safety and accident prevention.  He further elaborated that human error is a major contributing error in most of the accidents, which depends mainly on the attitude of the personnel. He explained that the department is focusing on safety education by way of training programmes. Persuasion, motivation and finally penalisation as a last resort, is the approach of the department towards prevention of accidents, he said. He said self discipline among management and workers is key to achieving zero accident rate. He urged the industries to improve the systems and equipments so as to reduce mishaps. After bifurcation, AP particularly Visakhapatnam has emerged as a largest industrial and pharma hub and their focus is on remaining on high alert in Visakhapatnam.
