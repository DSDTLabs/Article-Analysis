PARIS: The story of a lucky loser spot in the main draw of the French Open ironically ended on a sour note for India No.3   on Sunday.

 
 The big-serving Indian, who had lost in the final round of the qualifying competition to Sweden’s   on Friday, could’ve been the eighth lucky loser to make the   main draw had he stuck around in Paris for another week. So close, yet so far. After bowing out of the qualifying competition Gunneswaran decided to play the 50,000 ATP Challenger in Vicenza, where he made the main draw automatically.
 
 The ‘one tournament per week rule’ came into play ruling out the Indian, tournament referee Yan Kuszak explained. There is an exception to the rule, which may have worked had Gunneswaran entered in the qualifying draw in Italy. In which case the supervisor could’ve resolved the conflict by fining the player before releasing him.
 
 The Chennai-based pro, who flew to Vicenza on Sunday afternoon, was extremely disappointed. “This is a difficult situation to be in. I spoke to a number of people before taking this decision and they all told me that my chance of getting in was nil,” he told TOI on the phone. “I mean what are the chances of eight players pulling out of a Grand Slam? It doesn’t help that my phone is blowing up with messages with people telling me that I shouldn’t have made this decision, I should’ve stayed. I have no choice now, but to live with it.”
 
 “I plan on working hard and earning my place in the main draw. I am confident I’ll get there one day,” he said.
 
 Gunneswaran is scheduled to play Italian Salvatore Caruso, who he beat in the first round of the Roland Garros qualifiers, next in Italy, likely on Tuesday.
 
 Meanwhile, in a scenario that is fast-developing into a Bollywood movie script, Argentina’s Marco Trungelliti, who could be the eighth lucky loser through the door, is driving down from Barcelona to take Nick Kyrgios’ place opposite Aussie Bernard Tomic on Monday. More on that after interval.
