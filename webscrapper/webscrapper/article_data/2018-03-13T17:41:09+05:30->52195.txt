  The culmination of the three-act play was Naseeruddin Shah himself performing a comedy named Gharwali, which dealt with the intricacies of a middle-aged man torn between whether he should keep his maid as a paramour or wife. “These plays are not plays but stories,” he said about the performance, adding, “We have tried to be as truthful to Ismat Apa’s tales as possible. We have even used the same Urdu language she wrote in.” Despite the chaste Urdu, the play was watched by a packed house at the auditorium, who responded with a standing ovation at the end, prompting Naseeruddin to say, “Thanks for being a wonderful audience. We promise to return here next year.”
