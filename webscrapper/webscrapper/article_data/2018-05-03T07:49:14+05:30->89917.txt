LUCKNOW: CCTV cameras will keep a close watch on commuters violating traffic norms in the city. The traffic police, in co-ordination with the police control room called Drishti, has implemented the system at five major crossings of the city.

 
  
  
 
 On Tuesday, the operations began at three crossings—Hazratganj, Bara Birwa and Tedhipulia. On Wednesday, two more crossings —Kaiserbagh and Engineering College—were added.
 
 The cameras will keep a watch on over-speeding, black films in cars, driving without helmet or seatbelt, overstepping zebra crossing and those not following signals. It will also help determine who was responsible in caseof an accident and penalise them.
 
 ASP (traffic) RS Nim said, “We have begun work on five crossings. We will add more after a trial run of 15 days. The plan has to be implemented at 70 major crossings in the city. For this, 280 CCTV cameras will be linked with a dedicated line to16 screens in the police control room.”
 
 A total of 24 personnel will monitor these screens. They will work 24 hours in shifts of eight hours each.
 
 He also said that in a span of one week, more constables will be assigned duty in the traffic department. They will be trained and deployed to man crossings.
 
 The scheme was also launched in 2015-16, but could not be implemented across the city. It was aborted soon after.
 
 To a question on this, Nim replied that construction work for the   rail had created hindrances in the installation at the time as several roads were dug up. It was a technical challenge to connect CCTVs with a single dedicated line to the control room. Another reason was the lack of manpower, he said.
