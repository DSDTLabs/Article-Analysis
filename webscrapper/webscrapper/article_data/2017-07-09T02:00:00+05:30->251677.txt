PATNA: The   will soon have a rhinoceros breeding and conservation centre.

 Sources said the zoo has received Rs 3.5 crore for the project from the Central   (CZA) and the state government for the purpose. The conservation centre will have three separate enclosures, including a night house, a shaded area and an open area. To be located separately from the rhino enclosure in the zoo, the five-hectare conservation centre will not be open to the public.
 
 “We intend to provide a healthy atmosphere for the breeding rhinos as it is one of the endangered species in India,” said Patna zoo director Nand Kishore. The zoo, as of now, has ten rhinos, including five males. 
 
 The CZA has identified the one-horned rhinoceros among 26 priority species for conservation and breeding purposes. The other two zoological parks to be covered under the conservation and breeding initiative are the   in New Delhi and the Kanpur zoo.
