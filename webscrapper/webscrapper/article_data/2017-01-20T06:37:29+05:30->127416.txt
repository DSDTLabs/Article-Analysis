NAGPUR: Nagpur bench of   on Thursday directed Maharashtra government to add Nagpur collector as a respondent in PIL against   (VCA). The move comes after VCA’s counsel raised objection over remaining dues of about Rs1.45 crore to be paid to the police towards providing security during several international matches played at VCA’s Jamtha stadium during last six to seven years.

 VCA’s counsel   stated they had already deposited Rs3.20 crore with Maharashtra police towards part of its dues and only Rs37 lakh remained, which they would hand over next week. He stated cops were demanding “exorbitant” charges towards security.
 
 A bench of Justice Bhushan Gavai and Justice Atul Chandurkar then directed the assistant government pleader to add collector as a party. He was told to file a detailed affidavit on charges to be recovered from VCA within a week.
 
 PIL was filed by social worker Paramjeet Singh Kalsi through counsel Harnish Gadhia seeking directives to the cricket association to pay security dues immediately. During last hearing on November 28, the court had issued notices to   ( ) and superintendent of police, Nagpur rural, besides VCA.
 
 Gadhia strongly argued that even though it’s a matter between two parties, it is ultimately causing a loss to state exchequer. He pointed out law and order was a matter of great importance especially in events such as cricket match that drew people in large numbers. It was contended that an ordinary man needed to make payment in advance to avail any such service. However, in this case dues amounting to crores were yet to be recovered, he contended.
