KOCHI: The purpose of Utsav 2018, the annual folk art festival of the state, was well-served on the inaugural day of the fest here, with   and Neerav - a couple from Canada who chose their names out of love for the Indian cultures and its vibes - chancing upon the folk performance at   on Saturday. 

 The couple who have been travelling to India every year for around a decade now, got a chance to watch the folk arts of Kerala for the first time.
 
 "Every year we come around February, and we never have come across this celebration of the folk tradition of the state. This time somehow we landed up in Kerala on the right time it seems, and are eager to watch the arts unique to this place," Narayani, who along with Neerav joined to light the inaugural lamp of the event.
 
  MLA, inaugurating the event, said, "These art forms which are celebrated at Utsav 2018 concurrently across the 14 districts for a week, were the part and parcel of the festivities in earlier times. Folk Art Festival is an attempt to bring back to the fore these artforms which lost its sheen over the years due to various reasons - be it the lack of artists to continue the practice or the public in general becoming oblivious to it - by honouring the artists who still stick to their art and by presenting it to our society, so that our people as well as the tourists could revisit the culture of our lands." Surendran Panikkar, a Ninabali artist and  , a Mayoora nritham artist were honoured with ponnaada by Fernandez on behalf of Kerala tourism department.
 
 On the first day of the festival, Ninabali, Darika Vadham and Mayoora nritham were performed at Durbar Hall Ground, while at Vasco da Gama Square, Fort Kochi, Thiriyuzhichil, Pulluvanpaatt and Padayani were staged.
