CHANDIGARH: The UT administration seems little interested in exploring new options when it comes to selecting a theme for its tableau to be showcased at the 2018 Republic Day Parade at Rajpath in New Delhi.

 After failing to conceptualise a theme for the tableau in 2017, the authorities have gone back to the tired and tested option: works of  , the French master architect of the city. Authorities have, again, decided to showcase Capitol Complex, which has been in news globally for the past one and a half years.
 
 In 2016, then France President, Francois Hollande, and India Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited the Capitol Complex. Five months later, the complex played host to around 30,000 people, who performed yoga asanas on International Yoga Day, led by Modi.
 
 Capitol Complex was declared a Unesco World Heritage site on July 17 last year. After the UT administration made unsuccessful attempts to get the Unesco tag for it since 2006, the complex was included in the transnational dossier on the works of Le Corbusier, submitted by Paris-based Fondation Le Corbusier to Unesco on behalf of seven countries, including France, Argentina, Japan, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany.
 
 Talking to TOI, UT home secretary   said Capitol Complex had gained international attention last year. “At the Republic Day Parade, we will showcase the architecture heritage of Capitol Complex,” Agarwal said.
