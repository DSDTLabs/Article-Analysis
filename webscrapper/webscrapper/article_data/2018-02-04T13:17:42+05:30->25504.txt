BHUBANESWAR: Children of most government schools spent a Saturday with a difference as many extra-curricular activities were organised for them. 

 The main objective behind turning Saturdays into fun days was to attract children to school. 
 
 On Saturdays, school's witness very thin attendance compared to other days of the week. 
 
 "To attract students to school on the weekend, the government decided to make learning more joyful through various activities," said a senior officer of Bhubaneswar  . 
 
 Children enjoyed extra-curricular activities like dance, music, drawing, fancy dress and sports. Students from Class I to III need not bring any book to school on Saturday. "During the week days children don't get enough time for extra-curricular activities. The day is meant for complete relaxation and   as there will be no time limit or periods," said block education officer  . 
 
 The initiative has been started in 19 schools in Bhubaneswar block in the first phase and will be replicated in other schools later.
 
  "We don't feel like going to school a day before Sunday. But we enjoyed a lot in school today and it was loads of fun with no studies. If this will happen every Saturday we will never stay home," said Sukant Behera, a student of Government Project UP School, Unit-VI.
