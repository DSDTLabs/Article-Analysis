HYDERABAD: The Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL) is set to lose a large chunk of land as part of road widening for the proposed flyover between Balanagar junction and Shobhana Theatre X Roads under the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP). The   is located at Balanagar X Road-Narsapur X Road. It will lose 1.3 acres of prime property.

 In fact, this is the only government   which will lose a major chunk of land in the SRDP project. Officials of the   ( ), Kukatpally circle, have already served land acquisition notices on the management of the IDPL. Road widening is likely to begin in February.
 
 Other central government units like the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises located at Balanagar will also be affected. The MSME is running a training institute for entrepreneurs. According to GHMC town planning records, the MSME will lose 3,840 sq yards. The National Remote Sensing Centre and the   (HAL), the office of assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Balanagar division, and Balanagar police station will also lose land.
 
  
 “About two months ago, GHMC officials served notices on land acquisition. Government agencies will lose their open land parcels. No structure will be razed down,” a senior GHMC official said.
 
 Some of the property owners had agreed to part with their land parcels. GHMC officials have agreed to provide water and sewer connections on their own and build compound walls with civic body funds. The proposed flyover will run for 1.9 km.
 
 The civic body has agreed to pay compensation to affected parties as per government rates.
 
 About 400 commercial establishments will also be hit by the flyover. A little over 50 per cent of shop owners had agreed to part with the land. The civic body is now busy convincing the rest of the land owners. The residents want the road to be widened to 150 ft instead of the proposed 200 ft.
