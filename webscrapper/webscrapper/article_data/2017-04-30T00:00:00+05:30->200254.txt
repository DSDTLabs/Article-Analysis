Here's how to avoid getting   patches on your favourite clothes:

 
  Everyone sweats. So, everyone gets those dark, yellow patches. But there’s a way to avoid them, and that’s exactly why you’re here... 
 
 
 : A lot of us wear vests. But a lot of us don’t, because they are not cool anymore. A vest does the heavy work in soaking up the sweat, saving your top layering piece. You can also use underarm pads, available at any local pharmacy.
 
 
 : Fabrics like cotton, linen, voile etc. are your best bets for the summer. Avoid nylon, rayon and silk. 
 
 
 : You don’t need an expensive antiperspirant. Any of the drugstore buys will do. Grab one and use twice, daily, especially immediately after your morning shower. Remember to dry your armpit skin before applying. Spraying on wet surfaces will do no good.
 
 : If athletic wear is your everyday choice, you are aware of what we are talking about here. Cutting-edge technology now prevents excessive   or ensures quick absorption of sweat. Go to a sports store and pick up some performance wear.
 
 
 : Darker shades on the colour wheel will have less visible stains, while greys, blues and bright hues will highlight them. While venturing out in the sun, pick colours that won’t embrace sweat stains.
