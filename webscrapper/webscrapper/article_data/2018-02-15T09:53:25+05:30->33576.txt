KOLHAPUR: The   (permanently) Unaided Schools Action Committee has decided to boycott assessment of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) answer sheets.

 The HSC and SSC examinations are starting from February 21 and March 4, respectively.
 
 In a statement to the media, vice-president of the action committee   said that the state government has failed to take any step regarding their pending demands and they have no choice but to boycott.
 
 “We met with the Kolhapur divisional board officials on Wednesday and have intimated them about the boycott of paper assessment in coming days. We have been consistently mocked by the state government over our demands. Despite approving the 20% grant step-by-step to the eligible schools, we have been paid nothing,” he said.
 
 He added that there are over 40,000 teachers associated with the committee across the state and the decision was unanimous.
 
 “We are not holding anyone to ransom. This is our right and we stand by it. The education minister, when we met last week, said that the state government has no money and the issue will to be looked into after the next monsoon session. This is not acceptable,”   said.
 
 According to him, they have been even told by government officials that their non-cooperation will not have any effect.
 
 “We would like to let them see how it unfolds. Without proper reinforcement it is not easy to assess the answer sheets. The government will see this in coming days,” Jagdale said.
