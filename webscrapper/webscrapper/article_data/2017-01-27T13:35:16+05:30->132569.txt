Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma is no stranger to voicing his opinion on social media, on topics ranging from films to politics. Recently, the filmmaker was hot on Chiranjeevi and Ram Charan's tail, bashing them for their film 'Khaidi No 150'. This time around it was actor Mahesh Babu found himself at the receiving end of RGV's tweets, for supporting the people of Tamil Nadu during their protest to lift the ban on Jallikattu.
 
 
 
Taking to Twitter, RGV accused Mahesh of not caring enough for the people of Andhra Pradesh and even went as far as to call him a 'traitor', "Why @urstrulyMahesh supporting some Tamil festival culture more than survival problems of AP? Because he's not as caring as @PawanKalyan? Shocked @urstrulyMahesh is more bothered about dubbing market people than survival problems of actual people who made him a superstar. Any celebrity if they don't immediately join @PawanKalyan in his fight for the people's problems they are criminal traitors of AP. If @urstrulyMahesh fans don't tell him to back @PawanKalyan's fight for AP's struggle they also are as big traitors of AP as him." 
 
It remains to be seen if Mahesh Babu reacts to RGVâ€™s accusations.
