CHENNAI: The   probing the circumstances surrounding former CM J  's death is likely to summon more police officers to depose before it. 

 On Monday the panel requested the government to provide an official in front of whom the cops can depose and who in turn can submit the documents to it.
 
 The panel has summoned Jayalalithaa's personal security officer ADSP Veeraperumal to appear before the commission on Tuesday. 
 
 This is after an affidavit submitted by VK Sasikala, Jaya's close aide, stating the PSO was one of the persons who had seen Jaya in   during the period of her treatment in 2016, as per sources who were privy to the affidavit.
 
 Seven government doctors Dr Vimala, Dr Narayanababu, Dr Kala, Dr Muthuselvan, Dr Tito, Dr Dharmarajan and Dr P Balaji are set to appear before the commission on Wednesday for cross-examination by Sasikala's legal counsel.
