It was an eventful Monday morning for the   members as they turned up in droves to showcase their prized possessions — vintage cars and pets. The event saw some proud owners of rare beauties such as 1930  , 1934 Austin 7 Tourer, 1938  , 1933   Ballila and 1926 Auburn, among others. We also spotted supercars like a   and a Mercedes. Everyone was seen posing for pretty pictures with these vintage cars and some even drove around the lush green lawns of the club. 
 
  
 The pet show that followed was equally fun. From canines like pugs, French mastiffs, golden retrievers, beagle, bichon frise to birds such as cockatoo and grey parrot, all decked up quirkily, had a gala time. They participated in various competitions such as jumping the fence, most lovable pet, most responsive pet and best dressed pet. Rashmi, a club member, said, “We look forward to this event every year since it’s a great way for the pets to socialise and take part in fun activities.”
