PUNE: An early onset of the   this year is on the cards, the  's ( ) forecast models indicate. The weather bureau had last month forecast a normal monsoon. 

 
 Though the official onset forecast by IMD is expected on Saturday, models run by the Met department show the monsoon's onset over   around May 25. The normal date is June 1. If the monsoon does hit Kerala on that date, it will be earliest monsoon onset in the last seven years. Forecast models show various onset criteria are likely to be fulfilled around that time, including a change in the wind direction and good rainfall over the southern tip of the country.
 
 Monsoon circulation generally starts from the second week of May with the wind direction gradually changing to westerly in the lower levels of the troposphere. 
 
 Weather models show that changes in the wind circulation pattern will become prominent between May 18 and May 24 over the Arabian Sea. The wind flow is expected to become more westerly in the period between May 25 and 31 over southeast Arabian Sea. Models also show that a good amount of rainfall is likely to occur in the Arabian Sea and the adjoining south peninsula not only in the May 11 to May 17 period but also in the May 18 to May 24 time frame.
