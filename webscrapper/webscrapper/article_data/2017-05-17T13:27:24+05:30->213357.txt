Ajay Devgn said aspiring actors should be passionate about the craft and not chase stardom. "Whenever we go to small towns and interact with people they said they have wished to act since childhood and ask how one can go about it. But I question them, 'Do you want to be a star or an  ?'"

  
  
 "Some say they want to be star and I feel they can't do anything. If you are interested in acting, you've to learn it. Only then you will become a star," Ajay said.
 
 Ajay said aspiring actors do not have a platform to showcase their talent and the initiative will give them a stage. Suniel said many people come in the industry with dreams but often quit in the middle due to lack of opportunities 
 
 "There is no money required to be in this profession. It is hard work but the only thing which is required here is talent... There are so many who want to learn acting but very few to teach them," he said.
