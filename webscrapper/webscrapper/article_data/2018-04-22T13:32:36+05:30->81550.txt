PATNA: Patna Sahib MP   on Saturday dared   to take action against him for “speaking the truth” but warned it that every action has an equal and opposite reaction as per a Newton’s law.

 Addressing an ‘open convention’ of the National Forum in Patna on Saturday, the BJP senior said talks of action against him by the party have been doing the rounds for quite sometime. “Why are you not taking action?” he asked.
 
 Refuting rumours that he might quit the BJP like Forum founder Yashwant Sinha who announced quitting the party at the convention, Shatrughan asserted, “I am not quitting. The BJP is free to leave me. I firmly believe BJP is my first and last party.”
 
 The cine actor-turned-politician said people now say the Union government looks like a government of ‘Ali Baba and 40 thieves’. “They introduced the GST at the midnight and called it ‘one nation-one tax’. But it turned out to be ‘one nation-six taxes’ and later became ‘one nation-eight taxes’. It may become ‘one nation-40 taxes’,” he said.
 
 Praising jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who was also on the dais, Shatrughan said Lalu was his best friend and he had personal bonding with Lalu’s family for long. “Once a friend is always a friend. My party will not decide who will be my friend,” he said.
 
 “When I went to meet Lalu in jail, some people tried to scare me saying I too would be sent to jail for this. Well, if I am imprisoned, I would like to opt for a ward beside Lalu’s so that we two brothers can talk and laugh together,” he said amid laughter.
 
 Tejashwi,   said, is “a worthy son of a worthy father”. He also hailed Lalu as a mass leader. “My political experience says Tejashwi is the only face of  ,” he added.
