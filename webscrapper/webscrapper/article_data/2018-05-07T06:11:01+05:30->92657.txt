KOLKATA: The 15-year-old girl who was found dumped at the doorstep of an apartment complex in   has cried out a name, giving a possible lead to investigators. The girl is still incoherent and in a semi-conscious state, three days after she was found profusely bleeding from multiple wounds. Doctors feel she had been severely drugged before assaulted.

 On Sunday, police did not comment much on her inerrogation, but sources in her family said she had been taking aname even when they had been present. “Her condition has improved a bit, but she is still in trauma. When we went to meet her today, she suddenly started crying. While she was crying, she kept repeating a name,” said her aunt. “As she repeated the name, she continued to weep and complained of abdominal pain. We got afraid when she complained about pain. We did inquire further about the name she took,” the aunt added.
 
 “The girl has been largely incoherent when we attempted to speak to her. It seems like the sequence of events was getting jumbled up while she tried to recollect. She is coming up with something new every time,” said a cop.
 
 The girl’s uncle said the assailant could have been an outsider. “We do not suspect anyone residing in our area. She was friendly with some, but not much. Locals are helping us to zero in on the assailants,” he said.
 
 A doctor, part of the sixmember team treating the girl, sounded worried with her semi-conscious state. “What worries us is the drowsiness she is experiencing now. Given the nature of the injury, it should not have continued till now,” the doctor said. “It could be that the girl was drugged, which is why she is in a semi-conscious state even now. We could have been sure of the reason of such prolonged drowsiness had she been able to speak anything clearly,” the doctor added. “The girl has improved slightly.... We are monitoring her condition round the clock,” said Tapas Ghosh, superintendent, M R Bangur Hospital.
