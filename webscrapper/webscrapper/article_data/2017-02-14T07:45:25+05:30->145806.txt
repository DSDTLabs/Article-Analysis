PUNE: A 45-year-old labour contractor was killed after an iron rod fell on his head from the seventh floor of an   in   Phase-II on Saturday morning.

 The labour contractor, Rekhu Rathod of Hinjewadi, was wearing a head protecting gear. But it could not absorb the impact of the falling iron rod and he died, said sub-inspector P M Patil of the Hinjewadi police.
 
 The police have booked four persons — the builder, project manager, site engineer and the safety manager — under Section 304 (A) (causing death by negligence) of IPC.
 
 Patil said the accident occurred around 11am on Saturday. Rathod was on the ground floor when the iron rod, which was not properly tied on a structure on the seventh floor, fell. “The rod crashed on Rathod’s head at a high speed. Despite wearing the helmet, Rathod suffered severe head injuries,” he said.
 
 Patil said Rathod was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital, where he succumbed to head injuries. “Our probe is on. We are in the process of recording the statements. Thereafter, we shall arrest the suspects,” Patil said.
