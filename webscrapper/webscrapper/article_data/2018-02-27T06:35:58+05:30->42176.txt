MUMBAI: The 180 civic   awarded punishments for their involvement in the   will be given 30-60 days to contest the charges.

 According to   officials, while notices have been issued to engineers found involved in the first phase of the scam, they are still in the process of sending notices to engineers found guilty in the second phase.
 
 So far, two engineers from the 96 who were indicted in the first phase of the inquiry have appealed to the municipal commissioner. A senior BMC official said, “If punishment is of less serious nature like a fine, censure or stoppage of increment, the official needs to appeal against the order within 30 days. In case it’s a serious punishment like dismissal, the engineer has a 60-day period to appeal.” A deputy municipal commissioner has been appointed to conduct hearings. Last Friday, over two years after the road repair scam came to light, the BMC indicted 180 civic engineers, of which six were dismissed.
 
 Commenting on the probe panel report, municipal commissioner   had said, “Widespread connivance and negligence has led to poor quality roads, causing inconvenience to citizens.”
 
 According to the inquiry report, 185 engineers were under the scanner and 180 were found guilty.
 
 The first phase of the inquiry saw four engineers being dismissed and the second saw two. Punishment recommended for other engineers includes reduction in rank, reduction in pension, increment cut for a year, fines and censures. The irregularities in road works came to light in 2015.
