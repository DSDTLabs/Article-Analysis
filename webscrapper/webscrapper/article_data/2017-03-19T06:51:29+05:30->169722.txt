AHMEDABAD:   (I-T) department has sought details in the   against Waghodia-based Sumandeep Vidyapeeth to start a probe. State Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials said that it is for the first time that agencies such as   (ED) and   have joined in the probe in an   case.

 A senior I-T official said that the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials had informed them about some of the suspicious transactions and unaccounted income of Sumandeep University. “We will start a probe once we get the documents from ACB officials,” the I-T official said. 
 
 ACB had registered a complaint of graft against Mansukh Shah, founder chairman of the medical college and university, along with two other accused, Ashok Tailor and Vinod Sawant, in February after Tailor and Sawant had accepted Rs 20 lakh from parents of a final year MBBS student for allowing her to appear in examination. Subsequent raid at Shah’s office in the university had led to recovery of 220 cheques amounting Rs 101.57 crore, along with documents pertaining to Shah’s financial transactions. 
 
 The ED had joined in the probe when it was revealed that Sawant had sent some money to his son based in China through Vadodara-based foreign exchange firms. The I-T department will now probe the accounts of the university and the accused to ascertain whether any malpractice was involved.
