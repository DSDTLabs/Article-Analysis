CHANDIGARH: The   government has made the existing criminal laws related to sexual offences committed against women and children more stringent by deciding on the maximum sentence for those found guilty of raping girls aged up to 12 years. The cabinet, which met under the chairmanship of chief minister   on Tuesday, decided to amend laws like Sections 376-A, 376-D, 354 and 354-D (2) of the IPC. 

 According to a section inserted under Section 376-AA of the IPC, whoever commits rape of a girl upto 12 years of age will be punished with death or rigorous imprisonment for a term which will not be less than 14 years, but which may extend to imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s natural life and will also be liable to fine.
 
 
  
 
  Another provision made under Section 376-DA of the IPC, where a girl upto 12 years of age is raped by one or more persons constituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention, each of those persons shall be deemed to have committed the offence of rape and will be punished with death or rigorous imprisonment for a term not be less than 20 years. This may may extend to life which will mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s natural life and a fine. Such a fine shall be just and reasonable to meet the medical expenses and rehabilitation of the victim.
 
 Under Section 354 of the IPC, whoever assaults or uses criminal force on any woman, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term not to be less than two years and may extend up to seven years and shall also be liable to be fined.
 
 Also, under Section 354D (2) of the IPC, whoever commits the offence of stalking will be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine; and be punished on a second or subsequent conviction, with imprisonment of either description for a term which will not be less than three years. This may extend to seven years and he will also be liable to be fined.
