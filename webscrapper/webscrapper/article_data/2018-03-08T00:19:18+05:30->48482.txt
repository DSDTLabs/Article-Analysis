Guntur: Former minister and senior BJP leader Kanna Lakshminarayana came down heavily on the Naidu government, saying that it has shelled out Rs 10,000 per sq ft for the construction of interim secretariat, but the rate does not match with that in the United States. 

 The   leader asserted that it is not right for the TDP ministers to blame the Modi government as there has been discrepancy in the splurge of public money by the AP government itself on the contractors. 
 
 Kanna Lakshminarayana demanded that the state government reveal where the rate of constructing a makeshift structure is Rs 10,000 per sq ft. “It is shocking that the government claims to have paid the contractor such a huge amount of money, despite getting the land free. People in the state want to know where the money has gone,” he said.
 
 He added that Narendra Modi government has sanctioned 22 national institutes to the state in the last four years and allocated sufficient funds for the construction. Besides, power supply in the state day in and day out was possible due to the Modi government’s support. He also asked why Naidu had felicitated personally the vice-president and former Union minister Venkaiah Naidu when the state had been granted a special package. “It is Naidu’s inborn habit to change his own statements and actions,” he fumed.
