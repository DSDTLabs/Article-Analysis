Toral Rasputra, who took over from   to immortalise the character of Anandi in ' ', is back in action. She is all set to mark her debut in theatre with Sanjay Jha’s 'I Love You Two'. 
About the difference between theatre and television, Toral observes, “TV is easy when compared to theatre. On television, you have the luxury of giving retakes, but in theatre, you are performing live.” 
 Interestingly, Toral will tickle your funny bone on stage. “Unlike Anandi, I won’t be crying all the time. The audience will get to see a different side of me,” she says. The play will also see her reuniting with her 'Balika Vadhu' co-actor  . “He was shown to have feelings for me in the show. Now, I will play his wife,” Toral lets in.
