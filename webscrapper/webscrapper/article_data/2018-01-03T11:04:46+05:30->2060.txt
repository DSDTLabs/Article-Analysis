JAIPUR: After the Centre gave its nod for a   probe into the   encounter case last week, the Department of personnel and training (DoPT) has issued a notification officially handing over three FIRs pertaining to the gangster’s death in Churu, the ensuing violent protests in Sanvard in   and death of one Surender Singh in an alleged police firing during the clashes.

 On December 22, the DoPT had sent a letter to the state government to announce that it has agreed for the CBI probe recommended by the home department on December 17. The letter, however, had mentioned only two FIRs.
 
 “This indicates that CBI has agreed to probe three cases- death of gangster in an alleged encounter in Churu on June 24, the death of   in a firing at Sanvarad on July 12 and the violent clashes that erupted there,” an official stated. The sources said that CBI in coming days will file an FIR in this case to initiate its probe.
 
 The Rajasthan government on July 17 had agreed for a CBI probe after talking to Rajput leaders who had been demanding an independent probe into the gangster's encounter which they claimed was staged. The state government, on its part, conceded to the demand but added a caveat, as it handed over two cases - Anandpal's death on June 24 and death of Surendra Singh in violence at Sanvarad on July 12 to CBI
