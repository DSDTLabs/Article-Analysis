 is going all out for his Mollywood directorial debut  , which has   in the lead. The filmmaker had earlier told us that the movie would have five actresses with model Arthi Venkatesh and Ann Augustine shooting for the first schedule of the movie.

 A source close to the director now reveals that the Wazir filmmaker has now gathered a stellar cast comprising actress Sruthi Hariharan, Marathi actress Sai Tamahankar, Asha Jairam along with Manoj K Jayan, Prakash Belawadi and filmmaker Quashiq Mukherjee, popularly known as Q.
 
 The movie would mark the comeback of Sruthi, who had debuted in Mollywood with Cinema Company in 2012. “I have been a fan of Bejoy’s movies,” she says. “I had to audition for the part in Solo and when they offered me the role, I was elated. Also, to get back to Malayalam with a Dulquer movie is something I looking forward to eagerly.”
 Meanwhile, the source tells us that Airlift actor Prakash Belawadi, who will also be seen in Kunchacko Boban’s Take Off, has an important character in the film. “He had acted in the first play Bejoy had directed, so he had no qualms casting him Prakash for this role,” says the source.
 
 Incidentally, the film will also have Thaikkudam Bridge’s Govind Menon and Siddharth Menon acting as well as composing the music. Govind, who would make his acting debut with Solo, says, “I initially thought it was just a music gig but Bejoy insisted we act too. I am close to him so that’s why I took up the role. But I consider it a one-off thing. I don’t intend to make a career out of acting.” The duo will play the members of a music band in the film.
 
 When we reached out to the director, apart from confirming the cast, Bejoy was tight-lipped about the rest. “I cannot reveal anything about the movie except that it belongs to multiple genres,” he says, adding that the second schedule will begin in Kochi next week.
