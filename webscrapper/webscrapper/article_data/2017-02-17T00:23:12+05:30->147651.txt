Around 6 on a festive October evening in  , Lal Chand Saluja, owner of the hugely popular Shyam Juice Corner in Sarojini Nagar Market, spotted an unattended bag near his stall. He picked up the bag and handed it to Ram Jeevan, one of his employees. A few seconds later, Saluja, Jeevan and a third employee, Babloo, were blown to bits in what still remains one of the worst terror attacks in Delhi.

 Kiran Saluja, Lal Chand’s wife, had wanted the terrorists involved to be hanged to death, though the courts proved more lenient on Thursday. "Our entire world was shattered by that blast," she says.
 
 Two hours after saying no to her husband who had asked her to come to the market that day, Kiran’s calls to him rang on endlessly. "My jeth (son-in-law) went to Sarojini Nagar and confirmed his death later in the night," she says.
 
 Kiran did not even have time to grieve as she suddenly found herself a single parent to two kids. After the terahvi ceremony for her husband, she stoicly resumed the juice business. "We received a compensation of Rs 50,000 for the shop, and I had to get the shop repaired and equipped with new machines," she says. In the 12 years since, she says, she has faced frequent harassment from the civic authorities, perhaps because she is the sole woman running a shop there.
 
 "When I started, I did not even know how to quickly count the currency notes," she admits, narrating how she had to learn the business from scratch. Her son and daughter too required attention, but receiving no help from her extended family, she was forced to send them to boarding schools in Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh. Nirmit and Karuna are now in Class IX.
 
 She has people to manage the shop now, but insists "daily attendance is must". She normally leaves for Sarojini Nagar only in the late afternoon when the children are home for holidays. "They ask me about their papa and what sort of a man he was," she says. "My son has grown up to be a copy of him, a gentle person."
