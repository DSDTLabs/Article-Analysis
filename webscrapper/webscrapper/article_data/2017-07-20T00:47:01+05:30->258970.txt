Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday stayed a single judge’s order remitting back to the government a plea of Pepsi’s co-packer company seeking   in Trichy. The single judge had passed the order on April 26 on the petition filed by LA Bottlers Private Ltd managing director Joseph Francis. 

 Challenging the order,   Vivasayigal Pathukappu Sangam president T Ramaraj filed an appeal which came up for hearing before the division bench of justices M M Sundresh and N Sathishkumar. The appellant’s counsel T Lajapathi Roy said that the company had started its business activities in Suriyur village which was a mixed residential zone. 
 
 To start an industrial unit, the land needed to be reclassified as industrial zone. The villagers brought the issue to the notice of the government which stopped the activity of the company following protests. 
 
 Seeking reclassification of land, the company approached the housing and urban development principal secretary who in turn rejected its request. Challenging it, the company filed a petition before the high court which on April 26 passed an order remitting back the matter to the authority for fresh consideration. 
 
 Reclassification of the land was the discretion of the government which had already rejected the company’s plea seeking it. Besides, there was a batch of petitions regarding the company in Suriyur village which were pending adjudication. 
 
 The single judge should have considered all those facts, but failed to do so. Following it, the bench granted stay on the order and ordered notice to the company and the government.
