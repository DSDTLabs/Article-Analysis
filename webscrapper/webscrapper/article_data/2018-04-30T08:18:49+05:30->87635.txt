HUBBALLI: While the candidates of various   in   are  , they are unable to reach each and every voter. Hence, they have roped in their family members to reach the electorate, especially women. 

 The family members of BJP candidate and former CM Jagadish Shettar, Congress candidate Dr Mahesh Nalwad and JD(S) candidate Rajanna Koravi are campaigning aggressively as just less than two weeks are left for the polling day. 
 
 Beginning their day at 7am, family members including women and children are requesting people to vote for the candidates. They are hearing the grievances of voters and explaining them the achievements of the leaders. Accompanied by party workers family members are visiting households. They are also holding small meetings of voters in many wards. 
 
 Sharing their experience of canvassing, family members of candidates said that canvassing has given them a unique experience besides understanding the ground reality. 
 
 "People are waiting for a change this time. They are highlighting the problems pertaining to garbage, road and water," said Sugandha Nalwad, the wife of Mahesh Nalwad.
 
 Shilpa Shettar, wife of Jagadish Shettar, said that she completed campaigning in many wards. Shettar's children, daughter-in-law, brothers and sisters are campaigning till 9pm every day. "The response from people is overwhelming," she said.
 
 Savita Deekshit, sister of Rajanna Koravi, said over 25 family members and about 100 supporters set out for campaigning in the wee hours. "My brother is enjoying a lot of support in the constituency. I am sure he will win," she added.
 
 "The constituency lacks proper roads. Those who come to power should concentrate on improving infrastructure in the constituency. While campaigning by the family members is welcoming, they should also shoulder responsibility of solving these problems if the candidate wins," said Sangeeta Deshpande, a student.
