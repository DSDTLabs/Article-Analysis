Pimpri Chinchwad: The civic bodyâ€™s medical department has appointed two agencies for different zones to manage doorstep waste collection for eight years. 

 The agencies, BVG India, and A G Enviro Infra Projects, will dump the trash at Moshi garbage depot, encourage decentralized processing, operate and maintain five metric tonnes of green waste at select gardens, and create awareness about garbage segregation. Around 850 tonnes of garbage is generated every day. Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar has approved the proposal.
 
 The agencies will have to prepare a solid waste management plan within six months according to the solid waste management rules 2016 and undertake pilot case studies on waste reuse, recycle, diversion and decentralized waste processing. 
 
 They have to implement a vehicle tracking system for all waste management vehicles, civic officials said. The agencies will have to segregate garbage at the Moshi garbage depot. After processing of wet waste, the agencies will have to minimize garbage segregation. Incentives will be given from 20% to 50% to maximize garbage collection for eight years, officials said. The door-to-door garbage collection will be from 386 tonnes per day to 506 tonnes per day.
 
 Meanwhile, the civic body will undertake hanging litter bins for five years under the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan. Under the mission, the corporation will create environment friendly public awareness boards, and social media promotion across the city.
