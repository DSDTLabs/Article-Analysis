AGRA: Lashing out at senior   leader   over his   opinion and comments,   S P Singh Baghel on Monday asserted that former minister likes to be in headlines.
 
  “Khan likes to be in headlines, his comment on sensitive issue like triple talaq is disappointing and unfortunate,” said minister who was on a day visit to Agra, to meet the right wing men arrested for alleged attack on cops and stone pelting at Sadar and Fatehpur Sikri police stations.
  
  Alleging about brutality by Agra police, minister said, “The right wing men were gravely tortured by police. They were mercilessly beaten and manhandled. Some of the apprehended works even suffered bone fractures.” “Our men have been booked in false cases,” stated infuriated minister.
  
  When questioned about centre government action plan after the Sukma Maoist attack which killed 25 jawan, the minister said, “Bullets will be answered with bombs.”
