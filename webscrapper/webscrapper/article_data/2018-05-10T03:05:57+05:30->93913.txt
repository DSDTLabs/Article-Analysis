NEW DELHI: Deputy CM   on Wednesday labelled as   the decision of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to set up a high-level committee to prepare a common framework for installing, operating and monitoring  . The minister-in-charge,  , will be writing to the   soon.

 “We learnt through the media that the LG has set up a committee on CCTVs. From what we have learnt, we can say it is wrong and unconstitutional to set up such a committee. We are examining the matter and minister Satyendar Jain will write to the LG on this,” Sisodia said.
 
 Baijal had on Tuesday set-up the committee to put in place standing operating procedures (SOP) for CCTVs and also address privacy concerns. Manoj Parida, principal secretary (home), has been appointed the chairman of the committee and asked to submit a report within 30 days. 
 
 The SOP will also develop a mechanism for informing the general public and affected parties that they are under surveillance.
 
 Meanwhile, Congress stepped up its attack on the AAP-led Delhi government over the CCTV project. Former ministers Arvinder Singh, A K Walia and Haroon Yusuf met the press and demanded that the AAP government within 24 hours disclose the name of the private company with which the public sector company has a tie-up for installation of the CCTV cameras.
 
 They said if Delhi government failed to do so, then Congress will “expose” the private company. The party alleged that the AAP government was trying to extend benefits to the private firm through the public sector company. Alleging irregularities in the approval process of the project, Arvinder Singh challenged Delhi government to initiate a   inquiry.
 
 In retaliation, Sisodia said, “Congress led Delhi government for 15 years but failed to install CCTVs. It would have been better if they had actually thought of the people then and installed the cameras.”
