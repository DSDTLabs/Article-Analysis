CHENNAI: Banwarilal   has been appointed governor of  . A BJP leader from the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, he was until now the governor of Assam, a post he was appointed to in 2016. Purohit had been elected to Parliament from Nagpur three times, twice on a   ticket and once as a BJP member.

 As governor of Assam, Purohit held additional charge of Meghalaya after governor V Shanmuganathan was forced to resign following charges of misuse of the powers of Raj Bhavan.
 
 It is after a gap of one year that Tamil Nadu is getting a full-time governor. After K Rosaiah demitted office in 2016, Maharashtra governor Ch   Rao was given additional charge of Tamil Nadu and since then was shuttling between Mumbai and Chennai, capital of a state in political turmoil. The government in power has virtually lost majority following a revolt by sidelined AIADMK leader T T V Dhinakaran and is surviving only because of the disqualification of 18 rebel MLAs. The issue is pending before the Madras HC. Purohit will have his hands full soon after he assumes office as the Madras high court is expected to decide on the disqualification of 18 MLAs on October 4.
 
 Meanwhile, there has been heavy pressure on the governor from the opposition parties to convene the assembly to ascertain whether   enjoys majority support or not.The assembly was prorogued in July. Rao refused to yield to pressure and maintained that the crisis was an internal affair of the AIADMK. Moreover, he wanted a full-time governor to take charge and decide things. DMK working president M K Stalin as well as other opposition leaders have been highly critical of Rao for not convening the assembly session.
