NEW DELHI:  ,   and   on Tuesday launched   campaign to   the   being proposed in   of Delhi 2021 to provide relief to traders from the ongoing sealing drive. The RWAs have also created a “Save the city” Facebook page to mobilise residents.

 The participants in the gathering at Safdarjung Enclave said that if the proposed amendments are allowed, the quality of life in residential areas would get degraded. Rajiv Kakria from GK-I RWA said this issue affects the lives of so many people in the capital that it should get priority over the Ram Janmabhumi case and day-to-day hearing should take place in the Supreme Court.
 
 Demanded a “misuser pays policy”, the group said that “there should be a scientific basis for fixing conversion charge. Things like higher circle rates, higher mutation fee and registration charges should be introduced to discourage violations. 
 
  
 Other demands included cordoning off residential areas from commercial stretches so that safety is not compromised and a fresh survey through geo-spatial technology of stretches where land use is being converted. The resolution added that public land meant for parks, schools, etc should not be used for developing parking lots.
 
 Pankaj Agarwal from Delhi RWA Joint Front said, “Hundreds of amendments have been made to the master plan since 2006 and its sanctity has been violated. What is so masterful about the plan if it can be so easily amended?”
 
 Chetan Sharma from Confederation of NCR RWAs said that steps should be taken only after corresponding infrastructure is augmented and environment impact is assessed. “The officials responsible for the violations should be punished,” he added.
 
 “We are not against the traders, but some of the modifications being introduced by DDA will be fatal for the city and its residents as we don’t have compatible infrastructure even today,” said B S Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA Joint Front Federation.
