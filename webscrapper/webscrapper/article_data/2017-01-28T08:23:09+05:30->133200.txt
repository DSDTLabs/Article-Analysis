NOIDA: To ensure fast and easy evacuations in high-rises in case of a fire, authorities in   district will soon propose changes for the building bylaws.

 A committee of experts and civic officials has been formed for suggesting the new   measures within a month. The move follows a meeting between Rama Raman, Uttar Pradesh principal secretary, Industries and  , chief executive officers of the three authorities (Noida,   and YEIDA) and chief fire officer of the district in Lucknow on Friday.
 
 “Presently we follow the National Building Code for implementation of fire safety measures in buildings. The plan is to strengthen the fire safety norms. Besides proposing stricter norms, we want to ensure safety of occupants in high-rises and protect property from fire,” Deepak Agarwal, CEO, Noida and Greater Noida Authority told TOI from Lucknow
 
 Agarwal further informed that a committee comprising of fire experts from UP and Delhi, besides senior officials from the three authorities will study the proposal and submit a report. “A list of changes to our existing building bylaws for fire safety will be drawn up and a report will be submitted by the committee within a month. After that, the proposal will be examined in detail and it will be forwarded to the boards of the three authorities. Once approved by the boards, the proposal will be forwarded to the state government for final approval before implementation,” he explained.
 
 The amendments would primarily aim to prevent fires, ensuring that necessary training and equipment is on hand, and that the original design basis of the building, including the basic plan set out by the architect, is not compromised. “Sanctioned layout building plans will have to adhere to the norms in respect to escape routes, setbacks, elevator standards. These norms will be implemented and enforced in public buildings including schools, colleges, hospitals, institutional buildings and residential buildings,” he added.
