CHENNAI: Suspended deputy superintendent of police (DSP)  , who was in the custody of idol wing   police for five days, proved a tough nut to crack for the investigating officers.The inspector-general of police of the idol wing CID A G Pon Manickavel told reporters in   that his team of investigation officers grilled   with 62 questions vital to the investigation. Two additional superintendents of police   and Kumar have been assigned to probe Batcha.

 The officer said, “We didn't get any valid information from Batcha. If needed , we will seek the court to question Batcha in our custody again.“ He added that three additional superintendents of police, eight DSPs, apart from 100 inspectors and sub-inspectors were appointed to the idol wing CID by the state government. This new enrollment of officers has given a ray of hope in finally cracking many pending cases across the state.
 
 As Batcha's custody ended on Friday , the idol wing CID officials produced him before the special court where the judge ordered the police to detain Batcha in judicial custody till October 6.He was remanded at Trichy central prison.
 
 Police arrested Batcha from a hideout in Kumbakonam and he was later remanded in judicial custody after being produced before the court on September 13.
 
 The idol theft case gained momentum on June 27 after Madras high court judge Justice Mahadevan came down hard on the idol wing CID officials for not initiating any action against officials involved in the case.
 
 Subsequently, a police team arrested sub inspector Subburaj, 54, who was serving as police head constable in 2008 when he and Batcha are believed to have obtained antique idols from a farmer and later sold them to the idol smuggler G Deenadayalan, who is currently facing many cases, for Rs 2 crore.
