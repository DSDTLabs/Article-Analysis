SHIMLA: After the state government passed a bill to regularize around 30,000   across Himachal Pradesh, it is now gearing up to regularize illegal encroachment on government land for which it has decided to submit an   to the  .

 Revenue minister Kaul Singh Thakur said that the state government was not in favour of encroachments, however, it intends to give relief to those small and marginal farmers and poor people who had constructed their houses on government land or occupied it due to some compulsion.
 
 The issue of regualrizing the encroachment on government land would also be examined against the provisions of the Forest Rights Act so that bonafide forest dwellers could be identified and their rights determined, minister said. To discuss the issue third meeting of the high powered committee on encroachments on government land constituted by the state government was held in Shimla on Saturday .
 
 Officials said that Himachal Pradesh assembly had passed a resolution to consider regularization of encroachments of poor and needy people on humanitarian grounds, but as the high court had passed various orders to evacuate the illegal possessions on government land, the state government would soon submit a policy before the court within the parameters of the law in order to provide and relief to the small and marginal far mers.
 
 Thakur, has also directed the officials that draft policy and appropriate scheme should be submitted for the consideration of the committee members in the next meeting scheduled for February 7. He, however, reiterated the government's commitment to uphold the law and deal with big and influential encroachers strictly.
 
 In a judgement delivered by the division bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Sureshwar Thakur of Himachal Pradesh high court on August 29 last year, it observed that permitting unauthorized construction under the nose of the authorities and later on regularizing them amounts to failure of constitutional mechanism and the machinery.
