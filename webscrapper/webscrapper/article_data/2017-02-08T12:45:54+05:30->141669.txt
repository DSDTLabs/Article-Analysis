Bosses at   have filed a lawsuit against the late singer's former manager over a TV show based on her life.
 
  The star's business manager   teamed up with Spanish-language network bosses at Univision to shoot the series "Su verdadero nombre era Dolores" ( ), based on his experiences working with Jenni.
  
  Her relatives, who are working on their own biographical show, sued Salgado over the project in September and tried to put a stop to the series, claiming only estate executors and Jenni's kids have "the sole right whether and/or how such information about their mother may be revealed".
  
  They also alleged Salgado signed a 2013 non-disclosure agreement, in which he pledged not to reveal "any information to anyone about Ms. Rivera, her family or the company managing her assets".
  
  Their efforts suffered a setback in December (16) when a judge denied their request to move forward with the suit against Salgado, and they were dealt a further blow when the judge refused to grant an injunction seeking to prevent the show from broadcast.
  
  According to TMZ, executives at the company have launched a lawsuit claiming the show is defamatory. They are seeking at least USD 10 million in damages.
  
  "Her Real Name Was Dolores" debuted last month.
  
  The Mexican-American star, born Dolores Janney Rivera, was killed in a plane crash in 2012.
