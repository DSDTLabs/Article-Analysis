NEW DELHI:   Chief Minister   on Saturday said that she "will ask for judicial inquiry into incidents at   and   area."

 "For over a month there has been unrest in the hills. Centre is not cooperating to maintain law and order in Darjeeling," she said adding, "two TV channels will have to face the music."
 
  
  
 She also appealed to people of Darjeeling "to not resort to violence and maintain peace."
 
 Earlier, the central delegation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was detained by the Kolkata Police near   area, when they were on their way to riot-hit Basirhat area.
 
 The delegation comprised of Parliament members Om Mathur,   and Satyapal Singh who later had an argument with the police when they were stopped from entering Basirhat. 
 
 The leaders were then carted away to the airport in a police van, flanked by cops and their supporters alike.
 
 "Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) is not applicable here and they cannot arrest us. They should have taken us to other jurisdiction and let them decide. The contradiction is that on one side they are not letting three members of the Parliament to travel and on the other hand they are saying everything is under control. On what basis are they arresting I don't know," BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi told media.
 
 She added that the Mamata Banerjee Government will get to know what the reality is and that the State Government is hiding more than what seems on the ground.
 
 Lekhi was also stopped at the Kolkata Airport earlier in the day.
 
 Yesterday, the BJP, Left and the Congress delegations 
  in Basirhat by the police.
 
 BJP's state-level delegation led by veteran actor and BJP leader Roopa Ganguly along with 19 party leaders, which was heading towards Baduria, was detained by the police at Michael Nagar near Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata yesterday.
