BENGALURU: The Karnataka government's canopy walk project to enable tourists to walk amid woods between Castle Rock in Uttara Kannada district and Dudhsagar Falls on the   border, has hit a roadblock.

 Though work had started on building infrastructure passing through eight huge trees on the stretch from Kuveshi to Dudhsagar Falls as part of the first leg of the project, the forest department has now taken exception to it.
 
 The Canopy Walk is part of the 270km Great   project from Jog Falls to Castle Rock, where trekkers will be allowed to en joy the beauty of t h e Ghats.
 
 K S Sugara, princi p a l chief conservator of forests, in a recent directive to  , additional principal chief conservator of forests (vigilance), asked for a detailed report on work started on the Great Canara Trail, claiming that his information is that work had been taken up illegally. “It has come to my notice that work on the Great Canara Trail, worth Rs 1cr, has been implemented in some parts of   without necessary approvals from the National Wildlife Board and the National Tiger Conservation Authority. This needs to be investigated,“ says the directive.
 
 Malkedde said he has started gathering evidence and documents on the project. “I will be in a position to give an update after 10 days,“ he added.
