KAIRANA, SHAMLI
  While BJP’s   candidate   has been visiting villages in her constituency in this scorching heat, the grand alliance’s conspicuous absence on the ground is attributed to fasting during  , which has forced both leaders and sympathisers to stay indoors, especially during the day.
 
  “We have been campaigning mostly during the night and in the early morning hours. The long fasting hours coupled with the scorching heat has made canvassing difficult during the day. We are now focusing on holding public meetings after locals break their fast around 7 in the evening,”  , a campaign aide of SP-RLD candidate  , said.
  
  Another concern for the grand alliance is the voter turnout on the polling day (May 28) which may dip owing to Ramzan fasting. There are more than 5 lakh Muslim voters in Kairana Lok Sabha constituency who can play a crucial role in deciding the winning candidate.
  
  While BJP has been holding rallies addressed by some of its top leaders, the grand alliance has been focused on door-to-door campaigning through jalsas, padyatras and block and panchayat-level public meetings.
  
  Surprisingly, none of the top SP leaders have visited the constituency so far and RLD president Ajeet Singh and vice-president Jayant Chaudhary have been holding the fort for the alliance. “Our cadre from across the state has been pressed into action and has been assigned clear responsibilities. We have been closely working with RLD for days now,” Sanjay Lathar, SP MLC and the party’s Kairana bypoll in-charge, said.
