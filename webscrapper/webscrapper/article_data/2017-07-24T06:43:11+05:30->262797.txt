AHMEDABAD: Once   was himself social media manager of Sardar Patel Group (SPG), led by Patidar leader Lalji Patel. Hardik is now the spearhead of the Patidar’s OBC quota stir. He has himself started a team of 712 social media warriors to exposed the fake claims of the government and tackle trolls. Hardik, convener of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), said he has started with a team of 712 social media campaigners to ensure truth about development claims can be known and the government’s fake claims exposed.

  “We will create 25,000 WhatsApp groups; 5,000 Facebook accounts, 2,000 Facebook pages and 1,000 Twitter accounts to give true information to people of Gujarat,” Hardik told TOI. “Today there is a trend of floating fake news, propaganda and even misleading issues. Our social media warriors will dig out the truth from all the fake stuff,” he said. 
 
 Patel said they will not only talk about reservation and the   it, but they will also find out the truth behind propaganda such as “benefits of Goods and   (GST), claims of corruption-free society through demonetization; progress of farmers through schemes like   and SAUNI (Saurashtra-Narmada Avataran Irrigation Yojana).”
 
 “Our volunteers will find the truth and present it in as creative posts on the social media. This way, we can bust the fake claims of the government,” Hardik said. He claimed he had made a road-map of 150 days till the election in Gujarat to expose the fake claims of the ruling party. 
 
 Hardik said that he will again conduct a review meeting with his volunteers after a fortnight in which those 712 social media warriors will take along one other person with them to strengthen their team.
