The royal   which took place on May 19th between   and Duchess of Sussex   was one of the biggest events around the world. Thanks to their modern approach, the entire world got to witness the beautiful ceremony. While it was one of the most exclusive weddings with invites only to a selected few, Prince Harry raised a lot of eyebrows when he invited his exes Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas.

 
 Apparently, it is some sort of a royal tradition and even Prince William had followed the same. While Cressida seemed quite fine while attending the ceremony, Chelsy, on the other hand, almost did not turn up to the wedding of her ex. Prince Harry had called Chelsy, whom he dated for close to 7 years to welcome her at the ceremony and afternoon reception, but her invite did not extend to the party in the evening.
 
 
 Chelsyâ€™s friend revealed to a media portal that it was a parting call in which they both acknowledged Harry was moving on. The source added that Chelsy was quite emotional about it all, she was in tears and almost didn't go to the wedding. In the end, she went and promised Harry she wouldn't try and gatecrash the party.
 
 
 It is also believed that Harry's other ex, Cressida Bonas, was also left off the guest-list for the bash at Frogmore House.
