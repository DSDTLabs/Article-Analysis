GURDASPUR: Amid heightened tension on the  ,   militant outfits made a futile intrusion bid from Gurdaspur sector in Punjab on early Tuesday morning.

 Border Security Force (BSF) deputy inspector general (DIG), Gurdaspur sector,   told TOI that they had recovered three AK-47 rifles, six magazines and 150 rounds, two pistols, two pistol magazines and 100 rounds and six hand grenades from near Kassowal border outpost (BOP).
 
 The seizure holds significance since the BSF’s Kassowal BOP is close to   town near Batala police district. Earlier, the Pakistani terrorists, who had struck at the Pathankot Air Force base and Dinanagar police station, had also entered through the riverine gaps on the border in the Gurdaspur district.
 
 Sharma said, “If they tried to intrude, they would have definitely been killed. They had entered just two steps into Indian territory when our jawans spotted their movement and challenged them.”
 
 He said as soon as the suspicious movement was observed, BSF troops challenged the intruders who fled back to Pakistan leaving behind the consignment of arms and ammunition. Due to thick fog, the search operation was carried out early morning with the help of sniffer dogs he said, adding that by 2 pm, BSF was able to seize arms and ammunition. He said BSF had informed the police for further investigations.
 
 Intelligence sources informed TOI that terrorists, who enjoy backing of Pakistani army and Pakistan Rangers, wanted to engage Indian troops not just in Jammu and Kashmir but also in Punjab border and were helped by Sikh militants whom they had given shelter in their country.
 
 Sources expressed concern over lack of sharing of intelligence input between the security agencies which led to ‘safe’ exit of two Pakistani-trained terrorists from the Attari border. However, they were later arrested in a joint operation by the Army, police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Baramulla district of J&K on February 3.
