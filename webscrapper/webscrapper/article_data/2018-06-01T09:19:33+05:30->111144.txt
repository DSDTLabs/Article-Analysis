KONNAGAR/DURGAPUR: Tourists from Bengal who have been stuck at Drass in Jammu & Kashmir after a landslide on Tuesday complained that their condition has worsened in the past 24 hours. Around 5,000 tourists, half of them from Bengal, remained stuck on the   even on Thursday.

 
 While hotels exponentially hiked room charges, many tourists found it impossible to get hold of cash since the ATMs were shut because of the bank strike. Even when some of them managed to get hold of the money, they didn’t find rooms and had to sleep in their cars. The price of food, too, had doubled.
 
 A 26-member group from Bengal — 23 from   and the rest from Belgharia — were among those who have been stranded on the Kargil-Srinagar Road since Wednesday night.
 
 Police in Drass, however, have informed tourists that the Army’s operations to clear boulders and other debris from the landslide spot will be through by Thursday night and traffic will be able to move from Friday.
