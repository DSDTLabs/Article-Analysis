KOLKATA: A Class-X student of Nava Nalanda School went missing under mysterious circumstances on Wednesday. After writing an exam in the morning, school topper Sayandeep Sinha (14) attended his physical training class. He was last seen outside his school, walking towards the Mudiali bus stop near  , by one of his classmates.

 Tollygunge police has registered a missing complaint in this regard and is trying to trace Sinha. His family said they haven’t received any ransom call so far. According to his cousin Anirban Mishra, the teen had left school around 11.40am.
 
 “His school friend, like on most days, volunteered to drop him near the bus stop but he refused saying his mother would pick him up. He would usually return by 12.30pm. We started looking for him at 2pm. All our relatives across the country have been informed but we haven’t received any updates or leads so far,” said Mishra.
 
 Sinha, a Haridevpur resident, is a single child. His father,  , is a senior officer at the state Land and Land Revenue department.
 
 Police said the teen seems to have ‘left’ with Rs 4,200, which was awarded to him for being the school topper in Class-IX. One of his favourite T-shirts is missing as well. When he went missing, he was wearing his school uniform — white shirt and pant.
 
 “I’m very worried as this seems pre-planned. He loved his books and rarely interacted with anyone outside home, besides his teachers. Thus, it seems odd that he would decide to leave at a time he was performing well. He was quite cheerful while celebrating Holi recently,” said Mishra.
 
 Police said they have shared Sinha’s photographs across all police stations, hospitals and railway stations. “We’re speaking to teachers and trying to locate him. The fact that he was not carrying any mobile phone makes our job all the more difficult,” said an investigating officer, adding, the detective department will assist them in the probe.
