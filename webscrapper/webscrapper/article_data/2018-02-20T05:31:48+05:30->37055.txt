MUMBAI: A Bangalore doctor was in for a shock recently when she pulled the chain of a CSMT-bound train on seeing a woman commuter fall off the ladies compartment. The doctor,  , who had boarded the train in  , has claimed that the chain was not functioning as the train did not stop and it was sheer luck that the woman who had fallen survived.

  officials have, however, claimed there was nothing wrong with the chain as a signal was received by the motorman. “A train guard looked back and saw the woman who had fallen off get up and walk away. So, instead of disrupting the train schedule, the motorman decided to stop at the next station,  ,” said chief public relations officer (CR) Sunil  .
 
  
  
 But refuting CR’s claim, Hussain said two people who were near the tracks rescued the woman a nd she did not walk away on her own. Hussain is in Mumbai to meet a relative and on Friday, she was on her way to meet some friends in south Mumbai. The incident took place around 10.30am on Friday.
 
 A CR official said that the the motorman and the guard of the train informed the station master at Thakurli about the incident.
 
 Talking to TOI, Hussain said, “Another commuter who was travelling on the footboard informed us that the woman who had fallen off was safe and that two passersby helped her.”
 
 Hussain added that the train was slow and hence, the woman was not injured. “We were surprised that the motorman did not stop,” said the doctor, who has made a video of the incident and put it on social media.
 
 Udasi said, “The allegations are wrong as after the chain was pulled, the motorman and the guard noticed it. As the train was slow and the woman was safe, they decided not to stop the train.”
