New Delhi:   is likely to   the   for 2018-19 admissions between   — a   than  .

 Along with the early announcement of the cut-off list, DU is also planning to reduce the number of lists this year.
 
 Announcing the admission procedure for this year, members of the admission committee had on January 15 informed that they had received several complaints about “prolonged admission procedure” and “unrealistically” high cut-offs. To streamline the process and cut the duration, the committee decided to approach colleges.
 
 The committee had claimed that they would send admission data of previous years to colleges and show them how more realistic cut-offs could have ensured a faster admission process, Maharaja K Pandit, head of the admission committee had informed.
 
 “Unrealistic” cut-offs by some colleges, he added, often result in a large number of vacant seats in some subjects even after the 10th cut-off list and DU has to conduct special drives to fill them up.
 
 This year too, DU will hold a special drive for the Scheduled Caste, Tribes and the OBC students, whose seats are often left vacant even after several cut-off lists. This special drive will be conducted after the fifth list on the university campus in a centralised manner.
 
 According to experts, high cut-off marks are because of the high marks students get in the board exams. It is for this that DU had claimed that they will, for the first time, write to different boards to get information about any moderation or “spiking” of marks to “formulate admission guidelines accordingly”.
