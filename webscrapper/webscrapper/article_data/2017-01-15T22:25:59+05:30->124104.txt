NEW DELHI: Untitled   made his maiden Grandmaster norm despite losing to Grandmaster   of Uzbekistan in the ninth and penultimate round of 15th   chess tournament here today.

 Having secured 6.5 points against high-ranked opponents in the first eight rounds, Navalgund only had to turn up to play his game in the ninth round and despite the loss his performance thus far was good enough for a grandmaster norm.
 
 Being untitled, Navalgund has set a new benchmark for youngsters and the Chennai-based author looks good to be a Grandmaster in quick time.
 
 Meanwhile Grandmaster Farrukh   of Tajikistan stayed ahead of the field with a quick draw against Swayams Mishra. With 8 points in his kitty, Amanotov remains the sole leader and is now trailed by   and   who both are a half point behind.
 
 The Rs. 18 Lakh tournament will come to an end tomorrow and it seems Amanotov is the hot favourite at this point. However as the last round pairings suggest Diptayan Ghosh has a task on hand if he can win against the top ranked player here.
 
 Local hopeful Sahaj Grover has a chance to finish in top ten if he can win his last round game against Saptarshi Roy. However the Bengal International Master is in top form here.
 
  has been in best form in the last few games and all eyes will be on him in the last round too. His uncompromising style calls for a scintillating finish to this year's event.
 
 For the next year, the prize money bar has been raised to over Rs. 77 lakhs. The Delhi International is the highest attended event in the country with participation of over 2000 players.
