MARGAO: Congress Curtorim MLA Alexio   has said that Prime Minister   and Union minister of environment, forest and climate change Dr Harsh Vardhan ‘should respect the public opinion of Goans’ and the opposition to proposals to turn the state into a coal hub and coal corridor as well as against the nationalisation of six rivers. He said that   and Vardhan should intervene in the matter as both these proposals are bound to ruin Goa’s pristine beauty and reputation as a preferred tourist destination. 

 In a recent letter to Modi and Vardhan,   brought to their notice that the gram sabhas of over 100 (out of 189) villages in Goa have passes resolutions to oppose both the proposals. 
 
 “Goa witnessed unprecedented environmental public hearings on coal handling expansion projects in April/May 2017. Not a single participant supported the proposals. This would indicate to you the groundswell opposition to the project. From time immemorial, the rivers of Goa have been connected with the existence of its indigenous population. Nationalisation of these rivers would forever jeopardise their livelihood. Moreover, consent to designate the six rivers as national waterways and thereby, concede their control to the central government was given by then state government in July 2015 without any feasibility study or consultation with stakeholders whatsoever,” the letter read.
