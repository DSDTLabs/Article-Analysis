Panaji: Goa will continue to experience light to moderate rainfall during the next two days, even as the withdrawal of southwest monsoon from the state may take more than a week. After the monsoon ended on September 30 with a 14% deficit in normal range, the rainfall has been fairly widespread. During the last 24 hours most centres experienced moderate rainfall. “This is due to the cyclonic circulation over interior Odisha and its neighbourhood,” M L Sahu, director, India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, said. A trough from the above circulation extending to north Kerala is also likely to increase the wind speed and bring in moisture for more rain. “But the rain activity will decrease after two days,” Sahu said. The southwest monsoon had started withdrawing from the north and the withdrawal line extends across north Madhya Pradesh. “It may withdraw from Goa between October 7 and 10,” Sahu said.
