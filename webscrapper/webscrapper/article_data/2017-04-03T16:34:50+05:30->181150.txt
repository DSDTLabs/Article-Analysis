MUMBAI:   passengers can now buy tickets online on its website, mobile site and mobile app by using the industry’s latest payment mechanism - Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

 "With the introduction of this option, Jet Airways becomes the only Indian airline to provide guests with this convenient payment solution," said a statement issued by Jet. "As a revolutionary payment system, UPI allows money to be transferred instantaneously between any two bank accounts instantly, using a smartphone," it added.
 
  Launched by   (NPCI) to further RBI’s vision of migrating towards a less-cash and a more digital society, UPI employs standard application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide an interoperable system for seamless transfers on top of the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) platform.
 
 UPI becomes Jet Airways’ 21st digital payment option to be offered to guests and represents the airline’s extensive and relentless emphasis towards embracing technology and deploying it first in the form of innovative solutions that provide its guests with superior value and choice.
 
 "Transacting via UPI is extremely easy for guests who must opt for the ‘UPI payment option’ during the booking process in order to transact via a Virtual Payment Address - which acts as their financial address and is linked to their bank accounts. UPI does away with guests having to remember and enter their bank details online to enable transactions and guests only have to remember their M-Pin for facilitating any payment," said the release.
 
 In the recent past, Jet Airways has introduced multiple customer-centric solutions such as ‘Seat Select’, ‘Fare Lock’, ‘JetAdvance’ and ‘Fare Choices’ and `JetScreen’ – its WiFi-enabled streaming solution which lets passengers enjoy in-flight entertainment on their personal devices. In another first, the airline recently partnered with Uber to offer seamless travel solutions from doorstep to doorstep.
