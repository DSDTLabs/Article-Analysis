Amritsar: The producer of the movie  , which has come under strong criticism from sections of the Sikh community for allegedly showing Sikh master Guru Nanak Dev and his family in life form, has said the Punjabi flick is not a religious one.

 Harinder Singh Sikka told TOI this past week that the first Sikh guru never created a religion. “Nanak was born to a Hindu family 550 years ago. He spread an essence of humanity in his whole life and he didn’t punish anybody,” said Sikka.
 
 He said he sought the Akal Takht and SGPC’s permission at every step, so he did not understand why they were blaming and excommunicating him. “The movie won three national awards last year — Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, Best Film for Make-up, and Best Film for Costumes,” he said.
 
 Asked if he was scared of the anger of Sikhs against him, Sikka said he served the Indian Navy from 1979 to 1993, when he took premature retirement as lieutenant commander. “I was an embedded journalist in Kargil. In a lakh people, how many will do that? It is not that I am not scared, but one has to fight their fears; now, if somebody has to target me, he will do his job,” he said.
 
 He said he did not what had been the response to the movie on the first day of its release. “This is not for profit; studios are keeping me away intentionally,” he said, adding that the film’s rights were sold in 2017 and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee had been praising it till March 28. “They took a U-turn on the 29th, and I have no idea why.”
