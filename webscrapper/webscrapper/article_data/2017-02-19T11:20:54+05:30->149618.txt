MUMBAI: When the   T20 Inter-Zonal tournament began in Mumbai on Sunday, no one would have given East Zone a chance of winning the title. Hosts   and North Zone were firm favourites considering the balance of their teams. But East, led by the inspirational  , proved everyone wrong.

 On Saturday, East Zone defeated West Zone by eight wickets to seal the title and became the only team to have won all their league games in the tournament. West Zone, who trudged to 149-5 in their 20 overs, started proceedings intently. Openers   (52) and skipper   (17) gave them a decent start and had reached 35 in 4.3 overs. Jackson laboured to a 44-ball 52 and had it not been for Rujul Bhatt's 20-ball 36 in the final overs of West Zone's innings, they would have struggled to even reach 149-5.
 
 East Zone, who were virtually assured of the title even before they could take the field against West Zone, were determined to leave nothing to chance. Their openers Karthick and last match hero Virat Singh came out all guns blazing. The other standout performer for East Zone in this tournament,  , was in a destructive mood.
