AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Thursday denied bail to three persons who are accused of theft in long distance trains. Sunil Sinh, Shashikant Mishra and Sanjit Kahar were caught on charges of theft from trains. Investigation revealed that they used to book tickets in the trains, and when co-passengers were asleep during the night, they used to rob them off their belongings. 

 They allegedly used to throw bags out of the bogie they travelled in and later collect them. Public prosecutor   argued before the court that all three accused are from different states and they ganged up to commit the crime. He further argued that if granted bail, they may not be available for the trial.
