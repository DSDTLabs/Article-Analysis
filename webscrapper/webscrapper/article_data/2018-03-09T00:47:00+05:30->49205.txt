Tuticorin: Human rights activist Irom Sharmila has expressed concern over her inability to speak for Sri Lankan Tamils at Geneva on March 23 as her passport has not been cleared. Talking to reporters after taking part in the International Women’s Day celebrations in a few colleges here on Thursday, she said that there was a delay in getting clearance for the passport despite applying for it six months ago.

 “After ending my protests I settled down in Kodaikanal. I have become close to issues of Tamil people,” she said and added that she decided to attend a meeting at Geneva to speak for the Tamil minorities in Northern Sri Lanka. But, she said she has not been issued the passport.
 
 “I am a citizen of India. Freedom of movement is guaranteed in the country and if it is true why are the officials hesitating to issue my passport?” she asked.
 
 Earlier, while addressing students she spoke on the struggles she faced while fighting for the people and encouraged students to voice against human rights violation.
 
 She called Tuticorin one of the worst-polluted towns in Tamil Nadu. Sharmila said that a few industries have polluted water in the town.
