CHENNAI: At a time when bus frequency is hit by shortage of workforce, government records accessed by TOI reveal that drivers and conductors from unions affiliated to the ruling party have been given desk jobs in  .

 Nearly 180 men who were hired to work as conductors and drivers now work as medical caretakers, security guards,   and traffic regulators at various government bus depots in and around Madurai.
 
 This has, in turn, reduced the overall operation of government buses up to 10,000 km a day, resulting in a loss of Rs 9 crore a year, says V Pitchai, from Madurai government transport workersâ€™ union, who sourced this information through  . Besides the loss, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Madurai, spends nearly Rs 7.2 crore every month for paying salary to them. This includes Rs 2 lakh for laundering their uniforms every year.
 
 
  
  
 
 It is to be noted that the corporation is incurring a loss of Rs 340 crore every year and that was cited, by the government, as the reason for increasing the bus fares recently.
 
 Despite bringing this issue to the notice of the authorities concerned multiple times, no action has been taken so far, says Pitchai. Even though there was no vacancy for desk jobs in the transport corporation, these members were added to the service. As a result, the burden on other drivers and conductors has increased for the past three years. Every driver of the transport corporation has to drive 4km extra, in addition to their regular workload, to make up for this anomaly, reveals government data.
