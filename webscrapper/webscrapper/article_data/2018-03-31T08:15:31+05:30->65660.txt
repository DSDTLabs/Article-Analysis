MADIKERI: A 32-year-old   who pretended to be a   from Mumbai was arrested within 48 hours of arriving in Virajpet in Kodagu district.

 Soumya Ranjan Mishra gave himself away as he made calls from his mobile to at least seven officers in various levels of the government and demanded privileges accorded to an IAS officer — a dedicated vehicle and accommodation. The calls were made within hours of reaching the town.
 
 According to Virajpet Rural police, officers grew suspicious at the number of demands made by “the visiting officer”. On Kodagu deputy commissioner Shri Vidya’s instructions, police took Mishra into custody on Friday.
 
 Mishra pulled off his first con job with finesse when he telephoned the Mysuru City Corporation commissioner for an official vehicle to go to Virajpet. On the phone, he introduced himself as a revenue department commissioner from Mumbai. The Mysuru commissioner arranged a vehicle in which Mishra motored down to Virajpet on Wednesday and stayed at a resort.
 
 Looking up government websites for contact numbers of district officers, Mishra made calls to Virajpet deputy superintendent of police Nagappa, circle inspector of police Kumar Aradhya and sub-inspector of police Basavaraju, and asked them to provide him a gunman. He didn’t stop there. He contacted DC Shri Vidya and district superintendent of police Rajendra Prasad to provide him the protocol extended to a visiting officer.
 
 Hailing from Beeraram Chandrapur village in Puri district, Mishra worked as a software developer for a while. He reportedly told police he tried to pose himself as an IAS officer for “the benefits it brings”.
 
 A woman, who stayed with Mishra as his wife, told police later she was clueless about his fraudulent activities.
