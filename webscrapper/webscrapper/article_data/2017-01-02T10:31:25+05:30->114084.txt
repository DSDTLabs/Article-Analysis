NEW DELHI: It was almost like the entire city had descended on  . While it was a carnival of sorts for those celebrating the New Year, it was a traffic nightmare for others.

 Police were out in full force to ensure that the situation didn't spiral out of control. In the melee, people had to wait for hours in their vehicles to find a way through.
 
 “It's like a bubble has burst and people have come out of that bubble. I have never seen this kind of crowd near India Gate,“ joked, Atul, a commuter.
 
 Street-food vendors were delighted with the sudden, if only short-lived, spurt in business. For the first time since demonetisation virtually broke their back, they had people queuing up at their stalls. “The note ban had killed our business, but today was very satisfying.The first day of the new year has brought us a lot of cheer and hope,“ said  , who sells bhel puri at India Gate.
 
 The stretch from   station to Supreme Court was packed with people.  , a Najafgarh resident, walked to the Metro station from India Gate with her husband and three children as she couldn't find a bus or an auto.
 
 “There are so many people and vehicles are reduced to a crawl. Many people like us preferred to walk to our destination,“ she said. Many who had come to India Gate to soak in the fun said they were leaving early as the numbers kept increasing.Those who had come from far-off areas were worried about not reaching home on time. The rush notwithstanding, the mood was largely light. There were hardly any complaints of misbehaviour. “We have come from Jafrabad. It's a new year, so my children insisted that we visit India Gate. Most people here are for the same reason as we don't mind the chaos,“ said Naushad Ahmed.
