Ludhiana: An unidentified miscreant hacked the netbanking account of a city-based hosiery unit owner and transferred Rs70 lakh from his account to five different accounts on Tuesday. The miscreant initially blocked the mobile number of the businessman to ensure he did not get any security message, and then made the transactions. 

 In his complaint to the police, 63-year-old Arun Beri of Civil Lines stated that the entire incident happened in the wee hours of Tuesday morning when he was sleeping. On Tuesday morning, when he woke up, he noticed a ‘no service’ message on his mobile. However, he ignored it. Later, when he checked his e-mails, he saw that he had received a mail from the bank that his netbanking password was changed. “I immediately called up the bank, and said I had not changed my netbanking password. However, I had received a mail regarding that. Further, when I asked about the amount in the bank account, I was told I had only Rs10 lakh in my account. However, my account had a total of Rs80 lakh,” said Beri.
