VIJAYAWADA: Vijayawada Municipal Corporation   on Thursday approved 97 key resolutions, including a controversial plan permitting law and sports development minister   Ravindra to construct his residence on a land parcel previously allotted for the staff quarters of the engineering wing.

 The said land parcel is currently Ravindra’s camp office at Brindavan Colony in Labbipet. As the minister’s proposal, the residence will come up on a three-year lease basis on the first floor of the building and the cost will be borne Ravindra. VMC’s engineering wing on the advice of civil department of VR Siddhartha Engineering College certified that the building is fit an additional floor construction. Standing committee chaired by deputy mayor   on Thursday gave in-principle approval for the application and asked the officials to prepare lease details.
 
 However, the decision created a controversy in the meeting. 
 
 “VMC which is harassing the common man in the name of taxes is allotting its valuable assets to the minister at low lease rates. TDP legislators in the city are busy grabbing lands from the poor and now ministers are trying to capture valuable lands of   in the name of leases,” said YSRC leader Malladi Vishnuvardhan.
