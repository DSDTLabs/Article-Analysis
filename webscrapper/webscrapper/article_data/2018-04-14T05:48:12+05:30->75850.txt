NEW DELHI:   Industries on Friday withdrew its appeal against an National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order in the Supreme Court after the apex court refused to allow an out-of-court settlement for the debt-ridden subsidiary Binani Cement. The case will now go back to the   (NCLT).

 
 A bench comprising justices A K Goel and R F Nariman was told by senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Binani Industries, that there was nothing in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, which prevented the company from entering a settlement and securing itself.
 
 
  
 
 The bench, however, observed,“Why should we interfere at this stage? Binani plea appears to be ‘put up’ by UltraTech, the failed bidder.”
 
 The lawyer appearing for UltraTech said there were no grounds to disqualify them from making the offer.
 
 Binani Industries had received an offer from the Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech to transfer its 98.4% stake in Binani Cement for Rs 7,266 crore. However, the deal was subject to ending the insolvency proceedings against Binani Cement — whose committee of creditors (CoC) led by Bank of Baroda — has approved a Rs 6,350-crore bid from Dalmia Bharat group’s wholly owned subsidiary, Rajputana Properties.
 
 The NCLAT had in March granted “liberty to the parties to reach settlement”.
 
 Dalmia Bharat group’s offer to pay Rs 6,350 crore for Binani Cement was selected by the CoC of the company. However, later,   entered into an agreement with   to buy 98.4% stake in BCL. It had also agreed to issue a comfort letter to provide Rs 7,266 crore to Binani Industries for ending insolvency proceedings against Binani Cement.
