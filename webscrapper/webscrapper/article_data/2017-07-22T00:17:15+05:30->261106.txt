Pune: The district administration has told every   office in Pune to house a MahaOnline   kendra on their premises. 

 With MahaOnline in possession of nearly 90 registration kits, the exercise is expected to commence soon, said deputy election officer and in charge of Aadhaar, Monica Singh Thakur
 
 This is expected to make it easier for people to enrol for Aadhaar cards. At present, Pune district as a 91% Aadhaar coverage. 
 
 Not only ward office, government schools will also have to make space, as per a recent central government directive. “We will start with ward  . As MahaOnline gets more kits, it will spread,” an official said. 
 
 The district is expected to complete the process by end of August, officials said. 
 
 MahaOnline was given responsibility for the remainder of the   process after government-appointed agencies were delisted following reports of non-functional kits. 
 
 A MahaOnline official told TOI that they aim to start the process at the earliest, after registering the machine and the official with the kit. “The district has a long way to go. Other than Mulshi and Khed, every taluka has to meet the target,” the official said. Pune city has a pendency of 15%, while Daund has 20%, officials said. 
 
 Aadhaar operators in the city said low awareness is the main reason for only 85% coverage in Pune city. “We had repeatedly requested the administration to spread word,” a private operator said. Such operators must soon shift to government premises. 
 
 There were complaints of private operators charging people for enrolment. “Centres operating from government premises will help keep a tab on such practices,” said Thakur. 
 
 Meanwhile, the postal department too started operating Aadhaar   on their premises. However in Pune, this can be found only at the General Post Office and the city post office. The department intends to up these numbers. In the state, 20 post offices have Aadhaar centres.
