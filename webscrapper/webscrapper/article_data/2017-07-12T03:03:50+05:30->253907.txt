Mumbai:   legislator   on Tuesday called on Chief Minister   to demand a judicial probe into the death of   inmate  . 

 “Since Manjula Shetye died in Byculla jail under mysterious circumstances and doubts have been expressed over fair investigation, it will be most appropriate to set up a commission under the commission of inquiry act,’’ Gorhe said. Gorhe said some of the inmates should be shifted elsewhere and statements of all the inmates recorded in-camera before independent officials. “If the statements are recorded in-camera, then only they will speak,’’ she said.
 
 Gorhe said during her meeting with the CM, she handed over a letter written by a senior woman jail official to her. In the one-page letter, it has been alleged that a section of high-ranking jail officials is exploiting the subordinates. “In view of the serious allegations in the letter, I spoke to the jail official, but she denied having written any such letter,’’ Gorhe said. Gorhe said even if the jail official has denied, Fadnavis should order a high-level probe into the contents of the letter. The jail official, against whom allegations have been made, has sought appointment with Gorhe. 
 
 A senior IPS official said the probe should be handed over to a woman officer. “Initially, a woman officer was probing the death, then it was entrusted with Inspector General Rajvardhan. We have no doubts about the integrity and honesty of Rajvardhan, but it’s felt a woman officer should be asked to probe the state of affairs in the jail,’’ he said.
