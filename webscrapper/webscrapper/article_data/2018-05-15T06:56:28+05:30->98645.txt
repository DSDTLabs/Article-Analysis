BENGALURU: US private equity major   has offloaded an 8% stake in Indian IT firm   at Rs 960 apiece to a clutch of investors, including new foreign funds T Rowe Price, Nomura and Oppenheimer.

 
 According to block-deal data on the   website, Blackstone sold 1.54 crore shares for Rs 1,484 crore. Of this, Oppenheimer bought 2.3 per cent stake for Rs 270 crore, Nomura (through its two units) 2.1 per cent stake for Rs 254 crore, and Hong Kong's FSI 2 per cent stake for Rs 234 crore.
 
 As of March 31, Blackstone, through Marble II, held 60.4 per cent stake in Mphasis. After this deal, its holding is reduced to 52.4 per cent. In Monday's flat market, Mphasis stock touched an intraday high of Rs 1,032 on the NSE, but closed 0.6% lower at Rs 982.
 
 The price at which Blackstone sold the 8 per cent stake was more than double it had paid for buying into the firm two years ago. At that time, the PE major had paid   Rs 430 a share and followed it up with an open offer at Rs 457. Two years ago, Blackstone bought Hewlett-Packard's 60.5 per cent stake for $825 million.
 
 A Blackstone spokesperson said Monday's block deal was strategically executed to create more liquidity in the stock and enable high-quality, long-term investors to participate in the Mphasis growth story. "Blackstone is committed to remaining a long-term majority shareholder of Mphasis and retaining control of the company. Blackstone does not currently intend to sell any additional stake," the spokesperson said.
 
 Analysts tracking the development said that potential buybacks and dividends based on the existing cash balance provide comfort for the stock. But a Mumbai-based analyst said future buybacks at a premium will likely be dilutive to earnings.
