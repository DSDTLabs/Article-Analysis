NEW DELHI: A 54-year-old   from Mumbai was   by three men in   on Sunday morning. The journalist, Vinay Ratan, claimed he was   by the men to   a   against certain people.

 Senior police officers said the incident happened at 8.30am when Ratan was going towards Ghaziabad after landing in Delhi. 
 
 Ratan told cops that as they were travelling in a friend’s car, three men came on a motorcycle and started to drive alongside their vehicle near Vasant Kunj. One of them asked Ratan if he was from Mumbai and told him to step out for an enquiry when he affirmed.
 
 “As soon as I stepped out, the men started to beat me up telling me to withdraw the case against their clients or they’ll kill me and my family and fled,” Ratan said.
 
 A case under sections of causing hurt, wrongful restraint and criminal intimidation has been registered.
 
 A preliminary investigation revealed that Ratan is fighting a court case against two men in Mumbai on some financial dispute. Cops suspect that the accused followed Ratan from the airport and knew his flight details.
 
 The CCTV footage of the area is being scanned to ascertain the identity of the accused and the registration details of the motorcycles. Police have also probed the journalist’s friends and family members to obtain more information about the incident.
