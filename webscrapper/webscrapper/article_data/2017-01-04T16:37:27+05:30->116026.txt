HYDERABAD: With the Centre's demonetisation drive making a dent in their earnings, roadside vendors in the city are fast joining the cashless economy bandwagon to stay afloat. Many who were clueless about how to shift to digital payments are taking the help of their neighbours, children or fellow traders to enable them to 'log in'. 

 Many of these new converts spent a while desperately trying to retain customers before deciding to go with the digital flow. Shivanagaraj, a seller of tender coconuts at  , asked his son to download the   app on his mobile after seeing bigger shops reaping the benefits of the e-wallet. He had initially thought of applying for a POS machine, but postponed the idea as it would be a cumbersome process.
 
 Mohammad Ayub, a puncture repair shop owner in  , did not face a lack of customers but was being forced to make do with lower earnings, even working for free at times. "I faced a lot of problems for about 15 days. I could not turn away customers who came with a flat tyre, but even after a whole day of work I wasn't taking home much money. People started asking if I can accept card payments. I then tied up with a petrol bunk nearby, allowing me to accept payments through their swipe machines and Paytm account," he said. 
 
 He saw the advantage almost immediately, with customers coming even from far off places to get their vehicles repaired. "I hadn't applied for a POS machine or Paytm account as I didn't know how to use them. But now, I'm going to get my own," Ayub added.
 
 Fruit stall owners at Sri Ram Nagar,   and her husband Shankar Challamala, too are reaping the benefits, making 2,000 daily via Paytm. 
 
 Paytm came to the rescue of   too, a roadside cigarette shop owner in  . "Once I started accepting Paytm money, my customers returned. It works well for me too as I transfer the money to my bank account directly when I reach a lump sum in the Paytm account," he said.
