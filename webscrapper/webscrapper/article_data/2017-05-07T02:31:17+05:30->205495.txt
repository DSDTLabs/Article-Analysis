NEW DELHI: Taking a serious view of increasing incidence of cases of  , the   has directed setting up of child care institutions to look after children, particularly those who are victims of sexual offences, and also those who are in conflict with law. 

  A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta directed that all such child care institutions be registered by December 31. It also wanted governments to ensure a care plan for every child in each care institution by 2017-end. The bench also appealed to judges to play an active role in protecting the rights of children. It asked all HCs to set up a   to ensure effective implementation of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. 
 
 The bench also referred to a Unicef-Govt study of 2007 which said nearly 53% of children in India had been victims of sexual abuse. 
 
 "It is time for all of us to now realise that judges are no longer required to remain in an ivory tower. Judges of all the courts, including the constitutional courts, have non-judicial duties and obligations to perform so that the fundamental rights of the people are respected," the bench said.
 
 The court said it is a constitutional obligation of HCs to appoint a committee of judges to oversee the implementation of the Act. "The responses(of state governments) were disheartening then and the situation has not changed substantially even after almost a decade since this court took cognizance of the matter. Progress, if any, has been marginal. Unfortunately, it appears the governments of some states and UTs have little remedial or pro-active concern for children," the bench said.
