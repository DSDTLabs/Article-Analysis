SURAT: A doctor in Dharampur town   claimed to have removed a single stone weighing 1.4kg from the bladder of a patient last Wednesday.

 Dr Dhiru Patel, who runs Shri Sainath Hospital in Dharampur town, claimed that the single stone happens to be the largest in India and that the   was of 1.9kg stone removed from a patient in Brazil. 
 
 Forty-five-year-old  , who is employed as a clerk in State Bank of India’s (SBI) Kaprada branch, had visited Dr Patel’s hospital complaining difficulty in passing urine on April 5. 
 
 The report of sonography suggested presence of a huge foreign body in the bladder of the patient. The doctor decided to operate him. After 1.5-hour-long operation, a single stone weighing 1.4kg was removed from the urinary bladder of the patient. 
 
  Patel told TOI, “The patient complained of burning sensation in the urinary tract while passing the urine. He was also not feeling any heaviness due to the presence of the big stone. We checked all the details on internet about the bladder stone. I found the single stone recorded by Guinness World Records weighed 1.9kg of a patient in Brazil. In India, only 834gm stone was removed from a patient in Jammu & Kashmir. This stone weighing 1.4kg removed from my patient’s body is India’s largest one.”
 
 Dr Patel is a known face across Valsad district. He is younger brother of sitting MP from Valsad, K C Patel. Dr Patel had contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2009 on BJP ticket but lost to Congress’ Kishan Patel.
