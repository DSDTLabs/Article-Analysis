DEHRADUN: After   and   soldiers, an   jawan took to the online platform to voice his grievances against service conditions of soldiers, alleging that jawans were “being misused by senior officers”. Lance naik Yagya Pratap Singh, who is from the 14 Rajput regiment, was posted at the 42 Infantry Brigade in Dehradun till December last year and was recently transferred to the Rajput Regimental Centre at Fatehgarh in UP.

 In the video, which went viral soon after it was posted on Thursday, Singh claimed, “I have observed that soldiers who perform sahayak duty are actually just walking dogs or children or washing cars. I wrote about this to PMO, defence ministry and several other authorities after which I was harassed by senior officers.”
 
 He alleged that he was also threatened with a court martial and labelled anti-national by many of his seniors when he aired his grievances. “I have never done sahayak duty and I know this is not the correct method of complaining but I am doing this only for the greater good of other soldiers,” Singh said.
 
 He added that he was forced to post the video after complaints sent to the PMO and chief of   staff went unheeded. Taking cognizance of Singh’s grievance, Army chief General Bipin Rawat said in a media briefing in New Delhi on Friday, “We will conduct an enquiry in the matter but at the same time I would prefer if matters are resolved internally rather than being posted on social media.
 
 Direct communication is encouraged in the armed forces and any troop facing any issue must approach the authorities directly.” Singh’s wife Richa told TOI from their hometown Rewa: “Senior officers have taken away my husband’s mobile phone, which had videos showing how soldiers are subjected to menial tasks by officers.” “I feel proud that he raised his voice for other soldiers,” she added.
