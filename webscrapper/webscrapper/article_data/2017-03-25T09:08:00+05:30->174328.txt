A 41-year-old “serial bride“ and her mother have been arrested from Mulund for duping an   into marrying her using a  , and then demanding Rs 50 lakh to give him custody of their young son a couple of years later.

 The Ahmedabad police said they arrested Anshu Jaisal and her mother, Kamla, following a complaint by Ravi Brahmbhatt, a courier firm owner in the Gujarat capital who married her in November 2013 after seeing her profile on a matrimonial website.
 
 An Ahmedabad police officer said, “Our probe has revealed Anshu had got married at least twice earlier, including to a Sales Tax official in Varanasi.“
 
 Anshu's con job came undone when Ravi overheard her tell her mother, in 2014, that she cannot get the marriage registered as she's already married. When the Brahmbhatts confronted her, she insisted it was her first marriage. The family then did an online search only to find some profiles of her showing she was married earlier in Varanasi.“We gave advertisements in newspapers with her photo which yielded several inquiries confirming our suspicions. A visit to the registrar of marriages provided the proof that she had got married earlier,“ Ravi's bother Rakesh said.
 
 As troubled mounted, Anshu fled with her two-year old son, some cash and 200 gm gold jewellery that the Brahmbhatts had given her during her marriage. They alleged she refused to meet them and asked for Rs 50 lakh to give them custody of her son. “She threatened to abandon him on Mumbai roads if we didn't pay her,“ they said.
 
 As Anshu's online profiles mentioned her as an unmarried woman from UP settled in Mumbai, police teams were sent to both places. The duo was finally arrested from Mulund recently and taken to Ahmedabad.
