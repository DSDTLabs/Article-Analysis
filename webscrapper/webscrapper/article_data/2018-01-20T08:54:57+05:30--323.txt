NEW DELHI: The lure to create extra posts that run the risk of attracting 
  often stems from the limitation of ruling dispensations to accommodate the desire of MLAs to be inducted in the council of ministers. 

 
 
 The problem is more pronounced in smaller states like Delhi, where Article 239 AA of the Constitution mandates that the size of the council of ministers should not exceed 10% of the total strength of the assembly. 
 
 For other states, the ceiling for number of ministers is a little higher at 15% of the assembly’s strength. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 While there exists a legal window for declaring the extra posts for MLAs outside the purview of ‘office of profit’ as defined under Article 102 of the Constitution , the Delhi government, in a hurry to reward 21 MLAs with plum posts, 
  . It was only with retrospective effect that it passed a bill to exempt the post of   from ‘office of profit’ tag. 
 
 The bill was subsequently declined presidential assent. 
 
  
  
  
 
 Earlier governments in Delhi too had the post of parliamentary secretary. When the sole MLA appointed as parliamentary secretary by the   was told that this could attract his disqualification, he chose to resign. 
 
 Even the 
  appointed parliamentary secretaries, but the constitutionality of the these posts was never challenged. 
 
 “I chose to challenge the appointment of 21   MLAs as parliamentary secretaries. Many high courts have quashed such appointments when challenged,” Delhi lawyer  , who moved the petition seeking disqualification of the 20 (earlier 21) AAP MLAs, told TOI. 
 
 For instance, the appointment of parliamentary secretaries has been stayed or quashed by the Calcutta HC (2015), Goa bench of Bombay HC (2009), Himachal Pradesh HC (2005) and Chhattisgarh HC(2017).
