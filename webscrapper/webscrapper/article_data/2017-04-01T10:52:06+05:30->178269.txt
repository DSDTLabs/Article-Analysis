PUNE: Around 1,600 liquor vends, including hotels and  , may have to shut shop in Pune   following the Supreme Court’s modified order on Friday banning such vends within 220m on national and state highways having a population of up to 20,000.

 The earlier ban was for liquor vends within 500m on highways, which had put a question mark on the existence of around 1,500 liquor vends. After Friday’s order, around 100 more will be affected.
 
 Superintendent of State Excise department (Pune) Mohan Varde told TOI that they have issued 2,368 licenses for liquor vends and hotels that serve liquor. 
 
 “We had readied the list of nearly 1,500 liquor vends to be   down within 500 meters as per the December order and now after this order we have to recalculate but we estimate that another 100 will be affected, taking the total number to 1600,’’stated Varde.
 
 President of Hoteliers Association Ganesh Shetty said that with the new order, 90% of liquor vends, especially hotels, will be affected.
 
  “We estimate nearly 1,780 of our restaurants will be affected though they are on roads within the corporation limits. The roads have not been denotified on the records and are shown as highways. The corporation maintains the roads and PWD and collector have stated that the roads do not belong to the state or national highways. However, because the roads have not been denotified, these shops stand to be affected,’’ Shetty said.
 
 He said that once they receive the order, they would approach the government for further action.
