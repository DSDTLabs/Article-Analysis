NEW DELHI: The   of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday approved relief to the traders by reducing the   rates of shops in the so-called ‘refugee markets’. The markets were developed by the Land and Development Office for   who came here during the Partition.

 There are 29 such markets included in the proposal. Revision will witness a large drop in the licensing fee. The resolution passed states that the earlier revised rates should be withdrawn, and “all dues be collected from shopkeepers at old rates and policy be framed in this regard.”
