The complications of DM can be acute (developing over hours to days) and chronic (weeks to months).The acute complications include Diabetes Ketoacidosis and Hyperosmolar syndrome for which admission to the hospital is needed. The chronic complications are microvascular â€“ neuropathy (damage to nerves), retinopathy (involvement of retina of eye), nephropathy (kidney disease) and macrovascular -cardiovascular (heart), cerebrovascular (brain) and peripheral vascular disease (blood vessels of extremities).
