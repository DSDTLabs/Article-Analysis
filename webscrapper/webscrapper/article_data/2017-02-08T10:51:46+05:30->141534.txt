JAIPUR:   (ACB) on Tuesday claimed to have   running into crores of rupees involving the sale of   from   in the city.

 It is alleged that LED bulbs were supplied to Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) at an unreasonably high price. The deal was facilitated by a private contractor, ACB officials said.
 
 “Initial investigations reveal that the contractor sold to PHED a 15 watt bulb at Rs 15,000 apiece, a 9 watt bulb at Rs 972, and a 12 watt bulb at Rs 12,000,“ additional superintendent of police (ACB), Bagrang Singh Shekhawat told TOI.
 
 The officials at the Malviya Nagar unit of Central Store cleared the contractor's bill worth Rs 2 crore without verification, the ACB said.
 
 “First, Central Store is not allowed to sell LED bulbs.Second, Central Store has to invite tenders for any purchase or sale worth Rs 1 lakh or above. In this particular case, we have so far not found any document that suggests that a tendering process was adopted,“ Shekhawat said. He said PHED officials through CS purchased these bulbs from the contractor without paying any attention to the rules and regulations. “The bulbs belonged to some littleknown company, and we suspect the bulbs are substandard,“ Shekhawat said. As per the rules, PHED is required to in vite bids for any purchase beyond Rs 50,000, he said, which means that “the purchase was done though Central Store“.
 
 Officials of the Malviya Nagar unit of Central Store denied any knowledge of the sale.
 
 “We suspect that this scam runs into crores of rupees as several district circles of PHED purchased these bulbs though Central Store,“ Shekhawat told TOI.
