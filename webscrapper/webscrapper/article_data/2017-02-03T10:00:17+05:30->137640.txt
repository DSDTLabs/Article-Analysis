NAGPUR: Sitting   corporator   landed in trouble for some time after the civic body refused to issue him no-dues certificate. Dhawad, who owns a bar in   area, has defaulted the corporation’s water dues since 2012 and it accumulated to around Rs 1.98 lakh. But after he cleared the dues, the civic body issued no-dues certificate, known as NOCs.

 Dhawad confirmed of clearing all the dues. Altogether 500 aspiring candidates, including 135 sitting corporators have applied to the   to obtain no-dues certificates by Thursday evening. However, of them, around 119 corporators have taken the certificates till Thursday evening.
 
 It is mandatory to get NOCs from the civic administration for those who will contest the civic elections. The NMC has also set up a ‘single window’ exclusively to provide NOCs to the candidates in all the 10 zones.
