BENGALURU:   are a few months away but BJP is marking and counting its supporters already, one house at a time. 

  Under a drive called 'Vistaarak', the party has pressed its 35,000 workers across the state to visit each household, interact with residents and should they agree, affix a saffron sticker on their door. 
 
  Lingamurthy, 48, is used to sticking posters and putting up banners as a state BJP worker for the past 15 years. Now, in a first, he interacts with residents in  , identifying party loyalists and supporters and marking their homes. He and his team have been told to popularise the achievements of the Modi government at the Centre and ensure its message reaches the people. Once the family is convinced or expresses its support, Lingamurthy puts up the sticker on the door or wall of their house, "tagging" them as supporters. 
 
 The rectangular sticker carries slogans of BJP ideologue   alongside his portrait and those of Modi, BJP national president Amit Shah and the party's CM candidate,  .
