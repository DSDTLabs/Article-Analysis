 The issue of banning the events at Shaniwarwada was raised in the general body meeting on Tuesday. The elected members demanded an explanation from the civic administration on how and why the prohibition was imposed.

Any decision about its usage should be taken in consultation with the elected members. But it has not happened in this case. So a ban will not be imposed on programmes and events will continue to be held there,” she said.
