PUNE: The Bombay high court has directed an interim stay on the Pune cantonment magistrate’s order of March 20 that issued criminal process against Royal Western India   (RWITC), Pune, and six of its office-bearers over a complaint of wrongful restraint, cheating, misappropriation, and outraging modesty, lodged by a woman catering service provider. 

 In June last year, the magistrate had responded to a private complaint by caterer   (59), and directed the Wanowrie police to lodge an FIR and probe the matter. The police filed a report stating there was no evidence and no case was made out against the people named in the FIR. 
 
 The cantonment court, however, rejected the police report and directed Chinoy to lead her evidence in the case on October 14 last year. After recording her evidence, the magistrate passed the impugned order directing the process for wrongful restraint, assault and the use of criminal force to outrage modesty of a woman against two RWITC office-bearers, and for misappropriation, criminal breach of trust and cheating against the RWITC and four other office-bearers. The case was due for hearing before the magistrate on Friday.
 
 Lawyer   filed a couple of applications on behalf of the RWITC and its office-bearers to quash the cantonment court’s order. The applicants argued that the magistrate’s order was illegal and against the principles of natural justice, and that it was passed without the application of judicial mind and gave no reason explaining how the complainant’s allegations constitute a prima facie case. 
 
 In an order on May 2, Justice   of the   directed notices to the state and the respondents, returnable in eight weeks.
