JAIPUR: Amid the controversy over   for chief minister  , the   claimed on Friday that the specifications were tailored keeping in mind that the plane could be rented out for commercial operations too. 

 According to the reports,   government floated tender with specifications that would made the aircraft most powerful executive mid-size jet used by any politician, including prime minister, for domestic travel. Tender issued on November 28, 2016 called for plane with 3,200 nautical miles range - that could fly up to Europe and with service ceiling of 41,000 feet. 
 
 Putting a feeble defence, officials claim they were looking for a plane not to be exclusively used by the CM. “Intention to get high-end jet was using it on the national as well as international routes. There are many international charted flights that land in the state and there are ample opportunities to explore that market” said an official. 
 
 State government political VIPs typically don't use aircraft with high-performance parameters such as those sought by the Rajasthan government. Concerned officials, though maintained that state  , purchased or hired in future will be put in use as air taxi. Along with it if need occurs, VIP place will also airlift police personnel’s and troops. 
 
 People privy to the development also refuted the allegations that demanding a powerful aircraft with a 3600 nautical miles range was unnecessary. All mid-size aircrafts in the country are ranged near about these specifications. “Most airplanes in this category come with service ceiling of about 35,000 feet and 2600-3200 nautical miles. We have not asked for anything extravagant” added the concerned official. 
 
 However, no private firm has applied for the long term contract with the state government. The general administration department is now planning to lower the specifications to get some players onboard.
