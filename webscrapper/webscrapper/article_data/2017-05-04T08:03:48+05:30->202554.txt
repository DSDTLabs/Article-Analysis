LUCKNOW: The weights and measures department of the state government had alerted oil marketing companies more than two years ago about cases of a device being inserted in oil dispensing machines. However, companies kept mum on the issue and never responded to the department if they were taking any measures.

 In 2014, a case was reported from   that a petrol pump was using a chip to dispense lesser fuel than the price the customer was paying. The weights and measures department sent a letter—number 1892, dated November 17, 2014—to the general managers of all three oil marketing companies.
 
  in Lucknow, Bharat Petroleum Corporation in Noida and   in New Delhi were alerted to be vigilant to see that no such chip or device was inserted in the machine. 
 
 The letter said the department had noticed the presence of an additional chip in dispensing machines leading to complaints of short-change. “Whenever an oil company is taking permission for repair of dispensing machine, the company’s representative should ensure that no additional device is inserted inside the machine,” the letter said. 
 
 Deputy controller of the department OP Singh said, “The companies didn’t respond to us on that letter. So, we ourselves verified the pumps one by one but couldn’t detect any tampering at that time as the chip is remote-controlled and can easily be switched off at the time of inspection.” 
 
 He added that the department checks genuineness of machines only through the weight of fuel dispensed in their standard measuring container. “If the machine is yielding correctly, it doesn’t give a chance of suspicion,” he said.
