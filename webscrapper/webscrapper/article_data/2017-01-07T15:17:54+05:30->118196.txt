 has revealed that she had her husband  's face tattooed on her side. 

 The 38-year-old actress - who has two-year-old twins Bowie and Cy with her spouse Marco Perego - said she got an inking of the artist on her side, to match the tattoo of her face that Marco has on his arm.
 
  
  
 Speaking on 'The Late Late Show With  ', she said: "We're those kind of people. Oh, come on, be happy for us. He's had my face on his arm, so it's only fair. You want it to be in a place that's private, that you only show when you're, like, in a bathing suit. We had this amazing artist,  , do the tattoo for us. And I've been wanting to get it for two years...But I finally got it. Because my husband has tattoos coming out of his ears, and every time we would go get a tattoo for me, he would, like, push me aside, and he would end up getting a brand new tattoo. So, two years later, I finally got the tattoo."
