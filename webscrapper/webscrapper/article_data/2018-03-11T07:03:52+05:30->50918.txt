DHARAMSHALA: Invited as the chief guest,   food and civil supplies minister   chose to skip an official function of the Tibetan government on Saturday, organised to mark the 59th Tibetan National Uprising Day. 

 With this, Kapoor became the first minister of the state to have skipped the function in spite of an invitation from the Tibetan government in exile. The minister and Tibetan officials evaded queries on the matter.
 
 The function was organized at Tsuglagkhang (the main temple of the Dalai Lama at Mcleodganj) on Saturday. It remained low key, owing to the controversy due to which   (CTA) had to cancel its ‘Thank You, India’ event in Delhi on March 31 and April 1. 
 
 The ‘Thank You, India’ event was cancelled after the ministry for external affairs (MEA) advised government dignitaries to stay away from the campaign, keeping in view the crucial juncture at which India-China relations are at present.
 
 After the advisory, the event was shifted from New Delhi to Dharamshala. 
 
 Only BJP MP George Baker was present at the event.
