ERODE: Farmers of   on Friday petitioned the district collector,  , seeking action against illegal dyeing unit owners for discharging untreated effluents into the Lower Bhavani canal and blocking its pathway by dumping garbage. They said this has affected the water flow adversely. 

 The district administration had recently started releasing water through both the left and the right side canals on alternative days for irrigation purposes. One of the canals flows through Modakkuruchi and   villages. The farmers alleged that they are yet to receive the water. “The water flow has been hit very badly. Its colour has changed,” said  , a farmer. 
 
 Pointing out that the canal was the only source of irrigation for more than 15 villages, the farmers said, “But, the water is reaching only a few villages such as Rakkipalayam, Modakkuruchi, Pattaspali and Kovilpalayam. The remaining villages do not get water.”
 
 The farmers requested the collector take steps to remove the garbage and other encroachments from the canal to ensure normal water flow. The collector has directed PWD and pollution control officials to check the canal pathways and submit a report.
