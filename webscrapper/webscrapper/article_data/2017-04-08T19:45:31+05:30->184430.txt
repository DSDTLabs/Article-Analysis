BENGALURU: Photographer Mahesh Shantaram, who was on the panel discussing  , with former MP   and African students, speaks to TOI.

 Tarun Vijay was participating from India, while I was live in  's studio in Washington. When I first heard him, all I could think was, “Did he really say what he actually said?“ That is probably why I couldn't react to him during the show because I didn't believe that he had actually said those words.
 
 We were trying to present to the world that there is racism in India. Tarun Vijay, who I think was representing Indian patriarchy, made it seem like his ego was extremely wounded with all this talk of racism. He sounded like a patriarch who tells us that we shouldn't talk ill of your family. His arguments ­ that we cannot have racism because we have been fighting racism against the British or that we worship a black god - were specious. 
 
 I was disturbed by his response because he reconfirmed the concerns that I have always had about India - that we don't acknowledge that we have a problem. How can you even begin to address a problem when you refuse to acknowledge that it exists?
 
 The world is looking at India because (the issue of racism) is a matter of huge embarrassment. Voices like Tarun Vijay's are India's nationalist consciousness speaking. Even   refused to accept that racism exists in India. So did President Pranab Mukherjee in a talk to African ambassadors.
