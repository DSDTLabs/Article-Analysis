PUNE: Infrastructure projects in the city are likely to receive a major boost with the   (PMC) bagging top rank (AA+ rating) in the   list issued by the Union urban development ministry.

 The civic body now plans to attract investors with its rating and raise funds by issuing municipal bonds.
 
 AA+ rating is an indication of a high level of credit worthiness, which means that the civic body has the ability to return the money raised through loans and bonds. The credit rating also gives an indication of the financial performance of civic bodies. The PMC is looking for domestic and international investments for its projects.
 
 Civic chief Kunal Kumar said that the civic body will continue to perform the best on all fronts and attract investors. Some major infrastructure projects, including Pune Metro, BRTS, Ring Road and execution of development plan for old city, are slated to be launched this year.
 
 The credit ratings’ list, published by the Urban development department on Wednesday, states that credit ratings are assigned based on assets and liabilities of urban local bodies, revenue streams, resources available for capital investments, double entry accounting practice and other governance practices.
 
 Pune shares the top spot along with Navi Mumbai and   while Pimpri Chinchwad shares the third spot with Nashik, Surat and Thane civic bodies with AA- (4) rating.
 
 The press statement issued by the Union urban development ministry stated that during the review of progress of credit rating exercise taken by urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu, it was learnt that 55 of these cities have got ‘investment grade’ ratings. Naidu noted that with 59% of cities getting investment grade rating, the financial situation of urban local bodies in the country was better than it was thought of.
 
 The 94 cities that have been assigned credit ratings are spread across 14 states.
