MUMBAI: In a rare incident, a   bit a   on night duty on a vacant plot adjoining the salt pans in   (E) on Monday. The Pant Nagar police have alerted the forest officials, who have launched a hunt for the fox. “We have informed the forest officials who have laid a few traps in the  ,” said DCP (zone VII) Sachin Patil. 

 Locals said there have been fox attacks in the past that were not reported. The security guard, Rakesh Shukla (42), told TOI, that the fox had also attacked a youth playing football on an adjoining ground on Monday.
 
 To add to Shukla’s woes, he had to rush from one hospital to another as they did not have the injection to treat fox bite. “Around 8pm, I encountered the fox near the Ghatkopar mangroves. I panicked and started running, but it chased me for quite a distance. Soon I got tired, and stopped. I threw stones at the fox to drive it away, but it pounced on me, bit on my left arm and ran away,” said Shukla. 
 
 He rushed to the nearby Rajawadi Hospital. “The doctors said they do not have the injection to treat fox bites and told me to go to Sion hospital. But there too it was not available,” said Shukla. “I then went to a private hospital where I was told that the injection would cost Rs 6,000. I could not afford it as my monthly income is only Rs 8,000. I was then directed to JJ Hospital, where I was finally treated and sent home.”
