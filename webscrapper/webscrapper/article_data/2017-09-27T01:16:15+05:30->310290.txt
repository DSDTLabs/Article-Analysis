GAYA: A criminal case has been instituted against Tekari SDPO Manish Kumar. The FIR against the SDPO was lodged with the SC/ST police station on Monday under different sections of the IPC and SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The case has been lodged on the direction of the SC/ST special court as police had earlier allegedly refused to institute the case against the SDPO.   According to the complaint made by Devan Paswan, a villager of Panchanpur police outpost area, the SDPO not only passed casteist remarks against him taunting his humble social origins but also assaulted him inside the Panchanpur Outpost premises, a couple of months back.    Following the alleged refusal of the local police to register case against the officer, the complainant petitioned the SC/ST special court. The special court directed the police to file an FIR against the officer.    Being pre-occupied with the joint briefing for the Dussehra-Muharram law and order maintenance, SSP Garima Malik was not available for the official version and departmental action in the matter.    Earlier, a couple of weeks back, a trainee DSP was fined Rs 200 in Gaya for smoking at public place near the Vishnupad temple during duty hours.
