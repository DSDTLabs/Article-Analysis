KORAPUT: Reiterating their opposition to Prime Minister  's two-day visit to Odisha on April 15 and 16, Maoists have put up fresh posters in  . 

 Earlier, on March 30, the Red rebels had conducted two IED blasts at Daikallu railway station and put up posters and banners, opposing  's visit. 
 
 On Thursday, police recovered several Maoist posters, reportedly pasted by the Odisha state committee of the outlawed CPI (Maoist), from different areas of Sikarpai under   police limits.
 
 "We have seized several hand-written posters and verifying their authenticity. It could also be the handiwork of some mischief mongers. However, we can't be complacent and have intensified our anti-Maoist operations across the district to avoid any untoward incident," said SP (Rayagada) K Siba Subramani. Apart from opposing the prime minister's visit, the ultras urged tribals to throw away   from the area to save the Niyamgiri hill.
 
 "We urge the Dongria Kondh youths not to work as police informers and demand stopping of all type of combing operations in Niyamgiri hill," read one of the posters. 
 
 Arresting innocent tribals in false Maoist cases should be stopped, it read.
 
 The extremists had gone on the rampage at Daikallu railway station under Ambadola police limits in the district. 
 
 During their two-hour mayhem, the rebels had executed blasts at the station manager's room and an engine of a goods train.
