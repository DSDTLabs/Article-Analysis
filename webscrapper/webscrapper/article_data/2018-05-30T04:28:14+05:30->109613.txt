AHMEDABAD: A team of city police’s cyber cell apprehended a man from New Delhi for duping a city-based doctor of Rs 5.57 lakh in an online fraud. Investigators believe the man could be involved in similar cases at other places in the country.

 Cyber cell officials said Dr  , who lives near the   road, got a call from a masked phone number where the caller promised him a job at a research facility of an international company based in Miami, Florida in the US. The job involved annual remuneration of Rs 1 crore. The caller asked   to register himself at a website, jobseekers.in, after paying Rs 6,900 online.
 
 “Over the next few days, Desai was asked to pay Rs 5.57 lakh and complied. He later realized he was being duped and approached the cyber cell. The investigation began on the basis of the three email ids used by the accused and the website’s domain host. All were found to be connected to New Delhi-based Rudraksh  . A team visited Delhi and apprehended the proprietor,  , a resident of Palam,” said a cyber cell official.
 
 Investigators said Ghosh opened three bank accounts, in his and his mother’s name, where he would receive the money through transfers.
