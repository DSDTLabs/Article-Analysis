LUCKNOW: Chief minister Aditya Nath   on Wednesday warned   to refrain from lobbying for contracts to their personal  . He said work suffers only when people’s representatives ensure contracts to personal contractors. 

 He also reiterated that contractors with criminal antecedents would not be allowed to take contracts. The CM was intervening during the Question Hour over a supplementary by   leader Ajay Singh ‘Lallu’ on how bundhs would be repaired before June 15. 
 
 “I have directed officials to check the credentials of all contractors and not provide any contract to criminals or people who are known for their corrupt practices,” the CM said. He said the government is concerned about the annual menace of floods in the state and has directed officials concerned to complete all remedial measures before the advent of monsoon.
 
 “We have identified all flood-prone areas and there is no paucity of funds to take up the preventive measures.
 
 The CM also advised Lallu Singh to visit the Elgin Bridge bundh spot instead of making statement on the basis of reports on paper and see how much work has been done. 
 
 Replying to another question, parliamentary affairs and urban development minister Suresh   said work for the Ganga cleaning has begun under the   project. He said there are 247 drains that flow in the river in 27 districts from where the Ganga passes. Work on checking their flow in the Ganga at several drains is also underway, Khanna added.
