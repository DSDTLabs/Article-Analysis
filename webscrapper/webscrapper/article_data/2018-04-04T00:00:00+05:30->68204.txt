Seems like the month-long strike in   has given   a chance to reconnect with her rural roots. The actress, who has just returned from a trip to her native village in  , tells us that she’s happy to have relived her childhood. 

 “I’m from  , which is about seven hours-drive away from Hyderabad. Our family is into farming, and my grandfather had a huge farm there. After retirement, my father decided to go back to our home town and take up farming, like my uncle. So, when I had free time in hand, I went to my village,” says Bindu, adding, “When kids used to go to summer classes during vacation, I used to come to my village every year without fail. I learnt swimming in the pond instead of a pool, and I used to climb up the hills surrounding our village, with the food my grandmother packed for me, instead of trekking to some fancy place. I learnt so many valuable things in life from here. We don’t think much of the village way of life, but there’s nothing satisfying than spending time amidst nature and learning things from your own experience.”
