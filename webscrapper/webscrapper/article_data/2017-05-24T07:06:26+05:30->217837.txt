PUNE: The   on Tuesday extended the deadline to install   till October 31.

 A letter in this regard was issued from the transport commissioner’s office in Mumbai.
 
 Reacting to the decision, a cab driver said, “This is a good decision because we need time to understand the entire system first. Also, the RTO ( ) needs to tell us clearly about the norms and the ways to install the speed governors and from which place.”
 
 Earlier, the transport department had directed that speed governors should be installed in the cabs from May 1. The Pune RTO officials had stated that they would not provide fitness certificates to the cabs not having speed governors.
 
 The ministry of transport had notified the order following a Karnataka high court directive in February 2016. The ministry had exempted the taxis. The move was challenged in the high court, which stated that the exemption was illegal. The norm had triggered a protest in Mumbai and the cabbies in Pune were also not happy about it.
