CHENNAI: When   take on Rajasthan Royals in Pune on Friday night in their fourth match of the ongoing   season, they will have an army of supporters from across the world cheering them on. At the Gahunje stadium as well, the yellow brigade will be in full strength to back the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side.

 
 In a move that will warm the   hearts, the Chennai Central station - on Thursday morning - saw a mad rush of fans of the side. The franchise’s loyal fans numbering over 1,000 boarded a special train named -   - to Pune and members of the management too were present to see the fans off.
 
 The initiative, undertaken by the franchise as a goodwill gesture, will see the fans being provided with complimentary passes for Friday’s contest, in addition to free food and accommodation in Pune. “This is an unprecedented move by the CSK to reward its fans who have been a constant source of support. The fans have always been behind the team through thick and thin. I am sure the fans’ prayers and the talent CSK possesses will help them regain the coveted trophy,” said Saravanan, one of the fans of the team.
 
 Chennai Super Kings came into the competition after a two-year hiatus and played the campaign opener against Kolkata Knight Riders at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. However, Cauvery protests in the city forced the franchise to shift their ‘home’ from Chennai to Pune for the remainder of the season.
