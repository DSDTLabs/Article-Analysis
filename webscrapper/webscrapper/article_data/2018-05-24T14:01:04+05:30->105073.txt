SURAT:  ,  , raised prices for rough diamonds for the third consecutive sight amid strong consumer demand in its May sales cycle. 

 De Beers sold $550 million worth of goods at its May sales cycle as strong consumer demand boosted   market. 
 
 According to the US-based Rapaport Group, the miner raised prices for the third consecutive sight amid the strong demand, with an emphasis on larger categories. De Beers made certain price changes by adjusting the way it sorts stones into boxes. 
 
 “We saw a robust demand for De Beers’ rough diamonds, reflecting continued strong demand for diamond jewellery, especially from American consumers, as we head towards the important JCK Las Vegas trade show at the start of June,” De Beers chief executive officer Bruce Cleaver said on Tuesday. 
 
 Dealer premiums — the markup at which traders can sell De Beers rough on the secondary market —crept up to 4.9% in May from 4.4% in April, according to a report by Dudu   of diamond broker Bluedax. “Rough diamonds are in short supply, prompting traders to ask for higher prices in the secondary market,” Harari said. 
 
 However, midstream profits remain low as increase in rough prices does not correspond to polished demand, even amid positive consumer sentiment, sources noted. 
 
 Diamantaires in Surat are worried as skyrocketing   have drastically reduced their profitability at the end sale of the polished diamonds. 
 
 “The market sentiments may be good, but our profitability is lost due to increase in rough diamond prices. The dealer margin in the secondary market has increased due to shortage of goods in certain category,” said a diamond manufacturer.
