 it will be. The   ( ) seems to have finalised on former England batsman for the annual MAK Pataudi Lecture. The lecture will be held in Bangalore on June 12.

 
 Pietersen’s name was zeroed in on after attempts to rope in Kumar Sangakkara and Nasser Hussain did not succeed. The two former international captains will be busy with commentary assignments with London’s Sky Sports channel for the England-Australia white ball series.
 
 The choice of speaker was itself asubject of debate among different factions of the BCCI – Committee of Administrators, members and the BCCI management. Acting secretary   had taken objections to the four names suggested by Saba Karim, a key member of the BCCI management.
 
 But the Supreme Court-appointed CoA has given him the goahead with the plans. The BCCI management suggested the names of Sourav Ganguly, Sangakkara, Hussain and Pietersen. Sources say the South Africaborn former England captain is expected to be finalised. The announcement is expected soon.
 
 There have been three topics suggested for the lecture -- Peace and sustainability through Cricket, behaviour and conduct of international players in the modern age (a players perspective) and Cricket as an Olympic Sport — way forward.
 
 But the BCCI is yet to confirm the topic.
 
 The timing of the annual lecture – started by the BCCI in 2013 – will coincide with the historic Test match between India and Afghanistan, which will be playing their first-ever five-day match (from June 14). The BCCI awards also will be presented that day (June 12).
 
 Meanwhile, late Pataudi’s wife Sharmila Tagore confirmed to Mirror that she will be attending the event in Bangalore. “I have been informed by Saba Karim and will be there,” the veteran Bollywood actor said.
