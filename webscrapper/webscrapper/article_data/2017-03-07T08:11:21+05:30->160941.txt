NEW DELHI: The   sought explanations on Monday from the Centre and the   (RBI) on why citizens had been denied the opportunity to deposit scrapped currency till March 31 as promised by Prime Minister   while announcing the 
  on November 8 last year.

 A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar, Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul issued notices to the Centre and RBI, asking them to respond on March 10 when the matter will be taken up for hearing.
 
 The SC passed the order on a bunch of petitions accusing the Centre of breach of promise as the PM had assured that the scrapped notes could be deposited in RBI branches till March 31.
 
 After the Centre’s ordinance restricting deposit of old notes to only those citizens who were abroad from November 8 to December 30, members of armed forces posted in other states and others who had valid reasons for not depositing their money during the given period, a bunch of petitions questioned the Centre’s decision to alter the assurance given by the PM in his address to the nation and in subsequent notifications issued by RBI.
 
 The petitioners said they were under the impression that those who failed to deposit the scrapped notes by December 30 could do so by March 31 at designated offices of the RBI. However, the Specified Bank Notes Cessation of Liabilities Ordinance breached the assurance as the RBI turned such people away leaving them with a substantial amount of money in old currency notes, they contended.
 
 “The present incident is a breach of trust committed by the   and its governing arms as they had issued a notification dated November 8, 2016 which had assured the people that if on account of some reasons, any person who is unable to exchange or deposit the bank notes on or before December 30, shall be given an opportunity to do so at specified branches of the RBI. A similar statement was made by the PM... while declaring demonetisation on November 8,” the petition said.
