NASHIK: The average wholesale price of onions has surged 118% over the past two weeks in Maharashtra, from Rs 571 per quintal on July 13 to Rs 1,250 on Thursday, an 18-month high.

 To stabilise the steady rise in the price of the kitchen staple, the Centre may increase its minimum export price (MEP).
 
 The Centre had withdrawn the $700/tonne MEP in December 2015 after a crash in wholesale prices. There has been no MEP for the past 19 months. “The Centre is keeping a close watch on onion prices in wholesale markets,” a government source told TOI.
 
 Members of the   (APMC) have attributed the price spurt to short supply on account of a lull in harvest. “Harvest of fresh kharif crop will begin only in mid-October. Currently, the onions arriving in the market are from old stocks. This is the crop harvested in March and April,” said an   official.
 
 Lasalgaon in   is the country’s biggest wholesale onion market. 
 
 The official said the district’s farmers, who are in financial trouble, preferred to store onions in the hope of getting better prices. He said that, in June,   received between 22,000 and 30,000 quintals of onions per day. 
 
 Over the past two weeks, the supply is 12,000-20,000 quintals. “This indicates that farmers have already sold the onions they had stored and they may have limited stocks now. Hence, the rise in price,” a source added.
 
 Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said, “The Madhya Pradesh government recently bought 80 lakh quintals following a rise in demand in the state. Moreover,   is reeling under floods and the the kharif crop areas have reduced. This has led to a rise in demand and average wholesale prices.
