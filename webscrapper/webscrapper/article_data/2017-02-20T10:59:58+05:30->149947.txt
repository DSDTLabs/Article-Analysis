NAGPUR: “The thoughts of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar take each one of us to the kingdom of righteousness,” said Sudhir Gavhane head of the department at  , Aurangabad, on Saturday.

 Delivering the concluding speech on ‘Buddha Dhammadiksha Ani Samajik Parivartan’ of the two-day lecture series organized by the postgraduate department of Dr Ambedkar Thought at university convocation hall, Gavhane said that Buddha laid stress on making mind pure and world righteous. When there is a combination of morality and nationality then you can create a new society, he said. There has been growing interest among the people about the thoughts of Dr Ambedkar and therefore it is time that his teachings are taken to every section of the society, he added.
 
 Gavhane said that Dr Ambedkar was a man of action who fought a battle for the rights of the poor and downtrodden in India. This is comparable in many ways to those fought by leaders like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela.
 
 “The purpose of Dhamma is to reconstruct the world and not to explain its origin,” said Gavhane. He said that “In many ways Dr Ambedkar tied India into a deeper form of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi did. Therefore, if you equate Gandhi with non-violence, then you have to equate Ambedkar too with non-violence.”
 
 Gavhane said that need for social justice is inevitable as it is the only weapon to take people towards their active participation in the development of the nation and added that Dr Ambedkar dreamt of a just society.
 
 Pradeep Aglave, head of Ambedkar Thought department, made the introductory remarks. SP Kane, vice-chancellor of  , presided. Ramesh Shambharkar conducted the function while SK Gajbhiye proposed a vote of thanks.
