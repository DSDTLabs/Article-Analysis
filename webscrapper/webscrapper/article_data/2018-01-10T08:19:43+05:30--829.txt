CHENNAI: Hindu Munnani leader,   has condemned lyricist Vairamuthu’s recent reference to Hindu deity ‘Andal’ being a ‘devadasi’ and wanted him to tender an apology for the remark. Participating in a function at a temple in Rajapalayam on Sunday, Vairamuthu delivered a lecture on Andal and her contributions to ancient Tamil through her work, Thiruppavai.

 During the course of his lecture, Vairamuthu referred to a book – ‘Indian Movement – some aspects of dissent, protest and reform’ - by   and brought out by the  , US. He cited a line from the book that said Andal was herself a devadasi who lived and died in  . 
 
 “The devotees may not agree. But, people against male chauvinism and rationalists will surely think about it,” Vairamuthu said. This was reproduced by him as an essay too and appeared in a Tamil daily, which organized the Rajapalayam function, on Monday.
 
 “It was neither a Dravidar Kazhagam meeting nor was it a platform of rationalists. What enamoured Vairamuthu, who speaks Tamil for his livelihood, to cast such aspersions on Andal,” Rama Gopalan wondered and demanded an apology from Vairamuthu.
