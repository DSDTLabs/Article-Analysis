AHMEDABAD: Air Officer Commanding (AOC) in Chief R K Dhir said on Friday that over the past seven years India has engaged in a programme to dissuade China and Pakistan from undertaking any misadventure. Dhir was responding to a question on the current tensions at the border, which was asked after his address at a curtain-raiser for an employment seminar for retired and retiring   personnel. 

 Dhir said that India takes a balanced view of the capabilities of defence forces. “Over the past five to six years, the government has made specific improvements in building roads to smoothen the movement of troops in the eastern region,” he said. “As far as Indian Air Force’s capacity to lift equipment and troops is concerned, you are aware that C-17 and C-130 military transport aircraft have been inducted into the force.”
 
 As for the employment fair — to be conducted on July 9 on the Kendriya Vidyalaya campus near   — Lt Colonel Nishit Sahay of the directorate general of resettlement said that as part of the MOU signed with the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), around 60 corporate houses will offer jobs.
 
 “Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Adani Green Energy Ltd, Larsen & Toubro, Aditya Birla Group and   International are among the participants,” said a senior Air Force official. 
 
 “We expect a turnout of about 2,300 retired and retiring defence personnel.”
 
 Station Commander E J Anthony said that candidates can apply online or at the venue. “After assessing skills, candidates will sent to relevant companies for interviews,” Anthony said.
