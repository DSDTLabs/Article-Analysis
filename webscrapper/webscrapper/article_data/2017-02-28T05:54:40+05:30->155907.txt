GUWAHATI: Rumours of a paper leak sent the Board of Secondary Education, Assam (Seba) into the defensive again, with Seba saying "unscrupulous elements" are targeting the   to malign its image and that of the state  . 

 
 The Class X general science question paper went viral on WhatsApp on Monday while students were taking the exam. According to sources in Seba, the question paper was circulated on mobile phones from a location in lower Assam's Dhubri district, which has the highest number of sensitive examination centres.
 
 The official stance, however, was that the paper had not technically been leaked since the exam was already underway. "The rumour of question paper leak is baseless. The exam started at 9am, and the question paper was circulated through WhatsApp an hour after the commencement of the exam. Anybody can be involved in circulating the question paper as many examinees came out of the exam centre after 10am. The exam process was not affected by this in any way," said education minister  . 
 
 A senior official of the board, too, said that a candidate can submit the answer script an hour after the exam commences.
 
 "Certainly some unscrupulous elements are hatching a conspiracy against Seba and the education department. When the examinees were taking the exam inside the examination centres, what was the use of circulating the same paper outside? It is a motivated attempt to drag the board into controversy," said the official. 
 
 Seba and the state education department faced severe criticism a few days ago after wrong question papers were allegedly distributed among examinees at two examination centres in Baksa and Hojai districts of Assam during the ongoing Class X state board exam.
