NEW DELHI: Even as troubles in the JD(U)-RJD alliance cast a shadow over its deliberations, the opposition could announce the name of a joint candidate for the vice-presidential poll following a meeting of several non-NDA parties here on Tuesday. 

 Though Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has decided to keep away from the 11 am meeting and is planning to address legislators and party functionaries in Patna instead, JD(U) MPs Sharad Yadav and K C Tyagi will attend, making it a total of 18 political parties. 
 
 Sources in the Left told TOI that while the opposition has not formalised the name of any vice-presidential candidate yet, there is a broad consensus on the person not being from the Congress camp after Meira Kumar's nomination as presidential candidate. 
 
  Sections in the opposition did not rule out the possibility of Dalit leader  's name for vice-president. A small section also said former West Bengal governor  , who was earlier among the top contenders for the opposition's presidential candidate, may find mention on the list of names during Tuesday's meeting. 
 
  There also seems agreement that with time running out, the opposition parties should announce their VP candidate even though the NDA government has not revealed its nominee. The Left has indicated it remains committed to contesting the poll even though the numbers are stacked in favour of the NDA nominee. A senior Left leader said they were even willing to consider a candidate with no political affiliation.
