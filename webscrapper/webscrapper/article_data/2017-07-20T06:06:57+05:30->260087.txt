HYDERABAD: With several road stretches being battered because of the incessant rains over the past two days, the Greater   ( ) has decided to take up road restoration work on a war footing. As per initial estimates, stretches over a road length of 300km were damaged, and engineers have now been asked to identify badly damaged roads for immediate restoration work and send a report to the headquarters. 

  secretary Navin Mittal held an emergency meeting with GHMC engineering officials on Wednesday night and directed them to fill potholes by Thursday night. Officials said 2,100 potholes were identified in all five zones. Mittal also served a 10-day deadline for road restoration work. He directed GHMC commissioner to blacklist contractors who failed to comply.
 
 "The cement concrete roads will take some more time as it involves technical and traffic issues," GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy told TOI on Wednesday. "As per procedure, municipal authorities have to call for tenders for works above 1 lakh. Since even short term tenders are a time consuming process, the works will be allotted to empanelled contractors," the commissioner said. 
 
 A couple of days ago, municipal administration minister   directed officials to allot works on a nomination basis without wasting time over the tendering process. He said the department would ratify all the decisions later. Following this, a meeting with all chief engineers on road restoration works was held in the municipal corporation on Wednesday.
 
  Each contractor would be given a stretch covering about two-three kms.  , where there are no drains and water logging is a major problem, would be dealt with separately on a priority basis. "Mostly, restoration works will be carried out during nights," a superintending engineer said. Since quality is often compromised during emergency works, GHMC has prepared a check list on the quality parameters.
