The male passengers had been pickpocketed as they entered the train while the female passengers had their phones snatched in the passage of the local. Later, a frequent commuter told me that the man who had looted my phone was seen on the same stretch for the past week and has been targeting other commuters. The police must act," said Tripathi.
