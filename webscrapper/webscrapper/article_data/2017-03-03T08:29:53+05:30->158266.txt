THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Economic Review tabled in the Kerala assembly on Thursday, on the eve of the LDF government's first full budget, underlined the need to overcome fiscal mismanagement and stagnation and to urgently work out a recovery strategy.

 The  , which prepared the review, revealed that the revenue deficit had come down to 1.36% in 2010-11, but after this growth in the state's tax revenue as well as other major revenue components were not buoyant enough to facilitate revenue-led fiscal consolidation. The fiscal deficit which represents the total resource gap had witnessed a steady rise in the last five years. In 2015-16 the revenue deficit was 1.65% of GSDP against 2.78% of GSDP in 2014-15.
 
 The state's own tax revenue showed a declining trend from 2011-12 to 2013-14 and from 2014-15 onwards it showed a slight upward trend. In 2015-16 it registered a growth of 10.68%.
 
 On the debt front, the outstanding debt liabilities of the state at the end of 2015-16 was Rs 157,370.33 crore. The annual growth rate of debt increased to 16.19% in 201516 from 13.81% in 2014-15. To tap resources to comply with the state government's obligations, the review reports says tax administration has to be optimised.
 
 On the effects of   on the state's economy, the review report said 56% of the state's   was immediately affected by the withdrawal of highdenomination notes. It also affected earnings from the tourism sector and in the flow of remittances, which are important drivers of growth in the state's economy. The ongoing contraction in GDP growth will be worsened by the cash crunch and result in reducing revenue collection and widen revenue and fiscal deficit gaps.
 
 The Economic Review, while emphasising strategic steps to return to the path of fiscal consolidation, makes it clear that a recovery from the present state of fiscal stagnation seems to be quite remote in the near future.
 
 Kerala as good as US in saving newborns
 
 Kerala's infant mortality rate (IMR) ­ the number of children under the age of 1 who die for every 1,000 born ­ has been brought down to 6, a level equal to that of the US and the average for the developed nations, according to the   (NFHS) of 2015-16, reports Rema Nagarajan. To put that number in perspective, if India, with a current IMR of 41 could get it down to 6, about 7 lakh children would be saved each year.
 
 Kerala had been struggling over the past decade to bring down the IMR to a single digit from 12 where it was stuck from 2009 onwards according to the Sample Registration Survey (SRS) conducted by the office of the registrar of census. In the last NFHS done in 2005-06, Kerala's IMR was 15. An IMR of 6 is lower than that of countries like Russia (8), China (9), Sri Lanka (8) and Brazil (15).
 
 Kerala continues to be way ahead of other Indian states on this measure, the closest big state to it being Tamil Nadu with an IMR of 21. Paediatricians and public health experts in Kerala, however, are more cautious than overjoyed. A dramatic fall to six is something they are skeptical about. With the falling number of births, they wonder if the number of infants in the overall NFHS sample for Kerala was adequate to measure IMR accurately.
