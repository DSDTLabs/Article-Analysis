KANPUR:   on Friday demanded that accused BJP MLA   be shifted from   to a   as there is a threat to her life and her family. She alleged that as some local jail officials are relatives of Sengar, her family would not be able to get justice. 

 Sengar was sent to Unnao jail on Friday after his seven-day CBI remand ended. The survivor also demanded that the case be transferred to Delhi as Sengar could influence the witnesses in Unnao.
 
 "It is the same jail (Unnao) where my father was killed. We will not get justice if Kuldeep Sengar is lodged here. He should be transferred to Delhi jail. Our family faces threat from him. We do not want to go back to our home in the village. These people (Kuldeep and his aides) will get me killed," the survivor said while talking to mediapersons in Unnao on Friday.
