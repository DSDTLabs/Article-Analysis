What would be a better way to pay tribute to your guru than mastering the art he has taught you and presenting in front of him? May be that’s why   percussionist come up with a two-day recital programme three years back, which now has become one of the major   instrument festival of the state. “Tabla   is a   to our gurus. When we thought of this concept back in 2014, we had one thing in our mind that rather than organising a formal programme, we would present the same art in front of our gurus to make them proud. We would dedicate a programme to them as there is no great offering than Sadhana,” says  , senior   player and one of the organisers of Tabla Chilla Festival. “2014 was 75th birthday of our gurus Pt Kamalakar Ware, Pt Nana Muley and Pt Narayan Joshi. Tabla Chilla percussion festival was then organised to honour them. Chilla means non-stop tabla recital for 40 consecutive days. Of course that was not possible, so we came up with a two-day programme. Today, tabla players from all over the country have participated in the event,” he further adds

  As many as 22 tabla players from country will be presenting their art in Nashik during the festival. “The concept of dedicating a recital to those gurus who have spent their lives in this field appealed to me very much. Festivals like this connect us to our roots and traditions. It’s a way to concentrate and later surrender to the music itself,” expresses  , a tabla player from Bhopal.
 
  
 
 
  The festival has witnessed percussionists aged between 12 to 70 years old and Nashikites are no less in supporting them. “On the first day, in the first session the auditorium was houseful. People were even standing outside,” says Aviraj Tayde, a city percussionist. “When you get such lovely audience, you feel blessed and encouraged,” shares Kalyan Pande, a disciple of Pt Suresh Talwalkar from Pune.
