Mumbai: Contrary to fears that   Narendra Modi’s new schemes launched on the eve of the New Year would leave a big dent on the country’s finances, a research by a State Bank of India economist showed that the cost to exchequer in the current fiscal could be just about Rs 3,500 crore. 

 On Saturday, the PM launched interest subvention in housing finance schemes for the people in the middle and low income categories,   for deposits by senior citizens, relief for farmer loans through interest subventions and also monetary benefits for pregnant women.
 
 The report from   pointed out that for relief to farmers on their loans, the total outgo is expected to be about Rs 1,600 crore, which forms the major part of the aggregate cost to the government. The cost to the government for the schemes on women and children is estimated to be Rs 1,200 crore while interest subventions in housing finance schemes for various categories of people is likely to dent the exchequer by about Rs 1,000 crore. “The overall fiscal impact of all these measure...is minimal when compared to the social and economic benefits,” the report by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser, SBI, noted. 
 
 The bank also suggested a few more measures to make the schemes more people-friendly. For example, SBI suggested that the senior citizens’ deposit scheme may be tweaked further by reducing the lock-in period to five years to align it with tax free status. On the other hand, the corpus size could be increased to at least Rs 15 lakh and the rate of interest may be a minimum of 8% or whatsoever prevailing in the market with a defined upper limit. On the government’s plan to hike the limit for sops on loans to micro, medium and small enterprises to Rs 2 crore, SBI suggested that along with the new loans, the government should extend this facility to existing loans at the time of renewal.
