The quitting saga continues on the daily soap ' '. After Additi Gupta,  , who is rumoured to be dating her, has also exited the show. Laksh says, “I wasn’t creatively satisfied and convinced with my track. I had certain expectations from my character, which did not materialise. I shot my last episode a week ago.”
The actor's personal life has been equally in the limelight as his personal life. After being linked to his former co-actor  , he was recently in the news for his growing proximity to Additi. It was even reported that Laksh was the reason behind Additi ending her five-year relationship with Rizwan Bachav. He states, “The problem is that I am young. The moment I befriend an actress, we get linked. Rashami is still a friend and we share a healthy relationship. It’s disappointing when I am linked to people. Mentioning Rashami’s age and stating that she is dating a younger guy is quite demeaning. It was reported that she left her home and mother for me. How is that possible? I am not a Casanova.”
 
  
  
 About Additi, he adds, “She was equally close to Arjun (Bijlani), but nobody would link her with him because he is married. What is so great about me that a girl will end her relationship of five years for me? I became mature quite early in life because of family circumstances. I connect better with elder people. My personal life isn’t my priority. I have managed to find my feet in the industry and can't allow my personal life to gain focus. I am single.”
 Meanwhile, Laksh has already been finalised to play the title role in Siddharth Kumar Tewary’s historical show, 'Porus'. So, did he quit one show for another? “I didn’t quit 'Pardes'... for 'Porus'. I had decided to quit the daily soap sometime ago and   materialised recently. It’s a sheer coincidence and nothing more,” he replies.
