PATNA: The nephew of a Patna high court judge was arrested allegedly in an inebriated state near Dharhara Kothi under the Kadamkuan police station area in the city on late Tuesday night. The man was identified as Mukesh Kumar.

 “Breathalyser test showed the presence of 90.6mg alcohol in Mukesh’s blood,” police sources. Mukesh, in his early 30s, was produced before the special court (prohibition) of judge Ramesh Chandra Malviya (ADJ-II), who forwarded him to 14 days’ judicial custody on Wednesday.
 
 It was only after his arrest when the police came to know that the high court judge was his maternal uncle, police sources said. 
 
 Kadamkuan SHO Ajay Kumar said police received information on Tuesday night about a brawl near one Sharma Lodge where a large number of students reside. When police reached the spot, Mukesh was found hurling abuses and creating ruckus while others had fled, he said. 
 
 “Mukesh was found to be in an inebriated state. He was brought to the police station. He tested positive for alcohol in the breathalyser test and was arrested,” Kumar said, adding that Mukesh and one of his uncles run the lodge.
 
 Police sources said an FIR was lodged against Mukesh over a written complaint by assistant sub-inspector Mithilesh Kumar Singh, who had visited the spot with a police team on getting information about the brawl, which took place on the issue of parking bikes in front of the lodge. The SHO said Mukesh was a native of Painal under the Bihta police station area, but had settled in Dharhara Kothi area.
