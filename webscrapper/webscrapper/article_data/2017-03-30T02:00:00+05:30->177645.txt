PATNA: Final   results of at least 60 students of the   have been withheld owing to non-payment of school fees.

 According to sources, the parents of these students did not pay the fees for over a year as a mark of protest against the hike in tuition fees. The school, which imparts education up to Class X, increased the tuition fees by 12.41% last year.
 
 Sources said the annual results of students in the classes from kindergarten to Class VIII were declared on March 27, but those of the 60 students had been put on hold.
 
 One of the parents said on Wednesday that the school in the last two years increased the fees by around 24%, which he could not afford to pay. “It was upped by 12% in 2015 and another 12.41% in 2016,” he said.
 
 Another parent demanded rollback. “Now the school says we will have to pay late fine along with the arrears. Even if I decide to pay up, I need time to arrange such a huge amount. However, if the school withholds my child’s result, it will spoil his educational career... I cannot even change the school as no school will give him admission without his report card,” he said.
 
 The school administration, on the other hand, said they were charging nominal fees in comparison to other private schools. “We did not stop the students from writing the exam, but they will have to clear the dues to get the report card,” school principal Rubina Hansda said on Wednesday.
 
 Hansda further said most of the classroom in her school had the Smart Class facilities. “The school has to maintain its state-of-the-art infrastructure. Also, the salary of teaching and non-teaching staff has to be increased every year. It all requires money,” she said.
 
 According to the school, there are around 3,000 students on its rolls while only a handful of parents have issues regarding the fee hike. “The annual tuition fee is Rs 12,200 from nursery to Class VIII. The late fine is Rs 50 per month. We don’t think this is exorbitant,” said a school official.
