GREATER NOIDA: A road accident in Greater   turned ugly, with a group of   associated with Gau Raksha Dal, Bajrang Dal and   (VHP) vandalising a black Hyundai Santro after spotting meat in the vehicle.

 However, no one was injured in the incident that took place near Tigri roundabout in Bisrakh on Monday evening as the two occupants of the car fled the spot leaving the vehicle behind, after their Santro hit a stationary  , injuring its driver, just minutes before the cow vigilantes gathered there.
 
 The cow vigilantes vented their anger at the abandoned Santro and damaged it. Later a police team reached the spot and seized the vehicle as well as the meat pieces. A case has also been registered at Bisrakh police station against unidentified persons, based on a complaint by Yogendra Singh Chauhan, Bisrakh block president of VHP.
 
 The incident comes despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi time and again making it clear that “killing in the name of cow worship is not acceptable”.
 
 “The Santro hit the WagonR and its driver got injured. Local people rushed him to a private hospital. Soon more people started gathering at the spot to find out about the accident. However, two occupants of Santro immediately got down from the vehicle and fled the spot,” said Chauhan.
 
 Chauhan, in the complaint, claimed people suspected foul play and checked the Santro only to find pieces of meat, which they suspected to be   and damaged the vehicle.
 
 Rajesh Kumar Sharma, SHO of Bisrakh police station, said, “There were some pieces of meat. It is not clear if the meat is beef. We have sent the meat sample for forensic examination and a report is awaited. We are trying to establish the identity of the vehicle owner.”
 
 Police also said the WagonR driver was later discharged from the hospital.
