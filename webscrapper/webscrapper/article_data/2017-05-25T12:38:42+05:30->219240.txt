Actress   says she hopes her three sons do not grow up 'feeling conscious' about the colour of their skin. The 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' star, who has two-year-old twins Cy and Bowie and three-month-old   with her husband Marco Perego, wants her children to grow up to believe they are capable of doing anything.

  
  
 "My greatest wish for my kids is that they never grow up feeling conscious of the colour of their skin, or where their parents come from or that they can achieve anything in life," said Zoe Saldana. The actress says her mother Asalia instilled the same positive thoughts into her as a young girl. 
 
 "She would always tell me, 'Zoe, Zoe, Zoe. I hope you like them' (when meeting new people). And for some reason, it was always to remind me what I have to feel and think about others matters just as much as what they have to feel and think of me."
