VADODARA: When he was in his first year of graduation,   came across a book written by the famous physicist   

 Jani read ‘Brief History of Time’ that he found from a roadside bookstall near M S University in the city. “By the time I finished reading the book, I had a sense of determination and a quest to march rest of the life for. I wanted to study black holes in our universe and Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity,” Jani told TOI. 
 
 “Three years after I had finished reading the book, I was doing research on black holes in 2010 in the Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics where Prof Stephen Hawking served as the research director. I used to see him around all the time,” Jani, one of the key members of the LIGO team that detected the gravitational waves, recalled. 
 
 “When we detected the gravitational waves, Hawking was the first person to call us and congratulate. It was a matter of great pride when I received medal for Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. That award was previously given to Hawking,” Jani, who is settled in the USA, said. 
 
 He had even met Hawking for a brief while when he was having lunch at the institute’s cafeteria. “Hawking’s staff approached me and asked if he can join for lunch on my table. I gathered some courage and told him that I joined physics because of his book and owe it to him for being an inspiration. A while later, a voice came from his computer ‘Thank you. I am very glad to see you here,” Jani said. 
 
 It was then that Jani understand how difficult it would have been for Hawking to pursue physics in his condition. “After Albert Einstein, Hawking is only the second scientist who made science popular among the masses,” Jani said.
