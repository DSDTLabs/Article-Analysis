PANAJI: With the issue of Bondvoll lake in St Cruz gathering the villager’s support, the century-old lake facing a serious threat from development activities is likely to become a major issue in the ensuing panchayat elections.

 A public meeting at the church square in St Cruz on Sunday discussed a few issues to protect the heritage dam and the people were urged to support only those panch members who are willing to back the movement to save it.
 
 Social activist Prajal Sakhardande, Fr Michael Fernandes, Peter Pires, former   Victor Gonsalves, Sudip Dalvi and Arturo D’Souza were among those who spoke on issues related to the protection of the lake. While the government has promised to support the people in protecting the lake, D’Souza hoped more proactive steps in restoring the damaged portion before monsoon would help prevent silting of the water body from debris lying around.
