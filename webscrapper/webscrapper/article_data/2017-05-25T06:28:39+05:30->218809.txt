KOCHI: The city police will soon issue a notice to all schools to form a   (SPG) for   from all kinds of abuses in their schools and outside. 

 The SPG will be an alert group, which can inform the school authorities and the police in case of any untoward happenings related to school children.
 
 "We have been getting complaints of inappropriate behaviour by school bus drivers, auto drivers getting too friendly apart from cases of kids being used for drug trade," said Kalamassery CI S Jayakrishnan.
 
 He said though schools were asked to form such groups, it has not happened. "The committee will have the school principal,   member, SI of the local police station, a local auto driver and any other member of the public who are part of the school neighbourhood. The group will keep track of any events, usual and unusual, which can be looked into and addressed before it becomes a big issue," Jayakrishnan added.
 
 A meeting of principals and other staff from Kalamassery, Thrikkakara and   was held on Wednesday to brief the schools on precautions to be taken with regard to school buses and traffic management during school time. "A group of people identified by the school, including PTA members, can be chosen to help manage the traffic during the peak hours. We are willing to train them on how to go about it," said Jayakrishnan.
 
 The schools have been asked to install CCTVs at least at the entrance and exit gates. Proper screening of school drivers should be done including getting police clearance and ensuring that they have 10 years of driving experience.
