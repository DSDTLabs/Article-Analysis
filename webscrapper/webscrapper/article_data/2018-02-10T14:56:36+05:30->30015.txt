MYSURU: Recalling the contribution of former chief minister D  , chairman of   (MPVL) HA Venkatesh said, “During his tenure, many policies were undertaken for the welfare of the backward classes. The 1970s was the era of the  ,” Venkatesh said.

 The MPVL chairman, who was at a state-level seminar on ‘Leadership and Movements of Backward Classes in Karnataka’ organised by the department of public administration of University of Mysore at   on Friday, remembered how Urs had extended reservation benefits to backward classes so that they could further their prospects through education and employment.
 
 “Members from the backward classes forayed into political activities as a result. He helped a civic worker contest elections in Bengaluru, thus helping individuals from underprivileged communities become MLAs and ministers,” said Venkatesh.
 
 He also lauded CM Siddaramaiah for undertaking the initiative of conducting a caste-based census in the state. “The caste census is being conducted to assess the socio-economic status of the backward communities across the state,” said Venkatesh.
 
 Pointing to the disparity in representation of women in political offices, he said, “Equality will be established only when women get opportunities in political activities. While there only eight women holding ministerial posts at the Centre, there are only two in the state government. Reservation must be extended to women in the Parliament.”
 
 The response to the seminar from the students was, unfortunately, lukewarm with just 30 of them participating.
 
 Director of UPE, University of Mysore, Hemanth Kumar, Professor Dayanand Mane were present.
