LUCKNOW: The   has constituted   and government officials to prepare an action plan for nearly a dozen sectors including agriculture and power, said chief secretary Rajiv Kumar.

 Kumar told TOI that the government will also interact with a delegation of  , visiting the state on July 22, on the action plan. He said that the groups of experts for key sectors have been set   in consultation with Niti Ayog, which is acting with the state government for pushing the development agenda.
 
 A vision document in consultation with the Niti Ayog has also been prepared detailing on the strategy for key sectors, Kumar said.
 
 Kumar said that agriculture was on top priority for chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi and the loan waiver scheme for small and marginal farmers was just one step, rather a short term measure, while the focus would be on ending farm distress and engaging people dependant on agriculture in allied sectors including horticulture and dairy, which are more lucrative. 
 
 The chief secretary said that the Niti Ayog, in its first interaction with the government recently, had identified some challenging areas including agriculture, power, roads, irrigation, health and education which required both a long term plan and short term measures. He said that this is first time when not only senior government officials, but experts from different fields have also been inducted in the team.
 
 Kumar said that GST is going to be a major turning point and would boost state coffers, apart from excise and stamp and registration. Moreover, while e-tendering initiated by the CM would make the system more transparent, the new process of work allotment would also increase the treasuries of the state and to a large extent check corruption, he said.
