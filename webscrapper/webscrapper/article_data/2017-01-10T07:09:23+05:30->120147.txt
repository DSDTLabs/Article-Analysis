 "This time over 35,000 persons participated in the programme at Nizam's College ground. On Sunday, there was a huge turnout of the devout for Prakash Utsav at Keyes High School in Secunderabad. Not only Sikhs but people of different faiths participated on the occasion," said S Baldev Singh Bagga, president of Prabhandak Committee Gurudwara Saheb, Secunderabad.
 
 The concluding event was organised by the Prabhandak Committee, Gurudwara Saheb, Secunderabad, as well as Gurudwara Guru Singh Sabha, Hyderabad, and Sikh Gurudwaras of Telanagana. More than 30,000 Sikh devotees and people of other faiths participated.
 
 For the first time, all the management committees of Gurudwaras in Telangana took out a joint procession carrying Guru Granth Sahib in the districts. "Yes, there has been a tremendous turnout for the birth anniversary celebrations as well as the state-wide procession tour that was organised. There is no doubt that more people are participating in the celebrations which is a good sign," said Sikh religious leader S Avatar Singh.
