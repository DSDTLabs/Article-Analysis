MUMBAI: The bandh slowed down   across the city on Wednesday, though most hospitals claimed it didn’t cripple things altogether. Outpatient departments of both public and private hospitals witnessed a near 60-70% dip in footfall as only patients in need of emergency care ventured out.

  
  At Parel’s KEM Hospital,the OPD numbers had fallen to less than half till 4pm. Dean Dr Avinash Supe said 3,000 patients came to the OPD as compared to the usual 8,000. “Surgeries were not affected much as majority of doctors and staffers in the morning shift reported to work,” he said, adding that over 100 operations were done. At most hospitals, things slowed down in the afternoon as people couldn’t arrive. At Sion Hospital, merely 64 admissions were reported between 7am and 3pm and three deliveries. Patients who came for OPD consultation had dipped to less than 1,000 compared to the usual 5,000-6,000. Situation was similar at BYL Nair Hospital, where OPDs saw a crowd of less than 400. Dean Dr   said that they still managed to carry out 70 major and minor surgeries and four deliveries.
 
 At the Rajawadi Hospital, Ghatkopar, the patient attendance was affected perhaps due to its proximity to areas like   and Chembur, that has been witnessing protests since Tuesday. Medical superintendent Dr   said only a third of 3,000 patients that come to OPDs daily came on Wednesday.
 
 She added that they carried out eight deliveries, including three C-sections, despite 40% of the staff strength not reporting to work. Only 900-odd patients had come to the OPD of Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care in Jogeshwari as against their usual numbers of 1,200-1,400. A doctor said an injured protester was among the patients who were treated. Patients that TOI spoke to said they didn’t have any problem in reaching hospitals though arranging ambulances took some time. Many hospital staffers were also ferried using ambulances.
