CHENNAI: Inspired by  , who overcame apparently insurmountable challenges to become the country’s first   police sub-inspector last year, 27 other members of the community on Sunday took this year’s police recruitment examination.

 M  , 24, of Kannagi Nagar, is among the 27 aspirants.
 
 Durga Shree’s parents, Munusamy and Kala of Tiruvannamalai, had named her Karthik. They moved the family to Kannagi Nagar, Chennai, when Karthik was in Class V — the time he started to feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body.
 
 She waited for five years to speak to her parents about her dilemma; when she did, they could not face the fact that their ‘son’ was of a different gender than they believed.
 
 “My parents said my behaviour would affect my sisters and society would shun me,” Durga Shree said. “I moved out after Class XII and took a rented room in the same locality but far from my family’s house.”
 
 She made a futile attempt to join the TN Police Youth Brigade two years ago. But Durga Shree has made up her made up her mind: She will fulfil her father’s wish — albeit not in the way he conceived of it — and will not return home till she is wearing the uniform of a police officer.
