NEW DELHI: With the draw of lots completed for   quota admissions in private schools in city, parents are set to make a beeline for the allotted schools. They are to submit   and confirm admission by  . The schools have been directed to give students their books, uniform and writing material by April 1 at the most.

 As per the guidelines for admission released by the directorate of education on Friday, no child can be rejected by the allotted school for being too far away from the school. The schools will also have to hold introductory sessions for all parents before the session begins. In case of rejections, schools have been told to clearly state the reason on the DoE online portal.
 
 The DoE has also taken a strict stand this year over rejection of candidates for unauthentic documents, after several complaints were received last year that schools had been sending children away claiming their documents are fake. The schools have been explicitly told that any cases related to authenticity of documents must be referred to the district headquarters of the deputy director of education for the respective district.
 
 The schools allotted cannot be changed. The parents must go to the schools with a printout of the application, two passport size photographs, self-attested documents â€” proof of birth date, residence proof, EWS/ DG category. There is no need to get documents attested by a gazetted officer. Schools cannot ask parents of DG category to produce an income certificate, and for EWS parents, an income certificate is needed.
