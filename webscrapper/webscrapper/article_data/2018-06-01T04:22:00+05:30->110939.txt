Vadodara: An assistant engineer of Shinor taluka panchayat was nabbed by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) for accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 on Wednesday night from a labour contractor to award valuation and completion certificate.

 Accused Nainesh Shah had demanded a bribe of Rs 50,000 around a month ago to award a valuation and completion certificate to the complainant. The complainant had laid paver blocks and street lights in some villages coming under Shinor taluka panchayat. ACB sleuths said that the two certificates were important for the contractor since that would have cleared his bill payments.
 
 The complainant gave him Rs 50,000, but Shah did not award him the certificates. He demanded another Rs 50,000, but since the contractor did not want to pay the bribe, he informed ACB about it. As per the trap plan, the complainant and Shah decided to meet near the latterâ€™s house at Parivar crossroads on Waghodiya Road.
 
 As Shah accepted the powdered currency notes, ACB sleuths reached there and arrested him. On Thursday, he was produced before a local court which sent him to police custody for three days.
 
 Officials said that Shah had been into government job since 30 years.
