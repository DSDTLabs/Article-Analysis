KOCHI: At  , where 100 artists come together for a   event for three days, the air is festive with a marquee and festoons.
The collateral venue of the Kochi Muziris Biennale-2016 is a hurly-burly of activities as the exhibits keep altering every hour of the day. Paintings, sculptures, installations as well as performances done as part of the three-day event which began on Thursday are interlaced in a 45 minute slot.
 
 “The idea of art marathon has its roots in a protest artists held in Bengaluru last year against the government when a MOU for giving away a public art gallery to a private agency was about to signed. A group titled Venkattappa Art Gallery Forum was formed and we were looking for ideas to engage more number of artists in a small event. The idea that birthed as a protest form is now put on a dis play here as an art experience,“ said  , the curator of Kala Samuha.
 
 The event is the first chapter of investment banker-turned art patron  's organization -Remani Nambiar Foundation -instituted in fond remembrance of her mother, an artist herself. The foundation is supporting the event.
 
 “Five artists, five slots, three days ­ this is the gist of Kala Samuha. The concept is to provide an impartial platform for the senior artists as well as the first timers together. It will also be a new experience for the audience as well, as within 45 minutes the exhibits are changed and they get to see something new every hour in the same venue,“ Lakshmi said.
