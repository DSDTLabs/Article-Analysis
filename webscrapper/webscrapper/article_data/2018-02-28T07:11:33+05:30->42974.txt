ALLAHABAD: Fans and supporters of Prime Minister   have once again devised a novel way of attracting the attention of voters in view of   byelection by circulating   on social media, including popular messaging apps.

 The chalisa, a collection of verses, showers praise on the prime minister for the work he has done for the country. It initially surfaced on social media last year when a group of dedicated fans of the prime minister circulated it on the occasion of his birthday.
 
 The   plays around 1:54 minutes. “Jai Narendra Gyan Gun sagar, Jai   Tihu Lok Ujagar, Rastra Doot Aatulit Baldhama, Damodar Putra Narendra Nama (The fame of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is spread everywhere and he has himself proved to be the real son of the country. Son of Damodar, your personality is being praised everywhere),” reads a verse.
 
 
 It had first appeared on social media in September 2016 in relation with Modi’s birthday. A group of his fans has circulated it again in February this year in view of Phulpur by-election to be held on March 11. Senior BJP leaders said they have no idea who was circulating the Chalisa, but claimed that popularity of the prime minister has increased manifold across the country and people are appreciating his decisions being taken for the betterment of the country. “There is no harm if the chalisa helps in promoting BJP prospects in the bypoll,” they said.
