Margao: Quepem police on Tuesday booked an offence against Sunil Kumar and Ankit Kumar, both directors of Sanatan Finance and Real Estates Pvt Ltd, and two Russians, Natalia and Itena, on charges of duping a   woman of Rs 45 lakh. 

 Police sources said Dmitroy Supyunguk, in her complaint, stated that she had booked a flat in Peace Valley, Shirvoi, Quepem, with Celsia Holiday Homes Pvt Ltd in Russia, in 2010. 
 
 She said the firm was operated by Natalia and Itena in Russia on behalf of Sunil and Ankit. 
 
 The complainant, police sources informed, had signed a sale deed with Celsia Holiday Homes in the same year and had made payments amounting to over Rs 45 lakh from 2010 to date. 
 
 The accused, however, failed to provide her the flat as agreed to in the sale deed. 
 
 Acting on the complaint, Quepem police booked an offence against the accused under Section 420 (cheating) read with Section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. 
 
 This is the second case of cheating booked by the Quepem police against Ankit. In an earlier matter, another Russian woman, Ilena Matvyankow, had complained that she was promised a 160 sqm villa in Peace Valley, Shirvoi for Rs 1.48 crore. 
 
 While she had paid the sum to Sanatan Finance and Real Estate, Ankit repeatedly failed to provide her the promised villa, Matvyankow had stated in her complaint.
 
  A case was registered against Ankit, who was later granted anticipatory bail.
