 Sources said Sonia had objected to Sunita and Satyawan's relationship, which lasted till January this year. Police officials said preliminary investigations revealed that Satyawan had married Alka, chosen by his mother, in January. Ever since, Sunita was her sworn enemy and came to   village on Saturday, looking for Saroj and Satyawan. She was accompanied by two other women, probably her relatives. Sources said, they found Saroj in her shop and set her on fire after dousing her with some inflammable liquid. Alka tried to save her, but failed to do so. Meanwhile, villagers rushed to the spot and nabbed Sunita while she was trying to escape from the spot.
