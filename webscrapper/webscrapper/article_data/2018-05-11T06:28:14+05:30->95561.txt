GANDHINAGAR: The   government may demand an allocation of Rs 2.5 lakh crore from the Centre under the 15th Finance Commission. This will be around 80% more than the fund allocated to the state by the  . 

 According to a senior IAS officer, the process to prepare the draft of demands to be submitted before the 15th Finance Commission (2020-2025) has already been initiated. “The reason for seeking more fund from the Centre is that Gujarat has a good record in utilization of central allocations. High performing states like Gujarat must not be at disadvantage. In 13th Finance Commission, the state got Rs 53,790 crore and in the current 14th Finance Commission, we got a commitment of Rs 1,39,725 crore. We expect an allocation of more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore this time,” he said.
 
 An all-member delegation of the finance panel is expected to visit Gujarat in June-end or July first week. All government departments have been asked to submit their five-year work projections and fund requirement. “We had requested the 14th Finance Commission also to give more funds to Gujarat because of its population, performance, and ability to carry out development works. Currently, we have been getting only 3% of the central allocation of funds which is not in sync with our population that is 5% of the total population of the country,” said the officer.
 
 
 
 Even after spending crores on consultant fees and engaging several government departments, the state government is yet to declare its much-hyped Vision 2030 document. The documents, prepared by the   (GIDB) and the  , is yet to see the light of the day even after three years. According to some senior government officials, the government should have published the Vision 2030 papers as the draft of demands to be submitted before the 15th Finance Commission is being prepared.
