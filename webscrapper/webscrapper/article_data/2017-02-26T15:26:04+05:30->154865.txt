COIMBATORE:   working president M K   on Sunday alleged that rebel   leader O   (OPS) was using late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s name for gaining political mileage.

 Hitting back at Panneerselvam for criticising his demand that Jayalalithaa’s name be removed from government schemes, Stalin said OPS had never raised doubts about the mystery behind the death of   when he was in power.
 
 “Only after he was denied the chief minister’s chair, which was two months after her death, did Panneerselvam choose to go on meditation in media limelight and say there was mystery in Jayalalithaa’s death,’’ Stalin said in a statement. 
 
 “What were the initiatives he took to probe the facts behind the death when he was the chief minister,’’ Stalin asked.
 
 He said the DMK was only reiterating law by insisting on the removal of Jayalalithaa’s portrait in government offices and her name in welfare schemes after the apex court upheld her conviction in assets case.
