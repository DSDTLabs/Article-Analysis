BHAGALPUR: The   on Saturday ordered snapping of the internet services in the district so as to prevent rumour mongering after communal clashes marred normal life in Muslim-dominated Nathnagar locality.

 The trouble began when a ‘Vikram Samvat’ procession, taken out on Saturday afternoon to spread awareness about the historical Hindu calendar system, made a brief halt near Medni Chowk. 
 
 This was opposed by a section of locals. Heated exchange of words soon gave way to clashes. The situation worsened as some miscreants torched a two-wheeler and vandalized shops in the area. 
 
 Police had to fire several rounds to quell the rampaging mob. Four constables and two ASIs were hurt in the brickbatting by the warring groups.
 
 Unconfirmed reports said crude bombs and petrol bombs were also hurled even as social workers tried to broker peace between the warring groups.
 
 Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar and DM Adesh Titarmare were camping at the spot. None of them could be reached for their version.
