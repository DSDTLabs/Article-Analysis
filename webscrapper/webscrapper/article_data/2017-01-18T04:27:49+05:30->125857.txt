New Delhi: Delhi civic elections have long been a straight fight between   and Congress. Now, with AAP in the mix and delimitation queering the pitch, things have turned interesting. BJP, which currently holds the reins of all three civic bodies, faces the dual challenge of combating anti-incumbency and winning over new voters. The party has 142 sitting councillors.

 Vijender Gupta, leader of opposition, said, “We (BJP) see no disadvantage in the new delimitation order. Peripheral areas where the wards have been increased are, in no way, a setback for us. In fact, as most existing wards in those areas are with BJP councillors, we can actually strengthen our presence.” Gupta, however, admitted that BJP would need to “reorganise the party structure as the grassroots level. The composition of the mandals will change, as several booths will either be added or removed from the existing ones due to delimitation. We have 279 mandals. Also, we will have to ask councillors to start work in new areas". 
 
 Congress, too, is seeing positives in the delimitation exercise, which it feels, will help the party reach out to traditional strongholds of unauthorised colonies and slums.   president Ajay Maken said: “Now that delimitation has happened, we hope that reservation for women and SC candidates is also finalised so that we can start planning.” He said the “non-performance” of BJP in the corporation and AAP’s Delhi government would be key issues that Congress planned to raise.
 
 AAP’s Delhi convener Dilip Pandey said he would study the final order in detail to understand the dynamics. “I don’t see Congress as a competition even now. As far as BJP goes, people are very unhappy with its performance at the civic level,” he said.
