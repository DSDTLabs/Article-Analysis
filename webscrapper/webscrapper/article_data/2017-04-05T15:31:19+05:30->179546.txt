 Commenting on the movie-to-book adaptation, author Anand Neelakantan said, “Long before Baahubali, there was Sivagami. So even though the film is on Baahubali, but the backstory could not be any other hero other than Sivagami…the story is her journey that these three books will be dealing with. Another strong character is Kattappa; he gives colour to the book and is a very modern character.” 
 
  “What we managed to showcase in the movie was just the tip of the iceberg,” said director Rajamouli. “From the minute I started working on this story, I knew the world of Baahubali can’t be encompassed into a film or two, simply because there’s so much more to tell. Books give the epic tale a new life and we’re thrilled to be collaborating with Westland to bring this book to the audiences.” 
 
  When Neelakantan was asked if he had any other major project in line, he said that he has signed a contract of 10 books with   and is also writing television scripts for upcoming epic series. The director has also in mind to adapt the Sivagami trilogy to a season-based TV series.
