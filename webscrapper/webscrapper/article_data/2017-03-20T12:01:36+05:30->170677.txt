Power Star   has a special liking for Tamil actor   as the duo shares many similarities. During his London tour last year, Pawan told his fans that he wants to act alongside Ajith and is waiting for the right script.

 The buzz is that the stage is all set for Pawan’s long-awaited debut in Tamil, as Tamil producers want to optimise the star’s growing popularity among film buffs in Tamil Nadu.
 
 The actor has already launched ‘Katamarayudu’, which is a remake of Ajith’s blockbuster flick ‘Veeram’ and is busy with the Telugu remake of Ajith’s ‘Vedalam.’
