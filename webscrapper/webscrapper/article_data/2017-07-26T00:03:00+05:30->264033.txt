CHENNAI: In a victory for  , the   on Tuesday removed the interim stay on the construction of the association’s building at T Nagar. The high court on May 6 had imposed a stay on the construction.

 Vacating the order, the division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and V Parthiban said they would pass detailed order on the petition shortly.
 
 The issue pertains to a plea moved by K M Srirangan and R Annamalai, both residents of   colony T Nagar the area in which the association wanted to construct a building. The petitioners submitted that the colony has two approach roads to reach Habibullah Eoad. One is through the Kodambakkam High Road and another the 33 Feet Road connecting   and Prakasam Street. The second one being the shortest, most of the residents and school-going children use it to reach the colony.
 
 “But now residents of the colony and public are prevented from using the road by the Nadigar Sangam Charitable Trust and South Indian Artistes Association (SIAA) since they have blocked the road for constructing a building for the association. They have no rights to block and encroach a public road. Since the members of the association have influence over government authorities, they managed to get patta for the encroachment in 2010 suppressing material facts,” the petitioners said.
 
 They added that the colony being a residential area, the association cannot be allowed to construct a multistoried mall or multiplex, which would suffocate the already chocked roads.
 
 Subsequently, the court appointed an advocate commissioner to measure the property of Nadigar Sangam with the assistance of government authorities and submit a report. After the perusing the report of the commissioner and other documents produced by the association, the court noted that petitioners had not made out a prima facie case and vacated the stay.
