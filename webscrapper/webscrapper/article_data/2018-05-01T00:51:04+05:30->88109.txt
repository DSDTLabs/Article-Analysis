   scored a brace in the last six minutes to help   SC to a 2-1 win over Dempo SC at the GMC Athletic Stadium in   on Monday and seal a berth in the semifinals of the   where they take on Guardian Angel.
 
  The former junior international had scored a hat-trick just three days ago in the 6-0 rout of SRPF, Maharashtra. But things were looking bad for Goa’s only I-League representative when they trailed until the 84th minute to a first-half strike by Beevan D’Mello.
  
  However, some inspirational words from team owner Churchill Alemao kept them going in the second half and Uttam converted a delightful freekick that gave Dempo goalkeeper Tyson Caiado no chance with six minutes to go.
  
  In the final minute, Churchill burst into attack and Nigerian Francis Onyeama did well to set up Uttam in the box. However, it was the skill of the 21-year-old that left the rival defenders wanting as he turned and twisted to calmly slot home the winner.
  
  Most recently, the teams played an entertaining 3-3 draw in the Goa Pro League and they went head-to-head in the opening minutes. Francis should have given Churchill an early lead but shot straight into the gloves of Tyson. At the other end, Dempo were gaining momentum with Kapil Hoble sending dangerous low crosses to Yogesh Kadam but the striker lacked finishing.
  
  It was the individual brilliance of Beevan that separated the team in the first half. The forward found himself in an ideal position outside the 18-yard box and unleashed a powerful grounder past James Kithan in the 37th minute.
  
  Churchill were unlucky before the break when Francis saw his fierce shot hit the upright.
