Coimbatore: The proposed vector-borne disease centre of the National Institute of Malaria Research (Nimr) is likely to come up at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (Cmch). A member of the Indian Council of Medical Research (Icmr), who was in the city to survey health facilities here, preferred   because of the presence of three major laboratories in the campus and availability of space, sources said.

 Nimr, a research wing of the Icmr, had written to Coimbatore Medical College authorities in July stating that they were planning to set up a Centre of Excellence in Climate Change and Vector-Borne Disease in Coimbatore, because of the lack of such a centre in the region.
 
 A member from Icmr inspected the college campus, hospital and the joint director of medical services’ building on Race Course, said Cmch dean B Ashokan. “Of the three, Cmch was preferred for setting up of the research centre. Icmr wanted around 300 sq ft of space, which was easily available in the hospital because of the new buildings,” he said.
 
 “The place has three major laboratories adjoining it — biochemistry, microbiology and pathology labs, which convinced the person further,” said the dean. “Moreover, we have allotted almost all the space and buildings to various functions in our presentation to the Medical Council of India, where we have asked for a raise in intake of MBBS students,” said Ashokan.
 
 The research station will focus on the breeding pattern and population of culex, anopheles and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the region and the virus they spread. “Icmr is also looking at various facilities in Kerala for the centre,” said the dean.
 
 “The laboratory facilities will completely be set up by Nimr, which will also appoint researchers and other staff. It will benefit the public health domain,” Ashokan added.
