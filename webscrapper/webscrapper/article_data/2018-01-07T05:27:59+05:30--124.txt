  While the police brass remained alert, ‘Mission Mahavrat’ failed to make any impact on Saturday. Senior officers of Police Headquarters kept an eye on each development with the thrust being on food being served to constables in different police stations, police messes and police lines. Later in the day, additional director-general (law and order)   announced that National Security Act would be invoked against any “outsider” who was found guilty of provoking policemen to observe token fast.
 
  According to sources, constables were demanding a pay scale at par with employees from other departments, more leaves, allowances, relaxation from   duties and reservation for their children in the Army. In favour of their demands, a call had been given to observe mass fast on Saturday.
  
  ADG Kumar told TOI, “The issue has been blown out of proportion and it appears to be an act of mischief by some people, who we are trying to identify at the earliest. As it was an attempt of disturbing public order and creating hindrance to official work, we will slap   against any outsider who is found provoking the police force.”
 
  This is not the first time that such a matter has come to the fore. Around two years ago, a protest had been called against alleged discrepancies in the pay structure of the constables. However, the movement had subsided without making much of an impact.
