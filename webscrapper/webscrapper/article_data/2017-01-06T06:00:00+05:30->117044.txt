Visakhapatnam: An Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) centre was inaugurated at INHS Kalyani by Reena Lanba, president of Naval Wives Welfare Association (NWWA), on Thursday.

 The naval hospital will now be equipped with Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI) facility and facilitate couples in service who face infertility issues.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Reena Lanba said the centre will fulfil the dream of parenthood of the childless couples. The facility is expected to benefit infertile couples who earlier had to be sent to other centres for treatment causing psychological and monetary stress.
 
 Surgeon Cmde Rahul Ray, commanding officer, INHS Kalyani in his welcome address said this centre is a foundation on which an In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) centre of the future Command Hospital will be established. TNN
