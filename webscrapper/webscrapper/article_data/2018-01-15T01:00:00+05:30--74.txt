When director duo, Pradeep Rangwani and  , decided to make  , the only actor they had in mind for the role of the   was  , although he has played a police officer in his previous films. “This time, Arbaaz plays a Maharashtiran cop, Inspector Lokhande, who is honest and who follows the rule book.

It took the filmmakers three weeks to finalise the actor’s look for the film that also features  ,   and  . In the interim, the actor also improved his Marathi accent among other traits to play his part convincingly. The   features several instances where Arbaaz is seen mouthing lines and phrases in Marathi. Pradeep admits that the actor was nervous at the outset but eventually, slipped well into the character.
 Pradeep adds, “You have to see the film to see how Arbaaz has played the part, replete with the right body language and mannerisms. He was apprehensive about playing this part but he came around. He also guided us whenever we felt we were stuck.”
 Interestingly, even though Arbaaz’s character is investigating a murder, he’s also one of the suspects. Talking about the dichotomy, Pradeep says, “The tagline of our film is ‘India’s First   Thriller’. The screenplay is such that everyone seems like a suspect because at some point, they all have some connection with the one who is murdered. Even cop Lokhande is not spared.”
 'Nirdosh', produced by UV Films, releases January 19.
