DIGHA: It’s been three weeks since trawlers ventured out into the Bay of   from Digha, but fishermen are dismayed with the   catch. “Only 5% of last year’s catch has been met in these three weeks,” said a fisherman. Consequently, prices have soared with 200-300gm hilsas selling at Rs 400-450/kg at the   wholesale fish market, the largest in the state. 

 The slightly larger 400-600gm fish are going for Rs 750-800/kg. Those in the trade said retail prices in   were at least Rs 200/kg higher than at Digha and city retail prices were averaging at Rs 1,000-1,200/kg.
 
 Wholesalers said only 20-25 tonne of hilsa has been caught since the trawlers went out to sea on June 14. Earlier, trawlers made a daily catch of 25-30 tonne during the three- to four-month fishing season from mid-June. 
 
 In fact, the largest catch is during June and July. During these four months following the breeding season, hilsa swim from the deep sea towards sweet water closer to the coastline. Fishermen have to take their trawlers about 20-22 nautical miles from the coast. 
 
 Fish traders cite two reasons for the low catch. The ideal weather needed for a good catch is a strong easterly wind and scattered rainfall. “Instead, we have witnessed cloudy weather for days together,” said a trader. Another key reason, they said, was the practice of bottom trawling where fishermen tie heavy metallic objects to their nets. “This tends to disturb the natural biological conditions under water, leading to food shortage for marine life. This hinders natural growth of hilsa. Hence, the small size of the fish caught this year,” said Debashis Shyamal of the National Fish Workers’ Forum.
 
 Shyam Sundar Das of the Digha Sankarpur Fish Traders’ Association said, “Some 1,000 trawlers have ventured out to sea since the fishing season began on June 14. The hilsa output is dismally low so far. It can only increase if the weat-her improves.”
