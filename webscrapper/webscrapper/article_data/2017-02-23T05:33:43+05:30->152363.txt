BHARUCH/SURAT: It's official. The desperately needed third bridge over   near   will be opened for public by Prime Minister   on March 7.

Top sources in the district collectorate told TOI that they have received a verbal confirmation from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) that Modi would be opening the bridge on March 7.
 
 S P Sharma, project director, NHAI said, “More trial runs will be conducted on the bridge over the next few days and the approach roads are expected to be ready in 8-10 days. The work on toll plaza and a flyover near   towards   is expected to be completed in two months.“
