BENGALURU/TUMAKURU: Among his many followers,   seer   counts PM   as one. Modi made a surprise phone call to the mutt's junior seer, Siddalinga Swami, on Sunday to enquire about the pontiff's health. 

 The seer was admitted to   in Bengaluru on May 12, after he was suspected to be suffering from urinary infection, coupled with problems in the lungs and liver. However, the doctors found that a previously placed stent in the bile duct was causing an obstruction. The seer was discharged after the obstruction was removed.
 
  In a conversation that lasted two minutes at 5.10pm on Sunday, the PM enquired about the condition of Shivakumara Swami. 
 
  Staff at the mutt said Modi wanted to know why the pontiff had been admitted to the Bengaluru hospital, and the treatment he had undergone. Modi reportedly assured Siddalinga Swami that he would visit the Tumakuru mutt shortly. 
 
 Modi had called on the seer in September 2014. "Hon'ble PM enquired about swamiji's health & wished speedy normalcy (sic)" BJP general secretary (organization) B L Santhosh tweeted on Sunday.
