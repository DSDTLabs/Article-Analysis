'  3' is making news and while everyone felt that   and   would be a part of this film. But now we hear it’s   who has been signed on for the third part of this hit franchise. 

 A source close to the production house confirmed, “There is a huge fanbase for Alia and Varun. Their fans even call them   or Valia. All their films have been hits. It’s only obvious for Vishesh Films to confirm this hit pairing for the third film in the series. Music will again play a key role in the film because what’s 'Aashiqui' without music.” We can already hear Varun and Alia fans squealing with joy. Trust us we are equally excited about this film! On the same, filmmaker   had earlier commented, “It’s a loved franchise but it should come back for the right reason, which is the script. I would’ve made ‘Aashiqui 2’ even if it would’ve been called ‘RJ ki ek love story’. I wanted to make the film badly and tell the story. You shouldn’t make a film because you want to capitalise on a title. You can get the film to the audience but you can’t make them like it. I can lose everything I built with ‘Aashiqui 2’ by making a bad Aashiqui 3.”
