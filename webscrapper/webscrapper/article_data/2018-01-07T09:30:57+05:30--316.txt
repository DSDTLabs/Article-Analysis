GUWAHATI: One good match may not be adequate for a turnaround. But NorthEast United did turn things around a little by clinching their first victory of the season at home. It came as a delight for the supporters at   Athletic Stadium and a relief for the franchise that is trailing in the second-last spot on the   table.

 Above all, the 2-1 victory against the in-form   came as a boost to the morale of the team that, on Saturday, played its first match since the arrival of former Chelsea manager  . The win did not improve the northeast team's position on the table - with seven points from eight matches - while the loss caused their opponents from Goa to occupy the fifth spot with 13 points from their eight games.
 
 It was Brazilian Marcinho who opened the scoring in the 21st minute only for Goa's   to find the equalizer just six minutes later. But to the excitement of NEUFC fans, the all-important winner came in the 52nd minute from the foot of northeast and Manipur footballer Seiminlen Doungel.
 
 Grant made three changes to the NEUFC lineup by bringing in defender Nirmal Chetri in place of   while Doungel and Halicharan Narzary featured on the wings replacing Malemngamba Meitei and Lalrindika Ralte respectively.
 
 Sergio Lobera, on the other hand, made four changes with Sergio Juste, Chinglensana Singh, Pronay Halder and Manuel Arana coming in in place of Edu Bedia, Bruno Pinheiro, Mohamed Ali and Narayan Das.
 
 Goa goalkeeper Kattimani found himself tested in the sixth minute when Marcinho's through-ball from the right found Danilo only for the goalie to parry it away.
