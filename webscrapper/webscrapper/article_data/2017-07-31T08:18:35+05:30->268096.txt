BATHINDA: The   government would come up with an agriculture policy soon to ensure the welfare of farming community, said Punjab finance minister  . 

 "We will not restrict waiving the debt of small and marginal farmers up to Rs 2 lakh, but will go beyond that to support farmers in many ways through a new agriculture policy. Only waiving debt is not the complete solution," he told TOI.
 
 However, he did not give a timeframe for implementing the policy.
 
 Badal said previous governments had been paying lip service to farmers, but no-one had ever thought of coming up with a welfare policy. "Now, the Captain   government has decided to adopt a multi-pronged approach for the welfare of farmers; we will soon come up with an agriculture policy," he said.
 
 On July 26 and 27, he said, he will meet senior officials of RBI and   in Mumbai with to ask them to help the state government in waiving the loans of farmers. "The RBI accepted our plea for releasing data of accounts of farmers in various banks, provided the farmers request for it. Of the 10 lakh farmers who are eligible for loan waiver, 6 lakh have accounts in cooperative banks and 4 lakh in commercial nationalised banks," he said. "We also requested the RBI to allow waiving interest under one-time settlement in accounts which have gone delinquent. This happens due to unethical lending at higher interest rates. The government is committed to waiving nearly Rs 9,500 crore debt of 10 lakh farmers," he said. 
 
 On the question of abolishing the extension of two years in service to government employees at retirement, Manpreet said though this government was, in principle, in favour of keeping retirement age at 58 years because 6 youths could be employed on superannuation of one employee at the same pay, the matter would be discussed at a cabinet meeting on August 4. "We will have to arrange money to give to those retiring, which is a problem for the government," he said.
