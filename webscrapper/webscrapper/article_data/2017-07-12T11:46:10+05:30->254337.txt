GANDHINAGAR: The   (GSPC) board on Tuesday cleared the deal by which the   will acquire 10% share of Geo-Global Resources (GGR) in GSPC’s KG Basin oil exploration project —at zero cost. Earlier, the   had accepted the Government of Gujarat’s proposal to allow the state-run GSPC to make the acquisition. 

 The GSPC has estimated a notional value of Rs 1,000 crore, promising to waive “call money’’ as set out in the agreement. It will also write off recoveries that were to be made from the GGR. The GSPC board, chaired by chief secretary   — also the chairman & managing director of the corporation — approved the deal on Tuesday.
 
  The Centre has also approved the final modalities of the ONGC’s proposal to take 80% share in the GSPC’s KG Basin operation for around Rs 8,000 crore. The modalities of this deal were also cleared by the GSPC board.
 
 “GGR had agreed to the proposal earlier,” Singh said. “Now we will inform the state government of the progress and will complete the formalities shortly. If we consider the ONGC-GSPC deal, the notional value of GGR’s share will be roughly around Rs 1,000 crore.’’
 
 On the status of the ONGC-GSPC deal, Singh said: “We are hopeful that the   between the two companies will be done by the end of July.”
 
 The GSPC’s decision not to make any recovery from GGR comes in the background of recovery of more than Rs 2,500 crore proposed by the Gujarat assembly’s Public Enterprise Committee (PEC) and the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG).
 
 Despite public criticism from PEC and CAG, the Gujarat government did not act against the company. The PEC accepted the CAG observation that the GSPC partnered with the controversial GGR with no risk to the latter. 
 
 The committee questioned how the GSPC could partner with GGR only in profit but not in loss. The committee asked whether the government knew about the faulty deal and recommended the cancellation of the contract model.
