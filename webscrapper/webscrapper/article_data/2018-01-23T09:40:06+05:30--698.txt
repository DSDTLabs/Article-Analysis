On a nippy Sunday morning, TOI lensman LR   let his shutter noise join the discordant mix of sounds made by flocks of birds on the National Institute of Ocean Technology’s ( ) campus bang on the   marshland in Chennai. His efforts have brought alive long-billed waterwading birds including pelicans, painted storks, spoonbills and cormorants on TOI pages.

 At least 5,000 birds have made the sprawling lake inside NIOT campus their home, and created an avian highway. While pelicans have already started hatching and the chicks have started sticking their beaks into their indulgent mother’s throat for feed, painted storks are busy knitting their nests with twigs and green leaves, and have started laying eggs. Spoonbills and cormorants are also too busy building homes to notice rare visitors, who sit quietly about 200 metres away recording this year’s mating and nesting season.
 
 “Number of chicks is more this year, which means the parent-birds think water and feed in the vicinity could support a larger family,” says Shankar, adding: “Birds decide their family size depending on water and feed availability.”
 
 Of all waterbodies hosting large birds, only at Pallikaranai can one get as close as 200 metres to the birds. NIOT has built a compound wall and left the waterspread as such to ensure that the birds are not disturbed by visitors.
