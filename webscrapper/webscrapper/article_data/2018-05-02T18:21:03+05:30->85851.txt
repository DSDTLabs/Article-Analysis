Sweta refused to get close to her co-actor   on screen, when a suhagraat scene was being planned. Informs a source from the set, “Sweta has a clause in her contract that she won’t do intimate scenes, and won’t wear sleeveless and short clothes. Because of this, the suhagraat sequence had to be toned down considerably.” 

 When contacted, the actress said that she has an issue wearing short and sleeveless clothes, but hasn’t mentioned it in her contract. She says, “I am not comfortable wearing sleeveless clothes, as I don't think that they flatter my body. When it comes to short clothes, I had told the producers right in the beginning that I won’t wear hot pants or anything too short. This is the remake of a Bengali show and we are sticking to the original script. There wasn’t any intimate scene in the original show, so there is no need to shoot one for the Hindi version. I had told the makers that I won’t be comfortable shooting intimate scenes or locking lips, which has become normal on TV nowadays. However, it’s not up my alley.”
