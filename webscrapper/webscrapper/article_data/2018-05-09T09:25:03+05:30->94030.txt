CHENNAI: The   of Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB), in charge of supplying water and removing sewage in the city, has met only   since January 2014. And not a single   was conducted after the AIADMK was re-elected to power in May 2016.

 This despite the mandate in the CMWSSB Act, 1978, that the board should meet at least once in every three months. The violation was revealed in a reply to an RTI filed by Chennai-based activist group Arappor Iyakkam. 
 
 The board is the decisionmaking authority pertaining to policies and sanction of projects like supply of water, desalination plants and sewage treatment plants. It comprises top IAS officials, including the MD of CMWSSB. Municipal administration minister S P Velumani is the chairman of the board and the MD is  , who is also the chief electoral officer. Despite repeated calls, both could not be reached for comment. 
 
 “Chennai has been facing lot of issues with respect to drinking water and sewage. There was a severe drought in 2017. More than 100MLD of untreated sewage is being let out into water bodies. It is hence shocking that the board has not met since 2016,” read a statement by Arappor.
 
 A source said all major decisions were being taken by circulating the agenda among the members. Dissent, if any, was taken into account by re-circulating the minutes, the source said, adding, “Decision-making is faster this way.” Retired IAS officer   said the government formed boards to give more autonomy and introduce corporate style of working as opposed to the slow moving government system. “But this shows that such boards are now working unprofessionally. The idea was to bring in external experts to increase efficiency,” he said.
