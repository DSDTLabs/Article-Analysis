NAVI MUMBAI: The   for the past three days has exposed the alleged   of asphalt refurbishment of the Thane-Belapur road, especially the one kilometer stretch of road from Turbhe Naka till the Turbhe flyover. The potholes have surfaced at several places which is causing inconvenience to the motorists who are suffering a bumpy ride. Due to the potholes, the motorists are compelled to slow down to dodge the potholes and the traffic snarl is evident. 

 However, the crux of the problem is the jurisdiction issue between the PWD and the NMMC as the stretch of 200 metres in the vicinity of the Turbhe flyover is full of huge potholes which are not been repaired. The reason been that the stretch is located at the intersection of the Thane-Belapur road and the Sion-Panvel highway. Hence, both the agencies are pointing fingers towards each other for filling the potholes. 
 
 “The subway is water-logged most of the time and it becomes difficult to drive. When it rains heavily the visibility is also reduced making the situation worse,” said Pramod Shelar, a motorist.
 
 Eventually, the snail pace movement of vehicles has been disrupting the traffic movement on the Thane-Belapur road as well as the Sion-Panvel highway. Eventually, the motorists suffer.
 
 While,throughout the day, the motorists are getting stuck in traffic snarls on the Sion-Panvel highway from Nerul flyover till Turbhe flyover for a distance of 5 kms, the same problem is been faced by motorists plying on the Thane-Belapur road while heading from Thane towards Turbhe.
