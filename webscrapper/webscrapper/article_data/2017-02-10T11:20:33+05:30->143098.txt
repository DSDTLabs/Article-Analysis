Sonakshi ruses Dev to the hospital. Ishwari and the rest reach the accident spot and panic after seeing blood on the floor.
 
  Sonakshi asks the doctor to start the treatment and she will inform the police. Bejoy and Asha also reach the spot. Bejoy tells Ishwari and family that the cab driver got them here as he told that Sona is helping an injured man.
  
  Sona calls Asha from hospital and tells them the hospital's name. Everybody rushes.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  Doctor comes out and tells that Dev is severely injured but out of danger because Sonakshi got him on time.
  
  Ishwari thanks Sona for saving her son. Sona and Dev talk to each other. She tells him that he saved her from the earthquake and she saved him from the goons. So the favour is balanced now.
  
  Ishwari enters Dev's room and tells him that she did not ask Sona to seperate from him. She herself walked out of his life.
  
  Sona reaches home and sees Suhana drawing a picture of his father.
  
  Daadi and Sourav return from their Europe trip. Sona then sees Dev's interview in the newspaper. Dev challenges the culprits who tried to defame his company. When the reporters asks Dev about his ex-wife Sonakshi, he replies saying he doesn't remember his past and wants to focus on his work.
