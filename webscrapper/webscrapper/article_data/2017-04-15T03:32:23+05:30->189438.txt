NAVI MUMBAI: The city traffic department’s deputy commissioner of police has proposed to close the road intersection on   which was being used by vehicles coming from   to reach Kille gaothan. This will avoid the   caused by the vehicles coming from Belapur village during the red signal at the   junction due to the vehicles moving towards Vashi and those plying along CBD lane as well. 

 DCP (Traffic) Nitin Pawar said, “Due to severe snarls at the road intersection near Belapur village and incidents of mishaps at the junction, on trial basis, we had closed the road intersection for a fortnight from March 21. It resolved the congestion problem as the vehicles exiting from Belapur village, some 50 metres from the Kille gaothan signal, had to take a left turn and then a U-turn near Diwale village and head towards Kille gaothan junction.” —George Mendonca
