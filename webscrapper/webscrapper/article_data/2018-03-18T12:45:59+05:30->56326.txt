AGARTALA:   Chief Minister   will meet Prime Minister   soon to seek a special package to tide over financial crisis in the state, a minister said on Saturday. 

 Deb will also meet   Minister Arun Jaitley with the same proposal, Transport Minister Pranajit   told reporters here.
 
 "The state's financial condition was reviewed in a meeting of the council of ministers yesterday. The state is reeling under deep financial crisis. The budget deficit in the current financial year is Rs 1,588.19 crore," he said.   department officials have been asked to put forward a comprehensive report on the state's fiscal condition in the next three days and after getting the report, the chief minister will leave for Delhi, he said.
 
 The state's revenue generation is poor while fiscal deficit is on the rise. The state's own revenue is currently able to manage only 12.94 per cent of its expenditure, he said.
 
 To a question, Singha Roy said agriculture, tourism and many other sectors needed immediate financial attention.
