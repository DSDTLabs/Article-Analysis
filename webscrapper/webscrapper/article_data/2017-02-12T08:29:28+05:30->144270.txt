PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Nearly five years after the work order was issued for   in Chinchwad, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation is yet to complete it.

 After missing at least 4 deadlines earlier, the civic body has now proposed to complete the flyover by April. Currently, girders are being constructed for the flyover on the Pune-Lonavla railway line. The construction of the flyover has been delayed by nearly three years.s
 
 The 1.9km long flyover on the 45 metre wide Kalewadi phata-Dehu Alandi Bus Rapid Transit System(BRTS) road, will be the longest flyover in the municipal limits. The completion of the flyover is expected to reduce traffic problems in Pimpri, Chinchwad and Kalewadi as it will enable vehicles to cross the Pavana river, Pune-Lonavala railway tracks,   and the Pune-Mumbai highway to go from Kalewadi to Autocluster in Chinchwad. 
 
 A large number of people, particulary IT professionals, will travel via the BRTS corridor to Wakad, Pimple Saudagar, and Hinjewadi.
 
 BRT cell spokesperson   told TOI, “Around 95% of the construction is complete. The work of laying the 14 girders on the railway tracks in Chinchwad is in progress and will be completed by February end.”
 
 Empire Estate residents are, however, not sure the flyover will be completed by April and have threatened to not pay property tax from the next financial year.
