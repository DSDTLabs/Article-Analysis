LUCKNOW: Solution to an issue in the House will have to be sought from within as there cannot be any alternative to the functioning of the Assembly in a democratic system, said  ,   on Friday. 

 Dixit said the records of the proceedings confirm that the Leader of the Opposition,  , spoke more in the House than the Leader of the House, CM Aditya Nath Yogi. He also said the total percentage of the Opposition is just 18% but the duration for which the Opposition members spoke in the House was more than 38%. 
 
 Dixit questioned the conduct of the Opposition members boycotting Assembly proceedings and holding a parallel, mock House and not attending the session even to mourn the death of a BJP MLA. 
 
  He said since he was a staunch believer in the principles of justice, he would give a chance to the members of the Opposition to explain their behavior and seek their reply before pronouncing any judgment and taking the matter to a logical conclusion.
 
 Earlier, addressing a press conference in Tandon Hall of the Assembly after the House was adjourned sine die on Thursday, the Speaker had clarified that the issue of the recovery of explosives from the Assembly hall was being investigated by the NIA and it would present its findings soon after the completion of the probe.
