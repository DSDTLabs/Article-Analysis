Coinciding with the ongoing four-day visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to India, Sikhs in France have red-flagged the issue of turban-less photos on all identity documents in France. They want the issue to be raised with the French president.

 Sikh representative France, Ranjit G   said, "Wearing a turban is part of Sikh identity, not any fashion. It is embarrassing to have identity cards without turban. It's also humiliating."
 
 
 Chain Singh, member of Gurdwara Singh Sabha France said," The core issue of Sikhs in France is the ID photo issue, we feel humiliated each time we have to show an ID card without our Dastaar on the picture. Macron is a new and young president, we expect that he will understand the importance of Dastaar during this visit."
 
 Sikhs in France have also released a global appeal to the Panth. "We appeal to the Panth to take the notice of situation of Sikhs in France. The Dastaar struggle is still on the table. Even after the success in  , the situation of Sikhs in France has not changed. Each time French Sikh wants to apply for any identity document, we are asked to remove our Dastaar for the picture. We need the support from entire Sikhs from world. What's happening in France can happen elsewhere in Europe."
 
 The Government regulation of 2006 regarding identity card photos without head cover is erasing the Sikh identity in the French society. It points out that the issue hasn't been resolved even after the then French president F Hollande's visit to New Delhi in 2016.
 
 Emphasisisng the historical link between Sikhs and France dating back to the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh empire, the appeal also refers to the Sikh soldiers who fought in the Great War.
 
 It points out that even a single bus card (Navigo Card) requires a picture without Dastaar. Sikhs cannot have a photograph with turban on all documents -- European licence, Identity card, student card or health card.
