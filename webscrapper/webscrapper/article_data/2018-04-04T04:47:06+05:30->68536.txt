NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Tuesday latched on to the Centre's U-turn on fake news order, saying Prime Minister   is "losing control" over his government.

 Shortly after the I&B ministry withdrew its order after a nudge by the PMO, Congress president   tweeted, "Sensing mounting anger on the 'fake news' notification, the PM orders a U-Turn on his own order. One can clearly see a loss of control and panic setting in now."
 
 Congress leader Anand Sharma said it was difficult to believe Modi was not aware of the order before it was issued, considering that all authority and decision-making in this government is centralised in him. Referring to BJP and RSS as "beneficiaries of fake news", Sharma also said they "know more about fake news than perhaps any leader in the world, than any government in the world". TMC chief Mamata Banerjee called it a "brazen and draconian" bid to curb press freedom and said it showed that the government "has lost its way".
 
 CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury condemned the government's "duplicitous" move and accused it of attacking the media. "We stand for, and are committed to, a free and independent Press," he tweeted.Congress leader and former Union I&B minister Manish Tewari said, "  had a method to it's madness. Intended targets were not those who were supposedly shot. Real targets were the MEDIA OWNERS. This was Looking London and Shooting Tokyo. Gold leaf from Text book of Fascism. A warning shot. This is but the beginning.(sic)"
