PUNE: The Pune police can now move to arrest developer   and his wife, Hemanti, in a   case, even as the couple’s   application is pending and is likely to be heard by the high   on March 7. 

 Till late Friday night, police said they did not know the whereabouts of Kulkarni and his wife. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Pankaj Dahane, who is holding an officiating charge of economic offences wing (EOW), said, “We are searching for the couple and their son, Shirish. We have formed four teams comprising crime branch and EOW officials to track them down.” 
 
 On February 9, special judge J T Utpat in Pune had rejected Shirish Kulkarni’s anticipatory bail application stating that it was for the investigating officer to decide after any inquiry to ascertain Shirish’s involvement in the case. The EOW had issued a summons to Shirish on January 24 for questioning. 
 
 DSK’s lawyer Manoj Mohite told TOI, “The main application for anticipatory bail is still pending. It has not been disposed of by the court. Only the interim protection has been vacated. Police are free to take action. For now, the options under the law are limited to either moving the Supreme Court against the high court’s order vacating the interim protection or wait till the main application is finally disposed of.”
 
 Jitendra Mulekar, the original complainant whose FIR opened a floodgate of complaints against DSK, said, “The police should arrest him immediately. Before me, some depositors had tried to lodge a complaint against him but he convinced them against approaching the police. I was intent on getting back my money considering that  's company did not return my deposit with interest totalling Rs 4.40 lakh. I lodged the complaint and I am happy that another 4,000-odd depositors followed suit. I am sure I will get my money only through the proceedings under the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act."
