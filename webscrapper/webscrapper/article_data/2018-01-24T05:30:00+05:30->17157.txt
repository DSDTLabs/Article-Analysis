Mysuru: After Chamaraja constituency’s   demanded   for   during the assembly session in Belagavi, the government has decided to sanction ten more ventilators for the institute. The new ventilators are expected to be installed in two months. As of now, the hospital has just 17 ventilators, much to the inconvenience of the patients.

 Paucity of ventilators often forced doctors to refer patients to private hospitals. However, doctors are likely to greet the news of the impending arrival of ten new ventilators to the hospital with a mixture of relief and delight. Doctors at the hospital pointed out that patients from the underprivileged sections particularly had it hard, since they found it very difficult to afford ventilators at private hospitals.
 
 In-charge superintendent of KR Hospital Dr Chandrashekar told TOI that nearly 1,500 to 1,800 patients visited the outpatient facility every day, besides around 500 of them who are here on a more regular basis. “Apart from this, at least 100 patients are housed here round the clock. Given the growing demand, we require at least 50 ventilators. MLA Vasu raised the issue of the hospital he saw the problem,” Dr Chandrashekar said, adding that the process to acquire ten new ventilators was in the tender stage already. “If we get 20 more, that would help us a great deal,” he said.
