PUNE: Irate landowners of Purandar taluka will be in Pune for a massive protest on Wednesday.

 The villagers have already sent 500 letters to the President of India. The landowners said they plan to turn out in plenty and march to the office of district collector   and stage a protest. 
 
 “Notices from tehsildar of Purandar have reached all seven villages. Though the notice does not have the signature of the tehsildar which is confusing us, it has said all landowners should come to the office and give information on which fruit, vegetable or grain is grown in addition to the details on the kind of fruit or vegetables by February 15. We have decided to concentrate on the protest march,”  , a landowner of   village, told TOI.
 
 “No one from the administration is talking to us. They are doing what they will by sending notices. Purandar MLA Vijay Shivtare knows that his vote bank will not be affected by our seven villages. However, it is our fight and we are going to fight hard. We will not harm people of the administration if they talk to us. They should also know why we don’t want to part with our plots,” a landowner said.
 
 At a gram sabha last week in Pargaon, the villagers decided to send individual letters to the President seeking his permission to die if their lands were taken. The seven affected villages include Pargaon, Kunbharvan, Vanpuri, Udachhiwadi, Ekhatpur, Manjauri and Khanauri. Land acquisition for the project is expected to affect around 25,000 people.
 
 “The text of the letter has been printed and provided to the landowners. They are signing it, going to the local post office and posting it. Until now, around 500 people have already sent the letters. Each day, 100 people are going to the post office. We will not budge. We will ensure that the protest march in Pune is a success and more people join us,” a Pargaon landowner said.
