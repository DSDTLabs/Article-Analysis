GURUGRAM: To improve groundwater levels and conserve natural sources of water, the district administration — through the integrated watershed management programme (IWMP) — has said it revived 71  . 

 
 The revival of water bodies, deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, will not only make the places they are located in aesthetically better but will also give an impetus to farmers to grow crops as water will be available. 
 
 The district administration took six years and spent Rs 2 crore to complete the drive that not only revived the ponds, but also built water tanks, dams,   drains and rainwater harvesting systems. 
 
 IWMP has a 90:10 cost-sharing arrangement between the central and state governments. DK Verma, who was part of the technical team, said, “Around 18 ponds have been revived in Farrukhnagar, 32 in Sohna and 21 in Pataudi. Apart from this, 27 rooftop water harvesting systems have been set up and 27 water tanks have been set up in government schools.” 
 
 Listing out other work done under the programme, Verma said, “Water recharging units have been set up, the ponds have been connected to canals using pipelines, and ramps have been built near the ponds for animals to climb up and down. Small dams have also been built in some places to check wastage of water. Steps are also being taken to built fisheries in   village, Saramthala village, Lohasinghani village and Satlaka village.” 
 
 Talking about an initiative at Khurrampur village, Singh said a mechanism had been put in place in the village under which water drained from kitchens and bathrooms would be filtered and used to quench the thirst of animals. Farmers too can use this to water their crops in a five-acre area, he said.
