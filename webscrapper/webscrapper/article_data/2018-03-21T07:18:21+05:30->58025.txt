BENGALURU: Three   buses plying between two destinations on the same route charging different fares in a span of four days — Bengalurean Harish’s unique travel experience not only left him baffled, but also raised many eyebrows. 

    recently tweeted a picture of different ticket fares of three KSRTC   buses plying on Dobbespet-Bengaluru route. Interestingly, the public transport utility has confirmed the anomaly and even defended it, citing the burden of toll charges. Harish has also asked transport minister H M Revanna to look into the issue.
 
 While the fare mentioned in the first KSRTC Express bus (KA06F0773) tic- ket issued on March 12 was 50, the second ticket issued for another trip on March 13 in another KSRTC express bus (KA061002) cost Rs 54. The last ticket for a March 15 journey in a third express bus (KA06F1127) came to Rs 57.
 
 A senior KSRTC official admitted to the difference in fare on the same route. “This is because these buses come from different depots like Pavagada, Tumakuru and Kunigal. Some KSRTC buses have to pay two toll charges, because of which the ticket pricing is different,” the official said.
