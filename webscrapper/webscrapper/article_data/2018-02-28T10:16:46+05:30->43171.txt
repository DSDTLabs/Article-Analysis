CHANDIGARH: The festival of colours is right round the corner. And here is an opportunity to celebrate   by replacing the traditional gulal with eco-friendly and organic colours. People are preparing to turn all colourful with the city markets witnessing enthusiastic crowd. 

 Herbal colours are in huge demand and shopkeepers are selling a 30-40 gram packet for Rs 20-25. This year the shopkeepers are doing a brisk business selling Indian products that are dominating in the market as compared to the Chinese products. 
 
 There is also an increase in demand of Indian 'pichkaris' (water guns) along with the musical ones. Demand for the musical 'pichkari' has increased tremendously with children preferring these along with those in the shapes of ' ' and 'BEN10'. These water guns are made of hard plastic with one litre water storage capacity at a cost of Rs 80 while Micky Mouse pichkaris are being sold for Rs100-250. "I bought a water gun for Rs 700. It has a 5-litre storage capacity and due to this I can play for an hour continuously," said Sahil Sharma, a resident. 
 
 Children are also seen buying water balloons. Shopkeepers are selling one packet of such balloons at around Rs 80. Last year these balloons were available online, but this time these can be brought at local shops also. Also selling like hot cakes are water tanks. These can be bought for Rs 180 to Rs 350. 
 
 Pawan Sharma, a shopkeeper at Sector 26 grain market, said, "Children above 15 years have been buying these tanks with 3-4 litre capacity." 
 
 However, demand of colour spray has decreased this time. Shopkeepers are unhappy with their business so far as Holi has come at a time when board exams are round the corner and CBSE exams will also begin on March 5. "Children are busy preparing for their exams and not buying any Holi product," said Rakshit, another Sector 26 shopkeeper.
