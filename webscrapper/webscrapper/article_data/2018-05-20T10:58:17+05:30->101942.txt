PUNE: Four armed persons robbed Mahesh Havinale (22) of cash and a smartphone, collectively worth Rs15,000, near a PMPML bus stop on   bypass around 7.30pm on May 16.

 Havinale, a labourer from   Budruk, registered the complaint two days after the incident as he was terrified to disclose the incident.
 
 Sub-inspector Santosh   of the Kondhwa police said, “Mahesh was on his way home when the suspects intercepted him at the bus stop. One of the suspects threatened him with a sickle, while the others robbed him of Rs7,000 and smartphone. He did not resist them. The four fled towards Gokulnagar chowk.”
 
 Shinde said, “The labourer was so afraid that he did not tell his family members about the incident. He later disclosed the details to a friend, who, in turn, counselled him to register a complaint against the robbers.” 
 
 He said, “We are working on certain clues and hope to detect the suspects at the earliest.”
