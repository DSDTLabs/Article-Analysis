 actress   has revealed that she never wanted to get married until she met her husband   Passi de Preposulo.
According to reports, the 40-year-old   admitted she was against getting in the institution until her relationship with the fashion executive, who she met in 2012, progressed.
 
  
  
 While talking to a leading US publication, the   star said, "I never wanted to get married. When I first met my husband, he knew that marriage wasn't something I was interested in. And then as we got to know each other, the idea of marriage shifted for me. There are some things worth celebrating - and he's worth celebrating."
 
  She added, "I actually love being married. I never thought I would, but this is a spectacular human being, and I am celebrating that I get to share my life with him". The Oscar-nominated actress has been open about her decision to keep her dating life private.The actress also opened up about her unstable upbringing, admitting she discovered her own strength when she kicked her mother's boyfriend in the genitals after he struck her.
 
  "My mom was a single mom; I don't know who my biological father is, and I grew up in a household that was really financially unstable. There was a turning point in my life where we were living with someone I didn't like very much, a boyfriend of my mom's. And he did something - my room was messy or whatever and he had taken my clothes, and I was telling him to give me back my stuff - and he slapped me", explained Chastain.
 
  She continued, "And I just kicked him in the genitals, and he fell to the ground immediately. It was me, my sister and my brother - and I remember looking at my sister's face, and we were both like 'oh, my God, what did I just do?"
