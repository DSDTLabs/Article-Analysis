PATNA: One   Singh (52), an eyewitness and complainant in a triple   case, was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne criminals outside his residence in Karyanand Nagar locality of   town on Tuesday.

 Ramshekhar Singh (65), his son Sanjeev Kumar alias Jhalo Singh (38) and nephew Indrasen Kumar alias   (38) were shot dead at Pokhrama village under Kajra police station in Lakhisarai district over a property dispute on August 2 last year. Ramshekhar was Pawan’s cousin brother.
 
 SHO of Lakhisarai Town police station Rajesh Ranjan said Pawan was sitting by a bonfire when two unidentified criminals opened fire, killing him on the spot.
