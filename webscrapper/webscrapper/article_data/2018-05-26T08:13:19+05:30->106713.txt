MYSURU: Prajwal and Savitha were getting ready to celebrate their 12th wedding anniversary on Thursday, but a petty quarrel between the couple on Wednesday afternoon changed everything.

  Prajwal, 43, currently unemployed, killed Savitha, 39, by slitting her throat during the fight at their house in Basavanahalli on Wednesday, police said. Minutes later, he went to his in-laws’ house in KHB Colony where their daughter Sinchana,10,was playing with friends. He brought her home, killed her on the ground floor and shifted her body to a room upstairs by evening.
 
 Prajwal spent the night with the bodies of his wife and daughter. He left home on Thursday morning and returned late in the evening with a pesticide bottle. “On Thursday night, he decided to kill himself. Unable to drink pesticide, he cut his throat and wrist. Later, he called his father seeking help,” police said.
 
 It was around 1am that his father Ramachandra rushed home and shifted Prajwal to Apollo Hospital. Ramachandra called the control room and the cops reached the crime scene at 2.30am. “Prajwal is out of danger. He will remain in the ICU under observation for some time,” said police, quoting the doctors.
 
 Cops suspect a financial issue could have triggered the fight between the couple.
 
 Family sources said the two had purchased their Basavanahalli home for Rs 90 lakh in 2017 and moved to   after quitting their jobs in Bengaluru.
 
 Their daughter was studying in Class 4 at a private school in Mysuru.
