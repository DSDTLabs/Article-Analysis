GURDASPUR: As   cadres in Gurdaspur district continue to debate if the party should field an outsider for the Gurdaspur bypoll, party in-charge of   affairs   took feedback from the party leaders.   would further discuss this with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and state president Sunil   before the final name is forwarded to the party high command.

 “Some leaders are in a catch-22 situation as they only want Sunil Jakhar to contest but Jakhar has no local connect with the area,” said a party leader.
