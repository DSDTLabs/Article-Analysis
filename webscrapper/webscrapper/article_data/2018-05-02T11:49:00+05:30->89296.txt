CHARMINAR: Angry at the ruling TRS party and authorities for neglecting Muslim localities under Maheshwaram constituency, senior   leader   said the government has failed to fulfil promises made to Muslims before bifurcation of the twin states. 

 Congress party leaders and also workers headed by Sabita Indra Reddy on Tuesday visited Muslim areas, including Wadi-e-Mustafa, Wadi-e-Hadees, Wadi-e-Huda of the Jalpally municipality.
 
 "The Muslim localities under Maheswaram constituency have been neglected. Though several complaints and representations were made to the MLA and authorities concerned, no initiatives were taken to help people," she said.
