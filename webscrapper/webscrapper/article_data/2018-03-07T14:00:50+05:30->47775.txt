INDORE: The story of sensational murder of Bhopal's RTI activist   has stirred a   director to conceptualize it into a  .

 The idea struck after the producer Manoj Nandwana was sent a notice that accused him of stealing the storyline of Masood's life in his recently announced film: 'Murder at Koh-e-Fiza'. The film was not related to Masood case, but, the notice stirred Nandwana's curiosity to find out about the murder of RTI activist. Then, he decided to use the story of Masood's murder in his next film which is likely to be titled 'Murder at   2'. "Murder at Koh-e-Fiza will be released in April and it has no political angle and nor is the victim a woman or has any resemblance to Shehla's murder. I was surprised to know that people related my film to be based on Masood murder case," said Nandwana.
 
 The notice to Nandwana was sent by Masood's cousin Razil Zaidi, who accused him of violating the copyright to use the details of her life. "This is not your legal right as it is the legal right of the deceased's parents," the notice to the film's directors read. In the confusion regarding the name of the film and assumption that it was related to Masood murder case, a writ petition was filed by Zaidi at Bombay high court against the producer. But it was withdrawn unconditionally.
 
 RTI activist Masood was murdered outside her residence in Koh-e-Fiza on August 16, 2011. CBI arrested five accused Zahida Parvez, Saba Farooqi, Tabish, Shaquib Ali and Irrfan in connection with the case.
