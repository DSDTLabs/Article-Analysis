JAIPUR: The state law department has asked the   (UDH) department to prepare the rules for   Policy 2015. In the wake of growing public concern over radiation from mobile towers, the UDH department recently framed a telecom policy for the state. 

 At present, there is no policy in the state for erection of mobile towers. Based on the guidelines issued by the department of telecommunication, government of India on August 1, 2013, the department had framed a policy for installation of mobile communication towers. 
 
 After inviting suggestion from residents, experts and public representatives the UDH department sent the draft to law department for final examination. However, the law department has asked the UDH to first frame the law for the policy. Now, the department is framing the draft of the rules, which will be sent to the law department for final approval. “We are framing the draft proposal of the rules and after the approval the department will initiate the process of implementation,” said a senior UDH official. 
 
 As per the draft, mobile towers will not be installed on any premises if they are 15 metre or less from the boundary of any school (excluding colleges and universities), hospital, sports ground or within 500 metre radius of jail campus. 
 
 The draft prohibits the erection of   (TIT) without obtaining prior permission from the commissioner or executive officer in municipal areas, secretary of the   and development authorities in urban areas and sub-divisional magistrate in rural areas. 
 
 An NOC from the traffic police would also be mandatory once the draft is implemented. “Towers cannot be installed within a distance of 300 metre from the notified boundary of any protected monument. The installation of a tower here requires permission of the archaeology department. In Walled City area and in areas of heritage importance, the poles shall be so designed as to maintain the heritage character of the area,” further reads draft.
