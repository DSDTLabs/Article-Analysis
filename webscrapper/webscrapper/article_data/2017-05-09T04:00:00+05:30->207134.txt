VADODARA: Parents have started putting pressure on the state government to include their representatives in the   that will decide the fee structure of private schools under   (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017. 

 A group of around 25 parents on Monday approached Vadodara district education officer (DEO) M L Ratnu raising the demand to include parent representatives in the zonal fee regulation committee formed for Vadodara zone.
 
 The zonal fee regulation committee formed for Vadodara included retired judge G N Rana, retired professor and former vice-chancellor of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University R G Kothari, chartered accountant Lalit Mehta and Jagdish Shukla, a member of the executive body of Vadodara Unaided Private School Association (VUPSA). 
 
 Parents argued that all the members are nominated directly by the state government and the committee has no representation of parents making it easier for the schools to justify fee hikes to the committee. 
 
 Ratnu, however, counselled the group stating that each school has a different parent body making it difficult for the state government to select or nominate any single parent as representative. 
 
 “The entire Act itself has been formed by the state government in the interest of parents,” he said. 
 
 Under the Act, schools that want to charge fees higher than the upper limit fixed by the state government can apply to the committee of their zone. The office of this committee in Vadodara is located at District Institute for Education and Training. 
 
 The government has fixed Rs15,000 for primary, Rs25,000 for secondary and Rs27,000 for higher secondary as upper limits. 
 
 Although, many city-based schools have collected forms from the DEO office, so far not a single school has submitted application to the office. The schools which want to collect fees higher than the upper limits have been asked to submit their books of accounts to the committee.
