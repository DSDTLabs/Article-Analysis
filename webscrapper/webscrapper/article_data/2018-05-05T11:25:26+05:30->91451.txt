IMPHAL: Chief minister   on Friday said  's   town bordering   could emerge as a nerve centre for the Act East Policy. Participating in the 'Interactive Session with Chief Ministers of Northeastern States on Act East Policy' held at New Delhi,   said Moreh town should be developed with multi-speciality hospitals, diagnostic centres and educational institutions. 

 Moreh could emerge as a support centre for trade promotion activities if it has commodity exchanges, logistics servicing and warehousing facilities, Biren said in the meeting chaired by Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj. Implementation of banking facilities, easy payment modalities, quick food safety checks and single window clearances for transaction would boost trade in the region, he added. 
 
 The chief minister also said Moreh town could also be treated as a buffer area where Myanmar nationals, with permission from the Indian authorities, could vist the place to avail of the benefits on offer. Biren suggested that the integrated check posts at Moreh have to be made fully functional and the 110km Imphal-Moreh highway (NH 39) be upgraded to a double lane highway to enhance trade connectivity. The Imphal-Silchar stretch should also be improved as it is affected by frequent landslides during monsoon, he added.
