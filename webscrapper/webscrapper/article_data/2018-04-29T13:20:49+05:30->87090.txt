Seems like the coast is clear for Mohanlal’s   film titled Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham. The movie, which will be directed by  , is set to go on floors on November 1, Kerala Piravi Day. 

 On the film, Priyadarshan says, “Almost 40% of it will be shot at sea. We are yet to finalise the cast; but the movie will have stars from all industries including Bollywood. We have just completed the first draft and will take another month to zero in on the actors needed to play the parts. Right now the movie will need close to seven months of pre-production and eight months of post production.”
  
 The team is also on the lookout for a Chinese actor to play Chinali, a Chinese boy who Kunjali Marakkar IV had saved from a Portuguese ship and later became his trusted military lieutenant. “Chinali is an important character in the movie. We will also have British actors,” says the filmmaker. “History says that all four Kunjali Marakkars have served for 98 years with Kunjali Marakkar IV serving the last 12 years. Even though we are doing it in Malayalam, it will be made with a pan-Indian appeal. Naturally, a film with such a massive budget merits that kind of treatment to recover the cost.”
  
 The movie is scripted by Priyadarshan along with IV Sasi’s son Ani. “I had also discussed the thread with the scriptwriter (late) T Damodaran mash and we have incorporated a lot of his inputs in the script too,” he says.
