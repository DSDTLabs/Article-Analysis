VARANASI: Taking a dig at Prime Minister Modi,   president and CM   said Modi is now fearing a fractured mandate. "The BJP was claiming they will win 300 seats but now the PM is fearing a fractured verdict," said the CM, addressing a rally in Didarganj constituency in Azamgarh district on Tuesday. 

 Though SP patriarch   gave his parliamentary constituency a miss, Akhilesh was on a whirlwind tour of seven constituencies of the district, in which SP had won nine out of 10 seats in 2012 elections. 
 
 He said the PM's tone had changed and he could not muster courage to come to Azamgarh because he knew SP is going to win all the seats here. 
 
 A day earlier, addressing an election rally in Mau on Monday, the PM had said the SP and the BSP were trying to ensure the state threw up a fractured mandate so that they have power to bargain. 
 
 Akhilesh added that the PM should also check facts before saying anything about power supply in UP. He alleged that the PM and BJP were misleading people on demonetisation. "I have asked them to decide a place of their choice for a debate on this issue," he said and alleged that by concealing data concerning black money after demonetisation, Central government was trying to help a select few. The state government gave compensation of Rs. 2 lakh to the kin of those who died because of demonetisation, he added.
