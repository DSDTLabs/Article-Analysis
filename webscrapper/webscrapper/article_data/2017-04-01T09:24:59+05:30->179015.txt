PANAJI:  , Science and Commerce at Khandola, Marcel, became the fourth college in the state to be accredited by the   (NAAC) under its new grading system. The government college received an  , in what was its second cycle of assessment.

 It is only the second government college in the state to be accredited with an A grade. The grade was declared in the latest results released by NAAC on March 28.
 
 The NAAC peer team had visited Government College, Khandola, on March 17 and 18. As a part of the evaluation, the team visited various departments and facilities available in campus and interacted with the principal, teaching and non-teaching staff, students, parents, and alumni.
 
 Dr Jivexa Bhattacharjee, officiating principal of the college, said that it was a big honour for his college to get an A grade as the faculty members have to put in additional efforts “to transform the students who are mostly first-generation learners with relatively poor academic and financial background”.
 
 The recently-constructed building with green certification, along with its furniture and equipment meant for teaching and research, helped the government college get the A grade. The college has 21 faculty members with PhD qualification.
 
 “Publication of 193 research papers by faculty members in national and international journals, 135 research paper publications in national and international conferences and 167 faculty attendance in state, national and international conferences gained confidence of the peer team. A systematic documentation pertaining to the dissemination of the knowledge gained by faculty in research and extension services to students, and its corresponding reflections in pre-eminent results produced by the college sealed the grade,” the college principal said.
