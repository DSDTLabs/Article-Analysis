NEW DELHI: It’s increasingly a Chinese affair when it comes to cricket in India. With just days to go before the start of the   season, Chinese phone major   has bagged the principal sponsor rights for Virat Kohli-led Royal   (RCB), joining compatriots such as  , Oppo and Lenovo-owned   in grabbing rights for the country’s most-watched and highlyexpensive sport.

 Gionee is already the principal sponsor for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and its latest buy comes in at a time when it has also signed up Kohli, as its main sports brand ambassador. “Cricket and Bollywood are two religions in India.
 
 Today, a visibility in the IPL is as important for a company as it is to be there during Diwali,” Arvind Vohra, the head of Gionee in India, told TOIhere.
 
 The company — which will spend around Rs 75 crore on cricketing activities this year — will get rights for the front jersey for KKR and RCB. “Out of around 60 matches to be played in the IPL, we have now been assured of a visibility in at least 28 outings,” Vohra said.
 
 Oppo, which is expanding aggressively in India, has bet even bigger on cricket, as in March it signed a 5-year contract for being the official sponsor of the Indian cricket team. While the company does not confirm the amount it spent for bagging the five-year rights that were last held by broadcaster Star India, BCCI sources pegged it at Rs 1,079 crore.
 
 Interestingly, compatriot Vivo was the second-highest bidder with Rs 768 crore. Social commentator and brand expert Santosh Desai said that cricket is one of the most defining ways for any new brand to make a strong entry into India. “It is the easiest lever to press when it comes to cracking this market.”
