MUMBAI:  , an authorised signatory of three group firms of diamond merchant  , knocked at the doors of the Bombay high court to challenge as illegal her arrest at 8pm on February 20 in connection with the   (PNB) multi-crore fraud case. 

 Her plea filed through advocate Yashwardhan Tiwari said her entire 14 day custody is illegal too as the   ( ) as after sunset no women can be arrested, except in exceptional circumstances.
 
 Her arrest, she said was in violation of section 46 of the criminal procedure code, the rule book, that sets out how and when arrests can be made. The provision bars women from being arrested between sunset and sunrise except in exceptional circumstances. Even then a women police officer has to make a written report to obtain prior permission of a judicial magistrate within whose local jurisdiction the offence is committed or arrest is to be made.
 
 Her case is that the CBI had arrested her when she was called to join in the probe into a FIR that was registered on January 31, 2018 for offences of cheating and criminal conspiracy under the IPC and of criminal misconduct under Prevention of Corruption Act.
