Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court issued notices to the attorney general, secretaries of both central and state governments’ urban development departments, and Real Estate Regulation Authority (RERA), in yet another writ petition filed by a land development firm.

 On Friday, a division bench of justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Rohit Deo asked the respondents to submit replies by July 26.
 
 The petition was filed by Nirmal Ujjwal Credit Cooperative Society against Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Through counsel Prakash Randive, the petitioner contended that as NMC failed to issue a completion certificate despite submitting an application on March 26, 2012, their project came under the ambit of RERA Act. Subsequently, the society now has to register itself again under the new law.
 
 In the petition, the society claimed that it submitted the application for completion certificate after the entire project was completed and 80% of the houses were allotted to its customers. The society is refusing to register the completed project under the new law because of NMC’s mistake.
