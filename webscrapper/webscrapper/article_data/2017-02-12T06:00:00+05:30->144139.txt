Visakhapatnam/ Vizianagaram: After successfully completing the first phase of Nandi Natakotsavam in January, Vizianagaram is to host the second phase of the theatre fest from February 11 to 16. Speaking on the inauguration here on Saturday, district collector Vivek Yadav said the response to the first phase was overwhelming, thanks chiefly to the quality of plays and hoped that the second phase would also draw an equal number of people.

 The collector also observed that this time, troupes all the way from Ahmedabad would participate in Nandi Natakotsavam, which is a major boost to Telugu theatre. The show would go on from 9 am to 11 pm in the night, making it a 14-hour extravaganza, he said.
 
 The two major plays which opened the fest at the Ananda Gajapathi Kalakshetra were “Pellichupulu” and “Okeokkadu.” The two plays focussed on dowry and privatisation of education. In Pellichupulu, the dowry theme was criticised in a comic tone. The play is written by late playwright Satyanarayana Reddy. The second play focussed on privatisation of education and criticised schools for chasing children and their parents to enrol. 
 
 The theatre fest is drawing crowds from neighbouring districts of Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam as well. B Radhakrishna, who translated the Gurajada classic, “Kanyasulkam,” into English said, “This is a clear indication of the fact that the age of modern theatre has finally arrived. People are getting tired of the overwhelming presence of television and this would help give Telugu theatre a new lease of life.”
