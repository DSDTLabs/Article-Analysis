HYDERABAD: With the government starting the first phase of counselling to fill postgraduate medical seats, NEET-qualified students are a disappointed lot as the process does not include private colleges.

 Students say the only reason private colleges have not been included in the first phase of counselling is because of the delay in finalising fee structure. They wondered why the state was taking so long to fix fees. “If the government fixed the fee structure for private colleges, all students would have been exercising web options for the first phase of counselling. This would have been ideal as even we would have some clarity on colleges, courses, and seats available,” said Dr  , a PG aspirant. 
 
 He went so far as to say that private colleges were using delaying tactics so that they could ‘sell’ seats at a higher price. “The colleges will take their own sweet time to come to terms with fee structure and then will try to convert convener seats into management or   quota so that they can make more money,” he said.
 
 Karunakar Reddy, vicechancellor,   said that as per SC order, counselling should end by May 31. “As (private colleges) agree with the state on the fee structure, their seats will be added,” said Reddy. He said   seats will be made available to everybody in later phases
