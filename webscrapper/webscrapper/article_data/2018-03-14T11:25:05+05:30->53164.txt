NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of   on Monday rejected the plea of social worker   on restraining any organization from using ‘Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)’ as their name till his another case, demanding the same title, demanded to his organization is disposed of.

 The petitioner had earlier filed case with the joint charity commissioner’s office here, with the same demand which was rejected after a long time. He then challenged it in the high court, where too he faced the rejection.
 
 Earlier, he also applied to the joint charity commissioner for demanding RSS title for his social organization, which was rejected. He then challenged this decision in the HC which was pending.
 
 Prior to that, the social activist through counsel   filed a PIL, contending that though RSS is an unregistered organization, still the civic body is extending undue favours to them at taxpayers expense. In a series of reports, TOI exposed that though the rules make an exception for notified tourist sites or pilgrim places like Deekshabhoomi, the RSS headquarters is neither of these.
