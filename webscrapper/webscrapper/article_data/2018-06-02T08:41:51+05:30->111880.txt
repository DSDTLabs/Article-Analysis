LUCKNOW: Miffed over the delay by state government in recommending names of some senior bureaucrats for  , the UP   has approached the Centre seeking an amendment in its policy of posting officers at the rank of additional secretary and secretary. The demand was raised by the association during a recent executive committee meeting in Lucknow. 

 The association has dashed off a letter to the   (DoPT), saying that the career prospects of officers get hampered because of the delay on behalf of state government in forwarding their names at the level of joint secretary even though they apply online.
 
 As per DoPT rules, an officer is required to serve at the rank of joint secretary for a period of three years to become eligible for appointment at the level of additional secretary. The delay by state government in forwarding names of officers eventually denies them timely opportunity to get empanelled for additional secretary and secretary at Centre.
 
 "It was felt that with overall shortage of officers, it is entirely possible, although not preferred, that some state governments do not forward names of willing officers for joint secretary level posting. 
 
 In such cases, not only is the said officer being denied an opportunity to work at joint secretary level but because of DoPT's above mentioned rule, is further becoming ineligible for further empanelment for reasons that are patently beyond their control," the letter (dated May 29) duly signed by UP IAS association secretary   reads.
