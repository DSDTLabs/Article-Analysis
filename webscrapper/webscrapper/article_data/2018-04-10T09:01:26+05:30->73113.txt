It’s a claim that enrages most scientists, but it seems that a third of millennials still think that the Earth is flat. A recent study conducted by YouGov of 8,215 US adults has discovered that just 66% of 18 to 24-year-olds are convinced that the Earth is round.

 
 Now there is a strong chance that millennials are just trolling surveys as the likelihood of an internet prank is not beyond the realms of possibility.
 
 The results of the research suggest that this is a phenomenon that dwindles as a person gets older, with 94% of people aged 55 and over subscribing to the theory. Other data showed that 86% of men believed that the Earth was round while only 83% of women shared the belief.
 
 Income levels among those who took part in the research also altered dramatically. Only 79% of people earning under $40,000 said that they always thought the Earth was round, whereas it shot up to 92% for people who earned $80,000 or more.
 
 Lastly, religious beliefs also suggested that it played a part in people’s perceptions of the  . More than 50% of Flat Earthers regard themselves as being ‘very religious’, while only 17% of the group said they were ‘not religious’.
 
 In a blog about the results,   said, “For some flat Earthers, evidence of the Earth’s shape may be found in scripture – more than half of Flat earthers (52%) consider themselves ‘very religious,’ compared to just a fifth of all Americans (20%).” “While an overwhelming majority of Americans (84%) believe that the Earth is round, at least 5% of the public say they used to believe that but now have their doubts.”
 
 We can’t really make many connections between religion and Flat Earthers, but it’s not surprising that more younger people are into the idea than others.
