VISAKHAPATNAM: On March 18, while touring the historic Old Town, a group of   enthusiasts noticed encroachments upon the 17th century   cemetery grounds near the Kurupam market. A five-storey building has come up in the northern side of the   and a boundary wall has also been constructed. When brought to the notice of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation authorities, on Monday evening, they demolished the wall. 

 The   has been estimated to be about 8 feet by 60 feet. One of the gates of the new building also opens onto the cemetery. “We brought it to the notice of the   chief M Harinarayanan, who said he would get it examined by the town planning officers,” said  , one of the organisers of Sunday’s Old Town heritage walk. Notwithstanding the prompt action by GVMC that helped prevent further encroachment, it is interesting to note that the building was under construction since 2016. The GVMC had then given the permission, but had failed to check whether the structure would encroach upon the cemetery.
