NEW DELHI: DMRC has started extending the high-speed Airport Express Line deeper into   with the construction work of an underground stretch.

 
  
  
 
 
 
 “The length of the proposed extension is 1.7km with standard gauge,” a spokesperson of Delhi   Rail Corporation (DMRC) said. An underground station is planned inside the ECC complex with a subway — built using the ‘cut and cover’ method — linking it with the convention centre. 
 
 The detailed project report for the proposed extension has been approved by the Centre, the spokesperson added.
 
 The Rs 310-crore project is likely to be completed in the next two and a half years. 
 
 The high-speed Airport Express Line now connects New Delhi metro station to   21 station, with four stations in between — Shivaji Stadium, Dhaula Kuan, Delhi Aerocity and   Airport (Terminal 3). 
 
 DMRC was requested by the central government to extend the high-speed line to the exhibition and convention centre, which will be the first of its kind facility in west Delhi. The state-of-the-art centre, on the lines of Pragati Maidan and India Habitat Centre, will be equipped to host seminars, conventions and large-scale exhibitions. 
 
 With Airport Express Line reaching the convention centre, it will be easier for people from across the city to reach there. The centre is expected to witness a huge footfall, which will increase the passenger traffic on the line as well. The daily ridership on the line is now around 55,000. 
 
 DMRC is procuring 36 coaches, which will result in six extra trains for the corridor when services are extended to Dwarka Sector 25. The trains will be standard gauge with a top speed of 132kmph.
