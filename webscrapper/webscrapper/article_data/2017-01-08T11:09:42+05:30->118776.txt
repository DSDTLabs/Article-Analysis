THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Disposal of daily waste will be a headache for the elders but for students of   LP School, managing waste means easy routine that mints money. The students dispose of the food waste from the breakfast and lunch at the organic waste converter (OWC), which would convert it into manure. The school has around 1,000 kids who dispose of around 25kg of food wastes on a daily basis and the OWC would produce a subsequent amount of manure which is sold inside the school campus.

 The school authorities claim that the venture has turned out to be a huge success with the daily production of manure being sold out successfully. “On an average, around 10kg of organic manure is produced on a daily basis. Each packet carrying 500g manure is sold for Rs25. We are happy to see students, staff and local residents purchase them regularly,” said TA Jacob, a teacher at the Cotton Hill LPS. 
 
 After the successful sale at the school, the packets were sold at the  , which was the main venue of the  . The counter for organic manure sold around 35 packets in four days, upholding the green protocol implemented by the corporation. 
 
 “The income from selling these manure packets will be used for the welfare of students who come from financially backward families. On an average, we make a profit of Rs350 on a daily basis,” said Sudharmayi Devi, principal investigator of the project at Cotton Hill LPS. 
 
 The OWC was installed in the school by Innovation Experience along with the Kerala Agricultural University four months ago. “The machine grinds and decomposes the food waste in the reactor vessel after liquid reagents provided by the KAU are added to the composite mixture. The mixture is either dried using a coir pith or sun-dried in some cases. The final mix is then fortified by mixing mineral-rich powders given by the agricultural university to make it a complete, balanced and enriched manure,” said Shyam Kumar, MD, Innovation Experience.
