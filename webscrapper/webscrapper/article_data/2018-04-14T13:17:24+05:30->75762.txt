RAJKOT: Tension is brewing in   after a 20-year-old  , who had immolated herself on April 6, succumbed to the burns on Friday.

 In her dying declaration, victim Rekhaba Jadeja told the police that she was taking the drastic step due to constant harassment and threats by seven persons from the   community. She said she was unable to move out of her house as one or the other among the seven threatened and harassed her.
 
 As soon as the news of her death spread, members of local Karni Sena reached the hospital. The outfit and the girl’s family refused to accept the body until the seven persons, whom she had named, are arrested. They also demanded immediate suspension of Rapar police station constable who had allegedly refused to take Jadeja’s harassment complaint.
 
 The root of the quarrel between the Jadeja and Koli families was the murder of a Koli youth whose body was found near Neelpar village eight months ago. The Koli family suspected the involvement of Jadejas in the murder and approached the police. But Rapar police did not find any evidence, suggesting that the girl’s family was involved in the murder and therefore did not detain or arrest them.
 
 However, seven Koli community persons, that included four brothers, allegedly started harassing the girl. They allegedly barged into her house with arms when she was alone and threatened to kidnap her. Her family then went to Rapar police station to lodge a complaint of harassment against the seven. But the constable there allegedly did not register the offence.
 
 Jadeja named Ramesh Koli and his three brothers — Kanji, Jignesh and Haresh — Tebha Koli and his brother Suresh and Ishwar Koli for harassment. All have been booked for abetment to suicide.
