Gurgaon: Late on Sunday night, a drunk youth in Gurgaon dragged a 22-year-old woman out of a car and raped her on the roadside in Sector 57, while his three accomplices, also drunk, thrashed her husband and accompanying relatives. On Monday, police arrested the rapist and his three accomplices, and recovered a car from their possession. Police are now questioning the accused, who will be produced before a city court by Tuesday. This is the 10th case of rape reported in Haryana in 10 days, and the fourth case in Gurgaon in the same period. According to police, the incident happened around midnight on Sunday, on the 200ft road behind Business Park Tower in Sector 57. Relatives of the survivor, to whose house in Tighra village she had been visiting on a dinner invite with her husband, were giving them a drop home in South City 1, in their white Ertiga car. The survivor, who hails from West Bengal and lived with her husband in a rented accommodation in South City 1, told police they had gone for dinner in Tighra village to the home of her husband’s elder brother, reaching there at 7pm. After dinner, since it was late, the hosts offered to drop them back home in their car. There were six people in the car, including the brother in-law’s son, who was at the wheel. “Around 15 minutes after we had left my brother in-law’s home, while we were crossing the 200ft road behind Business Park Tower, my husband asked his nephew who was driving to stop to relieve himself. As my husband left, his nephew also stepped out to drink water. In the meantime, two cars arrived and stopped near our car. There were two men in each car. They appeared to be drunk, and started asking the nephew why we had stopped there. By then, my husband had returned, and joined the discussion,” the survivor said.  “Within minutes, it turned into a free-for-all, as the men began thrashing my husband and his nephew. I sat numb on my seat, when one of them spotted me and dragged me out,” the survivor added.
