VISAKHAPATNAM: A novel protest against the Centre’s denial of   to Vizag in the Union budget was held in the city on Sunday.

 S Hemanth Kumar, president of 11th ward of Greater Visag Municipal Corporation from YSR Congress party, held the protest by standing on his knees with a single demand — a separate railway zone with Vizag as its headquarters. Kumar warned the Centre that the party will start a movement if the centre failed to address the long-pending issue of a separate railway zone in Vizag.
 
 Holding placards against central government ministers and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, Kumar said they will keep coming come up with similar novel protests till they hear some good news about the railway zone issue. He said the railway zone headquarters should be situated in Vizag only. “We will not accept the zone if its headquarters are set up in Vijayawada, Guntur or Gunthakal,” he warned.
 
 Leaders of other opposition parties also came up with the same demand by staging protests over the failure of the state and central leaders to announce the formation of a new railway zone in the budget and non-implementation of assurances given during bifurcation
