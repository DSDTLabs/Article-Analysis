NEW DELHI: The LG’s office on Thursday countered the AAP government’s allegation on the director of information and said the elected government tried to “intimidate the   in question   by issuing various threats”.

 The   has asserted that the request to change Sarangi has to be seen in the context of his performance as an officer. He said Sarangi’s department pointed out continuing violations of   guidelines on government advertising by the AAP government.
 
 The LG also said that it has received complaints from Sarangi about being harassed and abused by deputy CM  , especially on November 28 last year when the deputy CM allegedly threatened to make his life hell. Sarangi filed a written complaint and fears for his life, the LG office said.
