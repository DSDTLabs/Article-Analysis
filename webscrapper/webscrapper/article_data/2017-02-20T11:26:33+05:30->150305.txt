ALLAHABAD: The SP-Congress tie-up is an alliance of corruption and crime, and sooner or later, Congress would ditch the SP as the party has the history of being loyal only to the Nehru-Gandhi family and its members, said the Union minister of electronic and information technology,  . 

 Prasad, who was in the city to campaign for the BJP candidates, said, "Yeh party aisi hai jo Nehru-Gandhi khandan ke alaawa kissi ki sagi nahi hui to wo aap ki kya hogi (this is one party which has never been loyal to anyone, so why would it be loyal to SP)." 
 
 Launching a broadside on the SP for its so-called development work, Prasad said that there has been zero investment of the companies in the past five years of the SP rule in the state. Owning to the poor law and order, companies are reluctant to go beyond Noida and Greater Noida, he added. 
 
 Hitting hard at Mayawati, the minister said that her tenure was not better in any terms as there was selective control on crime during her rule.
