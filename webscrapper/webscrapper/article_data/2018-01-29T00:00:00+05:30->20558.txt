His grandfather,  , popularly known as SSR, had carved a niche for himself in the film industry. And now, his grandson,  , is excited that he is getting a chance to prove his mettle in the industry. The youngster will be making his debut in Kollywood with  , directed by  .

 Ask Aaryann if acting has always been his career choice, and he says with conviction, “Both acting and music. I have a graduation degree in visual communication, and was in fact, in talks with the makers of this film to work in the music department. But they thought I’d be apt for the lead role as well and that’s how I landed the offer. The script is intriguing, and is about how social network has become an integral part of our lives. Today, we meet people on the internet and take our friendship forward based on what they say. The film is about two people who meet on one such network. The story moves in real-time, with no over-the-top drama or other disturbances.”
 
 Aaryann admits that his grandfather has a huge influence on him. “He was among those few artistes who could act and sing. He was from the theatre background, and his method of acting was quite interesting. I used to speak to him in length about his days in the industry; he would tell me how actors in those days wouldn’t rely on glycerin to cry. He was passionate about his art and I have learnt a lot from him,” he says.
 Is being SSR’s grandson an added advantage for him? “Well, it that doesn’t guarantee my success in the industry. Earlier, a good film had the scope to run in theatres for more than three months. But today, so many films get made and it’s a huge achievement if a film runs for three weeks. The competition has increased, and everyone has to prove themselves, irrespective of their lineage,” he signs off.
