MOHALI: The local bodies department of Punjab has sought a report for the action taken over the alleged involvement of junior assistant of   (MC), Kesar Singh, with the   owners who have been letting loose their cattle in public areas after milking.

 Confirming the development, MC commissioner Sandeep Hans said, “We have received a letter from the local bodies department seeking reply on the Kesar Singh issue. Kesar Singh has been transferred and will no longer be heading the   catching team. I am conducting the inquiry on my own about the allegations. He has been asked to file his reply and further action will be taken once the inquiry is completed.” At present Kesar Singh has not been assigned any duty in any of the MC departments and has been kept a bay from direct public interface.
 
 The letter came after local MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu had lodged a complaint with local bodies department highlighting the alleged nexus of the junior assistant of MC with dairy owners. Recently Kesar Singh had accused Mohali legislator Balbir Singh Sidhu of misbehaviour, using non-parliamentary language and restricting   of performing his duties.
 
 The roles of other officials of the MC have come under scanner too.
 
 The issue was highlighted when Balbir Singh Sidhu during his visit to inspect a park in Sector 71 on September 12 found six cattle tied in the park but before the cattle-catching team could reach the spot, one of the MC officials informed the cattle owner after which the owner immediately removed the cattle from the spot. 
 
 Owners of 2 marla plot houses have alleged that stray cattle are being left at parks by the cattle owners only with the aid of MC officials.
