Jalpaiguri: The Binay Tamang-led Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) announced at Jalpaiguri’s Bagrakote on Thursday that they would support Trinamool in the Bengal ruling party’s strongholds in the plains in the upcoming panchayat polls and Trinamool will in turn support   candidates in pro-party pockets.

 This was a major setback for BJP that was banking on Nepali voters to make a mark in the tea belt of North Bengal. It was its alliance with Bimal Gurung-led GJM that had won BJP the Madarihat seat in the 2016 assembly polls.
