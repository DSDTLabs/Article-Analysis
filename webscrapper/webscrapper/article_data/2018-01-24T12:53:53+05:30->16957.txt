COIMBATORE: With a dip in tax collection, the   has earned the lowest revenue this year compared to the last three years. The collection so far has been Rs 85cr, only 54% of the target. 

 Delimitation work,   and revenue reassessment work took a toll on the revenue collection, corporation officials said. “We will catch up in the next two months,” said an official. 
 
 The target for this year was Rs 158cr. “Last year, during the same time, we collected 75% of the target, which amounted to Rs 103cr. The last year’s target was Rs 138cr. There was a 20% increase in the collection last year, mainly due to demonetisation,” a revenue department official told TOI.
 
 The official also blamed the centralised software - Urban Tree - that was introduced by the state government in November. “As the computer servers were down, people were unable to make payments. Usually, the weekly revenue during November and December is Rs 5cr. But, due to software issues, we were able to collect only Rs 1.5cr,” he said.
 
 Even now, the server issues have not been fixed in central and north zones, where residents find it impossible to pay taxes online. 
 
 “Various educational institutions, whose tax collection was stuck in litigations, were also added in the total demand. Since the demand increased by Rs 20cr, the percentage has come down,” said an official.
 
 “Usually, we disconnect water connections and take other measures to improve revenue collection. We have already begun sending notices to the defaulters,” said assistant commissioner, revenue, Ravikumar.
 
 City corporation commissioner   said that while the collection was lower, the officials will complete more than 90% of the collection in the next two months.
