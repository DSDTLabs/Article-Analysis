KOCHI: Absence of adequate buses to and fro the medical college has been a headache for patients and bystanders. As only a few buses are plying via the college route, patients and bystanders will have to spend more money on hiring autorickshaws and cabs.

 KSRTC buses ply via   which is just one-and-a-half km away from the college at intervals of 10 to 15 minutes. If these buses are diverted through the college, it will address the transportation problems of patients. District collector who is the head of   (RTA) which is to fix routes of buses alone can solve the issue. TOI had brought the issue to the attention of district collectors, RTOs, KSRTC zonal officers and chairpersons of   municipality who were in charge time to time; nobody took any step to provide more bus services to the college.
 
 Kalamassery municipality is constructing a bus station in front of the college. It is learnt that the bus station would be ready by next month. “We have send a letter to the collector requesting him to divert more buses through the area. We will be meeting transport minister A K   for pressing the demand,“ said  , chairperson, Kalamassery municipality.
