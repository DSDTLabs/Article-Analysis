PANAJI: The   hike in  , effective from Saturday, was reduced to 80 paise after   cut the fuel cost by Rs 3.77 per litre on Friday evening. Petrol, which now costs Rs 60.37 per litre, will now be sold at Rs 61.17.

 The  , which was not allowed to cross the Rs 60-mark by the BJP government due to a 2012 poll promise, has been necessitated after finance minister Manohar Parrikar more than doubled the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel from 7% to 15% in the latest budget.
 
 Commissioner of commercial taxes Dipak Bandekar told TOI that the price hike will come into effect from midnight of Friday. 
 
 The state government is expecting to generate a revenue of around Rs 125 crore with this hike.
 
 Chief minister Manohar Parrikar, in his budget speech, had said that the government had ensured that the prices of motor spirit (petrol) did not cross the threshold level of Rs 60 per litre for the last five years, and had been able to maintain the promise given to the people of the state in 2012. 
 
 He had added that the price of petrol in Goa is significantly lower compared to that in the neighbouring states of Karnataka and Maharashtra, where the fuel is sold at Rs 72 and Rs 76, respectively. 
 
 In April 2012, Parrikar had reduced VAT on petrol from 20% to 0.1% to offer relief to the common man reeling under the constant rise in petrol prices.
