Panaji: Fomento Group has, on Tuesday, paid its contract workers at various mining and mining-related locations full settlement for a year, a senior management official of the company told TOI, adding that the company’s move comes in the light of the current uncertain situation prevalent in Goa’s mining sector.  “This will give all such individuals financial support to sustain themselves while they look for alternative work. As we in Goa are under difficult times, everybody is attempting to do what is best under the circumstances,” the Fomento Group official said. TOI had reported earlier this month that the Fomento group had asked around 800 of its management level staffers to resign and look for jobs elsewhere. A source had said the company took the decision as it could not limit staffers’ career prospects by asking them to stay back in Goa.  This month, the mining division of the Chowgule Group also asked around 500 of its workers not to report to work pursuant to the Supreme Court order mandating the stoppage of mining operations in Goa. Similarly, in March, Sesa Mining Corporation Ltd, a Vedanta group company, had asked all its employees not to report to work with immediate effect. Sources had said Vedanta has started transferring its management staff to company units outside the state. On February 7, the Supreme Court, in a major blow to the mining sector in Goa, quashed 88 mining leases granted to companies by the state government in 2015.  State and central government have been asked to take steps to grant fresh mining leases in accordance with the law and also recover amounts from companies for indulging in illegal mining. This has created uncertainty as to when mining operations will actually be able to resume in the state.
