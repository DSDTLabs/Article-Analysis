BENGALURU: The family of a 21-year-old youth, who was declared brain dead four days after he was involved in a road accident on New Year’s Eve, has donated several of his organs. Amith (name changed) was riding pillion when the bike — a Bullet — skidded. While the rider, a friend, is in a coma, Amith was declared brain dead after a four-day battle for life. Amith was riding without a helmet and his father claims he would still be alive had be worn one.

 The organs of the diploma holder were harvested on Wednesday at  , where Amith was being treated. Ruing his son’s decision not to wear a helmet, B K Ramesh, the youth’s father, said: “A split-second decision to wear a helmet, may have saved my son. He usually wore a helmet whenever he was out on a bike. But when he left for a nearby shop with a friend at about 7.30 pm on December 31, he didn’t wear one.” The bike skidded, throwing both riders to the ground. Amith’s friend is 16 and is being treated at a private hospital.
 
 Amith was in the business of servicing water pipelines. His father is a farmer from Jinke Bettalli, near Doddaballapur and wasn’t aware that organs could be donated. “I was only aware of eye donation,” Ramesh said. “But doctors informed us about the life-saving potential of my son’s organs. We thought at least his organs should light the lives of others.”
 
 Officials said Amith’s kidneys could not be harvested due to high creatinine levels. “His lungs were airlifted to a 52-year-old man in Chennai and his liver was transplanted to a 65-year-old man at Aster CMI hospital,” said an officer at Jeevasarthakathe, the government of Karnataka’s cadaver organ transplant authority. “His heart valves were sent to the   in Chennai and corneas to patients in Narayana Netralaya.”
 
 Amith’s organs are the first to be transplanted in 2018. Seventy cadaver organ donations took place in   last year.
