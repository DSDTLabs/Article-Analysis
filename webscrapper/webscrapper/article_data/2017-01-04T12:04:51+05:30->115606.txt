PANAJI: Public works department (PWD) contract workers’ union on Tuesday expressed anger and frustration towards   for not regularising contractual jobs even after approaching chief minister   and PWD minster  , alias Sudin, several times. At present there are 1,230 contractual workers in the union.

 Union leader Swati Kerkar said,“Contract workers have been ill-treated. They are not paid their salaries on time and sometimes payments are pending for over five months. We are strongly against BJP. They have cheated the common man and we are highly dissatisfied with what they have done to us.”
 
 “We will continue this fight until we get justice. BJP has done no good to us, they have always made fake promises,” she added.
 
 “We will work only against the BJP government. They have made our lives miserable. Our jobs are not secure as the contract will be culminated soon and we will be jobless. We have been cheated and we will fight back,” said another contract worker Dhamu Gaude. tnn
