 Actor Chetan Pandit has been roped in to play Chanakya in Siddharth Kumar Tewary’s 'Porus'. Interestingly, he has played Chanakya earlier, during his days at the National School of Drama (NSD). He says, “I played Chanakya in a play, when I was a student in NSD. I have been wanting to repeat the role on screen, as the character is very strong.” While he had shaved his head previously, the actor is using a wig this time around. He shares, “This is a limited series. I would have gone bald if it had run for a longer period. It’s a bit difficult when I have to work on other projects simultaneously. Also, nowadays there are so many bald wigs, which look almost real.”
