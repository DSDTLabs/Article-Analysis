GREATER NOIDA: A man allegedly claimed himself as a   activist and threatened the chairman of   (YEIDA) that he would complain to a minister if his work was not done.

 Kapil Kumar, a resident of Gharondi village in  , was arrested after chairman Prabhat Kumar filed a police complaint on Monday. Sources said Kapil came to the YEIDA office on Monday morning and started threatening officials. Prabhat Kumar said Kapil had been putting pressure on YEIDA and GNIDA officials to clear some abadi plots to some farmers. 
 
 “Kapil started threatening me as well, saying he would complain to a minister in the government. I called up police,” the YEIDA chairman said. Kapil was then arrested from the office itself. 
 
 “The police have seized many passbooks, chequebooks, pen drives, PAN cards, stamps, and a diary with account numbers and other details from Kapil,” Prabhat Kumar added. 
 
 Sources said the accused would earlier associate himself with the Samajwadi Party when it was the ruling party. This time, he posed as a BJP member and threatened officials with dire consequences. He dropped names of well-known politicians, including ministers, to pressurise the officials. 
 
  “Law will take its course and the guilty will be brought to book,” Prabhat Kumar said.
 
 Brijesh Kumar Verma, the SHO of Kasna police station, said the crime branch was questioning the accused. “Sections of the IPC will be invoked accordingly and action will follow,” the SHO said.
