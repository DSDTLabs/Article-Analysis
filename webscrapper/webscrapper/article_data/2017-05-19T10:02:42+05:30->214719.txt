NASHIK: For nearly 10 months, the Railways have failed to   to look after 28 pay & use toilets at the Nashik Road   

 Nashik Road railway station was ranked 169th among the 322 A category stations across the country in the Third Party Audit Survey Report for 2017 that Railways released on Wednesday. Last year, the station was ranked 6th in the survey. 
 
 The report highlighted that about 41% of the citizens surveyed found the   station toilets unclean. The audit team that examined the station for the survey gave a paltry 41.88% score for the functioning of the cleaning staff.
 
 “For nearly 10 months, there is no contractor to oversee and maintain the 28 pay & use toilets that we have at the station premises. This is affecting the cleanliness of these toilets,” admitted an official of Nashik Rd  . 
 
 Even in terms of manpower to deal with cleanliness of toilets and other parts of the station, there is a need appoint additional 15 persons. “At present, we have 25 personnel on contract and nine railway employees to look after cleanliness. But given the number of toilets and the vast area of the station, we need at least 15 more persons to carry out this task effectively,” claimed sources at the railway station.
 
 Insiders of the Nashik Road station said it was the responsibility of the Bhusawal division of Central Railway to float tenders and finalise the contractor for the pay & use toilets. “We do not have any role in the appointment of the contractor,” said a local railway official. 
 
 Chief of the NGO,  , Bipin Gandhi demanded that contractors be appointed immediately. “The railway officials concerned must be pulled up for their slackness in finalising the contractor. When the Railway ministry is taking efforts to keep stations clean, such acts should not be tolerated,” Gandhi said.
 
 Nashik Road station manager M B Saxena refused to comment on the issue but admitted that there are no contractors to look after the pay & use toilets.
