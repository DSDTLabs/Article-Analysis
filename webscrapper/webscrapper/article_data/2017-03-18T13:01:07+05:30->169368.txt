CHANDIGARH: The standoff between the Jats and the   government intensified on Friday after Jat leader   ruled out any kind of dialogue with Haryana, saying, "Now the dialogue will be held in Delhi, that too with the Union government.’’ In a related development, the Haryana government on Friday banned mobile internet in Rohtak, Bhiwani, Sonipat and Jhajjar districts in the wake of the Delhi March call for March 20 given by   (AIJASS) earlier this month.

 Malik told TOI that for the past one year Jat community had been interacting with the Haryana government. "They can impose any kind of ban on mobiles. Our workers don’t use anything and message has already gone to the Jats across the country. They will manage at their own,’’ said Malik. As far as discussions are concerned, now it would happen only with the Union government, that too following an intervention of a Union minister. We shall certainly have a meeting with government, but with the Union government, and that too on March 20," Malik said.
 
 Pressing their demands related to OBC quota and relief and rehabilitation of those killed and injured during the Jat stirl 2016, the the Jat community across Haryana is on a stir under the banner of AIJASS. The Jat leaders and the government panel headed by education minister   on Wednesday finalized the modalities of an agreement to be signed between Jat leaders and the CM of Haryana on Thursday. Things did not work out as the final meeting could not be held, triggering another round of war of words by Jat leaders. Amid announcement of an agreement made by education minister Ram Bilas Sharma on Thursday afternoon, Malik announced that the programme to ghereo Delhi on March 20 will happen as per schedule.
