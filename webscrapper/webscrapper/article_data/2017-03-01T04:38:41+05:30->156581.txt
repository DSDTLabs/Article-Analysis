Surat: City police and   ( ) staff have begun to carry out simultaneous surveys at multiple locations in the city to hunt for complaints of illegal parking that continue to trouble people. 

 The first phase of the drive will see one major road in each of the seven municipal zones being covered. This exercise will be replicated in other areas after the completion of the first phase. Police are identifying locations where vehicles have been parked on roads and sharing the details with SMC for an analysis of the situation. SMC officials are visiting buildings with the approved plan and examining if there has been any encroachment of the parking area earmarked in the plan. They are also examining if maximum available space has been used for parking or not. The SMC official are clicking photos on their mobile phones for assessment and record. 
 
 “The process to survey parking places at different buildings in the city has been initiated by the police and the SMC. We are working to ensure that vehicles don’t encroach upon the roads,” city police commissioner   said.
 
 Parking areas in many commercial buildings have been illegally covered. There is a limit to the number of vehicles which can use them. At many places, the parking areas are blocked and visitors cannot use them, forcing them to park their vehicles on the road. 
 
 “In the first phase, the survey is being done on one road in each zone. After examining the results, the survey will be expanded to cover other areas of the city. We will be able to learn different things from the first phase which will help us to handle the initiative in a better way during the later stages of the drive,” municipal commissioner M. Thennarasan said. 
 
 SMC is exploring options to develop multi-level parking in different areas. Police officials and SMC authorities will hold a meeting in a week’s time to discuss the findings of the first phase of their drive.
