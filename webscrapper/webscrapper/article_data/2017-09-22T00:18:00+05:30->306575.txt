Tirupur: In a first in the district, a group of top-level managers of knitwear manufacturing companies will be trained professionally in production management by a renowned private consultancy firm from Sri Lanka.

 The eight-day training, to be held in two phases at the NIFT-TEA College of Knitwear Fashion, will begin in the last week of October. The first phase will be held from October 24-27 and the second, from October 31 to November 3.
 
 Tirupur Exporters Association (TEA), which is organising the event, said the programme will focus on industrial engineering, quality and human resource managements, apart from production management. The training is limited to 30 persons and will cost Rs 40,000 per head.
 
 “The knitwear industry in the dollar city has evolved into an international market. Still, traditional practices are in place, which are not on par with the international best practices,” said C P Senthil Kumar, head, research and development, NIFT-TEA College of Knitwear Fashion.
 
 “The industry here is mostly “boss-driven” rather than “system-driven”. The companies don’t spend time or concentrate on pre-planning,” said R R Srinivasan, chairman of academic committee of the college.
 
 Sri Lankan apparel manufacturers have, meanwhile, developed one of the most effective production methods, where pre-planning matters the most. “In the apparel manufacturing, fabric constitutes 70% of cost. Sri Lankan companies, hence, plan in advance ways to avoid wastage of the fabric,” said Srinivasan, adding, “With a proven production method, an expert team from Buildtek Consultants Private Limited will train the top-level managers of different companies in the district.”
 
 Though the programme is limited to 30 participants, the plan is to churn out trainers from the group for the benefit of the remaining top-level managers.
