AHMEDABAD: Sometimes, Amdavadi rasikas’ applause is heard over the invisible wall of convention that has been conceived to protect performers from the distraction of appreciation. In fact,  , the santoor god, has often had to remind audiences at   that he does like to receive accolades during — or even after — alaap. He has said on the Saptak stage that alaap is a meditative retreat for him. On Sunday, Panditji told TOI: “This time people remembered my advice!” His indulgent laugh was of the kind that signals the acceptance of brilliant people who occasionally act in maverick ways.

 The musical acumen of Saptak audiences has often been lauded from the artists’ side of the invisible wall. “Ustad Shahid Parvez says that he makes special preparations for Saptak,” said  , the force behind the music conference. “He says audiences in Ahmedabad have helped him tune into some of his most inspired intuitions.” Ustad Parvez, a celebrated sitarist, performed on Sunday. “He rendered Raga Gavati,” Mehta said. “I sensed spiritual elevation while listening to him. He also played Kafi briefly.”
 
 
  
 
 The last programme of Sunday brought together a group of percussionists, led by   on tabla. “There was wonderful coordination between the performers,” Mehta said. So, the audience was first taken on an inward journey and then made part of a throbbing discussion among drums. The programme design seemed to have been created to pay tribute to Saptak’s rasikas’ reflective nature as well as their unpretentious exuberance.
