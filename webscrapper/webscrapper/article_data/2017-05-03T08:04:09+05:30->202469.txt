CHENNAI: Nearly 13% of candidates who appeared for the JEE (Main) in Tamil Nadu have qualified for the JEE (Advanced) this year. According to statistics provided by  , a total of 48,618   wrote the exam from the state of which 6254 qualified for the next round. This means, about one in every 8 candidates have qualified. Qualified candidates will next appear for the advanced round to be held on May 21.

 These 2.7% of candidates from the state have made it among the 2.21 lakh students who have qualified for the   across the country. 
 
 Of these, 207 were from open category, 4551 from OBC, 1433 from SC and 63 from ST categories.
 
 Last year, more than 4,100 students qualified for the JEE (Advanced). Although exact number of qualifiers wasn’t available, a total of 4,147 students had registered for the JEE (Advanced) round.
 
 An IIT faculty member said while the number of candidates in appearing is not very high usually, the quality of candidates is better when compared to other states. This was reflected in last year’s JEE statistics too. While Tamil Nadu had the least number of students among the southern states, the percentage of qualifying candidates trailed only slightly behind AP and Telangana which had double or more than double of the number of candidates appearing for the exam.
 
 S Vaidhyasubramaniam, dean, Sastra University said the number of registrations from Tamil Nadu for JEE has been disproportionately less when compared to other states. This has been the case during the previous years as well.
 
 “Though the absolute increase (12.8%) in the number of TN students qualifying for JEE advanced seems to be higher than last year, the disproportionate number of students appearing from a large state like Tamil Nadu needs to be addressed adequately. As a first step, JEE (Main) must be made compulsory for deemed universities before becoming a national testing facility as envisaged,” he added.
