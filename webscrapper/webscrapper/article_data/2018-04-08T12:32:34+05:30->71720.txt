 Heidi Klum said at the age of 44 she is not searching for the fountain of youth and is trying to embrace ageing. 
 
  
  The fashionista said she does not believe in holding onto the past and is fine with getting older. 
 
 "My nose would grow like Pinocchio's if I said that I didn't feel some pressure about ageing, as I am constantly asked about it. I'm in the public eye, and there's more scrutiny because of that. I can look at photos of when I was 24, and of course I am going to look different now at 44 and having had four children - but, again, it's about being comfortable with yourself and what you see in the mirror. 
 
  "I'm not trying to hold on to the past or searching for a fountain of youth. We are all going to age, so I'm trying to embrace that, but not without a bit of a fight. If I could go back in time, I would appreciate each moment more. When I was younger, I was always looking ahead and how to get there faster. Now I wish I had really been more present during each moment to fully enjoy and savour them," Klum said.
 
 The model, who has  , 13, Henry, 12,  , 11, and  , eight - believes confidence makes people look 'sexy'. 
 
  "Confidence is sexy. There's something alluring about a person that just seems at ease and comfortable with themselves. It's something we should all strive for."
