Panaji:   matches not involving Goa have been played in front of near empty stands but the performances of ‘star’ players have not gone unnoticed.
 
  Even as the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy loses its stars with each passing year, and also its relevance in an increasingly changing scenario, there is still a flicker of hope for those who grab attention in the tournament.
  
  The All India Football Federation (AIFF) for one is keeping an eagle eye over the performers with two   watching most of the matches at Bambolim and Vasco, while Indian Super League (ISL) franchises too have sat among the crowd and watched teams with more than just passing interest.
  
  “I have managed to get scouts on board. They even covered the Inter-University tournament. The idea is to spot talent anywhere. Since I come from the University set-up I know that there are good players. As for the Santosh Trophy, it’s our national tournament and there is a great chance that we may spot someone,” said  , AIFF’s director of scouting.
  
  In Goa, former India juniors coach   and former goalkeeper   have both been circling probable names who can do duty for India, most notably at the AFC U-23 Championship qualifier. India have been drawn alongside Qatar, Syria and Turkmenistan in Group C and the AIFF are keen to provide the National coach with a bigger pool of players to choose from.
  
  According to sources, two players each from Goa, Kerala and Bengal have caught the eye of selectors while a couple of players from Mizoram are also being considered.
  
  The National scouts are not the only ones keeping tabs on players at the Santosh Trophy.
  
  Kerala Blasters CEO Varun Tripuraneni has made it clear that they are identifying young local stars from the team playing in the Santosh Trophy, while other franchises like FC Goa and Mumbai City FC have also made their presence felt during matches.
