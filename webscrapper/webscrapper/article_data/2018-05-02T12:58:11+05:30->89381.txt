MADURAI: Proper maintenance of an electric pole, be it erected by a private person on private land, is the bounden duty of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation ( ), the Madurai bench of the Madras high court held while ordering it to pay 7 lakh as compensation to the legal heirs of a woman who got electrocuted. 

 Justice M S   passed the order on the petition filed by   of Madurai whose wife   died on July 17, 2016. The petitioner's wife was walking on the road in her locality when she slipped and lost her balance. To avoid falling down, she held on to an iron pole erected on the adjoining private land only to suffer electric shock and die the same day. Chellappa filed a case against Tangedco contending that it was liable to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the death of his wife. His side argued that there were two iron pipes through which electric cables from the main post on the main road were taken and the iron pole drew power supply to a religious institution. Thus Tangedco should have ensured that electricity did not pass through the pole during rain.
 
 Countering it, the Tangedco counsel said that the pipeline belonged to a private person and was erected on his land and hence it was not liable to pay compensation. If at all compensation had to be granted, it was the private person who were be held responsible for negligence, the counsel said. However, the judge said that even assuming that the iron pole was erected by a private person on a private land, it would be the duty of the electricity board to ensure that the pole was maintained properly.
