INDORE: A science teacher at a school in   district allegedly forced students of an entire class to slap three classmates for a week, in a bid to bypass the laws against corporal punishment.

 Each of the girls — all class VI students — was slapped around 168 times. The father of one of the victims has filed a police complaint, even as cops aren’t sure whom to arrest and are seeking a legal opinion.
 
 Shockingly, the authorities of the   residential school in   tehsil have condoned the atrocity, calling it a ‘friendly punishment’. “Teachers can’t themselves punish students weak in studies. Thus, Verma made their classmates execute it. The students weren’t hit hard. It was a friendly punishment meant to send the message across,” school principal K Sagar said, adding that a meeting will be held with parents to discuss the issue.
 
 According to the complainant, the three students hadn’t completed their science homework on January 11, which infuriated the teacher  . “Verma ordered each student to slap my daughter twice each day, for the next six days,” the complaint stated.
 
 The complainant claimed that his daughter hadn’t done the homework as she was ill. “The assault has caused her immense mental and physical trauma. She is now terrified of going to school,” he stated.
 
 Cops are in a dilemma following the complaint and are yet to register a case. “We are seeking a legal opinion about who could be regarded as accused, the students who acted on behalf of the teacher or the teacher himself,” said Thandla SHO Sher Singh  , adding, “The students have confirmed that they had indeed slapped the victims as ordered by Verma.”
 
 The daughter of the complainant was sent for a medical examination. No injuries were, however, reported, said Baghel. The probe revealed that she was slapped only one day and not for six days, the SHO added.
