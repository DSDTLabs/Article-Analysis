Actor   has issued a legal notice to PETA, demanding an apology for the recent statements of one of its members.   had accused Suriya of using the   issue for the publicity of his upcoming movie 'S3' directed by Hari. 

 Suriya's lawyer, in his notice, claimed that Suriya had reiterated his commitment and support to Jallikattu on several occasions in the past as well as opposed to what was being claimed by  , who had said, "It's no coincidence that Suriya decided to speak only when his film S3 is about to release. During illegal jallikattu events recently held, both bulls and humans have lost their lives. To use a cruel spectacle that routinely causes injuries and death, and which has been condemned as illegal by the highest court in our country for movie publicity is in extremely poor taste."
 
 Suriya's lawyer, through the notice, asked PETA to tender an unconditional apology in writing to his client and also release a copy of it to the media within a period of 7 days from the time of receiving the notice. Failure to tender an apology would result in Suriya initiating appropriate legal proceedings against PETA, the notice said.
