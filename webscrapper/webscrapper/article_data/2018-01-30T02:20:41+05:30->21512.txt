NEW DELHI: Two days after a   woman was brutally   in her house in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, the accused was arrested from Jahangirpuri while packing his bags to flee the city.

 The accused, Budhai, told police that he got angry when she scolded him and asked him to do his work properly. He said that he wanted to behead her, but rushed out after hearing footsteps approaching the house.
 
 On January 26, the body of Rajrani Grover was found with the neck slit. “The house was ransacked and jewellery was also missing. A probe revealed that the woman had called two plumbers to repair the water motor,” said DCP (northwest) Aslam Khan.
 
 When the two plumbers were interrogated, it was found that a third person pretending to be a plumber and electrician had joined them. CCTV footage of the locality and nearby areas was scrutinised and cops zeroed in on the suspect. The video also showed him sharpening his weapon before entering the house.
 
 “Around 15 teams were formed for conducting a door-to-door survey to find out if the suspect was known to anybody in the area,” Khan said. Cops finally managed to identify him after visited the labour chowk where they found that he was a rickshawpuller.
 
 Budhai told police that he had been roaming in the locality to commit theft. He soon saw the two plumbers and decided to join them. The plumbers thought that he had been hired by the woman and didn’t question him.
 
 The accused found out that the woman stayed alone and felt that she could be an easy target. Though he had a little plumbing experience, he didn’t fix something properly for which he was reprimanded by the woman. He then went out, sharpened his weapon and returned to kill her.
 
 He took her to a room and asked her to hand over the valuables. When she resisted and started screaming for help, he slit her throat. He fled after stealing two pairs of earrings, gold bangles, a necklace, some cash and her cellphone, police said.
