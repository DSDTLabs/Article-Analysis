KANPUR: Road caved in and were damaged at many places after the   from Tuesday night to   in the city. 

 Several prominent roads got submerged and many caved in afterwards. Most of the roads, which were recently constructed on instructions of chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi of making roads pothole free by June 15 this year, have also been damaged at many places.
 
 A major portion of a prominent road connecting Kanpur Central to Mall road also caved in on Wednesday night. As this road connects railway station to important roads of the city including Cantt, Mall road and Lal Bangla, commuters had a tough time passing through it. Some locals placed tree branches and bricks near the damaged portion of the road to prevent any accidents.
 
 Locals alleged that it was the poor construction responsible for the damage on the first day of the rainfall. "This road was constructed a couple of weeks ago and its condition today reveals the below standard work of the civic authorities," said Saroj Kumar a local of the area.
 
 Similarly, a road in Tilak Nagar near Thandi Pulia, connecting road to Phoolbagh in Civil Lines near Reserve Bank of India, VIP road, Deep Cinema in Saket Nagar and a portion of road in Naubasta road heading towards Galla Godam also caved in on Wednesday night.
 
 Besides, many roads turned slippery after the rainfall making it difficult for people. The worst condition was witnessed near Ganga Barrage where a major connecting road to Barrageand people had to take long alternative routes.
 
 When TOI, on Thursday, took stock of the situation in the city it was found that nothing has been done so far to provide any relief. However, leveling of a road which had caved in at Ashok Nagar trisection on 80 ft road on Saturday night was done by the KMC on Thursday.
