Colva: Former chairperson of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) Savio Coutinho, on Saturday claimed that a room built in ward 24 to store garbage bins, has an air-conditioner and premium flooring tiles, too. The Shadow Council, of which Coutinho is the convener, held a press conference at the site to condemn “the gross misuse of taxpayers’ money”. “After receiving information from the MMC in reply to a query under the RTI Act, we began inspecting the sites mentioned on a list. Although we noticed many irregularities at different sites, the most prominent one was of this room. Upon inquiry with the people living in its vicinity, we learnt it was being used for private purposes. We were also told that the fact was brought to the notice of the civic body, but no action was initiated,” Coutinho said. The Shadow Council said it subsequently brought the matter to the notice of the new chief officer, Agnelo Fernandes, who assured that a police complaint would be filed. MMC chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai, told STOI she learnt of the issue on Friday, following which she directed the municipal engineer to submit a report immediately. “I will certainly look into it on Monday. If there’s an irregularity, I will inspect the site and take the necessary action,” she said.
