BENGALURU: The simmering differences within   burst into the open once again on Sunday, less than two months after chairman R Seshasayee said that he had received a commitment from the company’s founders that they would keep their differences within the company and not air them through the media.

 The flash point this time was a resolution, which came for voting on March 31, to increase the total compensation of chief operating officer U B   by 35% to Rs 12.5 crore. Most of the promoters of the company, including N R  , abstained on the resolution.
 
 Murthy on Sunday provided an elaborate explanation for why he did not vote for it, with a reference to “current 
  ,” a message once again clearly directed at Seshasayee and the board.
 
 Murthy said the hike went against Infosys’s tradition of fairness in compensation. He said he believed in striving towards reducing differences in compensation and equity in a corporation, and indicated that Rao’s compensation increase has sharpened the differences.
 
 Murthy also said that no previous resolution in the history of the company had received such a low approval. About 24% of the public institutions (including banks, FIIs, insurance companies mutual funds) and 67% of public non-institutions (ADRs, directors, foreign body corporates, HUF, NRI, trusts, foreign nationals) voted against the resolution. However, overall, 67% of the votes polled was in favour.
 
 This abstention is a repeat of a similar one early last year, when the company moved a resolution to increase 
  ’s salary by almost 60% to $11 million. Then too, most of the promoters did not vote for it, but the resolution was passed. More recently, the promoters had expressed serious reservations over the massive severance pay granted to former CFO Rajiv Bansal.
 
 In the former case, the company said it was an effort to move to international standards of compensation and noted that the fixed component of Sikka’s salary had dropped and only the variable pay had been sharply increased and that it was tied to steep performance goals. In the Bansal case, following the internal furore, the board admitted an element of subjectivity had influenced the quantum of severance pay and that it had since then put in place a policy to ensure that there would not be a repeat of it.
 
 Under the new compensation structure, Rao will get a total compensation of Rs 12.5 crore. This includes Rs 4.62 crore in fixed salary, Rs 3.88 crore in variable compensation, and Rs 4 crore as performance-based stock compensation. The RSUs and stock options will vest over a four year period. In the 2016 fiscal, Rao took home Rs 9.28 crore.
 
 
 
 
 I have lots of affection for Pravin. Let me state you the facts.
 
 I recruited Pravin in 1985 and had nurtured him throughout my stay at Infosys since then.
 
 He had been sidelined. He was not even a member of the   at Infosys in 2013 when I came back. Kris (Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder), Shibu (S D Shibulal, co-founder) and I encouraged him, elevated him to the board, and made him the COO when we recruited Vishal as the CEO. So, this abstention has nothing to do with Pravin.
 
 Those of us who have always stood for fairness in compensation and practiced it, right from the day Infosys was founded, will have to demonstrate it when needed. This is a time when it is needed. Nothing more and nothing less.
 
 I believe in striving towards reducing differences in compensation and equity in a corporation. You may not know that my Infosys salary at the time of the founding of Infosys was just 10% of my salary in my previous job. I ensured that my younger, co-founder colleagues got 20% higher salary over their salaries in their previous job even though I was 7 levels above them in my previous job and was 11 years older than them. I gave them huge equity compensation the like of which has never been replicated in this world. So, this abstention comes from somebody who has walked the talk.
 
 I have always felt that every senior management person of an Indian corporation has to show self-restraint in his or her compensation and perquisites. He or she has to fight for maintaining a reasonable ratio between the lowest salary and the highest salary in a corporation in a poor country like India. The board has to create a climate of opinion for such a fairness by their actions.
 
 This is necessary if we have to make compassionate capitalism acceptable to a majority of Indians who are poor. Without compassionate capitalism, this country cannot create jobs and solve the problem of poverty.
 
 Experts tell me that capitalism may come to an end in the not-so-distant future if the current corporate leaders do not heed this advice in India.
 
 Further, giving nearly 60% to 70% increase in compensation for a top level person (even including performance-based variable pay) when the compensation for most of the employees in the company was increased by just 6% to 8% is, in my opinion, not proper. This is grossly unfair to the majority of the Infosys employees including project managers, delivery managers, analysts, programmers, sales people in the field, entry level engineers, clerks and office boys who are toiling hard to make the company better. The impact of such a decision will likely erode the trust and faith of the employees in the management and the board.
 
 With what conscience can a decent person like Pravin (a man schooled in Infosys values for over 30 years) tell his juniors that they should work hard and make sacrifice to reduce cost and protect margin? I have got so many mails from these people asking whether this resolution is fair. No previous resolution in the history of the company has received such a low approval.
 
 Finally, given the current poor governance standards at Infosys, let us also remember that these targets for variable pay may not be adhered to if the board wants to favour a top management person.”
