PATNA: The office-bearers of Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) on Sunday denied any embezzlement of funds as alleged in an FIR lodged with the Secretariat police station last month.   In an FIR lodged by former BCA treasurer Ram Kumar, BCA secretary Ravi Shankar Prasad Singh and its former secretary Ajay Narayan Sharma have been accused of misappropriating Rs50 lakh given to the association by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2009. It is also alleged that equipment worth Rs65 lakh given to BCA by the BCCI had been sold off.    The office-bearers showed newsmen some equipment which were alleged to be missing as per the FIR.    Denying all accusations, Singh said the FIR was filed to disrupt the smooth functioning of BCA. “We have complete audit report of the account, photographs of the equipment as well as a signed letter dated April 6, 2017 from the then working president and Bihar’s finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui, which prove that the account was opened with the approval of the association. Not only this, the BCCI got our account audited by Deloitte in December 2016 and no discrepancy was detected,” Singh added.    “The equipment was kept with BCA member Ramashenkar Prasad at Gopalganj for safety reasons,” said Dr D P Tripathi of the BCA media committee. He said the equipment could not be left abandoned at the Moinul Haq Stadium as the government had not allotted them a space there. “As far as the account is concerned, Ram Kumar himself managed it when he was the treasurer,” Tripathi added.    According to Tripathi, Ram Kumar made the allegations only after he was removed from the association.    BCA president Gopal Bohra said, “The accusations are false and would not derail the working of the association.”    When contacted, Secretariat police station SHO Rajesh Kumar Dubey, who is conducting the probe, said, “The case is still under investigation.”
