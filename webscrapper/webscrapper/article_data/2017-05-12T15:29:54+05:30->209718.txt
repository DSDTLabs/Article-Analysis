NEW DELHI:   dismissed as rumours the reports that High court had ordered an IT probe into the   case. The party also slammed the ruling   for what it called was political vendetta.

  spokesman randeep Surjewala said, "Young Indian had raised certain fundamental jurisdictional issues challenging authority of   authorities. Delhi High Court directed Income Tax authorities to decide all the issues raised in petition before Delhi High Court. Being satisfied with it, Abhishek Singhvi, Advocate for Young Indian, has himself withdrawn the petition."
 
 Surjewala said Young Indian was a 'not for profit' company that only runs the 'National Herald ' paper which is the last vestige of freedom movement. "No one can withdraw a single rupee of profit, salary or dividend from it or benefit from it in any manner as per the Companies Act," he added.
 
 congress said that bjp was driven by malice in making allegations against young indian to target the Gandhi family but "it will not deter us from upholding our bounden duty to the Nation."
