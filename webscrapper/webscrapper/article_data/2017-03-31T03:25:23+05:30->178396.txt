New Delhi: Delhiites suffered the double-whammy of a freakishly warm   followed by a hot day on Thursday, with both the maximum and minimum   setting records for the month of March.

 The city got another taste of what is forecast to be a long and hot summer with the maximum temperature rising to 38.3 degrees Celsius, highest seen in the month since 2010.
 
 The rise in the minimum temperature was sharper. At 23.7 degrees C, Thursday’s minimum touched a level not seen in the city in March this century. TOI could access temperature records only from year 2000.
 
 Both the maximum and minimum temperatures were six degrees above normal, showing just how much the current conditions are hotter than usual for this time of the year. In fact, if the maximum were to touch 40 degrees C, the capital’s weather will meet IMD’s criteria for both heat wave and ‘warm night’ conditions.
 
 While March is a transition month for weather in north India, this year the change was much sharper than usual. For instance, the minimum temperature on Holi day (March 13) was 9 degrees C, the lowest for the month in 14 years.
 
 Meteorologists said the current hot conditions are being caused by a combination of factors, with an approaching western disturbance — which brings in warmer winds from the south and east — adding to the heat being pumped into the region by an air flow pattern called an anti-cyclone. 
 
 There is, however, a possibility of Delhiites getting relief from heat early next week.
 
 “Day temperatures in Delhi and NCR will remain in the 38-39 degrees range till April 4. Thereafter, the maximum will decrease a bit. There’s a possibility of a dust storm or a thunder storm at isolated places in the region on the evening of April 4 or the following day,” said Ravinder Vishen, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.
