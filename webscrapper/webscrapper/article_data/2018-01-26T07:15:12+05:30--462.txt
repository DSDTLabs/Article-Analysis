NEW DELHI: In a signal to fringe elements like   as also saffron leaders opposing the film ‘Padmaavat’, RSS national spokesperson Manmohan   on Thursday said violence could not be condoned while “democratic means of protests” could be used to express opposition. 

 “The censor board has cleared ‘Padmaavat’. If anyone has a difference of opinion about the film, there are democratic means of protest... violence cannot be condoned,” Vaidya, who is Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh of RSS, said. He added that this was the view of the organisation. Vaidya’s comments were in contrast to RSS functionary from Rajasthan Bhagwati Prakash’s remarks. 
 
 Prakash, RSS’s northwest regional sanghchalak, on Wednesday urged people and cinema owners to refrain from watching and screening  , describing the controversial film as an attempt to hurt public sentiments and disturb social harmony. Vaidya, however, downplayed the comment, indicating that it did not reflect the RSS position. 
 
 “Our view is that violence cannot be a means of protest. In a democracy, there are other peaceful means that can be used to register protests,” he said. Interestingly, another senior RSS functionary had earlier this week said the movie should be released only after making necessary changes.
