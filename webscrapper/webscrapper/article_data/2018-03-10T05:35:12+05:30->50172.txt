HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad HC on Friday issued notice to Telangana Chief Secretary   in a contempt case and directed him to appear before the court to explain the reason of his failure to implement court order of setting up   Farmers Debt Relief Commission. 

 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice J Uma Devi was hearing a contempt plea filed by BJP leader  , who charged the CS with showing scant regard towards court orders. The bench too found that the   was dodging the issue. It did not agree with the reply given by Telangana State counsel   that they have to consult the HC for appointing a retired HC judge as the chairman of the commission. 
 
 The bench said the State gave the same reply in last hearing and so far HC has not been consulted. Refusing to accord more time, the bench summoned the CS and posted the case to 4 weeks. As the notice given to CS is a form I notice that mandates physical presence of the recipient before the court under contempt of courts Act, Joshi has to be physically present before the court.
