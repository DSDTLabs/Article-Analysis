MELBOURNE: She isn't saying. She doesn't need to, Angelique  's smile is catching her eyes. The 30-year-old, former No.1 and two-time Grand Slam champion, is feeling the joy. Again.

 Kerber, ranked 22, her lowest year-end finish since ending at No. 32 in 2011, shut out big-hitting American   6-1, 6-2 in 51 minutes to make the last four. On Thursday, she'll play world No.1 Simona  , who beat Czech Karolina   6-3, 6-2, for a place in the final.
 
 Kerber, who has brushed aside attempts to understand what happened last year, when she was without a title, her ranking dropping outside the top-20, said she rather focus on the now.
 
 "I try to enjoy myself again on court. I know that I was working hard in the offseason, and I know that I can play good matches, win close matches also," the German, who appeared to be just going through the motions last year, said.
 
 "I try to finding the feeling back that I had in 2016 and just enjoying my time. I mean, on and off court. For me it's really important to just have a good time off court."
 
 Kerber said her confidence is back. "I have a lot of confidence and belief in my game already, because I start the year good, played good in Perth, and I won Sydney. That gives me a lot of confidence coming here."
 
 "I will never forget the memories I had in 2016 here, so that's why I feel so good. And I know all the places in Melbourne where I can go for, let's say, a coffee or just when I have a day off."
 
 Kerber said her game was work in progress, while she relies on her consistency, she is now trying to attack.
