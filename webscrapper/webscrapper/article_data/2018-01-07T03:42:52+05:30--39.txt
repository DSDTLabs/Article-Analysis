NEW DELHI: On a day an IED blast claimed the lives of four policemen in J&K,   alleged that the   government has “singularly failed” to protect the country’s security personnel. 

 The opposition party also questioned the recent covert meeting of the NSAs of India and Pakistan. Congress spokesman Anand   said that not a day goes without attacks on  , paramilitary and police men and all that the government has to offer are “boastful” statements and tall claims. 
 
 “Accountability has to be established as to why the government has failed despite the boastful statements of the Prime Minister and of his ministers about action across the border,” Sharma said. 
 
 He added, “This government has singularly failed to reassure the country of its ability to protect defence establishments and personnel.” “We are completely in the dark as to what was discussed during the recent meeting between NSA Doval and his Pakistani counterpart,” Sharma said. 
 
 He added, “What has been the outcome? Outcome has only been more attacks, more deaths, and more killings of defence personnel.” Sharma said the government must answer and not continue with its habit of making claims about some strike.
