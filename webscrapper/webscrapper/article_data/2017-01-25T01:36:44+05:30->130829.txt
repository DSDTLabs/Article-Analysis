MUMBAI:   across India can now only take three shots at cracking the  , a cap introduced to discourage thousands of ‘Munnabhais’ who keep trying their luck at the medical entrance test. Also, now the candidates must be below 25 years of age if they want to take the  . 

 During a University Grants Commission meeting in Delhi on Tuesday, it was decided that the minimum age for   will be 17 and the maximum 25. The cap on age for students from the reserved category will be 30. Till date, there has neither been a maximum age defined to take the NEET nor a limit on the number of attempts. 
 
 “This is a good decision,” said Dr Pravin Shingare, director of the directorate of medical education and research. “When they don’t make the cut, some students join a BSc college and then every year, keep taking the medical embrace test,” he added. In fact, the rule will also bar faculty of coaching classes who perpetually take the entrance test to understand the altering pattern of the exam. The NEET information brochures that contain this information and will be disbursed soon. 
 
 Two years ago, the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT) had to be conducted again after it was found that 90 answers had been transmitted to the candidates during the examination in consideration of Rs 15 lakh-Rs 20 lakh. The AIPMT 2015 scandal had at least 45 beneficiaries who were supplied with special vests fitted with SIM card and a bluetooth device to facilitate transmission of answer keys. “We often find that that coaching classes field candidates and sometimes that leads to fraud and cheating,” said an expert. 
 
 This cap on age and attempts will force candidates to focus on the field where their capability and passion lie, said principals.
