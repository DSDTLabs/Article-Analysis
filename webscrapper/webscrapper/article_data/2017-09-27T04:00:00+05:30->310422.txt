Vadodara: Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) finished razing of Pathik Bhavan in the station area on Tuesday morning. The civic body has now started major operations to clean the area by removing debris there.

 According to sources, the razing drive was a daunting task and at times two or even three chained excavators were used for razing the structure. The drive passed off smoothly barring an incident of one of the excavators turning over. One excavator that developed a snag was repaired at the site itself by a team of mechanics of the VMC and the contractor who provided the machines.
 
 The civic body had started razing the structure that had nine shops on its ground floor and a guesthouse on three floors above it. The structure was in the possession of the district panchayat. It was transferred to the VMC recently by the state government.
 
 With the VMCâ€™s plea of allowing the demolition of the structure being allowed by high court, the civic body began the razing drive at around 10pm. Senior officials of the civic body camped at the site till early on Tuesday morning when the drive was nearly over. Personnel of fire brigade, Vadodara Gas Ltd and others remained present at the site. Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd had already disconnected power supply to the building. VMC commissioner Vinod Rao said the debris would be removed from the site by Wednesday. The civic body had on Tuesday afternoon cleared the road leading to the bus depot from the railway station. The road was closed since Wednesday night for the razing drive as a corner of the Pathik Bhavan was on its side and the space was also to be used for the demolition.
