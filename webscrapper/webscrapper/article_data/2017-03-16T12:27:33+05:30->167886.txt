MUMBAI: Minutes after  's surprise resignation as independent chairman of the  , speculation started doing rounds over who would replace him.

 The ICC's eligibility criteria to contest for the post of the independent chairman is as follows: To be eligible for election as chairman, such person must be either a current or former director and that he may not may not (i) hold any office under, or perform any executive or operational duties for, any cricket authority; or (ii) hold any office under, or perform any executive or operational duties for, any state, association or member (or similar) of any cricket authority .“ Further, candidates can only be nominated by a fellow ICC director who, in turn, will be allowed to provide no more than one nominee. Any nominee with the support of at least two Full Member ICC directors will be put forward as a candidate.
 
 Several individuals are eligible to be nominated for the post. Among them is   ­ the man who was forced to leave BCCI by the Supreme Court (SC) -should he resign as president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.
 
 “He likes comebacks. This will be his greatest,“ an official close to Srinivasan told TOI.
 
 However, the man himself would prefer to wait till the Supreme Court hears the batch of petitions filed by BCCI and various state bodies on March 20.
 
 The obvious roadblock in front of Srinivasan is the stance the SC-appointed   will take in case Srini decides to throw his hat in the ring.
 
 “If Srini resigns from TNCA, he can contest. If BCCI doesn't nominate him, another full member director can. The question here is not whether he will or he won't contest or who'll nominate him, a senior ex-functionary of the BCCI said. “It's about whether the court or the CoA will find wisdom in supporting the very individual who they forced out of BCCI administration.“
