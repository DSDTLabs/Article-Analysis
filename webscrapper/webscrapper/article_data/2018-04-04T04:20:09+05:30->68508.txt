MUMBAI: Illegal sand mining that has resulted in endangering the safety of railway bridges, including the   bridge, and even disappearance of an island has come under the scanner of the Bombay high court. A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Riyaz Chagla will on Wednesday decide on an application filed by Julie Kharbhumi Labharthi Sekhari Sanstha on behalf of farmers in Jhaw island against illegal sand mining in the area. 

 The application, filed through their lawyers   and Kranti L C, claims that satellite images of Vaitarna river and creek areas between 2004 and 2017 show sand banks and even an island has disappeared because of the use of suction pumps to excavate sand. 
 
 The safety of Vaitarna and   that connect Mumbai to north India are in danger because of the sand mining activities, the plea claimed. 
 
 As per minutes of the meeting between the petitioners and authorities, measures have been suggested, including destroying the landing sites where sand is offloaded and installing girders in the creek area under Shorgaon and Kasrali railway bridges, to prevent use of that area as navigation channels for boats with suction pump machinery. 
 
 The petitioners also suggested that the sand seized should not be auctioned but used to restore areas destroyed by illegal sand mining.
