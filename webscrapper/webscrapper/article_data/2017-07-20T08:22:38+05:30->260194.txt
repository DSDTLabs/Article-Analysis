VADODARA: Girl students are facing a severe space crunch at M S University’s   as the number of students who have applied for admission this year have outnumbered vacancies available at the hostel campus. 

 Such is the crisis at the four girls hostels that students are forced to sleep in common rooms and even occupy study rooms at the four units of the hostel campus. While a students’ group made a representation regarding this at Faculty of Arts on Wednesday, officials of Halls of Residence too admitted that the girls’ hostels presently have 125 more students. 
 
 “After the old students graduated, presently, we have 450 vacancies at the four hostels. But since the admissions in hostels are done online and new girls have taken admission in various faculties, the numbers of those seeking admission in hostels has increased manifold,” said Vijay Parmar, chief warden of Halls of Residence. 
 
 He said that presently all the girls who are seeking temporary accommodation are being allowed to use hostel premises on humanitarian grounds. 
 
 “Once the faculties send us the list of students based on their merit and the seats allocated to them based on their student strength, we will ask the other girls to make alternate arrangements,” he said. Ironically, the samras hostel campus which has been constructed by the state government on MSU’s land at   campus inside   premises presently has nearly 1,000 seats vacant for girl students. 
 
 But sources suggest that because of lack of awareness or some unknown reasons, girl students of   are not applying to get admission in this samras hostel where food and accommodation is available for free to girls.
