PANCHAKULA:   here under a special campaign to stop underage children from driving vehicles have issued more than   as well as of their parents in the past 10 days of the campaign. The drive will continue till May 31. 

 According to the traffic cops, they had put up special nakas near schools, Sector 5, Mauli Jagran, Rajiv Colony, Majri chowk and Sector 2 college to check children under 18 years of age driving vehicles. During the drive on Thursday, cops impounded 12 vehicles driven by minor children without any paper of the vehicle while five were issued challans for not having a driving licence. Traffic officials said that they were issuing challans not only to children but also their parents to prevent them from giving their vehicles to their minor children again.
 
 Interestingly, traffic police is getting good response from parents for issuing challans to their minor children for driving vehicles. Traffic inspector and SHO   said that we used to call parents of all those challaned and used to counsel them to not give vehicles for driving to their minor children. He added that during counselling mostly parents seemed appreciative of the fact that their children who didn't listen to them were being pulled up by traffic cops. The SHO further said that, "Our main purpose is to make parents and their children understand about the pros and cons of driving vehicle after they get matured and getting a driving licence. We are getting good response and support from the parents of these children. Most of the children who were issued challans later told me that they had started using public transport instead of driving their own vehicles." 
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (traffic)   said that, "Counselling of minor children as well as of the parents is our key motive and teams are working on to make it beneficial for the public."
