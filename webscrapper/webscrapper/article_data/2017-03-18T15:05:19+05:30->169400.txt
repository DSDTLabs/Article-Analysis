KOLKATA: There is now a two-week break in the   and   coach   is hoping to utilise the time to re-energise the players before the green and maroons resume their campaign with a match against   at home on April 1. Mohun Bagan are currently third in the table with 23 points from 12 matches while   are in the top position with 30 points from 14 games.   occupy the second spot on the table with 27 points from 14 encounters.

 Mohun Bagan have given their players a break for a few days and will resume their training sessions from March 22. Sanjoy Sen will not have all the players at his disposal as few of them have joined the Indian national team while   has gone to Haiti for national-team duty.
 
 "We have to make a fresh start when the I-League resumes and I hope this break will help the players. It will be very important for us to win the match against Bengaluru FC as that will give us confidence going into the   against East Bengal (on April 9 in Siliguri)," said Sanjoy Sen, adding, "All the three teams --- Mohun Bagan, Aizawl FC and East Bengal --- are in contention for the title. This season, we will be chasing for the title from behind and let us see if we can do it. I have been in charge of Mohun Bagan in the last three seasons and I feel that this has been the toughest I-League so far."
