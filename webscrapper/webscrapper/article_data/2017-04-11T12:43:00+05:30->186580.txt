RAJKOT: The famous ‘fire-paan’ of Rajkot has come under the scanner of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation’s health department on Monday. The health officials raided various places including fire-paan famed Galaxy   Shop on 150feet-Ring Road and recovered the thinner, which was allegedly used to create flame on the paan.

 According to   officials, they have recovered a bottle of thinner, which is meant only for industrial use from the shop. 
 
 The shop had come into limelight last year when it launched ‘fire-paan’ where in the owner used ‘unknown’ substance to create flame on paan while customers ate it. The shop-owner was secretive about the material used to create flame on the paan telling that it is his ‘formula’. But RMC’s raids and subsequent recovery of thinner reportedly exposed the use of deadly chemical by the owner to make the fire-paan.
 
 According to RMC officials, they also carried out raids at two other paan shops and destroyed around 25kg of unhygenic materials used in making the paan.
 
 The civic body also took samples of various items for quality testing and issued notice to the shop-owners.
