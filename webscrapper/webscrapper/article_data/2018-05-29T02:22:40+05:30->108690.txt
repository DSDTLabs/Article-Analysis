NEW DELHI: External affairs minister   on Monday reiterated that there was no change in the status quo at the   2017 faceoff site as she described as unprecedented PM  's recent informal summit with Chinese President  . 

 
 “As far as the informal summit is concerned, this is a new dialogue mechanism. It has never been adopted before anywhere in the world,” said Swaraj. “When I met foreign minister Wang Yi, I said that the two leaders (Xi and Modi) should not be held down to an agenda. He agreed because they also did not want bilateral contentious issues to come in this summit,” she added. 
 
 Swaraj said the summit was meant to reduce friction between the two countries, improve common understanding of global issues and increase mutual trust. “All three objectives have been met. That’s why we term it successful,” she said, adding that the two leaders were now in a position to call up each other directly in case of any emergency. Swaraj also said that contrary to what had been suggested there was no change at the Doklam face-off site in Bhutan. 
 
 “People did not think that the issue could be resolved without a war but now the entire international community appreciates India for successfully handling the situation through diplomacy and dialogue,” she said. Swaraj also denied that Chinese authorities had prevented devotees from taking a dip in the Mansarovar lake. “There is always a designated place where you can take a bath, you cannot take a dip anywhere in the river,” she said.
