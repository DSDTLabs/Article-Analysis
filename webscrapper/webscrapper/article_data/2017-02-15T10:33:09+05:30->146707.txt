BENGALURU: What are the legal options before V K  ,   and  , whose conviction by the trial court in a disproportionate assets case was upheld by the  ?
Very few, is the opinion of legal experts because the Supreme Court has restored the verdict of the trial court with very strong observations of its own relating to corruption.
 
 Sasikala and the two co-accused have to surrender before the special trial court to prove they are law-abiding citizens, undergo some portion of the sentence and show good conduct before they are eligible for any lenience, legal experts said.
 
 H S Chandramouli, former state public prosecutor of Karnataka, said Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Ilavarasi can either file a review petition before the Supreme Court, mentioning any legal flaws they have found in the verdict.
 
 Chandramouli said they could approach the Karnataka government seeking reduction in the four-year imprisonment term awarded to them under Section 431 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but acceding to the request is the prerogative of the state. Senior counsel S P Shankar also felt that the options before Sasikala were extremely limited. “They can file a review petition but its scope is limited.Regarding set-off (reduction in sentence) available under Section 431, this case is not fit for that benefit,“ he said.
 
 The five-page supplementary judgement written by Justice  , one of the judges on the two-judge SC bench that pronounced the verdict, will make things difficult in acceding to any plea for lenience. In his order, the judge observed, “ Any interpretation of the provisions of such law has to be essentially purposive, in furtherance of its mission and not in retrogression thereof. Innovative nuances of evidential inadequacies, processual infirmities and interpretational subtleties, artfully advanced in defence, otherwise intangible and inconsequential, ought to be conscientiously cast aside with moral maturity and singular sensitivity to uphold the statutory sanctity , lest the coveted cause of justice is a casualty.“
