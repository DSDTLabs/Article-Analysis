SHIMLA: In a major relief to the state government, the   high court has allowed it to frame a policy to regularise encroachments on government and forest land. A division bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   in an order said that it was the prerogative of the state to make laws and policy.

 The division bench in its order issued on Monday observed that the court had not passed any direction on this PIL, whereby the state had been restrained from making any legislation or policy. “Thus, we deem it proper to dispose of this application by providing that the state may proceed with the policy but it should not be construed that we have upheld the legality and validity of the proposed policy. If the policy is made, its validity and legality can be tested at any time, if questioned,” it added.
 
 The state government had submitted before the court that it was planning to bring a policy to regularise the encroachment on forest and government land upto five bighas on humanitarian ground. It had also submitted that the draft of the policy had been framed under a relevant act, which said that the policy would cover beneficiaries prior to August 28, 2015. 
 
 It said possession in rural areas would be given to the maximum extent of 5 bighas in such a manner that own land of the person and the land conferred on beneficiaries does not exceed 10 bighas, provided that the remaining land in possession was vacated.
