PATNA: More than 50 old students went down memory lane at the 15th alumnae meet of   (MMC) organized on Saturday. Clad in pink saris and matching jewellery, the alumnae shared bittersweet memories of college life and roamed around from one classroom to another.

 Prominent former students like littérateur Usha Kiran Khan, National Commission for Women member Sushma Sahu, Patna high court’s former judge Justice Rekha Kumari, state assembly’s former member Usha Vidyarthi and Patna University pro-VC Dolly Sinha attended the event.
 
 Addressing the meet, MMC principal Shashi Sharma said the college was like a “banyan tree”, it flourished and grew only because its branches were connected to their root.
 
 Sharing her two-year experience at the college, Usha Kiran Khan of the 1958-60 Intermediate batch recalled, “I still remember my friends and teachers who motivated me to do something big in life and never look back. I have visited MMC after a long time.”
 
 Alumna Rita Thakur performed a solo dance which left the audience spellbound. Some former students were happy to meet old friends after years while others shared their experiences with the new students.
 
 Various fun activities like lucky stars, musical chairs and number games were also organized on the occasion. The programme ended with dinner in the evening.
