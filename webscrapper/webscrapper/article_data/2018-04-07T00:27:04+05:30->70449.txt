Kanyakumari: The district police have denied permission to organise the mass protest that was planned by the Kanyakumari International Container Transhipment Terminal Struggle Committee (ICTTSC) in front of the Kanyakumari district collectorate on Saturday. Following the development, the committee has announced that they would instead organise the protest at the proposed site for the port near Kovalam and Manakudi. Struggle committee members said that more than 10 representatives were called to the office of the superintendent of police around 6 pm on Thursday to discuss about the protests. In the discussions they were asked about the expected strength and arrangements made by them. They were also briefed on the dos and don’ts to ensure peaceful protests without affecting the public. “But around 11 pm on Thursday we were handed over a letter stating that the permission was denied. Due to the on-going Cauvery Management Board protests, police will not be able to handle the expected strength,” coordinate of the committee R S Parthasarathy said. Members of the struggle committee said that they would abide by the directions and that they would organise the protest near the collectorate on a later date. However they will picket the seashore and organise a big protest on Saturday. BJP too which had announced a bandh on Saturday to counter the anti-port protests has now announced that the bandh will not be organised. Superintendent of Police (SP) of Kanyakumari District N Shreenath told TOI that due to these unexpected developments more than 1,000 policemen and officers from the district and 800 police personnel and officers from the other districts in south zone – including Madurai, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin – have been deployed for security arrangements. “All possible efforts have been taken to maintain law and order. Action will be taken against those taking the law in their hand,” he added.
