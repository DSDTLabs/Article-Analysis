MUMBAI: For the first time since the lid was blown off the dubious investment scheme, an FIR has been filed with Mumbai police against four directors of the   (RTSC) Ltd. The city's economic offences wing (EOW) has begun investigating the Rs 70 lakh cheating case. Within a week of the FIR being filed, over 200 other investors have approached the police. Police estimate the fraud could run into several crores. 

 Police said the accused had floated several schemes. "The investment plans started at Rs1,000 per month. Since the amount was low, it attracted investors in bulk," said an officer.
 
 In this case, the complainant is a manager at a wine shop, who also acted as an agent for the firm. He has told the police he not only invested his savings, but he also roped in relatives and clients who parted with their hard-earned money, adding up to Rs70 lakh totally 
 
 Another 65-year-old victim has told police he lost Rs35 lakh. "He has told us he did not receive any benefits and that the monthly interest was also irregular. He told us he was given a cheque on maturity, but it bounced when deposited," added the officer.
 
 In August 2015, the   (Sebi) had imposed a four-year ban on the firm and its four directors for illegally raising over Rs 2,656 crore under the garb of 'time share' holiday plans. The market regulator had directed the company to refund the money along with promised returns to the investors. 
 
 The complaint was first registered at a police station in central Mumbai and later transferred to the EOW.
 
 The EOW has carried out searches at six places in the city and booked the accused under various sections of the   and the stringent   Protection of Interest of Depositors' Act.
