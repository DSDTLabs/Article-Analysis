Trichy: BHEL   will be adding two new products in its portfolio, namely de-NOx system for thermal power plants to bring down the pollution level and coal gasification technology to produce methanol, said, R  , executive director, BHEL, Trichy during an event organised as a part of productivity week at BHEL on Monday.

 Rajamanohar said that as a part of their diversification measure, BHEL has planned to work on establishing coal gasification technology. He said that for the first time in the country, BHEL Trichy would be establishing and demonstrating the technology of converting high ash coal to methanol through gasification and chemical transformation technology with the backing up from NITI Aayog.
 
 BHEL sources said that, through the technology, high ash coal can be converted into methanol and be used as alternate fuel. Discussions were also made with prospective collaborators for technology transfer to manufacture of de-NOx systems which would bring down the emission of nitrogen oxides in power plants.
 
 BHEL sources said that the component which the PSU is likely to produce has to be installed at all the existing and upcoming coal-based thermal power plants as per the revised environment norms by the Union government. Sources said it may take certain time for the Maharatna firms to manufacture de-NOx component and to devise coal gasification technology for commercial purposes. Terming the adoption of new technology and investments in new projects as vital for gaining competitive edge and to lead the manufacturing sector, Rajamanohar called for using the latest technology to improve productivity of BHEL.
