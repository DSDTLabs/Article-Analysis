MUMBAI: Investigators probing the murder of   deputy shakha pramukh Sachin   believe it was planned in advance to the last detail. Officers have questioned several people close to Sawant—including associates, co-workers and neighbours—as they are certain that an insider gave a tip-off to the assailants. Construction contractor   who was riding a motorcycle with Sawant, when the latter was shot, hasn’t been given a clean chit yet.

 
 Multiple police teams and crime branch personnel have been to the crime scene at   in   (east). “Everything about the manner in which the offence was committed indicates it was well planned. The location where Sawant was shot is a distance away from his home. The assailants knew that Sawant's associates from the   would take time to find out about the shooting and reach the location. Lanes open into three directions from the crime spot, giving the killers more avenues to escape,” said an investigator. A firearm was used for the offence as Sawant was strong and would have put up a tough fight if the assailants had wielded knives.
