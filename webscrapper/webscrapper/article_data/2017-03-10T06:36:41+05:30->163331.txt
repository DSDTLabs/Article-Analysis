KOCHI:   and founder of Isha foundation   on Thursday said that the success of a nation depends no more on militancy or even political success but on businesses. 

 "Business succeeds only when it is managed well. Bringing management as a culture for every nation is very important. It is not just managing industry or business. You must learn to manage your street or home and above all your mind. Because, essentially, management means you have to manage meticulously. If you have to manage people, you have to manage in some way all their minds,'' he said.
 
 Sadhguru was addressing the two-day 36th annual national management convention of   (KMA). He was the chief guest at the function.
 
 "The foremost qualification of a person is you must know how to manage your own mind. If you don't know how to manage your mind, how are you going to manage 1,000 people's minds?'' he asked.
 
 He said lot of managers fail simply because our institutes of management and, more fundamentally, levels of education have not cracked the dimension of managing oneself.
 
 "Is is unfortunate that those who are not able to manage themselves and their emotions are trying to manage, say, a thousand people. If mind is not well managed, it cannot manage anything well,'' he said. A nation, Sadhguru said, has three main components that can be broadly classified as territory, natural resources and, most importantly, its people.
 
 "Nation is just an idea. It's not a god-given thing unless the idea burns into people's minds and hearts. Unless you build certain level of identity and pride about your nation you can't built a nation. I think we did not do that well enough,'' he said.
