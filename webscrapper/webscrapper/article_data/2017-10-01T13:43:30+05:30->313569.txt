 On working with the legend who passed away on September 30 due to skin cancer, Khalid says, “Working with him was like working with a master. His work flow is very methodical, we just had to pitch in what we want and he would seamlessly get into the character. I had a character reference of architect Laurie Baker and as it turned out, Tom also liked him.”
 
 Khalid is also all praise to the actor’s discipline. “He was very punctual. We shot in two concise schedules in Kerala, and he finished his bit quickly and left. He was busy with other projects and was also physically weak at that time. But he didn’t let anything affect his role,” says the filmmaker.
