  BCI had given a call to all bar councils and associations to abstain from court work on March 31, as a token of protest against the amendment bill proposed by the  . BCI will meet again on April 8 to decide future action to oppose the bill. 
 
  The council also requested the Bar Council and association members to give representation to MPs in the second week of April, appealing to annul the proposed amendment. 
 
 The Law Commission, according to the BCI webpage, proposed to remove names of advocates from the state rolls if they abstain from court work, irrespective of the reason, and impose a fine of up to Rs 3 lakh, payable to the person aggrieved by the misconduct of any advocate. 
 
  The bill also proposes to define the word 'misconduct' in a way that it would be difficult for advocates to work in a free atmosphere, say advocates. 'Misconduct' as per the Law Commission's definition, provided under the proposed Bill, includes "an act of an advocate whose conduct is found to be in breach of, or non-observance of the standard of professional conduct or etiquette required to be observed... or a forbidden act; or an unlawful behaviour; or disgraceful and dishonourable conduct; or neglect; or not working diligently and criminal breach of trust; or any of his conduct incurring disqualification." 
 
 For any kind of protest or stri ke or abstentions (or default), the advocates would be liable to pay compensation to the litigants. This proposal seeks to usurp the basic democratic right of protest against any form of injustice against lawyers. "As per the request of the  , members of the Mysuru Bar Association held a meeting and decided to abstain from proceedings on Friday," said GV Ramamurthy, president of Mysuru Bar Association.
