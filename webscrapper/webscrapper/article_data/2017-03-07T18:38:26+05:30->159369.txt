PANAJI: Two months after a welder was burned to death in an accident at the construction site of the third Mandovi bridge, the firm constructing the bridge — Larsen & Toubro — has tightened its safety apparatus. A company official associated with the project said that following the accident the company called in its senior security advisors and safety auditors from overseas to take stock of the situation and make necessary changes and added that safety precautions have been increased following the death of the worker.

 “The whole construction site is divided into four sections and every section has its own safety in-charge. We conduct a daily safety meeting before starting work. If there is any violation of rules, the security officer responsible for the site is penalized,” the official said, and added that new purchases, including that of indicators for the construction site have been made. While most workers expressed satisfaction with the improvements made after the accident, some demanded improvement in their living conditions. 
 
 “Safety arrangements here are lax as compared to that of other sites where I have worked. One should see our living conditions near   where most of the workers live. There are no medical arrangements in case of an emergency. The company has kept an ambulance, but nobody knows where the driver is,” a worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, alleged, and added that sometimes workers travel in trucks instead of bus. 
 
 Sarul Sheikh, a 21-year-old native of  , who works as a welder at the third Mandovi bridge, died after suffering 90% burns.
