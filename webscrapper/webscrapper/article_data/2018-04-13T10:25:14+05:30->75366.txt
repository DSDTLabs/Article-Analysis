GOLD COAST: Rifle shooter   rolled back the years to bag the silver medal in women’s 50m rifle prone event at the Belmont   range here on Thursday.

 
 It was her sixth medal at her third  . The 37-year-old Sawant, who won two gold in the 2006 Melbourne Games, added one more to her glittering collection as she finished second behind Singapore’s Martina Lindsay Veloso who set a Games record score of 621.0. Sawant tallied 618.9 to edge Seonaid Mcinrosh of Scotland (618.1).
 
 The 2010 world champion began with a fine series of 102.1 and followed up with a 102.4. She then shot consistently in the next two series before signing off with two high scores of 103.7 and a best of 104.6 in her last detail.
 
 The windy conditions at the range made it difficult for the shooters and only Sawant’s experience pulled her through. “It is very nice to do well here. I’m very happy,” Sawant said. “It was a little windy today but that was not too tough,” she added.
 
 The seasoned campaigner was happy to get the new season off to a bright start and said her goal would be do well in the big meets. “I’m aiming for the Olympic in 2020. But next I’ll go to the Asian Games and then the World Championships in South Korea which will offer a quota place,” a confident Sawant said.
