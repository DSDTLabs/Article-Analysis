GREATER NOIDA: An FIR has been registered against a candidate who had come riding a donkey to file his nomination papers.

 Greater Noida police on Tuesday lodged the FIR on the charge of cruelty towards animals against 36-year old  , who had come to the district collectorate to file his papers for the Dadri seat on Monday. “It is not allowed to bring an animal for nomination like this. We booked him under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act on Tuesday,” Surajpur SHO Anuj Kumar told TOI.
 
 However, Prajapati, who is from the Rashtriya Naujawan Party, called it “harassment”, claiming that riding on donkeys was commonplace for the potter community, which he belongs to, and whose plight he had sought to highlight. “I belong to Roza Jalalpur village of Bisrakh. Many people of my community use donkeys for loading and unloading stuff at the brick kilns, etc. The donkeys are let off after they do their work in the afternoon. This is our right. Would there be an FIR against me if I were a candidate from an upper caste,” he asked.
