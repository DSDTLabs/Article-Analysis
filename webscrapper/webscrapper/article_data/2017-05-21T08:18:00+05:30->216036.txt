NOIDA: Ruling out the possibility of joining   or any other front, expelled   leader   hinted that he would form a new front within a few days after taking suggestions from his supporters. “We are taking suggestions from all our supporters. The front will be formed within 10-15 days,” he told TOI. When asked if the “front” would be a political party, he said that suggestions are being sought to figure out that.

 When asked by reporters citing the example of  , who joined the BJP after promising the formation of a new front and his meeting with the CM, he said that his meeting with CM Yogi Aditya Nath on May 15 was held only to demand security and there was no mention about his joining the party.
 
 “As I have already said, I met CM Yogi because there is a threat to me, my family and my supporters from a certain gang,” he said.
 
 “I have held meetings in Lucknow, today in Noida and will hold a meeting tomorrow too. Because the assembly session is on, we will hold meetings in Lucknow again on May 22-23. On May 25, I will go to Bundelkhand. There will be similar consultations there. Till Thursday, nearly 60,000 people have left BSP. These include ex-MPs and ex-MLAs, former zone coordinators, etc. These are our supporters and hence we will take a final call once suggestions come from all sides,” he told reporters.
