Bengaluru: The ongoing protest by workers of Bisi Oota, Karnataka’s flagship midday meal scheme, is likely to disrupt the serving of food at schools in several parts of the state from Thursday.

 S Shivanna, president, state midday meal workers’ federation, told TOI that they have given a notice to make alternative arrangements to run the meal programme as more of their members are joining the protest. “We are not going back till the chief minister meets us and discusses our demand for a pay hike,” he said.
 
 According to Shivanna, “The midday meal programme has already been affected in north Karnataka schools. There will be large-scale disruption from Thursday and it will spread to other areas,” he said.
 
 Over 500 chief and assistant cooks, mostly women, are sitting on an indefinite protest at Free-dom Park since Tuesday. The women even braved a bout of rain on Wednesday afternoon.
 
 “We work for a meagre Rs 2,000 and are denied of basic pay, insurance, provident fund and pension. We have left our children and families and come for the protest here. The government and the ministers concerned are not bothered about our plight,” said Rudramma Belalagere, treasurer, state midday meal workers’ federation.
 
 On Wednesday, three protesting women fell ill and had to be rushed to a nearby hospital. The women were administered IV fluids before they returned to Freedom Park.
