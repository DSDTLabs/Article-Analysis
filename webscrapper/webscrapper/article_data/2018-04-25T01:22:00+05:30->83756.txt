Krishnagiri: CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan on Tuesday said his party functionary K Suresh, 42, whose body was found in a forest area near Madakkal panchayat here on Saturday, might have been murdered by his enemies and urged the police to nab the culprits at the earliest. The police had, however, concluded that Suresh was trampled to death by a wild elephant, based on the postmortem report. Pointing out that Suresh had served the party as Kalkeri union secretary for more than two decades, Balakrishnan said, the former had many enemies as he took out many protests and demonstrations. “We suspect that someone might have murdered Suresh and dumped the body in the forest,” Balakrishnan said and urged the district administration and the police to alter the case to murder from elephant attack case. According to police, Suresh had gone out on April 19 and his wife Rajammal, 36, lodged a man missing compliant the very next day as he didn’t return home. On April 21, the police recovered Suresh’s body from a forest area near Madakkal panchayat. Doctors who performed the postmortem found that his chest bones were broken and lungs were damaged. The police later confirmed that Suresh was trampled to death by a wild elephant.
