People across age groups are all praise for Dhrubo Banerjee’s mystery drama,  , and especially Sonada ( ), who is a combination of Feluda and Indiana Jones. A professor of history at Oxford University, Subarna Sen aka Sonada helps his friend, Abir (Arjun Chakrabarty), in his mission to unearth a hidden ancestral treasure, which is linked to the rich heritage of  .

 When we asked the director what according to him made the audience receive the film with open arms, he said, “Everyone can relate to basic emotions and simplicity. The film is high on Bangaliana, something that every Bengali takes pride in. People of all age groups can relate to Sonada. Feluda demands respect while   is a larger-than-life character with a retro look. But Sonada is the quintessential Bangali boy. Abir and Jhinuk (Ishaa Saha) too represent today’s generation, so I guess all of this worked for us. Plus the film also offers a peek into the beauty of rural Bengal.”
 
 Abir Chatterjee, who is visibly happy with all the love that his character is receiving, said, “The audience had no preconceived notions about Sonada unlike other iconic characters of Bengali cinema. They found Sonada to be one of them — a new-age guy who is deeply attached to his roots, is witty, jovial, intelligent and serious when required. So, I’m sure they could instantly relate to him.”
 
 Shrikant Mohta from the production house said, “The film is doing well at the box office and people want to see more of Sonada, as he has touched everyone’s heart with his charm and intelligence. Simplicity has worked for the film.”
