JAIPUR: In a major  , the   transferred 77 IAS officers, including 16 collectors, as well as 46 IPS and 23 IFS officers on Friday.

 The overhaul has come at a time when the   is planning to push its key initiatives ahead of the state assembly elections scheduled in December 2018.
 
 The move to shift 16 collectors and 17 SPs from districts shows that the government has turned its focus on the effective implementation of its flagship programmes.
 
  remained high on the agenda of the government as reflected in the transfer of IPS officers. For the remaining term, the BJP government will now rely on these officers to turn public opinion in their favor.
 
 The transfers have also come ahead of the Collector-SP conference. "It has happened just before the conference. This will help the state government to lay down a clear cut programme of what it expects from the administration," said a senior government official who was also featured in the transfer list.
 
 The transfer list has also laid the ground for anointing the new chief secretary (CS) of the state as the incumbent, O P Meena, would superannuate in June.
 
 According to bureaucrats, the race for CS is now wide open between 1981 batch officer Ashok Jain, 1982 batch officer N C Goel and 1983 batch officer D B Gupta.
 
 By moving 1982 batch officer Vipin Chandra Sharma out of the secretariat, the government has cleared the hurdles for 1983 batch officer D B Gupta to head the bureaucracy.
 
 If the government picks Ashok Jain, no major reshuffle would be required at the top level as he will remain the senior most IAS officer in the secretariat.
 
 However, if government chooses Goel, Jain along with Rajhans Upadhyay will have to be shifted to non-cadre posts outside the state secretariat. And in the case of Gupta, Goel too will have to have to be transferred.
