 The movie is being billed as one of the most expensive movies made in Malayalam. Priyadarshan had earlier told us, “Kunjali Marakkar IV has the most interesting story. He was the one who revolted against the Zamorins and was hanged. Most of his story happens in the sea and it’s never easy to shoot such a film in the sea. It has to be shot on par with international standards and needs to be appealing for the national audience with star cast from other industries too. Our film has been planned in such a way.”
