GANDHINAGAR: While most   remained   for the entire day on Sunday, some MLAs spoke to TOI from the private resort at Bidadi, outside Bengaluru, where they have been stationed. The party has sent 44 of its legislators to the resort. Of the 57   MLAs in  , six resigned from the party over the past three days. Three of them joined the BJP on Friday. The Congress had sent its legislators to the resort to fend off “poaching” attempts by the BJP ahead of the   in Gujarat. The political plot has truly thickened.
