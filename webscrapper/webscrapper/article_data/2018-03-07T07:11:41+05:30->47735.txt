BENGALURU: The  , southern India’s only luxury  , is likely to run short-haul trips to cater to those who find its current eight-day schedule long and fares too high.

 “We are even considering one day/night trips for people who want to just experience the luxury train. When it comes to short trips, we are planning packages like Bengaluru-Mysuru-Kabini-Belur/Halebid and Mysuru-Belur/Halebid-Badami-Aihole-Hampi. We are yet to take a final call,” said  , managing director of   which operates the service. 
 
 A   official said the Golden Chariot had 40% occupancy, with around 300 passengers having availed the service till date in 2017-18. When asked about it, the officer claimed no luxury train in the country runs to full capacity given the cost and other factors.
 
 “We can run the train only between October and March. We can’t operate packages in summer given the heat factor, and passengers won’t be able to explore much during monsoon. Also, we need to hand over the train to the railways for three-month maintenance,” the officer said. 
 
 With short-duration trips, for which fares will be lesser, the KSTDC hopes for a win-win situation. The next season begins in October.
