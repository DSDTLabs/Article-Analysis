It couldn’t have been a better comeback for actress   Khattar, who is returning to TV after seven years. Not only is she fitter after losing 10 kilos, the actress will also pair opposite her real-life husband   for the first time in her career spanning over a decade. Apparently, the soap is an adaptation of the Turkish show, 'Fatmagul'.
Vandana is excited that she’d get to spend quality time with Rajesh on the set. She says, “Our colleagues have already started joking about how Rajesh is with his wife even on the set. For us, it’s the first time and we may not get a chance like this again. I have been his director and producer in theatre, but television is a different ballgame altogether. The medium has changed completely in terms of functioning.”
 Talking about their equation on screen, she reveals, “It is quite similar to the one we share off it. I am more of a giver and peacemaker, while he is impulsive and short-tempered (laughs!). While I am emotional, he is practical and dominating.”
 Vandana says Rajesh was impressed with her acting chops during the shoot of their show. “He came into my life much after I was done with TV. While the director was happy with my shot, I was waiting for his feedback. He told me, ‘Tum toh bohot achhi actress ho’. And that meant the world to me,” she recalls.
