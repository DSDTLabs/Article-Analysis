LUCKNOW: Now reporting about prolonged absenteeism of sanitary workers in your colony would be fruitful and can be proved on record as   is starting bio-metric attendance across all the zones in the city.

 By February-end, all sanitary workers will have to punch their attendance in GPS-enabled bio-metric machines.
 
 
 The move comes close to the Swachhata Survey 2018 scheduled to begin in the state capital around mid-February. Daily bio-metric attendance of sanitary workers is an essential criteria to obtain better score in the survey.
 
 LMC has started the use of these bio-metric machines in Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Alambagh, Aashiana, Chinhat, etc.
 
 LMC’s health officer PK   told  , “By the end of this month, all workers will have to punch their attendance in bio-metric machines. Their salaries will be linked to their attendance.”
 
 
 
 Till now there was no authentic record to verify complaints about sanitary workers remaining absent and not doing their duty. There were complaints of workers signing attendance sheet but not cleaning streets and drains.
 
 March onwards, sanitary inspectors will have to keep attendance record and ensure that workers work regularly. There are around 2,300 permanent sanitary workers and 900 contractual ones in the corporation.
 
 As per norms, workers cannot take more than three months’ leave at a stretch. If they do so, they face termination. If they take leave without informing their senior, their salary will be deducted.
 
 It was often noticed that workers took long leaves without informing their superiors.
 
 The services of 15 contractual workers were terminated on this ground last year.
