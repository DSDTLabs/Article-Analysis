Vadodara: Over a 100 blind persons from across the state will ‘drive’ cars through the lanes and roads of the city this Sunday. The Blind Car Rally 2017 organized by Vadodara Vibrant Round Table and Baroda Ladies Circle 76 will take off from Navrachana International School.  The organizers said that the blind men will be given a pre-decided route of the rally that will help them in guiding the vehicle. “The cars will have a blind person sitting beside the driver. They will be given a map of the entire route in Braille language and they will have to give directions to the driver,” said Vishal Sharma, one of the organizers.  “The route is about 50 km long with eight marshal points. The cars will have to report at each of these marshal points,” Sharma added. The cars can’t go too fast or too slow as they have to reach at the marshal point in designated time. “The idea is to empower the blind persons and focus on their strengths. If given a chance, the visually empowered too can do wonders,” Sharma said.  Mira Erda, who is country’s youngest Formula 4 driver, said, “It is a good gesture to bring out the talent of blind persons who are equally talented like all of us.”
