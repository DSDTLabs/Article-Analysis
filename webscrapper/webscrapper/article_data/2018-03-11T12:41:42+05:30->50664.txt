PUNE: Pune Municipal Corporation’s Rs14-crore sanitary napkin disposal project is likely to be delayed. The estimates committee rejected the project saying it was approved without the its mandatory approval.

 “We found the project cost to be more than expected. Moreover, we received some complaints about over estimation,” said a senior   official.
 
 As per the proposal, the civic body will install sanitary napkin disposal units in each ward office. The standing committee has diverted Rs5 crore for the project. It was one of the 65 projects that were sanctioned in the last standing committee meeting headed by former chairman  .
 
 “There is no transparency in this process. The cost is nearly 10 to 20 times higher than the open market rates. We are not against the disposal units, but the way the tender has been approved seems biased,” said leader of opposition Chetan Tupe.
 
 PMC officials said the facilities have been installed in different parts of the city. Each unit has a capacity to dispose of around 600 to 900 sanitary napkins per day.
 
 “A system for collection, transportation and disposal has been specially developed for the same and the focus areas are working women’s hostels, red light areas and big residential societies. Extension of these services to 15 more locations across the city has been proposed,” said a civic official.
