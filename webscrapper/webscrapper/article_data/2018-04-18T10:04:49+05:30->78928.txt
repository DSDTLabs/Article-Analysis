CHANDIGARH: The   and   high court on Tuesday issued a notice to the governments of Haryana and Punjab on a plea against non-issuance of bills by the liquor vendors on purchase of alcohol.

 A division bench headed by Justice A K Mittal issued the notice after hearing an application filed by an NGO Arrive Safe through its president  .
 
 According to the applicant, on March 6, the HC had directed both Haryana and Punjab to make it obligatory for the liquor vendors to issue invoices for all the sales effected by them from their outlets with effect from the start of the 2018-19 financial year.
 
 It was stated that the financial year 2018-19 began on April 1, 2018, and the applicant started getting calls and messages from various people who complained that they visited various vends in Haryana and Punjab and none of the liquor vendors were issuing bills to them even though the vendors were well aware of the HC orders.
 
 The court was also told that compelled by the circumstances the applicant himself visited various vends in Punjab and Haryana for the necessary purpose and found the information to be true as the vendors refused to issue him bills. To ensure some kind of strict action through a court of law, the applicant also purchased bottles from these vends and has kept them safe in his custody.
 
 The HC was also informed about the news report carried by TOI regarding non-compliance of court orders regarding issuance of bills for liquor sale. In his plea, the petitioner has sought directions for strict compliance of the court directions regarding mandatory issuance bill on purchase of liquor.
 
 The matter would now come up for further hearing on April 23 when the excise departments of both states have to respond to the contentions raised by the applicant.
