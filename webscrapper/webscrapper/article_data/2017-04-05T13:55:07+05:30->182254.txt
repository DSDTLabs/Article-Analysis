LUDHIANA: Another attempt by the excise and   to dispose off liquor vends in   proved to be a flop show after liquor contractors boycotted the draw . 

 The department had not received any bids after floating a tender for allotment of these vends for year 2017-18 last week. However, sources say that several contractors had contacted the department and are likely to submit their bids on Wednesday, the last day for the submission of tenders. The result for the same will also be announced the same day. 
 
 Giving information, Ludhiana deputy excise and taxation commissioner   said, “We have invited quotations for retail liquor vends for 16 groups for Ludhiana. In addition to this, tenders have also been called for Khanna, Doraha, Samrala,Macchiwara,Jagraon and Raikot that will be received till pm on April 5 and will be opened the same day at 4pm.”
 
 Meanwhile, the contractors are tight lipped over what their next course of action is going to be. A local liquor contractor, who spoke to TOI on condition of anonymity, said the contractors had struck a compromise amongst themselves and the company of a late liquor baron would be   in the tender process. The company would take up the entire contract and sub contract this among the locals, he added.
