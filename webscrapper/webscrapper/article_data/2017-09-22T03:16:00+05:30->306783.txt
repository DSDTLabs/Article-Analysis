Panaji: Practical experience, which is a must for engineering students, should be slotted between semesters and not at the end of the term,   Manohar Parrikar said.

 The timing of internship is important to help students understand the relevance of theory studied in college, Parrikar said after inaugurating the internship and apprenticeship programme organised by directorate of technical education and the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), for engineering graduates, on Wednesday. 
 
 Director of technical education Vivek Kamat, said the existing provision of two weeks of internship for engineering students is not enough to gain hands-on-experience, leading to inadequate preparation for recruitment.
