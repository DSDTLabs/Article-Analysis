From special dietary regulations to setting up khus ( ) screens, keepers of the premises have been doing everything they can. As the director of  , Dr  , maintains, “The animals need special treatment to battle the rising temperature. They are already away from their natural habitat where they use their instincts and natural topography to keep themselves cool. Indore is more of a concrete jungle, so it becomes imperative to create a cool environment for the animals during summer.” Even birds, that are most susceptible to rising temperatures, are getting vitamin supplements to keep their energy levels high. “In their natural process of life, birds migrate to colder places to maintain their body temperatures. But special care and artificial cooling becomes important for birds in captivity,” shares ornithologist Mohammad Khaliq.

 
  
 In order to retain the body fluid levels, the zookeepers are making sure they feed the animals with various fruits. “The diet during summers is full of juicy fruits like watermelons, cucumbers and mangoes. For birds we add essential vitamins to their regular feed in order to meet their nutritional requirements,” explains  , zoo curator and educational officer. He adds that fruits and vegetables that have more water and vitamin content keep the digestive tract of the animals cool. The big cats too have been getting controlled portions of meat to keep them healthy through the summer. Some zoos in other parts of the country have been introducing curd rice for some animals to help with their digestion. When enquired about the same, Nihar informs, “While curd has some real benefits to humans during this season, it is not a natural occurring food for the wild animals. Though the animals have been reared in captivity, it is not advisable to change their food habits.”
 
  
 
  
 
 To maintain an optimum body temperature of the animals, cage keepers work tirelessly right from 8 am to 5 pm giving the bigger animals regular showers and putting out coolers and sprinklers for others. “In the morning, cooling baths are given to the tigers (Lucky, Adam and Jamuna) and the elephants (Moti and Laxmi). The bears (Krishna, Prabha, Gajni and Chotu) like to splash around in their shelters where water barrels are kept,” shares a cage keeper. Besides the regular baths, khus screens have been set up around all shelters which are regularly sprinkled with water throughout the day to keep the areas cool. “Khus screens are natural coolers and also give out a pleasant dewy fragrance that reminds one of everything green. The bigger animals are provided with coolers in addition to all this, owing to their body size and fat percentage,” shares Parulekar. Chimps and deer, on the other hand, get a green cover to imitate their natural habitat. The zoo authorities add more plants by March to their shelters for this.
 
  
  
 
 Besides regulating the diet and creating a cool environment, the zoo authorities also take adequate precautions in order to avoid any instances of heatstroke. “Since these animals are residing in the heart of city, we make sure to take precautionary measures during peak summer. We add Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) in a prescribed quantity to their water bowls, to keep them sufficiently hydrated. Similarly, cage keepers give a report every three hours on the status of the animals. Reptiles are very vulnerable during the season and they are closely monitored. If any animal shows signs of suffering a heatstroke, it is immediately shifted to the zoo hospital and kept in an air-conditioned area for recuperation under supervision of certified vets,” informs Yadav.
