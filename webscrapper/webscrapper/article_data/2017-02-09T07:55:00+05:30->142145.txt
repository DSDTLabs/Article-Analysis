GURUGRAM: Vice-president of the   (NCW)   launched a visceral attack on Gurugram police on Wednesday, calling it incompetent in resolving crime against women. 

 Sharma claimed that the maximum number of cases of crime against women in the state was reported from Gurgaon, but when TOI sought for figures to substantiate the allegation, the commission failed to provide any data.
 
 “Gurgaon police is not serious about resolving cases of crime against women. We will file a complaint with the government regarding the same. It is important that cops behave properly with the women victims who go to police station to register their complaints. There is a need for investigating officers to be sensitive towards the victims,” Sharma said while addressing a press conference at the PWD House in Old Gurgaon.
 
 In the second public hearing organised by the NCW, Sharma resolved 42 of the 125 pending cases of crime against women that the commission had forwarded to the district in the past one year. The first such hearing was held in Panchkula. 
 
 Out of the 125 cases, 60 cases were resolved by the police, while 42 cases were resolved during Wednesday’s public hearing itself. 
 
 She also raised a demand to resolve cases of crime against women in a time bound manner. 
 
 Responding to her remarks, police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar said, “Gurgaon is a big city and there are a lot of cases relating to crime against women. Many of them are personal and domestic disputes. We have a dedicated police station for women and personnel are trained on a regular basis to handle such cases.”
