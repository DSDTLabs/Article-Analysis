HYDERABAD: Demanding that the state withdraw its private universities  , students of   staged a dharna on Tuesday slamming it as a move to privatise education.

 The protesters, who participated in a rasta roko programme organised under the aegis of the   (ABVP), demanded that the state government immediately strengthen the existing universities by allocating them higher budgets.
 
 “If the state government introduces this Bill, state-run varsities will go the way of many government schools that are on the verge of closure. They should first strengthen the existing varsities and improve basic facilities in these colleges. Without doing this, there is absolutely no need for this Bill,” said P  , in-charge, OU, ABVP, adding that they would be organising a series of protests over the next few days to oppose the Bill.
 
 The protesters accused the government of neglecting state universities and at the same time encouraging privatisation of higher education.
 
 “This Bill is a conspiracy to kill government institutions. At least now they should allocate a higher budget to these institutions and strengthen them so that poor students will be benefited. Also, they should establish executive council at the varsity level and fill up the vacant teaching and non-teaching posts,” said   M, a protester.
 
 The agitating students said they would gherao the Assembly if the state government failed to take back the Bill immediately.
 
 A Bill to allow private universities was introduced in the state Assembly on Tuesday and will be taken up for discussion on Wednesday.
 
 According to the draft Bill, a private university that wants to commence operations in the state will have to earmark 25 per cent of its seats to students belonging to Telangana. The managements of private varsities cannot seek any grant-in-aid or financial assistance from the Centre or the state government.
 
 However, they can get research projects or academic projects from the state government or Centre.
