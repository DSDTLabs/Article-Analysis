BHUBANESWAR: Youngsters, as well as the young at heart, had the time of their lives at   here for an evening with singing sensation  . 

 Organised by The Times of India, the live concert was opened by Srini who sang the popular romantic number Jeena Jeena of the film 'Badlapur'. Her second song Deewani Mastani from the film 'Bajirao Mastani' before Javed made his grand entry.
 
 The audience, eagerly waiting for the star attraction of the night, went wild pretty much as soon as Ali took over. Ali started with Jashn-e-bahara from the Bollywood film 'Jodhaa Akbar'. 
 
 As the entire auditorium sang along with Ali, the singer moved on to his own song from his recent album Rangrezia. "What an evening. We had a great time and won't forget it soon," said Sonika Dash, a college student.
 
 Ali then went on to sing chartbusters like Tu Meri Adhuri Pyaas Pyaas from the Aamir Khan-starrer 'Ghajini,' Tu Jo Mila from 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan', and Channa Mereya of 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'. 
 
 He soon moved on from romantic hits to Sufi songs, giving what seemed to be much-needed relief to the audience in the summer heat. His renditions of Kun Faya from 'Rockstar' and Arziyan from 'Delhi 6' impressed the crowd.
 
 A medley of hits followed, in response to which the Bhubaneswar audience were happy to switch on their cellphone torches and sway with the rhythm.
 
 "Odisha people are very musical. Our music industry has got many talented artists from Odisha. They love music a lot," said Ali to the audience.
