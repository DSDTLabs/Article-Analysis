HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N  's native   district is all set to get an industrial boost with the government planning to set up one Micro   (MSME) unit in all constituencies, except Tirupati.

 Of the 14 constituencies in the district, Gangadhara Nellore, Pileru, Nagari and Putalapattu are industrially backward with hardly any investments. Officials are now gearing up to change this.
 
 “We have identified 1,235 acres, which will be handed over to the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC). The nodal agency will lay roads, provide water and power amenities in these areas,“ an official said.
 
 The units will come up in Chittoor, Palamaner, Srikalahasti, Varadayyapalyam, Chandragiri, Santipuram, Kurabalakota, Madanapalle, and Punganur. Officials are hoping to generate about 1,000 direct jobs through these MSME units. Officials are also gearing to provide technical training and skill development training to the youth in these areas to enable them to get jobs.
 
 As per the state industrial policy, units with up to `25 lakh investment are classified as micro industries, those with investments up to `5 crore are termed small industries while large industries are those with at least `250 crore.Anything above that is classified as a mega unit.
