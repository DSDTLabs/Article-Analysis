BHOPAL: A division bench of M P high court on Friday ordered cancellation of admission of 85 students to   course in various private medical colleges of the state. All the 85 students in question were non-domiciles of MP and got admissions during the mop-up round of counselling.

 Petitioners in the case had alleged that private medical colleges in collusion with directorate of medical education (DME) officials had ‘sold’ the seats on which admission were given during the mop-up round of counselling in NEET-2017. While meritorious students of MP were denied admission, non-domiciles, who didn’t appear in counselling at all were admitted in lieu of graft, they alleged.
 
 They had further alleged that 10 domiciles, who got admission in the mop-up round of counselling, too, had obtained less than the minimum qualifying marks for admission in MBBS, but the court refused to cancel their admissions.
 
 DME in its submission before the court had said that 84 non-domiciles had to be admitted in MBBS courses in private colleges because domiciles from MP were not available for admission.
 
 Counsel for the petitioners,  , however, told the court that after third round of counselling in the mop-up round, students were asked at 7.00 pm to proceed to respective colleges allotted to them with requisite papers and get admission by midnight, which was not possible and taking advantage of their inability to reach there within the deadline, the seats were filled by non-domiciles, who had enough money to buy the seats.
 
 The division bench of Justice   and Justice  , while partially allowing the petition, said that petitioners could seek further relief including admission into MBBS course by moving to   and placing this decision of the high court.
