Panaji: The government on Friday told the high court of Bombay at Goa that it has issued necessary orders directing civic bodies to incorporate a condition in the construction licence that construction waste debris should be deposited at government notified sites. The submission was made in reference to a contempt petition filed by advocate Aires Rodrigues over inaction by authorities by continuing to dump construction debris and garbage along the Panaji-Old Goa bypass road. When the matter came up for hearing on Friday, a division bench comprising justices NM Jamdar and Prithviraj Chavan, the court was given details of a meeting convened by the advocate general on April 30 which was attended by amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) Norma Alvares and the petitioner along with heads of the departments concerned to devise ways to remove all existing debris by the end of May. The meeting was held on the direction of the court. It was suggested that a flying squad be deputed, along with officials of various departments, to monitor the dumping of construction debris. This will ensure that no dumping is permitted and that any material dumped is removed by the respective local body. It was also suggested that government shall direct urban bodies, panchayats and corporations to remove all the existing debris lying in their jurisdictions before the onset of monsoon. Apart from the 13 sites notified by the government, few more sites should be identified and added to the list for areas such as Sattari, Sanguem and Quepem. Amicus curiae suggested that before issuing any license, civic bodies should carry out an inspection and ascertain the quantum of debris likely to be generated.  The next meeting will be convened by the advocate general in the first week of July, and thereafter every month, to find solutions to ensure that Goa remains free of construction debris in public places.  The court will next hear the matter on June 5.
