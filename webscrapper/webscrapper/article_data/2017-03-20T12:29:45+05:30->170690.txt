  "They're pretty level-headed about it so far. My daughter thinks it's very funny that there are premieres, people get excited to see us all, she doesn't quite understand why.
  
  "My daughter was five when we filmed this, so just perfect age to walk into a ballroom full of princesses and freak out. They've now seen the film and it's a pretty magical experience," Stephens says.
  
  "My son was with a friend the other day and Beast and Belle were on the cover of a magazine and his friend was getting very excited, there we were, and my son just went, 'Yeah that's just my dad in a suit'. He's not that fazed.
