We had earlier reported that director Rakesh Gopan's female-centric film  , which had five actresses in the lead, is soon to be remade in Telugu and Tamil with Yaaradi Nee Mohini fame filmmaker Mithran Jawahar helming the remakes.

  The Malayalam movie had Shweta Menon, Meghana Raj, Ananya, Bhama and Haritha Parokod. Actress   had been roped in for the remakes and now we hear that she will be playing  's character in the film.
 
  The writers though have changed the profession of the character from a TV journalist to an RJ. 'Shweta's character in the original is changed to an RJ for the remake but her bold personality is very much intact,' says Raai Laxmi. 'Also, I have played a journalist in the past, so this would a new challenge for me.'
  The remakes had to be tweaked for the Tamil and Telugu audiences as they might not relate to the Malayalam version as it is, says Raai Laxmi. 'However, the plot of the movie would be the same.'
  The actress, who was last seen in Malayalam in Rajadhi Raja, says she is currently working on the looks and references given to her for the role.
 
  'The director is also finalising the other cast members and we will be figuring out the looks and other details, once the discussions are over,' she says.
  Raai Laxmi is also doing a Tamil-Malayalam bilingual psychological thriller named Yaaru, which is directed by K S Bava.
