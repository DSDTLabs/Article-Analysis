CHENNAI: For the past one year, since the day he last saw his daughter, 35-year-old Chandran* has gone through that fateful day several times. Every moment he went back in time, he looked for a clue. “Something that would tell me that I wasn’t a bad father to leave our daughter alone,” said the IT professional.

 On Monday,   got a closure. “No, I wasn’t a bad father. I just didn’t believe someone could harm something so precious,” he said stoically.
 
 When the judge sentenced 23-year-old   to death, whispers reached Chandran who was sitting in the public prosecutor’s office diagonally opposite to the courtroom. Dashvanth was held guilty for the sexual assault and murder of Chandran’s seven-year-old daughter last February.
 
 “My daughter has finally got justice,” he said. Chandran refused to see Dashvanth who stood expressionless as the judge read out the verdict in the room nearby. “I don’t want to see his face,” he said heatedly describing the last one year as “hell” for him and his family.
 
 “It had come to a point where it was either him or me who would be alive. The court chose who should die,” said Chandran who, along with his family, moved out of his house in   following his daughter’s murder.
 
 He spoke without tearing up, until he received a call from his wife. The couple said little to each other, they just wept. “We did it,” he said in Telugu.
 
 Parents shouldn’t try hushing up when they know their children have been violated, said Chandran. “Because when they speak up and fight, they aren’t doing it for their child alone. It is to end the suffering of so many others whose stories go untold,” he said.
 
 Chandran knows that his loss is irreplaceable. “We may never recover from it, but we feel it has lit a fire that should not stop,” he said.
