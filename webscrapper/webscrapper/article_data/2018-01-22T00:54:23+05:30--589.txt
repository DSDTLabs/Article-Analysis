At an interactive session between a minister and entrepreneurs in the city, the minister was patiently making note of the queries and requests on a sheet of paper, intending to address them at the end of the session. When a woman from the audience got up and shot several questions to the minister, he kept nodding and noting them down. The woman lost her patience and demanded an answer from the minister. Taken aback, the bewildered minister assured her that she would address all queries when everyone finished asking questions.

 Labouring to get one’s due
 
 A shop owner had sold vegetables to a five-star hotel in the city, but the hotel owners failed to make the payment. When several requests for payment failed, the shop owner took a desperate measure - he took a herd of donkeys to the hotel and made them stray near the entrance. When it did not yield result, he took the help of transgenders. This was more than what the hotel owner could cope with and he finally paid up.
 
 Unreceptive city?
 
 At a culture fest held in the city recently, hardly a handful of people were in the audience when a reporter reached the venue. It was surprising that not many were aware of a fest being conducted on this scale. One of the musicians who claimed to have composed 2,525 songs on the spot for three days was so deprived of sleep that he could hardly walk or talk. But when journalists reached the spot, he was asked to dress up and even got ready to perform. And he eventually got onto the stage for the closing ceremony and performed as well. But sadly, there was no audience.
 
 RTOs off track
 
 During the bus strike in the city, RTOs turned into HR companies of the government as they were forced to work day and night and get drivers. The RTOs had to jot down details of all heavy vehicle drivers from their server, check their background and even call them for a test drive. “These are jobs that a HR does and we have no idea why we are forced to do this,” said an official.
