LUDHIANA: Panic gripped   village on  , about 12 kms from here, after shells and bombs, most of them live, were found at an under-construction residential colony.

 The police said on Monday around 7.30am, a resident spotted shells and bombs near the inner road, about 50 metres from the Alamgir gate, and called the cops at 100.
 
 The police control room alerted Dehlon police, who covered the area with about 30 sand bags and cordoned it off. Gill   Gurjeet Singh said the ammunition comprised 26 tank shells and four hand grenades. “The Ludhiana police have written to the deputy commissioner, requesting him to ask the   unit at   for a bomb disposal squad to collect the ammo from the spot,“ he added.
 
 Police said it was suspected that the ammunition came in the containers with scrap from the Gulf and the furnace owner, who received it, might have thrown it at the empty plot to avoid harassment.
 
 The ACP said Dehlon police would make an entry about the recovery in the daily diary report and even as the shells and bombs were rusted, whether they we re live or dead would be known only after Arr my's bomb disposal squad inspected them.
 
 “We have deploy ed cops at the spot and they will remain there till the ammunition is picked up. There was const ruction work going on at the plot and we have asked the owner to stop it as a precautionary measure,“ said the police officer.
 
 A resident said the ammunition had been lying there for the past four days and as not many people pass through the area, these remained unnoticed. Police officials said those were two types of tank shells, one measuring around one feet and the other half a feet.
 
 They added that average weight of each shell was around 15 kg.
