Surat: Gujarat Rajya Sahakari Sangh (GRSS) has decided to legally fight issuance of income tax (I-T) notices to cooperative mandalis for recovery of tax dues on the interest earned on their fixed deposits in banks. 

 GRSS leaders at a meeting at Kamrej on Thursday decided to hold a farmers’ sammelan and passed a resolution to appoint reputed lawyers to fight the case against the I-T department in the court. They will meet Union finance minister Arun Jaitley before taking legal recourse.
 
 At least seven milk mandalis in Surat were issued income tax notices last week and two of Mahua taluka in the district received notices on Thursday. 
 
 Around 80,000 cooperatives in the state have Rs25,000 crore worth of fixed deposits in the district cooperative banks. They earn around Rs1,700 crore in interest on fixed deposits. If these cooperatives pay tax at the rate of 30% on interest earned to the I-T department, the amount will be around Rs510 crore.
 
 Sumul director Jayesh Patel Delad said, “Mandalis continue to receive income tax notices. Some have received while others will be getting soon. We will have to fight collectively.” 
 
 Kudiyana Dudh Mandli has received a notice for Rs3.1 lakh, Kola Dudh Mandli for Rs1.1 lakh, Pinjrat Dudh Mandli for Rs4.2 lakh, Vankal Dudh Mandli for Rs21.22 lakh, Kamrej Kela Mandli for Rs31.12 lakh, Angaldhara Dudh Mandli for Rs10.11 lakh and Vehval Dudh Mandli for Rs2.25 lakh in income tax dues.
