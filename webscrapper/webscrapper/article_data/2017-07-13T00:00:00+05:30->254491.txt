As the protests to retain KH   gained momentum on the fourth day, many of the city’s prominent faces from theatre showed their solidarity by signing on a campaign both online and offline to ensure that the auditorium’s rent doesn’t increase and it remains as an affordable performance space.
Noted theatreperson-screenwriter-actor Rajendra Karanth kickstarted the offline signature campaign on Tuesday evening, by being the first to sign it. Many known faces, including Sandalwood actors and theatrepersons   and Sihi Kahi Chandru also lent their support and signed on the poster.
 PD   from  , who have been taking care of the performance arena, says that the next plan will see many people submit letters requesting the Joint Commissioner and   letters requesting him to get Kala Soudha up and running, since it hasn’t been functional since February. They plan on having as many people submit letters to him today (Thursday). 
 This will then be followed by performances by many of the city’s theatre groups over the next few days on the foyer, as a protest.
