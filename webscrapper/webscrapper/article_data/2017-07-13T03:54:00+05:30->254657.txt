Panaji: A sunken barge near Rasaim ferry ramp in the Zuari river is in the process of being salvaged and, after a slow fortnight-long operation, a part of the vessel has been hauled up from a shallow depth. The barge, lying at anchor close to the Rasaim side of the bank near Rasaim-Durbhat ramp, sunk on May 29 due to long-term effects of corrosion. The enforcement of a mining ban since September 2012 had brought ore transportation activities to a halt. “The aft side of the vessel with the engine has been hauled up by salvagers. This was the most difficult part,” a source said. The work of salvaging had commenced within a few days after the barge sinking. The task of ascertaining the damage in the muddy river, with poor visibility underwater, is difficult. Once the broken and damaged parts are located, quick-fixing cement that dries up within four hours is used to help refloat the vessel. “After more than a fortnight, one-third of the vessel is now visible. Chances of floating it within the next couple of days are good,” the source said. The vessel is not hampering ferry operations on the Rasaim-Durbhat route. “Ferries have been asked to deviate from the vessel,” an official of ports administration department said. Another barge had sunk in the river about 30 years ago, a little away from the same ramp, but it was not removed, as the rules related to salvaging of vessels came into force much later. “The vessel must have disintegrated by now,” the source said.
