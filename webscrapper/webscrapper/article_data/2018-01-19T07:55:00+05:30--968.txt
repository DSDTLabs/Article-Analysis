MANALI: The   valley in   has completely run out of fuel stock, bringing taxi service to a complete halt and forcing residents to walk the distance to reach their destinations.

 Snowfall in December has cut off Lahaul from the rest of state. The internal roads of the valley, including Sissu-Keylong, Keylong-Darcha, Darcha-Udaipur highways and link roads, are open. The lone fuel pump at Tandi has been shut and even the vehicle owners have run out of stock. This situation of fuel exhaustion has made the roads wear a completely deserted look.
 
 “We have no fuel stock. We met with the deputy commissioner and requested him to resolve the problem. He has assured us of finding a way out,”   taxi operator union president   said. The cabbies even blamed the cops for their woes, saying those who had stocked diesel for use in winters had been booked under Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act. They pointed out that while government vehicles are still moving on roads (which also use stocked fuel) no action was not taken against them.
 
  deputy commissioner   said the problem had been brought to his notice and the administration was looking for a viable solution.
