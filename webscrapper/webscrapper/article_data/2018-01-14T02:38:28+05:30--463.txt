NOIDA: Criminal cases registered in Noida and   have decreased in the past one year but the number of murders in the twin cities has seen a slight rise in 2017, according to the annual data released by police. 
 
 The total number of cases registered in 2017 in the two cities stood at 9,605, down from 10,818 in 2016. Although crimes registered across police stations in Noida decreased by 10.13% overall, two sectors — 39 and 49 — reported a significant spurt in murders as well as vehicle thefts. Across the eight police stations and the one handled by women cops in Noida, cases of loot, snatching,   and vehicle theft have decreased. 
 
 The data released by the police showed the number of rape cases had come down to 49 last year from 86 in 2016. The number of murders, however, has seen a rise from 32 to 42 in a year. Cases of abduction, too, have increased by nine to 219 in 2017. On the rising cases of abduction, police officers said complaints of missing children were automatically converted to abduction if the children were not traced in 24 hours. Many of these children have been reunited with their parents, the officers pointed out. 
 
 An analysis of the sectorwise data shows that heinous crimes have increased in Sector 39 in the past one year. While there has been 13 murders in 2017 as against nine the year before, cases of loot have also increased from 29 to 31.

Arun Kumar  , SP (city) Noida, praised his force for the decrease in number of crimes, saying strict police and sustained arrests had improved law and order situation in the area. “Around 50-60 people were arrested recently and their criminal network collapsed. We also recovered 200 phones,” he said. 
 
 However, asked about the rising cases of murder, Singh said: “Murders take place when criminals do not think about consequences. We keep tabs on people with a criminal background and those released on bail to ensure they are not into criminal activities again. We have worked on these murder cases and solved them.” He said the city police had prepared a blueprint for swift manoeuvering of personnel in cases of emergency. “Police officers have been sensitised about coded messages — A,B, C, D, E, F — when there is demand for their deployment. They have to move according to the plan,” Singh said. The   government has proposed six more police stations in Noida city for maintaining law and order.
