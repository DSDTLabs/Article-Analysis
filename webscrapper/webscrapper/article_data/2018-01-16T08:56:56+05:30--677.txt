BENGALURU: A 21-year-old BCom student, who sought to broker peace between two of his friends, was stabbed to death by one of them near Arasanahalli village on Vijayapura Road, off Devanahalli, on Sunday evening.

 Police said Madhu Kumar, a Vijayapura resident and final-year undergraduate student with a private college, was by mistake stabbed by Roshan, 22, a Devanahalli resident and an automobile firm staffer. Roshanâ€™s target was his estranged friend, Sujay Kumar, but Madhu came in the way.
 
 Probe revealed Roshan and Sujay had stopped talking to each other two years ago, after the former failed to attend the last rites of a common friend, who was killed in an accident. 
 
 Madhu decided to get the estranged friends together and set up a meeting at an eucalyptus grove near Sulibele. Madhu also took his friend Venkatesh along for the meeting. The quartet downed a few drinks and later were returning on two bikes, when they decided to stop near Arasanahalli village for a smoke. 
 
 Roshan told them he wanted to leave early and went towards his bike. A furious Sujay slapped him. Roshan pulled out a knife in a fit of rage and went to stab Sujay. Madhu came in between the two and the knife cut his neck. A bleeding Madhu was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead.
 
 Police have filed a case of murder. The body was handed over to the family after postmortem at MVJ Hospital, Hosakote. A team headed by Nandagudi CI Manjunath detained Roshan by Monday. The accused will be produced before the court by Tuesday, Manjunath said.
