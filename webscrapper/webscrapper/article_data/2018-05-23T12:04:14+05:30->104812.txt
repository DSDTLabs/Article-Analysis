CHANDIGARH: Leader of opposition in Haryana and senior INLD MLA   said on Tuesday that country's voters had given an overwhelming mandate to the   in the absence of an alternative. "But now that a third front was emerging, people have a credible alternative to keep the   and BJP away from power," he said while addressing a joint gathering of the INLD and   workers at Fatehabad during the ongoing 'Jail Bharo Andolan' for completion of the SYL canal. 

 
 Abhay promised that if voted to power, the INLD-BSP government would raise the old age pension to Rs 2,500 per month and give unemployment allowance of Rs 15,000 per month. It will also fulfil promises made to farmers.
 
 Addressing the gathering, BSP's state president   too came down heavily on the   government, accusing it of promoting the interests of big-time industrialists at the cost of farmers, labourers and the downtrodden. He assured that once the INLD-BSP government was formed in the state, the problems of these sections would be addressed on priority.
 
 More than 1,200 volunteers courted arrest on Tuesday and apart from Abhay, those who were arrested on Tuesday were Prakash Bharati, Narendra Prajapati and Krishan Jamalpur of the BSP, INLD MP Charanjit Singh Rori and MLAs Ranbir Gangwa, Balwan Singh Daulatpuria and Ravinder Baliyala and other senior party leaders.
