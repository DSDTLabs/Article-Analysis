AHMEDABAD:   is going to venture into the frozen snack market, the company said on Saturday. “Around 7-8 types of frozen snacks will be launched in the next two weeks, including paneer and cheese parathas, patties and samosas. We are looking at what other such snacks could be offered in future,” announced RS Sodhi, MD, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets milk and milk products under Amul brand. 

 The decision of expansion was taken as Amul already has a robust cold chain required for frozen products. “Amul is the only player which has a well-established cold chain network with 66 depots and 2 lakh outlets from Leh-Ladakh to Kanyakumari and from Jaisalmer to Shillong. Frozen food products are already being consumed in India. Hence, we thought of venturing into it,” Sodhi said. 
 
 Amul plans to invest Rs 2,000 crore over the next two years for the expansion, including setting up of new plants. “We are in the process of setting up dairy plants in Kolkata and Vashi . Another plant with around 2 lakh litres per day (LPD) capacity is planned at Varanasi,” Sodhi added. 
 
 Back home in Gujarat, Amul will invest around Rs 600 crore for expanding the milk processing of its Amul-Fed Dairy at Bhat in Gandhinagar from 35 lakh LPD to 50 lakh LPD.“GCMMF’s turnover is expected to rise by nearly 18% to Rs 27,000 crore in fiscal 2016-17,” Sodhi said.
