Gandhinagar: According to officials figures, tabled in the assembly by deputy CM Nitin Patel in a written reply to a question by Congress MLA Amit Chavda, the state government spent Rs 94.12 crore on studies to see if Kalpasar (a dam across the Gulf of Khambhat) is feasible. It hasn’t yet been found to be feasible.

 Patel said: “The last surveys were done in 2010 and 2014, and the physical boundary of the dam has been proposed based on them. According to the report of Netherlands-based Haskoning, the approximate cost would be Rs 45,165 crore at 1999 prices. A total of Rs 94.12 crore was spent on that feasibility study. Work will begin when the final feasibility report, other necessary studies, tests and administrative approvals are be cleared.”
 
 According to the latest projections of the Gujarat government, it will take at least three to five years more to decide if Kalpasar is technically feasible. If it is considered feasible, it will take another 12 to 15 years to build the dam. According to key officials associated with the project, if found feasible, the Kalpasar project will take at least 20 years. 
 
 The latest project cost estimate was a whopping Rs 90,000 crore (at 2015-16 prices). The state government has spent more than Rs 100 crore on Kalpasar related expenditure in the last five years and a total of more than Rs 250 crore to ascertain if the project is feasible.
