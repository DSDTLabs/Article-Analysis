Recent developments in the state have made us believe that the judiciary doesn’t take incidents of honour killing lightly. And   says that his film,  , will highlight the same. The director, who has earlier made Silandhi in Kollywood, says, “Filmmakers have touched upon the issue of honour killing in their films in Tamil cinema, but my venture will shine the focus light on it. The film will look at the issue from both the sides — that of the couple and their parents.”

 While   plays the lead in the film,  , who has appeared in a handful of Tamil and Telugu films, including   and Bramman, plays the heroine. “Raja is a kabaddi player in real life and he fit the role of the hero perfectly. In fact, he was so impressed with the story that he decided to produce the film himself. Malavika, too, has a solid role; with this film, she will come to be known as a performer. The film deals with the relationship between a kabaddi player and a girl from a well-to-do family. Saranya Ponvannan plays the hero’s mother, who works in a brick kiln, and I can say with confidence that her role will fetch her another National Award. Aadukalam Naren, who plays the heroine’s father, told me that he was moved to tears while dubbing for the film,” he tells us.
 
 While post-production work is on, Aadhiraajan says he plans to release the trailer and audio by this month.
