CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh district court on Friday issued non-bailable warrants (NBW) against three accused in the murder of a Hoshiarpur village   in Sector 38 last year. Judge Imanbir Singh Dhaliwal issued NBWs against Dilpreet Singh, Davinder Singh alias Rinda and Harjinder Singh alias Gaddiwala.

 The court gave these directions based on an application submitted by the Chandigarh police.
 
 According to the application, the main accused   had admitted that the three were present at time of the crime. Later, the police had received a video captured by a woman which established that Dilpreet, Harjinder and Rinda had shot the sarpanch.
 
 The Chandigarh police had filed a chargesheet against Manjeet on May 8 under sections 302 (punishment for murder), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The court had added murder sections in the challan. 
 
 A total of 26 witnesses have been included in the challan. The complainant, doctor, and police officials have been made chief witnesses in the challan.
 
 In April last year, the then sarpanch of a village in Hoshiarpur was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Sector 38.
