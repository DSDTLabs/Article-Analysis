 is one among a few Tollywood film personalities who wasn't able to make it big, despite enough background in the industry. 

 Being born to a maverick director K Raghavendra Rao couldn't do any good to the young actor-turned-director who is still waiting to taste success. After making debut as a hero in 'Neetho', Prakash considered acting isn't his cup of tea and concentrated on screen writing, direction and script making. 
 
 His directorial venture ' ' starring Siddharth and Shruti Haasan turned out to become a debacle at the box office, despite critical acclaim. Later, after a long gap, Prakash directed   in 'Size Zero', whose script is penned by his wife, Kanika Dhillon. However, 'Size Zero' too, couldn't land the enthusiastic film maker in a safe place. 
 
 Latest we hear is that Prakash is ready with a fresh story that is going to be narrated to actor Sharwanand. If reports are anything to go by, Prakash would be soon directing Sharwanand, which will be produced by Prasad Devineni and Shobu Yarlagadda. 
 
 Let us hope that Prakash hits it right with his next venture.
