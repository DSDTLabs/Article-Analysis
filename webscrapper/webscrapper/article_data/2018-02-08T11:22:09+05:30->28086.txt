PATNA: The   (MCI), which had stopped admissions to two-year PG diploma course in tuberculosis (TB) and chest diseases at   and Hospital ( ) last year after raising 12 objections, is yet to give permission to the hospital to restart the course despite submission of compliance report by the authorities concerned in December last year.

 “The course had started at PMCH in 1965 and it was probably for the first time that an MCI team inspected facilities at the hospital’s TB and chest department last year. The MCI stopped admissions for 2017-19 session citing faculty shortage and other problems,” said a PMCH source.
 
 PMCH was the only government medical college in the state that had been offering a PG diploma course in TB and chest diseases. “The MCI team had raised 12 objections and we have already submitted the compliance report. However, the council has so far not given us the green signal to restart the course,” said Dr Ashok Shankar  , head of PMCH’s TB and chest department. 
 
 “During inspection, the MCI was surprised to find that the department had only seven faculty members against the sanctioned 26 posts. It also observed a marked decline in the number of patients visiting the department. While 15,000 patients visited the department in 2015, the number came down to 14,000 in 2016,” said a source. 
 
 Instead of 60 beds in the two TB and chest units and six beds in the ICU, the department was functioning with 50 and four beds, respectively. The MCI had also objected to the absence of requisite infrastructure in the department.
 
 However, Dr Singh said many private colleges have lesser faculty members against sanctioned posts, but the MCI never stopped them from running the course.
 
 MCI member Dr   said the PMCH authorities should apply for re-inspection and pursue the case with the council with utmost seriousness. “The MCI rejects applications for valid reasons only. It is the duty of the PMCH to do course correction,” Dr Singh added.
