NEW DELHI: If only the parents had understood the frantic actions of their dog, perhaps their daughter might have been saved from drowning in a canal near   in   on Tuesday. But by the time they followed the restless dog to the water’s edge, it was too late. 

 Ruby, 10, had adopted the mongrel two years ago and named it Sheroo. She used to go for a walk every afternoon with the dog. On Tuesday, while playing near the canal she slipped from the embankment and fell into the flowing water. The dog barked at a few passers-by and ran along the side trying to grab the struggling girl. 
 
 Sheroo then ran to the house and pulled Ruby’s mother by her dupatta, according to Rakesh, the girl’s father. Sensing something amiss, the parents followed the dog to the canal and found the girl unconscious further on. She was taken to   but by then she was already dead.
 
 Police say that Ruby’s body was handed over to the family members after an autopsy and was cremated on Tuesday evening. An inquest has been initiated to find out the cause of the girl’s death, but preliminary investigations suggest that girl slipped and fell into the water. Police, however, want to probe further before ruling out the possibility of foul play.
