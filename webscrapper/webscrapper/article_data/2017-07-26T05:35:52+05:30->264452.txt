NEW DELHI: Delhi   users will soon be able to   their travel smart cards through   or mobile application BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money).

 At present, only ICICI Bank account holders have the facility of recharging travel smart cards through SMS but   (DMRC) wants the facility to be extended to others as well.
 
 A DMRC spokesperson said that the corporation is soon going to float tenders to finalise an aggregator .
 
 To use the SMS facility, commuters will have to submit a mandate form with account details. The commuter can then send SMS to a designated number. The bank or aggregator will debit the bank account, and send a confirmatory message to the commuter and DMRC. Then, the commuter can visit any Metro station, show the smart   at an Add Value Machine (AVM) and complete the add value process.
