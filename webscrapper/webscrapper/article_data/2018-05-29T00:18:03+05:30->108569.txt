NEW DELHI: A 23-year-old bus driver was murdered and his body dumped in a pond in   on Saturday, allegedly by two friends of his  . The accused have been arrested.

 Shibesh Singh, DCP (Dwarka), said that Sunny (21) and Monu (22) were arrested and booked for   under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. The victim,   Singh, was a resident of Dawana village in Kurukshetra, Haryana, but had moved to   area a few months ago with his wife and her 14-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage.
 
 On Sunday, when she returned from a visit to her mother’s house, Padvinder’s wife found her husband was not at home. After some time she approached the cops.
 
 On Monday evening, cops found a body in a pond in Hastsal village. The semi-decomposed body was identified as that of Padvinder by his wife. The body was taken for autopsy, and the preliminary finding suggested death due to strangulation.
 
 CCTV footage recorded on Saturday in the area showed two men present with Padvinder. After identifying them as Sunny and Monu, police brought them in and questioned them. They eventually broke down and confessed to the bus driver’s murder.
 
 The men told police that they are friends of Padvinder’s stepdaughter. When she told them that her stepfather mistreated her, the pair wanted to punish him. On Saturday evening, they came to Padvinder’s house to find him looking for his step-daughter. They told him that she was at Hastsal and took him to the village. There, the youths thrashed him. They decided to let him go after this, but changed their mind and strangulated the man with a belt before throwing his body in a pond.
 
 The men initially told the cops they weren’t acquainted with Padvinder or the girl. They also claimed to be juveniles. These claims, however, were exposed as lies. Police officers said that they are now probing whether the girl too was involved in the crime, given that she was in Hastsal when the two men had arrived to confront her stepfather.
