NEW DELHI:   has decided to field SAD (Badal) candidate Manjinder Singh Sirsa on its party  , Lotus, in the upcoming by-election in   assembly constituency. The decision was taken on Monday despite, BJP pushing for its own candidate.

 Delhi BJP chief   and west Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma accompanied Sirsa to file his nomination on Tuesday. Tiwari said, “Though this is a single seat by-election, Sirsa’s victory will reflect people’s anger against Kejriwal government. We expect that the AAP candidate may even lose his security deposit.”
 
 The outcome of the by-elections, which is scheduled on April 9, will set the tone for the civic elections. BJP members said it will help gauge the mood in the city. “It is important to win this bypoll as it will give us a momentum in the upcoming civic elections,” said a party member.
 
 Riding high on its electoral victory in UP and Uttrakhand, BJP was pitching for a direct fight with AAP in the by-election. But its trusted ally SAD (Badal), which has been contesting from the seat since 2008, refused to relinquish its claim on the seat.
 
 For the past few days, senior leaders of both the parties have been meeting to finalise the candidate. BJP wanted their own candidate to contest. They said,the party has a better chance to win the seat due to ‘Modi wave’.
 
 Some BJP members are apprehensive that SAD (Badal)’s defeat in Punjab elections might have a negative impact. But Akalis is banking on its recent victory in the Delhi gurdwara elections. “It is a Punjabi-Sikh dominated seat. We won 35 out of 46 seats in the gurdwara polls. We will win with a huge margin,” said Manjit Singh GK, president of SAD (Badal)’s Delhi unit.
