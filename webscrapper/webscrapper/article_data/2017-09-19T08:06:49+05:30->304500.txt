PHAGWARA:  's   MLA Som   on Monday surprised the town's administrative officials by inaugurating the multi-storey parking at Banga road on Monday. 

 The officials watched the unscheduled inauguration helplessly as the ribbon was being cut by the MLA.
 
 Apparently, Parkash organized a ‘Tiranga Yatra' and invited local Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP leaders. Accompanied by former Markfed chairman   and district SAD unit president Sarwan Singh Kular, he started the ‘yatra' and reached the multi-storey parking, which was his pet project.
 
 After reaching there, as per the plan, they went to the first floor where the BJP workers stretched out a red ribbon and Parkash cut it.
 
 As officials learned about it, they rushed to the spot. Phagwara sub-divisional magistrate (SDM)   and other officials could do nothing but watch Som Parkash and other leaders inaugurate the facility.
 
 Meanwhile, SDM Jyoti Bala Mattoo said that it was not an inauguration. "A lot of work is still remaining. It would be opened for use after completion of the work and as per the instructions from the government,"she said. 
 
 SDM also pointed out that prohibitory orders under section 144 of CrPC are in force as no official permission was taken for the procession. Following this incident, Mattoo ordered to lock the upcoming auditorium at a different place apprehending that the inauguration drama could take place there as well. The multi-storey parking in Phagwara is the first in any sub-division of India.
