BENGALURU: Two unemployed men were arrested by   police, east Bengaluru on Sunday for allegedly   outside a restaurant in   recently.

 
 Police seized a scooter belonging to one of the accused. Ajay Hilori, deputy commissioner of police (east) claimed Billal Hussein, 23, and Ali Ahmed, 28, both residents of Nagarabhavi, west Bengaluru, “confessed to their crime”.
 
 The incident occurred on May 9, when the 23-year-old victim and a friend walked out of a restaurant on 80 Feet Road in Indiranagar at 2am. In his complaint, the woman’s friend alleged that two unknown people misbehaved with his friend. He claimed they were abused and pushed on the road. The strangers then fled on their scooter. He said the duo returned to follow them when he went to drop his friend home and again assaulted them with stones before fleeing.
 
 “We zeroed in on the accused with the help of CCTV footage,” a police officer said.
 
 The trigger for the assault and molestation, police said, was because the duo believed the techie and her friend had stared at them outside the restaurant. A heated argument that turned into an altercation broke out when the duo questioned the complainant for staring.
 
 “His friend intervened and in a fit of rage they pushed her too,” the duo reportedly told police.
 
 The cops initially refused to register a case citing election bandobust, and a case was finally registered on May 16. JB Nagar police claimed both places where the alleged incidents took place on May 9 did not fall in their jurisdiction. The first incident of assault and molestation occurred near   in Indiranagar which falls under the jurisdiction of Indiranagar police, they said.
 
 The second incident of stone pelting occurred in the jurisdiction of HAL police station. However, JB Nagar police traced and arrested the duo on directions of their superior officers.
 
 A probe is on to nab others who may have helped the accused to attack couple in HAL.
