Bharuch: Ten days after a 25-year-old lady teacher was murdered in Ankleshwar, the Bharuch local crime branch (LCB) arrested her cousin brother for the crime on Wednesday. On December 24, Meghna Gandhi, who worked with Vision International School located in Ankleshwar GIDC, was found murdered in her house at Rudraksh Residency on Valia Road. Her body was also burnt by the accused identified as Uday Satpute, a resident of Gotri Road in Vadodara. P N Patel, police inspector, Bharuch LCB said that Satpute reportedly had an affair with Gandhi. Her husband Chirag had gone to Ambaji with his friends for a few days. During this period, Satpute came to her house and picked up a quarrel with her. He accused her of having affairs with some other men in Vadodara. Following a heated altercation, he attacked her and she suffered severe injuries as her head hit the wooden bed. When Satpute realized that she had died, he took her body into the bed room, doused it with kerosene and set it ablaze in a bid to destroy evidence. After a detailed investigation and recording statements of Gandhiâ€™s family members and neighbours, police found the involvement of Satpute. An FIR was lodged on December 29 and Satpute was arrested from his house in Vadodara on Wednesday, Patel said.
