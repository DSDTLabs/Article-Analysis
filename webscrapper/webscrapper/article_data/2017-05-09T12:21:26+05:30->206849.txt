 “Satish and Kunal were quarrelling, while Bablu and Rohan tried to resolve the issue. After intervening, Kunal was asked to accompany Bablu and Rohan on their motorcycle. At this moment, Kunal’s friend came in and thought that his friend is in danger. They, hence, intervened and attacked Bablu and Rohan with sharp-edged weapons,” a police officer said.
 
 “Rohan managed to escape and saved his life, but Bablu was stabbed in the stomach and chest. Satish and his friends later took the injured duo to a private hospital where Bablu was declared brought dead. We are trying to find out the exact reason behind the attack,” he added.
