MANGALURU/UDUPI: Unhappy over the decline in   results, a   in  , a remote village in Byndoor taluk of   district, has commenced   for class X students.

 The special night classes commenced three months back, and only boys are allowed to attend. The school is situated 7 km from Byndoor, the taluk headquarters. This exercise commenced in November last year for SSLC students. The same was extended to class VIII and IX students in order to prepare themselves for the class X board exams.
 
 “The class X students are allowed to play outdoors from 5pm to 6pm, after which classes are held till 9pm,” said teachers, who themselves decided to stay back with the children in the night. 
 
 Currently, there are about 20 SSLC students including seven girls, who are enrolled in the school. Attending classes at night hasn’t been an inconvenience to the students, since they stay close to the school premises.
 
 Subrahmanya Maddodi, in-charge school head, said every year they are trying different techniques to improve results. “Over the years, it has resulted in a positive outcome. Last year, out of 14 students appearing for SSLC examinations, only one failed. This year, our aim is to hit the cent per cent mark,” he said.
 
 He said the night classes don’t concentrate only on academics. He said students are counselled on how to face exams without fear.
 
 Student Manoj said night classes have helped him to prepare well for examinations, as he can utilize time in the evening towards studies. “I come to night classes without anyone forcing me to do so, and it has helped me as well my classmates to perform better,” he adds.
 
 Parents point out that the effort is paying rich dividends. “They (students) are going to classes on their own, without us putting pressure on them.”
 
 Subrahmanya says girls are excluded since they are doing well academically, and also keeping in mind their safety, since the classes are held till late in the night.
