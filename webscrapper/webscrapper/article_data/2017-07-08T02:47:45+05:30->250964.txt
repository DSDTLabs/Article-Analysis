NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday expressed   over the failure to fully relocate industries away from   in the city. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar observed that continuing with the   in non-conforming or residential areas amounts to a violation of the Supreme Court’s directions against such practice.

 The court also made the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (DSIIDC) and North Delhi Power Limited ( ) as parties in the case and sought their response by August 10 on what action can be taken against the defaulting units. It said there is no reason for people who were allotted land in the industrial areas of Narela and Bawana on outskirts of the city to relocate their units to still continue to hold those plots, alloted by DSIIDC, despite not shifting to that place.
 
 The bench noted in its order that such industrial areas were set up by the government at a huge cost to the public exchequer. It said that non-shifting of the units to industrial areas was not only contempt of the apex court’s orders, but also punishable under the Delhi Municipal Corporations Act, IPC and the Criminal Procedure Code. The court also directed the corporation to carry out a fresh inquiry of the industries and inform the bench about the zone-wise details of the units within two weeks from July 6.
