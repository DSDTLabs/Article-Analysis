 Col Omed Singh, president, Sector 21 RWA, told TOI that the issue has been raised with the MCG several times. “This master sewerage line is serving five pockets in our sector and the population has increased in the locality in the past few years. To make things worse, an open drain of Dundahera (a nearby village) is also connected with the master sewerage line. The drain is not cleaned regularly, and thus overflows. We have been requesting the MCG to look into the issue for so many years. However, no action has yet been taken.”
 
 With population of over 8,000, the sector has only one 10-inch master sewerage line, according to residents. The overflowing sewage has also damaged roads in the sector apart from posing a health hazard to the residents.
 
 An MCG official pleading anonymity said the civic body is aware of the residents’ woes. “A team of MCG officials is already looking into the matter. The drains are cleaned regularly. It has happened only because of overflow from nearby areas,” said the official.
