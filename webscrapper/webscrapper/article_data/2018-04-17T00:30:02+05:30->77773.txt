MUMBAI: The   on Monday didn’t entertain a plea filed by two first-year students of   in Kandivli who sought their   to be regularized on  . 

 They had moved court based on relief given to three   who had major illness. Rui Rodrigues, counsel for Mumbai University, argued that the relief was granted in the NM College students’ case was only on exceptional grounds of major illness and accidents and these two students don’t fall under the exceptional category. The bench, headed by Justice Bhushan Gavai, agreed. Three more students have approached HC; their matter will be heard on Tuesday. 
 
 Last week, KES Shroff College debarred 104 first-year students for poor attendance. Though the university allows 75% attendance, the college relaxed it up to 60%. But these students did not even meet the minimum requirement. One of the students who moved court, in fact, has only 9-11% in some subjects, said a college official. It went up to 53% as the college offered her ‘grace’ attendance for participating in cultural events.
