AHMEDABAD: While the fee regulation issue for the current academic year has not been sorted out,   in Thaltej, emailed the parents of its students, asking them to submit post-dated cheques towards fees for the coming academic year. The email states that if these are not given by March 7, parents must give the school reasons why the child's admission ought to not be cancelled. 

 Baffled by the email, parents made a representation to the district education officer (DEO). They questioned the school's move to ask for post-dated cheques, when the issues pertaining to the current academic year are not yet cleared. The parents also alleged that fees for the coming academic year have been increased by more than 10%. They threatened to protest if the school does not withdraw its decision.
 
 "According to the   orders, we asked parents to pay fees for the first quarter of coming academic year" said  , trustee,   School.
