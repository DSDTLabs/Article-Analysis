HYDERABAD: Ahead of the  's 'Chalo Hyderabad' rally, planned on February 22,   held a   on Monday against state government's new rule on filling the 7,306 vacant posts in residential schools. Hundreds of students demonstrated in front of the district collectorate and   office in Hyderabad. 

 As per the latest norm, students have to secure minimum 50% in their degree courses to be eligible for the recruitment test held to fill these vacant positions. "The government is being unfair by setting up such eligibility criteria as it will make it difficult for rural students to appear for the recruitment test. Although chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao relaxed the eligibility percentage from 60 to 50, we demand that the system be abolished completely," said Ramesh Kota, president of the Students Federation of India (Telangana wing). The TJAC too has come out in support of the unemployed youth and termed the government's move as illegal. 
 
 Thousands of students are expected to participate in the 'Chalo Hyderabad' rally that will be held from Sundarayya Vignana Kendram at Baghlingampally to Indira Park, demanding that the government issues notification for all vacant posts in various government departments. "We will be at the forefront of the rally as we want the government to consider the plight of thousands of unemployed youth like me who have been waiting for these notifications since the state was separated," said Vinod Chary, a student leader.
 
 On Monday, protests also rocked Osmania University Arts College where members of the Unemployed Students Joint Action Committee sat on fast raising the same demands. "The state government has already betrayed the unemployed youth by not fulfilling the promise of releasing one lakh jobs. Now, by setting the mandatory norm of 50%, the government is curbing the unemployed youth's right to appear for such recruitment exams," said Manavatha Roy, president of the JAC.
