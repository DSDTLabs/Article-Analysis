THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Renjitha, the maid employed by professor Rajathankam to look after the ailing aunt of his wife Dr Jean Padma, looked frail. At times, she appeared to break down as she sat before a police officer at Sundara Bhavan, the house owned by Jean Padma’s brother Jose at  . Both the houses -- of   and her brother --were separated only by a wall.

 The deceased couple had employed two women, Renjitha and Dasamma, both hailing from Vellarada. Renjitha took care of Jean’s 70-year-old aunt Lalitha Jain, who was blind, and Dasamma looked after over 200 chickens in the house. According to Renjitha’s statement, when she returned from her village on Wednesday morning, all the family members were at home. They all had lunch together. In the evening, Cadell Jeanson Raja, the couple’s elder son, told Renjitha that his parents and sister left to Kanyakumari to visit a relative and she had no reasons not to believe him. The bedrooms of all the family members were on the first floor, where the maids were restricted entry.
 
 The last time she saw Lalitha was on Friday night when they had dinner together. On Saturday morning Cadell told her that Lalitha too had left to join others. Cadell also told Renjitha that she could sleep at his uncle’s (Jose) house, where the other maid stays, as nobody was home. But, soon the fire broke out.
 
 The women have told the police that the small axe, which the police suspect to be the weapon used to murder Lalitha, was used to kill the chicken. The police have also retrieved two machetes .
