ITANAGAR: Lok Sabha member from Arunachal East constituency   will stage a protest in front of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi inside the Parliament complex if the government fails to clear a project related to mobile connectivity for villages in Arunachal by August 14 this year. 

 In a letter to Prime Minister   on July 26, Ering said, "The delay in implementing the mobile connectivity project by BSNL is a matter of concern for the villagers of the state."
 
 Ering said the project, passed by the Cabinet in September, 2014, is among the first flagship programmes of the Modi government. Since then, people of the state have been waiting for completion of the project. 
 
 "However, the zeal is lacking at the bureaucratic level and all the good efforts of the PM are entangled in red tape," he wrote to Modi in the letter.
 
 Ering said as per the assurance given by minster for telecommunications Manoj Sinha, BSNL was supposed to give a purchase order to successful bidders in May, 2017. But the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) is yet to give its nod for the purchase and no headway has been made on the project. "I fail to understand the delay by USOF officials. Instead of giving its clearance, USOF officials are trying to delay and derail the project," said the Arunachal MP.
 
 On September 10, 2014, the Centre had approved a proposal to implement a comprehensive telecom development plan for the NE region. The project envisaged providing mobile coverage in 8,621 villages, installing 321 mobile tower sites along national highways and strengthening of transmission network in Arunachal, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim and Tripura.
 
 The estimated cost of the project was Rs 5,336.18 crore. For the project in  , tenders were floated and the names of successful bidders were announced. But since then, no progress has been made.
