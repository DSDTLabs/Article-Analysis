Actor   has a sure-shot way to make his children laugh - by putting his underwear on his head.

  
  
  "I think it's always amusing to put your underpants on your head," Grant, a father of four, told to the source.
 
 "My little girl, too, likes nappies on my head," he added.
 
 And although the   star, who will become a father for the fifth time soon, said that he too enjoys putting undergarments on his head. He notes that there has been one unfortunate consequence of this amusing behaviour.
 
 "I made the mistake of showing one of my sons my a** all the time. 'Hey, look at this!' Then he taught every single child in West London to do the same," he joked.
  
 Still Grant, who became a father for the first time in 2011, said having children is "the nicest thing that's ever happened to me".
 
 "It's just lovely to have all that love around. Suddenly you love someone more than yourself. It's unheard of in my case. And they love you, and it's all enchanting."
