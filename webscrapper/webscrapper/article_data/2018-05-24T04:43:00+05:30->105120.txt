GANDHINAGAR: The state government seems disinclined to reduce Vat and intervene in the sky-rocketing of petrol/diesel prices, though common people are extremely distressed by the price rise, and the entire economy is affected by the consequent increase in the costs of goods transport.

 Nitin  , deputy chief minister and state government spokesperson said on Wednesday, “Vat on   is our main income, even though we had reduced it earlier, which no state did.” The DyCM said further, “Local demand is increasing despite price hike. We are buying crude oil at high cost. I had given data in the state assembly earlier that our taxes on fuel are less than in many other states.”
 
 Patel declined to comment whether the state government is considering any reduction of Vat on   and diesel, even when reporters asked him to answer on the issue repeatedly. “The Union government’s petroleum minister is holding a meeting with companies and we expect some announcement,” Patel said.
 
 Patel pointed out, “Crude oil rates are increasing constantly at the global level.” tnn
