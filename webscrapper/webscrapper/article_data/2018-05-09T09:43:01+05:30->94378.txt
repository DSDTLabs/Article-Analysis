BENGALURU: As India’s e-tail slug fest intensifies,   has pumped Rs 2,600 crore into its main India unit — Amazon Seller Services — taking the total capital infusion into the entity to over Rs 10,750 crore in a little over a year.

 
 It signals the US e-tailer’s resolve to take on market leader  . The latter is set to be acquired by Walmart, a move that will give it a lot more financial and operational muscle.
 
 Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had made a commitment in 2016 to invest $5 billion into its Indian operations. To date, it has pumped in over Rs 22,390 crore in building infrastructure — it has 41 fulfilment centres across 13 cities in India now — acquiring new customers and growing its seller base. It has been aggressively trying to grow its smartphone, fashion and grocery categories. This has made India one of its biggest loss-making operations. Amazon’s international losses ballooned to over $3 billion in 2017, mainly on account of its Indian expenditures.
 
 On the contrary, Flipkart’s investments have been more modest. Though it has raised over $6 billion, it has so far invested under $2 billion.
 
 Amazon, to get a leg up over the local rival, has introduced its Prime and Alexa services at promotional rates and is said to be in the final stages of launching Prime Music and its audio book business Audible in the country. “India continues to be a good story for us...In fact, more Prime members joined India’s Prime programme in the first year than we’ve seen in any other country in the history of our world,” said Brian Olsavsky, CFO, Amazon, in an investor call.
