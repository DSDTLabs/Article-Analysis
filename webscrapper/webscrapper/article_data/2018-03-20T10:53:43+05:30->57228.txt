JAIPUR :   to a rapist of a 12-year-old, harassment at workplace and other women-related laws were the topic for discussion at the Legal Awareness Camp that was organised by Rajasthan Women Commission and Banasthali Vidhyapeeth. Suman Sharma, chairperson of Rajasthan Women Commission, was the speaker and answered queries of the girls, who raised questions related to the legal provision available for women. This was the 28th college covered by the commission to make women aware about their rights.

 She further said that during the discussions there had been questions about the misuse of law by women, to which she replied that laws nowadays are very strict about all this and if some someone misuses them then the matter will be dealt with strictly. “Women in India do not know about the basic provisions to file FIR and most of them have not even seen an FIR. These women are often harassed, even by the police officers due to their lack of legal knowledge. Such campaigns will make them alert about their legal rights so that they will not be exploited,” said Sharma.
 
 Rajasthan Women Commission has been organising such events across the state in schools and colleges. Even rural areas of Chomu, Sikar, Ramgarh have been covered in the campaign. There have been camps specifically for men to educate them about their responsibilities as the condition of women will not change until the attitude of men changes.
