TRICHY: Former chief minister J   may have lived for another 15 years, if she was given appropriate treatment, said state transport minister   at a party meeting in Karur on Thursday.

 He said that deteriorating health condition of Jayalalithaa was evident even on Independence Day, a month before she was hospitalised in September 2017.
 
 Accusing the   family of not providing her better treatment, he said that none of the ministers nor party men were allowed to see her. He was addressing a gathering of AIADMK cadre at   in Karur, where the disqualified MLA and former minister Senthil Balaji had addressed supporters a week ago.
 
 Vijayabhaskar who now holds charge of transport ministry, earlier held by Senthil Balaji, accused the latter of leaving the ministry debt-ridden. “None of the scheme that he now boasts to have introduced during his stint as minister was the schemes of Jayalalithaa. He did nothing but leave the ministry debt ridden,” he said. 
 
 Vijayabhaskar also accused Senthil of trying to curtail his growth during the early days of his political career. He asked party workers to believe Senthil Balaji’s words and switch loyalty to TTV faction.
