CUTTACK: As many as 1,082 students were booked in the state for malpractice in the   which concluded on Friday. 

 The   ( ), which conducts the examination, claimed the number of students booked for cheating is lowest this time. A   official said in the last five years, the figure of students booked for adopting unfair means while writing the matriculation examination has dropped significantly. In 2012, more than 10,000 students were booked for cheating by the Board's special squad, while this year the figure is only 1,082.
 
 "Despite a rise in the number of matriculation examinees each year, cases of malpractice are on the decline. It is a positive thing and it also reflects the fact that measures taken by us to check cheating are yielding desired results," said the BSE's controller of examination,  .
 
 Last year, 1,449 students were booked for malpractice across the state during the matriculation exam. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, the number of students booked for cheating was 8,490, 3,327 and 1,956 respectively. The BSE authorities also attribute the decline in cheating cases to a massive awareness drive carried out in schools for teachers and students across the state against cheating. Strict vigilance at exam centres and proper coordination between stakeholders are also responsible. "No untoward incident was reported from any part of the state. District administration and police cooperated with us fully in conducting the exam smoothly," said Mohanty. As a punitive measure, results of the students booked for malpractice will not be published this year and they will have to reappear for the examination next year.
 
 At least 6,08,659 students had appeared for the matriculation examination at 2,938 exam centres. As many as 99 squads were formed to check cheating. With the end of the exam, a carnival-like atmosphere was seen outside examination halls on Friday. Some students even played Holi.
