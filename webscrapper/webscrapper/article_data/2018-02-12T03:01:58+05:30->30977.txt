PANAJI: Two days after Goa town and country planning minister Vijai   called domestic tourists visiting the state as “scum of the earth” and refused to apologise for his remark,   chief minister Manohar Lal   called his Goa counterpart   on Sunday and lodged a strong protest against Sardesai’s remark. 

 Sardesai on Friday criticised his own government’s mass tourism policy and had said: “Today, we have almost six times the population coming into Goa. Those tourists are not the top-end tourists, but scum of the earth.” Sardesai’s words created a furore across the country and on social media. 
 
 Congress’ communication in-charge and Haryana MLA Randeep Surjewala put pressure on Khattar to demand Sardesai’s resignation or to accept that BJP was unable to protect the interests of the people of Haryana.
