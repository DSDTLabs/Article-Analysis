Ichha ( ) and Babble ( ) will finally get married in the coming month in  , which airs Monday – Friday at 8 pm on Sony SAB, but not before confusing the bride-to-be about it. Believing that Babble is getting married to his ex-lover,   is reluctant to participate in the wedding celebration.
Babble gets his name inscribed on Ichha’s palm during the mehendi ceremony, saying it’s a ritual to write the name of the groom on everyone’s hand. On the day of the sangeet ceremony, Babble and Ichha perform a romantic dance to Jag Ghumeya (Sultan). Actors from other shows also perform at the wedding — Aditi Sajwan and Paresh Ganatra from Chidiyaghar perform to Manma Emotion Jage (Diwale);   and Shubhi Ahuja from Y.A.R.O Ka Tashan groove to Beat Pe Booty (A Flying Jatt) and   (Ok Jaanu) and Abhishek Bajaj and Anju Jadhav from Dil Deke Dekho stage a sizzling performance to Kala Chashma (Baar Baar Dekho).
 Says Priyal, “I love wedding seasons and here, I am the one getting to be a bride. I love getting all dressed up and putting mehendi.”
 Mishkat adds, “This is a major highlight of the show. Finally, Babble and Ichha will get married. It was a lavish sangeet night, where all the actors from other shows were also part of the celebrations and gave mind-blowing performances.”
