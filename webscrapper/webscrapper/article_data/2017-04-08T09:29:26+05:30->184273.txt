PANAJI: Ponda-based director Aaditya Suhas   has won a national award for his debut Marathi film ‘Aaba Aiktaay Naa?’ (Aaba Are You Listening?) at the 64th National Film Awards. 

 The 25-year-old engineer turned filmmaker won the award for best direction in the non-feature film category. 
 
 The 28-minute fiction film, produced under the Shree Mahasala Productions, Ponda, explores the obsession of an old man towards a hearing aid machine and the way in which the newly-found sonic world changes his life forever. 
 
 Jambhale told  , “Our entire team was young and this was my first film. So we had to overcome many challenges. At the same time, we were fortunate enough to have lead actor, Arun Nalawade. Justin Jose K, our sound mixer, and the entire sound department in Mumbai also helped transform my vision,” Jambhale said.
