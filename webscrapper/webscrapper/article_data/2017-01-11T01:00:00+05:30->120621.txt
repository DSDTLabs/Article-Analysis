If all goes as planned,   will have a memorable Valentine’s Day. No, the actor is not likely to take off on a romantic holiday anytime soon. He will instead slip into   Dutt’s shoes. 

 Rajkumar Hirani’s biopic on Sanjay is expected to flag off on February 14. The plan currently is to shoot a couple of crucial scenes in Mumbai followed by schedules in other parts of the country.
 
 Last year, Raju had filmed Sanjay’s exit from   in Pune, with the idea of including it in the biopic. Over the last couple of weeks, the filmmaker and Ranbir have expedited their pre-production work. In fact, Ranbir has been spending plenty of time reading the script with Raju in his office. They were also seen at Sanjay’s house where he hosted a party on Raju’s birthday. Says a source close to the production, “Ranbir has already begun to work out and get his body in shape. He has been meticulous and extremely cautious about how he plays one of his favourite matinee idols. If everything stays as planned, we will roll on February 14.”
