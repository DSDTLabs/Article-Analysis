NEW DELHI: With an eye on the  ,   national convener and Delhi chief minister   is focusing his energies on strengthening the party unit in the neighbouring state. Kejriwal is likely to hold a roadshow on March 31, which will traverse at least half a dozen small towns in  . Among these will be Rohtak, Bahadurgarh and Bhiwani.

 The roadshow comes nearly a week after Kejriwal’s rally in   where had tried to strike an emotional chord with the people. “Kasam apni janmabhumi ki, Haryana mein agli sarkar AAP ki banegi aur jo kaam koi bhi party nahin kar payee, vo Kejriwal karega Haryana mein (I am taking a pledge at my birthplace that AAP will form the next government in Haryana and Kejriwal will do what other parties have failed in),” he had said in a 30-minute address.
 
 Naveen Jaihind, AAP’s Haryana convener, said Kejriwal would make several stops during the roadshow. “The roadshow will start in the morning and continue till the evening,” he said.
 
 As Delhi is not a full state, the AAP government has been involved in a continuous power tussle with the Centre and LG. Party sources said it now wished to find a foothold in a full state where the government had greater liberty. In this context, AAP is looking at Haryana due to its proximity to Delhi with which it shares three borders. The party aims to hardsell its Delhi model of governance where it has focused on education and health, besides providing free water and cheaper electricity. 
 
 A large number of Haryana population — rural and urban — is employed in Delhi. The party expects them to influence public opinion back in their home state. 
 
 The existing power houses in Haryana, however, pose a significant test for AAP’s ambition. BJP, Indian National Lok Dal and Congress have a strong presence in the state. AAP did not contest the 2014 assembly polls in Haryana and its performance there in the Lok Sabha elections was also below expectations.
