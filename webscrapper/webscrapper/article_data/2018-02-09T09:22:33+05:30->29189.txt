VIJAYAWADA: The people and political parties of   responded as one to the bandh call given by the Left parties over the issue of meagre allocation for the state in the  , resulting in a complete and peaceful shutdown across the 13 districts on Thursday.

 The bandh was supported by the YSR Congress,   and Jana Sena, but the   and BJP, the ruling parties in the state, too gave their tacit support. While the TDP was vocal in its participation, with some of its leaders tonsuring their heads and others leading protest marches, the top   state leaders chose to remain in the background. Local party committees, however, were given a free hand to actively take part in the bandh.
 
 
  
  
 
 In all the major cities in the state, including the capital region of Vijayawada and Guntur and Visakhapatnam in the north coastal region,   buses stayed off the roads. Commercial establishments and educational institutions remained shut for the day, with the only exception being medical shops and a few eateries.
 
 In all the cities and towns, protesters took out rallies and were not stopped or arrested by the police, who were present in considerable numbers across the state. While tonsuring of the heads was meant to be a symbolic protest, some others took to seek alms with their begging bowls to convey the point that the lack of allocations has reduced Andhra Pradesh to go around with a begging bowl.
 
 The situation was similar in Vizag and the rest of north coastal Andhra, with the bandh bringing normal life to a complete halt. A few leaders of YSR Congress Party were arrested in Srikakulam. On the whole, barring a few arrests, the bandh was peaceful and total across the state.
