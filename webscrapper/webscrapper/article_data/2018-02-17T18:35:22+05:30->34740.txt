MUMBAI:   has offered Rs 35,000 crore to the lenders of   as well as a 12% equity stake in the beleaguered company. With this, the Tata Group’s flagship company has emerged as the lead bidder for the debt-laden alloy maker that is going through bankruptcy proceedings, according to a source familiar with the matter. Tata Steel’s offer has trumped rival   Steel’s bid of Rs 29,700 crore. Bhushan Steel has a debt of Rs 50,000 crore, of which it owes Rs 44,000 crore to lenders.

 The liquidation value of Bhushan Steel, which has a capacity of 5 million tonnes, was placed at Rs 15,000 crore. According to current rules, any entity willing to bid for the company has to put in an offer that is higher than the liquidation value.
 
 While several parties initially showed interest in bidding for Bhushan Steel, it later narrowed down to just two entities: Tata Steel and JSW Steel. For Tata Steel, the acquisition of Bhushan Steel will help in strengthening its grip over the Indian metal market where demand for the alloy is predicted to triple to 300 million tons per annum by the end of the next decade. The deal will also aid in scaling up the capacity of Tata Steel, which has been pushed from the top slot by JSW Steel in India.
 
 With its fortunes slipping in the European steel market through Corus, Tata Steel has sharpened its focus on the home market and has been looking at distressed assets to add to its capacity. The buyout of Bhushan Steel will mark the first purchase under Tata Group chairman  , who has been until now selling off unprofitable assets like the consumer mobile services business.
 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Bhushan Steel’s losses widened to Rs 1,603 crore. Its loss during the same period of fiscal 2017 was Rs 743 crore. Bhushan Steel’s promoter Neeraj Singhal owns about 58%, but more than 70% of his stake has been pledged with financial creditors. On Friday, Bhushan Steel’s stock closed 3.4% lower at Rs 45 on the BSE.
