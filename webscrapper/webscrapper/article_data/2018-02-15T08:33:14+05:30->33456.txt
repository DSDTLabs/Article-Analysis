AMRITSAR: The Independent Students’ Federation (ISF) has filed a complaint against comedian-actor   for allegedly violating traffic norms during his recent visit to Amritsar. Its president Keshav Kohli in a complaint lodged with police alleged that during his recent visit to Amritsar, Kapil was overspeeding on a   motorcycle without a helmet.

 He said Kapil was a local resident and a role model for millions of his fans and should have obeyed traffic norms. In the video, viral on net, Kapil is seen driving a Bullet motorcycle wearing a cap while recalling his old memories of Amritsar’s Ranjit Avenue market, where he had spent his childhood. Earlier in 2016, nurses in Amritsar had also filed a complaint against Kapil for showing them in bad light in his TV show.
 
 Amritsar DCP   said the police had received a complaint from the federation and would begin investigation. “We will investigate and if some violation of law is noticed, then we will take legal action,” he said.
 
 Kohli said Kapil had brought pride to the city but with success on his side, he should have been equally responsible. He further said Kapil’s relatives were also in Punjab police, so he should have been more careful.
 
 The ISF had earlier been in news in 2017 after its members had removed ‘chadar’ from the grave of great grandfather of Pakistan’s former PM Nawaz Sharif at his native village Jati Umra, near Amritsar, in protest against Pakistan government’s denial to identify Indian prisoner Nanak Singh in its jail.
