MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday sought a hearing before the   pointing out that the Raigad collectorate has sealed the port. The HC will hear the matter on Wednesday.

 The collector sealed the port last Friday, said Dighi port officials, even as the port was now complying with orders in an earlier public interest litigation to provide water to four  . 
 
 A bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Girish Kulkarni said Dighi Koli Samaj Mumbai Rahivasi Sangh, which had filed the   in 2009, has to be represented by its lawyer Ram Mendhadkar before the Dighi Port Ltd can be heard for any relief in removing the  . The collector has to be heard too, said the court, as it suggested that the port first pay the outstanding dues for a water scheme for the villages affected by the construction of the private port. The bench said the port must also comply with supplying 100   daily to four villages as assured by it in an undertaking given in 2011.
 
 On April 25, the HC, which heard villagers of Dighi, Nanavali, Maneri and Karlas who said that the port was not supplying water as promised, issued a contempt notice against the collector as well as the port. The court had, earlier on April 7, directed both the   and superintendent of police to ensure that 100 water tankers reach the four villages, failing which they should take “necessary steps to stop the functioning of the port”.
 
 The port, on Tuesday, through senior counsel Janak Dwarkadas and Harinder Toor, said it would comply with the court directions. It added that the seal was causing a loss to the port. The high court bench said, “let the port first deposit the money and provide water...There has been no compliance for four years.”
