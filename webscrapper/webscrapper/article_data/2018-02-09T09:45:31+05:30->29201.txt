HYDERABAD: Power demand in Telangana is set to reach an all time high with all sectors being covered under the 24-hour supply system for the first time. On Thursday, the daily peak demand touched 9,650 MW against the normal of 7,600 MW. 

 Maximum power consumption takes place during the rabi season due to increase in day temperatures as well as the demand from the farm sector. 
 
 
  
  
 
 The day consumption is all set to cross 10,000 MW in a week or 10 days, said Telangana   officials. "We already met the highest demand of 9800 MW last August. In the coming days, it may cross 10,000 MW or even more. At present, we have been providing   to   are underway. Without imposing any cuts on the other sectors, we have been supplying 24-hour power to them," D  , CMD of Transco and   told TOI.
 
 With daily demand rising, discoms are making all efforts to meet any eventuality.

This has enabled Telangana to procure power from any part of the country. The state has already tied up to buy 2,000 MW from the power-surplus Chhattisgarh, but is availing only 1,000 MW per day.
 
 "We will take more power through Wardha line if needed. The power is available and a call away," said Transco officials.
 
 In the next three years, the state is all set to add power capacity of 18,500 MW to the grid.
