NEW DELHI: The warring factions of the   led by   and his son   have reasonable time to settle their issues and save the party symbol “cycle” from being frozen as the   on Tuesday fixed January 13 as the date of hearing.

 EC sources said it wants to settle the matter before January 17 when the process of nomination begins for the first phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh to be held on February 11, provided the two sides proceed accordingly. “Notices are being sent to both factions for the January 13 hearing,” a source said.
 
 The Commission had no option but to hear the two factions as Akhilesh camp has submitted affidavits signed by SP MPs, MLAs, MLCs and delegates supporting chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, the other side has maintained that as per the party’s constitution, Mulayam Singh Yadav is still the party chief. Akhilesh camp has filed papers over one lakh in number and it will be Herculean exercise for the Commission to scrutinise them. Mulayam faction has already questioned authenticity of the papers and has requested scrutiny.
 
 The ‘cycle’ symbol faces the threat of being frozen before the seven-phase UP elections if the Commission is not able to decide which of the two factions of the party commands majority in the organisation. Experts have indicated that since there is not much time left for the assembly elections, Commission has limited option of allotting separate symbols to the two factions and freeze the existing one.
 
 The side which has the support of majority (50% plus 1) of MPs, MLAs, MLCs and delegates will gain an upper hand in the fight to control the party founded 25 years ago. As three days are left for the hearing, possibility of timely truce is not ruled out mainly after Mulayam and Akhilesh sat together for more than one-and-half hours together.
