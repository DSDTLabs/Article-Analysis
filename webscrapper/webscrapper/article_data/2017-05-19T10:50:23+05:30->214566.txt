CHANDIGARH: As many as 35 Indian soldiers were killed in UN peacekeeping operations across the world during the last 17 years. Most number of fatal battle causalities has been in Congo, with the toll highest between 2010 and 2015.

 Bathinda-based RTI activist HS Grewal, who procured the information under RTI Act, 2005, from the ministry of defence, rued that many of these Indian soldiers killed abroad do not get the recognition they deserve.

 In Congo, the causalties include Indian troops deployed as peacekeepers in the   in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).
