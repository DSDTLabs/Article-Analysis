HYDERABAD: Special Operations Team (SOT), Rachakonda, along with Saroornagar police have arrested three people for transporting narcotic substances from Goa to Hyderabad and other cities. They also seized 15 LSD blots, 10 amphetamine tablets and 1kg   from their possession.

 Police nabbed Katepally Ganesh Kumar, 27, an IT professional and resident of Hi-Tec City, Shaik Ahmed, 21, from   and  , 18 from  , both auto drivers. Two others—Aravind Reddy and Arbid Mir— were arrested by excise and Goa police.
 
 Ganesh, Aravind and their other friends visit Goa frequently. They got in touch with a local drug dealer, Arbid Mir.
 
 Mir, who was arrested by Goa police, had earlier requested Ganesh and Aravind to supply him ganja for ₹15,000 in exchange for hard drugs like LSD and amphetamine as it was difficult to get the weed in Goa.
 
 The duo then started procuring ganja from agency areas of Visakhapatnam and Khammam and supplying it to Mir. They in turn collected cocaine, LSD blots, amphetamine tablets and MDMA from their partner.
 
 A few weeks ago, Aravind was apprehended by excise police and drugs were seized from his possession. Since then, Ganesh and Mir were absconding.
 
 On a tip-off, Ganesh’s other associates Ahmed and Rasheed, who came to supply 1kg ganja, were arrested at Saroornagar on March 15.
 
 On Tuesday, Ganesh was arrested by Rachakonda police, while Mir was arrested by the anti-narcotic cell of the Goa police.
