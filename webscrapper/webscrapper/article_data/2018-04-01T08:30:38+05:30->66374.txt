AMRITSAR: Family members of late Pakistani advocate Awais Sheikh have formed a foundation to further his legacy of humanitarian work by helping prisoners of India and   lodged in each other’s country and promoting people-to-people contact between the countries.

 Talking from Stockholm on Saturday, his son   Khan (34), a social entrepreneur, said that the family was in process of registration of the Awais Sheikh Memorial Foundation in Sweden, through which they would continue his father’s work on a global scale. An advocate and a rights activist, Awais, who had contested Indian prisoner Sarabjit Singh’s case, had died in   on March 26 morning. The body was buried on March 28.
 
 Khan said that the headquarters of the foundation would be in Sweden, which would be managed by him, his sister Mehkar Sheikh and brother-in-law   while the New York-based regional offices would be managed by his niece   and brother Haroon Sheikh, respectively. He said that the family was still working on the modalities of the foundation and might also partner with other Sweden-based NGOs, which were already working in the conflict zones across the globe.
 
 “We also have members and partner organizations in India and Pakistan,” he added. Shahrukh said that one of the major aims of the foundation would be to provide relief to the Indian and Pakistani prisoners lodged in both countries. “We are working on to procure the number and other details of Indian prisoners lodged in Pak jails and vice-versa. We also have some data procured by my father on the subject,” he said.
 
 He further said that the foundation would work for the rights of prisoners of both countries, facilitating meetings of prisoners with their families and promote exchange of delegations of artists, students and peace activists between the two nations.
