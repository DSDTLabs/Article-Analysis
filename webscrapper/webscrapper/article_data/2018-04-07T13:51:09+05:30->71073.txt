CHARMINAR: An open electricity transformer and dangling electric wires pose serious threat to residents in  . To make things worse, the place has been turned into a dumping yard with some residents dumping waste in and around the open space near the transformer.

 Locals said the Telangana   authorities have not erected fence around the transformer, despite repeated requests. One of the shopkeepers told TOI that the transformer installed at ground level without fencing is a huge security risk. “The dangling cables pose a serious threat to locals. Many a times, I happen to see children coming and going along that side, which is dangerous. I tell passerbys to avoid walking near the transformer. The authorities have failed to address the issue,” said Jabber, a shopkeeper.
 
 Some residents complained that the matter was brought to the notice of concerned authorities and they even requested the authorities to erect a fence around the transformer, but the authorities have turned a blind eye. “No one seems to be serious enough to address public grievances. If someone fails to pay the electricity bill then they rush to cut the connection, but when it comes to addressing our problems, they don’t do anything,” complained  , a resident.
 
 Angry residents urged Transco to take serious note of the problem and fix it.
