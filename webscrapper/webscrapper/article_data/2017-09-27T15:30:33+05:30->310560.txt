MOHALI: The Greater   Area Development Authority (GMADA) has decided to close the gap in the median by installing crash barriers on   road. Chief administrator of   Ravi Bhagat directed chief engineer Sunil Kansal to prepare the estimates and get the plan sanctioned from the additional chief administrator (ACA).

 The decision came after TOI highlighted the illegal gaps in the median just a few meters before the controversial gurdwara on the airport road. This is the same gap through which a speeding Verna car had jumped to the other side of road and rammed head on with a truck, killing the driver of the car.
 
 When TOI discussed the problem with Bhagat, he in a swift action directed the officers concerned to get the gap closed. He stated that, “It is really surprising that none of our officers took cognizance of the gap in the median and closed it. I will ensure that all such illegal openings are closed wherever they are in Mohali.”
 
 People are seen crossing to the other side through the gap in their cars and two wheelers just to avoid travelling an extra mile and burning fuel to reach Sector 70 from the Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan side. The 200-foot wide road sees high-speed moving traffic and such median jumpers risk their lives just to avoid travelling some extra distance.
 
 Chief engineer, GMADA, Sunil Kansal said that, “We have decided to install crash barriers to close the gap on the median instead of putting up railings. These crash barriers act as natural cushion, which reduce the impact of crash and prevent vehicles from crossing over the median and hitting an oncoming vehicle on the other side. The work can be initiated on short-term tenders.”
