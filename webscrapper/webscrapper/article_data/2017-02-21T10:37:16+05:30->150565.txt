CHENNAI:   B Sathyanarayanan was in for an unpleasant surprise when he entered Jeeva Park for a   on Monday. More than 25 fellow walkers gathered around the legislator and fired a barrage of questions at him for joining hands with acting AIADMK general secretary  . The MLA, who was caught on camera saying he enjoyed his stay at the Golden Bay resort in Koovathur, was at a loss for words and left immediately after the crowd was done venting at him. 

 “It was a heated argument that went on for half-an-hour,” said one of the walkers who did not want her identity to be revealed. “When they wanted our votes, they came to our doorstep, so why didn’t they consult us before choosing sides? None of us want a Sasikala-run government. We are really upset and angry, so as soon as we saw him, we confronted him.” 
 
 Sathyanarayanan later told TOI that people must view Sasikala’s conviction and the government as separate issues. “People asked me why I supported Chinnamma but this is Amma’s government and we can’t let it be dissolved,” said the first-time MLA.
 
 “Had the party split, we would have had President’s rule or fresh elections for which the situation isn’t right. It doesn’t matter who is chief minister. We want Amma’s government to continue and I want to continue doing my duty for the people of T Nagar. If I’m not doing my work, let people question me,” said Sathyanarayanan, adding that he would continue going for his regular morning walks to the park.
