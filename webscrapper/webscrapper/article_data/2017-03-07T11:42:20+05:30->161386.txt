HYDERABAD: With   (UIDAI) linking all transactions to Aadhaar, including cashless transactions, even   in different categories are applying for Aadhaar in droves. Hence, authorities have decided to relax norms for people who cannot get their Iris or finger prints authenticated in the  .

 “If someone is visually impaired, print of all 10 fingers will be used to issue the unique ID. If a person has lost his hands, scan of the retina will do. We believe there is nobody who is blind and has lost both hands. But if such a case comes to the fore, we will have to see what can be done,“ said  , deputy director general of UIDAI, Hyderabad.
 
 Though the data related to the people who availed exemption cannot be revealed, officials say that such cases are about one percent of overall enrolment in the state. UIDAI has not begun any separate process in other states, but officials here have gone to rehabili tation homes to find out about people living with disabilities.“We took the certificate from resident officers and did the enrolment for those who are at homes. We have also given biometric exemptions,“ officials said.
 
 In rare cases, where people are bedridden permanently, officials have begun sending kits to their houses for enrolment.
