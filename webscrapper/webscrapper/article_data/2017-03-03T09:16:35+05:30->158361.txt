BENGALURU: The M Chinnaswamy stadium may well be Indian coach  's backyard, but the Australians have also enjoyed a good success rate at the venue. With just one loss in their previous five Test encounters at the venue,   and his men could not have asked for a better ground to go for a 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Although none of the present crop of players have played a Test here, they all take heart from the team's impressive record.

 Allrounder   admitted that the thought of a good run at one of Australia's favourite hunting grounds in India has crossed their mind. “Yes, that's something we've spoken about as a group. Although none of us have played here we want to continue our winning ways at this ground. Hopefully that'll be the case in six days' time.”
 
 On the Bengaluru pitch, Marsh said the strip looks good. “It looks like a reasonably good wicket. Pretty dry and there's a few cracks already. But we try not to read too much into the actual wicket. At the end of the day, it's 22 yards and both sides have got to bat and bowl on it. It's about preparing as best we can.”
