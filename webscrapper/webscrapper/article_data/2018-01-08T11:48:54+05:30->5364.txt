MARGAO: With beef shops in the state remaining shut for the second consecutive day, some ministers have decided to take up the issue with chief minister   on Monday.

 Availability of fresh meat was hampered as Goa Meat Complex (GMC), the government-run abattoir, has been shut for three months, while traders have refused to import beef from   alleging harassment from cow vigilantes.
 
 Minister for animal husbandry Mauvin Godinho and   minister Vijai Sardesai are expected to speak with the chief minister in resolving the beef issue. BJP’s Calangute MLA Michael Lobo has also called for efforts to resolve the issue at the earliest.
 
 Many enquiries are being made by restaurants and hotels for availability of beef as demand is still high, said a beef trader.
 
 For the second consecutive day, caterers across Goa lamented that the beef shortage during their peak business period of weddings and other functions like first holy communion parties, etc, was causing severe hardships and forcing them substitute their menus.
 
  of Menezes Caterers, Chinchinim said, “I receive orders on a daily basis. Fortunately, I had sufficient stock today, but I am not sure how I will manage tomorrow as I had to replace some beef items with chicken dishes.”
 
 “Menus are chosen in advance. However, considering the present predicament, some clients are willing to accept chicken dishes as substitutes while others are opting to cancel the beef items altogether,” said another caterer.
