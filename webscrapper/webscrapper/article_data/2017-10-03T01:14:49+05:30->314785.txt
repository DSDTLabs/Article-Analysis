NEW DELHI: If the trends of adjournments and their duration are any indication to go by, consumers are in for a long haul while fighting cases in state consumer commissions.

 According to details accessed from the government’s computer networking of consumer foras (CONFONET), the period of adjournment in Delhi is the maximum at an average of more than four months. Barring a few states/UTs including Goa, Puducherry and Chandigarh, the average adjournment period in almost all other state consumer commissions is more than a month. Even the average adjournment period in the country’s apex consumer commission-   ( )— it is over three months.
 
 “In certain cases, the next date of hearing is put after six months. There are at least 5-6 hearings for each case and going by this trend of long adjournments, you can imagine how the process of justice is getting delayed,” said  , a consumer activist, who has started an online petition to push for quicker processing of cases and urgent filling of vacancies in these commissions.
 
 Delay due to long adjournments defeats the whole purpose of consumer fora, which were created specially under the Consumer Protection Act, said Anil  , another consumer activist.
 
 “These have become like normal courts. The procedures are complicated and lengthy, processes are cumber some. These commissions have become parking place for retired persons. Most of the members don’t want to work and the condition of these commissions is worse while posts of members are lying vacant for months,” Sood alleged.
 
 Even a former member of a state commission admitted that many of the members are “simply spending time while occupying posts”. NCDRC has three vacant posts of members for more than a year.
 
 Former NCDRC member Justice J M Malik said the governments need to give members a tenure of 10 years.
