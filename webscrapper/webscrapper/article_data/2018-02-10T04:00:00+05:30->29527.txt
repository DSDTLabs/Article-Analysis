Surat: A 3 km walkway constructed for the people to also feel energized by morning and evening walks from Athwalines Chowpaty to Taj Hotel at Parle Point along river Tapi was cleaned up in many years by the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) staffers on Friday.  BJP MLA Harsh Sanghvi had alleged in MLA coordination meeting with SMC officials that the walkway had become unusable because of the filth and in the absence of streetlights.  He alleged that anti-social elements had usurped the walkway. He demanded that either SMC conduct daily cleaning or destroy the walkway so that anti-social elements don’t convert it into their adda.  “People are prepared to spend money to maintain this walkway. We would make it beautiful. However, we can’t let it become a den of anti-social elements,” Sanghvi said. The walkway, which was constructed in 2012 at a cost of Rs 3 crore, can benefit at least 50,000 citizens of Athwalines, Parle Point and Umra village. They can spend their morning and evening time here by walking and energizing themselves. Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “We have got the walkway cleaned up today itself. We will look for a private partner to maintain it.”
