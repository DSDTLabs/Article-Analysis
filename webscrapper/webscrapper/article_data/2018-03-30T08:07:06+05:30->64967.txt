NEW DELHI: The last occasion an Australian captain let his emotions get the better of him was 34 years ago, though under completely different set of circumstances.

 
 
 
 Kim Hughesâ€™ tearful resignation at The Gabba in November 1984 is still talked about. Hughes was a wonderfully elegant batsman but as captain, found himself increasingly isolated in the Australian dressing room as captain as his form deserted him in a dreadful West Indies tour. At a press conference in Brisbane on November 26, 1984, he began to read out a statement. 
 
 
 
 "The constant speculation, criticism and innuendo by former players and sections of the media have taken their toll. In the interest of the team, Australian cricket and myself, I have informed the ACB of my decision to stand down as Australian captain." 
 
 However, he could not go on with his statement with tears rolling down his cheek and sobs shaking him up. He got up and handed the statement to the team manager and left the room. Bob Merriman, the manager finished reading the text. In the 1983-84 tour of West Indies, Hughes-led Australia lost 3-0. Back in Australia, West Indies won the first two Tests and the antagonism within his team.
