The Delhi Public School, Nacharam, held the con vocation ceremony of the third batch of `early childhood care and education' (ECCE) on July 7.

 The ECCE course was conducted by   (PEMSL) in collaboration with   of Teacher Education. Explaining the objection of the course, T Sudha, director of   said, “The course is one of the brain child programmes of M Komariah. His vision is to empower women (of any age group varying from 19-65 who passed their class XII and above) who are loving and caring individuals with basic instinct of mothers to earn while they learn (like  's basic education).“
 
 While giving the key note, Dr Anil Kundra emphasized on the need for ECCE not just in foreign countries but also in India. “Children have lost their childhood because of busy schedules of parents and thus, the teachers of pre-primary have the responsibility of not only a mother but also a loving and caring human being nurturing the wellrounded personality of the future citizen,“ said Kundra, adding that teachers should not restrain the inbound talent of the child.
 
 The candidates of the third batch expressed their reflections on the course. The course enabled them to deal with their own wards with better understanding of psychological aspects and engage them effectively after the course. Some who joined the course expressed their learning was fructified at school and home and asked candidates of the fourth batch to certainly take up the course to be identified as super mothers.
