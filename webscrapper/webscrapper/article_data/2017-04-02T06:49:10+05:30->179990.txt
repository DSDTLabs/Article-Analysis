Kolkata: If you buy a two-wheeler, or get one delivered, on Sunday, it will come with the Automatic Headlamp On (AHO) feature. In compliance with the ministry of road transport and highways’ notice, bikes and scooters will now have to keep   on even during the day.

 The   ensures that the headlamps get switched on as soon as the  . “This is a safety measure. It has been ascertained that it is easier to spot two-wheelers with headlamps on even in bright sunlight. The AHO feature is also important during dusk, dawn and inclement weather when visibility falls. In case   makers can’t install the AHO feature, they should incorporate Daytime Running Lights (DRL) used by cars in many countries. The lights need to be bright enough to be visible to oncoming traffic,” said a ministry official from New Delhi.
 
 Two-wheeler users, however, say that there is bound to be confusion with only some vehicles having the AHO feature. “What if the police start enforcing the headlamp rule? We will have to switch on our headlamps after starting our motorcycles and then remember to switch them off every time we turn off the ignition. Why can’t the government ask the firms to take back our vehicles and fit them with AHO?” asked motorcycle enthusiast Santanu Roy. 
 
 Others complained that there hasn’t been any campaign to raise awareness among two-wheeler users about this rule. “If the government is so concerned about accidents, there should be a uniform law. Even if we were to keep our headlamps on throughout the day and remember to switch them off and on whenever we stop, it would take a heavy toll on our batteries,” said biker Ramesh Thakur. 
 
 Several people, though, have hailed this initiative. They pointed out that many countries have already adopted this policy and the rates of accidents have come down there. “People need not be so concerned. They can get DRLs fitted on their motorcycles or scooters for a few hundred rupees,”said a biker.
