BENGALURU: Animal husbandry minister A   denied any involvement in the transfer of Hassan deputy commissioner  , which was subsequently stayed.

 Reacting to former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda’s allegation, Manju said on Thursday: “He (Gowda) is an old man, so he will talk whatever comes to his mind. But that doesn’t mean he can make baseless allegations against me. Gowda is indebted to me as he wanted my help to win the   seat.’’ Manju said he will soon reveal the real reasons behind Rohini’s transfer bid and expose those demanding commissions from civil works. To Gowda’s poser whether the minister wanted a commission even for holy work (preparations for Mahamastabhishekha of Lord  ), Manju said during the same event in 2006, a road was constructed to the venue. “Gowda’s son H D Revanna was PWD minister. Does it mean he also took a percentage to complete the work?” Manju asked.
