MUMBAI: The CBI has booked additional commissioner of income tax Vivek Batra and his wife in a disproportionate assets case. 

 They are accused of amassing Rs 6.8 crore. This is the second case against Batra in the last 12 years. Batra is in charge of the tax deduction at source unit. 
 
 In September 2010, the CBI had arrested Batra and later released on bail. The CBI had filed a chargesheet against him in the case in 2012, but he challenged the finance departmentâ€™s decision to grant prosecution sanction against him on the CBI request. The apex court rejected his appeal. The trial is pending before the court. 
 
 The CBI booked Batra, his wife, a chartered accountant, the MD and director of two private companies in the case. Batra allegedly amassed assets worth Rs 6.8 crore and the other accused are said to have helped him to park the black money. The CBI alleged that he acquired these assets while working in the I-T department during 2008 to 2017. His wife Priyanka is a fashion designer and also acted in some television serials.
 
 On Friday, the CBI raided premises belonging to Batra and other accused in Mumbai, Delhi, Thane, Goa, Silvassa and Karnal. They collected several documents for examination.
 
 In 2005, Batra was booked by the CBI in a disproportionate assets case. He was accused of amassing Rs 1.27 crore between 1993 to 2004. CBI officials said through benami transactions he had invested the money in the name of his wife and minor son in two companies. 
 
 He was suspended from the service after his arrest in 2010 but managed to return.
