VADODARA: Residents of Sonianagar in Chhani Jakatnaka area of the city and those from   in   held separate protests at the   ( ) headquarters on Friday regarding the proposed housing schemes in these areas. The settlements are to be razed to develop housing schemes for the urban poor there.

 The Sonianagar residents are opposing the project on the grounds that they had been given allotment letters several years back. They also claimed that the land on which they had settled fell under the Urban Land Ceiling Act. The residents stated that the government was regularising settlements on such plots and even they should benefit from it. They have also sought help to build houses on the existing plots with aid under the Pradhan   (PMGY).
 
 Sanjaynagar residents have raised a series of demands including higher rents after their settlement was razed. They have demanded that if this could not be done, the VMC should provide alternative accommodation till work on the Sanjaynagar housing scheme was completed after razing their dwellings. The residents also demanded that the razing drive should be conducted only after monsoon.
