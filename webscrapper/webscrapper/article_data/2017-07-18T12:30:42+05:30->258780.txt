NOIDA: Four days after a video clip surfaced in which a mongrel was seen being suffocated to death by a man in a traffic policeman's uniform, the police have nabbed the 48-year-old accused Dhan Singh. He worked as a traffic marshal with the Noida Police.

 The brutal killing of the dog is reported to have occurred near Sadarpur Bazar in Sector 45, on July 14.
 
 Earlier, Humane Society International (HSI), an animal protection organisation, and Fauna Police, a local animal rights organisation, had jointly offered a reward of Rs 50,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of the person who strangled the stray dog.
 
 A traffic policeman told TOI that the suspect was off duty when the crime took place. "The accused had gone to buy vegetables when a stray dog barked at him. In self-defence, the traffic marshal stepped on the dog. Just then some onlookers in the market told him not to let go of the animal as it was a mad dog and it would bite him," he said.
 
 The stagger of the accused indicated he was drunk and in that state he refused to take his foot off the dog's neck till the animal died.
 
 Abhinandan, circle officer 1, said that a case has been registered against the accused. “We have started legal procedure into the matter. We will prepare a charge sheet and produce in court,” he said.
