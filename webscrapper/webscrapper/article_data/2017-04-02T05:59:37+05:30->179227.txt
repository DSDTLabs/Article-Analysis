RANCHI: The state government’s order to clamp down on   and slaughterhouses across the state have thrown open a new   of mutton and chicken in the state capital.

 A mutton shop in Morabadi and Ratu Road and a few   in Dipatoli area continued selling popular meat items from their backdoor. Even though shutters were down in most of the shops, there were ‘attendants’ to cater to potential buyers.
 
 “How much do you want, keep change of exact amount and wait..” came instruction from one of the attendants outside a shop. He went inside to bring a dressed chicken in a colourful polythene bag. “We are not using   bags because they are easily identified,” said a mutton seller who didn’t wish to be quoted.
 
 The sellers haven’t increased the rates of meat in the black market. Mutton was available for Rs 440 a kilo whereas chicken was sold for Rs 130-150 for every kiogram. “We still have old stock left and unless we buy goats and chicken at higher prices why should be cheat out customers,” asked a seller.
 
 Many customers, however, said that they felt being cheated in terms of quality and weightwhile buying meat from the backdoor. 
 
 “Buying mutton and chicken from unauthorised places is our choice so we cannot argue with the sellers who are taking the risk of making it available to us. But, at the same time when they are weighing it or dressing it behind close shutters we have no choice to verify the quality,” said a buyer,  
 
 Squads Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) officials on Friday conducted raids in parts of the city to check if meat shops were running without a licence.
