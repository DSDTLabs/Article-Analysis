JAIPUR: A day after a 32-year-old father was arrested for brutally canning his two kids, a local court in   on Wednesday sent the accused and his brother to judicial custody.

 “The father, Chain Singh Rawat who trashed kids and his brother Vanna Singh, who shot the video, were produced before a local court. The court sent them on judicial custody,” an official said.
 
 The Rajasamand police had arrested Rawat Tuesday after a chilling video of him mercilessly beating up his two children went viral on social media. “Vanna Singh claimed he recorded the video of his brother’s barbaric act he wanted to show it to his father. But he should have intervened instead of relish the cruel act,” said Bhavna Paliwal, a member of child welfare committee.
 
 The CWC members also spoke to the five-year-old boy and three-year-old girl, who were beaten up their father. “The children seemed happy, they are being kept in the custody of their grandfather,” Paliwal said, adding that Rawat’ wife was also quizzed.
 
 “She lied that she was not present, she did nothing to stop her husband,” Paliwal said, adding that case was not filed against the mother because she has to take care of two infants.
 
 The primary investigation suggests that the accused is an alcoholic and was reeking of liquor even when he was arrested on Tuesday.
 
 The chilling incident occurred on Sunday when the accused put a rope around his son's neck and tied it to the roof, while continued caning the boy who could be seen trembling in fear and pleading with his father.
 
 The Deogarh police station had booked Rawat under Section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), Section 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and other relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act.
