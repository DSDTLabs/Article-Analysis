Vadodara:   of Hanumanpura in Waghodiya and his mother were booked at Bapod police station on Thursday after his wife allegedly committed suicide at home on Wednesday evening.

 Aditi Parmar (24) was married to the accused Chirag Parmar in April 2013. She was being allegedly harassed by him and his mother Gita Parmar three months after the wedding for dowry. The woman’s father Shantilal told police that even after giving dowry, the mother-son duo harassed his daughter and beat her up demanding more money.
 
 The couple had a daughter in 2015 but the harassment continued, Shantilal alleged. Aditi had even returned to her father’s house after she could not take the torture any more. They even lodged a complaint with the police. However, after they reached a settlement, the complaint was withdrawn and Aditi went to stay back with her husband. However, the harassment continued.
 
 Shantilal told the cops that he had given a gold ring to Aditi’s brother-in-law at the time of her engagement. But recently, when her brother-in-law received a bigger gold ring from his in-laws, Aditi’s mother-in-law continued to harass her demanding a similar ring.
 
 Frustrated by the harassment, Aditi called her father, who lives in Atladara, on Wednesday evening and asked him to come and take her back. Shantilal told the police that in her last call Aditi told him that she wanted divorce from her husband. Her cousin rushed to her home but by the time he reached she had hanged herself to a ceiling fan. Her cousin brought her body down and informed the police.
 
 The police are yet to arrest the accused.
