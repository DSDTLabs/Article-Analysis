At work, everybody needs a friend to talk to, share work with once in a while and also ask for help in times of emergencies.
 
  But what you need to remember is that nobody likes to play an agony aunt or uncle to others at work. It usually ends up coming in between work relationships and creates unnecessary biases and imbalances.
  
  And again, beware of people who like play that part because it is a sure sign that they like to interfere in other’s business.
  
  And there’s no saying what they might do once they are privy to your relationship status, and family problems. Once your relationship with him/her sours, the other person might use all the info your pouring your heart out gave him/her against you. So, it pays to keep work relationships emotionally clutter free.
  
  Here’s how:
  - Do not   or complain about your boss to your   – even if one of them is your best friend. You never know when anyone might stab you in the back.
  
  - Avoid discussing your personal problems with your colleagues. You don’t need to indulge in a case of verbal diarrhoea just because some is offering to listen to you.
  
  - Even if you have been witness to some saucy details of a particular colleague’s personal life, do not share those details with someone else.
