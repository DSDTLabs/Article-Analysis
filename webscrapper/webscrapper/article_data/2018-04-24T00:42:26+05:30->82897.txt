Coimbatore: Childline officials have rescued a four-months-old girl from her 30-year-old father, who had allegedly attempted to give away the child to one of his neighbours at Kavundampalayam. The officials had received a call on Saturday night, alerting them about a deal to sell a baby going on near Kumaran Nagar. Immediate, a team of Childline officials along with Thudiyalur police rushed to the place. The caller had said that a fight was going on over the price of the child, district Childline co-ordinator S Uma Devi said. “But when we visited the spot, they were having a conversation. The child was with her father,” she told TOI.. “The man, who was a labourer, wanted to give away the baby as his wife had left the house, deserting both the child and her husband. He was unable to take care of the child. Two of his neighbours offered to adopt the girl, but a dispute arose when both the of them wanted the baby. That was when the parties preferred to buy the child for money,” Uma Devi said, adding that there were no evidence to prove that a deal to sell the baby took place. “After the father told us that he do not want the child, we rescued her and admitted her in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). The child was under treatment at CMCH for a couple of days. After doctors there confirmed that she was stable condition, she was discharged and produced before the Child Welfare Committee and was admitted to a home run by a non-governmental organisation ,” the official said. However, on Monday, the father approached the authorities to claim the custody of the child. “But permission was denied. Till the inquiry is complete, the child will be at the home under the official custody,” she added.
