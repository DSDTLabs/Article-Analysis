PUNE: The city may not face a   crisis over the summer months since the irrigation department has been able to save about 2 TMC water, thanks to theearly closure of water releasefor winter crops.

 About 3.5 TMC water flows from   every year during thefirst rotation for winter crops. This year’s rotation was stopped last week after the releaseof 1.5 TMCwater.
 
 The rotation lasted for almost21days between December and January first week. According tothedepartment, the release was stopped after demand for water from rural areas was fulfilled.
 
 
  
 
 “This year, the demand for water during the first rotation was much less due to extended rains till Octobe 2017, which led to decent stocks in local water sources. There was no point in releasing more water,” an irrigation department official said.
 
 Water is releasedfrom dams during thewinter season in two rotations. The next release will start either from January last week or a week later. Officials pointed out that both rotations are crucial notjustfor crops but also the department since it helps chalkoutthewater distribution plan until the arrival of monsoon.
 
 Sources in the department reiterated that saving about 2 TMC water during the first rotation was crucial. “This stock can be utilized during the summer months to meet drinking water requirements. The city would not have to face water cuts because of adequate stock in dams till June. If demand from rural areas remains low, the department can save another 1TMCwater during the forthcoming rotations,” a sourcesaid.
 
 However, an official from the irrigation department added that, despite fairly good stock, thecity willhave tocurtail water wastage. The city is already lifting more water than the stipulated quota. Judicious use of water would ensure enough stock in June and July, the official said.
