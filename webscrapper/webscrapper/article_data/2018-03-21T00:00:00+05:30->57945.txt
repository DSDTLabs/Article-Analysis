Janardhan Chikkanna’s film,  , deals with the subject of cybercrimes. While a lot of films boast about their use of CGI and VFX, and instead of letting it blend into the scene, make the graphics stand out, in Gultoo,   artiste and editor   has attempted to do things differently.

 Telling us more about it, Bharath says, “The CGI that I have used is mostly integrated graphics; there is no VFX shot as such. There are around 100 CGI shots in the film, and while some have been used for correction of shots, others are actual graphics that one can see on computer screens and in the background. While working on the graphics, I ensured that they don’t pop out. It is said about editing that you should edit in such a way that people can’t make out that a scene has been edited; I have applied the same logic to CGI. In   films, makers tend to add oomph to graphics so that the audience knows that graphics have been used. I have done the opposite — I have tried to keep the graphics as low-key as possible, so that no one realises that it has been used. It should seem as natural as possible.”
 
 Another thing that Bharath had to tackle was visually representing data that was required to be shown in the film. “Generally, films on hacking, such as Swordfish, have very unrealistic graphics. Janardhan did a lot of research on the subject in the form of data. Since I had no pictorial reference to go by, what was interesting for me was to convert that data into visuals,” he says.
 
 Having edited the film as well helped Bharath achieve the seamless infusion of graphics. While taking on the dual role helped in communicating between the graphics and editing departments, it was taxing as well, since he had to finish the edit, move on to graphics, and then get back to editing.
