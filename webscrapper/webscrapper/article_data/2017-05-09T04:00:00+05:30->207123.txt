VADODARA: The   Refinery (GR) premises witnessed dramatic scenes on Monday as contractual workers gathered outside the administrative office and demanded their rightful wages. The workers alleged that they were not getting minimum wages that were revised by the government earlier this year. GR management, however, said that there was no injustice to the workers who are being through bank. 

 “The workers are not getting revised pay as per minimum wages. In fact, many workers are getting unequal pay from the contractors. So nearly 2,000 workers didn’t turn up for work on Monday as they wanted their demands to be met,” said Lakhansinh Parmar, president of Yuva Sena Gujarat that supported the protesting workers. 
 
 “The contractors are not giving overtime and payment slips to the workers. We have submitted a memorandum to the management and asked it to solve the workers’ issues as early as possible. If not resolved within a month, we will meet the district collector,” Parmar added. When contacted, GR executive director, Sudhir Kumar said that the workers had some minor issues and they are being addressed. 
 
 “The government revised minimum wages some months ago but the contractors were hired for a predetermined fee. The contractors need some time to pay the additional amount to workers. We have already told the contractors to pay revised wages to all the workers or their fees will be slashed,” Kumar told TOI. He added that GR is particular about the wages paid to the workers and it has made it mandatory for all workers to have bank accounts to get gate passes required to enter refinery premises.
