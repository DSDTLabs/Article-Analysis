Panaji: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) on Wednesday discussed and gave an in-principle approval to the draft bylaws prepared by former south Goa collector ND Agrawal. 

 The by-laws pertain to solid waste management, recruitment rules, hawking and regulations for street vendors, and trade and occupation. The draft will now be studied by the newly appointed commissioner Ajit Roy.
 
 “The bylaws have been presented to the council. They are only a draft and these are not the final by-laws. The commissioner will study it for another eight days. We will call Agrawal and all the other department heads, and go through it,” mayor Surendra Furtado said. 
 
 The Panaji civic body has been operating without by-laws for the last 15-odd years and has relied on the archaic Goa municipal by-laws to regulate and function, in the capital. 
 
 “We have passed the draft of the by-laws in principle,” Furtado said.
