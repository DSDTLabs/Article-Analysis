 is a one-man army in the new 'The Fate of the Furious' trailer, which was launched at Sunday's Super Bowl. The new clip sees the bond of family being stretched to its breaking point as Vin's Dominic Toretto goes for the kill with bombs and guns blazing. 

 Although the new clip has a number of scenes from the first trailer, it does give fans a double dose of all the action waiting to unfold in the film. Going by this clip, there will be a lot of outrageous stunts, in the addition of a submarine to the fleet of supercars. The 'Fate of the Furious' is the eighth instalment in the 'Fast & Furious' franchise. 
 
 The first in the franchise without late co-star Paul Walker, the movie also marks the return of actors such as  , Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, and also newcomers like Scott Eastwood, Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren.
 
 Directed by F. Gary Gray, 'The Fate of the Furious' is set to release on April 14, 2017.
