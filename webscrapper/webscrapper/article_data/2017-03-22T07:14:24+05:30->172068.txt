 The leaders said that since the police had arrested the accused Arvind Chinva, who allegedly uploaded a morphed image of a Muslim holy site on his Facebook page, there was no reason to attack the policemen.
 
 "Muslim youths should change their confrontational attitude. Why can't we see police as our protectors and not enemies?

Policemen work under extreme pressure and they should have been given enough time to bring the culprit to books," said educationist Dr M A Patankar.
 
 Managing trustee of Mahim Dargarh Sohail Khandwani said that what happened at Cheeta Camp on Saturday night cannot be condoned. "Hurting religious sentiments is highly condemnable but Muslim youths should have allowed the law and order machinery to do its job.

 Shia scholar Maulana Zaheer Abbas Rizvi, while calling upon the police to act swiftly in cases which might cause conflagration, pulled up the community's youths to turn violent at little provocation. "Over two dozen have been arrested in the case. Some of the accused are minors. The administration must find out the main culprits and the innocents should not be harassed," said Maulana Rizvi. He also suggested a sustained counseling among the community's youths regarding respect for law and order.
