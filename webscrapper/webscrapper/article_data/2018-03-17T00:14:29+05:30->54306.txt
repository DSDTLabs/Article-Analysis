New Delhi: The   on Friday came to the rescue of   in the city and stayed the proposed plan of the government to close 38  .

 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar granted an interim order in favour of the petitioner, Sunil Kumar Almeida, who challenged the decision of   (DUSIB) to shut 38 temporary shelters operating from tents.
 
 HC asked DUSIB to maintain status quo till April 2, which is the next date of hearing, and also sought a status report explaining why it wants to close these shelters.
 
 Almeida, in his plea, informed the court that he was forced to move court after getting to know that “DUSIB, instead of ensuring safety in the night shelters, was trying to close them down in the name of having low occupancy when there was enough occupancy and the homeless are in need of these shelters.”
 
 The petitioner challenged DUSIB’s argument of no or low occupancy and cited “occupancy report of the shelters which are sought to be closed.” Placing figures from DUSIB’s website, the petitioner claimed that it showed “these shelters are very well being occupied in enough numbers and therefore, reinforces the requirement of them.”
 
 In the plea, Almeida urged the court that instead of temporary shelters, efforts should be made to construct permanent shelters immediately in the high concentration areas like Nizamuddin, Kashmere Gate, Bangala Sahib, Connaught Place, Azadpur, Chandani Chowk, Ramlila Maidan, among others.
