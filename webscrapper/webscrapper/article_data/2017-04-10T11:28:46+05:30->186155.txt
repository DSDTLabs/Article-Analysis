 contestants   and   enjoy huge popularity among fans ever since their 'Milley Jab Hum Tum' days. The two share a sizzling chemistry that translates well on screen. Considering they are quite a hit pair, there are a lot of expectations from the two on the newest season of Nach Baliye, where they are participating as a couple. 

 Somehow that didn't happen when the two performed for the second time on the dance reality show. Dancing to  's 'Piya Tu', Mohit and Sanaya started with great energy and enthusiasm, but then Mohit blanked out in the middle of his performance and forgot his steps. 
 
 
  
 Even though they continued to perform, Mohit couldn't stop cursing himself for forgetting the steps. Sanaya then talked about how Mohit is going to be upset about this the entire week. 
 
 The judges were, however, encouraging and kind enough to let it go as a one-off. Despite their performance, they managed to score a decent 22 out of 30. 
 
 Nach Baliye 8 airs every Saturday-Sunday at 8 pm on  .
