SURAT: The administration of the Union territory of   and   (DNH) has issued a circular stating that government advertisements will be cancelled to newspapers and periodicals which don’t publish government press notes. 

 The circular issued by the chief publicity officer, information and publicity department of DNH, on April 12, 2018, states most newspapers are not publishing government press notes and public notices. They had been asked to publish the same along with photographs whenever sent by the information and publicity department. 
 
 If any newspaper or periodical does not publish government press notes and notices, necessary action will be taken and government advertisements being issued to them will be stopped. The circular was sent to all media houses, periodicals and news agencies in DNH. 
 
 Recently, the central government had kicked up a row over its guideline on fake news which was later withdrawn following criticism. 
 
 A media person in DNH said, “This is fascism because newspapers and periodicals have been asked to publish each and every press note of the government, failing which the government will stop giving advertisements. We strongly oppose the circular by DNH authorities.”
