HYDERABAD: The Comptroller & Auditor General ( ) in its report pointed out `unfruitful expenditure on Quli Qutb Shah   (QQSDP)and slammed the government for failing to provide recreational space for the public. It also highlighted how authorities failed to resolve the issue of renaming the park.

 CAG said the government spent `2.70 crore, which includes two components -`2.15 crore for development of the park from 2006 to 2007 and another `55 lakh for `additional work' from 2008 to 2013. It also said in October 2016, the government admitted delay in renaming Deccan Park made the entire process of spending funds `unfruitful'.
 
 Refusing to accept the   government's justification that the issue could not be resolved on account of the statehood protest, the CAG minced no words as it obser ved: “The reply was not acceptable as more than two years had elapsed after the formation (June 2 .2014) of  .“ An excerpt from the report reads, “Not only has the expected returns on this investment not accrued, the objective of providing recreational space and facility to general public remains unrealised.“
 
 The CAG noted that work at the park was complete by 2006 and that the then government had estimated that `53.40 lakh could be generated as revenue by letting out facilities such as boating, swimming pool and computer huts, among others.Furthermore, the CAG reiterated that as much as `54.89 lakh was spent on protection and improving civic infrastructure of the park such as installing chain link fencing, laying tiles and desilting of the lake. Another `26.9 lakh was spent on maintaining the park from 2010 to 2016.
 
 While observing that the title of land was in dispute and that the High Court settled the matter in favour of the QQSUDA, the CAG took a serious note of the fact that civic body's   did not meet for prolonged periods. “ As per Rule 19(c) of Memorandum of Association, the Managing Committee (of QQSUDA) may meet once in three months or more often, if necessary . The Managing Committee meetings were not held after June 2011, as of August 2016 a decision of the Managing Committee was pending on renaming of the Park based on a representation of a Member of Legislative Assemble and the part could not be opened for public.“
