MUMBAI: The BEST has asked the   to pay Rs 8.3 lakh as reimbursement for operating extra   between December 4 and 6 last year when the city was warned of the possibility of being hit by Cyclone  . 

 Municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta has now directed civic officials to pay the amount to the cash-strapped transport undertaking.
 
 On December 5,   Ockhi moved close to Mumbai, which led to unseasonal rain and gusty winds. 
 
 BMC staffers were “on their toes” that day as lakhs were expected to visit Chaityabhoomi in Dadar to pay homage to the late Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar on the occasion of Mahaparinirvan Diwas (death anniversary) the next day, on December 6; more rain, gusty winds and high tide were expected. Many of the devotees are known to venture close to the sea.
 
 As a precautionary measure, the civic body decided to evacuate all devotees to nearby civic schools. The BMC is generally known to provide accommodation to the followers in Shivaji Park, which is in the vicinity. However, due to the rain and strong winds, this was not possible, and around 70 neighbourhood schools had to be opened up to shelter the followers. The BMC had to take special precautions and shut all entries to the Dadar shore due to 4.29 metre high tide. A senor BMC officer said BEST ferried several people stranded at Shivaji Park in the rain to nearby BMC schools. “There were buses stationed at LTT as well for the scores of passengers who arrived for the Mahaparinirvan Divas and they were unable to go to the temporary shelters due to heavy winds,” said the officer.
