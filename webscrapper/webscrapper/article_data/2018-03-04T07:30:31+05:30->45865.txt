HYDERABAD: Over a span of 50 days, Rachakonda’s   crime   have received a staggering 300 cyber crime complaints. Of this 50% are that of phishing, reveal official records.

 Admitting to phishing being a serious concern, cyber sleuths said that the failure of victims to file complaints immediately — or within 24 hours — makes it extremely difficult for the police to recover the money siphoned off through such frauds. Roughly, not more than 20% of this amount is recovered because of delayed filing of complaints, they added.
 
 “Over 150 cases are related to phishing. Though we have been running several campaigns to educate people about ways of avoiding avoid One Time Password (OTP) frauds, the numbers are still increasing,” said S Harinath, assistant commissioner of police (cyber crime), Rachakonda. He added: “As people often do not check their SMSs — where the banks alerts about account withdrawals are sent — because they are more consumed by other messaging services such as WhatsApp, they do not file complaints on time. As a result, recovery of money becomes a challenge.”
 
 In 2018, the Rachakonda commissionerate reported fraud of money worth ?20 lakh by victims due to delay in lodging  . “It is shocking to see how more and more educated people are falling into the trap these days. As most people transact online now, offenders are taking advantage of this to lure victims. About 8% of the victims are those lured by prize money,” said Harinath.
