CHANDIGARH: Giving no relief to Ashish  , co-accused in   Kundu  , the Chandigarh district court dismissed his bail application on Thursday.

 The court of additional district and sessions judge Rajnish Kumar Sharma said the allegations against   are serious and thus there are no grounds to grant him a regular bail.
 
 Earlier, the prosecution opposed Ashishâ€™s bail application, saying that he had an abetment to suicide case registered against him in   district of Haryana and thus he had concealed material facts from the court.
 
 In another argument, the prosecution said Kumar had twice been denied bail by the district courts instead of only once as mentioned in his bail plea. It was argued that just because co-accused   has been granted bail by the high court, it is no point that bail application of Ashish be considered on the basis of parity.
 
 The defence counsel pleaded that when Vikas   has already been released on bail, keeping Ashish Kumar in custody served no purpose. The bail application also stated that the cross-examination of Varnika was over and that she failed to mention kidnapping in her initial complaint thereby alleging the concocted nature of the FIR. Police failing to supply CCTV footage, media coverage of the case and presence of a lawyer during filing of the FIR were other factors mentioned in the application.
 
 Vikas Barala was granted bail by   and Haryana high court on January 11.
 
 On August 5, Vikas Barala, a student of law at  , and Ashish, a law graduate, had allegedly followed Varnika, daughter of a senior IAS officer in Haryana government, and tried to stop her car. They were arrested after Varnika had phoned the police. At the time of incident, they were believed to be under the influence of liquor.
