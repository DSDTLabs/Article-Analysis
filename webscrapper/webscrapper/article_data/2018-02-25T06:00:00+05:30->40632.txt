Prominent Hyderabadis from all walks of life congregated at a plush venue on Friday to pay tribute to   literary great  , who passed away recently in the city.   (IPS), former DG of Police, Dr Mustafa Kamal, theatre activist and grandson of late Kadir Zaman, Akram Feroze spoke about the late litterateur. Speaking about his grandfather, Akram said, “Every day we used to read newspapers together and what used to concern him the most was the violence happening around the world. His heart used to sink every time he read news of violence. I still remember when the bomb blast happened in Gokul, he asked me to print 1000 posters and distribute them across bus stands. He walked with 1000 people from   to Gokul Chat protesting against the incident.” Akram’s address was followed by a dramatised reading of the litterateur’s collection of short plays — The Man and the Parrot, on greed in modern-day society by Sharon Prabhakar, Rashmi Seth, SA Majeed, Noor Baig and Mohammad Ali Baig.
