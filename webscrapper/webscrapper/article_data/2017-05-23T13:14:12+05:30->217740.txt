NAGPUR: Ousted leader of opposition in   (NMC)   of Congress has issued notices to mayor Nanda Jichkar and   asking them to reinstate him. He has decided to challenge the decision of divisional commissioner   in Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Tuesday.

 Mahakalkar was replaced by his partyman Tanaji Wanwe on May 19 on the orders of Kumar. Wanwe enjoys support of 16 out of 29 Congress corporators against 13 backing Mahakalkar. The commissioner had appointed Wanwe as the leader of opposition on the basis of his support.
 
 The ousted leader of opposition told the media on Monday he was appointed by NMC house and the divisional commissioner had no powers to unseat him. “Congress is not an alliance of parties. It is a single party and hence a faction of the party, which is not recognized, cannot decide to replace me,” he said.
 
 Mahakalkar is a supporter of city Congress president Vikas Thakre and Thakre’s mentor former MP Vilas Muttemwar. Mahakalkar had chosen Thakre as a co-opted corporator from Congress quota, which was not acceptable to a majority of Congress corporators. They therefore decided to replace him. Wanwe has recommended the name of Kishor Jichkar for co-option into NMC house.
 
 Wanwe had met Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi with the help of former minister Anees Ahmed, former MP Gev Awari and former MLA Ashok Dhawad. Gandhi had referred the case to Ashok Chavan, president of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC). Chavan decided to support whichever faction had the majority.
