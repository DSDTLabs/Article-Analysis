MUMBAI: While the   by   and   drivers’ union at   received a “lacklustre response” on Tuesday, commuters in the suburbs faced a huge shortage of cabs during the morning peak hours. This was coupled with the   of Uber cabs, which were nearly double the regular fare.

 Sayed Juned of the Sangharsh Tourist Chalak Malak Sangh, which called for the protest meeting, said: “Several cab drivers didn’t come to   as they feared being blacklisted by the aggregator firm. But they showed support by staying off roads in the suburbs.”
 
 The union has threatened an indefinite strike from March 21 if their demands are not met. "We have requested the state government to allow a delegation from our Action Committee of Maharashtra — a group of tourist taxi drivers’ union — to meet the ministers and discuss the problems faced by aggregator cab drivers. We have also petitioned the aggregator firms and hope that the issue is resolved by March 20. Else, we will take a call for the indefinite stir,’’ he said.
 
 Apart from demanding more incentives, the aggregator cab drivers are also protesting against the newly introduced City Taxi Scheme, which they have termed ‘anti-driver’.
 
 Ola and Uber did not issue any statement on Tuesday. Sources in the firms said many drivers stayed off roads fearing attack by protesters.
