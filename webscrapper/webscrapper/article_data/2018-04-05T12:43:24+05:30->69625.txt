 Shorvari shares her concerns with Parth in private and tells him that they should let things be and not pressurize Teni into remembering anything from her forgotten past as it might endanger her life.
 
 Teni calls out to Parth and asks him to get a glass of juice. She is puzzled to see Parth smiling at her as she drinks juice. She thinks that Parth, being a driver, probably can't afford the good things in life. She allows him to drink one. She asks him not to tell Shorvari about the extra glass of juice.
 
 Teni then asks Parth about Shorvari's husband. He lies and tells her that her husband is in America. She then asks him if he has had an affair with her as she has read in the stories and seen in the movies. Shorvari, who is listening to all this from a distance, laughs at all that is passing between them. Teni promises to help Parth in winning over Shorvari. He is outraged at the suggestion.
 
 Then, Shorvari goes home to see Ipshita. At home, everyone was worried on learning about Teni's memory loss.
 
 In the hospital, Teni revels in the luxury and when she doesn't like the hospital food, Parth brings spaghetti for her. He gives her a bundle of money saying that the 'malkin' (Shorvari) had sent it for her daily expenses at the hospital.
 
 The next morning, the doctor discharges Teni. Chutkan, who thinks it's not appropriate to take Teni to the Bhanushali house, suggests to Parth that he should take her back to the Chawl.
 
  
 At home, Shorvari was happy to hear that Teni got discharged. When Parth tells her that Teni must go back to the chawl, she tells him to go there. She adds that she will join him there soon.
 
 Shorvari tells the family members that since Teni doesn't recognize anyone in the family, she has to go back to the chawl for now.
