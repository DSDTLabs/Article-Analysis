Udhagamandalam: Despite erratic rain and late monsoon showers, ‘September Season’, the second tourist season, has arrived in this holiday retreat. On Saturday, as many as 10,000 pots of flowering plants such as French marigold, ranunculus, petunia, pansy, gladioli and dahlia were displayed in the Government Botanical Garden (GBG). 

 The flower pot arranging ceremony was inaugurated by Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya. “Despite the continuous showers during the blooming period and very cold weather, we have lots of flowers this September,” said a GBG official.
 
 Every year, about 1,000 flower pots are displayed for the autumn show. The horticulture department displays varieties like French marigold and African marigold, which are very rare in the autumn season, along with asters, cosmos, dahlia-dwarf and calendula.
 
 “Different varieties of flowering plants in different colours have been arranged in the garden. With full bloom, the arrangement will be a delightful experience for tourists,” said an official.
 
 The blooms will last at least till the middle of November, the official said, “During this season, we get most of the visitors mainly from North India, especially honeymoon couples. More visitors are expected from across the country ahead of school holidays and puja festival.” 
 
 The sprawling green lawn of kikuyu grass, which welcomes the visitors, was introduced by the British 165 years ago while developing the Asia’s second largest botanical garden with an area of about 55 acres. The lawn is spread over 15-20 acres of land.
