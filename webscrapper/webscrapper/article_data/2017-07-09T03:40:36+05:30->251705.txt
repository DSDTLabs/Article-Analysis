NAVI MUMBAI: An ailing,   who was sitting inside the   ST bus stand for at least three days, was recently rescued by a few   who noticed his situation.

 “The 50-year-old homeless man could barely move as he had a physical problem. We showed him a vada-pav and he tried to move as he seemed very hungry,” said activist S Jayanamma of the Social and Evangelical Association for Love (SEAL) shelter home in New Panvel.
 
 Jayanamma added that only after the homeless man was admitted to the shelter home did he start to regain his senses and informed them that his name is Vishwas Ramdatta Thakur. He said that he used to live with his parents in Versova in Mumbai. But for the last few years he had been roaming around aimlessly. “While Thakur is lucky to have been rescued; there are many homeless people who simply die on the streets during the ongoing monsoon. That is why we insist that along with NGOs, the authorities must do a lot more to help the homeless,”' said the founder of SEAL, Pastor K M Philip. Last week, TOI had reported how an unstable homeless man. who hailed from Hooghly in West Bengal, was rescued from Nerul.
