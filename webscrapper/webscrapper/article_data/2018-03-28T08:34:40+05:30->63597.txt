LUCKNOW: On Sunday, 10 persons were arrested by the anti-terrorist squad (ATS) of UP police.
 
 The ATS sleuths found that four of the arrested youths were in constant touch with Pakistan-based terror groups,   ( ) and Lashkare-Taiba via   and video calling.
 
 The accused came on the radar of security agencies who were keeping surveillance on some handlers in Pakistan who had communicated with two persons with terror links in Jammu & Kashmir in 2016 and then in Madhya Pradesh in 2017.
 
 The same handlers were constantly in touch with four of the ten arrested. They were lured into the trap by being offered heavy commission on transferring money in different bank accounts and were issued directions via WhatsApp calls from Pakistan.
 
 UP ATS says it had de-radicalised 52 people in the past one year. Most of them had been radicalised via social media, it added.
 
 On February 5, Sheikh Ali Akbar of Ghazipur was arrested from Lohia Path in Lucknow. Akbar had come in contact with terror groups in Kashmir via WhatsApp and other social media.
 
 On February 11, three terror suspects were arrested from Gaya for owing allegiance to ISIS.
 
 IG, ATS,   said WhatsApp has become a tool for terrorists from across the world to radicalise and indoctrinate youths as its encryption-based messaging is difficult for intelligence agencies to decode.
 
 Last year, Abu Zaid of Azamgarh was arrested from Mumbai for radicalising youths for ISIS in India via social networks. He was also accused of extorting money through honey-traps and seeking secret information.
 
 “We are working on effective ways to counter the menace of radicalization via social media,” said Arun.
 
 ATS sleuths said the citizens must inform the nearest police station if they get calls from international numbers or phone numbers with less than 10 digits.
