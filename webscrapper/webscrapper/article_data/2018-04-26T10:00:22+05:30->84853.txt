TRICHY:   has nothing to do with   (AMMK) other than being the brother of the party's general secretary V K Sasikala, said   deputy general secretary, T T V Dhinakaran. "I am answerable only to the general secretary (Sasikala) and party cadres and not others," TTV told reporters in Kumbakonam on Wednesday. 

 He said people of Tamil Nadu well know that a party which encouraged family politics could not come back to power in the state, obviously referring to the DMK. So, he never encouraged that kind of politics, as there should not be any link between family and the party, said Dhinakaran.
 
 "Dhivaharan has not even visited the Bengaluru prison to meet Sasikala, because of his anger against her. The anger should be directed at Sasikala, but I am at a loss to understand why he is directing it at me," Dhinakaran said.
 
 Dhivaharan held an important post in 'Namathu Kazhagam', floated (against MGR) by then minister S D Somasundaram during 1984, he recalled.
 
 "It was former AIADMK leader J Jayalalitha who brought me into the party and the party general secretary (Sasikala) understands me very well. When Amma (Jayalalithaa) wanted to keep me out, I firmly accepted her decision. After her death, I came back to the party only as per the wishes of Sasikala, after she took over the responsibility of the party, as general secretary. Then she entrusted with me the responsibility of taking care of the party before she lodged in prison. Nothing was pre-planned. So, I cannot help it if someone felt unhappy over that," he said.
