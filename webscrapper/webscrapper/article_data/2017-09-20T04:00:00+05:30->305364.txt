Surat: Two modern systems to measure air pollution and monitor air quality would become functional at Varachha and Limbayat areas of the city by December-end. Ambient air quality monitoring systems are being installed by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) at a cost of Rs 2 crore under smart city project.

 Special commissioner for smart city project M Nagrajan said, “We are taking up this project on a war footing to improve city’s liveability index. Once these two systems become operational, SMC would install another 18 in different parts of the city.” 
 
 The work order for the systems has been issued, but clearance from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is still awaited. The data from these systems would be sent to smart city centre for processing. SMC would also share the data with Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB). Surat is country’s ninth most populated city and has high concentration of industrial clusters. The city has a population of 50 lakh and 26 lakh private vehicles. 
 
 “Emission of pollutant gases from vehicles plying on roads could become biggest detractor for the city’s future growth. We are looking at this seriously and want to keep these pollutants under check from now,” Nagrajan said.
