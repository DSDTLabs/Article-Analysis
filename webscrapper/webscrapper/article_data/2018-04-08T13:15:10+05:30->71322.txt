NAGPUR: The Mumbai outing of BJP workers, already-marred by delays and long-winding route journey, ended on a tragic note when   resident and Prabhag 9 president   died in the train during return journey.

 Behare boarded the special train arranged by the party at Bandra around 1am on Saturday. Soon after the train started moving, he complained of severe chest pain. Nagpur North MLA Dr  , who was in the train, examined him but found that he had suffered massive heart attack and had already breathed his last within minutes. Behare, 52, is survived by wife, two daughters and a son.
 
 The train was then stopped at Dahanu Road station around 2.30am and Behare was taken to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. Dr Mane, along with Behareâ€™s brother-in-law and another functionary Ramesh Wankhede, got down to complete the formalities. City unit general secretary   alerted chief minister   about the incident.
 
 The CM immediately rushed help from Dahanu and a post-mortem was conducted at the local government hospital and the body was released for taking to Nagpur by late morning. An air-ambulance was also arranged which was expected to take-off from Mumbai around 10pm and land with the body in Nagpur after 11pm, said Dr Mane.
