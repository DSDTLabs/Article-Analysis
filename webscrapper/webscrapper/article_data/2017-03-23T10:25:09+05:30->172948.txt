LUCKNOW: Lucknow police on Wednesday decided to constitute 23   to carry out 'Anti-Romeo drives' in the city. The teams would prevent incidents of harassment of girls in 235 spots identified under the 13 police stations. The spots includes girl's colleges, institutes, schools, malls, parks and all major places of public interest. 

 Each squad will have five members; one sub-inspector, two male constables and two female constables. They will visit the identified spots from 10 am to 8pm from Monday to Saturday and from 5pm to 8pm on Sunday. They have also been given vehicles with camera for recording incidents of harassment. The squads will report to the concerned circle officer. 
 
 SSP, Lucknow, Manzil Saini said the idea is to increase the presence of police in public as well as ensure safety and security of women. 
 
 At no point will someone be detained only to be asked to do sit-ups in public. However, the squad will monitor boys stalking girls and/or passing lewd comments at them. "The cops who are part of the squad will initiate action against those found guilty under sections 294 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 294 is for obscene act or words in public while 354 is outraging modesty," Saini said.
