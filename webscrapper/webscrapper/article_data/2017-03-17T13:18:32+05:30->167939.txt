Midhun Manuel Thomas' directorial   sets record by becoming the first movie to have a Middle East release prior to its Kerala release. The film that is all set to hit theatres in Kerala on March 17 will be released in Middle-East countries on March 16. 

 Earlier, Malayalis in Middle East used to share their eagerness in watching the 
  releases while Malayalis in Kerala express their opinion on social networking pages. And usually, the 
  are released after a week or a month in Gulf countries. 
 
 However,the Gulf Malayalis are happy now as they do not have to wait to watch Alamara! They call it as a wonderful move! 
 
 The Sunny Wayn-Aju Varghese film is social satire that speaks about some rituals held in Kerala during marraiges!
