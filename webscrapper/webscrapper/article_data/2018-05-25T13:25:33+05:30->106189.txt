"Mind your d**n business" is what   has to tell everyone...atleast his new song says so!

  The actor-rapper, who has returned as a crooner after 13 long years, addressed the divorce rumours with wife   in the song.
 
  
  
  In a recently posted preview video of the song  , Will is seen rapping, "20 years of swag y'all just witnessed, stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business."
 
  Further giving his family a shout-out, mentioning his wife and the kids-  ,   and Willow- he sang, " The real life Incredibles, last name Smith, Jaden, Jada,  , Trey-y'all ain't f--king with my clique."
 
  Will and Jada, who tied the knot on New Year's Eve in 1997, celebrated their 20-year anniversary last year.
 
  Even after being the subject of numerous split rumours over the years, the couple is going strong, and the latest song is surely a proof to the same.
