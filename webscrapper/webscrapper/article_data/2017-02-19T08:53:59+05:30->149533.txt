BOLPUR:   on Saturday organised a rally at the   site at Raipur-Supur village in Bolpur to silence the agitators who had been opposing the project since January. 

 The agitators claim that a university and a housing project coming up in the area won't generate jobs for which they had given the land way back in 2000. At Saturday's rally, urban development minister Firhad Hakim said : "The university will be set up here along with an IT park and the Gitanjali Township. Lakhs of locals will be engaged in these projects. CPM, Congress and BJP are trying to queer the development pitch. But our leader is   and no one can do anything."
 
  Hakim didn't stop at this. He derided BJP leader Locket Chatterjee who had led a rally at Bolpur the other day. " Oi je farsa mato meyeta...BJP r leader...ki jeno naam...galae jhole...je apnader ekhane third hoyechilo...o hyan Locket...se abar Bolpur e michhil korchhe (That fair lady, a BJP leader, who finished third in the electoral race here...what's her name...a neckpiece...Locket..she is now leading rallies at Bolpur)," the minister said. 
 
 Locket later said: "I met him at an event yesterday. It was he who took the effort to greet me. I wonder how he could forget my name. I take this as early signs of dementia. Such a disrespectful remark is quite unbecoming of a politician who comes from a party led by a woman."
