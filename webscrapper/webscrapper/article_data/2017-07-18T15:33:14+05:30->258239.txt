BHOPAL: Parking facilities in the state capital be it open parking, enclosed with boundary wall and multilevel parkings would be automatized. After weeks of delay,   ( ) has given the nod for modernisation of parking. It would be run by private operator on revenue sharing mode.

 ‘Smart parking’ spaces will be implemented at 58 locations across Bhopal, the first of which is to be ready by August 15, said BMC parking wing in-charge,  . Civic body expects major commercial areas to be under   surveillance with automatized boom barriers in another three months.
 
 Civic body’s earning would get a major boost from the new model. About Rs 11 lakh is the earning per year for the BMC from its 42 parking lots across the state capital. Corruption and pilferage is expected to be plugged after implementation of the new scheme that assures the corporation a revenue of Rs 25 lakh per month.
 
 The new proposal also sets the parameters for a unified city-wide parking solution. It would offer cashless transactions and limit the number of people employed on the ground. A centralised web-based application would also be developed for vehicle owners to find or book parking space on demand. Private operator would also coordinate with local police. Penalty would not necessarily mean impounding a vehicle. Surveillance would detect violators who would be sent e-challans.
