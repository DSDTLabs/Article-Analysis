BENGALURU: A 45-year-old woman has filed a complaint with   police (  division), accusing   corporator S   of attempting to disrobe her by pulling her sari. 

 Soon after the woman filed the complaint, Muniswamy too filed a counter-complaint against her, accusing her of attacking and abusing him.
 
 According to police, trouble began on Sunday evening when the woman, a daily wage worker, allegedly fought with Muniswamy and a few   engineers over road construction. A new road is being constructed near Kadugodi rail gate and BBMP engineers had directed occupants of some huts in the area to vacate the place. According to police, the huts stand on government land which has been encroached.
 
 In her statement to police, the woman said she objected to the road project and this irritated Muniswamy and others. “We shall not vacate our huts till people’s representatives visit us and hear out our grievances,” she said.
 
 However, Muniswamy brushed aside the allegations, saying the woman was trying to defame him.
 
 “We are constructing a 38ft road near Kadugodi rail gate. A few migrants had built their huts on the land where the road is to come up. We had earlier told them to vacate, but they didn’t. On Sunday, the ward engineers, AEE and the other BBMP officials went to the spot to remove the sheds. That’s when the woman and her son started attacking them. I was called to the site by the engineers, where I tried to explain to them that the road would benefit the public. However, they abused me as well. I did not pull her sari. She is like my mother,” he said.
