Talking to media persons on the day UP BJP election committee members held a meeting, UP in charge Om Mathur too clarified that final decision by the BJP   would be taken on the basis of recommendations by the state unit. It would be interesting to watch how many kin of prominent BJP leaders, outsiders and those with tainted record get the ticket.

The first and second phases of polling in UP would be mostly in the western region where BJP gained with the use of polarisation in the Lok Sabha elections. From the Bisahda episode to Bulandshahar highway gangrape, most communal issues find their genesis in this part of the region only . For the second phase of election to be held on February 15, nomination would begin on January 23.
