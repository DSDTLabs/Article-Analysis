DEHRADUN: Within hours of taking over as the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dehradun,   took to the streets in the wee hours of Wednesday to check responsiveness of the   in the city.

  Donning a track suit, Kukreti, a 2008 batch IPS officer, reached Clock Tower at 4.00am and called all the superintendents of police (SPs), circle officers (COs) and stations in-charge asking them to reach there within five-ten minutes. It was no surprise that many officials including some of the circle officers could not reach on time.
  
  Talking to TOI, SSP Nivedita Kukreti said, “The whole purpose of the exercise was to check the response time of the force to ensure prompt reaction in case of any happenings in the city late in the night or early morning.”
  
  While SP (rural)   and CO (city) Chandra   managed to reach Clock Tower within a few minutes, many of the other officials could not do so. “Some reached within a few minutes of my call while some reached a bit late, which is a matter of concern. I have asked everyone to respond to any distress call during night hours with priority and seriousness,” asserted the SSP.
  
  Incidentally, officers who reached after 15 minuted of the call, were asked to explain the delay and were warned that they should be swifter in their approach towards any such calls in the future. “I have asked them to be more alert from now on,” said Kukreti.
  
  Kukreti was earlier posted as assistant inspector general of police (AIG), provisioning and maintenance and nodal officer of city patrol unit (CPU) at the police headquarters before she was made the district police chief.
