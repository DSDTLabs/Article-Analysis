HYDERABAD: With the uranium rich village of Tummalapalle in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh all set to turn into another Jaduguda, officials of the   Limited (UCIL) on Monday conducted an ‘awareness’ meeting with select people of Tummalapalle and nearby villages.

 The session was, however, marred by detention of a team of environment and human rights activists proceeding to the uranium mining plant in Tummalapalle. The team led by senior chemical scientist and environment expert   was invited by locals for support.
 
 
 The police detained the expert team and kept them in police station till evening. But, following protests by villagers, the police allowed Babu Rao and others to interact with nuclear scientists and officials from UCIL and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC).
 
 Residents of Tummalapalle and surrounding villages have been protesting uranium contamination of water, soil and air. They also complain of health issues like skin allergies, ulcers and   . A few villagers have vacated their houses and settled down elsewhere in the district to avoid nuclear pollution.
 
 According to Babu Rao, UCIL authorities agreed to hold a meeting with the villagers on March 9. It was later put off to April 9. “We were detained by the police while we were proceeding to the UCIL plant for the meeting. We were kept at the police station and in the evening, I was allowed to participate,” Babu Rao told TOI, adding that the officials did not produce any documentary evidence in support of their contention that the region is free of uranium contaminants.
 
 Rao said as per   orders and international norms, the burden of proof lies with the polluter. “There is no proper lining for tailing pond. This is bound to cause pollution through seepage,” he said adding that the   finally agreed to submit documents in support of their claim.
