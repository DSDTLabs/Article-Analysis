Panaji: The Sanvordem   collapse on Thursday has moved the public works department (PWD) to go in for a safety   of all   and bridges in the state. Though two companies have bid for the audit, the   is waiting for the financial approval from the state government to award the contract, senior officials from the department told TOI.

 Pune-based ARAI and New York-based HAKS have made a bid, with HAKS putting forward the lowest bid. Once selected, the successful company will have to complete the audit within a year.
 
 The pending audit follows a central government directive to state governments to conduct road safety audits of state and national highways, including bridges.
 
 The audit is aimed at assessing the deficiencies that make Goa’s road network prone to accidents. It is expected to identify dangerous spots and recommend measures to curb road fatalities. 
 
 “Based on the audit report, we will prepare remedial measures that need to be taken to improve the condition of the roads and bridges,” a senior PWD official told TOI. 
 
 He said in the past, roads were often constructed without keeping safety as a priority, but that has changed now. 
 
 Plans following the audit include the latest planning, design and construction techniques, including sign boards, speed breakers, zebra crossings and reflectors among others. Also, encroachments that come in the way of full use of the road will be removed. 
 
 In May 2015, the Goa government notified the State Road Safety Policy, acting on recommendations by a Supreme Court-appointed three-member panel. The audit will be carried out based on these provisions. 
 
 The two-year-old policy proposed setting up of road safety councils and road safety review committes that meet every six months and three months, respectively. The policy has also mooted a road engineering cell, comprising officials of the PWD, transport department, and police, who would inspect accident-prone sites and recommend corrective measures.
