Dona Paula: Expressing concern over the functioning of the Narendra Modi-led government, which had imposed an “undeclared emergency” in the country, former finance minister Yashwant Sinha said a “slow poison was being injected into the body politic of the country”.

 Addressing a gathering of civic society members, former bureaucrats and businessmen in Goa, Sinha went warned that the current government at the Centre was destroying democratic institutions and undermining the Constitution.
 
 “The biggest worry is what will happen to democracy. There is an atmosphere of fear,” he said. “It is the responsibility of enlightened citizens to realise this and oppose it.”
 
 The outspoken former   leader was speaking as part of the National Forum, a movement he co-founded to initiate a dialogue over the ongoing political developments in the country. Former Union minister for shipping and BJP rebel Shatrughan Sinha, as well as Aam Aadmi Party’s Goa convener Elvis Gomes were present at the public meeting.
 
 Shatrughan Sinha, who remains a BJP MP, said he was not rebelling against his party but was merely providing feedback through a public forum since Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah refused to listen to feedback. “If telling the truth is a rebellion, then I am a rebel,” the actor-turned-politician said.
