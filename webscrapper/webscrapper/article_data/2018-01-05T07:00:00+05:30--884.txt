GURUGRAM: Residents of   have complained that a contractor of  , who was supposed to fix the area’s drainage system, has left manholes open — a safety hazard especially for children who often play in the streets. 

 They said two children had already fallen into the manholes and rescued, yet MCG hadn’t fixed the problem.
 
 “For the last four months, an MCG contractor was working here to clean up the drains. But after the work was finished, they left the pits open. Every day, we’re grappling with incidents of children and small animals like street dogs falling into them. Last week, a five-year-old girl fell into a pit, and could only be retrieved by her mother after great effort,” said Dinesh Vashishta, RWA president, Sector 5.
 
 Residents said there are such pits across the sector. “We’re glad MCG thought of de-silting the drains, but who will close the pits?” asked Sudhanshu Yadav, a resident.
 
  “I live near the   ground, where both the footpath and green belt have been dug up, with pits 3-4 ft deep all over. There have been cases of two-wheelers falling into these as well. MCG must do something at the earliest.”
 
 Vashishta said he had raised the issue with MCG a number of times. “They say they are yet to examine the pits. Apparently, with the contractor having finished his work, MCG is now supposed to inspect it before releasing payment, only after which will the contractor come to close the pits. But MCG hasn’t even carried out the inspection yet,” he said.
 
 An MCG official said they have already made an estimate of broken/missing lids for the manholes, and will send their examination team next Monday. 
 
 “Our team will inspect the area next Monday, after which the contractor will be paid. That’s when he will cover the open pits,” an MCG junior engineer told TOI.
