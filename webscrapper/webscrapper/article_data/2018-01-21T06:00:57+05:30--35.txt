GAYA/NEW DELHI: A   and the recovery of three   (IEDs) near the   in   on Friday evening, just days before  , has stunned the intelligence agencies.

 Two containers were found at the entrance of the main Buddhist temple, while the third one was lying near the Sri Lankan monastery situated adjacent to the Tibetan monastery where Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai Lama has put up since January 2. Shortly before the discovery of the objects, Dalai Lama had completed holding discourses at the ground.
 
 A large number of Buddhist monks and devotees from across the world are currently gathered in Bodh Gaya to attend Dalai Lama’s sermon sessions, which will continue till February 2.
 
 Intelligence agencies had strong inputs that some terror outfits like LeT, Jaish-eMohammad, al-Qaida and ISIS might have radicalised some Rohingyas living in India and were planning to use them to target Buddhist sites
 
 here to avenge their persecution in Myanmar. Teams from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and National Security Guard (NSG) reached Bodh Gaya on Saturday to assist Bihar Police’s probe into the incident.
 
 Sources said security personnel from NIA, NSG and state police are working on what is said to be “a solid lead” provided by the CCTV footage of the area where the blast took place. The officials refused to divulge more details. Gaya SSP Garima Malik said, “Revealing anything about the progress of the investigation will be counterproductive.” She denied any detention or arrest.
 
 A police officer, however, confided IM was the main suspect, but involvement of a Chinese outfit or Myanmarbased Rohingya too could not be ruled out. He added that the state police was in touch with the police in the two states.
 
 Security has been beefed up near the Buddhist shrine and the Tibetan monastery. Even before the recovery of the IEDs, the township was on high alert for the month-long Buddhist congregation involved 3,000 police personnel.
