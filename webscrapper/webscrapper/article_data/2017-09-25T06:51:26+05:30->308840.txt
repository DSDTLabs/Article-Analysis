AHMEDABAD: On Sunday, at a quickly convened meeting, the   government announced the procurement of groundnut at Rs 900 per 20 kg (or maund), to woo Saurashtra groundnut farmers in poll-bound Gujarat.

 Chief minister   said the new procurement price will be beneficial for farmers as the government expects a robust kharif groundnut crop. He also said that procurement will begin from  , the fifth day after Diwali. The prevailing market rate for groundnut is Rs 600 per 20 kg, Rupani said. The move is likely to put an additional burden of Rs 500 crore on the state exchequer.
 
 The announcement comes a day ahead of Congress vice-president  's three-day tour of Saurashtra, beginning on Monday. Rupani also claimed that this year, groundnut yield is expected to touch nearly 32 lakh tonnes. In the last financial year, the state had, in fact, procured almost two lakh tonnes of groundnut by which the government gave additional price benefit of Rs 175 to groundnut farmers.
 
 This year, during the second week of September, many groundnut farmers during the CM's   were demanding compensation for the loss of groundnut crop due to white grub infestation. "The news of a higher procurement price will help farmers tide over related problems," said a senior official of the civil supplies department.
 
 Rupani also said that in the coming weeks, the government will also procure pulses like urad, tur and cash crops like cotton at a higher rate, in case there is a bumper crop. Cotton production this year is estimated to be close to 73.6 lakh bales.
