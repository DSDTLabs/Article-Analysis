Vadodara: Suspended planning assistant engineer of Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA) and graft accused RC Shah was reinstated again after Madhavnagar quarters collapse because of his influence with top officials.

 This is what the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) told the principal district and sessions court here while opposing his bail application.
 
 The anti-graft agency told the court that because of his influence and his connivance with other corrupt officials of VUDA, his suspension was revoked and he was taken back by the body. Shah was suspended after Madhavnagar quarters built by VUDA had collapsed on Janmashtami in 2013. The affidavit filed by VUDA said that the circumstances under which Shah was reinstated was suspicious.
 
 However, when TOI had last week contacted VUDA chairman N V Patel regarding revoking Shah’s suspension, he had said that since Shah had no role in irregularities in that housing scheme, his suspension was revoked after an internal probe.
 
 Shah’s accomplice Chirag Patel, who has also applied for bail had surprisingly told the court that he had not accepted any money neither any cash was recovered by ACB. But, ACB clarified to the court that they had recovered bribe amount from Patel in presence of two independent panchs. ACB also told the court that the complainant had done video recording while giving cash to Patel.
 
 ACB also opposed their bails by raising suspicions that the duo might influence the witnesses or tamper with the evidences. The court has fixed further hearings in the applications for Monday. Both, Shah and Patel, who are currently in Vadodara central jail, had sought bail from court on July 26 on the grounds of innocence.
