INDORE: Facing a tough time in allotment of liquor shop licences due to apathy on the contractors' part, the excise department on Thursday opened online tenders for the third time. The tender was invited for remaining 33 liquor shops in the district on a discount of 5 per cent as against the price earlier reserved by the state government for 2017-18.

 The state government had added a 15% hike to last year’s licence price.
 
 At the earlier price, the department managed to allot 141 shops out of total 177 country-made and Indian-made country liquor (IMFL) shops by renewing the liquor licence while two shops were later allotted through lottery-system.
 
 For the remaining 33 liquor shops, divided into 12 groups, the department invited e-tenders but did not receive desired results. After this, the state government decided to cut 15 per cent hike to 10 per cent.
 
 The department sanctioned the bid received for the group of   and   country-made liquor shop in its second call of e-tendering.
 
 In its third attempt, the department invited e-tenders on 5 per cent discount and received 9 bids against the liquor shops divided into 4 groups.
 
 Senior excise official Dr Rajeev Prasad Dwivedi told TOI that five tenders for   group of liquor shops, two for Topkhana and one each for   and Gwalu (earlier known as Choral) group of liquor shops were received.
 
 “Of these, only one tender for Bhagirathpura group of Bhagirathpura country-made and Chimanbagh IMFL shop was received at above the bar of 10 per cent on the current year’s pricing. The contractor will be allotted the shops as he had given an offer with around 11.5 per cent rise” Dwivedi said.
 
 He added that as the remaining tenders are below the price reserved, it will be sent to the state government for further decision.
 
 “The state government will decide on any changes in the license price. After receiving the instructions, the local department may re-invite the e-tenders on March 23” Dwivedi added.
