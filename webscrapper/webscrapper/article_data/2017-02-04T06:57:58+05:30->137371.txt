THANE: The popularity of the candidates and his committment to public issues will determine the decision of voters while choosing their corporator during the upcoming civic polls.

 Reorganization of the old wards and the implementation of the four-panel system has made the battle to the   a tough test for contestants as the voter base in each of the 31 panels across the city has swelled to 50,000 as against the 10,000-odd voters in the past civic polls.
 
 Under the new system, four neighbouring wards have been combined to form one panel and the candidate will have to reach out to voters in the adjoining ward to ensure a comfortable victory margin. The recent split between the saffron parties and the possible division of votes has added to the woes of candidates.
