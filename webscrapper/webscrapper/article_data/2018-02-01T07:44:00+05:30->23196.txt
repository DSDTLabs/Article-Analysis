Amritsar: There is much disappointment among as many as 200 Pakistani Hindus aspiring to undertake pilgrimage in various parts of India after they were given visa to travel to Amritsar only in February. The Hindu jatha also includes families, who have preserved ashes of their deceased family members for immersing in the Ganga at Haridwar.

 President of Pakistan Hindu Sewa Welfare Trust Sanjesh Dhanja told TOI over phone from Karachi on Wednesday, “We are much confused whether to travel to India or not because we have been given visa for Amritsar only.”
 
 Dhanja said that out of 200 visas issued by the Indian high commission, 150 and 50 pilgrims were issued 5 and 15-day visa, respectively, but for Amritsar city only. “We had applied for visas to travel to Surat, Haridwar, Delhi, Amritsar and Mumbai, but everyone has been given visa to travel to Amritsar alone,” he said, adding that as many as 30 pilgrims had preserved ashes of their deceased family ones for performing their last rituals and immersing their ashes in Ganga river at Haridwar . “They are very disappointed. We have now sought help from the Indian government.” He added that they had also written to Indian external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj seeking her intervention for at least allowing them to visit Haridwar, besides extending their duration of stay in India.
 
 In a letter to Sushma on Wednesday, a copy of which was sent to TOI by the trust, the members have stated, “In Amritsar we can only go to Golden Temple that is for Sikh dharma yatra. Most of the people in this group are also coming with ashes of their relatives for immersion in the Ganaga and also to perform pujas.We would also want to go on pilgrimage to Mathura and Vrindavan.”
 
 Dhanja expressed hope that Sushma Swaraj wouls take note of the situation and help the Pakistani Hindu pilgrims.
