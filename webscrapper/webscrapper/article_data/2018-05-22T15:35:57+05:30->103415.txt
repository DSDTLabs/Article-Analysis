COIMBATORE:   leader   said he would initiate legal action against police officers who booked ‘false’ cases and arrested his partymen in Coimbatore.

 
 Slamming the   government, after visiting the Coimbatore central prison on Monday to meet his partymen lodged there, Dhinakaran alleged that the law of the jungle was prevailing in the state to silence political opponents. “I will approach the courts to take action against those policemen who foisted cases against AMMK cadres,’’ he said. 
 
 Dhinakaran said though his party cadre were the victims of the assault by   men, no action was taken against the ruling party members by the police.
 
 “Our party members were assaulted just because they held a meeting in Thondamuthur, the constituency of rural development minister S P Velumani. The meeting will again be held in   and I myself would preside it,’’ he said.
 
 Fifty-six members of AMMK were arrested by the police a few days back after a clash with AIADMK men and five were booked for attempt to murder.
