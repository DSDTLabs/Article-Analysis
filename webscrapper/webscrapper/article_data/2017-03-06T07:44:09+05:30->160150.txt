PATNA: Around 150 bikers from different parts of Bihar and Jharkhand took part in Rider’s Hunt, a first of its kind event sponsored by Royal Bihar Rider’s Club (RBRC), at   on Sunday. They were tested through various challenges to prove their mettle. The hunt was organized to initiate new members into the club.

 A customized Himalayan dirt track equipped with the hurdles and unpredictable challenges that a rider might have to face during a trip through the Himalayan terrain was prepared for ‘Figure it out’, which required the participants to draw an eight in the dirt without their feet touching the ground. ‘Carry your bike’ was a team challenge where the participants lifted and carried one bike to the finish line. Other challenges such as slow race and arm wrestling were also organized for the entertainment of the riders.
 
 RBRC founder president   said he wanted women to take up Enfield riding. “It is a sad reality that there is no Enfield woman rider in Bihar. I have a club in Pune with a large number of women riders. I plan to hold a similar event on the International Women’s Day and invite female bikers from all over Bihar,” he said. 
 
 Live DJ on the occasion kept the onlookers entertained. As bikes vroomed for different challenges, the excitement in the audience was palpable. 
 
 Major Shailendra Verma, who always wanted to be a part of a riding club but never had an opportunity prior to this, said, “I recently bought a Bullet Thunderbird. I am looking forward to being initiated into the club which would give me an opportunity to take long trips with a group of people. This event is turning out to be an excellent experience and opportunity for me.”
 
 Abhishek Sharma, an experienced rider having made many solo trips in the past ten years, said, “It is time I got initiated into a club. There is always something new to learn from other riders and to share your own experience. This event has brought all those people passionate about Enfield in one arena.”
