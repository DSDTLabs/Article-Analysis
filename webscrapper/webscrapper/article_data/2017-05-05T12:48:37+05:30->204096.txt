MARGAO: There was high drama at the   administrative complex, Margao, at 11am on Thursday as 14 people were stranded in a lift for over 45 minutes. 

 South   general secretary Roque Fernandes, 43, who was among the 14 individuals stuck in the lift told TOI that they had entered lift No. 3 of the South Goa collectorate as they were to meet   minister Vijai Sardesai in the minister’s chamber on the fourth floor. Of the 12 lifts in the Matanhy Saldanha administrative complex, only 10 are functional. A proposal for spare parts worth Rs 40,000 for the two non-operational lifts has been submitted to the government. 
 
 The 16-person capacity lift came to a standstill after climbing half a metre towards the first floor. 
 
 “We hit the emergency button but there was no response. We tried forcing the door open and screamed for help. We banged against the lift doors as we could not use our mobile phones. Then the lights went off and some of us began to feel suffocated,” Fernandes said. 
 
 Sandeep Tuenkar, who was also stuck in the lift, said, “After around 10 minutes of the lights going out, the lift descended to the basement where we opened the door using a motorcycle key. Fire brigade personnel arrived after we came out of the lift. The 108 ambulance service rushed a taxi operator, Alerio Fernandes of Varca, who was feeling sick to Hospicio hospital.”
 
 South Goa collector Swapnil Naik said he would ‘seek a technical report from Thyssenkrupp regarding the lift failure as there is an annual maintenance contract ( ) signed with the firm and a UPS back-up in case of an electrical failure wherein after three minutes of the power failure, the lift goes to the nearest floor’.
 
 Sardesai promised to initiate an audit into the maintenance of all its facilities. 
 
 “I will request the collector to take action if there has been any neglect and fix responsibility,” he said.
