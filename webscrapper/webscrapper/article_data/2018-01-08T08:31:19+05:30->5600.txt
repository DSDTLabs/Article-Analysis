HYDERABAD: Authorities at the   Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTU-H) warned colleges that they would not be considered for affiliation if they fail to upload   details of the existing faculty. Many colleges in the state are yet to upload the details.

 The varsity, via a circular, asked colleges to upload the details immediately. Earlier, it has also made it clear that the faculty against whose name Aadhaar details are not submitted will be blacklisted.
 
 “We have noticed many faculty members are submitting incorrect Aadhaar details. Uploading proper Aadhaar details is the responsibility of both the college management and the respective faculty and if any college fails to submit the details, we won’t count that respective faculty in the list and this would also result in not considering of the college for forthcoming affiliation,” said  , registrar, JNTU-H.
 
 The varsity said that submitting the Aadhaar details is mandatory and asked the colleges to submit the data as early as possible.
 
 “From the edited information, it is noticed that some colleges have not edited the Aadhaar particulars of existing faculty, department and specialization. As the above particulars are mandatory for both existing and newly added faculty, the principal or management of such colleges are directed to edit the faculty particulars in full in all aspects,” read the circular.
 
 Further, it directed the affiliated colleges to edit the faculty details in the JNTU-H affiliation portal to ensure that registration numbers of the current faculty are displayed and the details of those who have left the colleges are deleted from the portal.
 
 “The edit option is given for adding or deleting the details in their portal,” said the registrar.
