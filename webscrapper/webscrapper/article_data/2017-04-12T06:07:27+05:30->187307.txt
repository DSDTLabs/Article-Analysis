BENGALURU: Last week,   spotted a little Kite lying on the road side in JP Nagar of south Bengaluru. Under the  , the bird was about to faint due to thirst and starvation. He did his best to give it water and some food. But it was too late.

  If the number of distress calls the   of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike receives every day (about 250) is any indication, sweltering harsh weather seems to have taken a severe toll on animals and birds in the concrete jungle. 
 
 Dr Sriram, in-charge and deputy director, animal husbandry wing of BBMP, said: “Rescue calls include birds, dogs, cats and other animals faint or take ill due to heat. There are also cases of animals getting injured after meeting with accidents or fighting with each other, birds getting entangled to kite thread etc.” 
 
 Animal activist Suman R M said this summer is very harsh due to severe water shortage. “Many lakes and water bodies in the city are either polluted or have dried up. During a recent meeting of activists and environmentalists at Cubbon Park, we found out that even the prime lung space has ran out of water bowls. Even the irrigated water to nurseries and plantations here dries up faster, leaving no hope for birds and animals. Even the squirrels, which have made trees in several neighbourhoods their home, are facing the same problem,” he added.
 
 Though the scenario is grim, the BBMP has no proper infrastructure, rescue equipment or volunteers to help animals and birds and many of them ultimately succumb to ailments. “We are doing our best with the available volunteers and animal welfare NGOs. But for a vast city like Bengaluru, we need exclusive hospitals for animal care and specialists deployed there. We are in the process of establishing such hospitals in each zone of the BBMP. There is also a plan to procure dedicated ambulance for animals,” said Dr Sriram.
