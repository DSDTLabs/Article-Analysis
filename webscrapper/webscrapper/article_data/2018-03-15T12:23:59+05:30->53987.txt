 * The RK Nagar MLA's announcement to launch a political party comes weeks after actor-politician Kamal Haasan floated his party 'Makkal Needhi Maiam' in Madurai. On December 31, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth had announced his decision to enter politics but he is yet to launch a party.
 
 * Dhinakaran appealed to his supporters and the public to participate in the function in large numbers.
 
 * The by-poll was necessitated by the death of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa.
 
 * Dhinakaran, who won the   bypoll, held in December last as an independent candidate on the 'pressure cooker' symbol, had earlier told the court that he needed a temporary name and symbol for his group to interact with the electorate in the eventuality of elections to local bodies or any other polls.
 
 * Panneerselvam is the coordinator of the AIADMK and Palaniswami is the joint coordinator.
 
 * The court order came on an interim application filed by the Dhinakaran-V K Sasikala faction in their main petition challenging the Election Commission's November 23 order last year, which had allotted 'two leaves' symbol to the group headed by Chief Minister K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam.
 
 * The Delhi High Court, on March 9, allowed Dhinakaran's plea for allotment of a common symbol, preferably 'pressure cooker', and a name of his choice for the AIADMK faction led by him.
 
 * After a series of legal skirmishes over allotment of a party symbol, sidelined AIADMK leader   will announce the name of his political party and unveil the flag in Madurai.
