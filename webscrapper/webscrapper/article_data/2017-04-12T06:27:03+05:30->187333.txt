BHUBANESWAR: Senior Congress leader and former Union minister   on Tuesday urged Prime Minister   to constitute a tribunal to resolve the   with Chhattisgarh. 

 "Mahanadi is the lifeline of Odisha. The state would severely suffer if it would dry up due to the construction of barrages by Chhattisgarh in Mahanadi upper basin to facilitate water supply to industries," said Jena while addressing a news conference here. He said he has written a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to direct the Chhattisgarh government to stop constructions and to constitute a tribunal to resolve the issue.
 
 Jena also demanded to spend the cess collected on coal (clean energy fund) in Odisha. The Centre earns around Rs 8,000 crore from Odisha as coal cess and spend it on developed states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, he said. The   also criticized the Prime Minister for describing Odisha as poor in election rallies but diverting funds meant for Odisha's development for other purposes.
 
 "As the Prime Minister is focusing on Odisha and he is going to stay here during the national executive meeting, I believe, he will give a clear picture to the people here on these issues," he added. Jena also slammed both BJD and BJP for doing politics over kerosene. Both the parties are politicizing the issue which could have been amicably resolved at the official level. Senior BJD leader and cabinet minister Damodar Rout also disliked the way BJP and BJD are engaging in political tussle over kerosene issue. "If there has been any reduction in supply of kerosene, the state government could have taken up it with the ministry," Damodar said.
 
 Damodar also slammed the Union petroleum and natural gas minister   and accused him of behaving as the spokesperson of BJP and not like a Union minster.
