AHMEDABAD: The   on Friday ordered the police to carry out narco analysis, brain mapping and polygraph test on the family of a seven-year-old   after finding their allegation of assault against a school teacher dubious.

 
 The high court suggested that the tests be conducted on the three important witnesses — the grandmother, the father, and the mother of the child — after the accused teacher, Sunilkumar Damor, voluntarily underwent all three tests and apparently came clear.
 
 In September 2017, Damor, the head teacher with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s school at Shahpur, was accused of raping the 7-year-old. The girl’s grandmother lodged the FIR and her parents were witnesses. Damor pleaded innocence and his advocate Virat Popat submitted that he was falsely implicated because of a dispute over the issuance of the school leaving certificate and the re-admission of the child to the school.
