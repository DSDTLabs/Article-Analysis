RANCHI: Polythene bags have once again found their way into the city markets, within five months after the RMC had imposed a citywide ban. 

 Roadside vegetable and   can be seen handing over their products in plastic bags and similar is the situation with grocery shops. Also, the street food vendors can be seen handing over take away food in plastic carry bags. 
 
 A complete ban on use of polythene bags came into effect from November 15 and paper bags and jute bags were distributed among vendors by  . A month long drive was conducted after the ban was imposed to seize the plastic bags being used and an amount of Rs 43,000 was collected by RMC.
 
 However, the drive stopped just after a month and gradually the polythene bags started coming back in the market.
 
 One of the vegetable vendors who was giving out vegetables in polythene bags said, "The customers do not bring carry bags and ask us to give them packets. We cannot afford keeping jute bags as they are too costly and when we say we don't have carry bags the customers walk away without buying anything."
 
 He added, "In such a situation we have no option but to get the plastic bags as they are affordable."
 
 Meanwhile, city manager (enforcement) of RMC, Sandeep Kumar said that the drive to check on plastic bags is not being conducted recently as a result of which the plastic bags have made a comeback.
 
 "We have noticed the increase of polythene bags in the market. Our enforcement team was busy with   for the construction of Kantatoli and Harmu Flyover. That work is almost complete now and we will once again be starting a drive against polythene," he said.
