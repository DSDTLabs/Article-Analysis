PUNE: As many as 62,000 (52%) of the total 1.2 lakh seats in the state reserved under the   have remained vacant after four rounds of admissions. 

 Pune has emerged on the top of the list with almost 10,000 admissions being granted to students even though 36% seats still remain vacant while Thane registered 73% vacancies, the largest in the state, whereas Mumbai recorded 67% vacancies.
 
 For the first time, the admissions were conducted online across the state. Last year, about 45% admissions took place throughout the state. Officials are hopeful that more admissions would take place before the academic year starts in June.
 
 According to education officials, poor response in rural areas and parents insisting on admission to specific schools led to the poor response.
 
 As many as 8,278 schools participated in the   online process from the state with 1.20 lakh seats up for grabs. Till last year, the process was online only in districts like Pune, Mumbai and Thane but from this year onwards, the online process was implemented across the state, said director of primary education Sunil Chauhan.
