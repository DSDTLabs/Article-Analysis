AJMER: The inauguration of a passport service centre in Ajmer turned into an ugly war of words between BJP and Congress leaders on Sunday after Union minister of state for external affairs V K Singh, who was to inaugurate the office, cancelled his trip.

 The dispute began in the morning when V K Singh decided to skip the event in the last moment.  , the recently elected Congress leader from Ajmer Lok Sabha who was also invited for the programme, then staked his claim to inaugurate the office as it was a central project. 
 
 This soon turned into a ruckus as leaders of both parties accused each other of playing politics. Sharma alleged that BJP was trying to take credit for the new passport office, and threatened to take up the matter in the Parliament.
 
 State education minister  , who was also present, replied that Singh had asked him to inaugurate the office and claimed that he had worked for four years to set up the passport office in Ajmer.
 
 Sharma remained adamant and suggested the name of mayor   to inaugurate the office. But BJP leaders stood their ground and said that only Devnani would be allowed to do so.
 
 All leaders gathered on the stage and were seen arguing with each other along with party workers as officials tried to resolve the matter amicably. 
 
 Finally, Sharma left the place in a huff with his supporters. Later, Devnani along with women and child welfare minister Anita Bhadel inaugurated the office.
