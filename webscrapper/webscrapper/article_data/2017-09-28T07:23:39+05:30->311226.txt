Consider this. Since September 19, ‘#Bathukamma’ has got a whopping 1,16,94,371 impressions on Twitter alone. These numbers are just an extension of the   bonhomie that was witnessed across the state over the last nine days, which even saw a new world record being created with over 35,000 women gathering to play Bathukamma at   on Tuesday. The state festival has indeed become the symbol of   culture, not just in the country but across the globe, says  , director of   and Culture. “Interestingly, the Bathukamma festival was brought back into limelight during the agitation for statehood and used as an instrument to reinforce the Telangana identity. Today, the people have embraced it with much vigour and made it a part of their lives once again. The once-forgotten folk festival of flowers has 
become a symbol of our state,” he says.
