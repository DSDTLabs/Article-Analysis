BENGALURU: It was supposed to be a concert for a good cause. International DJ and music producer  , the man behind hits like Titanium, Dangerous, Lovers on the Sun among others is currently on an India tour. 

 Besides Mumbai, Hyderabad and Delhi, Guetta was supposed to perform a special charity concert in Bengaluru called #Guetta4Good and the numbers of the people expected to attend the concert were touted to be upwards of 10,000.
 
 This morning, however, a message on the   website informing fans about the concert being cancelled for the time being has left fans in the city miffed. An official statement that was eventually released to the media, quotes Karan Singh, the CEO of Sunburn as saying, “Due to the present law & order situation in Bengaluru following the events that transpired around New Year's Eve, the authorities have recommended against holding the David Guetta concert scheduled today in the city. We at Sunburn tried our very best to make it happen but the authorities understandably are not prepared to take any chances. Hence today's concert unfortunately stands cancelled. We hope to reschedule the concert subject to approval from the artist and the respective authorities. We will be back with more information as soon as possible. BookMyShow will be in touch with all ticket holders for the next steps. Other shows in Mumbai, New Delhi and Hyderabad are on as per schedule."
 
 The reason has stumped Bengalureans – concerts featuring international artists have been held previously without incident and there’s a reason it’s hailed as India’s concert city. 
 
 The city’s law and order authorities, however, cite the ongoing Agricultural Produce Market Committee Polls as one of the reasons for the concert being cancelled. When TOI contacted   under whose jurisdiction the concert venue- Embassy International Riding School falls, for quotes on the same, the spokesperson stated that a press conference was being held early evening to clarify all the issues.
