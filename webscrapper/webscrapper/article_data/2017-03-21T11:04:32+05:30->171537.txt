NEW DELHI:   came up with one of the most scintillating performances this domestic season to help Tamil Nadu overwhelm Bengal in the final of the   at the   on Monday. Karthik did everything that could be expected of the seniormost player in the team on a big day: A stellar knock of 112 against testing seam bowling which shepherded a young Tamil Nadu batting line-up to a modest yet challenging 217 and then helping the young bunch keep faith on way to the 37-run win.

 He, thus, ensured that Tamil Nadu maintained their dominance over Bengal in the tournament -they have beaten the latter thrice in the final.
 
 Bengal pacers   and   were breathing fire when Karthik took guard at 26-2 in the seventh over. Wickets tumbled from the other end at regular intervals as Shami and Dinda hit their straps. Yet, Karthik looked in a different league, comfortable and pleasing to the eyes. Something which Bengal skipper   would look back at in envy. Guiding a young batting line-up made the difference between the teams.
 
 Judging a seasoned batsmen, who has had a fair run with the Indian team, against a domestic attack is debatable. But the Bengal line-up had three bowlers who have represented the country and who were hitting their spots on the day. Dinda (3-36), Shami (4-26) and   were putting the batsmen through a stern examination, just what the national selectors present at the ground would have wanted. There was pace and movement off the pitch for the quickies while Ojha's guile never allowed Karthik to build a partnership.
 
 
 
 
 Manoj Tiwary lashed out at his openers   and Abhimanyu Easwaran for an unusually slow start to the chase. "It's unacceptable. Six runs in six overs, I can't understand what was going through their minds. It shows that they are still very young," a dejected Tiwary said after the match. While the 21-year-old Easwaran has played only 11List A games, Goswami was playing his 61st.
