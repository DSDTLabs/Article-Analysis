BENGALURU: Former minister and rebel MLA N  , who has been suspended for anti-party activities, made a futile bid to speak to JD(S) supremo H D   in Srirangapatna, about 128 km from Bengaluru, on Wednesday. 

 Gowda allegedly refused to entertain the heavyweight politician from Mandya who went to meet him with wife Dhanalaksmi. The JD(S) supremo stopped at Srirangapatna briefly before leaving for Mysuru to attend the the marriage of former vice-chancellor K S Rangappa's son.
 
 A JD(S) leader, who was witness to the incident, said Cheluvarayaswamy tried his best to speak to Gowda but without success. While Dhanalakshmi bent down to touch Gowda's feet and seek his blessings, Cheluvarayaswamy tried to converse with him. But Gowda reportedly left the place in a huff, party sources said.
 
 Gowda, however, clarified in Mysuru that he did not snub the couple but blessed them before leaving the place. In a statement, he said: "I am 84 years old. I do not behave in an uncivilized way or ill-treat anybody. Politics is different; behaviour is different." 
 
 Earlier, Cheluvararaswamy had made a vain attempt to meet JD(S) state president H D Kumaraswamy, purportedly to convey the message that he was keen on returning to the party fold.
 
 The JD(S) had suspended eight legislators, including Cheluvaraswamy, for cross-voting in favour of ruling Congress candidates in last year's   and  . The eight had been preparing the ground to join the Congress but with their chances of getting tickets dimming before the 2018 assembly polls, they are trying to make a comeback, sources said.
 
 K Gopalaiah from   constituency was the only one to have been pardoned by the JD(S) bosses after he apologized. However, the same treatment was not given to Cheluvarayaswamy and Srirangapatna MLA Ramesh Bandisiddegowda even after they apologized, said a senior JD(S) leader.
