NEW DELHI: After BJP's failure to form government in Karnataka even after emerging as the single largest party, the top leadership is all set to swing into action for the 2019 mega challenge with party chief   intensifying bid to do well in three coastal states of West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh besides Telangana which account for 105 Lok Sabha seats. 

 The party though is simultaneously gearing for the next round of polls in four states - Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram - slated for November-December this year.
 
  BJP has identified seats, many of which fall in these states, where the party had not done well in the 2014 elections and wants to consolidate in those regions to compensate for possible losses in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where it had done very well. 
 
 West Bengal (42 Lok Sabha seats), Odisha (21), Andhra Pradesh (25) and Telangana (17) are the four states on the top of BJP's agenda where Shah is expected to visit frequently in the next few weeks to galvanise the party cadres. 
 
 "With the election process in Karnataka coming to a close, Telangana would be one of the focus states for BJP and the party is gearing up for the polls in 2019," said BJP's Telangana president K Laxman. 
 
  He said during a recent meeting in Delhi, Shah had emphasised on these four states. "Shah is likely to visit Telangana next month to assess the political situation and plan for the elections," he said . Although the party finished a distant second to the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal during recent violence-marred panchayat polls, the BJP leadership sees good prospects for the party in the state. "I am confident of winning 22 seats in West Bengal," Shah said recently . 
 
 Shah will be equally busy in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha where the party expects to improve its tally .
