BHOPAL: A consultative meeting of stakeholders:   (BMC) and   (MPPCB) and a petitioner with   (NGT) members over ‘extensive use of pesticides and fertilisers’ in Upper Lake case was discussed on Thursday. NGT members Justice Dalip Singh and member S S Garbyal recommended BMC commissioner   to conduct studies or prepare report on treated and untreated water being released in Upper Lake and what can be done to maintain its level so that the most important drinking water resource doesn’t get depleted in future.

 The commissioner and MPPCB members were recommended to get a report prepared on release of sewage water from household into the Upper Lake. Besides, use of fertilisers and pesticides being used by people doing farming in the catchment area were also highlighted.
 
 On January 11, the NGT had asked the petitioner to file petitions in 7 different parts so that the case can get the direction and resolved quickly. Previously, the case was heard for three years, but was heading nowhere as there were many aspects to it. The petitions have been filed on issues of encroachment, demarcation of FTL, illegal marriage garden in catchment area, Biomedical waste, sewage being disposed of in the Upper Lake, farming in catchment area, use of pesticides, wetland plan implementation, marking and full tank level.
 
 A case of full tank level has been scheduled for February 14.
 
 During its hearings in 2016, the NGT was determined to make Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) work and come up with a proper report on conservation of Upper Lake. Hearing the petition on July 28, 2016, it asked the BMC to count all pillars in Upper Lake, which submerged in heavy rain even before the lake reached full tank level (FTL). The civic body followed the order. The retaining wall also remained a controversial issue throughout the year until the CM intervened.
