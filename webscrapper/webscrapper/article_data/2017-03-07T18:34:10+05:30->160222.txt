PANAJI: Mangoes will no longer be the focus this year at the annual Konkan   in  .

 Bananas and plantains will be the centre of attraction at the much-awaited three-day festival to be held from April 21 at the Campal Promenade in Panaji. Hosted by the Botanical Society of Goa, the festival will feature fruit-based competitions and display a range of local, as well as exotic fruits. “Paving the way for other popular and lesser-known fruits of the Konkan belt, mangoes will take a backseat this time,” said Miguel Braganca of the Botanical Society of Goa.
 
 Varanasi-based National Institute of Abiotic Stress Management will conduct a session on dragon fruit at the festival. Belonging to the cactus family, this egg-shaped, magenta-coloured fruit with tipped yellowish-green scales is daunting in appearance. However, once slit open, it reveals tender white flesh sprinkled with edible black seeds.
 
 The festival will bring together fruit growers, fruit product processors, besides students of Don Bosco College of Agriculture, Sulcorna, and Ramanata Crisna Pai Raikar Institute of Agriculture, Ponda. The event will have an industrial focus with the participation of the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Besides the state forest department and the Western Ghats Kokum Foundation, Goa-based Indian Council of Agricultural Research - Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute will take part in the event.
