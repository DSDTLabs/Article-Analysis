NOIDA: At least 18 certificates issued by hospitals to police have mentioned “food poisoning” as the reason behind students falling ill after having meals at   school in Noida.

 Apollo Hospitals in Delhi, Max hospital in Noida’s Sector 19 and   in Sector 128 have sent 43 medico-legal certificates to the police in total. The certificates are legal documents pertaining to patients that hospitals share with police to help them in the probe.
 
 The revelation comes a day after Step by Step sent emails to parents claiming they had sent for testing samples of   and water that had been served to the students last week. The food department, however, had denied receiving any such sample.
 
 All the 18 certificates that mentioned “food poisoning” were issued by Jaypee Hospital.
 
 Over 100 students of Step by Step had complained of stomach ache and vomited after having food at the school last week. The lunch had been served by Sodexo, whose licence has reportedly been suspended. Sodexo, however, said they were yet to receive any such intimation. 
 
 Sources said a police team was likely to visit the school when it would reopen on Monday. 
 
 The cops are likely to note down the names of people who manned the kitchen at the school. A visit by a food department team on Friday had yielded little other than ajwain and edible oil in the kitchen.
