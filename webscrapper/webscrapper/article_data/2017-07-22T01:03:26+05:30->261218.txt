The   on Friday recused itself from hearing a plea by absconding   Zakir Naik’s NGO,   (IRF), to set aside the special judicial tribunal’s decision to ban the organisation under the  . 

 When the plea came up for hearing, acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal recused (excuse oneself from a case because of a potential conflict of interest or lack of impartiality) herself and directed that the case be listed before another HC bench. Mittal questioned if the HC has the jurisdiction to hear the case or whether the appeal should have gone directly to the Supreme Court. The hearing will now continue before a different bench on July 27.
 
 The IRF contended that the “tribunal erred in observing that there is material indicating communal riot because of the speech made by Naik”.
 
 On May 11, the special judicial tribunal had found sufficient reasons, including IRF, posing a threat to India’s security, to declare it an unlawful association.
 
 IRF claimed the tribunal “failed to appreciate that it was undisputed position that Naik is the president of the IRF, but the same could not reflect upon the action carried out by him in his individual capacity”. It said actions attributed to individuals named in FIRs cannot reflect on the organisation and will affect the charitable and educational work being done by it.
 
 The tribunal found that Naik has failed to take part in the legal proceedings before it and was “absconding and untraceable”.
 
 Upholding the Centre’s 2016 notification banning IRF for five years, the tribunal had said there are sufficient reasons to declare IRF an unlawful association. 
 
 “Even though IRF is not accused but there is material which shows that Naik was the founder of IRF and empowered to assign any work on behalf of IRF to others associated with IRF,” it had concluded.
