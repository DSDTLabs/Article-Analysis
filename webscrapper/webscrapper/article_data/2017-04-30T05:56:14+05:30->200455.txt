VADODARA: M S University has decided to issue legal notice to its chief accounts officer (CAO) Umesh   for his alleged indiscipline and rude behaviour with the top brass of the varsity. 

 The university’s syndicate members during their meeting on Saturday decided that they will approach the state government to make representation against Oza, who allegedly does not even sign the muster. 
 
 Gujarat government has sent Oza, a government employee, on deputation at the university head office where the post of CAO was vacant since quite some time. 
 
 TOI had earlier reported about the war of words that had sparked off between Oza and MSU’s officer on special duty (registrar)   after the latter issued a circular directing Oza to route all the communications regarding policies, procedures and rules and regulations through her office. Oza had hit back questioning her authority.
 
 “It wasn’t for the first time that Oza rudely behaved with the officer. He does not sign documents and does not even inform registrar or the vice-chancellor whenever he is on leave,” said a syndicate member, adding that since he is a state government employee, the university body will ask the state government to take action against him. 
 
 The university’s syndicate members have also decided to take legal opinion in connection to the case of Akeel Ahmed, the professor of sculpture department, who has been held guilty by an inquiry committee of selling sculptures of master artists to city-based gallery owner without their knowledge.
