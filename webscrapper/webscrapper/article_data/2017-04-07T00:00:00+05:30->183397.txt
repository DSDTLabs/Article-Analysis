Some of the things that often come to people’s minds when you mention the word rugby is heavy contact, roughness and a lot of injuries. To dispel such a notion, and to get more people in the city to embrace the sport, the   (KRFU) will host a mixed gender   tournament in the city on Saturday. The six-a-side tournament, which will be played at an artificial turf ground in  , will be the ‘touch’ variant of rugby — meaning the players will not tackle each other and instead merely   the opponent with both hands for it to be considered as a tackle. National rugby team player  , one of the board members of   and captain of Bangalore Rugby   Club (BRFC), says, “We are organizing this tournament to get more men and women from the city to take up the sport. It will be a fun tournament, in which teams can turn up in themed costumes.” 

  
  
 Roshan adds, “There will be no heavy contact involved. Teams will be required to have at least one girl player on each point, but can have as many as they like.”
 The tournament will host 12 teams — seven from various clubs in the city, two corporate teams and the remaining three each comprised of football players, foreigners and Dream A Dream, an NGO, respectively. The rules for touch rugby will differ a little from regular rugby — the offence gets five touches/attempts to score a point on each drive, the defense cannot tackle, but needs to touch the ball-holding offensive player with both hands for it be considered as a tackle, no kicking, etc.
 In the past, KRFU has hosted mixed touch tournaments, including a national touch rugby tournament, which saw participation from cities such as Pune, Mumbai and Chennai. “It’s true that we’ve earlier conducted mixed touch tournaments, including a national touch rugby tournament in the city, but they have been very sporadic. From this tournament onwards, we want to hold monthly rugby-related activities to lure men and women into taking up the sport,” says Roshan.
