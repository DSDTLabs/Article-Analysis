Patiala: Slamming Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for demanding royalty for   of Punjab, Patiala MP Dharamvira Gandhi described it as illogical and against the provisions of law. 

 Reacting to Thakur’s demand, suspended AAP leader Gandhi asked the Punjab government, especially chief minister Amarinder Singh, to take this opportunity and make use of the forthcoming talks to reopen the case for riparian rights over river waters and have it decided as per the constitutional provisions in the interest of the state and its people. 
 
 Gandhi, who has floated political front Punjab Manch, said Punjab and Himachal Pradesh were co-riparian states in case of the Beas and Satluj but contended that clause 7 of the Interstate River Waters Dispute Act-1956 forbids a co-riparian state from demanding the cost of water. He further said that Himachal Pradesh being an upper riparian state could lay claim to its share of waters for its usage and use that water. Gandhi said the upper riparian state couldn’t stop the flow of that water nor divert it, or sell it to another state.
 
 He said that loot and injustice had been done to Punjab and it was still continuing. “For seven decades, Punjab has been divested of its rights over its river waters and supplied free water to non-riparian states like Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi. The Punjab Manch has now filed a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court to restore Punjab’s right over its waters and demanded cost for the water taken from Punjab under duress.”
