A meeting between   and other medical representatives was organized in the city on Thursday wherein measures to provide protection to the doctors were discussed.

 It so happened the relatives of a patient thrashed a 31-year-old resident doctor at the Civil Hospital in Dhule, late on Sunday. The doctor suffered severe injuries and had to be admitted to the hospital.
 
 “This is sheer injustice to the doctors. After all they are trying to save a patient’s life and therefore should never be abused or beaten,” said Dr Shakil Vadaliwala, resident MD paediatrician, VS Hospital.
 
 According to information provided by   (IMAGSB), assault on doctors and even on paramedical staff members is very common. This is especially true for general hospitals and civil hospitals across Ahmedabad.
 
 “We have condemned the incident that occurred in Dhule and we completely support Maharashtra State Branch of IMA in their movement. We believe that security must be deployed outside all the emergency and casualty wards at hospitals so as to avoid such incidents,” said Dr Yogendra Modi, president, IMAGSB.
 
 “Restrictions should also be imposed on the number of relatives being allowed at the hospital to stay along with the patients. In certain cases, hoards of relatives turn up at the hospital and create unnecessary disturbance, making it difficult for the doctors as well as the paramedical staff to function,” he added.
