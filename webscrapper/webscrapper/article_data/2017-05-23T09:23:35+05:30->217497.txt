 The centre which will have CCTV cameras installed to capture activities of the bird and a studbook to study behavior of each bird will be maintained.

Generally injured and rescued birds are brought to the facility and are released back in the forest after they recover.The department will also try breeding on jujurana (western tragopan), the endangered bird species which is the state bird of Himachal.
 
 Monal was formerly the state bird of Himachal and its illegal poaching for the crest and meat are blamed for the dwindling numbers.Despite the fact that the government imposed a ban on its hunting in 1982, it is still being hunted.
