MANGALURU: I am blamed for the mistakes of others, and I apologize if anyone is hurt by a parody of a devotional song of  , made to suit my political campaign, said Mangaluru City North MLA B A  .

 Bava, who has embarked on a week-long padyatra, called an urgent press meet here on Saturday, in the backdrop of a controversy over distortion of a devotional song. He said that it may have been done by his followers/haters, and that the mistake was not intentional. 
 
 “Whoever has made this campaign song, has used only the tune, and nowhere have religious sentiments been hurt, which can be verified. I am a staunch follower of Ayyappa Swamy. During Makara Sankranti, when Ayyappa devotees organize pujas in my constituency, I attend scores of such programmes and often donate in my personal capacity. Some people who cannot see my political success have misused the song to tarnish my image,” said an emotional Bava.
 
 The MLA urged people to stop spreading the song on social media. “Just because I am from a minority community, doesn’t mean that I hurt the sentiments of followers of other religions. If I have done wrong, God will punish me.”
 
 He also mentioned that necessary action will be taken against those who were responsible for using the song in this manner.
 
 On Friday, the   submitted a complaint to deputy commissioner Sasikanth Senthil, seeking action against those who distorted an Ayyappa devotional song to suit their political campaign.
