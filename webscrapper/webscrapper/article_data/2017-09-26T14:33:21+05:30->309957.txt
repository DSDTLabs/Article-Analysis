NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday marginally lowered its growth forecast for India on account   and sluggish consumption and low investment in the economy.

 In its latest outlook the Manila-based multilateral agency said, economic growth will moderate to 7 per cent in 2017, from 7.4 per cent estimated earlier, before picking up to 7.4 per cent next year. It said the “transitory challenges temper India’s strong growth prospects”. The revision is based on the slowdown in the first quarter of the current financial year, when the Indian economy expanded 5.7 per cent, the slowest pace of growth in three years.
 
 “The downgraded forecast for India reflects an unexpectedly weak first quarter in 2017-18, in which growth was unsettled in the run-up to the July implementation of a goods and services tax while the economy was still recovering from a surprise demonetisation last November,” the report said.
 
 While   blamed demonetisation for some of the woes it expects the move to result in gains in the future. “Demonetisation last November suppressed small businesses and private credit, and adjustment to the new national goods and services tax muted manufacturing. However, short-term disruption is expected to dissipate, allowing these initiatives to generate growth dividends over the medium term,” the report said.
 
 The agency also lowered its inflation projection for the year to 4 per cent, from 5.2 per cent earlier, and expected a mild pick up in the pace of price rise in 2018 with inflation estimated at 4.6 per cent.
