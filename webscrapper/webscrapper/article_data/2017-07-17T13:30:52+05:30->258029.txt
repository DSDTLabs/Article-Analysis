AHMEDABAD: Not many know this but exactly 150 years ago, Paris hosted a photographic exhibition of Ahmedabad’s ancient medieval structures at ‘Exposition Universelle’ held in Paris between April 1 to November 3 in 1867. Now, in 2017, Unesco’s   in Paris, has bestowed on Ahmedabad’s Walled City the global recognition of a  . 

 In the grand 1867 Paris exhibition, artists and collectors from 42 countries had participated. Photographs of Ahmedabad displayed at the exhibition showed a unique amalgamation of Hindu and Islamic architecture in Ahmedabad’s buildings. It was the first time that Indo-Islamic architecture from the western part of India had received wide acclaim from scholars across Europe.
 
 Now, with recognition as a World Heritage City, Ahmedabad has come full circle. In those days, not much documentation was done for submissions but, in 1887, an enthusiastic British collector AW Crawley, the in-charge of Ahmedabad, began preparing a detailed document for conservation of the ancient structures in the city, including Hindu and Jain institutions. 
 
 The report Crawley prepared was called ‘A scheme for the protection and conservation of ancient buildings in and around the city of Ahmedabad’. 
 
 “Recently, Unesco at its 41st session in Poland, has taken a commitment from Ahmedabad for preparing detailed heritage management plan. Crawley did the work 131 years ago,” historian   said.
