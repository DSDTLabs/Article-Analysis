HYDERABAD: This Independence Day,   is all set to chug. But hold your breath, it will not be in Hyderabad, but in Nagpur. Having acquired 57 engines and 171 coaches long ago,   has been unable to utilise them as the project is still incomplete. 

 Following a request from Nagpur that two engines and six coaches be leased to them for   for the metro rail project in that city, HMRL obliged and the trial runs are to commence on August 15 this year.
 
 The engines and coaches are to be leased to Nagpur for a period of three years. Official sources said the coaches were dispatched to Nagpur a couple of weeks ago from Uppal depot on special   trailers and that the same arrived in Nagpur on July 28.
 
 The trial run in Nagpur will be for a stretch of 5.6 km of the total 38.2 km. The state government has reportedly taken the decision to lease the metro rail engine and coaches to other cities as the same are lying unutilised for the past three years.   L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited had procured the 57 engines and 171 coaches at a cost of 1,800 crore from   in   for all the three corridors covering a distance of 72 km.
