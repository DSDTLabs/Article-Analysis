Television presenter  , whose travel tales of Europe with her 7-year-old daughter, will be showcased in a 10-part series "Mini Me" on the small screen, says both her children are not adversely affected by the exposure they receive due to their celebrity parents.
 
 Mini, who is married to popular filmmaker  , has two children,daughter Sairah and son Vivaan, 13.
 
 The growing paparazzi culture has put the spotlight on celebrity children in showbiz like never before.
 
 Most celebrities try to shield their children from the limelight, so what made Mini choose to do a show with her young one?
 
 "When my kids were small, every celeb would keep their kids away from the glare of the cameras and would shield their photographs. But this is 2018, and   has a big following, and all children have their Instagram accounts.
 
 "We would be running behind if we felt that by not putting their faces on camera, we would be saving them from the exposure. As far as my kids are concerned, everybody who comes home is a TV or a film star so, my kids are very balanced. If I knew it would affect them in anyway adversely, I would not attempt it."
 
 Her show "Mini Me", to air soon, showcases the mother-daughter duo travel across multiple countries in Europe, trying food halts and doing some not-so touristy things.
 
 In the unique travelogue, they will be seen travelling through Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Montenegro, Croatia and Spain.
 
 The show is also produced by Mini Mathur.
 
 She says it was "daunting" and was a tough learning process.
 
 "But it felt like I went to film school," she quipped.
