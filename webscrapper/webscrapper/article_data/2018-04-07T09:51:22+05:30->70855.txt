IDUKKI: While the land conversion bid in   is   in the state, the government has failed to take action against the KSEB land encroachment at Pallivasal near Munnar.

 In January 2017, former Devikulam sub-collector   had submitted a detailed report to the district collector seeking urgent intervention to reclaim the government land.
 
 “Over 30 acres of KSEBownedland was encroached at Pallivasal and sold to the resort mafia. Several   constructed resorts on the land. Over 30 title deeds which have been issuedfor the KSEB land have been handed over to private parties. As per the records, over 27.17 acres of land have already been handedover tothem . The encroachments happened in the last 30 years. Over 196 acres of land was owned by KSEB near Pallivasal power house,” said the report. The collector submitted the report to the government and it was sent back to the collector, seeking more details.
 
 “Earlier, I had directed Devikulam sub-collector to take action against the encroachment. The action should be taken at the tehsildar level. I willcheck the present statusof the issue,” Idukki district collector G R Gokulsaid.
 
 Now, officials at Devikulam are busy distributing NOCs for various activities and thisisthe reason of thedelayin taking action againstthe land encroachment, said Gokul.
 
 Revenue sources say that many big groups had bought land at Pallivasal and the government was allegedlying try to protect them. Sreeram Venkitaraman's report clearly pointed out serious malpractices behind the land deal. Over 30 resorts have been constructed there, most of them having eight to 13 storeys which can’t be acceptable in an economically fragile area like Pallivasal which isconsideredtobeone withhigh chancesof land slide.
 
 “Some former KSEB officials had encroached upon the government land and they managed to get title deeds.   also helped them in this regard. After collecting title deeds, these officials sold out the land to private parties,” said the report.
