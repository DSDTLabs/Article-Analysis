NEW DELHI: World-renowned sand artist   today created a moving tribute to mothers all over the world with his Mother's Day sculpture that says 'Your Love is an Ocean'

 The scuplture shows a smiling mother and child framed within the symbol of love - a heart. Pattnaik has situated the work on his favourite beach in Puri,  .
 
  
  
 It was on May 9, 1914, that US President   officially signed a proclamation declaring the second Sunday of May "a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country", Time magazine reported recently.
 
 Unofficially, though, the celebration of the modern Mother's Day began with a woman called  , who in 1908 sent 500 carnations to a church in her hometown, to honour her late mother Ann, said Time.
 
 Pattnaik's sculpture, situated next to an ocean, symbolises the boundless and depthless love of all mothers for their children.
 
  
  
  Earlier this week, the gifted artist created the world's longest sand sculpture of the Buddha, in Sri Lanka. He created the sculpture on the occasion of the 14th International Vesak Day Celebrations in Colombo. Vesak Day is also called Budhha Day or Buddha Purnima.
 
  
  
 In February, Pattnaik added yet another feature to his cap by storming into Guinness World Records for having created the world's tallest sand castle on Puri beach.
