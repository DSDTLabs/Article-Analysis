CHENNAI: The police on Friday arrested a 36-year-old man, saying he had murdered his wife before trying to make it appear that she died of a heart attack suffered while attempting suicide at their house in Maduravoyal. Investigators altered the case and registered it under IPC Section 302 (murder) based on a preliminary postmortem report. A court later sent   to jail.

 The police said Srinivasan, a plumber, had lodged a complaint at the Maduravoyal station on Thursday night, saying his wife Indirani, 33, tried to kill herself, had a heart attack and died.
 
 A team of police personnel examined the body and found injures around the neck. But Srinivasan claimed that she had been upset over the mounting debts they had run up. The woman’s parents who were not convinced with his reply lodged a police complaint alleging foul play in the death. After receiving a preliminary postmortem report, police questioned him.
 
 During interrogation, Srinivasan confessed to killing Indirani and trying to stage a drama of her death.
 
 Investigations revealed that the two had been childless for more than six years and the woman picked up quarrel with him over the matter. Srinivasan did not have a steady job and the couple kept borrowing money to pay rent and also to meet daily expenses. “They struggled to repay the money when they began blaming each other,” said an investigating officer. On Thursday night, he allegedly smashed her head against a wall and strangled her with a towel. After she collapsed, he called neighbours for help. “When they came in, they saw him holding his wife and weeping uncontrollably. It was an attempt to make people believe she died of natural cause,” said a police officer.
 
 The neighbours believed him and alerted the police.
