 The child’s parents were married in 2008. A few months later, the woman converted to Islam and the child was born in 2009. The couple moved to Dubai for work, while the child was left in the care of the paternal grandmother. In March 2013, the father strangled his wife in Dubai and was convicted for murder. He is facing death by a firing squad. Subsequently, the child’s maternal grandmother applied for custody, which the paternal side refused.
