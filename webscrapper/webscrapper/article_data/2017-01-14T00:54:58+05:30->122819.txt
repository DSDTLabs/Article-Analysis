CHENNAI: Citing high number of road accidents and in a bid to improve road safety standards in  , a public interest litigation filed in the Madras high court has sought enforcement of stringent Indian Roads   (IRC) guidelines and site selection norms for   along   in the state. 

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice M Sundar, before which the PIL of advocate VBR Menon came up for admission, has issued notices and ordered that the case should be listed again on February 27 for further hearing.
 
 In his petition, Menon said Indian Roads Congress, (IRC) comprising experts drawn from road transport and allied sectors in India, had framed guidelines (IRC:12:2009) for access, location and layout of roadside fuel stations and service stations. 
 
 The norms will ensure free flow of traffic on roads near fuel stations and minimum interference by vehicles using fuel stations. Non-conformity of norms and non-maintenance of deceleration lane, acceleration lane, service road, drainage system, channelisers, markings, signs and other traffic control devices in good operating conditions would make the fuel station liable to be de-energised, the guidelines said.
 
 Narrating the norms, Menon said the ministry, as well as oil companies, had not taken any steps to enforce the circular in Tamil Nadu and added that it was necessary in future to insist on compliance of the guidelines by all existing oil retail outlets to ensure public safety and security. He said at present there are no prescribed guidelines or transparent criteria for issuing no-objection certificates (NOC) by state revenue authorities for site approvals to start roadside fuel stations in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 "This is resulting in the arbitrary exercise of powers by revenue authorities without giving due attention to traffic conditions and safety of vehicles and public," Menon said.
