PATNA: A block development officer (BDO) in   district was mercilessly thrashed and held hostage in his official chamber by a group of villagers including women on Thursday.

 The villagers alleged that Pateri Belsar block BDO Ashok Kumar was involved in misappropriation of funds in collusion with the panchayat mukhiya, meant for construction of water supply pipelines and drainage under the ‘Saat Nischay’ scheme of chief minister Nitish Kumar
 
 Belsar outpost in charge VD Dubey said, “A large number of villagers including women from ward number eight of the block barged into the BDO’s office and thrashed him. The incident occurred around 2.30 pm and villagers created ruckus for almost an hour. They left the venue only after policemen reached the spot.”
 
 A video grab of the incident has also gone viral wherein the BDO was shown helplessly flailing his arms as women slapped and punched him, pulled his hair and tore his shirt to shreds.
 
 While talking to newsmen, ward member Neelam Devi said that she was called by the BDO and panchayat mukhiya to sign some cheques for disbursal for funds. “I was made to sign several blank cheques which I could not count,” she alleged.
 
 Dubey said as soon as the villagers got to know of it, they reached the BDO office and created a ruckus. “The BDO is yet to lodge an FIR in connection with the incident. Even none from the opposite side have approached police,” he added.
