NEW DELHI. The   president   today expressed his willingness to become the prime minister (PM) if the grand old party emerges as the single largest outfit in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

  “Yes, why not!” said Gandhi in a brief interaction with media on the sidelines of Samriddh Bharat event in Bengaluru.
 
 Earlier, the Gandhi scion had asserted that he was confident that the   would lose 2019 elections.
 
 "I am convinced that   won't remain PM in 2019 as the BJP is unlikely to form government come next year," he said.
 
  This is not the first time when 47-year-old Congress chief made his ambition of becoming PM clear. 
 
  In September last year, while speaking to students in Berkley university in US, Gandhi had said he was "absolutely ready" to be the party's prime ministerial candidate for the 2019 general elections.
 
 The Congress president today also launched an attack on PM Modi over choosing what he alleged a corrupt person as Karnataka's chief ministerial candidate.
 
 "We are repeatedly asking the PM why he chose an individual tainted with corruption as their CM face? Why has he given tickets to the Bellary Reddy brothers, who have looted exchequer of Rs 35,000 crore?" questioned Gandhi.
