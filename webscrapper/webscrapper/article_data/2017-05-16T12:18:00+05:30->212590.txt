BAREILLY: Police investigating a case of fraud filed against a conman Deepak Yadav, arrested last month for duping a man of Rs 10 lakh, has revealed that the accused is likely to have robbed crores of rupees from people across four districts of the state. The revelation, which came on Monday, was made after several victims came forward claiming they were robbed of lakhs of rupees by   who had promised attractive returns on investments in his business.
 
  Police said that an FIR was initially filed by a victim named Ankit   in April this year after which Yadav was arrested. According to some of the complainants, Yadav took people into confidence by returning some amount of money as profit dividends, luring them to make further investments.
  
  “Yadav stopped paying the installments after which I became suspicious. It was only later when I came to know that he had no business of his own,” said Rastogi, who had filed an FIR in April.
  
  “We were acquaintances for a long time and he floated an offer to me. Yadav claimed that he had landed a contract with the Air Force, which promised huge profit margins,” said Gaurav Sharma, a resident of  .
  
  Many of those duped are residents of Badaun, Moradabad, Ghaziabad and other adjoining districts.
  
  Sources also claimed that this was only tip of the iceberg and that there are many others yet to report about the robbery. “Many had not kept record of the transactions because of their close ties with the accused. Without any document as evidence, they are helpless in filing complaints against Yadav,” said another victim, who did not wish to be named.
