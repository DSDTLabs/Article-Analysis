NAVI MUMBAI: The entry-exit stretch on the Ghansoli end of   has been witnessing for long massive bottlenecks due to encroachments.

 The vital link between these two nodes has been squeezed to almost half, said local residents who have been using this route for decades. 
 
 The encroachments have taken a toll on the commuters who have been facing a tough time to negotiate this stretch. Traffic jams are a regular features in the narrow entry-exit point of Ghansoli end. 
 
 “Once you get stuck in the corner which connects Ghansoli village road, there’s no other way to get out of the serpentine queue,” said Talvali resident  .
 
 For residents of Koparkhairane, Ghansoli, Talvali,   and  , this   happens to be an ideal link for those who want to avoid the busy Thane-Belapur road. 
 
 Those travelling from Vashi and Thane too take this route to do away with Thane-Belapur road traffic but sometimes get stuck. 
 
 “Since it’s an internal road, traffic cops are hardly seen to streamline the vehicular flow. Earlier, four-wheelers and motorcycles would easily pass through this entire stretch at the same time,” said Airoli resident Sujit Mhatre.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner   said, “We will have to look at the encroachments after studying the development plan. If this is the case, we will surely take up the road widening work on priority.”
