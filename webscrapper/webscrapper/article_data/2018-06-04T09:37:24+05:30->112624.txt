SYDNEY: International   ( ) has revised its forecast for airline industry’s collective   on the back of rising fuel and labour cost. The airline trade body on Monday announced a collective net profit of $33.8 billion (4.1% net margin) in 2018 as against the earlier forecast of $38.4 billion, which was made in December 2017.

 
 "This is a solid performance despite rising costs, primarily fuel and labor, but also the upturn in the interest rate cycle. These rising costs are the main driver behind the downward revision from the previous forecast of $38.4 billion in December 2017,’’ said IATA. 
 
 IATA represents over 80 % of   in the world.
 
 In 2017 airlines earned a record $38.0 billion (revised from the previously estimate of $34.5 billion). Comparisons to this, however, are severely distorted by special accounting items such as one-off tax credits which boosted 2017 profits.
 
 "Profits at the operating level, though still high by past standards, have been trending slowly downwards since early 2016, as a result of accelerating costs,’’ it added.
 
 "Solid profitability is holding up in 2018, despite rising costs. The industry’s financial foundations are strong with a nine-year run in the black that began in 2010. And the return on invested capital will exceed the cost of capital for a fourth consecutive year. At long last, normal profits are becoming normal for airlines. This enables airlines to fund growth, expand employment, strengthen balance sheets and reward our investors," said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.
 
 In 2018, the return on invested capital is expected to be 8.5% (down from 9% in 2017). This still exceeds the average cost of capital, which has risen to 7.7% on higher bond yields (7.1% in 2017). This is critical for attracting the substantial capital needed by the industry to expand its fleet and services.
