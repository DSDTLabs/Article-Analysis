PATNA:   has scoffed at attempts to decribe the event of CM   colouring a sketch of lotus drawn by her as a pointer to his  .
 
  The event took place at the inauguration of 11-day   on Saturday. The   doyenne, who was awarded Padma Shri this Republic Day, also attended the inaugural ceremony.
  
  “What politics? Mithila paintings originally depicted images of lotus, bamboo grove, fishes, birds and snakes, which together symbolised fertility and life. When I was asked to draw something for the CM, the first thing that came to my mind was lotus as it represents the customary female face,” Baua Devi said on Tuesday, adding the organisers did not tell her to draw or not to draw lotus and it was just a coincidence that she drew lotus as she is also a female.
  
  According to her, lotus is in the centre even when ‘kohbar ghar’, where newlywed couple spend their first three nights without cohabiting, is decorated by the bride family’s womenfolk with symbolic images. These images represent fertility and proliferation of life, she said.
  
  Sociologist Hetukar Jha nodded. “Lotus’s association with Maithil tradition is age old. Drawing political inference from a frame of CM using his painting brush on a lotus drawn by a Madhubani painter is only sensationalising a non-issue,” the academic told TOI on Tuesday.
  
  Former JD (U) spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary is fuming at, what he said, “bid to question the political integrity” of Nitish. “I saw a post on Facebook and immediately checked with the concerned. I was told the CM just honoured the Padma awardee by colouring her sketch of lotus, which happens to be the saffron party’s election symbol,” he said.
  
  Tiwary, a former Bihar minister and MP, asserted Nitish didn’t form the grand alliance to ditch it later and join the BJP with which he parted ways because of its new-found love for Narendra Modi. “Isn’t the BJP still led by Modi for all practical purposes?” Tiwary asked.
