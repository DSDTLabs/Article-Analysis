In the latest episode of America Ammayi, Adithya in Surya’s disguise challenges the latter’s sister Padma to eat the poisoned food and prove her innocence. While Padma is about to eat, Sam interferes and takes the challenge on her behalf. Surprisingly, Sam survives and proves to the family that the food is not poisoned and Padma has been unnecessarily blamed.

 Adithya has a subsequent realisation that Sam replaced his poisoned ghee bottle with an identical bottle of pure ghee. Sam rebukes Adithya in front of the family for all the false allegations he made on Padma. But after quickly grasping that Surya’s image is at stake, Sam tries a quick damage control measure by lying that all this was a part of their April fool prank.
 
 Padma buys Sam’s lie and requests Surya not to try this again as she is very sensitive. Samanya blames Surya’s absurd behavior to be Sam’s drug effect. Adithya asks about the questionable drink she (Sam) gave him the other day.
 
 Samanya quickly underlines that her allegations finally turned true. Jayanthi admonishes Sam for lying to her about Surya’s health.
 
 Adithya’s plan was good but not perfect and victorious Sam taunts him for his failure. Displeased Adithya cautions to bounce back with a better blow very soon.
 
 Following this episode, drunk Adithya steps into Surya’s office. He slaps his manager for not wishing him good morning. And much to the staff’s astonishment, he addresses them with utmost adamance. Adding to this, Adithya misbehaves with one of his female employees and passes lewd remarks.
