Navi Mumbai: The Koparkhairane traffic in-charge has asked the deputy municipal commissioner (zone 2) to   the size of a   circle in Ghansoli located along the arterial road from the railway station to Gharonda complex. 

 The traffic cop has claimed that the wide circumference of the island has been causing a bottleneck, especially when   and BEST buses take a turn round the circle. There are also have been incidents of vehicles grazing or bumping into each other at this spot, leading to verbal spats between motorists.
 
 “A bottleneck is created even if a bus and a car ply on the narrow road abut the circle, blocking the path for other vehicles. Hence, we have suggested to the   deputy commissioner of zone 2 to reduce the circumference of the island,” senior inspector Sachin Khondre said.
