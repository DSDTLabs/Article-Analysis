Mumbai: The eight-year-old girl who is battling serious head injuries after a 2kg tava fell on her head in Nagpada was shifted to the   at Marine Lines from   on Sunday. Doctors said  's condition continues to be critical but stable.

 A   that was carried out on Sunday evening revealed that the parts of skull bone have broken and gone inside the brain. Neurosurgeon   said that although the girl’s injury was serious, there is no imminent danger to her life. 
 
 “She is unconscious and intermittently opening her eyes. She is also moving her legs in pain. It's a good sign in such cases where some reaction is better than no reaction. It shows that even though the skull fracture is in the motor area, she has probably escaped any serious damage,” he said. The child has been put on ventilator and is being treated in the neurology ICU of the south Mumbai hospital. The doctor said her external wounds were sutured immediately and that itself reduced her chances of suffering an infection. “The good thing is that children do better than adults,” he said. The doctors may be planning a surgery once her condition improves. He, however, said her recovery may take a while. 
 
 On Friday morning, when the class III student of St Joseph's school in Agripada was returning home from tuitions, a griddle fell on her from the 20-storey Danish Villa in Madanpura. The Nagpada police are investigating how and from which floor the griddle fell. At least a dozen families have come under scrutiny.
