NOIDA: More than a dozen sectors in Noida — 6, 9, 16, 20, 22, 23, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, as well as Bhangel, Morna and areas near   mall — were without power for over three hours on Wednesday afternoon due to a ‘current transmission (CT) blast’ at 220 kV substation at Sector 20. 

 Residents had to spend their afternoon in scorching 44 degrees Celsius heat as power was finally restored around 3.30 pm after repair work was completed.
 
 Ravinder Kumar, SDO (transmission) at Sector 129 substation, who also works at Sector 20 substation, said there was a CT blast in the transmission line coming from   at 220 kV substation in Sector 20 around noon. “We resumed emergency services and supply to hospitals and malls through Sector 129 substation, while repair work continued at the 220 kV substation in Sector 20,”   told TOI.
 
 Even though the outage went on for three hours, PVVNL superintending engineer Vivek Aggarwal claimed that the attempt to complete repair work began almost immediately after the disruption happened in the transmission line. 
 
 “While CT repair work began soon, we managed to source power from neighbouring sectors’ substations to ensure non-disruption of emergency services at hospitals,” said Aggarwal.
