HYDERABAD: Continued protests at the   ( ), Hyderabad, seems to be stemming from accumulated anger and frustration of the students over not only financial aid but also lack of basic amenities and infrastructure at the two campuses in the city.

 The students at the   and   campuses have been on strike for the past four days. Students claim that it is not just the fund cut but also absence of quality facilities such as hostels, mess, infrastructure, library, security that has left them high and dry.
 
 
 Students claim that the two campuses have been functioning out of rented buildings with minimum amenities and infrastructure since its establishment. “We have represented our concerns over poor infrastructure. We have asked the administration to provide us with a permanent campus with better facilities. But our concerns have not been considered till date,” said Kalyani J, a student of public policy and government.
 
 Students also rue that services such as hostel and mess have been outsourced. “The dining and hostel facilities are not up to the mark as they are outsourced to private agencies. Despite raising multiple complaints, the administration has turned blind eye towards it,” said Lokesh Middi, a student of rural development and governance.
 
 Even faculty members have raised concerns over the operations and conditions on campus. “Most of the assistant professors and associate professors, who are working on contract basis, are unhappy with the present way of functioning. But none of them are voicing their dissent for fear of disciplinary action,’ said KP Rakesh, assistant professor,   at TISS, Rajendra Nagar campus.
