PATNA: The decision taken by the   (CBSE) to make a health and physical education class every day mandatory for students of classes IX to XII has garnered mixed response in Patna.

 According to sources, the board has prepared a 150-page manual containing sports guidelines and methodologies. During the sports period, students will have to go to the playground and perform some physical activity. They will later be graded, but there will be no exams.
 
 Several city schools claimed that the mandatory physical education class would affect their timetable. “All CBSE-affiliated schools have been told to conduct one game and sports class for students every day. This means they will have to adjust the timetable in such a way that other classes do not suffer and the teacher is not overburdened,” said a Notre Dame Academy official on Monday and added the school needed more physical education teachers.
 
 Raj Kumar, a sports teacher of Dr G L Dutta DAV-Transport Nagar, told this reporter, “I appreciate the CBSE’s move to prevent growing obesity among schoolchildren. However, we have only one playground and four sports teachers. So, it will be difficult to conduct sports classes for so many students.”
 
 Students, on the other hand, welcomed the board’s decision. Loyola High School’s Rashmi Rathi said, “I love playing table-tennis and have won many prizes at state level competitions. Being a Class X student, I thought I wouldn’t get enough time for my favourite game this year. I am happy that the CBSE took such a step.”
 
 Litera Valley School, which has nine sports teachers, two playgrounds, a three-storey indoor sports complex and a newly inaugurated Revolution Cricket Academy, is all set to conduct sports classes for its students.
 
 “We can hold four health and physical education classes simultaneously. Sports plays an important role in the overall development of young people,” said school headmistress Shabnam Bhowmick.
