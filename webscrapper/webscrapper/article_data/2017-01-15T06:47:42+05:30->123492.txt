 Missing names was a major issue in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. So a special enrolment programme was carried out, with the names of voters getting updated for the last two years. 
 
 While the administration claims to have updated the records, citizens’ groups paint a different picture, saying that there are discrepancies in the addresses and spellings, causing worries for the voters. 
 
 “Many citizens who have updated their names in the voters list do not find their names because of changed spellings. This will only increase voter apathy,” said stated D M Rao, who had applied for a change in surname, and has yet to check the updated list. 
 
 The updated list will be printed on January 25, which is the National Voters’ Day. 
 
 There was a 50% voter turnout in the 2012 municipal council elections, so the SEC has targetted a 70% turnout this time around, and has instructed the 10 municipal corporations to plan programmes to mobilise citizens to vote on February 21.
