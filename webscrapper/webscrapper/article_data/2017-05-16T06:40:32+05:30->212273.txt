MUMBAI: The Centre has failed the country not only on its borders but also in matters of internal security, said Saamna on Monday .In an editorial, the   mouthpiece slammed central agencies for not keeping track of 26 Pakistani visitors to the city who have been reported missing.

 Stating that the Centre's response to security issues was “as cold as a block of ice“, the Marathi daily said   felt emboldened to carry out attacks along the border because of the government's limp-wristed policy on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.
 
 “The Centre's response to the   episode has been shockingly lukewarm. Islamabad is not willing to pay heed to the   on the   issue as we are not resolute enough while pursuing the case,“ the editorial said.
 
 Referring to the case of the missing Pakistanis, Sa amna squarely blamed the authorities for dereliction of duty .
 
 The Saamna editorial said: “The Pakistani nationals were issued visas by our security agencies. They ought to have thorough data on the Pakistani nationals' stay and their movements in Mumbai. This clearly shows that India lacks proper intelligence on matters of internal security as well... Hizbul, al-Qaida and the ISIS agents are supposed to clear the decks (to foment terrorism) in India and the `missing' Pakistani nationals are part of the entire game.“
 
 It said the BJP stance on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism was softed than that of the   regime.
