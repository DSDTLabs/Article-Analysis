Neil Nitin Mukesh’s   will now be remade in Tamil with the title Johnny. The film, we hear, will have Prashanth playing Neil’s role and   as the female lead. Prashanth’s father   will be producing the film with Vetriselvan, who worked as an associate in films like Yeman and Amara Kaaviyam, helming the project. 

 Talking about the film,   says, “The Hindi version was a hit and when I was approached for this film, I took it up as the female character has a solid role. I recently watched the original and will be giving my own twist to the role in its remake. I have already begun shooting for my portions and will wind up my portions by the end of this month.” The film’s cast also has Prabhu, Sayaji Shinde, Ashutosh Rana and Devadarshini, to name a few.
 Sanchita, who also has Venkat Prabhu’s Party, is quite excited about this film and says, “We will leave for Fiji in August for the shoot. I am not allowed to reveal any details about my role, but this is something I have never attempted before. And that makes it exciting for me.”
