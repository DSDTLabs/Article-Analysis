PATNA: The JD (U) has defended its former president and Rajya Sabha MP   and his controversial remark that “vote ki ijjat beti ki ijjat se badi hoti hai”.

 Addressing party workers at a function to commemorate former CM Karpoori Thakur on his birth anniversary in Patna on Tuesday, Sharad said, “If a daughter’s honour is compromised, it affects only the family and the village or the community, but if the vote’s honour is compromised, it impacts the entire nation.” 
 
 Party spokesman K C Tyagi regretted the remark was being misinterpreted. “He (Sharad) was explaining the significance of a vote. He did not intend to hurt the sentiments of women. We apologise If anyone is hurt,” he said. 
 
 Not that Sharad has made such an anti-woman comment for the first time. He made a controversial remark on Union minister Smriti Irani in 2015, but later said he respects her. 
 
 Sharad has in the past used the expression “prakati auratein” to refer to women while opposing quota for women in legislature. Last year, he belittled British filmmaker Leslee Udwin, whose documentary on the December 16 gang rape has sparked a heated debate, saying she must have got permissions for the shoots easily as “all doors open for fair-skinned women”.
 
 Talking to TOI, Tyagi sought to divert the issue by assailing the   for raising the issues of job reservation and Ram Mandir ahead of the polls in a few states. “Why isn’t the Election Commission taking cognizance against the BJP leaders who are again trying to use the temple issue as a political tool?” he wondered.
 
 On the JD (U)’s stand against Uniform Civil Code, Tyagi clarified the party favours open debate and discussions as the issue pertains to religious sentiments. “We left the   in 2013 because we feared the BJP’s new leadership would not toe Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s liberal line. Controversial issues should be addressed through consensus among stakeholders,” he said.
