CUTTACK: Almost six years after announcing the art gallery project, the   (CMC) is still searching for land to construct the gallery. 

 On August 31, 2011, on the occasion of self-governance day, chief minister   laid the foundation stone of the project in Choudhury Bazaar. But in the last so many years not a single brick has been laid on the site. And now the civic body feels that the land is not appropriate.
 
 "The selected land site is quite small and if the art gallery comes up at the place then it would not serve any purpose. We are searching for a bigger piece of land where we can construct an attractive art gallery with a heritage design," said CMC commissioner Gyana Das. The CMC commissioner said search for land is on and it will be finalized shortly.
 
 When asked about the inordinate delay in starting the project, Das replied, "Initially the project got delayed due to lack of funds and then objections were raised over the identified site. The project got stuck due to these problems".
 
 However, now the CMC plans to involve corporate houses to fund construction of the gallery that would cost around Rs 2 crore. It plans to take it up on public-private partnership mode.
 
 The art gallery project has been included in CMCs 2017-18 budget which will be placed in the council meeting on February 28. "We will try to take up construction of the project this year," said Das.
