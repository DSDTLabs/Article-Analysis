PATNA: State assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary paid tributes to the martyrs on the 99th anniversary of   massacre on Friday.

 Addressing a seminar organised by an NGO at Bihar Industries Association (BIA), Choudhary said, “After the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran satyagraha, it’s now time to observe the centenary of Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The two movements led to the country’s independence,” Choudhary said. He compared the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to Kalinga war. “Emperor Ashok chose the path of non-violence after the Kalinga war in which thousands of people were killed. In Jallianwala Bagh massacre too, unarmed citizens were killed by the then authoritarian government,” the Speaker said.
 
 “People had gathered to protest against the repressive Rowlatt Act at Jallianwla Bagh in Amritsar on April 13, 1919. Though the then British government officials had claimed that only 379 people were massacred, the fact is that more than 1,000 innocent people were killed on that fateful day. The event shook up the whole country and also fired up the freedom fighters,” Chaudhary said.
 
 Former vice-chancellor of Banaras Hindu University Girish Chandra Tripathi also spoke on the occasion.
