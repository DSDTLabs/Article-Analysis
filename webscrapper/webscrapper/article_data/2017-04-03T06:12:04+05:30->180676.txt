THRISSUR: Employees of   (ICH), a network of restaurants established by communist leader  , will strengthen the ongoing protest strike against the dismissal of the director board of the   employees   headquartered in Thrissur without prior notice.

 Over 2,000 employees working in ICHs spread in around eights district of the state are being part of the protest.
 
  “Some CITU employees have been working against the majority interest of the cooperative society, which runs without politics in it. As a part of the move, a new administrator was appointed to the society without prior notice,” said Suresh Damodharan, a   employee.
 
  Meanwhile, CITU members alleged that the society had been immersed in corruption of around Rs 38 crore and the director board was dismissed after inquiry.
 
  Since February 2017, the cooperative society has been going through an uncertainty and the bank accounts had been frozen due to the issue.
 
 “We haven’t got the salary this month and dues of various loans, building rents etc have to be paid for which a decision should be taken about the issue,” said Suresh. 
 
 He added that if the government did not interfere in the issue, we, along with our family, would conduct the strike in front of the secretariat.
