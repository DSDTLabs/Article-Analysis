MUMBAI:   on Sunday announced that the   cabinet would give one more chance to farmers who could not submit their loan waiver application. 

 The special campaign will go on throughout March. Fadnavis was addressing a news meet ahead of the Budget session of the legislature, which starts from Monday. 
 
  Fadnavis clarified on the loan waiver scheme’s status. “We received over 67 lakh applications from farmers under the scheme. More than 54 lakh applications have been cleared and the funds have been given to banks for over 46 lakh accounts. Nearly 13 lakh applications were forwarded to the taluka committees for scrutiny,” said Fadnavis. “Those who could not submit their loan waiver application for various reasons can apply from March 1 to 31,” he said. 
 
 Fadnavis warned that district cooperative central banks (DCCBs) could be dissolved if they charged interest to farmers for the duration between the announcement of the loan waiver scheme and actual disbursement.
 
 Clarifying on the assistance to be given to farmers affected from hailstorms and pink bollworm attack, Fadnavis said the survey has been completed and actual disbursement is in process. The state has demanded Rs 2,400 crore aid from the Union government.“The government has helped farmer Dharma Patil’s family by making ex-gratia payment as there is no provision in the law to make changes once the compensation for the land acquisition has been accepted,” he said. Patil committed suicide by consuming poison in Mantralaya. 
 
 He also announced that the work on the Development Plan 2034 will be completed by March 31.
