MOHALI: A masked man with a bag slung on his shoulders walked into a bank in Phase VII, brandished a gun and walked out with Rs 6.5 lakh in a broad daylight   that was over in 60 seconds on Tuesday.

 Around 2.30 pm right after lunch, a woman clerk, a peon, cashier, manager and a customer were present in the   when the robber with a handkerchief covering his face entered. He directly approached the cashier and pointed the gun, ordering him to go and bring the cash while handing him over the bag. At the same time, he asked the manager not to leave his cabin.
 
 The bank employees put the cash in the bag and handed it over to the accused. While walking out, the robber dropped something but immediately turned back and showed the gun to the employees before running away, said police. The cashier and the peon ran behind him in an attempt to catch him but to no avail.
 
 The accused had parked his car around 50 metre away from the bank, where no   cameras are installed. A man running a juice shop and the bank peon tried to smash his car’s windshield but failed. They, however, managed to grab the bumper of the car that finally broke. The peon also suffered a leg injury.
 
 The bank informed the police within two minutes of the incident.
 
 The bank has had no security guard ever since it became operational, said police sources. Phase VII station house officer   said, “The accused had snatched the car of a person to carry out the crime. He had also changed its registration number plate. We are verifying why there was no security guard in the bank. We are scanning the footage to obtain key clues.”
