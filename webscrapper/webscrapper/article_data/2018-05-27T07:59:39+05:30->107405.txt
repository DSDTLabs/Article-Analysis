Fittingly, the teams that finished first and second are in the final. They were just that little bit better than the others when it mattered and deserve their place at the high dining table.

 
 
 
 History shows that the team that finishes second in the league generally goes on to win the trophy, and by that token, CSK’s supporters will be confident that their beloved team will complete a fairytale comeback by winning the coveted cup. Having won a nail-biting encounter against the Sunrisers to get direct entry into the final, they will be buoyant with the confidence.
 
 
 
 The Sunrisers batting does not have the depth that Chennai has, and so, is reliant on Dhawan and Williamson. One man, though, gets better and better by the day and as he showed against the KKR, he can be a one-man army. Rashid Khan’s blistering innings gave SRH just the push it needed and lifted their spirits. He played fabulous shots and the de Villiers-like flick shot was the best of them all. Then with the ball in his hand, he once again wove magic and had the batsmen tied to their crease.
 
  
  
 As if that was not enough, he took two fine catches in the deep and effected a run-out with a bullet like throw right on top of the stumps.
