PATNA: Neither the leader of opposition in the   Tejashwi Prasad Yadav nor any representative of his party   participated in the all-party meet convened by the state assembly Speaker   on Friday in the run up to the budget session to discuss matters related to the smooth running of the house. 

 Over monthlong session is to begin on February 26 with the address of governor Satya Pal Malik to the joint session of the state assembly and legislative council. The session will end on April 4.
 
 Sources said the representatives of JD(U), BJP, Congress, CPI(ML), RLSP and LJP participated in the meeting. “Normally, leaders of legislature parties or their representatives participate in the meeting on the eve of the budget session or any house session to discuss matters related to its smooth functioning,” sources said.
 
 “Tejashwi was out of the town. Therefore, he could not attend the meeting,” sources said, adding: “At times, it happens.” Tejashwi is on ‘Samvidhan Bachao Nyaya Yatra’ in several districts. 
 
 Among the participants in the Saturday meet were ministers Shrawan Kumar and Bijendra Prasad Yadav from JD(U), Sadanand Singh from Congress, Mehboob Alam from CPI(ML), Raju Tiwari from LJP and Sudhanshu Kumar from RLSP. BJP’s chief whip   reached there only after the meeting was over.
 
 The sources said all the participants were in agreement that there should be smooth running of the house. Also, that all the parties have equal stakes for raising the matters of public importance on the floor of the house, seeking government’s response and reply.
