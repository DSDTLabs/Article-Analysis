HYDERABAD: One in every 10   in Hyderabad and elsewhere in the country could be suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), says a new nationwide study .Out of every 10 women diagnosed with this condition, six are girls in their teens, says the just-released study conducted by the department of endocrinology and metabolism,   ( ).

 PCOS is a common disorder of the endocrinal system in women of reproductive age. Up to 25% of women in the childbearing age suffer from PCOS, the study says. Women who suffer from PCOS have higher than normal insulin levels and such an increase in the level of insulin can make ovaries produce more androgens such as testos terone. These women struggle with weight issues, complicating the disorder further. If left unchecked or undiagnosed, PCOS can lead to infertility and other long-term health issues.
 
 “PCOS can lead to the deve lopment of cysts as the ovaries are unable to release eggs on time. As a result, follicles keep growing and form multiple cysts, which appear like 'a string of pearls'. Women are more likely to develop PCOS if their mother or sister have it,“ Dr K K Aggarwal, national president   (IMA) said. “Symptoms can begin shortly after puberty and reach into early adulthood.Young girls with PCOS tend to have irregular periods or amenorrhea, and heavy or scanty bleeding. PCOS can also make women vulnerable to other complications like hypertension, high cholesterol, anxiety and depression, sleep apnea, heart attacks, diabetes and endometrial, ovarian and breast cancer,“ said Dr RN Tandon, secretary general, IMA.
 
 Doctors say PCOS cannot be cured, but it can be managed with lifestyle changes such as losing up to 5% to 10% of body weight. “PCOS is an urgent public health problem... The best possible way to manage this is exercise and a healthy diet,“ said Dr Aggarwal.
