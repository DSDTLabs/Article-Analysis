GURUGRAM:   students in the city claimed that the  , trickier and more difficult as compared to those from the past years.

 The changed pattern of the exam left most students dumbfounded on Wednesday, who were expecting the question paper to follow the same pattern as in the past. Most were seen distraught with their performance in the exam hall.
 
 “I was expecting an easier paper but was caught by surprise,” said Manav Goyal, a student. “I got one question wrong. Otherwise, the paper was good but quite lengthy. There was this question related to cash flow which was problematic. Not everyone wrote the correct answer. We never practiced such questions. Generally, sub-parts of a question are given on one of two topics but today, many topics were touched upon. It led to confusion, and we ended up consuming a lot of time solving it.”
 
 “One question was problematic as students could not tally their answers,” said Supreet Kaur, a student from DPS Sector 45. “There were some questions that students had not expected.” 
 
 Accounts teachers too felt that the paper was a trickier this year. The exam pattern has changed as compared to the previous years. This may have caught students unawares,” said Aakash Nangia, who teaches Accounts at a private tuition centre in Gurgaon. 
 
 Then there were some students who found the paper to be the finest that they have seen so far. “Today’s paper tested our conceptual knowledge. I did well,” said Ranvijay Singh from Suncity School.
