VADODARA: A real estate developer and a husband-wife duo, who cheated an old woman of Rs 20 lakh, were booked by the Gotri police station following directions from the   high court.

 The victim Lilabati Sinha (63) had purchased a house on Gotri Road from the developer Rajeev   in 2007. According to Sinha, Sheth had initially planned to sell the house to Kirtidev Khatri and his wife Meeta but the couple turned down the plan as the civil work was not over. He then decided to sell the property to Sinha, she told the police in her complaint.
 
 After they finalized the deal, Sinha gave Sheth Rs 14.5 lakh in different amounts for which she was given receipts. Later, she was also given allotment and possession letters. But he never signed the sale deed. Sinha then filed a civil suit in a civil court. The judgement in the case has not been delivered yet.
 
 In 2014, State Bank of India (SBI) officials were to attach the property as the couple had taken a loan amount of Rs 5.5 lakh against the house. To avoid that Sinha even repaid the loan amount. Last year, Sinha got another attachment notice from   for another loan which the couple had taken against the property.
 
 Later, Sinha gave an application for registering the complaint against the trio to Gotri police station. When her complaint was not registered, she approached the High Court. The High Court then recently passed order asking the police to register Sinhaâ€™s FIR against Sheth and the couple.
