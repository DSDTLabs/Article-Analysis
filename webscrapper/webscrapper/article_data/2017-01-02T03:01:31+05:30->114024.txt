MYSURU: A day after he was reported missing,   activist Srinath’s body was found in the   river near Srirangapatna in   on Friday evening. “We believe that the perpetrators killed him elsewhere.

 They rolled up his body in a carpet, and dumped him in the river near the Nimishamba temple. Srinath’s body bore multiple stab wounds,” police said. A resident of Rajarajeshwari Nagar,   worked as an electric contractor. He left home on Thursday at about 7.30pm, accompanied by an engineer,  , and a worker, Kumar, to attend to work in south Mysuru, the family members said.
 
 Srinath’s brother Pradeep said that he couldn’t reach the former’s phone after 7.30pm on Thursday. “When he didn’t return home, we filed a missing person complaint at the Kuvempu Nagar police station on Friday morning,” he told TOI. 
 
 Hours after the complaint was filed, police recovered his body from the Cauvery river. “We hope the cops soon bring the culprits to justice,” Pradeep said. A postmortem was performed on Saturday at the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, following which Srinath’s mortal remains were cremated.
 
 His family members and friends claimed that Srinath had exposed misappropriation of funds in layouts, which were being developed by the workers’ union attached to a central government agency.
 
 “He had also informed the anti-corruption bureau about certain officials who had amassed wealth illegally,” his friends said. A senior police officer in Mandya said two teams had been formed to investigate the murder. “We are confident of solving the case soon,” he said.
 
 An RTI activist, requesting anonymity, said, “We are trying to help the government, by exposing corrupt activities. His death has left us disturbed.”
