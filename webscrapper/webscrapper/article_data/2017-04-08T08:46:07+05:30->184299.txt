SURAT:  , a veteran Congress leader from the   of Dadra and Nagar Haveli (DNH), who is popular among the adivasis of south Gujarat, may join BJP during the visit of Prime Minister   in DNH on April 17. If Delkar, a six-time MP from DNH from 1989, joins the BJP, it will be a big blow to the Congress ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in Gujarat.

  He had fought Lok Sabha elections as an independent candidate twice and won, contested on Congress ticket twice and was also BJP candidate in 1998. He had worked hard in the tribal areas to ensure the victory of Congress candidates in the last elections. It was due to his efforts along with other tribal leaders like   that the Congress candidates could manage to win in Vansda, Dharampur, Kaprada, Dang and Vyara constituencies.
 
 After losing in the Lok Sabha elections from DNH in 2014 to BJP’s Natu Patel, Delkar had become politically dormant. Delkar is learnt to have provided his college ground on Sayli Road in Silvassa for the construction of a helipad for the landing of Prime Minister Modi’s chopper. Modi could announce Delkar’s plan to join the BJP during his visit. 
 
 Delkar camp have kick-started the preparations to mobilize people from across DNH and surrounding tribal areas in Valsad and Dang districts for the public meeting of Modi. 
 
 “There is a strong possibility of Delkar joining the BJP. Prime Minister Modi and BJP president Amit Shah have given the slogan for a ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’ and so are hunting down Congress leaders,” said a Congress leader in the Union territory.
