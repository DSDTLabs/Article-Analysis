 My retweets are endorsements of my leaders' statements. I believe a healthy democracy is where everyone's point of view is heard. It's for people to reflect and observe their thoughts and become aware. That's how societies evolve.
 
 
 We definitely need more voices and are working towards that. Our focus has diversified -we are trying to develop a core platform to reach out to the masses, understand their problems and bring their voices out in the open. Our volunteers have taken up the challenge to tackle the manipulative tactics of the present dispensation at the Centre and ensure good governance prevails.
 
 
 We will not be drawn into guerrilla marketing techniques, as employed by our competitor. False propaganda machinery and unethical tactics are being used by the parties in power to stifle the common man's voice and divert people's focus from the real issues. I believe Rahul Gandhi will be the future leader of the country, even without false propaganda.We want to connect, listen, engage and convey our message to people. We have picked up speed and are well poised for the next elections.
 
 
 
 Our strategy to counter the present dispensation will be to integrate offline-online campaigns to broaden the spectrum, connect with new and existing voters, generate interest and desire for the party's initiatives, nurture a community of advocates for the party and engage with the youth to inspire them to contribute their bit.
 
 
 
 We have tapped digital channels and platforms and planned a dedicated volunteers' dashboard. We have employed social media channels to connect with the people across multiple touch points with a unified tone of messaging and engagement
