KOTTAYAM: The woman who abducted a 4-day-old boy from the district hospital in   hatched the plan to do so after she suffered two miscarriages, the police said. 

 She had sunk into depression and decided to abduct a baby to hold on to her male partner. The reasoning may sound like a plot line from a soap opera but the aftermath has been tragic.
 
  The woman even organized a grand party with her partner at her home in Vechoochira after abducting the baby but was arrested by cops the next day. 
 
 The police said the woman, identified as Beena, had got married in 2007 to a man from Kollam. The marriage turned sour and without getting legally separated from him she started staying with a man from Vechoochira. Their relationship was marked by frequent quarrels over her not having children. The woman told police that she decided to abduct a baby hoping to raise the child as her own.
 
 After lying to her live-in partner that she was pregnant she started scouting the hospital with the aim of abducting a new-born. Her initial plan was to steal the new-born twins of a woman admitted to the hospital. But it did not work out and then she zeroed in on the baby delivered by pastor Saji Chacko’s wife, Anitha. 
 
 After abducting the baby Beena went to Thekkemala in an autorickshaw and from there to Pathanamthitta in a KSRTC bus. From Pathanamthitta she then went to a relative’s house in  . Her live-in partner picked her up and the same night they went to their home in Vechoochira. 
 
 Sources said local residents at Vechoochira alerted police after hearing about the case of missing baby from the news media. 
 
 After the baby went missing police had examined the CCTVs at the hospital and had seen the woman walking away with the baby. They had also issued look-out notices against her. The woman has been remanded in judicial custody on Saturday.
