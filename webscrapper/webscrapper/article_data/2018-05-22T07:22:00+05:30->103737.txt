CHANDIGARH: The parliamentary standing committee on railways on Monday asked   officials why the travel time of   plying between Chandigarh and New Delhi has not been cut down by an hour after the Dappar-Chandigarh double lane track was open for traffic on March 22.

  
  
 Sudip Bandyopadhyay, chairman, parliamentary standing committee on railways, posed the query during an inspection of the Chandigarh railway station on Monday, wanting to know about the existing speed of the train.
 
 The railway officials responded that the speed could be increased if the crossings at some area were shut, which is under consideration. The committee told to work on the proposal and implement it at the earliest.
 
 The Ambala division had already submitted the project of cutting down the travel time and increasing the speed of the train from 110kmph to 130kmph. At present, there are three   trains plying between Chandigarh and New Delhi. The travel time is 3 hours and 25 minutes for two of the trains, while it is 3 hours and 27 minutes for the third.
 
 The committee also asked about the status of the semi-high speed train proposed between Chandigarh and New Delhi.
 
 Officials told the committee that SNCF, Franceâ€™s national state-owned railway company, has submitted its first report to the Union railway ministry, but the railway board was yet to take a final call.
 
 According to the report, the company proposed that trains could run at a speed limit of 160kmph or 200kmph by making modifications on the track. The estimated cost was Rs 45 crore per km for the semi-high speed project. The distance between Chandigarh and New Delhi is 244km.
 
 The committee also discussed the status of   train between Chandigarh and New Delhi, for which the schedule has already been announced. Railway officials informed the committee that rakes were not available due to which the train was yet to be started
