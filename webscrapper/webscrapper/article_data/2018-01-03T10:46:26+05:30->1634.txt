MUMBAI: The state government came under fire on Tuesday with   president   saying it had handled the situation in Koregaon Bhima in an inept manner.

 Pawar said law-enforcing agencies were not prepared to tackle the situation even when it was known that large numbers of people would be at the spot in Koregaon to mark 200 years of the famous battle. “So there was no end to rumour-mongering and confusion,” Pawar said.
 
 Pawar said he was told by villagers that while January 1 is celebrated as ‘victory day,’ members of pro-Hindutva organisations from Pune were camping in the Koregaon Bhima area for the past four-five days and instigating people.
 
 Leader of opposition Radhakrishna   blamed the government for its failure to take on organisations like Sanatan Sanstha and the Sambhaji Bhide-led Shivraj  .
 
 “Bhide and Milind Ekbote must be arrested and Fadnavis must ensure stern action is taken so that in future they do not indulge in such activities,” Vikhe Patil said.
 
 CM Devendra Fadnavis said adequate police personnel had been deployed. “Caste-based community riots were on the cards in the area, but the attempt was thwarted owing to the huge presence of police personnel. A few incidents of stonepelting and vehicles being set on fire were reported, but we still tackled the situation effectively,” he said.
 
 But a senior bureaucrat said preventive measures were not taken. “Activists of pro-Hindutva groups were camping in Koregaon for more than a week. In fact, Dalit activists from Pune had brought it to the notice of the police, but no action was taken against him or Bhide,” he said.
 
 The   is not quite keen on contesting the Dalit narrative of the battle of Koregaon Bhima, it is learnt. "The Sena will do nothing that may upset the Fadnavis regime," said a party veteran. Matoshree is of the view that the NCP could well be fuelling the conflict in order to destabilise Fadnavis, he added.
