BATHINDA: Though the controversial film ‘Nanak Shah Fakir’ has not been released in Punjab, there were protest against its screening in other states on Friday. Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) president and former MP Simranjit Singh Mann handed over memorandum to the   deputy commissioner in the name of Prime Minister and demanded not to allow the release of the film anywhere in India.

 Mann said the film was against the Sikh tenets. “The way the film has been shot using the characters which are very dear to the Sikh community has badly hurt the religious sentiments of the Sikhs and it should be banned,” he said.
 
 Sikh organisations held protest at Gidderbaha town of Muktsar against the release of the film in some states. Sarbat Khalsa-appointed jathedar of Talwandi Sabo Baljit Singh Daduwal spoke against the release of the movie. Daduwal said Sikhs could never tolerate anybody playing the character of their revered gurus and their family members. “We want the film to be pulled out from cinemas immediately,” he said.
 
 On April 11, the supreme temporal seat of Sikhs—Akal Takht—had banned the movie and excommunicated its producer   from the Sikh Panth.
