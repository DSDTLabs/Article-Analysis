NEW DELHI: One of the 20 MLAs facing disqualification in the ‘office-of-profit’ case is currently a cabinet minister in the Arvind Kejriwal government. Najafgarh MLA Kailash Gahlot emerged as the chief minister’s trusted colleague over the last three years.

 Since his elevation to the cabinet last year, Gahlot has been given key assignments ranging from revenue, transport, administrative reforms, information technology and law. The last one was a critical portfolio. Gahlot was projected by the   government as a strong face of the party representing rural Delhi. 
 
 The development has resulted in another law minister of the Kejriwal dispensation landing in hot water ever since it first came to power for 49 days in 2013. Back then, Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti had courted controversy after a midnight raid at Khirki village. 
 
 In 2015, the party appointed Tri Nagar MLA   as law minister. He was later sacked following his arrest in a fake degree case. The portfolio was then given to Karawal Nagar MLA Kapil Mishra. But it was later taken away from him by deputy CM  , who kept it with him until Gahlot’s elevation.
