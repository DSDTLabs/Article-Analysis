CHANDIGARH: The Haryana cabinet, which met under the chairmanship of chief minister  , on Wednesday approved the   (IILP) for development of integrated industrial colonies in industrial as well as agriculture zones.

 The policy is mainly focused on providing new options to boost manufacturing in the state and to introduce cluster development. One of the options is ‘Plug & play model’, which is to be operated on leasehold basis. 
 
 The model is expected to boost manufacturing as the built-in spaces already have basic facilities such as electricity and water and eliminates the need for complicated processes like land acquisition, infrastructure development and building construction. It will also help small and medium enterprises that do not want to go through the entire process of land acquisition and building factories. In a new start-up   where much of the investment is needed for land, the innovator is left with hardly any surplus to invest in technological innovation. 
 
 These industrial ‘plug & play’ zones will considerably reduce the start up investment costs and risks for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The other option is ‘cluster development’. A cluster is defined as a group of enterprises located within an identifiable and as far as practicable, contiguous area, producing same or similar product or services.
 
 Under the prevailing policy, only plotted development is permitted whereas under the new policy, the developer will have option to develop the colony in the shape of integrated complex comprising of industrial apartments/flatted industries with a global FAR equivalent to 1.0 of the industrial component.
 
 The entire complex will be a gated industrial colony with no internal boundary walls separating different industrial establishments.
 
 Sale/purchase of the industrial properties will be governed by the Haryana Apartment Ownership Act, 1983.
