MUMBAI: Two singers, two disciplines, two legends and two perspectives. Bandish 2020000 Hz is an evocative, nostalgic theatrical masterpiece that blends anecdotes of pathos with humour, and strings them all together through the two legends' combined love for music. The two powerhouse performers who essay   and   ­ Nivedita Bhargava and   Fatehpuria ­ rely on camaraderie on stage to carry the story forward.  , a baithak (classical) singer and Champa, a nautanki (nautch) singer relive days of their glory through witty anecdotes.

 Nivedita, who plays the classical, is a National School of Drama graduate who also comes with singing experience. “Although they come from very different musical backgrounds, when Beni and Champa meet, they do so on a very humane level. What really moved me about the character was how real the downfall from glory can be. There have been singers who reach such dizzying heights and then with the passage of time, it becomes difficult for them to get a platform to sing, the money starts to trickle in and the adulation and respect starts to dwindle. Their struggle is no longer to attain past glory, but to survive and fend for their next meal,“ she says.
 
 To bring authenticity to her part, Anubha Fatehpuria who plays Champabai is also a noted architect. Anubha says, “Champa is feisty and freespirited. Personality-wise, she is the anti-thesis to Benibai's restraint and poise. She is honest, outrageous and living in a paradox.“
