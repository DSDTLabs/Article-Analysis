PATIALA: Sikh students who staged a protest at   on Friday demanding a ban on the release of controversial movie ‘Nanak Shah Fakir’ again sat on a protest on Saturday in a peaceful way. The protest was staged near   here.

 The protesters, who carried the banners demanding a ban on the movie, alleged that Guru Nanak Dev and his family were being presented in human form in the movie, which was against the principles of Sikhism. The protesters even tried to create awareness among pilgrims visiting the local gurdwara and also warned of tearing down posters of the movie in the city.
 
 Meanwhile a delegation of protesters on Saturday met jathedar of   and urged him to get a ban imposed on the release of the movie as it was hurting Sikh sentiments. 
 
 Some Sikh scholars also want a ban on the release of the controversial movie. Prof Paramvir Singh, department of encyclopaedia of Sikhism in Punjabi University, said that, “The film depicts the founder of Sikh faith in human form. The film was produced in 2015 but was banned for hurting the Sikh sentiments. This is the second effort of the producer to re-launch his movie. Guru occupies the everlasting place in the form of bani (divine word). Sikhs are of the firm view that the lives of the ten Gurus and their family members cannot be portrayed in human form. The movie is against the principles of Sikhism and should be banned immediately.” 
 
 Former   general secretary A S Chawla though appreciated the recent move of the SGPC to seek a ban on the release of the movie again but said that sometimes incorrect decisions taken in the past could be reviewed. He said that the sentiments of the Sikh community were hurt as the basis of the Sikh faith was overlooked by presenting the Sikh Guru in human form.
