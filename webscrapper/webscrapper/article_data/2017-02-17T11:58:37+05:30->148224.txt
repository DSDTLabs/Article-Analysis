 Marikar became a fan favourite without uttering a word for most of her debut film  . However, her next venture   will have the actress delivering her fair share of dialogues.

 The young actress shared that news on her social media page announcing that she was part of the movie, directed by Pradeep M Nair. “I'm really happy and excited to announce that I'm doing a small part in the movie VIMANAM starring   (someone I loved so much and was crazy about). And.... I've completed one day of shoot. So far everything went quite well. And yeah!!! This time I have plenty of dialogues . Isn't that interesting???” she wrote.
 
 The movie has Prithviraj playing a differently-abled man who aspires to make an ultra-light aircraft all by himself. The film is being currently shot in Kochi.
