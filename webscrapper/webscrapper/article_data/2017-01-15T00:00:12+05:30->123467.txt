NAVI MUMBAI: It’s been almost a fortnight since residents reported about trees being hacked along the  , which runs through BOI and SBI  , but the civic body is yet to take any action.

 They also alleged that   officials have expressed unwillingness to initiate action against the miscreants. The locals also said that slum dwellers from Indira Nagar are making good use of the hacked trees as firewood for cooking purposes.
 
 Local residents are irked over such negligent attitude. “For the last few days, trees are being cut down systematically and no civic official is taking note of this criminal offence,” said a resident, Suman Chikhale.
 
 Even environmentalists are aghast over depletion of green cover along this belt.
 
 When TOI brought the matter to the notice of NMMC officials, Sandhya Ambade, Nerul ward officer, just said that the garden department officials have been instructed to beef up vigilance ‘to prevent further destruction of trees’.
 
 A civic team was sent by Nerul ward officer to conduct a survey of the area. They found that trees had been were hacked to almost a few inches up from the ground by MSEDCL as they were coming in the way of an overhead line. But no civic permission was sought prior to cutting these trees.
 
 Poonam Chaskar, an officer from NMMC garden department, who visited the site said, “MSEDCL staff recently hacked a few trees in the area. We were told that they were coming in the way of an overhead power line.”
 
 She added that they had chopped the trees without obtaining nay permission. 
 
 “We have warned the MSEDCL officials to compile a report of trees chopped without any prior intimation,” she added.
