BHARUCH/SURAT: The much-delayed   between Ghogha and Dahej will be ready for launch next month.

 Mansukh Mandaviya, Union minister of state for road transport, shipping and chemicals & fertilizers, told TOI on Tuesday : “I am happy to share that the ferry service will be ready by April. The dredging work is on at full swing near Dahej. People will see real benefits of sea transport as it would save a 350 km distance. It will also give a boost to entire Saurashtra economy. We are optimistic about its success.”
 
 Talking on a range of issues, including traffic snarls, Mandaviya said that the central government is planning to ban vehicles that have crossed certain age and introduce a policy to issue permit system for new vehicles in highly congested cities.
 
 “We have also planned to set up separate tracks on some roads to promote use of cycle. Most importantly, we have given emphasis on promoting transport through sea that will save money and reduce the load on roads,” he said. 
 
 Asked about the political blame game in building bridges over Narmada, the minister said, “I have also been one of the victims of traffic jam here. We gave a strict deadline for completion and I myself visited more than four times to oversee the progress.”
 
 Mandaviya also blamed the previous Congress-led UPA government for delay in the OPaL project, which resulted in the cost escalation of Rs 16,000 crore. The initial cost that was pegged at Rs 11,500 crore in 2005 has touched Rs. 27, 100 crore.
 
 “I believe that such cost overruns should not happen. The slow decision making process during previous government is responsible for the delay in the most ambitious project. Overrun is a national loss that every decision maker should keep in mind,” he said.
