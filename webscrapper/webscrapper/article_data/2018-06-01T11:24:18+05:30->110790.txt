 The farmers also staged a protest demanding the state and Centre to constitute the   Management Board without any delay. They also insisted the water to be released Cauvery water from Mettur reservoir on June 12, to facilitate delta farmers to commence kuruvai paddy cultivation on time.
 
 The State government should try to get due share of water from Karnataka before that, they added.
 
 Meanwhile, the farmers carried a Proposis Juliflora plant to grievance day meeting demanding it removal from irrigation canals and water bodies. They alleged that the number of water bodies and canals across the delta districts have filled with the plant after the Madras High Court’s direction to stop clearing the plant last year.
 
 Since the plant has been blocking water flow, everything should be removed before the release of water in Cauvery and its branch canals, they said.
