Actress   has dismissed rumours of catfights on the set of her new film  , insisting she became good friends with all of her co-stars.
 
  Hathaway stars alongside Sandra Bullock,  ,  ,  ,  , and   Carter in the 'Ocean's' franchise spin-off.
 
  
  
 She was caught up in feud reports with Blanchett in 2016. However, she said the duo had nothing but a good time on set.
 
 Hathaway said, "It's been really amazing to watch the way certain members of the media have wanted us to fight each other and the way they wanted there to be competition and catfights, but we were all collaborating - all the time." 
 
 She added, "Now, we're friends. We genuinely love each other and we're so there for each other. It's a beautiful thing. And I think that's what female friendship is. That's what it has been in my life, and I don't know why I thought it couldn't be that at work; I guess, because I was fed this myth. But we all have had an experience that disproved it."
