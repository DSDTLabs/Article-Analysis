NAVI MUMABI: Former   Tukaram Mundhe’s successor  , who took charge on Monday, plans to follow in the controversial outgoing civic chief’s footsteps. Ramaswami, a 2004 batch IAS officer, was earlier inspector general of registration and controller of stamps.

 Mundhe, who withstood political pressure to crack down on land encroachers and illegal constructions in the region, was abruptly transferred by the chief minister last week, without being assigned a post. His tenure had lasted less than a year.
 
 Commending Mundhe’s policy measures during a brief visit to the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s headquarters on Monday, Ramaswami told the media, “Whatever measures were implemented during Mundhe’s tenure will continue. Also, to know the city and its problems, I am interacting with him,” Ramaswami said. 
 
 “I have just completed the formality of taking charge and I will return to Pune to wind up my role as inspector general of registration. I am yet to learn about the city of Navi Mumbai and its issues… but whatever be the case, every decision will be as per law,” he added.
 
 Ramaswami, like Mundhe, has had ‘face-offs’ with politicians, resulting in untimely transfers.
 
 Known as a tough bureaucrat, he too had been abruptly transferred from the post of chief officer of the Mumbai Building Repairs and Reconstruction Board in 2015 after a tenure that lasted just four months. He had cracked down on contractors carrying out shoddy repair work in buildings, said sources.
 
 During his stint as inspector general of registration, he had suspended two officials in Thane for undervaluing stamp duty, leading to losses of over Rs 127 crore to the exchequer. Over his 13-year administrative service, Ramaswami, who holds a masters in veterinary science (animal husbandry), has held several prestigious posts, including assistant collector of Ratnagiri district, chief executive officer of Jalgaon, and collector of Buldhana as well as Satara.
