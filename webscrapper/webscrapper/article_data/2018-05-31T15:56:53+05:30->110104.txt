 According to the case record given by K V S V Prasad Rao, advocate for the complainant, Appanna Ratnavati, a 32-year-old housewife and resident of NAD in the city, had opened a savings account with the Marripalem Vuda Layout Post Office (account No 9739128541; old account No 960897).
 
 On July 5, 2016, when the complainant went to the post office to withdraw an amount of Rs 30,000, she was told, much to her shock and surprise, that her account balance was only Rs 1,500. She immediately lodged a report with the post office, which also conducted an enquiry into the missing amount.
 
 It was found that the complainant had misplaced her post office savings passbook and on her complaint, a duplicate passbook had been issued which showed an account balance of Rs 74,283. But when the complainant sought to withdraw part of that amount on July 5, she was told there was just Rs 1,500 in the account.
 
 The complainant also got a legal notice issued for refund of the amount but the postal authorities failed to comply with some excuse or the other. Finally, she approached the district consumer forum, which ordered the department to repay the sum of Rs 74,983 with six per cent per annum from July 7, 2016, along with a compensation of Rs 8,000 and Rs 2,500 as cost of legal fees to the complainant. 
 
 Kuppili Muralidhar, senior advocate and president, Forum of Legal Professionals, hailed the judgement and called upon the public to regularly update their post office accounts and bring to the immediate notice of authorities concerned any deficiency or discrepancies.
