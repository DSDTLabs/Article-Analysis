THANE: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) took actions against 11   after the organisers were found to be tampering with the electricity   They were charged a fine of Rs 80,020.

 The MSEDCL had received 239 applications from mandals for temporary power connections. Out of this, 238 applicants were given sanctions. A close watch was kept on all these mandals by the   squad to check if they were stealing power. The squad came across 11 such pandals that had taken illegal power extensions.
 
 “We go and visit mandals on a daily basis and keep a check on the electricity thefts. This year, we came across 11 mandals that were taking illegal power extensions from houses or societies. We had started going around from the first day of the festival itself. The team comprised of four members, a guard and an official from the area who is well versed with the locality. When we came across the thefts, we alerted the area in-charge and also intimated the organisers,” said  , assistant engineer of Damini squad.
 
 Meanwhile, the mandals claimed that they were unaware of this and that they had taken only temporary connections so tampering was out of the question.
 
 “When a resident consumes electricity, the charges increase after a particular number of units is consumed; whereas in case of temporary connections the rate remains the same at Rs.4.21 per unit, irrespective of whether 500 units is being consumed or 1,000 units. So, when one mandal takes an illegal extension they go into losses as they are not charged as per the discounted rate,” said an MSEDCL official. The 11 mandals were fined as per the units they had consumed. Also, out of Rs. 80,020 fine which was charged till now only Rs. 3,050 has been paid. It is stated that if any organiser fails to pay the fine then action will be taken against them.
