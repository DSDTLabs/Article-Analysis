CHANDIGARH: Senior advocate   on Thursday asserted before the Punjab and Haryana high court that enforcement directorate (ED) deputy director   is facing pressure ever since the name of former Punjab minister   had surfaced before the high court during the hearing of a  .

 Assertions from advocate Gupta came after the ED had asked Niranjan to change his counsel before the HC in the case. Niranjan had engaged Gupta while challenging Centre’s orders transferring him out of Punjab. When the matter came up for hearing before the HC on Thursday, Gupta submitted that in November 2017, the court had asked the special task force (STF) probing drug cases in Punjab to prepare a report on the issue after consultation with Niranjan, who had questioned Majithia in December 2014. After that the authorities started pressuring Niranjan because the state was not serious about taking action Majithia, Gupta submitted.
 
 These submissions were made by Gupta after the counsel appearing for ED submitted a letter before the court, informing it that Niranjan had written a letter to Gupta, asking him not to represent him in this case as his transfer orders had been revoked. Surprised over the development, Gupta claimed before the bench that Niranjan was threatened by senior officers with outright suspension if he did not disengage him. “The ED at the highest level was threatening and targeting lawyers. Repeated threats were extended at a time when Niranjan was mourning his father’s death,” Gupta added.
 
 On this, the counsel for ED informed the bench that Niranjan had only been advised to appear through a lawyer authorized by the department. During the hearing, the ED also submitted a status report of the case after which the court adjourned the case for May 9, asking the agency to come up with a fresh status report.
