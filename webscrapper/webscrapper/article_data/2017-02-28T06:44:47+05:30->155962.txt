AHMEDABAD: A bench headed by Chief Justice   on Monday temporarily stayed Gujarat high court from proceeding with the recruitment of system officers and assistants for lower courts across the state.

 This came in response to an appeal by 32 appellants whose petitions for regularization in their job were rejected by a single-judge bench in December 2016. The petitioners were hired in 2009 according to a decision of the Supreme Court’s ‘e-committee’ to upgrade computerization in courts. They were recruited through agencies and were told that their services would be regularized in two years.
 
 Former acting Chief Justice V M Sahai regularized their services. His successor, Justice   cancelled the decision after the high court administration quashed Justice Sahai’s orders giving jobs to various people in the high court. Last year, the high court advertised recruitment for posts of system officer and system assistant. Those who lost their jobs approached high court, challenging the HC’s decision to quash Justice Sahai’s orders to hire in regular service. A single-judge bench rejected their petitions. Aggrieved at the single-judge bench’s order, the petitioners filed an appeal before a division bench. The recruitment process has already begun. On an appeal filed through advocate  , the division bench asked the government pleader to convey to the HC administration not to proceed with the recruitment until further orders. tnn
