NOIDA: The state government has issued a list of 37   in the state that can carry out NS1 tests for confirming  , days after the administration faced allegations of downplaying the number of deaths from the disease.

 The list excludes the government-owned super-speciality child hospital, which had apparently seen over 350 dengue cases even as the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office had claimed that there were only 30 cases in the entire district.
 
 The order issued by the director general (medical and health), Padmakar Singh, on January 25 said the hospitals carrying out the MAC Eliza tests would also have to source their   from the National Institute of Virology, Pune.
 
 The district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said he had written to the listed government hospitals and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) that action would be taken against the health facilities if they do not disclose the source of their kits.
 
 Officials clarified that the order on the source of kits also applied to the super-speciality paediatric hospital and post-graduate teaching institute and the Kasna medical college — both government facilities.
 
 DMO   said that a letter had been sent in this regard to the directors of the child institute, Kasna medical college and the Indian Medical Association. The institutes and the IMA have denied having received any such letter so far.
