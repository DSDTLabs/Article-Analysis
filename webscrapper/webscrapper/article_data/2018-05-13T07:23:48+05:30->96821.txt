PUNE: The highest number of Class X students in the state show a clear preference for Commerce, according to the results of the statewide aptitude test (Kal Chachani) that were announced on Saturday.

 
  
 
 More than 2.63 lakh (21%) students showed an aptitude for the Commerce stream, followed by 2.23 lakh (18%) showing an inclination for Fine Arts. 
 
 Meanwhile, Arts has emerged as the path to tread for 1.42 lakh (11%) students, while technical field grabbed the interest of 1.23 lakh (10%). 
 
 The test, started in 2016, is conducted jointly by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), Maharashtra Academy Authority, and Shyamchi Aai Foundation. 
 
 It comprises seven fields of interests — Arts, Commerce, Technical, Health Sciences, Uniformed Services, Agriculture and Fine Arts. Students were asked 140 questions. Their aptitude is decided based on their answers. Students can download their result by entering their SSC examination seat number on ‘www.mahacareermitra.in’. 
 
 “There are many options on the website, giving specific information on various fields — number of colleges offering a particular course, courses within a discipline, etc. There are informative videos too,” said Shyamchi Aai founder-director Sheetal Bapat. 
 
 MSBSHSE chairperson Shakuntala Kale 41,607 teachers from 12,000 government and aided secondary schools were trained in guiding students. 
 
 Vishal Solanki, state commissioner of education, said the test provides a clearer understanding of where a student’s skills are. “When I cleared Class X, the popular move was to take up science, which I did. But within 10 days, I realized I didn’t have the aptitude, and moved to arts. Students at that stage need some guidance and that is what we are trying to give,” said Solanki.
