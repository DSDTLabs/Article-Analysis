HYDERABAD:  's bid to contest for the post of president in the upcoming   ( ) elections has been nipped in the bud. On Saturday, advocate commissioner returning officer K   rejected Azharuddin's candidature. The reason was lack of clarity over the lifting of the life ban imposed on the former Indian skipper by the Indian cricket board ( ) for his involvement in match-fixing related activities.

 Speaking to TOI, Rajeev Reddy said: "There are several reasons for the rejection. He had given me some high court order of 2012 but I was not satisfied whether the BCCI ban is lifted or not. I had written to the BCCI but they have not given any confirmation. Hence, I had no option but to reject. Another reason is that he is not a registered voter in the HCA. He did not come and enroll his name in time." 
 
 The BCCI, incidentally, has neither challenged the HC order nor officially lifted the ban, and Azhar was furious that he is still being haunted by the ghost of the match-fixing saga. "I can't wait forever. I have the greatest respect for the board but this is not the way to treat a former player. Post the HC order, I had written to the board on the issue but unfortunately nothing has been done about it. I want to get on with life," was his fervent plea. "It is believed that if a court order is not contested within 90 days, then the order is deemed implemented. By that count, the ban is no longer valid."
 
 The elections are to be held on January 17. "According to the Lodha reforms, I get an automatic membership in the association by virtue of being a former international player. So, the RO's claim that I am not a registered voter is not true," said Azhar.
