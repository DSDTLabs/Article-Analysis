THANE: A 30-year-old man was arrested for abetment to suicide of his 27-year-old wife, who hung herself as he allegedly demanded  . Rabiya Sayyed married   in December 2015, and they lived in  .

 “In the first week of marriage Mohammad informed Rabiya that a motorcycle was set on fire in his company, where he was a welder, due to his mistake. He claimed that he had to pay the firm a Rs 3.50 lakh fine, and he told his wife to get it from her family. He sent her to her maternal home in Mumbra to get the money.
 
 In 2016, when Mohammad was called at Rabiya’s maternal home for a function, he refused to go, stating that no one helped him pay his debt, so her family agreed to help him in future, said an officer from Mumbra police station.
 
 Rabiya was often allegedly sent to her Mumbra residence as Mohammad kept demanding money. Eventually, her family handed over Rs 60,000 and sent her to Jogeshwari. But she was sent again, as her husband demanded more, and he told her that she would not be allowed to enter the house if she did not get it.
 
 “The family claimed the husband often emotionally tortured the victim, taunting her about getting money, and Rabiya’s sister-in-law and her husband told her to listen to him and follow his instructions, added the officer. 
 
 On January 1, Rabiya had gone to Jogeshwari and returned to Mumbra at night. “The family said she looked depressed and asked her if anything was wrong but she did not respond. On January 2, she went to her sister’s residence in Mumbra in the morning, and was there alone as her sister and husband had gone to Mumbai for some work. In evening, when the couple returned, the door was locked from inside. When they broke open the door, they saw Rabiya had hung herself to an iron rod with a cloth,” the officer said. 
 
 The victim’s family registered a case against the husband at Mumbra police station.
