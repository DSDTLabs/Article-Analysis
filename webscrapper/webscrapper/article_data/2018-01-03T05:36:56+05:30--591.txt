LUDHIANA: The process of transferring some colonies from the   (Glada) to the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) will come to a halt as MC officials have now decided to consider this proposal after the civic body elections.

 The officials claimed that colonies will be taken over from Glada after getting approval from the new MC house and calculating the expenses which the civic body will have to bear when these areas will come under its jurisdiction.
 
 It was in September last year that GLADA had proposed transfer of Dugri Urban Estate phase 3 and 200 feet road, Sector 32-A, Sector 33, Sector 39 A and Sector 40 on   to the MC. According to norms, Glada was bound to transfer the colonies to MC after five years of developing the colonies.
 
 However, these colonies were developed by Glada more than five years back which is why officials wanted to hand over the maintenance work to the MC. Earlier too, the Glada had transferred some colonies ––Urban Estate phase-I and II, Dugri; Urban Estate phase-I, II and III Dhandhari; and   32, 38 and 39 on Chandigarh Road –– to the MC. At that time, the civic officials had asked Glada to first get all the repair works done before handing over the areas.
 
 Sources said the MC is in poor financial condition and this is the reason why they do not want to take the burden of these areas now. Once the colonies will be transferred to MC, the civic officials will be responsible for roads, sanitation, parks, streetlights, water supply and sewerage system in these localities.
 
 MC commissioner   said that at the moment there is no MC house. They require the nod from the house to take over these colonies, he added.
 
 He said it would add some burden on the MC exchequer, therefore they require permission from the councillors and other members of the house.
