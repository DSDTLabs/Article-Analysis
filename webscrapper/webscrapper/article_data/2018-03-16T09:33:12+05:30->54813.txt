HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) will undertake six road projects in Uppal to give people respite from bone-rattling journeys on run-down roads and nagging traffic snarls.

 The cost of projects has been estimated around Rs 55 crore, according to mayor Bonthu Rammohan. He said the municipal administration and urban development minister   will lay the foundation stone on March 18.
 
 The projects aim to ease the traffic load between Uppal and Warangal. A 3km stretch from Kushaiguda to Ghatkesar, 5km area of   heading to Cherlapally Station and another 8km stretch of this road between Chengicherla and RTC Zonal Depot will be widened at a cost of Rs 27 crore.
 
 At the same time, civic authorities have drawn up a plan to widen 7km IDA   and Uppal Stadium Road at around Rs 16.89 crore. The mayor said, “People can heave a sigh of relief as they can reach Warangal from Uppal easily by taking the Kushaiguda-Ghatkesar route.”
 
 Special repairs will be carried out on the nine km stretch of   road. GHMC estimation shows nearly Rs 11.16 crore will be spent on this project.
 
 “We have been asked to throw open these roads in the next few months. So, works will be done on warfooting to finish the projects at the earliest,” a GHMC officials said.
