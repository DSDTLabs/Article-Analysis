PATNA: The cuddle weather seems to be in a mood to tease in its last lap in Bihar. Cold north- westerly winds blowing from Himalayan region in   has caused a seesaw movement in the mercury column.

 From 34.5 degrees C on Monday, the maximum temperature plummeted to 27.8 degrees C on Friday. The minimum temperature, on the other hand, also plunged to 11.6 degrees C on Friday from over 13 degrees C recorded last week.
 
  director S Sengupta said both minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to remain a couple of notches below their respective normal for another two to three days. Sengupta attributed the slight plunge in the mercury column to high speed north-westerly winds.
 
 “Dry north-westerly winds are blowing at an average speed of 15-20kmph from past two days. The dry winds have also led to plunge in the level of relative humidity, leading to further fall in the night temperature. We expect such conditions to prevail for another two-three days, following which temperature would gradually rise,” said Sengupta.
 
 Winter normally bids adieu to the state around second week of February. In weather parlance, winter is said to have departed from Bihar when the minimum temperature remains above 13 degrees C for over four consecutive days at this time of the year.
 
 Summer conditions are expected to set in the state around the third week of March, when the maximum temperature would be recorded at 37 degrees C or above. Weathermen have hinted at severe and lengthy summer season ahead. IMD’s long range forecast based on climate models has suggested that the actual temperature in the month of March may be 0.8 degrees C higher than the normal and 1.25 degrees C above the respective normal in April across the country.
 
 Weathermen at Patna   too claimed that a comparatively warmer winter in Bihar this time would lead to faster warming of the atmosphere, translating into severe and extended summer.
