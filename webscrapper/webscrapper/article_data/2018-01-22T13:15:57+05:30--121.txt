RAIPUR: Opposition leader in   Municipal Corporation ( )   on Sunday alleged that the sanitation and health officials of the civic body are engaging in corrupt practices to bag the top spot in Swachh Survekshan 2018.

 Rathore has demanded a probe into the matter and action against the civic body officials who are covering up the matter instead of maintaining cleanliness in the city.
 
 Talking to TOI, Suryakant Rathore said, "To score points under verticals of Swachh Survekshan 2018 survey, Santosh  , who is Zone 2 in charge of  , is misleading the sanitation workers by directing them to take shortcuts. The complaint had been forwarded to Commissioner but no action has been taken so far against the health official." 
 
 Rathore added that few days back, the residents of   ward saw a sanitation worker dumping heaps of garbage from a civic body utility van at spic-and-span Ruprela street and was found clicking the photographs of the filth lying on the road. The residents of the ward enquired the sanitation worker about his act. The sanitation worker asked the residents not to interfere in civic body's work and asked them to carry on with their business. Subsequently, the residents informed Rathore in this regard, who asked the sanitation worker about the same. 
 
 Sanitation inspector   said that they had been directed by the health official Soni to take shortcuts to finish the work of cleaning the garbage collection in every ward, achieve the target of painting 'Mor Raipur' Smart City logo on walls and then update the information in the official records.
