KOLKATA: According to cops, motorist   was overspeeding in his SUV when he lost control of the car and hit the divider along the Lake Town ­Ultadanga stretch just before the   around 6.30am.

 Saha was taken to R G   with severe injuries. He was later shifted to a private hospital where he died. The Baguiati resident was driving to   for some work, said police sources.
 
 The police are investigating the exact cause of accident by subjecting the car to a technical test. The incident disrupted traffic movement on VIP Road for halfan-hour, cops said.
 
 The accident sparked anger among locals, who alleged that the civic volunteers on duty on this important stretch were only interested in stopping trucks and demanding bribes.
 
 Lax policing leads to motorists flouting rules more often than not, the residents claimed.
 
 “At times, trucks and cars take the flyover and dri ve very fast. Bikers are another menace. They race with each other,“ said Abhishek Biswas, who stays near the airport and takes the flyover every day.
 
 Senior officers, however, said they plan to build road bumps on both flanks to check accidents on this stretch.
