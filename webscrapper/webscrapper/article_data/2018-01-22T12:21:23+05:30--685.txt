SURAT: A 46-year-old man was arrested from the limits of   area for harassing a 42-year-old woman on Saturday. The accused thrashed the woman’s husband when he asked him not to harass his wife whom he had been threatening and harassing for the last 15 days.

 Bhupendra  , a colour work contractor, was arrested by police for allegedly harassing a woman living in the neighbourhood. Sahni, a resident of Pal locality of Adajan, had held her hand when she was standing on the ground floor of her building on January 5. When the woman tried to break free, the accused started to pull her towards him.
 
 The complainant threatened to shout for help and the accused let her go but after warning her of dire consequences if she complained to anyone. The woman initially did not inform family members about the harassment. However, the accused entered the house of the complainant on Friday when no one was present and demanded sexual favours from her. The woman informed her husband about this and he approached the accused asking him not to harass his wife. This enraged the accused who attacked the woman’s husband for daring to warn him. 
 
 “We have arrested the accused on the woman’s complaint against him. Both the families know each other. Our investigation will also find out if the accused had harassed any other woman before this,” police said.
