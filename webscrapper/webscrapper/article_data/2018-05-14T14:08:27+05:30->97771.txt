SURAT: The Federation of Gujarat Weavers Association ( ) has called an urgent meeting of its members to deal with recession in the textile sector. The meeting will be held at Varachha on Monday. 

 Fogwa president   told TOI, “We need to discuss how many hours should the weavers run their units in the present situation. Should they run their units for 16 hours or 12 hours each day? The government has set up anti-profiteering screening committee to look into rising price of yarn but it has been of no help to us so far.” 
 
 The association has also raised the issue of input credit to the industry from the time GST was implemented. Weavers are miffed that majority of other industries are being given input credit but not the textile industry. 
 
 It also demanded restoration of 30% technology upgradation amount. The government has reduced it to 10%. Fogwa says that if the Indian industry has to survive the competition, then it needs 30% subsidy for technology upgradation. Weavers also want scrapping of taxes on job work.
