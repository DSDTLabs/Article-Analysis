MUMBAI: Police inspector   (58) from Madhya Pradesh, a victim of fat-shaming on Twitter, arrived in the city on Sunday to undergo treatment for obesity.

 Netizens slammed her for “fatshaming“ Jogawat, who is set to retire in 2019. He has won over 200 awards, his superiors said.
 
 Neemuch district superintendent of police Manoj Singh said, “The MP police was planning to take care of his treatment, but we were swarmed by offers from hospitals across the country . We got offers from VLCC, a clinic in Indore and bariatric surgeon Dr Mufazzal Lakdawala, among several others.“
 
 Earlier, Jogawat had said, “I became fat when my gall bladder was removed in 1993. She (Shobhaa De) posted my picture on her account but will she pay for my treatment“. Sources said he was also suffering from an insulin-related disorder.
