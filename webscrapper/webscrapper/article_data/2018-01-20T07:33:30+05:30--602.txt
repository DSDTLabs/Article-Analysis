VIJAYAWADA: The   chief minister, N Chandrababu   on Friday objected to remarks made by his   counterpart   on AP's development. 

 Addressing the district collector's conference here, Naidu said he felt pained over  's comments that there is no comparison between AP and Telangana as far as development is concerned. "AP is a low income state, and it is not the mistake of its people, it is the mistake of those who bifurcated the state. I am not blaming the TRS or anyone," Naidu said. Naidu said the Andhraites are capable, but the bifurcation has affected them. "I am not talking about one state or the other. AP is behind in per capita income and in the service sector among all other southern states. This happened due to bifurcation, and that is why I have been repeatedly asking   to do justice to us till there is a level playing field between all the states," he added.
 
 When senior bureaucrat LV Subrmanyam reminded him about KCR's remarks that Andhra rulers destroyed Telangana, the CM shot back, "Hyderabad was the common capital of the two states, everyone worked for its development. All of us, including you (IAS officers), contributed for the development of the city. We are starting from scratch now." Stating that the Centre has to support AP by all means, he said his government will not hesitate to approach the   for justice if required. 
 
 Later, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesperson Dasoju Sravan on Friday described the claims made by K   on the growth of Telangana as a bundle of lies.
