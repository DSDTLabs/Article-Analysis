HYDERABAD: In what appears to be growing confrontation between the TRS and the   ahead of next year's elections, the saffron party on Tuesday took to the streets to protest chief minister  's criticism of Prime Minister   at a public meeting in Karimnagar. 

 The protests were confined to Hyderabad, but the party threatened to spread it to the districts unless   apologises.
 
 The BJP leaders burned the effigy of KCR at   X Roads. They also called on the governor to lodge a complaint. In their representation, they accused KCR of using abusive language against Modi. "During his last speech in Karimnagar, he used Telugu words such as "vaadu", "veedu", "gaadu", which are highly objectionable and condemnable," the BJP leaders said. They said KCR has been continuously and constantly abusing the PM.
