GURGAON: Excitement was high among commuters of   on Monday, the first working day of the week since the launch of the second phase last Friday afternoon.

 The full-fledged commercial operations of the second phase of Rapid Metro, India’s first mass transit system that is privately built and operated, began at 6.05 am for the 7km journey from Sector 55/56, the terminal station, to Sikanderpur.
 
 Commuters, mostly office goers, thronged the new stations amid a lot of fanfare. The authorities, however, did not give out the number of passengers who rode Rapid Metro on Monday. “We will get to know about the ridership once the operations are over for the day. We will also the know the number of trips at the end of day,” said a spokesperson for Rapid Metro.
 
 “I work at   and routinely had to take an Uber or an auto to   station. I will save money and time with this. Besides, the infrastructure is very good,” said Sandeep, an officer goer.
 
 “But one thing that Rapid Metro authorities can do is improve the first and last-mile connectivity. There are wide roads, but no footpath. There is nothing to walk on after we leave the station. There are a lot of things to do; better walking areas, better cycling areas,” he added.
 
 Other commuters also shared similar feedback, especially about saving time.
 
 “The Metro seems to be moving faster than the ones that move on the first phase’s route,” said Vineeta Singh, another commuter. “The ACs are also working better. It’s much cooler during summers. The main benefit is that I am now saving plenty of time. It took me more than half an hour to reach Cyber City by a cab from Golf Course Road. Now, that time is reduced to just 10 to 15 minutes,” she said.
 
 Sanjay, a student who took the   55–56 station and got off at Phase 1, said, “Normally for this travel, I pay Rs 10 in a shared auto. The Metro travel required twice as much but it is worth it .”
