NEW DELHI: A day after the Delhi government’s anti-corruption branch   AAP’s Krishna Nagar MLA S K   for  , the party claimed ACB had acted on a three-year-old   that had been   by the complainant in  . 

 “It is beyond any reasonable understanding that the defunct ACB, which has failed in taking any action against genuine complaints of corruption by residents of Delhi, is targeting the elected representatives of AAP on frivolous grounds merely by taking orders from BJP’s political bosses,” AAP said in a statement.
 
 The party further alleged that the ACB lodged the FIR against Bagga on the basis of a complaint given to it in August 2015, which the complainant subsequently withdrew in November that year. “The complainant himself had given in writing to the investigating officer that he had filed the complaint due to some personal grudge...and three months later he withdrew all the allegations against him in the presence of at least 10 witnesses,” the AAP statement read. 
 
 The ruling party in Delhi warned that it would not remain a mute spectator to “harassment of AAP MLAs by Delhi Police and other wings of the BJP’s central government”. AAP is planing to take legal recourse.
 
 Bagga was booked under Prevention of Corruption Act after he had allegedly demanded Rs 2 lakh from bhajan singer Rajesh Sachdeva, promising the latter a ticket for the the 2017 municipal elections. 
 
 Sachdeva had recorded his conversations with the MLA and his associates, and presented them to the ACB. When TOI contacted Bagga on Friday, he denied the charges.
