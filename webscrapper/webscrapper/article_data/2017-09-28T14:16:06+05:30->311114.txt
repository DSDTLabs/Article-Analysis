PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa will deliver its order on Wednesday on a   plea seeking disqualification of health minister Vishwajit Rane for resigning as MLA to join  .

 The court listed the case for passing the order after Congress on Wednesday informed that it did not want to file a petition before the speaker. During the hearing on Tuesday, the high court had indicated that the petitioner had the option of approaching the speaker seeking Rane’s disqualification.
 
 The petitioner’s contention was that the speaker had no jurisdiction to decide on the case. Congress alleged that Rane resigned as Valpoi MLA to avert the filing of a   against him before the speaker.
 
 Rane’s counsel raised the issue of jurisdiction of the high court to entertain the disqualification plea as disqualification can be decided by the speaker. Congress says Rane stood disqualified as a whip was issued to him to vote against the government's confidence motion-led by CM Manohar Parrikar.
