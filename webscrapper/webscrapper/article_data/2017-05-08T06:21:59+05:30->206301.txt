 HC directed the authorities to hold a meeting and prepare a plan for decongesting the road taken by commuters for going to Gurgaon and   airport.
 
 "Having regard to the density of the built up structure and the population as well as the congestion of the vehicular traffic leading to the airport,   and other local authorities would have also to consider the convenience of the local public at the stage of construction of the bypass if undertaken," the bench said.
 
 The court passed the directions while disposing of a petition by the residents welfare associations of Vasant Vihar challenging PWD's decision to build a three-lane flyover parallel to the single-lane flyover on RTR Marg.
