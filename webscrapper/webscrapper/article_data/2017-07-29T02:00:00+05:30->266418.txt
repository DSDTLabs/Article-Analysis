PATNA: The   and JD (U) are likely to share equal number of ministerial posts in the newly formed   government with   at the helm.

 After a vitriol-filled debate during Friday’s floor test, which the NDA won comfortably, all eyes are now on distribution of ministerial berths among the coalition partners. While BJP’s list of ministers would be finalised by its central leadership, many ministers from JD (U) in the Grand Alliance government are keeping their fingers crossed.
 
 Union minister  , who had come to Patna to participate in the oath-taking ceremony at Raj Bhavan, had reportedly held a meeting with senior office-bearers of BJP’s state unit to shortlist names of probable ministers from NDA. The BJP’s central leadership will take a final call on the shortlisted names. As of now, 14 ministers each from JD (U) and BJP are likely to be included in the cabinet. Former CM and HAM-S chief Jitan Ram Manjhi has ruled out his inclusion in the cabinet of ministers.
 
 “I have no desire to be a minister in the new government. Besides, I am the lone   from my party. My party will only be part of the new government and not the cabinet,” Manjhi said. Ram Vilas Paswan-led LJP and Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP may also secure at least one berth each in the new cabinet.
 
 A senior JD (U) functionary said few of the probable ministers from party quota include former water resources department minister Rajeev Ranjan Singh alias  , former energy department minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav and former parliamentary affairs minister Shravan Kumar.
 
 In the saffron camp, names of former urban development minister Prem Kumar, former road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav, former BJP state president Mangal Pandey and Gyanendra Singh “Gyanu” are doing the rounds.
