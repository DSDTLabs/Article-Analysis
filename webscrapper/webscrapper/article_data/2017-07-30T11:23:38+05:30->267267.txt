CHANDIGARH: Panjab University is soon going to start an academic audit of various courses offered by its teaching departments. This was decided in a meeting recently held at   here.

 PU vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover designated the task of carrying out the audit to Prof Akshay Kumar. Also, Grover directed the universityâ€™s internal quality assurance cell ( ) to query departments to identify changes they have made in their syllabus between 2014 and 2017.
 
 The decision came after deliberations that the syllabi of many courses are not updated. Sources said Prof Akshay Kumar raised the issue in the meeting. He suggested a periodic review of all syllabi to keep updated with what requirements of society and industry. However, IQAC director M Rajivlochan said IQAC had already asked departments to review their syllabi in consultation with alumni, students, and potential employers, said sources. Prof Archana Bhatnagar pointed out that despite the IQAC asking the departments to give feedback on the review of all courses in March 2017, none responded.
 
 Prof   suggested an academic audit of all courses offered by the university and colleges affiliated to it. Sources said dean of university instructions Prof Meenakshi Malhotra shared her experience of conducting a regular academic review of courses at   through an advisory board at the department, which included alumni among other members.
 
 Discussing choice-based credit system (CBCS), Prof Akshay said since implementation of CBCS had been delayed, the syllabus for entire CBCS, rather than just for a few semesters, should be chalked out.
