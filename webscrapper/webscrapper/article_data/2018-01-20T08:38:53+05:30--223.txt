PUNE: Soon, an intensive care unit ( ) will come up at the Sardar Vallabhbai Patel Cantonment   (SVPCGH) in Pune Cantonment.

 A decision in this regard was taken in Pune Cantonment Board’s ( ) general body meeting on Wednesday.
 
 Chief executive officer (CEO) DN Yadav told TOI on Friday, “Due to the lack of an ICU at the hospital, we are compelled to transfer critical patients to private hospitals. All board members have given their consent for setting up an ICU at the facility.”
 
 Currently, the outpatient department ( ) handles over 600 patients on a daily basis. The move will strengthen cantonment hospital’s services and ensure better health care to residents, an official from the board said.
 
 “Our endeavour is to provide bsetter facilities to camp residents. We are chalking out a plan to rope in expert doctors to run the facility in future,” Yadav said.
 
 The PCB authorities have already approached local politicians to arrange funds for the ICU. “As per our estimate, Rs 2 crore will be required to set up the unit,” officials said, adding that, it was suggested in the meeting that the equipment be procured using   and MP funds.
 
 For the first time, the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) has stepped in by providing three doctors for OPD. “The board will have a detailed discussion with the AFMC authorities about running the ICU at the hospital. We will seek help from their experts doctors for the same,” another board official told TOI.
 
 Board member Kiran Mantri, who has been following the issue for last few years, told TOI, “It is the need of the hour to have an ICU at the hospital as a large number of people can’t afford medical care in private hospitals. I have requested the board to set up multi-diagnosis facilities.”
