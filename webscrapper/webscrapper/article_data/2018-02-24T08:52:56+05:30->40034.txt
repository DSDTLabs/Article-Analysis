MANSA: While accusing the   government of discriminating against Malwa region, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal said not only sanctions to start work at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bathinda were being delayed, but construction of irrigation channels had also been stopped.

 Addressing a rally at Jhunir in Mansa on Friday along with his wife and Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Sukhbir said the AIIMS project in Bathinda had been delayed because the Congress government did not give the requisite no objection certificates (NOCs). “It was the dream project of previous SAD-BJP government. But the Congress does not seem keen on providing top healthcare facilities to people afflicted with cancer. Similarly, most of the work on construction of irrigation channels worth about Rs 800 crore had been completed during SAD-BJP tenure, but the remaining work has now been stopped,” he added.
 
 Trade and commerce have been affected in the Bathinda parliamentary constituency due to the enforcement of ‘goonda tax’ in the name of ‘Jojo service tax (JST).’ No action has been taken against those enforcing this illegal tax despite a direct order from the chief minister, Sukhbir said. 
 
 Harsimrat said the Congress government had told the NITI Aayog that it might not procure wheat from farmers if it was not given Rs 1,000 crore immediately. Stating that the government was befooling people by stating that its treasury was empty, she said the government should tell where the money collected in the form of taxes from excise, GST, power cess and registration charges had gone. 
 
 Harsimrat said she had held a successful meeting with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday and requested him to link Toronto and Amritsar with an Air Canada flight. 
 
 Local Akali leader and Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Singh Bhunder said Congress leaders were harassing Akali workers and this would not be tolerated.
