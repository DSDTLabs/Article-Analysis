Mapusa: The Mapusa Municipal Council ( ) will soon begin issuing trade licences, income certificates, and water connection online. 

 The MMC has invited an expression of interest seeking services of a reputed firm to develop and manage software systems. This will include online workflow systems for application and renewal of trade licences, issuing income certificates, power and water connection, file-tracking, and an SMS-based system for application tracking and maintenance of the council’s official website.
 
 The MMC has decided to implement the Goa Right of Citizen for Time Bound Services Act so as to provide better services to the people with the help of information technology. The town’s civic body has also initiated works to make the administration paperless. This largely involves digitisation of all documents. 
 
 Sources said the MMC already offers some of its services online, such as payment of property tax, house tax and rent. The project is aimed at creating a single-window system and transparency in the working of the municipality and is expected to benefit citizens. People can download forms from the website for trade licences and income certificates.
