Ahmedabad: A 16-year-old   Shivkesh Gurjar was crushed by a reversing   near Gajra chawl in Odhav on Thursday morning. 

 
 Strangely, local people alleged that it was a case of murder by the truck driver Dwarkesh Yadav. They said Yadav had deliberately crushed the boy because the latter had quarrelled with Yadav on Wednesday night. Odhav police immediately arrived and even thought of charging the truck driver with murder. But later in the afternoon, the case was transferred to traffic police station and a case of causing death in a road accident was registered against Yadav.
 
 Sources said Shivkesh’s father, Jivraj Gurjar, lives at Gajra chawl in Odhav and drives an auto to earn his living. His eldest son lives in Rajasthan and the two younger daughters had been married off. Jivraj himself hails from Rajasthan.
 
 “Shivkesh used to live with his father and mother. He had appeared in the recently concluded class 10 board exams,” a source said. 
 
 Local sources alleged that Shivkesh had a quarrel with the truck driver on Wednesday night about parking. The truck driver had allegedly threatened Shivkesh.
 
 “After that Shivkesh and his two friends had gone to sleep on a cot just behind the truck,” a source said. “In the morning, Yadav while reversing his truck, ran over Shivkesh while his two friends just managed to save their lives. Local people caught Yadav and handed him over to the police.” 
 
 Odhav police said that after verifying allegations, they had come to the conclusion that the accident was not intentional. “Hence, we handed over the case to the traffic police for further investigation,” an Odhav police official said.
