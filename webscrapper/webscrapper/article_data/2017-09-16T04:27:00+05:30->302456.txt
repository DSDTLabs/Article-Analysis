Ahmedabad: From a healthy 80kg, Nehal Dhajaniya (30) had become all bones, weighing merely 30kg, as she could not even swallow a few gulps of water, leave alone eat a meal. In three years, she changed multiple doctors, took alternative medicine, and had given up on life till she was finally diagnosed with achalasia and endoscopically treated.

 Achalasia is a rare, highly morbid disease of the oesophagus that makes it difficult for food and liquid to pass into the stomach due to the failure of muscle fibres to relax, causing the sphincter to remain closed. As medication is of little help, surgery is the only option.
 
 “A two-day workshop, ‘POEM 2017’, is being organized here to train gastro-doctors in advanced surgery named Preroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) to treat this rare but highly morbid condition which completely destroys the quality of life of patients,” said Dr Nilay Mehta, the organizing secretary of POEM 2017. Dr Sudhanshu Patwari, the organizing chairman, said that 10 top faculty including Dr Amol Bapaye from Pune, Dr Mohan Ramchandani from Hyderabad, and Dr Pankaj Desai, Surat, will train the doctors.
 
 “Over 100 gastro-physicians and surgeons will be trained in the challenging surgery which helps release pressure from the gastro-oesophageal junction, allowing patients to regain normalcy in eating and drinking,” Dr Mehta said.
