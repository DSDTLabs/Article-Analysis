BENGALURU: While the nation is still reeling under the effect of demonetisation, the   (MEA) is yet to issue an advisory on the issue to nonresident Indians (NRI) travelling to Bengaluru for the  .

 As many as 1,300 to 1,500 NRI delegates have confirmed participation in the event scheduled between January 7 and 9. While the Karnataka government will be hosting the event, it has put the ball in MEA's court to ensure that the NRIs are not affected by demonetisation.
 
 Karnataka minister for large and medium scale industries   said, “We had a preliminary round of discussions with the MEA and asked them to put out advisories on demonetization for those attending Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. Delegates should not land in Bengaluru to be hit by demonetization.“
 
 Last month, members of the   (GOPIO) in Washington told PTI that delegates attending Pravasi Bharatiya Divas were likely face a cash crunch without new notes in their pockets. “One group that will be hit hard by the government's restrictions will be hundreds of delegates reaching Bengaluru for the Pravasi convention from all over the world,“ said Sunny Kulathakal of Global Organization of People of Indian Origin (GOPIO).
 
 Kulathkal said many NRIs hold demonetized currency notes, which they may find difficult to exchange. He said GOPIO will request the government to facilitate the exchange of these notes at various Indian embassies. Deshpande has asked the MEA to explain the process for exchange of old notes for the benefit of the delegates. “On January 5, at the meeting, we will once again put forth our request to ensure that the demonetization advisory is provided to all delegates before they land in Bengaluru for the event,“ said Deshpande.
 
 GOPIO said it will also seek the Centre's assistance for adequate support to convert old notes in possession of the delegates at the January 5 meeting.
