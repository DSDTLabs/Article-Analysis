NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday dubbed Lt Governor  's address on opening day of budget session in Delhi assembly as "disappointing and hollow", reflecting the AAP government's two years performance. 

 The leader of the opposition in assembly,  , said the address had "nothing new" for the AAP government which was "dreaming" to make Delhi look like London.
 
 "The Kejriwal government has disastrously failed to present its vision for Delhi's future through the address of governor. It is only the summary of contents of recent publicity campaign by the government.
 
 Gupta said it was beyond understanding how the government will make Delhi look like London in one year if it has no policy frame work for it.
