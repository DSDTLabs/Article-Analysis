BENGALURU: India should establish its supremacy by transferring   to other countries through the   and not by force - this was the message conveyed by  .

 Girmitiya countries are home to descendants of indentured  , who were taken there by the British to work in sugarcane plantations two centuries ago. They include Mauritius, Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname.
 
 Delivering the keynote address at the Youth Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, Suriname vice-president Michael Ashwin Adhin said: “The transformation of India implies an 'influential India' at the global level. But the question is: Why do I need an influential India?“ Emphasizing greater economic and technological cooperation between India and Suriname, he said: “Today, nearly 20% of Suriname's population comprises east Indians (referred to as Hindustanis). They started as labourers brought to Suriname from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar between 1873 and 1916. These people did not forget the cultural values they had brought with them from India. Now Suriname Indians have acquired key positions in the government.“ Appealing to India to play the role of a big brother, Adhin said: “Monopoly in business should be reduced and the rise of new nations should be encouraged to ensure balance of power. Technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics should be used to reduce the cost of living. India should emerge as superpower not only because it has potential but also because it has spirituality and values that define a vishwa guru (world leader). There should be mutual benefits for both the nations.“
 
 Stating that Suriname has rich deposits of   and bauxite along with a vast forest cover, Adhin said, “We are a green and a blue economy .With technology from India, we can also compete.“
