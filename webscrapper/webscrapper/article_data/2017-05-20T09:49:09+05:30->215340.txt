BHUBANESWAR:   in   has got the much-needed very high frequency (VHF) towers to activate   in   to check poaching. 

 Earlier the villagers were unwilling to let the towers come up citing that their basic requirement of road connectivity and livelihood were being neglected. 
 
 Baisipali, which recently came under Maoist influence, has thrown a tough challenge for the authorities to ensure protection of wildlife. It is home to 70 resident elephants and several varieties of herbivores and carnivores.
 
 Divisional forest officer (Mahanadi division) Anshu Pragyan Das said after repairing the forest road to connect 20 villages and power supply to 15 villages under the Forest Rights Act, the villagers gave their consent to setting up the VHF towers. 
 
 "Besides road and power supply, we ensured solar street lights in the villages having no power supply. These were done from the fund allotted by  , said Das. 
 
 "We have already set up two VHF towers and construction of other two is under way. As many as five anti-poaching camps have been established," she added. The camps are located at Buriapaju, Senpari, Tikilajhari, Duisingh and Bankajhari. 
 
 To involve the villagers in conservation initiative, power tillers have been provided in six villages and 120 families have been given torch lights. "To divert the women from mahua flower collection in the forest for livelihood, we have formed self-help groups in 20 villages and provided 35 sewing machines," said a senior forest officer.
 
 The authorities have also planned to supply energy efficient cooking chullah to 400 households to check the villagers' dependence on forests. 
 
 The chullah is made of mud bricks and soil. Nearly two-third families in rural pockets in the sanctuary depend solely on firewood.
