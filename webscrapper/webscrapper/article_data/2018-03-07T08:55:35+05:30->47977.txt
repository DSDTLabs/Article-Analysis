Thousands of women from the city will come together and join hands at the Reliance Stadium to create a record of ‘world’s largest chain of women joining hands’. 

 “The Indian women’s team performed well in the world cup last year and their popularity has gone up. Now cricket buffs in every home know these women cricketers by their names. And now they are going to play in the city. So, we thought of sending across the message of women empowerment,” said Snehal Parikh, BCA secretary (in-charge). 
 
 “We want to draw in maximum crowd to see the ODI matches and encourage the women cricketers. We have roped in a team that has helped in organizing the Vadodara Marathon. They will help us in creating the world record and also drawing the spectators to the stands,” Parikh told TOI. The women will hold each other’s hand and stand around the ground to create the world record. 
 
 “The three ODIs that India will play against Australia will be about women empowerment. We want more girls to get inspired and join the sport,” he added. India will play three ODIs against Australia on March 12, March 15 and March 18. The BCA has also planned some other activities for the spectators who will turn up to watch the matches.
