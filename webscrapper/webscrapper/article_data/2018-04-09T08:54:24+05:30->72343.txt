BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s pre-poll generosity continues. On Sunday, he raised retirement age for 1.6 lakh   and sahayikas to 62 years, and doubled their honorarium.

 Aanganwadi workers will now get Rs 10,000 a month (up from Rs 5,000) and sahayikas will get Rs 5,000 (up from Rs 2,500). They will also get travelling allowance. This will put more pressure on the state’s depleted coffers. On March 30, the CM had increased retirement age for employees of state government and corporations to 62. 
 
 On Sunday, the CM attended a workshop on nutrition campaign, organized for aanganwadi workers and sahayikas at his residence. He urged them to ensure best management of aanganwadis and “work hard to free   of malnutrition”. 
 
 No aanganwadi worker or sahayika would be removed without investigation, he assured, adding that if an aanganwadi sahayika applies for aanganwadi worker’s post, she would get preference.
 
 Chouhan also announced the Deendayal Poshan Award of Rs 1 lakh for aanganwadi workers and Rs 75,000 for sahayikas after retirement. In case of sudden death, their families will be provided financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh, and their daughter or sister would be given preference of 10 marks during selection as worker or sahayika.
 
 Women labourers in unorganized sector would be given Rs 4,000 during pregnancy and Rs 12,000 post-delivery, he reiterated. Aanganwadi workers will be responsible for getting these women registered and the money deposited in their account.
 
 Chouhan said aanganwadi workers and sahayikas would be given three awards for performance — cash prizes of Rs 7,100, Rs 5,100 and Rs 2,100. For sahayikas, prizes will be worth Rs 5,100, Rs 2,100 and Rs 1,100.
