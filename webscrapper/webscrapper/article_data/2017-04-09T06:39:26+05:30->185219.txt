HYDERABAD: Goods &   (GST), which is set to become a reality from July this year, will make domestic products much cheaper than even imports in many cases, minister of state for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman said here on Saturday.

 Sitharaman told an interactive session of the   (YFLO), in which nearly 200 members of   and   participated along with their spouses, that currently domestic goods or commodities become unbelievably expensive by the time they reach the customer due to multiple taxation.
 
 “All of us in the south know...that wheat produced in UP and Punjab is more expensive here than what comes from Australia to Chennai or Kochi because of the layers of taxes paid at toll gates,“ she said.
 
 Pooh-poohing the perception that a watered down version of GST had been passed, she said that the current multiple taxation bands would eventually come down to around one or two.
 
 On a query about concerns of employers that the government decision to hike paid maternity leave benefit from 12 weeks to 26 weeks would be counter-productive, Sitharaman rooted for emphasis on skills rather than looking at a woman as somebody who has a more welfare seeking mindset. “I think the mindset in India should change because even now there is a clear absence of women in the workforce. I think its important when you know that the skillset you need in an employee is available in a woman.“
