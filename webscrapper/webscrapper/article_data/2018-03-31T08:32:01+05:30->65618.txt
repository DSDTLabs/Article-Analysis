ABOHAR: Police have   10 men for allegedly parading a youth in a village here on March 23, after blackening his face and putting a garland of shoes around his neck. 

 The police registered the case on Saturday, under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 365 (abduction) and 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 61-A of the Information Technology Act. The action came after a video of the incident went viral on social media, even though a woman had lodged a complaint over the incident on the day it took place.
 
 While five accused have been identified as Abohar natives Kattu Ram, Sunil Kumar, Bholi, Veera, and Sham Sunder, the other five are yet to be identified. No arrests have been made yet.
 
 The complainant, a married woman, had alleged that her husband was a drunkard and she was subjected to physical torture by him. Meanwhile, she befriended a youth who was residing next to her house in the village. “On March 23, when I visited my parents’ home, the youth followed me there and he was held captive by the accused there. Later, they blackened his face and garlanded him with shoes, and forced him to walk through the streets of the village,” she said.
 
 The police claimed that investigations were on, but the accused were at large at present.
