NEW DELHI: The   government is willing to give 33% reservation to women in   and state assemblies.

 However, it is in favour of building a consensus among all parties before a bill is introduced, minister of state for law PP Chaudhary said on Friday.
 
 The minister was responding to a written question in   where the members wanted to know if the government was in favour of giving reservations to women in state assemblies and Parliament and why it had failed to introduce a bill during the last three years.
 
 Chaudhary, however, said the issue needs careful consideration on the basis of the consensus among all political parties before a bill for amendment in the Constitution is brought before Parliament.
 
 During the debate on triple talaq in   in the last winter session, the main opposition   had raised the issue and asked the government why it has not introduced the women reservation bill if it wanted to empower women.
