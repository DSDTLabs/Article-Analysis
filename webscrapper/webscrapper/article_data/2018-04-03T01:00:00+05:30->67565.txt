It’s not every day that a   superstar is asked to clean a hotel room.  , dressed as a hotel management student, shooting for Shoojit Sircar’s upcoming film ' ', had to do exactly that to add realism to his performance.

 The film was being shot at a plush five-star hotel in   and Varun was dressed exactly like one of the hotel’s staff. Shoojit wanted to shoot his film in the most authentic way, so Varun was asked to run the errands of a hotel staffer. He was doing everything from washing toilets, cleaning dishes, vacuuming, cooking, etc. The idea was to have Varun pick up the body language and behaviour for his character. The foreign guests in the hotel, who weren’t aware that Varun was a Bollywood star, mistook him for a staffer and requested him to clean the room and fetch their food. 
 
 Varun was so obsessed with staying in character that he didn’t mind doing any chore that helped him get into the part. Interestingly, Shoojit made good with the opportunity and shot the actor completing his hotel tasks, for the film.
