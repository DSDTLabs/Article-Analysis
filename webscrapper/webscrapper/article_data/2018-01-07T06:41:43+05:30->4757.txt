KOLKATA: The state is finally reaping benefits of the ‘Safe Drive Save Life’ campaign. While overall accidents decreased by 14% in 2017 compared to 2016, fatalities came down by 15%.

 Police received its biggest success in December — usually considered to be one of the most accident-prone months due to the fog in rural Bengal. According to ADG (traffic) Vivek Sahai, a five-pronged strategy implemented on state and national highways in the month of December helped cops decrease both accidents and fatalities by 18% in December 2017 compared to the same month in 2016.
 
 According to data available with Bengal traffic cops, the state recorded a total 921 accidents and 463 deaths in December 2017. In December 2016, a total of 1110 accidents were reported in the state with 562 casualties.
 
 Sahai said simple steps adopted by police worked wonders. “We set up special nakas on highways to check over-speeding. But most importantly, we managed to dissuade motorists from driving around in fog. Instead, our men offered them water and tea to drink. We also ensured that breath analysers were handed out in large numbers so that the police can check drink driving.”
 
 The maximum success has been achieved in Hooghly, Nadia, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas. While Hooghly and North 24 Parganas work through smaller commissionerates, South 24 Parganas has been broken in to multiple police districts. Sources at Bhawani Bhawan said one of the reasons behind the success was the accurate pinpointing of the accident-prone zones. “We covered all important points and took our awareness drive to the highways,” said an officer.
 
 The chief minister herself recently mentioned about how the special drive was reaping benefits.
