 

 Mumbai-based performance poet Rochelle D’silva will be launching her six-poem album in the city this evening. This EP is an amalgamation of poetry and music. Melbourne-based musician Meena Shamaly has given   to the poet’s words in this unique collaboration.
 
 Called 
 , this album is very personal yet universal, says Rochelle. “The poems are about something that all of us feel – love, loss, letting go. I wanted to see what I can do next with my art. On some occasions when my poetry was accompanied by music, I realised it sort of elevates the spoken word,” shares the poet about the idea behind this EP. She says it is probably a first of its kind in India. “I am blessed to have wonderful musicians as friends. So the collaboration was very improv and we just went with the flow,” she adds.
 
 The EP launch has already taken place in Melbourne, Mumbai and Pune. Ask her about her connection with the city and with a distinct cheerfulness she says, “I have been bragging about Ahmedabad – the warmth and love that people here have given me is amazing. And the food is awesome!” Rochelle has visited the city earlier to perform and even conduct workshops. What’s next in line? “Well, I want to take the EP to a few more cities. And I have been wanting to work on a book so I will probably take a month or so off to do that,” she signing off.
 
 Rochelle D’silva's album launch can be attended on April 2, 6:30 pm at Working Company, Mithakali Six Roads, Ellis Bridge
