Panaji: Reshuffling their top ranks, executive members of the Goa Forward Party on Wednesday unanimously elected Vijai Sardesai as the party president. Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar has been given the responsibility of the youth members while Siolim MLA Vinod Palyekar has been given the responsibility to reach out to the backward communities in the state.  Speaking after the meeting, Sardesai, who took over from Renuka D’Silva said that the honeymoon period for the government is over.  “We did a positive compromise with our coalition partners to form the government but now we have to perform as well. To further take forward our agenda, the party also has to grow. I have taken over as president to augment the growth of the party,” Sardesai said, adding that his party would have contested more seats had they not hoped for a grand alliance of opposition parties.  Sardesai openly invited former Congress spokesperson Trajano D’Mello to join GFP. “D’Mello shared the same sentiments and pointed out the match-fixing. He was kicked out of the Congress but he should join us,” he said. This is the second time that the GFP has made a public call to Tranjano to join the party. While revealing his plans to increase the party’s presence in the state, Sardesai traded barbs at Congress as well, claiming that they benefitted from Goa Forward’s decision to contest on only four seats.  “We thought of opposition unification but it did not happen. Congress benefited from our narrative, cheated us before elections and wanted to do the same afterwards. We will spread our party in a way where there is no conflict with our alliance partners. There are enough constituencies where we can do that,” he said.
