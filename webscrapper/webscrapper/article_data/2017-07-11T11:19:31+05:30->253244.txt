AHMEDABAD: More than 100 trees that stood the danger of being hacked to make way for the multi-crore Metrorail project will be transplanted to safer locations.   for   (MEGA) will take care of these trees. On Monday, a tree transplanting vehicle moved along the railway line near Navajivan Publications to shift the trees that fell on the route of elevated corridor to a safer location. 

 The initial tenders that were floated by MEGA had mentioned cutting of trees but the decision was reversed by MEGA managing director I P Gautam who then sought   (AMC) tree transplanting machines to shift these trees.
 
 “By conservative estimates, there is a 70% survival rate of trees that have been transplanted, and 90% if the process is carried out well,” says Gautam. “We had tested transplanting a few trees, close to 7 to 8 of them, two days ago, before going ahead for more than 100 trees.” He added that more than 700 trees were transplanted during BRTS corridor construction and many of them had survived. 
 
 During transplantation, usually a trench is dug around a full-grown tree’s base, which is 850mm girth or above. The tree is then pulled out with a crane. Root ball is covered the with a wet husk or resin cloth and the tree is shifted to a new location on a flatbed trailer. First, a part of the tree’s root system is dug out from one side of the tree. “The trees will be looked after by MEGA for a year,” said a senior MEGA official. 
 
 Botanists or tree plantation experts first apply medicines to exposed roots so that the tree doesn’t catch infection. After 10 to 15 days, the other half of the root system is dug out. After a few days some branches of the tree are pruned so that it generates less food and also loses weight. Then the entire tree is lifted using the transplantation machine and transported to a new pit, which has minerals and medicines.
