AHMEDABAD: In just two days, BSF patrols have discovered and seized four abandoned   in Koteshwar and nearby area of  . 

  The mystery of the missing crew has set alarm bells ringing across the border security network, as the memory of the Kuber trawler, which was hijacked by Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists in 2008 to slip in the 26/11 attackers to Mumbai, is still haunting the minds of personnel.
 
 BSF officials said that on Wednesday, a small Pakistani single-engine fishing boat was discovered from the marshy Koteshwar area of Sir Creek, while on Thursday three more boats, drifting together, were seized about 3 km off Sir Creek within Indian territorial waters. Catches of fish and cooking utensils were found from the boats.
 
 Border security personnel have begun to comb the 22-km long Sir Creek channels to solve the mystery. The channels corkscrew through the Indo-Pak borders.
 
 "The Pakistanis may have seen us coming and fled. They may have traversed the knee-deep waters on foot and fled towards Pakistan while abandoning their boats," a BSF official said. "We have beefed up patrolling in the area and are conducting a combing operation to track more abandoned Pakistani boats," he said.
 
  "Recovery of about 40 kg of crabs, utensils and other fishing equipment from the Pakistani boats suggests that they were fishing boats," said a senior BSF official.
 
 "But the issue is that if a fishing boat can cross into Indian territorial waters in the swampy water channel ranging from Sindh province in Pakistan to Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, then terrorists can also take chances," he added.
