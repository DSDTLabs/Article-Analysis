GHAZIABAD: A 45-year-old disabled juice seller has accused cops posted at   of drinking pomegranate juice for free from his shop for the past one month.

 
 The seller also claimed that when he stopped serving them juice due to the steep hike in the price of the fruit, the cops started harassing customers that come to his stall under the petext of conducting checking drives.
 
 SSP Vaibhav Krishna ordered an inquiry into the matter on Tuesday after a complaint was made at Samadhan Divas.
 
 The complainant,  , a resident of Surana village, said he has been operating a government-approved kiosk at RDC for the past 13 years. He owned a PCO booth earlier, but after incurring losses in the business, began selling fruit juices some three-four years back. He also deputed one   to run this shop.
 
 Singh said the harassment started around one month back when four cops including a sub-inspector arrived at his shop and demanded juice free of cost from his helper. “When we refused to serve them, they threatened us with dire consequences. A week later they once again came to my shop and took my helper to a local police post and beat him up. They also roughed me and my wife when we went to save him. Later, Asif was booked in a false case,” he added.
 
 Now, the cops are trying to ruin my business by issuing traffic challans to people who are coming at my shop, he alleged.
 
 SHO, Kavi Nagar, Samarjeet Singh said, “I conducted an inquiry into the matter and found that customers park their vehicles in an unauthorised manner in front of his shop. He is crying foul because of action being taken against those people.”
