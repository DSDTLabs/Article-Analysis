  In the letter, Loeb wrote: "I like spending time with you out at night much more than any of my friends. What I do not like and what I will not put up with anymore is the Spanish, and no I do not like hanging out with you when you speak in Spanish, with others at the table or out with us.
  
  He added: "I may as well be alone and for someone who cares so much for what other people think, I am surprised that you think it's okay. Not only is it rude and disrespectful, it is classless. And for you to then berate, embarrass, and humiliate me in front of others when I ask you to stop is not happening anymore."
