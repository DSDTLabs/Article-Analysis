Nagpur: The Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA), on Thursday, informed the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court that it had paid Rs3.20 crore to the Maharashtra police. The amount was part of dues worth approximately Rs7.7 crore towards providing security during several international matches played at the VCA’s Jamtha stadium during last six to seven years.

 Appearing for the VCA, counsel Nikhil Gaikwad informed that remaining dues of 1.25 crore (approximately) would be paid in second instalment to the police. The first instalment was deposited into the account of Maharashtra Police Welfare Funds.
 
 A division bench led by justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and justice Sunil Shukre then adjourned the hearing for a week. The court was hearing a PIL by social worker Paramjeet Singh Kalsi through counsel Harnish Gadhia, seeking directives to the cricket association to pay these charges immediately.
 
 Earlier, VCA informed that total dues were not Rs7.7 crore as claimed by the petitioner citing various media reports. It stated that those were around Rs4.50 crore after they verified it with police. 
 
 During last hearing on November 28, the court had issued notices to Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) and Nagpur Superintendent of police, besides VCA.
 
 Earlier, Gadhia strongly argued that even though it’s a matter between two parties, it is ultimately causing a great loss to the state exchequer. He further pointed out that law and order is a matter of great importance especially in events such as a cricket match which draws people in large number.
 
 There have been several international matches played at the VCA’s Jamtha stadium since the last six to seven years for which security was deployed. It has been contended that an ordinary man needs to make payment in advance to avail of any security, however in this case there are dues amounting to crores, which are yet to be recovered, he contended.
