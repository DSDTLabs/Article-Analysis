 CHINCHWAD: The state government has directed the municipal councils and corporations to nearly double the annual budgetary allocation for the welfare of   people.

 According to a resolution issued on May 10, they will have to allocate 5% of their budget for the differently abled people. Earlier it was 3% of the annual budget.
 
 Under the revised norms, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will have to allocate Rs14-15 crore for the differently abled people. Additional commissioner Pravin Ashtikar said, “The civic body runs eight schemes for the welfare of differently abled people with the 3% funds reserved for them in the annual budget. The most important scheme is Rs2,000 monthly pension. The amount reserved for their welfare is Rs8.5 crore at present. It will nearly double to Rs14-15 crore.”
 
 He said, “We are constructing an   in Pimpri at a cost of around Rs8 crore. The increased allocation will help us implement the pension scheme better and construct the Apang Bhavan.”
 
 Prahar Apang Kranti Andolan founder and independent MLA Bachhu Kadu said it was the civic administrations generally neglected the directives given for the benefit of the differently abled people.
 
 Manav Kamble, president, Nagari Hakka Suraksha Samiti, himself a differently abled person, said, “The increased allocation of funds must not be used for giving individual benefits like various equipment. Instead, it must be used for rehabilitation, vocational education, hostels, financial assistance for surgeries and other benefits.”
 
 He said there were around 25,000 to 30,000 differently abled people across 21 types of disabilities in the civic limits.
