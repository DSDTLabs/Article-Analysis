 Kumar, who is well known for rendering songs like Aagaayam Theepidicha and Poo Avizhum Pozhudhil, is on cloud nine. His film,  , will have its world premiere on May 2, at the New York Indian Film Festival. 

 An excited Pradeep says, “I am very excited that the movie will be going to New York for the screening. The movie was made keeping the film festival circuit in mind. The story revolves around Tamil literary work, Thiruppugazh, which in the film, serves as a bridge spanning two different time periods.” Thiruppugazh, he says, left a lasting impression on Pradeep’s mind. He also selected a few poems for a chamber symphonic orchestra, which he performed at Boston, Massachusetts. 
 
 “When I began to re-look these poems after many years, I was able to look at them in a new light. With very little information about the Saint available, I decided to take the journey to relive moments of Arunagiri’s life,” shares Pradeep, who has also sung in the documentary.
