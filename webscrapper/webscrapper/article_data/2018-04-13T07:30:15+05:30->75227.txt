PANAJI: With the construction of a bund under way in  , flooding of an extensive khazan area with cultivable land has reduced marginally, but farmers have alleged that illegal fishing activities continue despite repeated complaints.

 The water level has dropped in other areas like   and illegal fishing activity is also largely under control, raising hopes for revival of agriculture. An initiative of khazan action committee ( ), specifically formed to revive agriculture by stopping sluice gate operators from flooding fields through bureaucratic actions, has partly worked.
 
 The bund is being built at an estimatedcostof Rs9 crore. The village which has several sluice gates has been flooded for some time due to breaches to bunds. Since part of the work has been completed, the water level has receded slightly but the school and panchayat building are still encircled by water.
 
 “The Neura khazan land has not dried up as expected and flooding of the fields helps illegal fishing activity which is lucrative for sluice gate operators,”  , a local activist said.
 
 A few months ago, Tiswadi mamlatdar Sapana   had inspected the flooded areas. In a few measures, she ordered sealing of sluice gates and replaced the tenants associations with an administrator. The khazan belt comprises afew villageswithhundredsof farmers who want bunds repaired first to allow drying up of fields. “Despite our complaints fishing activity continues,” Naik said.
 
 Bandodkar conceded that complaints of illegal fishing have been received. “We have instructed the administrator and sarpanch to click photographs and file a complaint with the police,” she said.
