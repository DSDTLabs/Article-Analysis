NAVI MUMBAI: A Kharghar resident,   (34) has submitted a complaint letter to the police that Rs 80,052 had been fraudulently withdrawn by using his   details.
 
 Beniwal, a deputy manager with a logistics firm, said he did not get any alerts on his phone for the transactions which took place at 10.11pm on September 9. 
 
 Beniwal said, “I learnt about the transaction when my credit card transactions were declined twice on September 10. The bank said my card was blocked as the previous day's transaction seemed “suspicious". The bank did not intimate him," he said.
