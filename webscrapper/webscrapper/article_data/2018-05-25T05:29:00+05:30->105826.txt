AHMEDABAD: A resident of   approached city   to initiate action against his wife, apart from seeking a divorce, after a paternity test showed that he was not the father of his 12-year-old ‘son’.

 Police sources said the man grew suspicious of his wife of 13 years, when he found certain chat messages on her phone. Their frequent squabbles led to a major confrontation earlier this month, after which he decided to settle the issue once and for all and sent DNA samples of his children to a private laboratory.
 
 He got the lab report earlier this week, which indicated that there was negative match between him and his oldest son — meaning he was not the boy’s biological father.
 
 “The man made this the ground for lodging a complaint. We asked him to consider the future of his wife and child, but he gave an application of complaint, asking police to probe the matter further. We asked the couple to record their statements as we are yet to figure out our course of action,” said a Ghatlodia police official.
 
 According to forensic experts, the rate failed paternity tests in the state is about 98% of cases referred to state-based forensic science laboratories (FSLs). However, most of these cases are those referred by courts and where tests have been ordered by the judiciary. FSLs don’t entertain private cases. 
 
 Officials said that the average age of the child in cases of false paternity ranges from 10 year to 12 years, when the physical resemblance to the parents starts appearing. Experts warn that such tests are emotionally taxing and should be avoided if there is even a small chance of reconciliation. 
 
 “In this case, how can a man or child forget the bond they shared for more than a decade? It is not about money in most cases but emotions,” said an official.
