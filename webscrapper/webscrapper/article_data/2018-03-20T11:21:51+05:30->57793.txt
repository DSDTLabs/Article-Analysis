 Balangir police is struggling to make significant headways into the explosion that took place on February 23. Police said they have been working on vital clues. "We got several leads. But those clues are subject to verification. Since the crime involves inter-state issues, it will take time to crack the case," a Balangir police officer said. 
 
 So far, police could only manage to ascertain that the wedding parcel was despatched from Raipur in Chhattisgarh. On February 23, groom Soumya Sekhar Sahoo and his grandmother Jemamani died following explosion of the gift while his wife Reema is still undergoing treatment at SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack.
