AURANGABAD: The   bench of the Bombay high court has refused to confirm the   given by a special court to two youths convicted of raping and murdering a four-year-old girl in 2016. It instead slapped on them a 30-year jail term without remission.

 The HC cited the case as not falling in the “rarest of rare” category and also the young age of the duo as grounds for overturning the lower court’s ruling.
 
 On January 7, 2016, the duo from Hingoli had lured the girl on the pretext of giving her a chocolate. They raped her before killing her by stuffing her mouth with raw cotton. The two youths’ parents and brother were also prosecuted, but acquitted.
 
 Public prosecutor Amarjeetsingh Girase, contesting on behalf of the state, pitched for confirmation of the capital punishment. However, the HC division bench cited the apex court ruling in the Bantu Singh versus State of MP case, which also involved a rape-murder in which the victim’s mouth was gagged.
 
 Reducing the sentence to a 30-year term, the bench said though the accused could be held guilty under section 302, it was not clear if they intended to kill the girl. Citing technical grounds, HC set aside the seven years’ imprisonment for the kidnapping charge.
