SURAT: Four officials of   VISA consulting agency were booked at Varachha police station on Sunday for alleged cheating of Rs 17.22 lakh with three persons who were promised student visa to study abroad. The accused had accepted study fees from the complainant but did not return it after his visa was rejected.

 Police booked Jigensh Patel, Vishal Mankodi and Hemang, all residents of Vadodara, and Jigar Panchal, a city resident, following complaint of Rashmin Shingala, 19, a student. The accused are officials of   (MIPL). Shingala had visited the office of MIPL at Poddar Arcade in Varachha and paid Rs 4 lakh to get admission in a college in Canada in 2015.
 
 Meanwhile, Shingala’s visa was rejected and he demanded the fees back from the MIPL. He was given a cheque by Panchal but it was rejected by the bank. Shingala contacted the MIPL office in Vadodara many times and the other accused promised him to return the money with interest. The accused continued paying interest for the money at rate of 1.25%.
 
 During Shingala’s last visit, the accused promised that they will return the money before December 2017. Shingala came to know that a few other visa aspirants’ money was not returned by the accused either. Jaimin Patel had paid Rs 7.48 lakh and   paid Rs 3.73 lakh to the accused company.
 
 Police investigation revealed that the accused were booked in 2016 also for a similar fraud. “The accused did not return money to the complainant. We are investigating the case to find out more details,” police said.
