Nagpur: After much controversy, Nagpur University on Friday appointed Rajashree Vaishnav as new dean of interdisciplinary studies. Along with her, former pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande has been reappointed as dean of ‘commerce and management’ faculty while law college principal Shrikant Komawar was again handed over the charge of humanities.

 Interestingly, the post of science dean wasn’t filled up as expected, as a petition opposing his appointment was pending with chancellor C Vidya Sagar Rao,   officials said. However, VC SP Kane clarified he had taken a legal opinion on filling up the post and decided to wait for it.
 
 He also stated that earlier dean Maheshkumar Yenkie wasn’t reappointed as there were many issues, including his retirement. “His case for extension is already before Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court. Even if he wins, he would get at the most 11 months until he is 62. Moreover, the dean’s post would be filled up on long term basis, as government hasn’t granted their posts to the universities. So we decided to wait and watch,” he told TOI.
 
 On Kakde’s appointment, the VC stated that they would await legal opinion. Kakde is believed to be close to pro-VC Pramod Yeole and is lobbying hard for the science dean’s post. Earlier also, his nomination as dean of interdisciplinary studies by overlooking experienced and senior faculty members had raised eyebrows.
