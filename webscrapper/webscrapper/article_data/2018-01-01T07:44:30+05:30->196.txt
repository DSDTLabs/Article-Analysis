AHMEDABAD: It all began as a task assigned to them under the Managing Social Projects (MSP) programme, but for these nine first-year management students from Nirma University, the TOI-Times Foundation   has provided an important lesson of life – nothing goes to waste.

  Abhishek   and his classmates spent close to three months visiting hostel rooms, faculty doorsteps and even societies nearby every week to collect waste paper and newspapers. In all they collected 750kg of waste. 
 
 “The whole experience was humbling. Our motivation was that the waste we collect right now will redeem needy children by helping them access to education,” says Dasgupta. 
 
  
  In the process, the management students also realised the amount of waste that their institution generated — as newspapers and stationery. “We are going to continue this program in the forthcoming months and devise a strategy to inspire individuals outside our campus to undertake such tasks,” says Dasgupta.
 
  
  The   drive even inspired ‘Line O Matic Graphic’, a firm involved in printing stationery to contribute towards the Pasti ki Masti drive. In their first effort, they distributed more than 650 sets of school notebooks to children of municipal schools number 7 and 8 in Sabarmati area. A company communique said, “It was proud to be part of   campaign.”
