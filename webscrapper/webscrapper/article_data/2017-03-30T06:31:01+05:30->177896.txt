HYDERABAD: In a heartening development, a brother-sister duo from Hyderabad has started a   campaign on  .org to raise money for their friend, who is expected to undergo a   at Bengaluru soon.

 Amal, a 19-year-old student of BSc Electronics at Bhavan’s   (BVC) in Sainikpuri, was diagnosed with Fanconi Anemia, a rare bone marrow disease after he fainted in college during a game in January this year. With all efforts to raise funds through NGOs and friends being of little help, Nikhil M, also a student of BVC, decided to turn to crowdfunding. He was assisted by his sister Divya M in this venture.
 
 “The type of bone marrow disease Amal has been diagnosed with is very rare and occurs in about 1 in 1,30,000 births. His family has already coughed up around Rs 10 lakh for treatment and tests at a hospital in Hyderabad. It was only after this that we found a suitable donor for Amal. He is now undergoing tests along with his donor, a Bengaluru-based boy at Narayana Rudalaya hospital,” said Divya.
 
 The campaign that the siblings have launched is titled ‘Please help my friend, Amal, fight this rare bone marrow’ and is ‘live’ on the crowdfunding platform Milaap. The campaign has so far raised Rs 10,83,987 of the total Rs 23 lakh required for the procedure, which is scheduled for April 8. Details of the campaign, which has garnered 661 supporters, have been shared more than 7,000 times through various social media channels.
 
 Even Tollywood stars such as Nani, Lakshmi Manchu, Vijay Deverakonda, Mohana Krishna Indraganti have come forward to support the boy and have spread the word through their official social media handles and pages.
 
 “While the cost of the procedure has been pegged at over Rs 23 lakh, we have been informed that there would be additional costs since Amal will have to stay at the hospital for four months if the procedure is successful. The family is not able to meet these expenses. Crowdfunding seemed the quickest way to raise money,” Divya said.
