Nagpur: The state co-operation and marketing ministry which is saddled with 25.25 lakh quintals of Tur dal it procured in last kharif season from its own resources, is now finding it difficult to dispose it.  The ministry through a government resolution issued on the new year day has formed an empowered cabinet sub-committee to devise ways of disposing of the dal and arrive at a proper pricing mechanism to minimize losses. The year 2016-17 saw a record production of Tur dal in Maharashtra. Farmers were attracted to Tur and went aggressively for that crop in view of the high price ruling in the market at that time for the commodity. However, it resulted in a glut and consequent drop in rates in open market. Bowing to the political pressure mounted by the Opposition and the plight of farmers who had to sell it at below minimum support price of around Rs5000 a quintal, the state as well as the Central government agencies through market intervention scheme procured Tur from farmers at slightly above MSP. Now, the state is finding it tough to dispose of the tur mainly as its plan to sell it at Rs55 a kg through fair-price shops found few takers. The GR says with chances of the stock getting exhausted through public distribution system looking bleak because of lukewarm demand, it is decided to sell it in open market to private shops. To finalize modalities of this sale and to arrive at a proper pricing, the ministry has formed a cabinet sub-committee comprising marketing minister Subhash Deshmukh, finance minister Sudhir Mugantiwar and food-civic supplies minister Girish Bapat, marketing department’s secretary and state cooperative marketing federation’s administrative director. Meanwhile, the state government’s school education department, medical education and women/child welfare department’s have offered supplies of Tur by the marketing department at Rs80 per kg price. These three departments would together require nearly 9 lakh quintals.
