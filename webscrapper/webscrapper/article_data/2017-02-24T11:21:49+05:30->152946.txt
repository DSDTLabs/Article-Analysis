NAGPUR: The 2017   (NMC) election saw rebellion on an unprecedented scale, but most of the rebels, and those who switched sides at the last moment, bit the dust.

 Among the few exceptions are   and Ramesh Punekar. Patil, a NCP corporator in the outgoing body, had joined the BJP at the last moment. Punekar, a BJP corporator, had joined Congress a few days before the election. Both emerged victorious.
 
 Vishakha Joshi, a BJP office-bearer with RSS background, had jumped into the fray from ward 15 on a Shiv Sena ticket. Two other members in her panel, Pankaj Patel and Dattatraya Pitale, had also sought BJP tickets but jumped into the fray as Sena candidates after the BJP rebuffed them. All three candidates performed poorly at the hustings.
 
 Vishakha Maind, a BJP corporator, had also rebelled against the party and contested as an independent by forming a panel of four. She also met the same fate.
 
 Shripad Risaldar, a RSS activist and close aide of union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, had contested as an independent after being denied a BJP ticket. He fared very poorly. BJP corporator Sulochana Kowe too had entered the fray as an independent and formed a panel with Congress corporator Abha Pande. While Pande won, Kowe bit the dust.
 
 Dipak Kapse, a Congress corporator, had contested as an independent from ward 30 but came a poor third. Kishor Dorle, an independent corporator, had joined the Congress just before the elections and was given a party ticket. However, as the panel was not to his liking, he decided to form his own panel of independents. All the four candidates performed poorly.
 
 Bhavna Dhakne, a BRP-BMS corporator, had joined the Congress a few weeks before the elections. Her husband Prashant was given a Congress ticket. However, he lost to the BJP candidate.
