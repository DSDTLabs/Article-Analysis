BENGALURU: A gang of dacoits allegedly broke into a house in   town on the outskirts of the city, threatened the landlord at gun-point, blindfolded and tied him up before looting his house on Tuesday night. The gang fled with booty worth more than Rs 1 crore, including 2.8kg of gold. 

  Attibele police say the gang of about 10 broke into the house of  , 60, a resident of Pillareddy Layout, at 8pm. Reddy was alone at home at that time and gang assaulted him when they barged in. 
 
  "My wife and two daughters were out at the wedding of a relative," Reddy said. "I also attended the reception and returned home by 7.30pm. About half an hour later, somebody knocked on the door and I opened it. Four people barged into the house." 
 
 One of them slashed Reddy's hand with a knife and another brandished a gun while warning him not to scream for help. They then tied   and blindfolded him. Reddy claims they were joined by others as they began to ransack the house.
 
  "Initially, Reddy wasn't sure of what the gang had stolen and said he would enquire with his wife and daughter," police said. "This morning (Wednesday), he informed us that the gang fled with Rs 4.5 lakh in cash, 2.8kg of gold ornaments and 6kg of silver articles. They also took his ring and watch." 
 
 Reddy claimed the dacoits spoke to each other in   and used broken Kannada with him. All of the gang members wore black shirts, were unmasked and aged between 25 and 30 years. 
 
 Reddy insisted he would be able to identify the gang if he sees them again.
 
  Police said there was a power cut in the area due to rain and wind a few minutes before the gang struck. The incident came to light around 9.40pm when Reddy's neighbour found the door open and entered the house out of curiosity. Police have collected fingerprints and other evidence from the spot and a probe is under way.
