DEHRADUN: Amidst complaints by the Congress party that PM Modi’s participation in the annual commanders’ conference at   may be used by the BJP to gain political mileage ahead of the polls, the   (EC) late on Friday gave its nod to the conference albeit with a few riders.
 
  In a letter addressed to the secretary, ministry of defence, the senior principal secretary of the EC wrote, “No objection to the holding of combined commanders’ conference at IMA, Dehradun on 21.1.20017 is hereby granted subject to strict observations of conditions by dignitaries attending the conference.”
  
  The letter went on to spell out the conditions -- “The official visit shall not be combined with any public meeting” and “No media briefing, media interaction, press release or announcement in connection with serving soldier or ex-serviceman which may affect the electorate in the five poll going states including Uttarakhand shall be made.”
  
  The Congress had made the PM’s visit for the conference a major political issue and raised the matter before CEC Nasim Zaidi during his recent two-day visit to Uttarakhand to review the poll preparations and security arrangements. CM   had also held a press conference in Delhi where he had stated that the state unit of the BJP was prominently banking on PM Modi for the polls and his visit for the conference may be used by the party in a manner which violates the model code of conduct.
