NEW DELHI: They are accused of defrauding the Austrian government, but three Afghan   who posed as children, likely so they aren't turned away, have shown that the war in   is alive and well. 

 The refugees, who pretended to be child  , ended up using Austrian social benefits like healthcare and basic care, worth as much as Â£87,000. They were sent to jail for five-six months, the Daily Express reported. 
 
 "People said it was better to apply as a minor as then I cannot be deported back. I was afraid that I would then be killed in Afghanistan like my father was," said one of the three who admitted lying about his age. 
  
 In the first 10 months of 2016, as many as 16,054 minors, of whom 4,076 were unaccompanied, applied for asylum in  , the newspaper said.
 
 Authorities brought a case against the three refugees after court-ordered medical reports revealed the men were older than they claimed on their Austria asylum applications.
 
 Two of the accused denied the accusation saying that they didn't know their birthdays and that their parents are illiterate and used the Afghan calendar. The Afghan Solar Hijri calendar, used in Iran and Afghanistan, has six months of 31 days, then five months with 30 days each and then one month of 29 days, the newspaper said.
 
 The judge didn't believe the two defendants who claimed to not know their birthdays.
 
 "They knowingly gave false information so they could stay in Austria," the judge said.
