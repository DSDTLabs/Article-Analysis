While   is a dark thriller, the bright spots in the movie belong to the scenes with Prithviraj and Narain. The duo, who played buddies for the fourth time, eased into their roles–mostly because they are friends in real life too, says Narain.

  For Narain, it’s been some time since he starred in a big budget film in Malayalam and hence the positive audience feedback for the role has been heartening.
 
 “My previous role as a comic villain in Kavi Uddheshichathu…? was something I had never done before and I enjoyed that challenge. But in Adam Joan, it was a mature character and I could easily connect to his serious outlook,” he says.
 
 The cast of the film too had helped him be at ease. “We shot in Scotland for almost two months. It had Prithviraj, Bhavana and Lena – all of whom are friends. Also, we stayed at an apartment complex, rather than hotel rooms. So, it was like a lengthy vacation, shooting with people who you knew really well,” the actor says.
 
 On his camaraderie with Prithviraj with whom he had worked in Classmates, Ayaalum Njanum Thammil and Robin Hood, Narain says, “Prithvi and I were supposed to do a film with a big director last year but that didn’t work out for some reason. So when Adam Joan was offered, I didn’t have to think twice before taking it up. We are friends in real life and so even while acting that equation must have seeped in. I am glad that it worked for the better.”
 Narain says he is currently in discussions for two Malayalam films but his upcoming release is a Tamil movie titled Othaikku Othai, which also stars Atharvaa.
