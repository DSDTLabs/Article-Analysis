NEW DELHI: Before introducing   criteria for  , did Delhi government conduct geographical   in areas of the city?

 The Delhi high court on Monday posed this question while examining the validity of the latest admission norms issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE), pointing out that the court itself had last year ordered such an exercise be done before next year’s notification.
 
 “Was a mapping survey done by the government before neighbourhood criteria? How many good schools are in a given area, how many public schools, what is their capacity, did you do that?” Justice Manmohan asked additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain.
 
 The court also raised apprehensions that the government may push communities towards “ghettoisation” if it insists that locals should send their children only to nearby schools. “Delhi has a high population density, no one will go beyond 3km radius. A healthy mix of students is needed so that children from varied backgrounds can understand each other,” the court said while hearing Delhi government’s stand on petitions challenging its notification on private unaided schools to admit children in   using the neighbourhood norm.
 
 However, Jain, appearing for DoE, tried to assure the court that the intention behind the move is “public interest” and to reduce travel time for a child. “A child will be less exposed to pollution. Also, less travel means less fatigue. The neighbourhood idea needs breathing space, courts are always their to step in if it fails,” he explained.
 
 A section of parents have submitted in court that the AAP government’s order is illegal as it deprives them of their fundamental right to admit children to school of their choice.
