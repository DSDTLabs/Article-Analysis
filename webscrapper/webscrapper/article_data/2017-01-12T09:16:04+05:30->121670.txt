LUCKNOW: A notice in English to use   in official communication at   caught attention of teachers and students. Amused by the notice, students felt, it was making mockery of Hindi language and its use by the university. 

 Issued by the BBAU vice-chancelor and uploaded on the universty’s website, the notice reads, ‘All faculty members/officers are requested to make use of Hindi as much as possible in official communications. This be treated as most urgent.’ 
 
 The circular, however, hasn't gone down well with the students and teachers. “Issuing a notice in English to promote Hindi is a ridiculous way of promoting the Indian language by the university head,’’ said a student without willing to be named. 
 
 Another student,   said, “These orders are issued in a haste, without even realising the absurdity of it. The university should pay attention to the content of all notices before uploading them on the online portal.’’ 
 
 BBAU, in line with the Central government’s directives to make   in administrative offices had earlier asked all its faculty members and staff to use Hindi language in official communication. But not much was done by the staff. The university has once again asked the office-bearers and faculty to promote Hindi language by using it more.
