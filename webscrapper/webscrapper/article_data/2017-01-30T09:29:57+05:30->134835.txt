GUWAHATI: Former AGP minister and current   legislator   is set to be elected as the speaker of the state assembly on the opening day of the BJP-led government's first full budget session on Monday. The speaker's post fell vacant when   resigned after his appointment as president of the BJP state unit. 

 Goswami, the consensus candidate of the BJP-AGP-BPF alliance, was the only candidate to file nomination papers for the speaker's post on Sunday. 
 
 Goswami is the younger brother of eminent space scientist  , also known as India' 'Moon Man'. Jitendra was the principal scientist of India's moon mission, Chandrayaan-1, and is currenty chairman of the advisory board for the follow-up mission, Chandrayaan-2.
 
 Deputy speaker Dilip Kumar Paul on Sunday evening chaired an all-party meeting to discuss the smooth functioning of the budget session.
 
 The state government will present the budget, its first, for 2017-18 on February 7, in which it is expected to do away with the 'non-plan and plan' categorization of funds. Instead, the new budget will have two heads - capital and revenue. 
 
 Another new feature will be the renaming of the state plan as State own Priority Development (SoPD).
 
 Meanwhile, opposition   leader   said his party will seek answers from the government on the extent of implementation of promises the government had made in the interim budget it had presented last year.
