Police are trying to identify the attackers with the help of the video.
 
 DCP (west) Vijay Kumar said that a witness informed police about firing inside the pub at 11.30pm. Officers from the Rajouri Garden police station reached the spot and it was found that a group of men had beaten up Garg and his brother Nikunj.
 
 The group had apparently gathered at the pub for a birthday party and kept ordering drinks. However after 11pm, the waiter refused to serve them and instead gave them the bill. This enraged the men, who asked for the manager and started arguing with Garg. When they smashed a beer bottle on on Garg’s head, Nikunj tried to intervene, but he too was attacked with cutlery and bottles. 
 
 In the mobile video, the men were seen heckling Nikunj while the security guards took a bleeding Garg away.
 
 In his complaint, Garg told police that he could identify two of the accused — from the names they used to book the tables — as Rahul and Manish. He said that there were also a few women in the group of around 15 people. “We have registered a case and are looking into the video in which one of them was seen holding a gun like object which is being verified,” said DCP, Kumar.
