BENGALURU: Residents of Kasturinagar decided to take matters into their own hands and cleared 12 years of uncleared debris from under Benniganahalli flyover, popularly known as  . 

 "The debris had been lying there for over 12 years. We approached   officials several times, but nothing came out of it," said Ravikiran N, a resident of the east Bengaluru locality.
 
 "The flyover falls between two wards, 50 and 51. BBMP officials from both wards w ashed their hands of, saying it was not under their jurisdiction. On filing an RTI, we found the flyover belonged to ward number 51. Despite this, no action was taken," he pointed out. 
 
  Instead of wasting more time, members of   and   decided to clean up the mess themselves. Through crowd-funding, residents raised about Rs 4.5 lakh; they used the money to arrange for 50 trucks to ferry the garbage, and painted the flyover pillars red.
