GHAZIABAD: The deadline for the   project covering 9.41km has been extended by a year from June 2017 to June 2018.

 Announcing the new deadline,   (DMRC) managing director Mangu Singh said the construction work was afoot on the project and June 2017 was an impossible deadline. “I don't know the exact figures but the civil construction of the project is 80-85% complete. It is due for completion in June 2018,” Singh said at a private function of Sanskar Group of Colleges at Ghaziabad. 
 
 However, Vijay Kumar Yadav, GDA vice-chairman, told TOI that the project would be completed by November this year. “The project has been pending for long and was to be ready by June 2017 but some work remains to be done. So it will be over by October or November 2017,” Yadav said.
 
 When asked about the ongoing construction at Arthala in Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad, despite a land issue with the sales tax department, which currently owns the land, Singh said, “DMRC still doesn’t possess the land but hopes for an early solution.”
 
 Singh said that DMRC had anticipated land problems like this when it began the construction here. 
 
 “That is why the viaduct we are using here is independent of the station. So we will complete the Metro line construction anyway,” Singh said. “In the worst-case scenario, if the land issue is not resolved, we will bypass the Arthala station and will still run the Metro line,” he added.
 
 Out of the total budget of Rs 2,210 crore for the construction of the Metro line, the DMRC chief said an estimated Rs 900 crore has been received while Rs 1,310 crore is still pending. 
 
 GDA has paid Rs 590 crore, Avas Vikas Parishad Rs 50 crore, and UPSIDC Rs 3.3 crore.
 
 Mangu Singh was speaking at a skill development workshop held at Sanskar Group of Colleges, Ghaziabad.
