Actress   Chakraborty lives somewhere between   and Madhuban; the latter is not functional anymore. Speaking of her memories of these theatres, she said, "In my growing up years, I used to catch films in these two theatres. I remember an old man used to sell aloo chat in front of Madhuban. After the theatre shut down, I would still look for him. In these theatres, I used to catch night shows with my mother. Despite having dinner at home, I would enter the hall with packets of chips and popcorn. Ma used to scream at me every time I bought munch-ons post dinner! But it was fun. Eating at theatres was more important than watching films. I still have my favourites — I love the chicken patty at   and like to gulp it down with soft drinks in glass bottles. Now, when I go for premiere shows at Priya or  , there’s no time for quick bites but I still prefer popcorn in cellophane packets than the buckets that are more popular now."
