CALANGUTE: A huge mango tree came crashing down near the Candolim church in the early hours of Sunday, bringing down   poles and causing a power breakdown in many surrounding areas for much of the day, besides disrupting  .

 Power was restored by Sunday afternoon after staff from the electricity department reconnected the power cables, after clearing the uprooted tree.
 
 In the last couple of weeks, Candolim area reported at least three old mango trees crashing down because of neglect, bringing down electricity cables and leading to major power failures. Two such incidents were reported in Saipem ward itself.
 
 Sources from the department said people are neglecting mango trees in their properties, which leads to rotting of trunks and such trees come crashing. “Since the trees are in private properties, at most, we can prune the branches which jut out onto roads. The owners need to take better care of trees in their properties,” an employee with the electricity department said.
