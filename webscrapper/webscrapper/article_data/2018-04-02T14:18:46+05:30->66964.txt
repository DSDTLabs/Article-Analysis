SURAT: People used to get water when digging 100 feet in the ground in the coastal city of Surat until a few decades ago. Now people need to dig up to 200 feet deep because the groundwater level has dropped. 

 This is why   (SMC) has announced a subsidy of Rs20,000 per unit for people if they set up a rain harvesting system (RHS). Of the nearly 4 lakh structures in the city, only 3,500 units so far have RHS. 
 
 “The General Development Control Regulations have a provision for setting up of RHS at the time of construction and the building use certificate (BUC) is provided only when it has been installed. However, the regulations have not been seriously followed since 2006. Many had installed the system but never maintained it,” said an SMC official. 
 
 K H  , SMC additional city engineer, hydraulic department, said, “Lack of knowledge has led to the dropping of the water level. People need to act immediately and set up underground water recharge and rain harvesting system. If every housing society has at least one RHS, then it will help the rainwater to percolate through the soil and raise the level of the groundwater.”
 
 The SMC had in 2016 passed a proposal to give subsidy of Rs 20,000 to people who installed RHS. However, the plan was never given the push it needed. This is why only 400 units had installed RHS besides the 3,000 high-rise constructed after 2006. 
 
 An RHS with 12-inch borewell costs about Rs 1 lakh. An SMC team will guide the citizens in installing RHS. 
 
 “People have to recharge the groundwater source because over-dependence on   will not help us any more,” Khatwani said.
