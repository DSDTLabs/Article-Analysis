JAIPUR: Architects will now issue a `completion certificate' to the   in the state. The   (UDH) department has constituted a panel of 10 architects to issue certificate to high rises in development authorities, urban improvement trust and local bodies.

 It is mandatory for developers to procure   who are constructing buildings up to or above 15 metres. Similarly, if height is less than 15 metres, but area of a plot size is more than 5,000 sq metre, the developer will require a completion certificate from the civic body. “After constituting the panel, a order were released on Monday. This order became effective in all the 191   (ULB) and development authorities from Tuesday,“ said a senior UDH official In present scenario, the completion certificate is issued after receiving a town planning department nod that building has been constructed as per the approved layout plan. “The officials do not visit the sites and issue completion certificate without any inspection. The department claims that there is shortage of staff and inspecting each building is not possible. This has led to many illegal practices in the past.“ said senior official.
 
 Now, the developers have to submit a layout plan after getting it verified by the registered architect firm. Once the construction is complete, the panel member would inspect the site to issue completion certificate. In case the architect finds a fault in the construction, a case will be registered against the developer under the council of architects.
 
 The urban local bodies will also have to issue certificate within three days time after a developer applies to procure the certificate.
 
 The number of residential apartments in the recent past have increased at an exponential rate with 20,000 apartments under construction in the state capital itself.
