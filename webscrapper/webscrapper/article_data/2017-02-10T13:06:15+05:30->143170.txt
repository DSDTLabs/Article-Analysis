But then he realizes that Preeto ( ) is standing outside their room. He immediately changes the tone of their conversation and pretends to be worried for Surbhi. Preeto becomes happy and leaves. After she goes, Harman tells Surbhi that their relationship is going to be fake forever, but Surbhi has no regrets as she says she is willing to do anything for Soumya ( ).
