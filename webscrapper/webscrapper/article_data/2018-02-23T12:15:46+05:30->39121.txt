PORVORIM: Chief minister   on Thursday told his   colleagues that he would clear files and would also chair the cabinet meeting next week.

 “Parrikar told us he will hold the next cabinet meeting scheduled for Wednesday,” power minister   said. He also said the chief minister would not be meeting people right now. 
 
 Parrikar, who had complained of stomach pain on February 14, was referred to Mumbai’s   by doctors of the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC), Bambolim, the very next day. He was under the care of Dr P  , chairman of Lilavati Hospital’s department of surgical oncology.
 
 Town and country planning minster Vijai Sardesai said the chief minister showed his grit by coming to the House despite having health issues. “In such a situation, a person would have normally slept at home, but he (Parrikar) chose to come to the House and present the budget,” Sardesai said.
 
 Terming the budget ‘pro-people’, the   legislator said its focus on employment, health and agriculture has been welcomed by all. “It fulfils the aspirations of the people of Goa and we will ensure it is implemented through constant perseverance in the cabinet,” Sardesai said. 
 
 He reiterated that Parrikar would hold Wednesday’s cabinet meeting. “All will be well from Tuesday; this is the message we got at the cabinet meet today,” he added.
 
 Panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho said Parrikar has emerged like a superman, describing the development as the most positive sign the government has seen in recent times. “It is a strong signal that the government is strong and that there is no need to worry about the political situation, present and future,” he said. 
 
 “We will miss him for a short while till he recovers completely,” Godinho, who is also Dabolim MLA, said.
