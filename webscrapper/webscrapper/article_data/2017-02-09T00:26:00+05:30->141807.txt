Bhopal: Passengers on board the Chennai-New Delhi GT express created ruckus and protested at Misrod railway station on Tuesday after the train was halted for more than an hour and half following engine failure. Passengers were already harassed as the train was already running late by 14 hours.

 At about 8am the train halted with a sudden jerk near Misrod station. After waiting for about 30 minutes when passengers checked out with the engine staff standing beside engine, they were told about engine failure. “We waited for about one and half hour but the engine was not replaced. We are thankful that the loco pilot alerted and helped railways to avert a tragedy. Passengers were already angry over the delay train and their anger bust out,” said Sulabh Karmakar, a passenger at GT express.
 
 I A Siddiqui, spokesperson for Bhopal rail division said, “A tragedy was averted and technical team responded as soon as we got the information. The train left within an hour from Misrod station after the engine was replaced.”
 
 The incident took place at about 8-8:30am in morning. “These small technical issues, engine failures ands track faults are scaring away railway passengers,” said Mahesh Kumar, another passenger, who got down the train to protest at Misrod station between Bhopal and Hoshangabad.
