LUCKNOW: The Union Budget has turned out to be a mixed bag for the Dalit population in poll-bound UP. With a 35% hike in budgetary allocation for the scheduled castes in the country, on the face of it, the Budget appears to be doling out the goodies for the SC population. While this appears to have been done with an eye on elections in UP and Punjab, which have the highest numbers and density of SCs, a closer look at some of the schemes meant for them shows a dip in the allocation. 

 Finance minister Arun Jaitley announced a hike in the allocation for SCs from Rs 38,833 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 52,393 crore, but certain schemes listed under the social welfare ministry’s   and Empowerment, indicates that the increased allocation in funding for SCs also accounts for the increase in total government expenditure -- higher than the past two years. While the government has stepped up allocation in schemes like the   for SCs, there is also a sharp decrease in the allocations for schemes like the Pre-Matric Scholarship for SC students. The scheme targets SC students in classes IX and X and aims to minimise school drop out rates. This scheme was allotted Rs 842 crore in 2015-16, which was reduced in Budget 2016-17 to Rs 550 crore. For 2017-18, however, the Budget estimate for the scheme has been reduced to only Rs 50 crore. While this amount is the all India allocation, it will result in nearly crippling the scheme’s implementation in UP. 
 
 The other scheme for Dalits that faces a dip in the allocation is the pre-matric scholarship for children of people engaged in unclean occupation, including manual scavengers, sweepers, tanners, flayers, manhole and open drain cleaners, and rag-pickers. From an allocation of Rs 10 crore in 2015-16, the budget was reduced to Rs 2 crore in 2016-17, and to Rs 2.70 crore for 2017-18.
 
 Similarly, the government’s schemes to   and their dependants by giving them loans, subsidies, and training have seen a gradual depletion over the years. For 2017-18, the government has allocated only Rs 5 crore for such schemes.
