KOLKATA:   Anupam Singha's murder case took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the two prime accused - Anupam's wife Manua and her paramour   - were produced again in   after their 10-day   ended. 

 Though Manua - who reportedly had a key role in her husband's murder, and was given 14 days' judicial custody on Saturday - was unfazed, her defence lawyer was attacked by some agitators on the court premises while he speaking to the media. 
 
 During interrogation, Manua reportedly told police that she strongly desired to marry Ajit soon after her release from jail.
 
 Kolkata-based travel agency manager Anupam, who was also an employee in a money exchange firm, was found murdered at his home in Hridaypur's Taltala on May 3. Police arrested Manua and Ajit from Barasat on May 17. Interrogating the duo, police surmise that Ajit had called up Manua and made her listen to her husband scream while he was being murdered. 
 
 On Saturday morning, Manua and Ajit were taken to Barasat court under tight security. Barasat CJM Sandip Karmakar remanded them in judicial custody. It was while Manua's lawyer Sushovan Mitra was telling the media that his client was falsely implicate in her husband's murder that the locals got angry and attacked him. He allegedly received injuries in his chest and shoulder after the mob beat him up. Police rescued him and took him to hospital.
