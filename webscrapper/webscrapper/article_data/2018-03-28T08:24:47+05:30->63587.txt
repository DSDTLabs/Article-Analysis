CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Tuesday issued notice to the Haryana government on a plea seeking directions for it on giving   of Rs 4,000 per quintal as announced by the Centre for procurement of mustard seeds. The matter reached the HC in the wake of a petition filed by Akhtar Ali, a resident of Nuh. The petitioner also sought directions to set up purchase centres for agriculture produce in Nuh or adjoining areas. 

 Counsel for the petitioner   informed the HC that the state government was purchasing mustard seeds at Rs 3,000 per quintal instead of Rs 4,000, because of which farmers were facing huge financial loss. 
 
 He further stated that the state government was yet to start buying the crop at the specified rate in   and middlemen or brokers at the grain markets were purchasing mustard seeds from farmers at a price far less than the MSP of Rs 4,000 per quintal due to delay in the procurement process.
 
 Khan further argued that the Haryana government had announced the start of procurement process at the MSP to prevent distress sale by farmers but the state's agency, Hafed was yet to start the process in Nuh. Advocate   further stated that people of Mewat area were very poor and agriculture was the main occupation. 
 
 "Around six lakh quintal of mustard crop was grown every year in Mewat area but the farmers were not getting the MSP for the crop," he argued. The matter will now come up for hearing on April 21.
