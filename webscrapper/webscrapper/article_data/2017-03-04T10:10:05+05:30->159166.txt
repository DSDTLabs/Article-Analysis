JALANDHAR:   has condemned the threats issued to DU student and martyr's daughter  , but also praised   for inculcating patriotism among students.

 Sharma is the first leader from SAD-BJP alliance to speak on the issue even as SAD leaders preferred silence despite other parties criticizing use of foul language and threats against her. His video message, recorded at the memorial of martyrs Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev , says, “You put your point forth and here is freedom of expression and we honour it. Some opposed you and some supported you and that was also their right. But some people in a fit of rage used wrong words and threats which I condemn. I also praise ABVP for filing a complaint with Delhi police for threats being given to you.“
 
 Sharma said though there was controversy over her father being a Kargil martyr, the fact remained that he was one (a martyr). “ All should wish for peace and we can be war mongers. But if war is forced on us, we have to fight.“
 
 “You've said you are not afraid of ABVP . Let me tell you, I'm proud that I worked with ABVP for 20 years. When the controversy started, I wanted to speak but then thought it will take political colour and ABVP can defend itself. But now, when it has already been given a political colour and politicians are posing challenges to ABVP , like Captain (Amarinder) demanding a ban on it and   terming it `a group of goondas', I should reveal that ABVP has a glorious past,“ he said.
