CHENNAI: Contract workers hired by the   municipality on Tuesday were clearing sewage from an open drain adjacent to the state transport corporation depot without any protective gear. Even worse, the municipality had been allowing sewage water to enter a fresh water body near the depot.

 According to municipality officials, work on widening the drain that carries rainwater and sewerage from east Tambaram localities started three weeks ago. “The drain’s width will be widened from four feet to over 10 feet,” a municipality official said. To facilitate widening work, the municipality engaged contract labourers to clear sludge from the drain. TOI spotted workers standing in ankle deep sewage water and cleaning it with bare hands. When it was put to them that their work amounted to  , banned by law in the country, the workers told TOI that they were not provided protective gear by the municipality.
 
 When contacted for a response, a municipality engineer told he would “inquire with the contractor” if protective equipment had not been provided. A Narayanan, founder of social welfare organisation  , said the municipality’s actions were “completely unacceptable”.
 
 “Court orders (on manual scavenging) are treated casually by government officers,” he said, adding that there could be no excuse to non-provision of protective gear to workers. The workers said the municipality had drained out sewerage from the drain into a nearby fresh water body called   lake. Investigation revealed that upon completion of widening the drain, it would still empty sewerage into the fresh water lake. “Kadaperi lake is the septic tank of Tambaram,” said a staffer at the MTC depot.
 
 Officials said underground sewage network worth Rs 160 crore is currently being built in Tambaram neighbourhood. “Once it is functional, open drains will not carry sewage,” an official added.
