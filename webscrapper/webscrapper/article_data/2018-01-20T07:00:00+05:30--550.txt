Director   has been making news ever since the announcement of the film Aami, which is based on  , who is the most talked about artist of all times when it comes to Indian writing. 

 Kamal tells us how well prepared he is with regard to the film and the audiences' reception. He said, "Madhavikutty herself was a topic of discussion throughout her life, so controversies will definitely be there. If controversies happen, we will have to face it. There are still a lot of rumours on her conversion and the reasons for it. We have heard many stories but none of us know what exactly happened. Also, we know about her relationship with her husband only through her words."
 
 He added, "I have used my creative freedom there and I believe as a filmmaker I have the liberty to do it. 
 If someone has the freedom to write about  , a filmmaker has the freedom to make a film too on her. I have gone through the legal side. I have bought the rights from her custodians â€” her children and have taken their permission."
 
 Ask him if he was pained when people started judging the movie, even before it was released, and he says such things are part and parcel of any film for that matter. He said, "It is the flip side of social media era. And it is having an adverse effect on creative people, especially filmmakers. People make judgments listening to half-baked information. The prejudices and bias are born even before finding out what the reality is. On the other side, I have accepted that Aami will have to face some controversies as it deals with a very sensitive topic. As it has already created a few discussions, it will be scrutinised more. All I want to say is that watch the movie without prejudices."
