Nagpur: A 20-year-old girl, who was searching for a restaurant to get a bottle of water, was crushed to death under the front wheels of a heavy truck on Monday around 10am. The tragic accident happened near Kapsi Bridge in Kalamna. The deceased, Balvidya Nagardhane, was riding pillion and returning from Ramtek to the city on her two-wheeler along with a female friend. The unidentified truck collided with Nagardhane’s vehicle as the driver, Tanushree Bedkar (19), took a U-turn without noticing the giant vehicle coming towards the city. Kalamna police, who were alerted by control room, reached the spot and sent the body for post mortem at Mayo Hospital. Cops said the truck driver is yet to be traced as he ran away. Cops registered an offence of negligent driving following a complaint by Bedkar, a native of Ballarshah, Chandrapur. Nagardhane, a resident of Tumsar in Bhandara district, was staying at a rented room at Sakkardara for the last two years along with her elder brother Apekshit, a student of engineering. Cops said the deceased, a student of Bachelor of Computer Applications second year, had gone to Ramtek temple along with three friends early on Monday morning.  Midway, due to the rise in temperature, all girls felt thirsty and were searching for a restaurant. They searched several shops on Bhandara Road but did not get bottled water. “Bedkar, riding without a helmet, suddenly took a U-turn from the divider, without seeing the oncoming truck,” said senior PI Sunil Bonde. Bonde also said that Nagardhane’s head was crushed under the wheels while Bedkar miraculously survived the accident with minor injuries.
