CHANDIGARH: The Opposition’s presidential candidate and former Lok Sabha speaker   on Sunday said support from Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was crucial to her bid to win the polls.

 “I am in regular touch with the Aam Aadmi Party. They are giving me full support,” Kumar told reporters in a brief interaction at   in Chandigarh.
 
 Kumar was on a visit to Punjab to meet Punjab and   MLAs and MPs to drum up support for the July 17 presidential poll. She, however, did not reveal if she had written any letter to AAP’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal or any of his MLAs in Punjab.
 
 The Congress and AAP were recently engaged in a bitter fight over mining scam in the maiden budget session of Captain   government.
 
 A battery of Congress MLAs from Punjab and Haryana were present at the meeting . However, senior ministers like Amarinder, finance minister Manpreet Badal and Navjot Singh Sidhu stayed away.
 
 When asked about it, Meira Kumar refused to call the preseidential election a Dalit versus Dalit fight. Both Meira Kumar and Kovind belong to the Dalit community.
 
 “I respect Kovind ji, my fight is not against him, but against his ideology,” she said.
 
 “Presidential elections have never in the past been contested on Dalit ideology. In fact, this is the first time that the election to the highest office of India is coloured with casteism and communalism which have been on the rise in the recent months,” she said.
 
 Punjab has 33% Dalits, the highest in the country. “The Dalit versus Dalit is a misnomer for this election,” she added.
