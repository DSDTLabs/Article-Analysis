KOLKATA: Even as the   remained 36.5Â°C on a dry and warm Sunday, the Met office predicted that Kolkata will be lashed by the season's first thundershower on Monday evening. It could be accompanied by gusty winds, making it a proper squall unlike the brief storm that hit the city early on February 26. 

 The mercury is also set to climb down a couple of notches following the thundershower, weathermen said. 
 
 An anticyclone system over   and a passing western disturbance have combined to create thunderclouds. "It will be accompanied by gusty winds making it the season's first squall. Under its impact, the temperature will drop marginally and Tuesday could remain cloudy," said H R Biswas, scientist at the Regional Meteorological Centre.
 
 Biswas said hot winds blowing in from west and central India have been pushing the mercury up. "Northerly winds have been replaced by dry, warm winds from the west and central parts of India where temperatures are high. This is normal at this time of the year. Unless we have thunderstorms, it will remain warm. But thunderstorms are rare in March. We may have more thundershower in April and May," said Biswas.
