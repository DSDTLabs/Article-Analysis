 Medical officer at the RMC, Kiran Kumar said, "Now fogging has been started in all the wards and a roster has been prepared by us, following which our vehicles will go from ward to ward on given dates."
 
 At present, there are two big and 11 small vehicles which are being used for fogging. While the big vehicles are reserved for major roads, smaller vehicles have been allotted to wards on specific dates.
 
 Kumar said, "As we have a limited number of vehicles, the roster has been prepared in such a way that one vehicle covers at least five wards in a day. On the first day, the RMC has covered wards 1 to 6."
 
 She added, "The plan is to finish fogging in all the wards at least once by Friday. Now every week we would cover each ward once and will give the vehicles a break on weekends, for servicing and maintenance."
 
 The contact numbers of zonal supervisors have also been issued by the RMC, so that people can call up and request for fogging in their wards if it is needed.
 
 Kumar also said, "If the mosquito menace is high in some areas and citizens want extra fogging, they can call up the zonal supervisor and request for a vehicle. If the vehicle is not sent, we will take action against the supervisors." 
 
 The RMC is also planning to provide fogging facilities to individual households and private colonies. 
 
 Kumar added, "These services will be charged. We are making an estimate of the expenses and it will be sent for approval in the next board meeting."
