BHOPAL: Chief minister   said there is an urgent need to monitor, curb misuse of social media and growing fundamentalism in the name of caste, colour and religion. Such divisive forces pose biggest challenge for police.

 “Social media is being misused. Many times you don’t know what wrong you have committed. When it goes viral on social media you come to know about it. Police come across such issues everyday. Later, you go clarifying it to everybody,” Chouhan said while inaugurating the twoday   (IPS) officers’ meet at   hall on Friday.
 
 Chouhan said police duty is not a service, but a 24x7 responsibility. Policemen face challenges day in and day out. They do not even get time to celebrate festivals with their family. Police need to be patient, optimistic and enthusiastic to win over confidence of public. There could be errors in the system, but MP Police is doing an excellent job, Chouhan said. He has a piece of advice for police officers. “We should be proud of the uniform and there should be no room for arrogance. Do not lose courage and be patient in difficult situations. I appreciate whatever was assigned to cops was performed and executed with courage and dedication. Whether it was anti-dacoit operation or action against   terrorists, all outlaws were eliminated. The service meet gives you a chance to de-stress,” said Chouhan. Cautioning against growing fundamentalism in name of caste and religion, the CM said, it is a matter of concern and efforts should be made to control and strike at its roots.
 
 Vidhan Sabha Speaker   raised issues of misuse of social media and right to information (RTI). Director general of police (DGP)   said police face criticism, insult, apathy, ignorance and mockery, but remain undeterred by setbacks. Efforts are necessary to boost the morale of the organisation.
