You said   govt took appropriate action after   rape, but we should remind you that congress lost power in Delhi because of their inaction after Nirbaya rape.   where were you when your party member   nagar MLA  's followers pulled the saree of a JDS lady corporator in public?
  
  Do you know this incident happened at the venue where your   CM was present. Is it true after the lady complained about the MLA, Muniratna threatened to finish her? Do you know Muniratna has previously also attacked your own congress women Corporator, there was a complaint against him by   that he was harassing women.
  Madam what action did your party take against your minister   who was caught in sex scandal with a woman. Your party president is a women, is she okay with such ministers?! Before talking about the country, it's better you talk about your own party. First provide security to women in your party later you can mock others. Central ministers wife ( ) was also not safe under your government, so country knows the contribution of Congress towards women security.You said BJP govt did not release money for farmers. But do you know there is official papers from   ministry which shows Karnataka government received 28,750 crores under devolution formula in 2016-17 from centre....where did all the money go madam?
  
  Madam, you speak very good English. But people in Karnataka don't understand your fake American accent!!!
