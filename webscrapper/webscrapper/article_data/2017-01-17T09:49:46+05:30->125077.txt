LUCKNOW: Stamp of no prominent BJP leader is visible in the first list of 149 candidates other than of Rajasthan governor and former UP chief minister  . Along with his grandson Sandeep Singh from Atrauli, five other leaders who have enjoyed proximity with the former CM have made it to the first list.

 Union minister for Ganga rejuvenation Jhansi MP   is known for being close to Kalyan and her   former MLC candidate Sanjay Sharma got a ticket from Anupshahar in Bulandshahar district. Sanjay was instrumental in the clean Ganga campaign for which Army was roped in.
 
 Kalyanâ€™s other associates, including Devendra Singh Lodhi from Syana, Ravindra Pal from Chharra, Devendra Singh Lodhi from Kasganj, Devendra Pratap Singh from Amanpur and Virendra Verma from Marhara, have all got the BJP ticket.
 
 With candidates for 254 seats yet to be decided, it would be interesting to see which other prominent leader is able to influence the list. Discussion on rest of the seats would be held on Tuesday.
