The life of iconic   student leader,  , who was stabbed to death in broad daylight on the university campus in 1972, is going to be retold on silver screen.   who made his debut with the critically acclaimed 2013 naxal drama, Dalam is directing the movie which is set to kickstart soon. “George Reddy believed in fighting to free India from the hands of imperialism and feudalism and left an indelible mark on student politics of India in the late ’60s and early ’70s before he was murdered. 

 The values of freedom that he espoused as he fearlessly waded into student politics and challenged the divisive ideologies of the fascist forces are very much relevant in contemporary India,” says Jeevan adding, “The film will showcase   Reddy not just as an individual but as a way of life. Despite coming from an upper caste he fought for the rights of the weaker sections and gender oppression and that is what made him an icon and an inspiration for many political leaders. I have been working on this script for a long time now and it will tell his life in complete detail.”
 
 Sandy, who acted in Ram Gopal Varma’s  , has been roped in to play George’s character. “  has been taking lessons in boxing for the last six months and has completely gotten into the skin of the character. From the way George used to walk, talk and behaved, Sandy has imbibed everything. In fact looking at him it will seem like George Reddy himself is on screen. We are planning to release the first look teaser of the film on August 15,” says Jeevan adding, “The film is going to be a Telugu-Hindi bilingual which will be made on a large scale. And two star heroes have agreed to make guest appearances as well.”
