It rained raags at   on Saturday evening. The sixth instalment of ‘Monsoon Nirvana’ brought together an eclectic line-up of artistes —  ,  ,  ,   and   — on one stage. The artistes performed both solo and collectively, offering a taste of different musical styles and made it memorable for music aficionados of the city.

 The concert opened with Saskia D Rao, who captured the pathos and devotion of the raag Charukesi on the cello. Presenting raag Antaravahini, city-based flautist Nagaraju created ripples with his mastery over the 
 instrument. He then brought to life the mood of evening raag Hamsadwani with subtle phoonks while the Netherlands-born Indian cellist weaved magic with the bow on the violoncello. 
 Next up was Chennai-based vocalist Sikkil Gurucharan, who took listeners on a mystical journey as he performed four songs in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. During his 
 rendition, the Carnatic vocalist touched upon the philosophies of life — the concept of pain, love, glee, grief and misery as preached by the poets Poonthanam Namboodiri, Annamacharya, Kanakadasar and Subramania Bharati.
 For his last rendition, Gurucharan was joined by acclaimed vocalist Sawani Shende of the Kirana and Gwalior gharana as she went on to entrance the audience with her vocal mastery. After displaying an impressive command over khayal on raag Miyan Malhar, she rendered a Kabir bhajan, sweeping the audience with a wave of devotional fervour. 
 Jazim Sharma took centre stage, rendering popular Punjabi Sufi songs such as Dama Dam Mast Qalandar, Aye Ri Sakhi More Piya Ghar Aaye and Chap Tilak, drawing countless waah waahs from the audience. The curtains came down with a soulful rendition of Punjabi Heer, which received a big round of applause from the audience. Amit Choubey on tabla and percussion, DSR Murthy on mridangam, Nirmal Pawar on dholak and Farooque Lateef on the sarangi ably accompanied the artistes with utmost discipline of lay, taal and melody.
