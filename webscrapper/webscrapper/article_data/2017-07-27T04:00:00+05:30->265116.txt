Surat: While the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is all set to launch the extension of BRTS service at the Surat airport starting from July 29, the We Work for a Working Airport at Surat (WWWAS) has demanded ‘airport express bus’ service to facilitate the passengers. 

 The members of WWWAS met the chairman of the transporation committee of the SMC, Anil Goplani on Wednesday and appraised him about the need for starting an airport express bus service to facilitate the passengers. The WWWAS members also demanded that the civic body should fix the priority routes from airport for the BRTS services.
 
 In the representation, the WWWAS members provided the BRTS routes including railway station via Ring Road to airport, Amroli-Katargam via Chowk to Airport, Sachin-Udhana via Udhana Magdalla to airport, Variav-Jehangirpura via Rander Road, Athwagate to Airport, Sarthana to Varacha via Parvat Patia to airport etc.
 
 Member of WWWAS Sanjay Jain said, “The BRTS service extension to airport was a long pending demand by our group. We are thankful to the civic chief for taking prompt decision to start the services. However, we have also urged the transportation committee chairman to start airport express bus service to facilitate the passengers.”
 
 Jain added, “The airport express bus is a specialized vehicle meant for the transportation between airport to city areas. The bus has a separate facility for the luggage storage. Such buses will go a long way in catering the passengers, especially those coming from other states.”
