MUMBAI:  , a   starring  , has generated much heat even before its release date is fixed. On Monday,   dragged the actor’s production house,  , to   against a “termination” of a deal. 

 The joint producers through their counsel, Birendra Saraf for Kriarj and Aspi Chinoy for Abraham, argued over business dues before Justice S J Kathawalla to ensure the film’s release next month. Kriarj said it would pay over Rs 5 crore due to Abraham by Friday, and Abraham’s firm would carry out the marketing and publicity for Rs 10 crore, which Kriarj is supposed to pay back.
 
 The matter was heard thrice in a day with intervals to work out if Kriarj could pay the Rs 10 crore it was meant to for marketing and other detail and finally was kept on Tuesday for the actor’s firm to give details of a “digital poster” and other marketing blueprint it intends to use. Saraf said his clients has “interests too which must be protected” as should interests of distributers, and questioned May 4 as the proposed release date as too brief a time for proper marketing for its success. 
 
 The judge asked Chinoy if release can be done by May 11.
