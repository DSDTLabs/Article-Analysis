Meerut: A 60-year old woman was hacked to death in Dattnagar village of Baghpat by robbers as they targeted four houses there late on Friday night. The victim, Sheela Devi, was the mother-in-law of the village pradhan Guddi Giri. According to villagers, close to a dozen armed robbers attacked four homes, including that of the pradhan. They decamped with loot worth Rs 5 lakh and killed Devi when she tried to resist. They also fired multiple rounds in the air, said the villagers. The village has still not got over the panic.    Baghpat superintendent of police (SP) Jai Prakash Singh said, "The incident occurred after Friday midnight. Soon after getting the news, a combined force of three police stations was rushed to the spot and a combing operation carried out but with no success. The village pradhan’s mother-in-law was also attacked with a sharp-edged weapon when she apparently resisted the loot. She succumbed to her injury. Forensic teams have reached the spot and investigations are on."    Joginder Giri, a member of the pradhan’s family, said, “Half the family was away when attack took place. I, along with my family was sleeping near the cowshed in our house when we heard some strange sounds. When I reached the courtyard, I saw mother lying in a pool of blood. Her throat had been slit with a sharp-edged weapon. The entire house had been ransacked.”    Munish Kumar, whose house was one of the four to be targeted, said, “It was around midnight that my wife felt someone touching her head. As she got up, the person snatched her gold earrings away. By the time we could realize what was happening, I saw the silhouettes of two men scaling the wall and escaping. Later, we realized our phones and Rs 10,000 had been looted.”
