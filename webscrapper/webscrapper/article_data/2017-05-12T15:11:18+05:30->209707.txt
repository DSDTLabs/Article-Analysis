 Pilibhit: Most of Pilibhit tiger reserve’s (PTR) beat watchers, the frontline workers, are unaware of the ex gratia plan of World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The plan envisages a one-time financial reparation of Rs 3 lakh to any person in case of death or permanent disability during the wildlife conservation duty.   The matter assumes significance in view of forest watcher Tara Chand’s death on Monday in PTR under mysterious circumstances. His family is eligible to a compensation under this plan. For some reason, PTR officials have not given proper publicity to WWF’s ex gratia plan.    Jaideep Bose, senior manager, species and landscape division of WWF (India), had apprised principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) of Uttar Pradesh Umendra Sharma through a letter dated November 4 last year about the financial assistance plan. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) for which had been signed with ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, he added.    Bose had also requested the PCCF to give wide publicity to WWF’s plan. However, when TOI spoke with many beat watchers deployed across PTR’s five forest ranges, none was aware about it.    According to Kheri district-based regional coordinator of WWF Mudit Gupta, the plan in question covers 15 states across the country, including UP. The plan had come into effect on November 1, 2016 for a period of three years, till October 31, 2019, Bose added.    On being asked conservator of forest VK Singh accepted the negligence on the part of PTR officials in publicizing the WWF’s plan. “It should have been an indispensable part of the DFO’s duty to manage the desired publicity of the plan as the responsibility of the security of the entire forest rests on the frontline forest force. He said he would look into the matter.
