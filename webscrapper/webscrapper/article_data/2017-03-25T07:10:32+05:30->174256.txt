NEW DELHI: In a report on “hate crimes“ submitted to the   on Friday , the law commission has recommended introducing more provisions in the   (IPC) and the   (CrPC) widening the definition of “ïncitement of violence“.

 The commission has recommended that efforts to cre ate hatred and fear should also be brought under the ambit of the law.
 
 “Even a speech that does not incite violence has the potential of marginalising a section of the society,“ the panel has said while seeking enhanced penal provisions to check hate crimes in the country .
 
 The panel has suggested that the government amend the IPC by adding a new provision on “prohibiting incitement to hatred“ following Section 153B of IPC and “causing fear, alarm, or provocation of violence in certain cases“ following section 505 of IPC, and accordingly amend the first schedule of the CrPC.
 
 The proposed new section 153 C of the IPC says: “Whoever on grounds of religion, race, caste or community , etc.uses gravely threatening words either spoken or written.. with the intention to cause, fear or alarm; or advocates hatred that causes incitement to violence shall be punishable with imprison ment of a term which may extend to two years, and fine of up to Rs 5,000, or both.“
 
 The insertion of new section after section 505 is for causing fear, alarm, or provocation of violence in certain cases. According to this section, “Whoever in public intentionally on grounds of religion, race, caste or community, etc. uses words, or displays any sign, or other visible representation which is gravely threatening, or derogatory , causing fear or alarm, or provoke the use of unlawful violence shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year andor fine up to Rs 5,000, or both“.
