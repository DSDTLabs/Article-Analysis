HYDERABAD: The water sharing dispute between   and Andhra Pradesh spilled into the southern states meet on Tuesday, exposing the fault lines in the   Reorganisation Act that divided Godavari and Krishna rivers between the two states. 

 During the meeting, Andhra Pradesh once again insisted on the announcement of jurisdiction of Krishna and Godavari river boards, which Telangana vehemently opposed. AP also voiced its concern over the Kaleshwaram project, which Telangana defended saying it is not a new project.
 
 Telangana demanded additional share in Krishna water, citing the diversion of Godavari water through   project. This infuriated Andhra Pradesh, which in turn raised the issue of new projects taken up by Telangana, including the   lift irrigation project.
 
 "Even now, AP has raised objection to Kaleshwaram project. Centre has already accepted the project as an old one, but AP is trying to make it an issue," said Harish Rao, Telangana irrigation minister.
 
 
 
 
 Telangana also raised the issue of submergence under Polavaram project and demanded a fresh study on it. Harish also pointed to a delay in addressing many complaints submitted by Telangana over water sharing and projectwise allocations.
 
 “The Krishna river tribunal has not finalised allocations in the last 14 years and it is still continuing its hearings,” said the minister.
 
 Andhra Pradesh irrigation minister D Umamaheswara Rao was conspicuous by his absence. AP’s arguments were presented by a senior official of the irrigation department.
