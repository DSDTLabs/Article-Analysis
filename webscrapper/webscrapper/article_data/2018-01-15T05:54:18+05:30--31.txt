BENGALURU: The forest department’s efforts to raise revenue without taking a toll on the environment seem to be bearing fruit. Revising the rates for services, some of which remained unchanged for several decades, has turned out to be lucrative for the department.

 By October, the department achieved 90% of the targeted revenue for 2017-18 from services like issuing permits, transit passes and renting equipment, which are bracketed under ‘other items’. The collection was Rs 48.91 crore against the target of Rs 53.84 crore.
 
 Brijesh Kumar Dikshit, additional principal chief conservator of forests (forest resource management), said adjusting for inflation was the logic behind the quantum of price revision. “67% of the department’s revenue comes from sale of timber through auctions; 3% from fixed allotment and its sale to only a few customers. The remaining 30% is from income accruing from fees, fines and goods and services rendered. We normally ignore this 30% and think of materialistic ways to enhance revenue, but a different perspective was needed to make money without harming the environment,”   said.
 
 “Some rates had been stagnant from the 1960s. We simply adjusted for inflation. Revenue from revising rates is relatively easier to collect as these are routine office works and environment friendly too,” said  , who as additional chief secretary of the forest department had effected the hike in service charges.
