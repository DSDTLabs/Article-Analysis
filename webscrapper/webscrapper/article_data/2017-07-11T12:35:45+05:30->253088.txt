PANAJI: Suggesting that Goa police was incapable of conducting an impartial probe into repeated desecration of religious structures in the state,   (GPCC) on Monday demanded that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) be brought in to probe the incidents. Newly-appointed   president   said that the party would write to Union minister for home affairs Rajnath Singh seeking a CBI probe.

 “No doubt our police is on the job, but some kind of pressure could also be put on the police and that is why a neutral probe by CBI is required. I demand a CBI inquiry in the desecration of religious places in Goa, whether they are of Hindus, Christians or Muslims. If this does not happen, then the communal peace of Goa will be shattered,” the outgoing Rajya Sabha member said.
 
 A Congress delegation led by Naik met with director general of police Mukhtesh   and urged him to conduct a proper inquiry into the desecration of crosses and a graveyard.
 
 Naik lashed out at chief minister Manohar Parrikar for not delegating the powers of the home ministry to his cabinet colleagues. “When a sensitive issue is at hand, to leave and not give charge is not appropriate. I condemn this. Internal politics is separate, if they don’t trust each other, that is not our concern,” he said. 
 
 Chander assured the Congress delegation that all possible measures were being taken to prevent these incidents as well as solve the cases and identify the miscreants.”
