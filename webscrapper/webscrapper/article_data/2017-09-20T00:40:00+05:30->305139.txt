Coimbatore: A 21-year-old man was arrested for repeatedly raping his 13-year-old cousin, who was a Class IX student of a government school, and making her pregnant here on Tuesday.

 The incident came to light after the girl was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) on Friday (September 15) with stomach pain. Doctors found that the girl was five-month pregnant. The minor delivered a stillborn baby on Tuesday and named her cousin N Indhiran, 21 of Govanur near Periyanaickenpalayam, responsible for her pregnancy.
 
 The girlâ€™s parents were daily wage labourers and she was alone at her house often, the police said. Indhiran used to visit her house frequently and raped her repeatedly a few months ago.
 
 Thudiyalur all-woman police subsequently registered a case under various sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and arrested N Indhiran, a driver. He was later remanded in judicial custody. Further investigation is on.
