NAGPUR: State government officers must create awareness among farmers about advanced agricultural techniques so that rural distress can be reduced.   should train officers to do this job, said chief minister   on Saturday. He was speaking at the inauguration function of   in Vanamati premises.

 “Vanamati trains government officers in fields of agriculture and public administration. At present, farm sector needs the highest degree of attention. Global warming is causing great difficulties for farmers and they must know ways to combat it,” the CM further said.
 
 According to Fadnavis, farmers must learn how to use weather information and do soil and water testing before choosing and planting crops. “If farmers are taught to do these things they will certainly benefit,” he said.
 
 Fadnavis further said that ex-CM Vasantrao Naik had done a commendable job in the fields of agriculture and water conservation. “However, his successors neglected water conservation, which caused great loss to farmers over the years. After a gap of several years, this government has launched Jalyukta Shivar project which has helped farmers greatly. In places where the project was implemented successfully, water level has come up to 5 metres. In Marathwada in spite of the drought water level has increased by 3 metres,” he added.
 
 Praising Naik, Fadnavis said, “The state needs water conservation more than dams. This fact was realized by Naik way back in 1960s and 1970s. Naik believed in making the state self sufficient in terms of foodgrains. It is a matter of great joy that a hall is being named after the great man.”
