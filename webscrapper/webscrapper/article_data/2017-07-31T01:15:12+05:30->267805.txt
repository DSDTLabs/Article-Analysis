NEW DELHI: With a little over three weeks left for the bypolls in the   constituency, former   legislator Guggan Singh   joined   on Sunday.

 Ranga, who won the 2013   elections as a BJP candidate from Bawana, left the party after it decided to field former AAP   Ved   from this seat. 
 
 Prakash, who quit AAP and joined BJP in March, had been in BJP till 2014. He had quit the party to join AAP just before the 2015 assembly elections.
 
 Upset over being displaced by Prakash, Ranga had also been trying to get a BSP ticket. However, AAP has already declared the name of a local volunteer as its candidate. 
 
 On Sunday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal presided over Ranga’s joining and addressed a jan sabha. 
 
 “People were not happy with Prakash. The party has been working extensively in the area since the day he quit and we are confident of a positive result,” said a source.
