AHMEDABAD: Kamaljeet Kaur, 56, was shocked when she began to shiver and a while later, passed   while urinating. She had just undergone a complete knee-replacement surgery at a   in Bopal last week and was on a recovery course in the ICU. The paramedic staff covered her with blankets, but that did not provide comfort. Her husband, Captain Baldev Singh, 60, now alleges that the hospital had administered blood from the  , AB Positive, after surgery, instead of her O Positive group. 

 “Kaur was operated upon on Friday morning and was taken to the ICU around 1pm. Later, she noticed blood in her urine bag. We saw that AB Positive blood group had been given to her, while her actual blood group was O Positive. The issue could have been critical,” said Captain Baldev Singh, while alleging blunder on part of the hospital paramedic staff.
 
 The hospital authorities only confirmed that the patient has been currently shifted from the ICU and is in a stable condition. “We have not ascertained anything yet. Inquiry is on. When we were informed of the patient’s  , we addressed the issue with due diligence,” said Dr Nishita Shukla, Cluster COO – Ahmedabad, of the private group of hospital.
 
 “On Monday, a five-member committee was also formed to probe the matter,” Shukla said. 
 
 “The committee will submit a report within two days, ending Wednesday. Once we have the report, necessary action will be taken. At present, the patient is recovering well at the hospital,” she added.
