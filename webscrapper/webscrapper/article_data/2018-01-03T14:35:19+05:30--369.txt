COIMBATORE: A day after a section of farmers held a sales introduction meet and distributed neera (sweet toddy) samples, officials on Tuesday asked them to stop distributing the samples as it was unlicensed.

 The state had lifted the ban on the drink extracted from coconut trees and issued a government order (GO) on December 21 stating it can be extracted and sold only by a registered company or cooperative of coconut farmers, that too after getting licence.
 
 The farmers, however, said they had just prepared samples of the drink to distribute it to the people and outlets to introduce it to them.
 
 An officer, who ordered an inquiry into the issue, said they have met members of  , who organised the neera introduction meet, and briefed them about the GO. 
 
 “We explained to them that distribution of neera samples without licence was illegal and asked them to approach the district collector to register their company and obtain a licence to extract and sell the drink,” the officer said.
 
 Following this, representatives of the farmers’ association petitioned the officials of the excise department and also urged the government to provide them with the capital required to set up a neera plant. 
 
 “Experts peg the cost to set up a neera plant at around Rs 3 crore. And farmers can’t afford that amount. We want the state government to bear the expenses,” said A S  , district secretary of the   Farmers’ Association.
 
 The farmers said if the government weren’t interested in setting up the plant, it should at least allow individual farmers to extract and sell neera. “This is a livelihood issue for farmers,” Babu added.
 
 An official attached to the excise department said he has guided the farmers through the procedures and asked them to fill in the forms as mentioned in the GO and submit them to obtain licence.
 
 Babu said they would submit the forms on Thursday to obtain licence to extract and sell neera.
