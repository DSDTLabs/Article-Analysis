BENGALURU: Thousands of students aspiring to be doctors sat for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for undergraduates on Sunday and while many found the physics part difficult, most said biology was a breeze.

 Students took the test at 187 centres across nine cities in the state, including Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mangaluru and Belagavi. For the first time, the test was held in centres at Dharwad.
 
 Maryam Sahana, who took the test at the Kendriya Vidyalaya School, Malleswaram, said, “I had prepared well, but the physics part was very difficult.”
 
 Arjun B, who took coaching classes to better prepare for the exam, said the paper was lengthy. “I think the paper was as tough as last year’s, but this year, physics was lengthy and some questions were tricky,” he said. “I had to skip a few of them. There were some direct questions from the NCERT text books in other sections. Time was not really a constraint though.”
 
 However, experts who analysed the questions revealed the test was harder than last year. Sridhar G, founder of Deeksha, the coaching chain, said, “While the biology part was on expected lines and primarily from the NCERT book with a few analytical questions thrown in, the real surprise was physics. Most of the questions were from the syllabus, but many had two or more concepts interlinked and over 55% of the paper was numerical making it time-consuming. A total score of 500 may be needed to secure a merit seat at any one of the medical colleges in Karnataka, while the cut-off mark is expected to be around 340.”
 
 H N Subramanyam, head of physics department at BASE, said, “About 45% of the questions in the physics segment were easy, 35% were moderate and 20% were difficult. There were more questions from Mechanics than from Thermal Physics and Waves from the first year. Questions were more equally distributed from the second year portion. On the whole the paper can be regarded as moderately tough.”
