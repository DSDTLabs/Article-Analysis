Kanyakumari: The kin of six Tamil Nadu   who have been detained in Iran from February have appealed to the state and Union governments to get them released and bring them home.

 The fishermen, M Elango, 45, his nephew J Sagaya Rens, 23, A Sagaya Ajay Anrin Anish, 23, and V Pelukis Prabhu alias Christy, 43, of Rajakkamangalam Thurai in Kanyakumari District, P Nivedhan, 19, of Periyathalai in Tirunelveli and S Brightman, 33, of Kooduthalai in Tuticorin district were working in Bahrain for one Mohammed Nasar.
 
 Elango’s wife Sahayaprincy Selva told TOI that her husband was working in that country for 10 years and was the captain of the fishing boat ‘Al Mukala’ that belonged to Nasar. “They went fishing on February 8 and were arrested by the Iran Coast Guard in the late hours of February 12, on charges of entering their territorial waters. 
 
 From then on they have been lodged in the Kish Island in Iran,” she said. Relatives said that they did not seek government intervention for more than two months as their employer who was in touch with the families here gave hope that their men would be rescued. TNN
