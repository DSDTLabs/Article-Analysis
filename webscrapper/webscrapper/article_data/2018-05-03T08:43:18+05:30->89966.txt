BENGALURU: Defending champions   have in the past scripted dramatic comebacks to make the playoffs. For history to repeat itself, they will need more than just skill and luck. With two wins from eight matches,   & Co are staring at an early exit but bowling coach   believes the show is far from over.

 
 The New Zealander, talking after Mumbai’s 14-runs loss to Royal Challengers Bangalore here, said: “We have six games left and we have to win all of them. Even if we win it might not be in our hands, depending on the other results. I still believe we have key players in our squad who can win us six games in a row. We have done it in the past, I believe that we can. We just have to take one game at a time. Motivation has never been a problem for us.”
