VADODARA: In an interim order, the industrial court on Tuesday asked   not to remove contractual   and refrain from changing the conditions of their contract. The hospital had terminated contract of around 200 workers last month.

 The contract workers had resorted to peaceful agitation outside the hospital after they were given termination orders. The Makarpura GIDC Employees’ Union, on behalf of the workers then approached the court seeking stay on the termination while the case of their pay hike and regularizing them is sub-judice.
 
 While staying the termination order of the hospital, the court observed that under the condition that the case of regularizing the workers is pending, even if the contractor changes, the current workers should be given first preference in job. “It is reasonable to pass an order that under the Industrial Disputes Act, the hospital and contractor do not remove the workers neither change conditions of their contract,” the court stated in its order.
 
 Other workers whose case of not regularizing their job is not pending have also been given  . The hospital and the contractor cannot remove them nor change the condition of their contract, the court ordered.
 
 Further hearing in the case has been scheduled for May 22.
 
 When TOI contacted the hospital management, they refused to comment on the issue by saying that the matter is sub-judice.
