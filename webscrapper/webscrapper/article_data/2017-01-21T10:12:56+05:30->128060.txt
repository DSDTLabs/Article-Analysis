NAGPUR: An unidentified biker stabbed a 58-year-old woman with a sharp knife a few metres away from her residence in   in Hudkeshwar on Thursday night. The woman, identified as  , received deep injuries in the stomach. Her family and police are clueless about the reason for the assault. 

 Local residents rushed a profusely bleeding Godbole to   (GMCH) where she is fighting for life at the Surgical Intensive Care Unit. Godbole is unable to give description of the assailant, probably in his 20s, as he had covered his face with a long scarf, said cops. 
 
 An offence of attempt to murder was registered under section 307 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the biker who, said cops, planned to kill Godbole as he did not take away any valuables, cash or mobile phone from her.
 
 The incident took place when Godbole, who works at a flour mill in  , was headed home. The masked biker came from behind and tried to get close to her. When a startled Godbole tried to avoid being hit, the miscreant got down from the bike and stabbed her with a knife before fleeing the spot. 
 
 Godbole’s husband Natthu, a security guard, was on duty when the incident took place. He told TOI, “Usually, I drop and pick up my wife from her workplace on my bicycle. Since I am unwell, I couldn’t ride double-seat and didn’t go to receive her on Thursday night. So, the woman owner of the flour mill dropped my wife at the corner of a lane near our home. The attack took place when she was walking towards home.” 
 
 The couple’s son Vasant and daughter-in-law Madhuri live in Tumsar in Bhandara district. “Vasant learnt about the attack when he called his mother but a local resident answered it and informed him about the incident,” said Natthu.
 
 It is learnt, Godbole had reprimanded some youths who used to sit in front of the flour mill and embarrassed girls coming there. One of the youths probably attacked her to avenge the insult. Cops are investigating the case from all angles.
