KOLKATA: A court here on Sunday sent to three days police custody BJP's   unit Vice President  , arrested for allegedly taking money from   candidates on the pretext of getting them jobs. 

 The judge at Bidhannagar court also rejected a bail plea moved by the defence counsel.
 
 Majumdar was arrested on Saturday after seven hours of intense grilling at the Bidhannagar North police station following a complaint by Arup Ratan Roy that he has taken Rs 7.20 lakh in two tranches promising to get jobs for SSC candidates by moving the Supreme Court.
 
 However, the Bharatiya Janata Party leader lashed out at Roy in the court premises, saying he was not a candidate at the TET examination. "Complainant himself is not an examinee of TET. This complaint is based on lies. The entire thing is a conspiracy," Majumdar told reporters. ians
