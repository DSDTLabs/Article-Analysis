BATHINDA: The   (PPCB) and district administration on Friday honoured 117 farmers from   for suitably managing paddy and wheat stubble instead of putting it on fire during the 2017-18 crop seasons. They were honoured during a function held at the   (CUP), Bathinda.

 Bathinda deputy commissioner   said a special campaign was launched to motivate farmers to not burn stubble and use alternative methods such as making fertilizer from the residue or to use it as part of cattle feed. “This way not only miles of agricultural land were saved from getting burnt, even the farmer-friendly insects were saved, thereby saving input cost of farming and raising farm income,” he said.
 
 Lakra said the credit for its success went to 117 hardworking farmers of the district who did their best to manage stubble. He said 15 farmers each of Rampura, Bathinda, Sangat, Phool and Nathana blocks, 22 farmers of Maur and 20 farmers of Talwandi Sabo block were honoured.
 
 CUP vice-chancellor   also addressed the gathering. Bathinda chief agriculture officer (CAO) Gurditta Singh Sidhu apprised farmers about straw management. The PPCB distributed free compostable bags to the farmers.
