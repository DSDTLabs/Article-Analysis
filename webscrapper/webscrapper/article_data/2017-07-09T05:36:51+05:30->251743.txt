AHMEDABAD: To protest the lynchings of innocent citizens by mobs under the pretext of cow protection, a protest was called for by ‘Gujarat Jan Andolan’, an alliance of 19 organisations, near   in the city.

 Despite the humidity and heat, the demonstration was attended by more than five hundred people, including industrial workers, trade union leaders, lawyers, human right activists, social workers, academicians and youths. Placards bearing messages such as ‘Not In My Name’, ‘Shed Hate Not Blood’, ‘Democracy Not Mobocracy’ and ‘Early Signs of Fascism’ were displayed. Addressing the gathering, the convener of Jan Sangharsh Manch, Nirjhari Sinha, called on the people to unite and fight against the fascist forces attacking minorities and dalits in the name of cow protection.
 
 Briefing the press, Rahul Sharma, the former IPS officer turned lawyer, said, “Human life does not have caste or religion. Lynching human beings in the name of religion or in the name of cow protection deserves to be condemned by all. This is the cause of all Indians, so I also supported it.”
 
 Pravin Mishra, a social activist and academician, emphasized the need for sustained protests to awaken people to shed hate and not blood. Noted lawyer and activist Girish Patel, academician   and former chief minister Suresh Mehta also participated in the protest.
