PUNE: The association of heads of secondary and  , Mumbai, has petitioned Maharashtra State   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Pune, to end the examinations before March 20 because of the   each passing year.

 The letter said the exams should start at 9am instead of 11am. “The mean temperature now is 40 degrees celsius and this will only increase as per reports by experts and no amount of fans and coolers are going to help. Hence, the board should take a decision keeping in mind the changes in climate,“ the letter added.
 
 Parents said children should not write exams in the afternoon heat. The state board conducts exams in the morning and the afternoon.In rural areas, many schools do not have fans or even electricity.
 
 Parent   said, “There is a need to change the timings. The exams should end by mid-March. Students get exhausted due to the heat and it affects their performance. Classrooms have just a fan where the teacher sits which is not enough. An audit is necessary to see if the school has basic facilities. Only then should it be declared a centre. Funds must go to rural schools for infrastructural upgrade.“
 
 Board chairman   said, “The academic year starts in midJune which cannot be advanced because May has extreme weather. Required teaching hours are needed and the curriculum is designed to cover all topics in this period. We cannot have exams at 9am because some students travel a long distance in public transport to reach the exam centre and may have to set out very early.“
 
 Mhamane said the teachers' organisations can send him solutions.
 
 “One option is to decrease the number of days in the preparatory leave we give between the exams. But if we cancel this for an exam of 40 marks, these very organisations will protest. We don't mind finishing off the exams on consecutive days but parents and these associations will have a problem,“ he added.
