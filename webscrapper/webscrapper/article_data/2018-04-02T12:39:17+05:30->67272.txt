Singer   said she is angry that she had to undergo a double mastectomy reconstruction and total   a few years ago.

  
  
 According to the reports, the 38-year-old singer spoke about her experience as she prepared to appear on a show.
 
 "I'm angry, I don't expect anyone to feel sorry for me, I don't talk about it with my family and friends as I don't want them to feel awkward," Heaton said.
 
 On her breast reconstruction, she said, "There is no feeling there, I feel so disconnected with them. I was offered counselling but I just didn't have time."
 
 Heaton, who shares children Faith, six, and  , four, with husband and business person  , had the procedures because of the cancer genes she carries. She said she is worried about how her daughter will cope if she is also a carrier. 
 
 "At some point Faith who is only six is going to have to face the decisions I did. I want her to realise I'm not ashamed of my body and she should never be ashamed of hers either," she said.
