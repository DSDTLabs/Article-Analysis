HYDERABAD: Bangladesh have shown a remarkable proclivity to implode in the second innings and it's a worrying fact for their batting coach  . The first Test against New Zealand in Wellington saw them score 160 for nine after having posted 5958 declared in the first innings. Here they face another daunting prospect of scoring 356 runs on the final day with seven wickets in hand.

 The Sri Lankan hoped   and Co learn their lessons fast. “The biggest concern for me is our second innings batting. We blow away quickly . In New Zealand, I was not worried about the first Test as we had to play with five batters. But we should have batted better than that in the second. Hopefully, the boys are learning,“ he said here on Sunday .
