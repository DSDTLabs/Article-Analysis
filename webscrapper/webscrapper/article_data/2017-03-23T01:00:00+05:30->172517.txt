 Balan, who sinks her teeth into her characters, plays a menacing brothel madam in Srijit Mukerji’s ' '. With a unibrow and grey lenses, the actress has ensured that her look in the film is unique and fits the character to the T. 

 Interestingly, Vidya admits that her look partially happened to come together by chance. She reveals, “On the first day of the shoot, the set was in shambles. There was a storm and some parts of the set started leaking. So, it was a stressful day for Srijit. When I reached the set, there was some issue with my lenses. There was some miscommunication between the costume department and production, and my entire box of lenses had got left behind. However, after much search, they found a spare pair of lenses and we decided to use them. It actually looked better than the lenses we had originally planned to use. So, it was by default that we zeroed in on the grey lenses you see me sporting in the film. I believe that everything happens for the best.”
