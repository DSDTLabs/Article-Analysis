KOLKATA: After   and a few other places in Tamil Nadu when police started evicting pro-Jallikattu protesters on Monday morning, the subject generated considerable reaction in the Tamil community in Kolkata.

 Singer   was all for  . “I am for keeping it the way it is because it is part of the tradition and culture. It is not a good thing to ban it. As long as the cruelty is regulated, I am OK with it.”
 
 According to   dancer Hemamalini Suresh, who has been based in Kolkata for 25 years, there is nothing wrong about the concept of Jallikattu in terms of sports. “But one has to ensure that there is no torture of the animals. Wherever it is held, there should be a body to monitor that no animals are injured or tortured when the sport is held.”
 
 Mridangam artiste Pt S Sekhar insisted that many politicians and even celebrities are supporting Jallikattu for the fear of a backlash if they say something otherwise. “But it is a fact that there is cruelty happening. Of course, cruelty towards animals happens elsewhere too. I have spoken to a few friends in Chennai. They are saying that if it has to take place, there should be such a scenario where animal exploitation is stopped. Strict laws have to be enforced. However, we also know that Indians like to circumvent laws,” Sekhar said.
 
 What then is the best way out? “For a couple of years, one can enforce laws to prevent cruelty. If people don’t follow the laws and cruelty is continued, the highest court will then have to step in and ban all sports where there is a direct cruelty on animals,” Sekhar offered.
 
 Social worker and Tamil film actor Padma Ray Bardhan, who has been based in Kolkata for three decades, too highlighted the cruelty issue. “Of course, torture is happening. I am sure the animals are feeling the pain. I don’t even like to watch these games. If at all Jallikattu should happen, there should be proper restrictions to avoid cruelty,” she said.
