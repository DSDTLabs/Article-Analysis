It turned into a ‘who can cheer louder’ contest between the fans of   and   when Team   visited   recently

 
 
 When Delhi boy Sidharth Malhotra came on stage, his fans chanted ‘I love you, Sidharth!’ Some girls even screamed ‘Sidharth, I’m here to your left, I’m to your right’, to grab the actor’s attention. Sidharth and Rakul Preet then danced to one of the songs of Aiyaary. Sidharth said, "Finally, I am in SRCC in  . I love you, DU. I love you, Delhi." Samiksha Saxena, an SRCC student, remarked, "Every celeb says, ‘I love you, Delhi’, but when Sidharth says it, you know that he means it. He didn’t just say DU, he said North Campus." And the girls had a few questions for Sidharth – "Are you single? Humara koi chance hai kya?" A girl in the crowd rued, "Hum log toh kab se bol rahe thay, par usne suna hi nahin!"

 When Manoj Bajpayee joined Sidharth and Rakul on stage, the crowd got divided into two – Sidharth’s fangirls and ‘Manoj sir, Bihar se hain hum bhi’ fanboys. A group in the crowd was shouting so loud that Manoj asked them, "Kahan se ho tum?" And when he got to know, Manoj said it out loud to the crowd, “Bihar. Yeh Bihar ke hain.” After a point, Manoj had to request the girls in the crowd to stop shouting Sidharth’s name. "Girls, yahan Sidharth ke alawa bhi bahut kuch ho raha hai." 
 He also recited a poem from Aiyaary for the crowd, which not many could hear because of the noise. As the actors were requesting boys to maintain discipline, Manoj spotted a girl who had climbed over a guy’s shoulders. "Ek ladki kisi ladke ke kandhe pe hai, uss ladke ki haalat kharab hai." Sidharth said, "Haalat kharaab nahi hai, sir. DU ke ladke bahut mehnati hain."
