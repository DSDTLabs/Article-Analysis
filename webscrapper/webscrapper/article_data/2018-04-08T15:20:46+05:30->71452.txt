Ramgarh: A class 10 school student of DAV public school in   was abducted from Bandu village of Gola block by unidentified men when he was on way his home. Police have filed an FIR in connection with the incident and launched massive search operation. They have recovered the boy’s abandoned scooter which he used to go school and trached his mobile phone to Madhya Pradesh.

 According to the police, the kidnappers waylaid the boy when he was driving his scooter while returning from school along the Chitarpur-Rajrappa temple road on Thursday. The vehicle was found abandoned at a forest near the temple. The boy’s father, Ashok Sao, a hotelier, lodged a complaint with Rajrappa police station on Friday, following which an FIR was registered.
 
 “We have begun tracking the boy’s mobile phone. It’s location shows that he is now in Madhya Pradesh. We are investigating from all possible angles. Since no ransom call has yet been received by the boy’s family, we have to probe other possibilities. Recently, some handbills were pasted allegedly by a naxal outfit in which the boy’s father had been threatened with dire consequences if he does not pay extortion money. This could also be a reason behind the abduction,” Sachida Prasad Singh, officer in-charge of Rajrappa police station said.
 
 “We also are looking into the possibilities of personal enmity or the boy has fled from home,” Singh added.
