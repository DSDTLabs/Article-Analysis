NOIDA: A group of   union members protested outside the office of assistant regional transport officer (ARTO) in Noida on Tuesday alleging that the transport department was resorting to harassment by seizing their vehicles and deliberately delaying the permit approval despite repeated requests. The   comes after ARTO (enforcement) S K Singh had seized five   buses plying on the Noida-Agra route on Monday from Sector 37.

 
 According to Singh, these buses were plying with an invalid ‘permit’ which was signed only by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), Agra and not RTA Ghaziabad, even though 72 kilometres of the road fell under Ghaziabad region. However,   alleged that despite repeated attempts to get a counter signature from the head of the RTA Ghaziabad on the permits, the same was not being done.
 
 Showing an order from the Allahabad high court, Sarfaraz Siddiqui, who owns a fleet of buses, said that legal formalities were “deliberately” not being completed by the transport officials despite the officials fee ruling in their favour.
 
 The   owners said, the   was “politically motivated” and owners who had got permit during the SP regime were being targeted. “There is pressure from the government on officials and hence they are resorting to such action,” said Siddiqui.
 
 On March 2018, the state transport tribunal had also ordered RTA Ghaziabad to counter sign on the 48 permits issued to different bus owners.
 
 Meanwhile, RTO (Ghaziabad) Ajay Tripathi, said, a meeting is slated on the issue on May 17, but till then, the buses would remain to be “illegal”.
