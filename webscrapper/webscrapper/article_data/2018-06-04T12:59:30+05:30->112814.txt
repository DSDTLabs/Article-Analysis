Actor   and writer-turned-director  , who previously worked together on critically-acclaimed films like ‘Nuvvu Naaku Nachav’ and ‘Malliswari’, are set to team up for a third film. While Trivikram had only penned the scripts for those films, this time, he is set to direct the film, says a source.

 Trivikram reportedly met Venky and pitched a storyline. Impressed with the theme, the 57-year-old actor asked the director to arrive with a bound script, which the director has already begun working on, sources suggested. If everything materialises, the film is likely to go on floors in January 2019. S Radha Krishna might be bankrolling this project under his banner Haarika and Hassine Creations.
 
 Meanwhile, Venkatesh has signed Anil Ravipudi’s ‘F2: Fun and Frustration’, and KS Ravindra’s multi-starrer film also featuring Naga Chaitanya. According to the source, the untitled project with Chai will commence sometime in November 2018, after Venky wraps up ‘F2’: Fun and Frustration’.
