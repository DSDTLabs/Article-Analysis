KOLKATA: A fire broke out on the fourth floor of the   located opposite the Kolkata Police headquarters in   and a few metres away from a fire station on Wednesday morning. 

 
 According to fire department officers, a short-circuit in an AC triggered the blaze but the   can only be ascertained after a forensic examination. 
 
 Though the extent of damage was limited to a few office premises, the impunity with which the offices have been operating by flouting   right under the nose of the authorities, has raised several eyebrows.
 
 Around 9am, people inside the building noticed smoke coming out of room number 40, which houses the office of a stock broker. In a few minutes the entire facade of the building was covered in black smoke. 
 
 "Our men used breathing apparatus to enter the building and locate the origin of the blaze. It seems that a short circuit in an AC caused the fire," an officer said.
 
 This is not the first time a fire has broken out inside the   building, which has more than 30 offices located inside it. According to figures provided by the fire department there have been at least four blazes in the building since 2010 and almost all of them have been due to electrical short-circuit. 
 
 Even on Wednesday, the fire officers found the electrical wiring in a mess. "Most electrical fires occur due to faulty wiring or lack of maintenance," the officer said.
 
 An estate manager in the building, however, said the management carries out safety audit of the building from time to time.
