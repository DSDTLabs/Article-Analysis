Nagpur: An ‘artificial limb’ tickled a funny bone on the social media and also helped orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sushrut Babhulkar earn massive respect on Saturday.

 The doctor’s plans to implant an artificial limb on male tiger ‘Sahebrao’ has garnered him a lot of fans across the country. While some called him a Good Samaritan, others drew a funny parallel between tiger’s limping state and India’s current financial scenario.
 
 “These artificial limbs will be taxed, says Jaitley,” wrote Ivan Bigger, who clearly wasn’t happy with the Budget. “This tiger, our national animal, seems to be representing the condition of our country under BJP. The economy is limping but our great orthopaedic surgeon Jaitley has no clue,” wrote Jazz. “Believe the tiger not covered under new insurance of Rs5 lakh rolled out in the Budget,” wrote Vidyanand Padmaprabhu.
 
 The surgeon’s deeds also helped painting a good picture of the entire doctor fraternity. “Not all doctors care for money, good job!” said Gundchedilaal Parose. “Keep it up doctor. It is an optimum utilization of knowledge and degree,” wrote Mumbai’s Rahul Bandi. “This surgeon is none other than the Lord himself,” wrote another one. “This is a great news! The tiger may not express about the kindness of doctors. Kudos to doctors who worked on this,” wrote Delhi’s Ishaan.
 
 A section of tiger sympathizers also expressed their anger towards the poachers because of who the eight-year-old Sahebrao had got severely injured after being caught in a steel trap in 2012. “These poachers need to be amputated so that they can never poach again in their lifetime,” wrote Debasish Sarkar. “Tiger poaching is a grave problem and unless poachers are hanged publicly the problem will persist,” opined Kupamanduka.
