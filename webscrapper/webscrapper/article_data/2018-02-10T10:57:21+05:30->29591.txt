 The January 22 circular issued by   ( ) directed colleges to inform parents about the new rules and consequences of question-paper leaks.
 
 The DPUE will implement the amendment to the Karnataka Education Act, 1983, in which even the buyer of a leaked paper will have to pay up to Rs 5 lakh penalty and face a five-year jail.
 
  DPUE director C   told TOI : "Earlier, question-paper leak wasn't clearly defined. The amended Karnataka Education Act changes it. Even transfer of question paper through social media amounts to leakage," she added. 
 
 The changes were made after March 21, 2016, when the chemistry exam question paper was leaked repeatedly, inconveniencing nearly 2 lakh students. 
 
 The director said DPUE was committed to conducting secure examination as per the system followed last year. All second-year PU examination centres are installed with   cameras to check malpractices. "We will follow the same procedure this year too," she said.
