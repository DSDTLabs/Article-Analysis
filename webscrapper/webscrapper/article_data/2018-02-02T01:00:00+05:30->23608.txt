Pt Vishwa Mohan Bhatt is fascinated with the Padmaavat song, Ghoomar. “Aesthetically and artistically, it is so beautiful. Everyone appreciated it, even abroad. In my concerts, people request, ‘Thoda   bajaiye’,” Panditji told us, on the sidelines of Ek Mulakat. Overwhelmed by the making of the song, Panditji, who hails from Jaipur, wants the state government to make the film tax free. “I am from   and I am aware of the state’s cultural heritage. If   or Odisha were shown with such grandeur, I am sure they would have made it tax free,” said Panditji.

  But protests are still on to stop the screening of the film. “The film has released and I am sure representatives of   have watched it. Now I demand they take a side. The ball is in their court. Either they should point out how the film has hurt their sentiments or they should say that they are okay with the content. Ek clear decision ana chahiye. As per the report, there is nothing to offend. Unke aan baan shaan ko kuch aanch nahi aya. Now, if Karni Sena is okay with the film, my demand stands. I want the state to make it tax free. Humara Rajasthan ka bhi to kuch farz hai ki hum unko de. Bollywoodwale ko bhi kya padi hai ke woh Rajasthan ko itni khubsoorti se dikhayega?” Panditji questioned.
 
  He also said that he has full faith in  . “He is an artiste and a mature one. He is not an irresponsible person. He is sensible, I know him well. He will never hurt anyone’s sentiment.”
