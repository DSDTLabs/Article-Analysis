In most of his movies, actor   has banked on his chiselled physique to play his characters. 

 However, for the upcoming film Diwanji Moola Grand Prix, Rajeev will be sporting a different look to play a regular guy. The film, directed by Anil Radhakrishnan Menon, has Kunchacko Boban in the lead.
 
 Rajeev says, “All I can say about the role is that it’s going to be one of the most challenging and different characters I have tried so far. I play a regular youth that you would come across anywhere and won’t give a second look.”
 
 When asked if he is gearing up for a makeover, the actor says, “Yes. I am asked to tweak my look, but again, I can’t say much about it. I am also asked by the director to train on a few other aspects of my personality so that I don’t look out of place while playing the character.”
 Interestingly, Rajeev, who was last seen in  , doesn’t consider changing his looks to be a ‘lot of work’. “Well, I have been on a strict diet and workout for many years together and my body understands the transformation I am looking for easily now. Say, to lose 15kg, all I would need is around 20 days. It isn’t tough for anyone if they have been following a disciplined regime,” he says.
