 Ansari himself reached the PMCH nearby with blood all over his body for treatment. He subsequently informed his family.
 
 Pirbahore police   Mohd Qaiser Alam said police were yet to record the victim’s statement. “He is in a critical condition,” the SHO said on Saturday.
 
 The police officer said Ansari had a rent-related dispute with the shop owner, Shakuntala Devi (62), and her son. The matter is sub-judice in a sub-divisional court in Patna.
 
 Ansari’s son Mohd Rasul, who later took his father to a private hospital, said Shakuntala’s son Deepu Kumar had earlier threatened them with murder if they did not vacate the shop which they had taken on rent in 2004. The matter is pending in a court for around a year, he said.
