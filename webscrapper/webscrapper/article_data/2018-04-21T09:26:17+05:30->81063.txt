JALANDHAR:   Hot-Mix Plant Owners’ Association said on Friday that the state government had kept “impractical” conditions for repairing link roads and they would boycott the auction for allotment of works. 

 The state government has kept a Rs 1,700-crore budget for laying the link roads. Association leaders said senior officials of the state government were keeping old specifications, even as heavy traffic had increased manifold.
 
 Addressing a press conference here on Friday, association president   and other office-bearers said the rates being offered also did not match with the work that is to be carried out. “These projects are unviable for us,” he said.
 
 They said putting the condition of ‘sensor paver’ (which keeps the surface of roads smooth) on link roads was ridiculous, as this could be used only on wider roads which have a central verge. “Link roads are just 10 foot wide at several places and curved,” he said. “The sensor paver can simply not be used while making these roads; this factor alone exposes that the top policy maker who took decisions on these issues in the state government was detached from reality,” he said.
