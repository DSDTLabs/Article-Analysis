Nagpur: ‘Restriction in fetal growth’ has always been a challenge for obstetricians with 10% of   women being affected by it. 

 Mumbai-based noted radiologist Dr Nitin Chaubal said, “Earlier, the condition was associated with malnourished mothers. However, a change is observed nowadays. Apart from malnourished expectant mothers, we are encountering this condition in over-nourished mothers and women leading stressful life.” 
 
 Dr Chaubal was speaking at the CME organized by New Nagpur Test Tube Baby Center and Dr Ketkar Hospital in coordination with Nagpur   and Gynaecology Society (NOGS). 
 
 The CME was organized by gynaecologist Dr Sadhana Deshmukh and Dr Mangala Ketkar. Chaubal, Fernandez Hospital (Hyderabad) obstretics department head Dr Nuzhat Aziz, NOGS president Dr Chaitanya Shembekar, secretary Dr Warsha Dheole were also present on the dais.
 
 Chaubal said, “Our centre operating in posh south Bombay area of Mumbai, we get to see a lot of over-nourished women having ‘restriction in fetal growth’ condition.”
 
 Aziz said, “Nutrition plays important role in having smaller babies. It is difficult for the women from poor strata to get proper nutrition as many of them have to survive on just dal and rice throughout pregnancy. In such a situation, the possibility of the baby having some morbidity or mental illness increases.”
 
 He stressed on the need to have India-specific guidelines to prevent such condition. “The guidelines that are followed in Spain are being prescribed in India, which are, in fact, not suited to Indian women,” he said.
 
 During the ceremony, Deshmukh announced that the NTTBC has recently received Indian Society for Assisted Reproduction (ISAR) accreditation.
