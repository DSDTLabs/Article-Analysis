MUMBAI: Even after spending time behind bars for allegedly stealing a wallet from actor Karisma Kapoor’s Khar residence last year, a   from Kurla, Imtiaz Ansari (37), went back to his old ways. 

 Recently, two complaints were filed against Ansari for allegedly stealing valuables collectively worth Rs 16 lakh from the   residences of a businessman and a celebrity. Juhu police got Ansari’s number and an informant called him up pretending he urgently wanted some carpentry work done in his house. When Ansari said he could not come for a week, police realized he wasn’t in Mumbai. A team went to his home town in Uttar Pradesh and arrested him. He was brought to Mumbai on Tuesday. 
 
 Explaining his modus operandi, police said Ansari would make calls on the landline number of people living in the western suburbs asking if they needed the services of a carpenter. He would offer to do small jobs like fixing a door handle or a broken latch, which other carpenters usually avoid as it does not pay much. When a houseowner would call him over, Ansari would examine the work and say he had to buy some items like nails. He would take Rs 200-Rs 500 from the houseowner and leave to buy the items. On his return, the houseowner would be assured of his honesty, said police. 
 
 While doing the carpentry work, when the houseowner would not be looking, Ansari would pocket whatever he would lay his hands on. “If the owner kept a watch on him, Ansari would claim that the entrance door wasn’t functioning properly and should be tested from the outside. Once the owner stepped out to check the door, Ansari would steal valuables,” said assistant inspector Rahul Deshmukh. And, if anyone asked for a reference, he would provide the addresses of flats where he could not steal anything, police said.
 
 Ansari has at least 18 similar cases registered against him at police stations in Khar, Amboli, Bandra, Borivli, Juhu, Santacruz, Versova and Vile Parle.
