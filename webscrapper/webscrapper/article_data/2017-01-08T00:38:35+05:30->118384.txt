  Time management is the key to balance. Once I’m out of the work place, I strive to focus strictly on my personal life. Spending time with friends and dedicated ‘me’ time are what keeps me in balance.
  
  
 
  I’m not a fitness freak but I believe being healthy is important. Exercising regularly and keeping a strict watch on what is cooked in my kitchen are the key for keeping myself fit. Although, having a foodie husband makes this a daily struggle!
  
  
 
  I love the festive season. Feeding my friends and family and pampering them puts a big smile on my face. Seeing them around me give me joy.
  
  
 
  It depends on the situation. I believe in planning well, setting goals and achieving them and taking calculated risks.
  
  
 
  Yoga in the morning and deep meditation during the day helps me a lot. Giving myself time to live, laugh and love. Do good and do the right thing.
  
  
 
  There is a lesson in every failure and the joy of success comes from overcoming obstacles. The challenge is to keep putting one foot in front of the other.
  
  
 
  Always stay calm. Evaluate the situation and focus on the core issues. Think of a quick fix followed by a more proactive sustainable solution. Be level headed while dealing with a crisis.
  
  
 
  Films are the best escape for me. My aim is to keep stress to the minimum by pre-planning work. I try to stick to a planned schedule and always keep time for emergencies.
