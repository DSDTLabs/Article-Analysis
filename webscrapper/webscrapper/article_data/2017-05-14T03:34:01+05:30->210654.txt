AHMEDABAD: With   reducing supply to the state,   (GUVNL) has turned to the open market to   to deal with the shortage. The apex power utility has been purchasing roughly 15 million units (MUs) or 625MW daily from power exchanges to ensure uninterrupted power to consumers in the state.

 GUVNL bought 79 million units (approximately 3,200MW) from power exchanges from May 8 to May 12, while the figure stood at 83 MUs (3,458MW) in the first week of May. According to government officials, Gujarat is receiving curtailed supply from Adani Power Limited (APL),   (EPGL), and Tata group’s   (CGPL), which provide electricity to GUVNL under long-term power purchase agreements.
 
 “On a daily basis, GUVNL is facing a shortfall in the APL supply to the extent of 24 MUs to 30 MUs,” said a senior official of GUVNL. “On an average, 15 MUs are being procured from the open market and the rest from state-run power plants. Earlier, GUVNL was not buying as much power from the open market.”
 
 Although power supply from Tata Power and Essar Power Gujarat has been curtailed on technical grounds, APL has discontinued 1,250MW of power supply saying that expensive Indonesian coal was becoming unviable for the company, said sources privy to the development.
