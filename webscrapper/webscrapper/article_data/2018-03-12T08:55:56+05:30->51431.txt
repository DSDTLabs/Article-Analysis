MUMBAI: Vishwanath Bagare (77) and Mirabai Mohan Badade (60) are among the thousands of farmers who have been walking barefoot for five days from   to reach   in Mumbai. Bagare and Mirabai, who hail from Varkheda and Korat villages in Nashik district respectively, maintained that they will not go home till their demands are not met.

 Bagare’s 38-year-old son Somnath had committed suicide by consuming poison in 2011, as he was unable to repay the Rs 1.5 lakh loan taken in 2008. Bagare told TOI: “I have 2 acres of farm land. After my son’s death, my daughter-in-law went to her parents’ home, leaving behind her two sons and two daughters. I am finding it difficult to take care of them. In addition, the state is ignoring our demand of unconditional loan waiver.” As Bagare is yet to clear to clear the interest on the Rs 1.5 lakh, he is ineligible to get benefit of the   scheme. 
 
 Mirabai, who has two daughters and a son, claims she has been farming on two acres of forest land in her village. She wants ownership of the land. Her husband works as a labourer in another district. Transfer of forest land to tillers is one of the demands made by the protesting farmers. “I won’t return home unless my demand is fulfilled,” said Mirabai.
 
 Minimal   snarls were reported on Sunday as farmers marched from Mulund to Sion along the service road of Eastern Express Highway. “We had issued diversions to ensure there was no congestion,” said a traffic police officer. Citizens tweeted that they wouldn’t mind braving traffic for farmers to get their demands heard. “I got stuck in traffic at Mulund... I found people serving food and water to the farmers. The heat was too much,” tweeted Rajen Nair.
