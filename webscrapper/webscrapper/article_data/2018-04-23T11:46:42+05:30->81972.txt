India's heartthrob   is all set to let go of his single status today and plunge into marital bliss as he ties the knot with his ladylove 
 .

 According to Bombay Times, even though the ceremony is expected to be a private one, Milind and Ankita might have a reception abroad.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 As per the report, the ' ' guy wanted to keep is   low-key and hence only a selected group of friends and family have been invited. In fact, most of the guest gathered in   yesterday. Model-actress Dipannita Sharma, who is among the guests at the wedding, told BT on Saturday, “The mehndi was a lot of fun, with Assamese, Hindi and Marathi songs being played in the background. Everybody, including the couple, had a great time dancing.”
 
 Dipannita added, “Even the decor was a mix of Assamese and Marathi cultures. The wedding will also be a blend of both cultures, as Ankita is from Assam and Milind is a Maharashtrian. They want to keep it simple. We can’t wait to see them married.”
