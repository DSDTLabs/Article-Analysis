Veteran producer   is turning actor for the first time in his decades-long career in films, with Dileep-starrer  . Ask him how it feels to be in front of the camera and he says, 'I was full of apprehensions when its scriptwriter Sachy sounded the idea to me. I had never been interested in acting though I have been in the industry for long. I took it as a joke but he took it seriously. However, after a few scenes in the set, I fell into the groove.' Suresh plays a politician in the movie, a Congress president named Sagar Nagampadam. 'It's a somewhat important character in the film. I completed five days and have a few more days left. I hope I don't get hooted (laughs),' he signs off.
