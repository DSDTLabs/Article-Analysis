Kamal Bali, chairman,  , while insisting that farmers’ issues must be uppermost, claimed bandhs only dent the image of Brand Bengaluru and that there are other better ways to sort out issues. His thoughts were echoed by K  , president of  .

 
 “We are disappointed with the bandh,” Bali said of Thursday’s bandh. “The idea of the government working hard to ensure ease of business when there is so much competition between states, takes a hit. It is a big negative and results in huge loss to business and commerce.
 
 Bali said most people are unaware of why the bandh is called. “It is sad the kind of ordeal people have to go through. About 80% of the people in the city do not know what the real issue is. The government and citizens need to work together in a planned way and for the long term.
 
 
 “Farmers’ interests are most important as we still are an agrarian economy. The government needs to build a proper irrigation system, link rivers, and form committees to sort out issues. If not, you will have agrarian stress every now and then.”
 
 
 Ravi believes bandhs will only drive investors away. “With bandhs, image loss is more substantial than business loss. Further investments take a beating as investors will think it is an unsafe place. The global image of the city is high and if that is affected, the loss can’t be quantified.”
