Action star Liam   said he did not want his son   to join films. Reportedly, the 65-year-old actor says despite his own successful   career, he was originally against the idea of his 22-year-old son following in his footsteps, as he wanted to save him from rejection.

  
  
 "I tried to talk him out of it. The profession is all about rejection, you know? You go out for this part and you're rejected, and you're not rejected because of your education, you're rejected because of this."
 
 "The space you occupy. You're too tall. You're too Irish. Your nose is too broken. You're too this, you're too that. So it's - you want to save your kids from all that, you know?" Neeson said. However, the father-son duo recently worked together on thriller movie ' ', and Neeson said it was nice to act alongside his boy. 
 
 "We did a film earlier this year called 'Hard Powder'. It's a thriller. It's got a dark comedic bend to it, as well. He plays my son, and he's, it was good to act with (him)! We had two or three little scenes together and it was nice."
