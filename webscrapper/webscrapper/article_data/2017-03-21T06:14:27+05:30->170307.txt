LUCKNOW: A day after   was sworn in as 21st   of Uttar Pradesh, a ‘shuddhikaran (purification) puja’ was held at his official residence, 5 Kalidas Marg and there was ‘grah pravesh (housewarming)’ by the chief minister later in the evening on Monday. He visited the   for only 15 minutes, after meeting state government officials at Lok Bhawan. 

 “Maharaj ji bhog vilas se door hain, woh saada jeevan jeetein hain, isliye jo bhi taamsi aur rajsi vatavaran tha usse shuddhikaran puja se door kiya gaya (Yogi abstains from luxury and leads a simple life, hence the place needs to be cleansed of the environment of indulgence through rituals),” said Praveen Shastri, one of the five purohits, who came from Gorakhpur for the ceremony. 
 
 Led by Pandit Ramanujam Tripathi, the purohits were from Gorakshnath Sanskriti Mahavidyalaya and performed puja from 11am to 12.30pm. The mahurat (auspicious moment) for entering the new house was any time after 11am, Shastri told TOI, adding that initially, there was information that the chief minister would be arriving around 1pm, but couldn’t make it as he was busy in meetings with deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dr Dinesh Sharma and cabinet ministers Dharmpal Singh, besides with chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar, DGP Javeed Ahmed and principal secretaries Home and Information, Debashish Panda and Navneet Sehgal, respectively, at VVIP Guest House. 
 
 The purohit shared with TOI that Yogi will continue with his routine of feeding cows before his breakfast, though it was not confirmed whether cows would be bred at the CM’s residence or not. 
 
 Almost all the doors at the CM's residence now bear the Swastika symbol or have ‘Shubh Laabh’ written on them, including the main gate, said Shastri, adding that ‘vaastu yantra’ was installed and vastu puja performed to rid the premises of evil and negative vibes. 
 
 No date has been fixed so far though there is speculation that the CM would shift into the residence by March 28.
