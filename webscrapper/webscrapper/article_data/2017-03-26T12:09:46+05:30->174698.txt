GAYA: Magadh University’s officiating   on Friday evening ordered registration of an FIR against a student leader who allegedly posted a fake communique of the university's examination department on the social media regarding commencement of degree part III exam from April 21.
 
  VC-designate  , who was recently appointed by the chancellor, is yet to assume charge. He is likely to join on Monday.
  
  The communique went viral. The alleged author of the fake communique is also said to have forged the signature of Sushil Kumar Singh, former controller of exams under whose seal the communique was posted.
  
  The communique caused a flutter in the MU circles as the word also spread that the outgoing VC had sacked N K Yadav and reinstated Singh as the controller of exams. VC Kusum Kumari was flooded with queries about the justification for making such an important change in violation of the chancellor's order to perform only routine functions till the new VC took over.
  
  Talking to this correspondent on Saturday, the officiating VC denied having effected any change in the university's exam department. Asked about the communique issued in the seal of Singh, she said it was fake and Yadav continued to be the exam controller.
  
  “I have directed the controller of exam to lodge an FIR in this connection. A report will also be sent to the chancellor's office,’ she added.
  
   , who is alleged to have posted the fake communique, has since tendered an apology on the same social networking site.
