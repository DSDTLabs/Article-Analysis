THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The police team probing the murder of former radio jockey   at   has initiated proceedings for extradition of two prime suspects, who are currently in Qatar. Police suspect that   Bin Jalal alias Alibhai and his employer Abdul Sathar, had given the contract to kill Rajesh.

 Police sources said that they have already forwarded a letter in this regard to the home department.
 
 Sathar, in an interview given to a Qatar-based radio, had claimed that he had a travel ban owing to debts he incurred in his business. The police said that once the extradition process was through, this travel ban would not be a problem.
 
 The police theory is that Salih Bin Jalal, came to India through Nepal and executed the murder of Rajesh with the help of his friends here. He then returned to Qatar in the same route.
 
 Meanwhile on Friday, the police took two more persons into custody in connection with the incident. They were reportedly taken into custody from Mankulam in   district on Friday afternoon.
 
 Sources said that the two were part of the conspiracy of the crime. They were part of the WhatsApp group   in which the prime suspects were also members. However, the police refrained from revealing their actual role in the crime.
 
 On Thursday, the police had arrested the admin of the group B   for providing them accommodation and being part of the conspiracy.
 
 “This Whatsapp group members had a major role in aiding the crime. While Sanu arranged a safe stay, some others helped them in procuring weapons and a few others got the rental car,” the officer said.
 
 The woman dancer, with whom Rajesh allegedly had an affair, told a   radio station in Qatar that she didn’t believe her estranged husband Abdul Sathar would give a quotation to kill Rajesh. She also said the other suspect Salih was in Qatar when the crime was committed. The police are probing the motive of her statements, said sources.
