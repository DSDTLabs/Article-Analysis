 Bengaluru: Subham G, 42, is a regular at Cubbon Park. A fitness freak, the techie ensures he never compromises on his strict exercise regimen. While Subham is neither diabetic nor hypertensive, he suffered a debilitating stroke a few months ago. While his family was in shock, doctors blamed lack of sleep. Though he’s stable now, doctors have advised him not to use bright LED lights, especially the blue ones.
 
 Like Subham, doctors are seeing an increasing number of Bengalureans in the age group of 35-50 suffering from sleeplessness. Dr Arti Singh, cosmetologist and founder of Sparha Wellness Studio, said: “Apart from having puffy eyes, dry skin, fine lines and dark circles under the eyes, those with insomnia are more susceptible to heart ailments, high blood pressure, stroke and diabetes. Sleeplessness also leads to psychological problems, due to extreme stress. Cortisol, a stress hormone, breaks down collagen, the protein which keeps our skin elastic and smooth.”
 
 “Insomnia may be primary or a result of organic and psychological reasons. Organic causes include hepatic, renal, cardiac and neurological disorders,” said Dr Sujit Kumar, senior consultant and neurophysician at Apollo Hospital. He added: “Various body systems require sleep for a restorative and rejuvenating effect on them. It’s also vital for normal functioning of the heart, blood vessels, brain and endocrine organs.”
 
 Consumption of caffeine, nicotine and alcohol, and disorders like sleep apnoea (in which the patient has breathing trouble) also lead to sleeplessness. Doctors say in the case of pregnant women, gestational diabetes is the culprit.
 
 Dr Arti’s prescription — regular exercise, a comfortable bed, saying no to caffeine, alcohol and cigarettes, taking a shower before sleep, and avoiding bright LED lights and mobile phones. “Sometimes, medications also lead to loss of sleep,” she said. 
 
 The fallouts: Lack of concentration, stress 
 
 Sleeplessness comes with many repercussions — stress, depression, anxiety, lack of concentration, poor decision-making and dull performance at the workplace, say doctors.
 
 Dr L Sreenivasa Murthy, medical director, Nightingales Home Health Services, said: “Sleeping trouble leads to psychological problems. Chronic insomnia may increase an individual’s risk of developing mood disorders. Insomniacs are five times more likely to slip into depression and 20 times more likely to get panic disorders...Fatigue due to lack of sleep can cause headaches, resulting in poor performance at the workplace. This in turn results in irritation and the inability to concentrate,” he added.
 
 Dr Shantanu Tandon, ENT and sleep apnoea specialist at Sakra World Hospital, said: “Insomnia also affects personal relationships as it is known to lower testosterone that affects sex drive. Sleep apnoea can also cause erectile dysfunction”.
 
 Boxes: At the receiving end
 
 Vaishnavi S, 36, used to work the night shift till she was diagnosed with mood disorder, stress and depression due to lack of sleep. The corporate employee was always irritated and her mood swings distanced her from her husband and son. 
 
 A 33-year-old new mom suffered from acute depression due to lack of adequate sleep at night. She was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy. She would often ignore her baby and lock herself in a room. Now, she attends weekly counselling sessions.
 
 Big chunk of corporate employees affected
 
 About 30% to 50% of corporate employees working night shifts suffer from sleep disorders since they don’t get adequate rest. The routine interferes with the body’s natural sleep cycle
