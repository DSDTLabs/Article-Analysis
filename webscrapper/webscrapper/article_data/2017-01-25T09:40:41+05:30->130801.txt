NEW DELHI: A gang of snatchers had no idea that targeting Ritu, Rashi and Sheetal — three hockey champions from a Delhi University college — would prove to be a costly affair. The three girls chased the two criminals for nearly a kilometre, caught one of them and thrashed him until he handed over the snatched mobile phone. A policeman passing by arrested the snatcher.

 The incident was reported on January 20 when the three girls were going to Peeragarhi in a   they had boarded at Punjabi Bagh. “There were no other passengers except the two youths and us. When we reached Madipur, I got up to buy tickets from the conductor. One of the youths then came near Rashi and snatched her phone,” said Ritu.
 
 At the time, the bus had stopped at Madipur and the snatchers jumped off. “Before we could react, the driver shut the gates. When we asked him to open it, he said the bus will only stop at the next stand,” Ritu said.
 
 The girls got off at the next stand and walked back to Madipur bus stop. They saw the youths waiting at a bus stand on the opposite side of the road. “When we walked up to them, one of them started running away. Sheetal chased and caught the other. She is a half back and can chase her opponents well in a hockey game,” Rashi said.
 
 Ritu said that the youth started crying when he was caught and pretended to be a victim, but Rashi’s phone soon spilled out of his pocket. “We thrashed him till a policeman came and stopped us,” she added.
 
 Police have found the youth, Dalchand, to be an active snatcher in the area. “Efforts are being made to track down his associates. We have rewarded the three girls for their valour and bravery. They will be portrayed as role models for others,” said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar.
