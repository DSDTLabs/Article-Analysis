PUNE: Chief minister Devendra   on Wednesday blamed the country's traditional educational system for its failure to produce skilled workforce. 

 Speaking at Symbiosis Skills and  , he said that there is a need to bring flexibility in the education system to produce job-ready candidates.
 
 "Almost 50% of population in the country is within 35 years of age while 65% is within 30 years. This situation arises once in 200 to 300 years. When Europe was in a similar situation, it used its workforce and created history in development and progress," Fadnavis said while inaugurating the Symbiosis Skill Center of Excellence.
 
 Fadnavis also said that to create job opportunities, industries and institutions should come together. "Skill development is an important driver of economic growth. Students hesitate to join vocational education because of lack of vertical mobility and social acceptability. But the industry does not have skilled manpower and there is large-scale unemployment. To bridge the gap, Symbiosis Skills & Open University was established," founder  , said.
