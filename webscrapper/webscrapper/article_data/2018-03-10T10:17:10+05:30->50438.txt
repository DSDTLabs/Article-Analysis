CHENNAI: Unscientific relaying work causes road height to increase and puts residents under hardship, forcing them to raise the foundation to their homes, observed the   on Friday. 

 Chief Justice   made the observation after hearing arguments on a PIL filed by R  , a Chitlapakkam resident, before issuing directions to the executive officer of Chitlapakkam town panchayat to supervise relaying projects.
 
 According to the petitioner's advocate,  , the first bench issued orders to the Chitlapakkam EO to remove the top layer of surface using a process called cold milling. This prevents increase in road height after relaying. "The chief justice also directed the EO to conduct periodic supervision to ensure contractors scrape off the top layer before relaying," Sridharan said.
 
 Bala Chandar had filed the PIL last week seeking to restrain the town panchayat from going ahead with road relaying works in Chitlapakkam neighbourhood. When the matter was taken up for hearing on March 5, the government pleader had submitted orally that the panchayat would mill the roads before relaying.
 
 "We requested the chief justice to direct the government to file the undertaking as an affidavit, which was granted. On Friday, the government pleader submitted a letter signed by the EO. We requested the court to issue directions to the officer concerned about supervising the contractors so that they don't take advantage of the absence of an interim order on the PIL," said Sridharan.
 
 She said non-compliance of the directions would result in contempt. "Her (Banerjee) remark on unscientific road relaying was not specific to Chitlapakkam. It applies to city corporation as well as the rest of Tamil Nadu," Sridharan said.
