N  , who became  's first BJP CM, speaks to Oinam Sunil on the steps taken by him to improve the ties between his state and  . Excerpts:

 
 
 No state can ever think of changing its neighbours. We need to love and respect each other. I appreciate Shurhozelie's visit to Manipur. I, too, want to visit his state soon by road. Both of us want to make a new start.
 
 
 
 In the past, some leaders from both Nagaland and Manipur were working to promote their vested interests and did a lot of damage to the age-old ties between the two states. Shurhozelie, too, shares this view.
 
 
 
 The flow of essential commodi ties is normal now. My government will create a situation where we will not have such disruptions again.
 
 
 
 The Nagas of Manipur are our brothers and we will live together in Manipur. Nagaland is a good neighbour. NPF (which also supports the integration of   areas) has lent us unconditional support.
