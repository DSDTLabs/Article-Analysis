Villupuram: Following the strike by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation workers, scores of college students, including girls, on Tuesday staged a road blockade to register their protest against the lack of transport facilities to reach their institutions.

  The TNSTC workers, who have been on strike since Thursday, are seeking a wage revision, among other things.
 
 The students, who reached the Ulundurpet bus stand, from various villages grew restless after waiting for hours in the morning for buses to reach their colleges. A section of students, including girls, reached the depot and sought the staff members to operate buses to enable them to attend college. As they did not get a positive response from the depot staff, they staged a road blockade on the Villupuram-Trichy national highway to vent their anger.
 
 A team of police and revenue officials rushed to the spot and held peace talks with the protesting students, who dispersed after the team members assured that they will take up the issue with the authorities concerned and arrange for buses before and after the college hours.
