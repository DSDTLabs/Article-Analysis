 "I have requested them several times to refund the fee, but there was no response. FIITJEE received two years' course fee upfront and if they do not refund the money it would cost me huge monetary loss," contended Geetha, alleging deficiency of service and unfair trade practice.
 
 Director of FIITJEE contended that Abhiram left the institute voluntarily without intimation and the request for refund was not tenable as under terms and conditions of admission, 'Fees once paid is non-refundable.' The bench said, "To our mind even if a college puts out and stipulates that they will not refund the fee or make the candidate or his guardian to sign an agreement about non-refundability of the fee, it is bad in law. A student may leave mid-stream if he finds service provided unsatisfactory or not suitable to him and to tell him that 'fees once paid is not refundable' is uncalled for and amounts to an unfair trade practice and unjust enrichment of the institute." 
 
 It directed the opposite party to refund 75% of tuition fee charged, which amounts to 1,71,750, examination fee of 9,500. Apart from this, compensation of 1lakh and 5,000 towards cost were awarded.
