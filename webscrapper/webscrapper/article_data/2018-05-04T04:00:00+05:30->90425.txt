Surat: The Federation of Gujarat Weavers Association (FOGWA) has decided to hold a public meeting in the city on May 12 to fight against central government’s textile policy. FOGWA president Ashok Jirawala said, “We held a meeting of 30 local leaders from weaving segment belonging to Sachin, Pandesara, Jolva, Kim-Pipodara, Varachha, Kapodara, Ved Road, Katargam, Bhathena and Bamroli in the city on Thursday. We decided to start an agitation against the Centre’s textile policy.”  “We can’t tolerate a policy where input credit refund is not given to the weaver and further make us pay income tax on deposited credit. We want a policy on yarn prices. FOGWA opposes very high increase in yarn prices,” Jirawala said.
