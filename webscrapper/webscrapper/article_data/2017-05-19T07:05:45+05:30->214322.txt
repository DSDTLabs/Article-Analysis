NAGPUR: Although   station has enhanced its position in cleanliness by improving its overall ranking from 310th position in 2016 to 237 in 2017, the third party audit by the   in ranking has identified several grey areas.

 This is the second survey conducted by Quality Council of India (QCI) with the help of their partners. It surveyed 407 major railway stations (75 of ‘A1’ category & 332 of ‘A’ category) across the Indian Railways. Of the 75 A1 stations, Nagpur stands at 54, but in overall ranking it is at 237 with a score of 627.
 
 At Central Railway Zone level, Nagpur station has ranked 25th, far behind Ballarshah (5th), Chandrapur (6th) and Wardha (7th), which are all ‘A’ category stations. These three stations have also improved their ranking to 33rd, 38th and 39th position this year, from 251, 260 and 215 respectively last year. Even small stations like Akola, Latur, Daund, Jalgaon, Shegaon and others in the state are better placed.
 
 Nagpur Central Railway PRO PD Patil said Nagpur has improved its position by improving level of cleanliness on platforms, toilets, waiting rooms, parking, tracks etc. However, Nagpur still has a long way to go to come in the first 5.
 
 Dr Ashok Tripathi, chairman of the   (PAC), Railway Board, said, “The ranking of Nagpur station is not up to the mark. Officials will have to improve their efficiency. I had visited the station thrice last year and during inspection, pointed out many weaknesses.”
 
 Nagpur needs to improve on war-footing, especially in areas like sanitation, maintenance, cleaning of trains, and ventilation. “Trains are not cleaned properly and the end result is that there are rodents and cockroaches in coaches. There is lack of cleanliness near pit-lines. Though the area doesn’t concern passengers, it indirectly reflects on them,” said Tripathi.
 
 General secretary of Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK) Basant Shukla too said that despite being one of the best stations in Central India, Nagpur has not done well on cleanliness front. “It is shameful that the station of CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s hometown has done so badly,” said Shukla.
 
 Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) member Brijbhushan Shukla said a joint inspection of DRUCC and ZRUCC committee members was held in December last year. Several suggestions were submitted to the administration but no action was taken. The suggestions included ban on plastic carry bags by eateries and vendors at the station, installation of more dustbins and cleanliness at base kitchen backyard.
