BHATINDA: The informal Sarbat Khalsa-appointed ‘jathedars’ have taken a strong note of Sikh politicians from all political parties lining up at Sirsa-based   to seek support for the Punjab assembly elections scheduled for February 4.

 They have decided to hold a meeting of the five high priests to decide about taking action against politicians, who believe in Sikhism, for violating the edict issued from   of severing ties with the dera.
 
 The ‘jathedars’ also accused the NDA government at the Centre and SAD-BJP government in Punjab of failing to solve cases of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib and killing of two persons in police firing at   in Faridkot district last year. They have again asked Sikh masses to vote against the Badal family-led Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).
 
 Talking to newspersons on Monday, ‘jathedar’ Baljit Singh Daduwal said, “We will soon convene a meeting of the five priests and will take a decision on what action must be taken against the Sikh politicians who visited the dera against the Akal Takh’s edict. The edict issued from Takht for severing ties with the dera on May 17, 2007, is still in force as there has been no decision to the contrary.”
