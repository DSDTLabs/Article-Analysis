HYDERABAD: The   on Wednesday advised caution to the government as the latter moves ahead with its plan of distributing 84 lakh   to 2 lakh   in the state over the next two years. 

  from Kalwakurthy Vamsichand Reddy called on the government to be careful with regard to the health of sheep that Telangana is buying from other states. He said a team of officials and shepherd community representatives found sheep from  , Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and some parts of Maharashtra to be suitable for rearing in Telangana.
 
 He said as per central government statistics, Maharashtra has about 20 lakh sheep, Karnataka 74.5 lakh, Tamil Nadu 29 lakh while AP has 60 lakh. "The government must bear in mind that only 30% of these animals are aged between one and two years, which is ideal for distributing to shepherds." The Congress MLA further contended that of the the nearly 55 lakh young sheep available, half of them are unlikely to be in perfect health. "This leaves a small number for buying. How does the government plan to buy 84 lakh of sheep under these circumstances?" he asked.
 
 Animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav explained the government plan to distribute the sheep and called on the Congress member to appreciate the programme instead of attempting to raise doubts, especially as a large number of Reddy's constituents come from sheep rearing communities.
