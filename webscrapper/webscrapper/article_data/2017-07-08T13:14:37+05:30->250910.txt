UDHAGAMANDALAM:   want the   to take  , found wandering on the main roads in the town, causing hindrances to motorists, including tourists.

 “A drive through the uphill roads in the vacation town should be a pleasant experience, except for stray animals like domestic buffaloes on the roads. The situation is quite dangerous,” said L Shanmugam, a tourist from Salem.
 
 As many as 40-50 stray animals are found almost on all the main roads in Ooty town causing hindrance to traffic. “It is risky driving in the town nowadays. Motorists should be extremely cautious about the behaviour of stray horses, buffaloes and cows. Police should take immediate steps to curtail the menace,” said B Manohar, a local resident.
 
 Most of the horses found on the roads are engaged for horse riding. Over 50 pony horse owners have been authorised by the tourist department to conduct horse riding trips for tourists. They have also been provided with a huge stable.
 
 However, a member of the Ooty Pony Horse Owners’ Association blamed unscrupulous operators for the stray animal menace in town. “We, the pony horse owners in Ooty, have an association. Our horses have a permanent stable near the Ooty Lake provided by the tourism department. The department has also given us identification cards. The stray horses are local breeds used only during the season by unauthorised operators. They leave the animals loose for grazing, which end up on the roads,” he told TOI.
 
 It is difficult to find out the owners of the milch animals straying on the main roads. Yet, the cows and buffaloes disappear from the streets during the night hours.
