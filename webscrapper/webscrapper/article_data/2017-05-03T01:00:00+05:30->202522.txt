 made the most of her recent trip to  , which was a work-cum-mini-vacation with husband   by her side. On one of the days, the actress bumped into Hollywood star   in the English capital. Shilpa, a huge fan of the 71-year-old starâ€™s work, decided to make the most of it. Given how fit Goldie looked for her age, their conversation veered towards health, food and fitness.
