MUMBAI: The   on Friday accepted submissions made by the state on the mechanism for the current academic year on fee reimbursement to   in   across Maharashtra.

 With nearly 6 lakh reserved category students’ applications pending, the state said it would make an exception and directly reimburse the amount as a lump sum to the educational institutions instead of crediting them into the students’ bank accounts. This will be ‘a one-time exercise’ to be performed in respect of the current academic year only, said advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, when asked to step in by the HC in a petition filed by Sinhagad Technical Education Institute. He said that the cabinet had taken a decision on May 3 on the reimbursement mechanism. 
 
 In Maharashtra, four departments grant scholarships or reimbursements to students. These are social justice department for scheduled caste category students; tribal department for tribal category students); and VJNT, SBC & OBC department; and higher and technical education department for economically backward class category students. 
 
 The government was directly paying amounts payable under its schemes to eligible students to the institutions concerned. However, many institutes played a “large scale fraud...showing bogus students” thus causing loss to the state exchequer and the hence, last April the state decided to send the amounts directly to students’ Aadhaar-linked bank accounts, instead of paying the institutions directly. The students then are expected to pay the institutes’ fees.
 
 The state, on Friday, said it has already paid many students. By March 31, the social justice department received almost 3.3 lakh applications of which 1.3 lakh are pending for scrutiny and almost 1.5 lakh students paid a total Rs 320 crore into their Aadhaar-linked accounts. The department expects two lakh more applications. Also, the VJNT, OBC & SBC department received 12 lakh applications of which 7.5 lakh students were paid Rs 1,650 crore.
