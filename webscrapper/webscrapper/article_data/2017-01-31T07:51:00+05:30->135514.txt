GHAZIABAD:   and cash worth Rs 42 lakh were stolen from a mobile phone   located on the premises of   in Indirapuram’s Ahimsa Khand-1 on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.

 The police said the burglars made off with over 150 mobile handsets of different brands like Samsung,   and Gionee after carefully selecting the ones priced above Rs 12,000-15,000. The phones had been taken out of their packaged boxes, and the boxes had been left behind. The shop, Majestic Mobile House, is located near the main entrance gate of the mall. The shop owner, Irfan Khan, is a resident of Patel Nagar,  , and has another mobile store in Sector 18, Noida. “It is likely that the burglars attacked my shop after 12.30am, because the last movie show in the multiplex of the mall gets over around that time,” said Irfan Khan, who owns the shop.
 
 According to the police, security guards are deployed at the mall all night and the burglary wouldn’t have been possible without the involvement of someone among the security guards. 
 
 “It seems unbelievable that something like this happened right outside the main gate of the mall without anyone knowing about it. Normally it would have taken more than two hours to commit this kind of a crime,” said Pradeep Tripathi, SHO of Indirapuram police station. Representatives of the mall were unavailable for comments despite several attempts.
