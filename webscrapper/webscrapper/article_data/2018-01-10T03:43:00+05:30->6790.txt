Yavatmal: Janardhan Mahadeo Uikey (50), who consumed pesticide on Monday, became the third member of his family to commit suicide, in village Jarur of Ghatanji tehsil in Yavatmal. The family has blamed crop failure and burden of loan liabilities for his suicide. Earlier, his younger brother Ashok Mahadeo Uikey and nephew Sudarshan Ashok Uikey had committed suicide due to burden of loan dues. Sudarshan had committed suicide five years ago while Ashok had committed suicide four years ago. Due to scanty rainfall, followed by the bollworm attack, Janardhan suffered heavy losses, and was under pressure from the cooperative society that had loaned him Rs90,000. In fact, he had been identified for the loan waiver benefit by the government, but the amount had not been credited to his account so far. This forced him to take the extreme step, relatives claimed. In yet another incident, a farmer hailing from village Arambhi of Digras tehsil, Babulal Chavan (55), committed suicide by jumping into the farm well on Monday. He owned three acres of land and the crop failed due to the attack of bollworm. He also faced a loan liability. The Zilla Shetkari Nyaya Hakk Andolan Samiti led by ex-MLA Vijayatai Dhote visited the house of Janardhan on Tuesday and consoled the bereaved families, and also helped them by extending financial assistance.
