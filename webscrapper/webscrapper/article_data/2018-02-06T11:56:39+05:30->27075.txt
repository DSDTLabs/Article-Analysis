Actor   has confessed his priorities have changed since he had a child and he has shunned working out to spend more time with his son Pip.

  
  
 "Pip wakes us up about 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. He's a good sleeper and we know we're lucky with that. One of us has to shower while the other is getting him breakfast, then it's straight into playtime. Pip started nursery recently and thinks he knows everything. We have two toy cockapoos,   and  , who are also very demanding of our attention."
 
 According to report, "Breakfast might be scrambled eggs with chorizo on sourdough. I'll usually make a big pot of coffee while Laura drinks tea. It doesn't take me long to get ready - I basically use deodorant, that's it," Claflin told.
 
 He added, "I'm just not a moisturising kind of guy. I have very basic shampoos and shower gels - it's Laura who buys all the nice stuff. And I don't do all that much exercise. When I can, I go for a run, but I'd rather spend that hour with Pip." Reportedly, claflin feels 'lucky' to have such a supportive set of family and friends.
