Greg  , lately, has been the favourite whipping boy among cricketer- writers and former players at the recent wave of book release functions across the country, but the former India coach has received a gift from the players which he will be encashing on.

 
 He is holding a dinner on May 24 at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and one of the items on sale is a bat signed by the 2007 World T20-winning India side. The MS Dhoni-led team had won that tournament in South Africa, beating Pakistan in the final.
 
 Chappell confirmed this to Mirror, hoping that the Sydney-based Indians will be well-represented at the dinner. “Out of the 400-odd attendees, about 30 will be Indian-Australians (NRIs) who have each paid the $275 entrance to support the cause (The Chappell Foundation helps alleviate youth homelessness) in their adopted country. They will undoubtedly bid hotly for a couple of auction items with an Indian flavour, including a bat autographed by the 2007 T20 World Cupwinning team,” he said.
 
 The SCG is Chappell’s favourite ground where he made 182 in his last Test 34 years ago. Brothers Ian and Trevor will be in attendance but the cynosure of all eyes should be one of Don Bradman’s 1948 “Invincibles”, Neil Harvey, who turns 90 on October 8.
 
 Chappell further said, “There will also be NRI interest in bidding for premium seating at the   when India play Australia later this year and for a hospitality suite at the SCG during the subsequent Sydney Test against India, in January 2019.”
 
 Sydney-based Indian businessman Darshak Mehta OAM, a member of Mumbai’s Cricket Club of India, is the chairman of the Chappell Foundation. Mehta was honoured with an Order of Australia (equivalent to the Padma Shri) by the Australian government last year for his service to the Australian community. The Foundation is hoping to raise over $200,000 at the charity dinner.
