Would you believe if we told you that   was heavily pregnant with her first child when she was shooting for a song in her last Kannada release,  ? Well, that was exactly what transpired. The actress, who got married during the making of the film, was later also with child along the way. “I was seven months pregnant when we shot for the final song. The team of the film knew about my condition and was extremely caring and understanding. What helped was that I wasn’t showing much at the time,” says Nikita, who has just debuted pictures of her little one on social media. “We’ve named her   and she is just over six months old now. I did not keep her out of the spotlight before this, as I have been travelling with her. It’s just that no one really noticed her with me. I figured that now is a good time to introduce her to the world,” says Nikita.
