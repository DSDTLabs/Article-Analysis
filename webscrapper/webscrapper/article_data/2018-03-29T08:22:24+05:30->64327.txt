LUCKNOW: Apart from the approval for next financial year's budget, the   meeting on Thursday will take a decision on subjects like installation of water meters, floating of corporate bond for building a housing project on   and exemption on house tax to the disabled and senior citizens. 

 This is the first House meeting after civic polls and will hence be driven by important development issues like water scarcity, drains' cleaning, LED lights installation, repair of potholed roads, fogging etc. Corporators claim that the development work has been hampered for last six months, firstly because of civic polls and then due to LMC's laxity. 
 
 In a prime decision, the House will approve LMC's proposal to float municipal bonds worth Rs100 crore to build a posh housing project near SGPGI. This will have self-financed flats for all income groups and affordable housing for lower income group. The cost of flats will range from Rs10.5 to Rs64 lakh. 
 
 Another major decision is to develop smart parking solutions at LMC's three parking facilities -   and   in Lalbagh and   in Aminabad. These will be equipped with modern technology and will be run by private operators and   will get 42% share of the total parking fee collected.
