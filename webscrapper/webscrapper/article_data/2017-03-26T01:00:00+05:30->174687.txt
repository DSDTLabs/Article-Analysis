It was just another day for actress-danseuse Prachee Shah and her husband, director   Paandya, but a sudden text message from their friend (singer  ) asking if everything was fine between the two caught them off guard. Sonu had attached a snapshot of a Google search that showed Vishwas as Prachee’s ex-husband!

 Prachee says, “We saw that there was a mistake online. It is very strange. Vishwas and I have been happily married for over 10 years now. We don’t even have too many fights — not just because we are a sweet couple, but because we are so busy that we don’t have the time to fight!”
 
 The much-in-love couple has to thank their friend who works for the online search engine. He got the mistake rectified and reiterated to the world that they are a happily married couple. Says the actress, “He got it done for us quickly. But the initial damage was done with many people calling us to inquire about it. I don’t know how long it was up for. I am glad the confusion is over.”
