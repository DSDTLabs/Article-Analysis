HYDERABAD: Allegations of corruption against some corporators from the  , have stymied any chance of a demand for a special budget for GHMC corporators. Though a corporator's budget is not mandatory, the previous Congress government allowed GHMC to provide budget. 

 In united   all the 150 corporators were given 2 crore a year in the core areas and 2.5 crore in peripheral areas as this special budget. This has now been discontinued in the Council was elected in February 2016. Instead, corporators have been told to submit lists of works which GHMC will take up from the general budget. 
 
 GHMC corporators' plans began unravelling a few days ago when a TRS leader from LB Nagar held a meeting with some corporators and builders allegedly demanding money from the builders. 
 
 "Some corporators have been demanding a 'share' in each development work taken up by contractors on behalf of GHMC and water board. One corporator even claimed he had spent 2 crore in the GHMC elections. This is against the   rules which cap such expenditure at 5 lakh for each candidate," former Congress MLA D Sudheer Reddy said. He, along with some other leaders has asked the  , Chief Electoral Officer and   to probe the claim. 
 
 But some corporators maintain that there is a need for a separate budget for them. "The GHMC takes up work on roads, street lights or projects on the main roads and priority areas. We are responsible for the people who elected us for their grievances and need to respond quickly if people seek a patchwork on the roads or street lights," former mayor Mohd Majid Hussain told TOI. 
 
 Sources said some corporators raised the separate budget issue at the Council meeting which was then considered by the corporation. But after the episode at LB Nagar, municipal minister KT Rama Rao is learnt to nixed the proposal as it might result in corruption.
