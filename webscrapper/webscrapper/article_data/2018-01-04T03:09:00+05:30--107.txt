Margao: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar visited Margao on Wednesday to address apprehensions raised over the possible flooding of low-lying areas once fields are filled for construction of the  . 

 Parrikar, after visiting certain flood-prone areas at Maddel, Mungul and Khareband, reassured the people that the bypass stretch passing through the flood plains of Salcete will be designed to ensure that no inundation takes place. 
 
 “Provisions will be made to allow free flow of water under the road (passing over fields). The road will not be a barrier for the flow of water,” Parrikar told reporters, in the presence of minister for town and country planning Vijai Sardesai, Congress Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro and NCP Benaulim legislator Churchill Alemao, after inspecting the sites. 
 
 “We will take care of the concerns raised by the people. Their major concern was about flooding (which occurs because there is no free flow of rain water). To take care of that, a small bridge-type structure will be constructed. Leave the design and structural part to us. They want passage for water, and the design will take care of that,” Parrikar said. 
 
 Parrikar’s assurances assume significance in view of the demands made by Sardesai, Faleiro and Alemao that the bypass along the low-lying stretches be constructed on stilts. He had earlier promised to build the bypass passing through the Salpem lake in Navelim on stilts, in a bid to protect the lake, which is the catchment area of Sal river.
 
 The 11-km Western Bypass from Nuvem to Navelim, which passes through Mungul and Comba, has been faced with public protests largely owning to fears of large scale flooding of low-lying areas. The three local legislators have also been quite vocal and supportive of the demand that the bypass be constructed on stilts in the low-lying stretches.
