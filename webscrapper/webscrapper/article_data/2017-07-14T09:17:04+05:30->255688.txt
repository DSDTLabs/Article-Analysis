BAREILLY: Sukh Lal, 40, a resident of Fatehganj West, and a   had spent Rs 2 lakh on his daughter’s   thinking that the Uttar Pradesh government’s marriage grant scheme will bail him out of his debts. However, his hopes shattered when he learnt about the government’s latest move of discontinuing the scheme.

  “A friend had told me about the government’s scheme and I was a bit relaxed. Without thinking much I borrowed Rs 50,000 to make sure that the preparations for my eldest daughter’s wedding was up to the mark. Now, after knowing that the scheme has been stopped, I am clueless.”
 
  The previous Samajwadi Party government had launched the Vivah-Anudan (marriage grant) scheme, under which a poor family received a grant of Rs 20,000 for their daughter’s wedding. In the first three months of the current fiscal alone, Bareilly had registered 78 applications for the scheme. Around 825 poor families had benefitted from the scheme last year. The state government’s move to stop the scheme has disappointed a large number of people.
  District social welfare officer Ashok Dikshit said, “In the recently announced state budget the government didn’t allocate any funds for this scheme. The scheme will not continue for sure but we are awaiting official communication.”
 
  The latest development came to the fore when the BJP-led UP government unveiled its maiden budget on July 11. The government’s decision to stop the grant has shocked many a poor families in the state who depended upon the grant to clear their loans.
