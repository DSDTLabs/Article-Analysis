THANE: Thousands of homes in a few parts of the lake city will be affected by repair of two overhead supply tanks as the   supplied will be under  . The work, said civic officials, will go on till April 13. 

 The   Municipal Corporation (TMC) has undertaken repair work of the tanks at  , each with a carrying capacity of around 2.75 million litres. The tanks had reportedly showed signs of wear and tear over the last few months and needed major repair works, said civic officials. 
 
 However, the civic elections in February delayed the work and the repairs were taken up this week.
 
 Officials said repair work of one tank will be undertaken at a time to minimize inconvenience to residents. However, as the entire load of two tanks will be on the other water reservoir during the repair work, supply will have to be equally distributed resulting in less supply to certain areas. 
 
 Resultantly, thousands of homes in Chirag Nagar, Samata Nagar and Dnyaneshwar Nagar will receive water under low pressure until April 13 causing immense inconvenience to residents, especially during summer when the demand for water increases. 
 
 Locals questioned why TMC had to wait till summer as the same could have been completed before. 
 
 “The TMC could have started the work well ahead of the dry season and avoided such a situation. Already, there is water scarcity and if the supply is going to be restricted, it will cause inconvenience to residents,” said Swapnali Patil from Samata Nagar. 
 
 A civic official claimed that the work order for repairs of the two tanks was issued in December but got delayed because of elections. “We had issued work orders well in time. Repairs on the outer walls of the tanks was completed but the internal repair got delayed as all our employees were busy with the elections. The work will be completed soon,” said the official from the water supply department.
