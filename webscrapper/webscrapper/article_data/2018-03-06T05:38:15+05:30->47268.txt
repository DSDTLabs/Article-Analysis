NOIDA: Jaypee Infratech Limited on Monday issued a statement claiming that the complaint filed against its officials by an individual was not based on facts. The management also approached   for relief.

 The company told the Authority that some individuals were giving false police complaints as part of their efforts to grab parcel of land and in the process maligning the image of company. 
 
 “On March 3, once again they tried to grab the land, for which Noida Authority had given an affidavit in Allahabad high court that the land transferred to JIL was from within the acquired land of Noida Authority. By putting up tin sheets, and as the same was removed by JIL, they lodged a false police complaint,” the company said.
 
 On Saturday, Expressway police registered an FIR under Section 395 (dacoity) of IPC and named Japyee’s Sameer Gaur, Colonel Tiwana (retd), two senior officials   and  , and “hundreds of guards.”
