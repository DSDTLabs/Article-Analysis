AHMEDABAD: Today, the characters such as Jethalal, Hansraj Hathi or Tapu might be household names but before the major TV serial ‘Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’ started in 2008 and became overnight hit, it was a huge fan base for the author’s ‘Duniya ne Undha Chashma’ getting published in a Gujarati magazine since early 1970s.

 While Mehta worked extensively in theatre, it were his satires and humour that made him a household name in Gujarat.
 
 Mehta in his writing mentions that his mother’s demise when he was 10 days old and his childhood that was spent at his maternal grandparents’home formed his world view. He was afraid of his stepmother but could reconcile with the fact due to her loving nature. Before the happy ending, however, the child went through emotional turmoil that resulted in his ‘ulta chashma’ or looking at the world askew.
 
 ‘Duniya ne..’ was originally his three-act play of 1963 that had won multiple awards. It was after the push from late Vaju Kotak, founder of  , that Mehta agreed to write. “I got my characters from prolonged stay in various areas of Mumbai. I could see Jethalal in my neighbour Bhogilal and Tapu in his son. Likewise, those whom I knew from my stay in Ahmedabad also got added as occupants of my world,” Mehta mentioned in his writing.
