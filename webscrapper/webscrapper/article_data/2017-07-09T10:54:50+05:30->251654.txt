COIMBATORE: The Coimbatore District Cricket Association (CDCA) plans to take some cricket stadiums in private colleges on lease to conduct the   (TNPL) matches next year. 

 “Already, three districts, such as Coimbatore, Trichy and Salem are setting up stadiums following the international norms. The association will spend more than Rs 2 crore and support them with live telecast and other facilities,” said R N Babu, media manager, TNCA.
 
 S Gowthaman, secretary of the CDCA, said they had already begun work on the SNR and Sons college ground. “We have levelled the ground and have already filled it up with sand. Work on the turf and lawn will begin soon. By the end of this month, it will be ready and we are hopeful that TNPL will hold a match here next season,” he said. 
 
 To promote the league in the city, the association also plans to set up fan clubs and exhibitions on July 22 as part of the Tamil Nadu Premier League in which cricketers will interact with residents. Seven players from Coimbatore are also taking part in the league this year, said Gowthaman
 
 This season, the number of matches played in the districts has also been increased to 24 from 18 last year. “This year, 13 matches will be played in Tirunelveli and 11 will be held in Dindigul. The remaining will be held in Chennai,” said Babu. 
 
 About out-station players not taking part in the league, Babu said that they were planning to take it up in the right forum with the BCCI after the season is over. S Badrinath, captain of Dindigul of   squad said though the pedigree of the event would have increased if bigger names had taken part in the league, the event will not be affected by it. 
 
 “It was huge success last year. Moreover, this allows more local talent to take part in the event and provide them a platform,” Badrinath said.
