NEW DELHI:   is toeing the middle line on   taking over as chief minister of  , breaking from the critical stance of its ally   in a bid to keep its options open for the future. 

  Party sources said the decision of Jayalalithaa's close aide   to replace O Pannerselvam as chief minister is more tricky than it appears and the party would best watch how the situation unfolds. 
 
 Former finance minister P   mocked Sasikala's proposed elevation, tweeting, "Looking back with pride, TN CM chair was occupied by Kamaraj and Anna.   and people of TN are now moving in opposite directions."
 
 However, sources said Congress has adopted a neutral stand on the issue - that MLAs are free to elect their leader, implying that Chidambaram's aggression may be his "personal view".
 
 Interestingly, Congress believes the Sasikala story will take around three months to settle and the party would rather wait.
 
  It is felt that AIADMK cadres have still not warmed up to the idea of Sasikala in the top chair and her first test will be to come clear in the corruption case and then win a by-election with a thumping majority.
