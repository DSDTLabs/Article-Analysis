Chennai: Noting that there cannot be two different types of treatments for a single class of life convicts, when it comes to premature release, Rajiv Gandhi assassination life convict S Nalini has approached the Madras high court challenging the constitutionality of section 435 (1) (a) of the CrPC. Section 435 (1) (a) mandates the state government to consult the central government to remit or commute a sentence, in any case where the sentence is for an offence which was investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act. According to Nalini, the Tamil Nadu government passed an order dated February 1 introducing a scheme of premature release of life convicts under Article 161 (Power of governor to grant pardons, and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases) of the Constitution. But she would not be eligible for the scheme, since there is a specific clause in the order, to the effect that the cases of eligible life convicts should not come under section 435 of CrPC. Since the offence for which Nalini was convicted was investigated by the CBI, she was becomes ineligible for premature release under the scheme, prompting her to approach the court assailing the validity of section 435. “ The convicts are released only on the basis of good conduct in prison, which can be assessed only by the respective state government, the law mandating the state to consult the Centre would be irrational,” Nalini said.
