This has been a torturous April for Nagpurians, with people left reeling in the aftermath of soaring temperatures. While people are braving the 45 degree Celsius heat on the chin, the caring   parents are going all out to ensure that their pooches don’t have to suffer the temperature blues. Here’s the update on this affair royale…

 Every  , the electricity bills make people cry in the city, yet keeping the worries of spiralling electricity bills aside, some of the pet parents have set up AC kennels and rooms for their pampered babies. A passionate pet parent and entrepreneur, Seema Sengupta, shares, “My pet sons –   (Golden Retriever) and Rambo (Double coat German Shepherd) – stay in AC room, 24x7 because both of them have hair longer than many of the ladies. They are given a bath once a week and they have their own conditioners, shampoos and powders to ensure that they remain odour free and happy throughout.”
 
 Along with cool rooms, many pet parents are indulging their pooches with their tiny personal pools too. A homemaker, Mamta Kanga shares, “Since we couldn’t afford a proper pool, I got a kiddy pool for our labrador baby Mojo. Now my daughter Meher and Mojo play games in the pool and I love watching their antics. My pet baby has found a way to beat the summer blues by taking a dip in the pool whenever he feels hot and then he gets tired and enjoys a long nap.”
 
 The outer luxury accorded to these pooches is definitely quite enviable, but their pet parents also ensure that their   and hair remain equally healthy. A pet spa owner, Hemant Kinhikar, reveals, “We are giving zero cuts to Labs and Golden Retrievers to help them beat the heat. Shih Tzus and Lhasa Apsos, on the other hand, are getting   cuts with their hair clipped on top, to help them fight with the crazy Nagpur heat. To keep their skin healthy and vitalised, we are giving herbal neem bath to our pet clients, which takes care of itching and hair fall in this season.”
