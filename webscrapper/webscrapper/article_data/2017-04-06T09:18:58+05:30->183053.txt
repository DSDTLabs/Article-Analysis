LUCKNOW: Analysing profiles of those duped by a Gujarat-based   involved in   of debit and credit cards, police found majority of them were government employees. 12 FIRs have been lodged since April 1 and over 50 complaints have been received.

 In what seems to be the job of an organised gang of cyber criminals with countrywide reach, debit cards of Lucknow residents were cloned and money withdrawn in   on April 1, 2 and 3 though the cards remained in possession of their original owners throughout.
 
 Policemen at Hazratganj-based cyber cell found out that on April 1, bank accounts of 11 government employees were hacked to bungle close to Rs 3 lakh on a single day.
 
 Eight of these are working at government offices located in Indira Bhawan or   in   while remaining three worked at other government offices in Hazratganj.
 
 “Their complaints have been clubbed and FIR had been lodged at Hazratganj police station as that will make it easier to claim money for these victims. Others have also been directed to register FIRs at the nearest police stations,” said VVS Sirohi, in-charge of cyber cell.
