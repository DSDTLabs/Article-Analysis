PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: After more than 22 years, the   has decided to prepare a new development plan for old city areas. 

 The town planning department will appoint a consultant or a private agency to prepare a land use map with geographical information based system and satellite imagery. 
 
 Civic officials said the present DP, which covers an area of 86sqkm, was approved by the state government in 1995. The old city areas include Pimpri, Chinchwad, Nigdi, Akurdi, Bhosari and other villages. 
 
 The state government had transferred some areas under Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority and had approved a separate DP for these areas in 1997. Prakash  , deputy director, town planning ,  , said, “There is a need to prepare a new DP. A survey will be conducted to find out the usage of land and its current status. The survey will be completed in six months. The land use map will be used to prepare the new DP.” 
 
 Civic officials said the new DP will be prepared as per the provisions and regulations of the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act 1966. Suggestions from members of the public will be sought while preparing the draft DP. 
 
 The consultant will have to procure latest satellite, high-resolution cloud-free images, which will help in seamless and accurate presentation of old city limits. 
 
 The consultant will also have to submit a detailed existing land use report along with statistics as per guidelines of the PCMC’s town planning department. 
 
 Information regarding schools, colleges, hospitals as well as a report of existing public, semi-public amenities will also have to be submitted.
 
 After the DP for the old city areas was approved by the state in 1995, 18 villages were merged in PCMC limits in 1997. 
 
 Later, the PCMC prepared a new DP for the 18 villages and obtained an approval for it in 2009. There is no need to prepare a new DP for these villages, civic officials said.
