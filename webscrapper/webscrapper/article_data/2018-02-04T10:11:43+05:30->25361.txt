SHILLONG: It is moments of genius on the part of a team or the lack of the same in their opposition that often win matches. This was proved once again at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Saturday as   showed the passion and commitment but lacked the application as they went down 3-0 to   on a sub-10 degree Saturday evening.

 
 On being asked ahead of the crucial   encounter if his team would be pushing for an early breakthrough, Bagan coach Shankarlal Chakraborty had said all his team wanted was three points from the game. His men got him those points, as Bagan leapfrogged arch-rivals East Bengal into third spot, having played the same number of matches, amassing the same 20 points but with a better goal difference. Lajong, who did impress in parts with their pace, would have to be content with the fifth spot with just four more matches remaining.
 
 I-League top-scorer   was there in the box at the right moment to head home an Akram Moghrabi corner in the 30th minute. Man-of-the-match Moghrabi got his name on the scoresheet when substitute Raynier Fernandes served him a through on a platter and the Lebanese made no mistake in shooting past Lajong goalkeeper Phurba Tempa Lachenpa. Bagan substitute Sheikh Faiaz made a solo run from the left flank in the 89th minute and scored the visitorsâ€™ third goal from a one-on-one with the goalkeeper.
 
 
 Chennai City FC (CCFC) remained winless at home after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Aizawl FC at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Coimbatore on Saturday. With 11 points from 13 games, Chennai City rose one spot on the table to ninth above Gokulum FC.
