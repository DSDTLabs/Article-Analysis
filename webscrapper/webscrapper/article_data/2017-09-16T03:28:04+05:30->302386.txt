NAVI MUMBAI: The   community   built for residents of a housing society, Gharkul, in sector 15 of Kharghar has remained unused for years. Cidco had taken over the community hall for its proposed estate office and have even spent few lakhs on the makeover but it has not been put to use yet. 

 The hall is a ground plus one storey building and the ground floor has a number of shops. Around 1,400 residents have not been able to organize meetings and programmes.
 
  chairman Gorakhnath Surve said, “We have met Cidco officials. Another round of written communication will start. The residents have been inconvenienced as they are not able to even organize a meeting to discuss their issues.” 
 
 However, Cidco Kharghar administrator   said, “Illegal activities were going on in the hall. We stopped that and constructed the estate office. However, the residents demand will be considered.”
