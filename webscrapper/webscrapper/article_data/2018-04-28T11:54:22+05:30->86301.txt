LUCKNOW: Reiterating the BJP-led state government’s agenda to focus on Dalits and backward communities while implementing schemes, chief secretary   on Friday told officials to run a special campaign “to ensure that government beneficiary schemes reach deserving Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes”. He also directed officials to ensure that “transparent” action is taken on FIRs lodged by those from the SC/ST communities.

 
 The chief secretary’s directions come weeks after a major protest by Dalits and backward communities rocked the state. In its aftermath, several people were arrested for vandalism and rioting.
 
 In a meeting with the social welfare department,   said: “Transparent action should be taken against any FIR lodged by affected SC/ST people, and officers should ensure help in time.”
