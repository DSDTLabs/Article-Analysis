Suraj Gowda’s happy lately, and this time because his cat   is all set to debut in films. Coincidentally, Charlie will be debuting in a film directed by Arvind Sastry, who made   — the first film Suraj signed as a lead actor. This as-yet-untitled film stars Ashu Bedra and Sangeetha Bhat in lead roles and is currently being shot. “It was a very nice feeling to have Arvind call me asking me for Charlie’s dates. He will be playing Sangeetha’s pet in the film,” says Suraj. Charlie, meanwhile, has his own Instagram page and has around 900 followers. “Charlie has had offers earlier as well, but I chose to ensure that he acts in this film only because Arvind is directing it,” signs off Suraj.
