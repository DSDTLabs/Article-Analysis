BHIWANDI: A 51-year-old   resident, Usha Mahatre, was   and   on Monday night in a building that houses several policemen. While fleeing with cash and valuables totalling Rs  , the killer took along the digital video recording (DVR) machine installed inside the flat to avoid being recognized. Thane police suspect the killer was known to the victim as she had served the person three packets of chips and a glass of water, which was left untouched. There was no sign of forcible entry either.

 The flats right below and above the victim’s first-floor residence are occupied by a policemen’s families. The cops were away on duty when the crime occurred. Thane police have formed four teams to probe the case.
 
 On Monday night, Mahatre was home alone in her C-Wing flat at   in the Kongaon locality of Bhiwandi. Usha’s son Praveen, a labour contractor-cum-moneylender by profession, was visiting his in-laws in Dombivli with his homemaker wife Shweta and their five-month-old son. He left home around 1.30pm.
 
 When Praveen returned around 7pm and opened the door with his set of keys, he found his mother lying dead in the hall and Rs 3.5 lakh in cash and other valuables totalling Rs 13 lakh missing. He immediately called Kongaon police. Praveen told TOI that he too suspects that the killer was known to the family. He said, “My mother and even my wife would never allow an unknown person entry to our flat.” He said his mother had called up a local shop and asked them to deliver chips around 4.30pm.
 
 Police have registered a case of robbery, trespassing and   against unidentified persons.
 
 Mangesh Sawant, senior police inspector of Kongaon police station, said, “The preliminary probe shows that some known person is involved in the crime but we are probing the case from all angles.”
