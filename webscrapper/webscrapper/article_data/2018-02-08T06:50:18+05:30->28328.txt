BENGALURU: India’s largest   (USL) is selling its corporate headquarters in the   as the company looks to monetize assets and detach itself from the legacy of the former owner and fugitive tycoon  

 The company, now controlled by British giant Diageo, has started a process to sell four levels totalling 31,000sqft for about Rs 100 crore. USL will take up a new property on lease in north Bengaluru. Sources aware of the development said the deal could be valued at Rs 30,000 per sqft, considering the market rates. Property consultancy JLL, which has the mandate to run the process, declined to comment. “This move is in line with our strategy to monetize non-core assets,” a USL spokesperson said in an emailed statement to TOI.
  
  
 
 The company is in the process of selling other non-core assets — including 13 properties which were previously offered to Mallya — to reduce its debt. The residential and commercial properties include villas in Mumbai, Goa and Delhi. Other properties are spread across Mumbai, Bengaluru, Goa, Kolkata and Hong Kong. It also raised Rs 750 crore from the market last year to balance its debt by issuing non-convertible debentures.
 
 USL occupies 6th to 10th floors, and United Breweries is on 3rd to 5th floors. USL, which has had its headquarters in the building since 2007, is selling four of the five floors it occupies. The rest is held by   & Fertilizers and United Breweries (Holdings), the holding company of Mallya.
 
 UB City, jointly built by Mallya and property developer Prestige, has a total builtup area of 1.6 million sqft. TOI reported in 2012 that UB (Holdings) was in talks with private equity firm Blackstone and   (KKR) to unlock the value of its office spaces through a structured equity deal for roughly Rs 650 crore.
