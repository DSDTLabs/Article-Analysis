Chandigarh: After getting a go-ahead from the chief ministerâ€™s office on Sunday, the Haryana government has decided to appoint nodal officers (litigation) in all the departments.

 The move is being made following the growing litigations in the state, especially in the wake of Right to Service Act and Right to Information Act.
 
 The roles and responsibilities of a nodal officer would be to consider each and every petition or notice under Section 80 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) positively within a period of 30 days from the date of its issue/receipt.
 
 All legal notices, petitions, letters from the office of advocate general of Haryana regarding legal matters would be sent to the nodal officer concerned, who would be responsible for bringing it to the notice of their respective additional chief secretary, financial commissioner or head of the department for further necessary actions like filing of appeals, writ petitions, civil revisions, RSA and arbitration cases.
