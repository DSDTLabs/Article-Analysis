PATNA: Senior officers of state police headquarters will hold a meeting with SPs of 17 districts through videoconferencing within a week to discuss law and order situation. These districts recorded a 20% jump in heinous crimes like murder, rape, kidnapping, riots and robbery between January 2016 and November last year.

 These districts are the ones which have a share of more than 60% of total crime that took place in 40 police districts across the state during the abovementioned period.
 
 Senior officers of state police headquarters had attended a high level meeting chaired by CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday to review overall crime scenario in the state. ADG (headquarters) S K Singhal said sub-divisional police officers (SDPOs) would also be present at the videoconference.
 
 “Rohtas, Bhagalpur, Nalanda and Begusarai are the top four districts where crime increased by 20% in the last two years. An analysis by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) of state police has confirmed this,” the ADG said, adding efforts are being made to curb crime against women through proper investigation and arrest of the accused. “If necessary, we will hold separate meetings with SPs of 17 districts where crime rate saw a sharp jump,” Singhal added.
 
 The ADG said policing would be made citizen-centric in the state. “Several steps are being taken by the police headquarters to control crime in the state,” he added.
