PANAJI: BJP will have to make all its allies feel comfortable for them to wholeheartedly support the ruling party in the next   polls, Goa Forward leader and town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai said.

 “Being part of the BJP-led government, we are technically part of the NDA. I am clear on it. Why shouldn’t we leverage our position to get more benefits for the state of Goa? But, as far as the next parliamentary elections are concerned (in 2019), certain things would have to be done. BJP national president Amit Shah has already asked the BJP to make the allies feel comfortable and this will have to be done,” Sardesai told reporters when asked about the next Lok Sabha polls.
 
 “BJP’s core agenda is not ours. We’ll go by our agenda. The state government’s agenda is different from BJP’s core agenda. There will be a common minimum programme and this will be revealed on April 17. It has to be ‘Goem, Goenkar and Goemkarponn’. Persons like Subramaniam Swamy cannot be our spokespersons”, he said after the swearing-in ceremony of two ministers at   on Wednesday.
 
 The   said he made his point clear when he attended the NDA meeting called by Prime Minister   two days ago in New Delhi. “It was there that I made a specific point on extension of time for beach weddings. I will write a detailed letter to the PM and I think the CM may also write one,” Sardesai said.
 
 Sardesai said he brought to the notice of Shah that he is still being hated for his action to support the BJP-led government, “but I am quite confident that my action will be in the interest of the state in the long run”.
