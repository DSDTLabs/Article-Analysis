PANCHKULA: After TOI carried a report on problems being faced by residents due to the fire raging in the dumping ground since May 25, Panchkula   commissioner visited the dumping ground. The civic body has planned a new strategy to tackle the fire. 

 Although 109 fire tenders and 123 tractor trolleys of sand have been unloaded, the ground situation has not changed. MC commissioner Rajesh Jogpal said burning garbage has generated considerable methane gas. He attributed the constantly burning flames to the fire inside the garbage which cannot be seen on the ground.
 
 "To tackle the problem, we have called two JCB machines, have dug up holes and are piling sand inside. We are also pouring water into the holes to control the fire, which is not visible", said Jogpal.
 
 Fire department officials said the fire is about to reach the forest area situated next to the dumping ground, which could cause major losses to the state. 
 
 Fire station officer Shamsher Malik said, "One fire tender has been appointed specially for the dumping ground. Water does not work well on methane gas. Sand can work better."
 
 MC commissioner Jogpal said a layer of sand would be spread before dumping new garbage. He said the process would help stem the foul smell and stop methane gas from developing.
 
 The dumping ground is situated barely 200 metres from the residential area and thousands of families living in Sector 23 to Sector 28 are suffering from the dangerous fumes and foul smell emanating from the dumping ground.  , 41, a resident of Sector-23, said, "The worst affected are the elderly and new-born babies as well as people who have respiratory diseases like asthma."
