NEW DELHI: Trinamool   has kept a careful distance from the opposition notice for the CJI’s removal, indicating that   chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s unease — shared by DMK — about going along with the Congress-led move. 

 Banerjee as well as the DMK leadership are understood to have consulted legal experts and decided against associating with the notice and being part of what they see as a controversial move to confront the judiciary. 
 
 They see no reason to be perceived as hostile towards the SC when they have approached courts to argue what they hold to be politically-driven cases. As in the case of the panchayat polls or the agitation in Darjeeling, Banerjee would rather keep a distance from a messy confrontation that has political hues, said party sources. 
 
 She would also like opposition action to be coordinated through the federal front she has mooted where Congress does not have a particular primacy. The TMC chief has been in touch with other parties on the issue before deciding on whether or not to sign on to the move. 
 
 She spoke to Congress chief   when the discussion came up in the last leg of the Budget session, said sources. At that juncture, Banerjee is learnt to have told the Congress chief it would not be possible for her to support the move. 
 
 At the time, DMK also had a rethink and the move was paused. With the notice being submitted after Thursday’s SC decision not to order a probe in the death of judge B H Loya, Banerjee decided to avoid taking up common cause with Congress.
