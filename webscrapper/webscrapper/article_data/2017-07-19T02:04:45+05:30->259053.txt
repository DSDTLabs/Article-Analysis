NAVI MUMBAI: The missing   with speech disability, who was brought to a shelter home at New Panvel by the CBD police, has now been   with his family after six days.

 The   for Love (SEAL), where the boy was sent by the police circulated photos of the boy on social networking sites, which the boy’s father came across. 
 
 The father, Fariad Ali, a Kurla based cloth merchant immediately contacted the Navi Mumbai police and rushed to the shelter home on Monday to be reunited with the boy. 
 
 On July 13, the boy was found crying inconsolably at Belapur. “We thank God for His guidance to reunite the boy with his father. On July 12, the boy had taken Rs 10 from his father and told him that he was going out to play on the swing nearby. However, he somehow got lost and landed in Belapur where he kept crying out for his family. Since he has a speech problem, bystanders who wanted to help him could not do so. CBD police officials in Belapur also went out of their way to help the lost boy,” said K M Philip, SEAL founder.
 
 The boy, identified as Arbas Ali, is a class VII student at a Kurla school. His smile said it all the moment his father and elder brother walked inside the shelter home to take him back home.
