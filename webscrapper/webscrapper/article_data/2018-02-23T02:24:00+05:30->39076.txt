Guntur: Expressing his displeasure at dealers of fair price shops not following the prescribed timings, civil supplies minister Prattipati   warned the PDS dealers that nobody will be spared if they did not open the shops as per the schedule fixed by the government. 

 The minister asked the district civil supplies officers to closely monitor the performance of the dealers and remove those who did not follow instructions. The minister reviewed the performance of the department with district officials through a video-conference from the district collectorate here on Thursday.
 
 Speaking to officials, the minister said they have been receiving complaints about the dealers not keeping the shops open to distribute rice and other essential commodities. 
 
 “Make it clear to the dealers that they should keep the shops open from 8 am-12 noon and 4pm-8pm. We can’t allow people to suffer due to errant dealers,” he said. Pulla Rao asked joint collectors and revenue divisional officers to supervise the functioning of PDS shops. 
 
 He directed district officials to expedite the measures to convert PDS shops into Chandranna Malls. He said at least 1,500 shops should be converted into Chandranna Malls by March-end and 6,500 shops by June. He said Chandranna Malls were set up to supply more essential commodities and other consumer goods at cheaper prices.
 
 The minister asked officials to take steps to prevent the recycling of PDS rice by rice millers and   dealers and said surprise inspections by joint collectors and RDOs would keep the dealers and rice millers on a tight leash. He said social audits should be made mandatory at all PDS shops to ensure transparency. Civil supplies principal secretary B Rajasekhar, civil supplies commissioner Ravi Babu, and civil supplies corporation managing director Ramgopal were present.
