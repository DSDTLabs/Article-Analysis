THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: DGP T P   criticized chief minister  's statement that the government did not consider him a 'political opponent' while justifying his removal from the post of state police chief. In his reply before the   on Saturday to the counter-petition filed by the government, Senkumar said that the government's stand was invalidated by the fact that Vijayan had cast doubts on his aspirations by calling him a member of the opposite political party. 

 He said that Vijayan had made such a statement on the floor of the house on February 28 and March 8. Senkumar also produced the copies of Vijayan's statement in which he said that the opposition need not vouch for Senkumar anymore as 'he is in search of new camps and already reached a different camp', hinting that the officer was talking like a   sympathiser.
 
 Chief secretary S M Vijayanand, who submitted the petition on behalf of the government, said that Senkumar's transfer was an administrative necessity. "This was not a political vendetta as alleged by the petitioner," it read.
 
 Senkumar added that the petition, which said that the action against him was only a continuation of the proceedings of the previous government, was false. "This is evidenced from the fact that the respondent state government has not produced an iota of evidence indicating that the transfer of the petitioner was on the cards or had been discussed by the erstwhile government," he said.
 
 He further stated that there was a steep increase in the number of political murders after his removal as state police chief. He also submitted the list of 13 political murders that took place in   and Kozhikode from July 11, 2016 to February 18, 2017, to prove his point. He said that the decision to remove him from the post of state police chief was not even a cabinet decision.
