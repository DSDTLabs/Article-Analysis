THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Tribal families in the state do not face starvation and it was not hunger that led to the tragic death of  , said SC/ST welfare minister   in the assembly on Tuesday. “His family is not in abject poverty as painted by some,” the minister said.

 “You won’t see even a single tribal household that doesn’t keep food items stocked. The tribal youth didn’t die of poverty,” Balan added.
 
 He also denied the allegations that major share of the money earmarked for the welfare of   are siphoned off by officials concerned and middlemen. Major chunk of the money set aside for the development of these communities are used for providing educational assistance to students in the communities. Various programmes are rolled out to ensure the overall development of the tribal communities, in association with local self-government institutions and various government departments.
 
 Rejecting the demand raised by   that the state government should announce a ‘adivasi policy’ for the overall development of the people belonging to that community, Balan said such a common policy would not be feasible as problems faced by different sections within the tribal community are different. That is why the Union government did not formulate a common policy for them, he said.
