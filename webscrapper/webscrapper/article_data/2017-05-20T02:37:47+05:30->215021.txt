SRINAGAR: The   Conference reacted with anger and alarm to the Centre’s announcement of the NIA’s investigation into the source of its foreign funding.

 The   stepped in after allegations made by Hurriyat official Nayeem Khan of the Geelani faction that separatists, including  , received funds from Pakistan-based terrorist organisation   to carry out terror activities in the Kashmir Valley.
 
 Nayeem was stung earlier this week by reporters of India Today in which he had made these alleged disclosures.
 
 Hurriyat spokesman Ayaz Akbar, also of the Geelani faction, denied links to LeT, saying, “The agency has earlier harassed and questioned party officials, including Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai and Syed Geelani’s son-in-law, but could not find anything. These are fabricated charges to pressure us, as authorities are unable to control clashes in Kashmir.” JKLF chief  , who joined the Hurriyat in 2016, said, “They try to prove I’m receiving funds from Pakistan.
 
 They’ve tried to do the same many times but failed to prove me politically corrupt.” Sources said, “After completing the preliminary probe, NIA will question Geelani, Nayeem Khan, Gazi Javed Baba and Farooq Ahmed Dar alias Bitta Karate.”
