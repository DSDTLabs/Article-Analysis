Vadodara: They work round the clock to keep the city secure, but the call of duty seems to be taking toll on the health of policemen. A recent medical examination of 500 cops posted in city police headquarters revealed that majority of them have health issues. From Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) and police constables to head constables and assistant sub-inspector, the cops underwent a series of medical tests. 

 The test reports reveal that over 41% of cops who underwent physical checkup suffer from anemia. And about 33% are overweight. “Most policemen suffer from anemia due to poor food habits. They don’t consume nutritious food and eat at erratic timings and it leads to drop in haemoglobin levels in blood. Also, a variety of factors including thyroid, lack of physical activity and poor food habits makes some cops overweight,” said a police official. 
 
 Twenty one per cent of the policemen also suffered from diabetes while about 18% have high cholesterol level. Nearly 11% of those who underwent medical tests suffer from weak liver while about 6% have issues with kidney functioning. The medical examination began in February this year and continued for two months. “The idea was to get an idea about the health of the policemen,” said Manoj Sashidhar, city police commissioner. “We started from the headquarters as those posted there can’t afford regular doctors’ fees. Now a wellness programme is being designed for each cop according to his or her need.”
