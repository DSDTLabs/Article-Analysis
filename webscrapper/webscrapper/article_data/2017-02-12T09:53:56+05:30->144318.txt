VIJAYAWADA: Stressing on the need to abolish the   Justice Act,   said that getting away under the cover of juvenility is a wrong precedent and that special courts should be set up to conduct time-bound trials. 

 Speaking during the second day of National Women's   (NWP) on Saturday, Narasimhan said that exemplary punishment should be meted out to those who indulge in crimes against women. 
 
 "Call it infant crime or juvenile crime, crime is crime. Therefore, it is time to make amendments to the law," he said. He said that censorship of content is also an important aspect to be discussed. 
 
 Talking about the socio-cultural aspects, the governor appealed to the public to feel proud when a girl child arrives in a family. "If we stop defining one another by what we are not and start defining ourselves by who we are, we can all be free and enjoy freedomn," he said. He lauded the efforts of CM   and Speaker   for organising NWP.
