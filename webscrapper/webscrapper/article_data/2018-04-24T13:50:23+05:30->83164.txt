MUMBAI: The   on Monday stayed all proceedings initiated against actor   under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for allegedly using a derogatory word against the Dalit community while promoting his film ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’.

 A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud brushed aside additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s plea seeking time to take instructions on the matter.
 
 During a show for promotion of his film, Khan was asked to describe his appearance in a dance sequence in the movie, for which he had allegedly used the derogatory word. Criminal complaints were lodged against him in Delhi, Mumbai and several places in   and Gujarat. Khan said in his petition that the word he had used was not aimed at or directed towards any Dalit group and was merely used to describe his appearance in a dance sequence in the film. He said there was no question of humiliating or hurting the sentiments of any community.
