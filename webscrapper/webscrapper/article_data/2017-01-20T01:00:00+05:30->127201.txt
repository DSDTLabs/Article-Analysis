It was a day   aka Raju will never forget. The cobbler not only got to meet his screen idol,  , but even gifted a pair of handcrafted shoes to the superstar at a special event. 

 Raju got noticed after he placed a banner with one of SRK’s famous dialogues from his upcoming release, ' ', at his small shop in Vile Parle. It read: ‘Koi dhanda chota nahi hota aur dhande se bada koi dharam nahi hota’. Soon, the story of how this cobbler’s work was indeed worship for him, became popular on social media. And the rest, as they say, is history.
 
 In a quick chat with BT, Raju said, “Mujhe Shah Rukh Khan bhai ka baat bahut accha laga. Yeh mere dimag mein baith gaya.” And after meeting King Khan, Raju was floored by his warmth and benevolence. When he got emotional while posing for pictures, SRK hugged him, saying, “Main abhi sabko bolunga ki hum ne woh line tumhari dukaan se li hai.”
 
 Shah Rukh was moved by Raju’s gesture. He said, “I am a big believer in dignity of labour. I have maintained that in my house also — right from the very small things, to the very big things, I do them all myself. I think every job is amazing. When done with dignity, any job can get you the maximum amount of success and happiness.” 
 
 He added, “I am really touched that the message from the film — which perhaps is a little more convoluted than how Raju has taken it —has reached out to people. I hope everyone understands that we should respect people in whatever job they are. I am really happy that he has made this pair of shoes for me. I will wear them with the pathani next time.”
