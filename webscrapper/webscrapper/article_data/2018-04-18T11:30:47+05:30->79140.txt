CHARMINAR: A day after the ruling   government announced a Rs 1,000 crore package for the development of Old City,   Minority Morcha said these were empty pre-poll promises and the state government was not serious enough towards the   development.

 Bhartiya Janata Party Minority Morcha (BJPMM) spokesperson Mir   alleged that the ruling party and its alliance woke up to the Old City's development when only a year is left for elections.
 
 "I want to ask the chief minister of Telangana, what has been done for development of old city areas? Why no such announcement was made soon after the formation of separate state or government. If CM KCR claims to be committed towards Old City development, then will his machineries prove his commitment by completing all pending works in the old city,"? asked Firasat Ali Baqri.
 
 The BJP spokesperson said the announcement was nothing but an attempt to mislead people. HE said there were many public issues, including drainage, water, and mosquito menace in certain localities, which were yet to be resolved.
 
 "Only beguiling promises are made by K Chandrashekar Rao. Though ample issues have been pending for the last several years, the water, drainage and mosquito menaces have been a challenge in many parts of the Old City,'' added the
