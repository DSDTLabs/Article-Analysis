PATNA: Students of   (BVC) called off their 13-day old strike on Thursday after getting a written assurance from   vice-chancellor Dr A K Singh that the issues raised by them will be addressed by the university and college by May 2.

 The decision was taken following a meeting that was held between students, VC of the university and the college administration late on Wednesday evening. The two-page letter signed by the VC, registrar Dr Ashok Kumar, dean of PGs B C Saha, dean student welfare Dr S R Singh, other members of the administration and students’ representatives reads, “Normalcy will be restored on college premises from April 13 and classes as per routine will also start immediately.” The letter also mentions that no student will be victimised by the college authorities on account of the strike.
 
 The students had launched the protest on March 31 demanding hike in scholarship and fellowship, provision of drinking water in hostels and deployment of adequate number of security guards at the girls’ hostel.
 
 “The students’ representatives had a separate meeting with the VC. We got assurance that our problems will be resolved on top priority. We also urged the VC to sack college principal S   for using derogatory language against students. The VC has assured us of looking into the matter,” said  , a student representative.
 
 Samantray said the classes were conducted peacefully on Thursday. “I had a meeting with the VC on Wednesday and he has assured us that proper steps would be taken to address the issues raised by the students. As far as the hike in scholarship and fellowship is concerned, it will take some time. The university is in talks with the state government in this regard,” the principal said.
 
 He added, “I don’t understand on which ground the students are seeking my removal. If I don’t be strict with them, they’ll do whatever they like and there will be no discipline on the college premises.”
