NEW DELHI: From the last surviving model of the glamorous cardinal red V-12 Cadillac in India to an even rarer 1908   Silver Dawn from Los Angeles, automobile aficionados will get a chance to drool over   during the latest edition of the ‘21 Gun Salute Vintage Car Rally’. 

 When the entourage rolls out from India Gate on February 17, it will mark the beginning of the eighth edition of one of the largest vintage car rallies in Asia.
 
 Madan Mohan, founder and managing trustee of 21 Gun Salute Heritage Trust that organizes the rally, said: “The rally will end at   in Gurgaon, covering 33km and passing through Lutyens’ Delhi and many historic points. For two days, these vintage beauties will be stationed at the golf course.” 
 
 The event will see participation from eight countries, including the US, Britain, Italy, France, Seychelles, Singapore and Australia. The jury will comprise members from 30 countries. Suman Billa, joint secretary of ministry of tourism, said India’s motoring heritage is the our best-kept secret. “Some of the best cars in the world were procured by the maharajas and people across the world travel to see them. But we haven’t been able to capitalize on this. This is why we have lent the ‘Incredible India’ tag to it,” Billa said.
 
 The event will showcase some of the last surviving editions, such as the legendary 1939 Delage D8 120- the USA; 1922 Bentley– Australia; 1908 Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn and 1965 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud from the UK; RR Phantom James Young Edition– Singapore; 1931 Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 and GS Zagato-Aprile from Italy. Among India-based models will be 1933 Cadillac V-12, the rare 1930 Cadillac V-16 (only one in India), 1922 Moon and 1949 Buick Roadmaster. 
 
 The 1942 Packard 180 Limo is the sole survivor of the pre-world war Packards, whereas the restored 1938 Armstrong Sidley was previously owned by the maharaja of Kapurthala. Classical dance performances, such as Ghoomar from Rajasthan, Banchari from Haryana and Nagaland folk dance, will add colour to the event. The rally will also raise funds for children with special needs.
