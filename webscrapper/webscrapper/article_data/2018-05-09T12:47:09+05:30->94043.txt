PATNA: The   has issued directives to all zonal railways, including the Hajipur-headquartered   (ECR), to strictly follow summer safety measures to avert accidents due to track buckling in the extreme heat conditions these days.

 
 ECR chief public relations officer   said on Monday the   administration launched summer safety measures in all the five divisions under it this month. There will also be a team of safety personnel for round-the-clock monitoring of adherence to summer safety measures.
 
 “Vulnerable spots like bridges, curves and cross-over points are under constant surveillance. We have also initiated a move to ensure patrolling of tracks in each division to check their fitness during peak temperature hours from 11am to 4pm,” Kumar said.
 
 The engineering and traffic safety staff have been asked to also report to the traffic operation control room at the HQ of every division in case any track is found buckled.
 
 “Our safety team is equipped with skills and instruments to de-stress the buckled tracks on the spot,” Kumar said and added gang men and key men have been tasked with checking fitness of the tracks prior to movement of all passenger trains.
 
 According to sources, the ECR GM is personally monitoring summer safety measures. A summer safety cell has been made functional at the ECR HQ at   too. Senior officials have been asked to carry on ‘foot plating’ (travel on locomotives) to check safety preparedness in each division. These officials simultaneously counsel loco pilots and guards to remain vigilant on duty and follow ‘caution signals’ and speed limit restrictions.
