Badal: The Badal clan’s youngest voter, 18-year-old Aviva, exercised her franchise for the first time in the family’s village on Saturday, but has no intention to jump into politics. 

 Pursuing graduation in humanities at Hans Raj College in New Delhi, Aviva is the daughter of Herbie Badal, a cousin of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal. She was excited about casting her vote for the first time.
 
 In the 2014 parliamentary elections, Sukhbir’s daughter Harkirat Kaur had polled a vote for the first time. “Though the Badal surname is a big compliment, I am more interested in pursuing my studies and have not given any thought to joining politics. For me, it is more important that youth get quality education and proper guidance to pursue their careers. I am focused on making my career on my own and not using the surname,” says Aviva.
 
 She avoided commenting about SAD’s rival parties Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). “For me, the issues of youth are more important than indulging in politics,” she adds.
 
 She accompanied other women from the family to campaign for a couple of days for chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, her father’s uncle.
