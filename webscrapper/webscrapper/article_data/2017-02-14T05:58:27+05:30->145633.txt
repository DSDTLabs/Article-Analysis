KOCHI: Dietary cholesterol has been removed from the `naughty list' by the US department of agriculture. But, doctors here warn that for Malayalis, the problem is not really dietary cholesterol but cholesterol from food rich in saturated and trans fat.

 Over 90% of the cholesterol is made in the body and 10% of cholesterol comes from the food we consume. “The cholesterol in the body is not made from the actual dietary cholesterol that we consume but from the fats and carbohydrates that we consume, either saturated or trans-fat. Both these fats are converted into cholesterol in the body. So endogenous cholesterol is more important than dietary cholesterol,“ said Dr Praveen SV, cardiologist, KIMS, Thiruvananthapuram.
 
 “Over the past three years, there is increased debate that not all fats are bad. Just like good cholesterol and bad cholesterol, there is good and bad fat. The three main good fat in the body are the polyunsaturated fatty acids, HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) and omega fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids are bad,“ said Dr  , Sr consultant (cardiothoracic & vascular Surgery) at   in Kochi.
 
 However, doctors said that it is not advisable to presume that the dietary cholesterol is completely harmless as it contributes a bit to the body cholesterol, though not as high as the endogenous cholesterol. Moreover, some experts warn that people with particular health problems, such as diabetes, should continue to avoid cholesterolrich diets.
 
 “Most patients, especially those below 50, with heart disease come with history of familial heart disease. The family too has high cholesterol in most cases.The way the body produces cholesterol also has a genetic factor.For example, if you don't take dietary cholesterol at all but you take saturated fat, then the body converts it into cholesterol,“ said Dr  , who heads the cardiology department at   in Kochi.
