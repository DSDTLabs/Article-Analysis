Himmat Prakash usually began the day at his jewellery shop with a puja. On Sunday, as he came to the shop in Cottonpet, Bengaluru, something was amiss. He went to the safe of ornaments, and found bits of concrete and a drilling machine. In seconds, his fears were confirmed: the jewellery was missing. As he looked up, in exasperation or seeking divine help, a hole in the ceiling stared back. Above him was room 102 of the lodge on the 1st floor; its guest had checked out the evening before. 
Prakash estimated the loss at 3kg of gold and sil ver ornaments. The guest, who gave his name as Mohammed Hussain, it turned out, had submitted a fake voter ID to check in on June 19.He had drilled a hole in the floor, through 1.5ft of concrete, and made his way into the shop on Saturday.
