NAGPUR: It was the students’ complaint on December 7 last year to   (NU) that finally sealed the fate of Sunil Mishra’s   on Tuesday.

 After announcing its disaffiliation and cancellation of next year’s affiliation, vice-chancellor SP Kane provided some succour to the aggrieved students by declaring that they would be accommodated in the nearby colleges for the next academic session (2018-19).
 
 The  , mostly hailing from the lower strata of society, had lodged a complaint with NU against Mishra, accusing him of not handing over transfer certificates (TCs) to them, which was first reported by TOI in detail on December 9.
 
 While demanding to lodge an FIR against him, they claimed that the institute director’s failure to deposit their examination fees with NU led to their results and degrees being withheld. Not only they failed to seek admission in postgraduate courses, but also lost jobs in the absence of valid degree certificates.
 
 The distressed students of Bachelor of Fashion Designing (BFD) and other courses further charged him of levying different fees for same courses which was not in consonance with that prescribed by NU. They attached receipts of fees charged with their representation of demands.
 
 They further claimed that though the   students filled up the scholarship forms, Mishra didn’t pay even a penny to them till date and kept them in dark for all these years.
 
 Kane then referred the matter to registrar   and directed him to institute an enquiry into the complaints. Subsequently, a probe panel under retired industrial court judge BC Chandrikapure was constituted with MS Wankhede and deputy registrar Anil Hirekhan as members.
 
 After thorough probe, the enquiry panel recommended to lodge another FIR against Mishra for defrauding students and disaffiliating CIIMC for fraudulent practices.
