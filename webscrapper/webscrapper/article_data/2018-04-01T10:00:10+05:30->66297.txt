CHENNAI: The Tambaram regional transport office will shift to a new location where a new building will house modern facilities including an education room for licence applicants.

 The new building to be built at Rs 2 crore at  , 7km northwest of the present location on  ,   will be a two-storey building. “The ground floor will house the administrative wing and the first-floor will have an education room, a conference hall and an archive room,” Tambaram regional transport officer   told TOI. Plans are afoot also to set up a digital testing track for licence applicants on an adjoining piece of land. 
 
 Among the 10 RTOs functioning in south Chennai zone, Tambaram is the busiest, catering to nearly 1.5 lakh people living in the vicinity. On an average, the office receives more than 400 applications for driving licence and vehicle registration. The Darkas Road office has been finding it difficult to handle the increasing number of applicants. Here, hardly 30 vehicles can be parked on the premises; others are forced to park by the roadside, sometimes blocking traffic.
 
 In February, thousands of women thronged the RTO to apply for learner's licence in order to make themselves eligible for the Amma two-wheeler subsidy scheme. On many days the queues reached the main road.
 
 The government was paying a rent of Rs 60,000 for the Darkas Road premises. After a study, a team of officials of the transport and revenue departments selected a 1.5-acre piece of land at Palanthandalam, an area located on the road stretch connecting Tambaram with Kishkinta theme park.
