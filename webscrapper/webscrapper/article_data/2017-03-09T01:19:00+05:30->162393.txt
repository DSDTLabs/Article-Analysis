Panaji:The consumer disputes redressal forum, South Goa, has ordered the electricity department, Curchorem, to recalculate the bill of a consumer and issue a fresh bill.

 The forum directed the department to deduct the wrong arrears of Rs 8,429, interest on arrears and late fees calculated in the complainant’s bill.
 
 “We are at pain to observe that the arrears of Rs 8,429 should have been corrected the moment it was brought to the notice of the clerk. The concerned clerk should have been attentive and should have taken cognizance of the mistake which was highlighted by the complainant,” the forum said, adding that the present arrears kept mounting due to negligence of the concerned clerk. 
 
 A consumer approached the forum in February 2016 with a complaint stating that he was issued an electricity bill on January 4, 2014, which reflected arrears of Rs 8,429 instead of Rs 20. The electricity department attributed the inflated amount to a computer error. This amount continued to reflect in the complainant’s bill even after the department realised its error, and his net payable as on October 2016 was Rs 15,165.
 
 The forum observed that the arrears shown in the bill were improper and the bill wasn’t properly calculated and has ordered the electricity department to compute the bill as per its directions
