NEW DELHI: On May 13, Mother’s Day,   will open a room for mothers to breastfeed their children, months after a free pram service was launched to encourage more women to bring their young ones there.

 
 Renu Singh, Delhi zoo’s first female director, said that the idea was conceptualised last month keeping in mind the problems faced by women who came to the zoo with infants. “We will dedicate the room to all mothers on Mother’s Day. After this, our focus will be on the visitors’ centre where they will have all basic facilities to sit and wait,” she added.
