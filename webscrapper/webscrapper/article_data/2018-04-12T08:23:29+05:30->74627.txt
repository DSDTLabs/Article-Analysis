KENDRAPARA: The fury of climate change does not seem to spare even the gods. The relentless erosion of the sea has forced the relocation of a 400-year-old temple in Satyabhaya village of   to a village 12km away. 

 Costing 15 lakh, the framework of Ma Panchubarahi Temple was recently completed at   village. 
 
  "The temple will disappear under the advancing sea in a few months, so we decided that we must shift it at the rehabilitation colony in Bagapatia," said Kendrapara collector Reghu G.
 
 "The 1.5-tonne stone   of the temple will be installed in the new temple," added the collector.
 
 It is a crushing blow to  , the scion of the royal family of   and temple trustee. "My ancestors built this temple. We had a winter palace in  , but the sea consumed it in the 1970s. Climate change impact is likely to accelerate," Shivendra said.
 
 The endangered temple is also unique for bucking conventional tradition in its 400-year history. Men are forbidden from touching the idols and it has been only women, and those of the fishing community at that, who can become priestesses. "Our priestesses are from the scheduled castes and we respect them like the gods themselves," said Benudhar Rout, a fisherman. 
 
 Most of the 571 families of Satabhaya were recently rehabilitated by the government at Bagapatia. The remaining few live in daily fear of the one last high tide that will forever destroy their homes.
 
 The five priestesses who live inside the Panchubarahi temple stare at an equally uncertain future. "Each day, we pray before Ma Panchubarahi to save our village from the onslaught of the marching sea. But all our prayers have been in vain. When the goddess leaves, we too will leave the temple," said priestess Sujata Dalei.
