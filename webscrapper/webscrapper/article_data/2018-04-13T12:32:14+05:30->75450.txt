INDORE: The land rate in over 100 new residential colonies, which took shape during 2017-18, is yet to be decided since the new collector’s guideline for the   has not been prepared. In absence of the collector’s guideline, the stamp and   registers property in the new colonies by taking the land rate as applicable in the adjacent localities as base value. “Rate of land in 100   was to be decided for the first time in the collector’s guideline for 2018-19. However, the department of registration and stamps is waiting for state government to release instructions/guidelines deciding the land rate in different localities,” senior district registrar BK More told TOI.

 He said that the department will follow the last fiscal year’s guideline, to register property in old localities till the new guideline is published. In the new colonies, property registration is being carried out by taking base of the land’s rate as applicable in the adjacent localities. “There is no sense in taking the adjacent colonies’ land rate as base for the new colonies since property rate in even two nearby localities could differ on the basis of geographical location, amenities and other factors,” an advocate said wishing anonymity.
 
 Huge difference in the land’s rate can be seen in   and Malviya Nagar on  , Scheme 74 and Scheme 78 and in many residential colonies near Aurbindo Hospital, he added.
 
 Senior officials at the registrar department explained, “Maximum numbers of new residential colonies have developed in rural areas and there is hardly any difference between the land’s rate of new colonies and the adjacent localities. Besides, the same formula is being adopted across the state till the new guideline is issued”.
