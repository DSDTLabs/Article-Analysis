VADODARA: Three accused arrested in connection with the attempt on the life of independent councillor of Borsad municipality   were remanded to police custody for a week. Patel was shot at on January 13 at Borsad in Anand district, but he survived the attempt on his life.

 The Anti-terrorist Squad (ATS) of the state police had arrested three persons – Suresh Pillai, Ghanshyamgiri Goswami and Shabbir Momin – in connection with the case. Pillai works for underworld don Ravi Pujari in Thane and was allegedly offered a contract to kill Pragnesh.
 
 The accused were brought to Borsad on Wednesday evening and were presented before a local court on Thursday morning. The investigations in the case have now been taken over by the local crime branch of Anand police. According to the police, Pillai had shot at Pragnesh while Momin from Surat was driving the motorcycle that was used to commit the crime. Ghanshyamgiri, who lives in Borsad, had provided support to the accused in Borsad.
 
 Police said  , who had a rivalry in the cable TV business with Pragnesh, was behind the attack. Another reason for the rivalry was the fact that Chandresh’s mother Shanta Patel had been granted a BJP ticket for the   polls. Pragnesh who was denied a ticket contested the polls with an entire panel of candidates as a rebel and led to the defeat of Shanta Patel. Recently, Chandresh and Pragnesh were also involved in a scuffle.
 
 Chandresh had left the country days before the bid on Pragnesh’s life. Chandresh’s partner and another accused in the case   was admitted in a hospital days before the attack. Chandresh and Shyamgiri were involved in offences earlier, but were acquitted in trials. Shyamgiri had allegedly provided shelter to the accused during their stay in Borsad.
