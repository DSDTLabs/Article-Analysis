MUMABI: A farm loan waiver in Maharashtra will add a burden of Rs 22,000 crore on the state exchequer, revealed an estimate prepared by the cooperation department. 

 The demand for a write-off has been made by the opposition. The  , an ally of the ruling BJP, has also been pressing for the same. The issue has created a ruckus in the legislature and the House has been disrupted for the last two days.
 
 An estimate prepared by the state cooperation department, which handles disbursement, shows that the outstanding of farmers to district cooperative banks is close to Rs 9,500 crore and the figure is Rs 12,000 crore for nationalised banks. This outstanding has been a cumulative of the last three years. However, officials say a loan waiver will have many riders.
 
 Barring 2016, the state has seen three consecutive years of drought, which has led to restructuring of loans and also disbursement of fresh credit. Despite adequate rainfall and a good harvest in 2016, loan repayments have been affected as the prices of produce have dipped due to overproduction.
 
 “There has been a lot of issues with farmers getting fresh loans, considering that more than 60% of them have been unable to repay the entire loan amount,” said a senior official from the cooperation department.
 
 “The state government wants to help the farmers reduce their loans and not give loan waivers to help banks or private money lenders,” state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. 
 
 The Congress-NCP state government had in 2009 granted a loan waiver package.
