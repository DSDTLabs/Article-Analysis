VARANASI: A war of words broke out between state cabinet ministers on Monday with health minister   reacting sharply against allegations of Om   about increase in corruption and most backward population still being deprived of its rights in UP. Rajbhar had also threatened to resign.

 Talking to reporters at circuit house, Singh said that   has come to power to ensure development. He said that the work of Yogi government is being noticed abroad too and investors from developed countries are showing interest to invest in UP.
 
 Speaking on Kasganj incident, Siddharthnath Singh said that the situation is fast turning normal and the government is doing its best. He targeted Samajwadi Party’s appeasement politics and said that in its regime no FIR could be lodged against a particular section of society.
 
 Earlier, Singh inspected the SPG divisional hospital, DDU district hospital and health centres in the district. In a show of strength on Sunday, Rajbhar had held the state government, district administration and police responsible for Kasganj violence.
 
 Interestingly, Rajbhar also said that he is only warning the government and again clarified that he would not break his party’s alliance with BJP.
