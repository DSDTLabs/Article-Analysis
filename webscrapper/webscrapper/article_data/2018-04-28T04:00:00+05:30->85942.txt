Rajkot: Some miscreants are trying to disrupt the peace in Kutch district that has enjoyed communal harmony over the years. Five dargahs (shrines) and few idols of Hindu gods have been targeted in the last four months in different talukas of India’s largest district. Three dargahs were damaged in Abdasa taluka’s Suthri, Motha and Bhavanipar villages. The ‘chaddars’ of two dargahs in Sinai village of Anjar taluka were set on fire. Some miscreants also broke lord Shiva’s idols a week ago in Bhuj. Moreover, three days ago, some idols of Hindu gods and goddess were found broken in a crematorium of Rajgor community. A Muslim leader in Bhuj Juma Rayma said, “Some of the dargahs, which were ransacked like one in Bhavanipar, are run by Hindus. Kutch is enjoying communal harmony since long and even during 2002 riots the district remained peaceful. But some miscreants are trying to create disharmony. We have requested the police to identify these elements and take strict action against them.”
