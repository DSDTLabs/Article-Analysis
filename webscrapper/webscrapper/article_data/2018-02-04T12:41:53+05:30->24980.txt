PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   government will stop grants under Swachh Bharat Mission 2018 if cities and towns do not segregate 80% of   by April.

 While Pimpri Chinchwad segregates 30% of its garbage, it is unlikely that it would be able to achieve the target of 80% by April, senior civic officials said.
 
 Two small garbage buckets have been distributed to over 4.5 lakh households. Over 600 autorickshaws, which have separate compartments for carrying dry and wet waste, reach out to every residential locality.
 
 The government is taking various efforts to improve cleanliness rankings in cities and towns under the Maharashtra Swacch Bharat Mission. However, some cities have not responded to the state government’s appeal. For improving cleanliness rankings, the state government has decided to stop grants if they do not segregate garbage by April. The state government has asked cities to segregate wet garbage and use it for composting.
 
 The civic body had started garbage segregation on World Environment Day (June 5) last year. 
 
 “Most households do not segregate garbage due to lack of public awareness. Garbage collectors on auto rickshaws segregate 30% of garbage,” officials said. In the 2018 survey, the focus would be on garbage management (collection, transportation, processing & disposal), education, among others.
 
 The state has also told cities to be open defecation free. PCMC has built over 8,500 toilets in slums. “We will construct 15,000 more toilets next year,” municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said.
