NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday detained a woman who tried to extort Rs 5 crore from a Lok Sabha MP. 

 "She will be questioned at length. We need to verify certain things," said Delhi Police. The woman was arrested from her home in Ghaziabad, the police said.

 A day after TOI reported about an FIR filed by the Lok Sabha MP alleging an extortion bid of Rs 5 crore, Delhi Police on Monday identified the woman.

 The woman herself has alleged that she was first raped by KC Patel, the MP from Valsad in Gujarat, at his official residence on March 3 when he invited her for dinner. "I was raped multiple times by Patel. I had to make a CD as evidence so that he stops threatening me," she said.
 
 While the woman had alleged that the MP raped her on several occasions, Patel claimed he was drugged and obscene videos and photos were shot by her.
 
 Patel had alleged the woman invited him to a place in Ghaziabad for some work where she offered him a soft drink which was laced with sedatives, police said.
