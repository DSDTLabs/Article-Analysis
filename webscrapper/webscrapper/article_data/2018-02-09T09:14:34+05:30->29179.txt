LUCKNOW: By defying the repeated warnings by   and CM   for running the House smoothly, particularly during the joint address by the governor, SP chief   has thrown an open challenge to act against his party. Now, it is to be seen whether the Speaker, who has from different platforms, been pleading and cautioning the Opposition not to cross the “Laxmanrekha” would act against the Opposition, mainly the SP and the   for unconstitutional and unruly behaviour?

 Dixit has strongly condemned the behavior of the SP MLAs and other Opposition members saying that governor had been stopped from discharging his Constitutional duty and it is a serious matter. Dixit has been saying that a spontaneous heated discussion or even slogan-shouting during discussion in the House was natural and acceptable, but carrying placards, banners or any other such materials smacks of a pre-planned strategy and a conspiracy to disrupt the house which would not be tolerated. The Speaker, who had been hurt by the Opposition’s behaviour had let off the Opposition with a warning in the last session that they would invite action if it would be repeated. But the Opposition has indicated a more stiff confrontation in the days to come.
