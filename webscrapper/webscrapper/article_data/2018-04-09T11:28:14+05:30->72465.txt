PUNE: The Wakad police on Sunday arrested a 30-year-old criminal for driving a woman to jump off the first floor balcony of her flat in   early on Thursday after he forced his way into her house and tried to molest her. She sustained a leg fracture.

 The suspect, Kishor Dnyandev   of Thergaon, was earlier arrested in cases of murder and drug peddling. Shelar was released on bail earlier this year, police said.
 
 Senior inspector   of Wakad police told TOI, “The woman and her husband had gone to a hotel for dinner on Wednesday night. “At the hotel, a man, who appeared to be in his early 20s, stole her cellphone, and her husband started chasing him. During the chase, her husband met Shelar, who told him he knew the youth and would get the cellphone back from him on Thursday. Shelar then took the couple to their residence.
 
 After reaching their residence, her husband offered a drink to Shelar and the two men went to a bar. They returned around 2am on Thursday. “Shelar dropped the husband to his house and instead of leaving the place, he locked it from the inside,” Mane said. The suspect then pulled out a knife and issued threats of dire consequences to the woman. He demanded money and the woman hastily ran towards balcony and jumped off, Mane added.
