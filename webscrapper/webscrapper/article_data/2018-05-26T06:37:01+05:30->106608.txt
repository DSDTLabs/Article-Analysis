HYDERABAD: Light to moderate rainfall lashed the city early on Friday bringing down the maximum temperature from 41 degree Celsius to 39.9 degree Celsius during morning hours. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature is 25.7 degree Celsius.

 Incidents of hailstorm were also reported from few areas. Breezy and cloudy weather prevailed in the city during evening hours with brief spells of rain reported from some areas. 
 
 Meteorologists attribute the sudden downpour during the night to trough extending from Vidarbha to South   across Telangana and Rayalaseema. "Light to moderate rains will continue to lash in all districts of Telangana," said Raja Rao, meteorologist at   (IMD), Hyderabad.
 
 The IMD, Hyderabad, has also issued a thunderstorm warning accompanied with gusty winds for all parts of Telangana. 
 
 Private weather forecasting agencies predict that the intensity of rain may increase around month-end and scattered rains may occur leading to some relief. 
 
 "A trough was passing through the central parts of the country to interior   across Telangana. In the wake of this, Hyderabad recorded some rains. But now this trough has weakened and is extending from north interior Karnataka to Tamil Nadu which is why rains reduced. However, this trough is expected to develop over the region once again during the month-end," states the weather report issued by Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.
