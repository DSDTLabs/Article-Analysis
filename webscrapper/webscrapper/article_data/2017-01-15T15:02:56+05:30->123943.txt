I am a 22-year-old working woman and in a relationship since past three years. I want to get married to my boyfriend but the problem is that he is very possessive and doesn't allow me to talk to any of my male friends. For each and everything, I have to listen to him and even dress as per his wish; otherwise he gets angry and shouts at me. In fact, he doesn't give me any personal space but says that he loves me a lot. I can interact only with the people he likes. All these things are making me very confused about him. He doesn't like my female friends also. Sometimes, he abuses me and threatens to leave me if I donâ€™t act according to his will.
 
  I am a bit confused. Please help me to take a proper decision. 
 
  
  
 It would be worthwhile making a list of qualities that you like and the ones that you don't about your boyfriend. Encourage him to do the same for you. Start a dialogue about it. What seems like possessiveness before marriage becomes domination after marriage. We all are slightly possessive about the people we are close to, but that doesn't mean we start to dictate their choices. Think very carefully before you say your ' I do'. Good luck!
