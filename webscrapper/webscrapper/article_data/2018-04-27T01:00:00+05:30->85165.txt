While it’s known that   will begin shooting for   with Siva in Hyderabad at Ramoji studio, we hear there’s a special reason for it. A source says, “Ajith had kick-started some of his movies, including Siva’s   and  , at the same studio in Hyderabad, and he has some fond memories associated with the place. He’s quite sentimental about it, and that’s one of the reasons why the team decided to start the first schedule of the film there.” Interestingly, all of Ajith’s films with Siva have titles that start with V – Veeram, Vedhalam,  , and now Viswasam.

 The film, which has Nayanthara teaming up with the actor again, will go on floors on May 7. The source adds, “The team is creating a village set there; work that had been stopped owing to the strike in Kollywood has resumed and the set will be ready by the weekend. This will be a 30-day schedule and most of the cast will be present. Ajith has worked on his physique and will be sporting a look that’s different from what he was seen in, in his last few films.”
