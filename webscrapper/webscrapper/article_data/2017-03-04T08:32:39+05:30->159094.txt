DUBAI:  , who's triumphing on big tennis platforms at 35, says victories and love of the fans are what keep sport legends going late in their career.

 Federer's career parallels that of the now-retired  , with whom the Swiss star shares a unique friendship.
 
 Federer, who clinched 18th Grand Slam title in Melbourne in January, tells TOI nothing succeeds like success. "It could be a goal you're chasing, a number, a ranking. It could be certain tournaments you still want to win. It could be all of that - or just the sheer joy of playing."
 
 "That alone doesn't cut it for me," the father of four says. "I've had too much success in my younger years for that. You can't keep losing in the first round every week and pretend you're super happy. You need tournament victories, you need things happening for yourself."
 
 In his retirement speech a little over three years ago, Tendulkar had said wife Anjali was "the best partnership" of his life. Federer seconds that: "It's the same for me. I always play on centre court, I play during the best times of the day, the nicest tournaments around the globe. That part of motivation is always easy. The question, then, is: 'How much are you willing to do at practice? How easy or difficult is it for you?' For me, it's quite easy," he says.
 
 "I've a great team around me - coaches who set up the right practice sessions, a fitness coach with whom I don't almost have to think, I just do, and a great physio whose lead I have to only follow. All that makes it so much easier."
