Although   has played a dual role in the 2016 hit  , shooting for   proved to be a different proposition altogether. “That’s because I never did scenes where both characters were in the same frame together. In this film, the two characters, Krishna and Arjun are together for almost half the duration. It involved shooting a lot in front of motion control cameras. The most challenging bit was switching from one character to the other instantly on cue. it was mentally draining, but I’m pleased with the way it turned out,” says the actor.
Talking about the characters, Nani adds, “They are completely different from each other. Krishna is from   jilla and speaks with a peculiar accent. He thinks he’s a great flirt, but no one 
 really takes him seriously, especially the women. When a woman enters his life and something goes amiss, he has to go to Hyderabad for her. Arjun, on the other hand, is everything Krishna is not. he’s a classy and edgy rockstar from Prague. What brings these two together and for what purpose is what the film is all about. Besides the two love stories, the film packs in lots of fun and action episodes as well.” Apparently, while Nani relied on 
 director Gandhi’s vision to get into the skin of Krishna, he followed his gut to play Arjun. “Gandhi is from Chittoor, so he knows the accent, body language and the 
 intricacies of the people there inside out. When in doubt, I would make him say the lines and pick up the diction. But for Arjun, I relied on my instincts. When Gandhi narrated the story to me, I had an idea as to what the character would be like. I recreated the image I had in my head to play him,” he says, signing off.
