 is acing his Twitter game and how! The actor, who is busy shooting for Imtiaz Ali’s yet untitled project, recently shared an interesting video on his social media account. The video sees a Turkish ice cream seller doing quite a few antics and teasing his customer before handing out an ice cream to her. And all the while, you can hear Shah Rukh’s chartbuster ‘Gerua’ playing in the background.

 The quick-witted man that   is, he had quite a funny take on it. The actor posted the video with the message, “Would’ve shot   with ice cream instead of going to   had I seen this earlier... Awesome.” 
 
 We are sure you will be as mesmerised by the ice cream vendor’s antics as   himself.
