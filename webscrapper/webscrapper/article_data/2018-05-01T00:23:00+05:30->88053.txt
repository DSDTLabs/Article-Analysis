Bhopal: Ahead of the strike called by outsourced and contractual employees of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here, the institute administration claimed it would not hinder the patient services. Projecting control over the situation, AIIMS administration released snapshots of email from All Employees Association of AIIMS Bhopal (AEAAB) president and nursing staff (temporary, contractual and outsourced) over their disassociation from the day-long strike from 8 am to 1 pm on Tuesday. “When the matter is already under consideration, as assured by joint secretary PMSSY, they should keep patience instead of going for half-day protest on May 1, as announced by Vijay Badle. However, adequate arrangements have been made by hospital administration for the smooth operation and uninterrupted hospital patient care services,” said AIIMS Bhopal deputy director (administration), Santosh Sohgaura. He also stated that neither he nor the institute’s financial advisor were on leave.  A notice citing Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), to ensure the delivery of services, was also put in the public domain by the hospital administration. It came after AEAAB president Sanjeev Dubey was summoned along with the other association for an emergency meeting on Monday. The proposed strike call comes in the wake of lack of clarity on status of mostly non-clinical employees of AIIMS, Bhopal, who seek regularisation. AIIMS hospital caters to over 2,000 OPD patients every0 day and the administration claimed that it was confident that hospital services would not be impacted.  There are around 600 contractual and outsourced employees in AIIMS, Bhopal. If the strike comes about, it would be first by contractual employees and a first since the institute was established in 2012. Bhopal AIIMS was one of six new AIIMS-like institutes established by union government to improve and provide health services.
