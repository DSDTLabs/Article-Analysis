Surat: The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) announced the appointment of its new chairman and vice-chairman after the results of counting of votes for the election held on Friday.  Pramod Agarwal was appointed chairman of GJEPC and Colin Shah vice-chairman for the term 2017-19. Agarwal will take over the reins from outgoing chairman Praveenshanker Pandya.  Former chairman of GJEPC Vipul Shah was contesting against Pramod Agarwal, but lost with a margin of 350 votes. The GJEPC has around 1,800 voting members from across the country. Pramod Agarwal, who is chairman of Jaipur-based Derewala Group, is constantly working towards fulfilling his dream of providing international quality products with emphasis on value for money. After having won encomiums across the globe for over two decades, he expanded the group’s business into the Indian market. Besides being dedicatedly involved in the business and its operations, he spends his time working with jewellery trade associations for the overall benefit of the industry. He is chairman of Indian Institute of Gem and Jewellery, Jaipur (a project of GJEPC). He is also a member of committee of administration (COA) of GJEPC, member of board of directors of All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation (GJF) and an executive member of Jewellers Association, Jaipur. “My emphasis would be on facilitating a stable taxation for diamond through presumptive taxation, reduction on Goods and Service Tax rate for cut and polished diamonds and colour gemstones. GST rate on gold and silver, too, needs to be withdrawn for export purposes. Me and my team would also work towards exploring new resources of raw diamonds and colour gemstones while streamlining their consistent supply. Generic diamond promotion is a must for the industry. Hand-crafted jewellery industry, too, needs to be strengthened,” the new chairman said.
