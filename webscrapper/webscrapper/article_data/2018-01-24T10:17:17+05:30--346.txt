NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the plea filed by the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh governments to stall the public screening of ' ', set for release on January 25, and directed them to take all steps to maintain law and order in view of threats by Rajput groups like Karni Sena. 

 After the court cleared the countrywide release of the controversial film last week and restrained states from any ban, Rajasthan and MP governments rushed to the SC saying they had the right to suspend its public screening if it disturbed law and order. 
 
  Additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the MP government, told a bench of CJI Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud the state was committed to the freedom of speech and expression of artists, but the film's release would create a law and order problem. Mehta said he was not seeking relief beyond constitutional parameters, and referred to Section 5 (b) of the Cinematograph Act, which says a film shall not be certified for public exhibition if any part is likely to create a law and order problem. 
 
 
 
 
 With a day to go for the release of 'Padmaavat', Maharashtra tourism and employment guarantee scheme minister Jaykumar Rawal, who belongs to the Rajput community, called upon the people to boycott the movie. His appeal is in sharp contrast to the state's government's assurance to the theatres for 'peaceful' release of the movie. "I will never watch it and will also appeal to people in my personal capacity to not watch the film," said Rawal on Tuesday. P
