Pune: The NCP and the MNS corporators on Monday demanded formation of a special cell to speed up the land acquisition for the Katraj-Kondhwa road. “The acquisition has not been done according to the requirement. At least 70% land should be acquired before starting the work on the ground. Funds for the land acquisition should be made available,” Dattatraya Dhankawade, former mayor of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) told reporters. In March 2018, officials of the accounts department of the state government had objected to the tendering process for this road. They had expressed their displeasure over the acquisition process.  The road is expected to be built spending over Rs700 crore, including the funds for the land acquisition. The construction cost would be around Rs215 crore. The tenders of the road were mired in controversy because of high price quoted by the bidders and objections to the process.
