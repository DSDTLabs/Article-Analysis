Indore: A huge fire broke out at a godown at JNT market on Dhar road early on Sunday morning and continued for several hours before it could be doused. The fire reportedly destroyed scrap that was stored.

 The blaze continued till morning before it could be put out.
 
 The fire was triggered at a godown owned by Tej Singh after someone threw a burning stick inside, which triggered the fire. However, police could not confirm this.
 
 One fire tender was rushed to the spot soon after the fire broke out. After a while, two more fire tenders were sent and were engaged in bringing the fire under control for a long time.
 
 “The fire could not be controlled for some time. It took several tankers and foam to douse the flames. It continued for several hours and gutted the entire godown. The high flames could be seen from far away,” said Anjana Tiwari, ASP, fire department.
 
 Smoke continued to billow till afternoon and fire fighters were engaged in keeping a check on the area to avoid any untoward incident. The owner of the godown was also present and claimed he had suffered a huge loss. Meanwhile, several people had gathered at the spot to witness the incident.
 
 In the last few years, several fire incidents have been reported at Guru Nanak Timber Market on Dhar Road.
 
 The market has over 150 shops and very few arrangements have been made to deal with fires should they occur. Some residential colonies are located dangerously close to the market.
 
 In a fire reported here five months ago, two shops were gutted in which wooden material, furniture, machines, motorcycles and other goods worth lakhs of rupees were destroyed. An LPG gas cylinder, which was kept in a shop, had exploded but nobody was injured.
