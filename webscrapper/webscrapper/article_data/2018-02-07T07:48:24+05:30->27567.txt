INDORE: Relatives of an elderly   on Tuesday accused   staff of transfusing blood of a different group to him while he was admitted there for surgery.

 The hospital confirmed that blood of a different group was inadvertently brought for transfusion, but said that the procedure was not started due to the mismatch.
 
 Pankaj Verma, grandson of Ramadhar Verma, told reporters that his grandfather had been admitted to the hospital on January 20 as he was suffering from kidney ailment and was discharged five days later after transfusion of O+ve blood.
 
 As per doctor’s advice, the patient was again brought to the hospital for health checkup on Monday. “After examining patient’s health, the doctor planned a surgery for next day (Tuesday) and as such, he required blood transfusion again,” Pankaj said.
 
 “It was only after my grandfather complained of uneasiness did the staff notice that he was being given ‘B+ve’ blood instead of his group ‘O+ve,’ he said.
 
 “As per hospital records, about 5-10ml blood of B+ve group was transfused to the patient, before the process was stopped. He was later shifted to intensive care unit,” Pankaj said.
 
 Hospital spokesman Rahul Parashar refuted the allegations, claiming that the patient underwent a prostate surgery later in the day. “This could not have been possible if wrong blood had been given to him,” he said.
 
 “The blood had mistakenly come to the patient’s room but it was noticed and changed before transfusion,” Parashar said. He said that the patient’s does not have symptoms of having been given wrong blood.
