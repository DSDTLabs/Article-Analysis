GHAZIABAD: At least 350 wrist watches were stolen from a store dealing exclusively in Titan products in the upscale Rajnagar District Centre of Ghaziabad on Wednesday morning. The burglary, committed by five men, has been captured on   cameras installed at the store.

 
 The exact quantum of loss has not been determined yet. However, police sources said it could easily run into several lakhs.
 
 The burglary took place in   store located in the heart of the busy commercial sector. On the basis of CCTV footage, police suspect burglars entered the store between 4.30 am and 5 am.
 
 Store proprietor, Ashok Daga, told TOI that a total of four CCTV cameras are installed both outside and inside the premises. According to Daga, the store was closed the previous night at around 10 pm by two of his employees.
 
 “Five men could be seen arriving at the store around 4.30 am. They hadn’t covered their faces. They used a rod to force open the shutter. Two men entered the store while the remaining moved away from the entrance. The two men emerged from the store with their booty around 30 minutes later. Their accomplices returned to the entrance too. They make off with their booty. The CCTV footage hasn’t captured the vehicle, if any, which was used by the burglars. The exact cost of the burgled watches can be ascertained only after we finish cross-checking our stock,” said Daga.
 
 Police questioned store employees on Wednesday after taking the CCTV footage into possession. Security guards on night duty in nearby stores as well as policemen on patrol were also quizzed.
 
 An FIR has been registered against unidentified persons in   police station under Section 380 (theft) of IPC.
 
 “An insider hand is suspected. The shutter had been bolted and locked from either ends. However, the burglars thrust the rod right below the centre. They took advantage of the squall and dust storm during the dawn to commit the burglary,” said SHO, Kavi Nagar, Samarjeet Singh.
