Chandigarh: It seems that in the name making Chandigarh ‘smart’, the green heritage of the city is being compromised; and the UT administration do not have any say on this.

 A TOI team found that the roots of trees at various spots, where cycle tracks are to be made, have been exposed and damaged due to digging. Not only this, there are a lot of places where the roots have been completely uprooted from one side.
 
 The city environmentalists have said that this is dangerous as the trees with weak roots pose a threat to both life and property.
 
 “Construction of cycle tracks is crucial for the development. However, instead of digging the entire city at once, the administration should have done this in a phased manner,” said, a city-based environment expert  .
 
 “While digging, the officials completely ignored the trees. And now, the digging has damaged the growth ecosystem of the trees. They should have taken help of the horticulture department,” Mahajan added
 
 “The civil department needs to take a lot of care to save trees or they would die early. They can also fall in the long run and with strong winds or storm it may happen sooner,” said chief conservator at the department of forest and wildlife, Chandigarh administration  .
 
 “They should not have damaged the tree roots. These trees were the responsibility of the administration and the  ,” he added.
 
 “The engineering wing could have consulted the experts to know if this kind of digging could do any kind of damage,” said founder member Chandigarh Tree Lovers Rajnish Wattas.
 
 UT chief engineer   did not comment on the issue.
