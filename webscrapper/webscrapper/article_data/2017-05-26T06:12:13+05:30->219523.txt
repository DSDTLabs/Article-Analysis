Director   said his upcoming historical war drama ' ' required the backdrop of the Indo-Sino war and even though the film is set in '62s, it is relevant even today. 

 When asked if the makers chose China war as the backdrop instead of Pakistan to avoid controversy, Salman jokingly said, "Release 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' again."
 
 Khan interrupted saying the story of 'Tubelight' demanded the 1962 war backdrop.

 "Every story requires a certain background and timeline. 'Tubelight' required this film to be set in 1962. But there are other elements in the story. It's a relevant story even in today's time but we can't reveal everything now." 
 
 The 'Dabangg' star said 'Tubelight' is the story of two brothers essayed by him and  . 
 
 "Basically this story is about two brothers. One brother goes to war and other stays back and prays for the war to end so that his brother can come back. Now, whether his belief can actually bring back his brother or not is what the story is about," Salman said.
