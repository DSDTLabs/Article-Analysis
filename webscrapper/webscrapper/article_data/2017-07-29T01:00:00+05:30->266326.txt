DARBHANGA: The Lalit Narayan Mithila University ( ) is set to be declared fully digital university.

 LNMU VC Professor Surendra Kumar Singh said on Friday that the university, apart from online admissions, is to introduce biometric attendance for teachers and non-teaching staff in most of its 43 constituent colleges on its 45th foundation day on August 5. 
 
 The LNMU has also made preparations for e-pathshala in PG departments of science subjects. “There will be one coordinator in each science department to collect course material from the faculties and uploaded it to the university website, which will have a hyperlink for students to access course materials,” Singh said. 
 
 “There will be no facility for downloading the course material. E-pathshala will be available to the students soon,” he added. 
 
 The varsity has also asked the newly appointed assistant professors of English, philosophy, Maithili, psychology and economics to submit their research proposals. “After scrutiny, the proposals found suitable would be forwarded to the funding agency,” he said. 
 
 The university is also planning to organise its alumni meet and a mega skill centre. The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) has been approached for that, he said. TNN
