NEW DELHI: Relatives of the girl who was allegedly raped by Uttar Pradesh minister Gayatri   have accused him and his aides of threatening the survivor and her kin. The relatives of the girl alleged that a UP police officer, who had come to   to record the survivor’s statement, threatened to kill them in a fake encounter. They have filed a complaint with the Delhi police over the alleged threats.

 In a complaint filed at the Hauz Khas police station, a relative alleged that a DSP-rank woman officer of the UP police on Thursday barged into the AIIMS ward where the 16-year-old girl was admitted. The officer threatened the relatives and snatched their mobile phones. “The officer pushed the girl and pestered the mother to record the statement. When we objected to it, the officer threatened to get us killed in a fake encounter,” alleged the complainant, who claimed to be a cousin of the teenage survivor.
 
 Chinmoy Biswal, additional DCP (south), confirmed that the complaint was filed by the survivor’s relative. Prajapati has been declared absconding.
