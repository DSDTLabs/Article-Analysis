After  's Twitter rant on Friday, where he slammed filmmaker   (RGV) to orchestrate his abuse by   on the streets of Hyderabad,   hit back saying that he had already apologies for his actions and stated that the Power Star's allegations were misplaced. 

 Sharing a video of Pawan Kalyan in a huddle with his lawyers, the filmmaker tweeted, "I just pray 
  won’t come under contempt of the courts for making a mockery of lawyers and lawyers won’t put a defamation case on him for making them look like junior artistes (sic)."
 
 RGV also sarcastically quipped that the lawyers look more like a group of fans, who are just staring while Pawan Kalyan does the talking. 
 "Wowwww first time I saw a client talking more than lawyers..I wonder why with all his money he couldn’t hire better lawyers or are they just his fans wearing lawyer coats from their film production Godown...just asking (sic)," he tweeted. 
 
 Pawan Kalyan had earlier alleged that there was a nexus between politicians and media barons, which has orchestrated the abuse of him and his mother on the streets of Hyderabad. Pawan alleged that RGV too was part of this nexus. 
 
 Reactingly sharply, the filmmaker tweeted, " Nenu chesina paniki Sorry cheppi Pk meedha ika comment cheyyanani maa mother meeda vottesanu ..aa tharvatha kooda nenu Cbn ,Lokesh Srini Raju Rk Ravi Prakash Moorthy kootami lo vunnanani aaropinchadam moolana maa mother angeekaaram tho ippud naa vottu theesi gattu meedha pettanu (I had apologised to Pawan and swore on my mother that I won't comment anything against him in the future. However, in light of these new allegations, I have taken permission from my mother and have thrown my promise to the ground."
