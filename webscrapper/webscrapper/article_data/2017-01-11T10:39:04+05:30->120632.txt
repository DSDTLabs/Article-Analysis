CHHAPRA: The rail route bewteen   and Mashrakh railway stations saw a train chug off after a gap of 20 months with a passenger train being flagged off from Chhapra Kutchery at 6.15am on Tuesday. 

 Rail traffic on this section was suspended on April 1, 2015 to pave way for the conversion of meter gauge track to broad gauge. According to railway sources, the conversion work has been completed up to Thawe station. But the railways has decided to ply trains only up to Mashrakh in the first phase. 
 
 “We were expecting resumption of train movement on the section in December after the CRS (commissioner of railway safety) inspected the newly laid track and gave the go-ahead to the railways to operate between Chhapra Kutchery and Mashrakh,” a railway official said, adding the resumption of train movement was somehow delayed.
 
 Ramesh Kumar and Rupesh Kumar were the loco pilots while Prem Nath Singh was the guard on the train on the inaugural run, which reached Mashrakh at 8am.
 
  secretary Pawan Kumar Agrawal expressed happiness over the resumption of train services on this section. “I hope and pray the railways introduces more trains up to Thawe and later up to New Delhi via   through this route,” he told TOI.
 
 According to Agrawal, this rail section caters to a large number of people, including daily wage earners.
