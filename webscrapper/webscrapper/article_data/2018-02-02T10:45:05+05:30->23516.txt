PUNE: About 2.5 lakh newly diagnosed as well as drug-resistant   patients will be able to avail direct   of Rs 500 per month during the entire course of treatment in   under the Union government’s newly announced nutritional support scheme.

  minister   on Thursday announced budgetary provision of Rs 600 crore for TB patients in India for 2018-19. Maharashtra is likely to get about Rs 43 crore from this country-wide allocation, state health officials said. 
 
 The scheme aims at improving treatment outcome, reducing relapses, increasing survival rate. It is going to be pivotal to the government’s plan to eliminate TB by 2025, experts said. “The direct cash benefit will also act as an incentive to complete treatment and reduce number of treatment defaulters,” state tuberculosis officer   said.
 
 In Maharashtra, nutritional support scheme was started as a pilot project in 2014-15 and later funds were also allocated to municipal corporations under   (NUHM) for TB patients.
 
 Initially, there was a lot of debate over providing cooked or uncooked food. After deliberations, the Centre decided to transfer direct cash benefit to patients’ accounts every month till the full course of treatment.
 
 “Basal metabolic rate of TB patients is around 15% more than healthy individuals. Hence, nutritional support is crucial to improve treatment outcome and reduce mortality,”  , consultant for state TB programme, said.
 
 Nutritional support improves patients’ immunity and helps in early recovery from the disease. “It also helps in preventing relapses,” Bharaswadkar added.
