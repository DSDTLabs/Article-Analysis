HYDERABAD: In what could be a Telugu New Year (Ugadi) shocker, lakhs of residents received hefty water bills this month in excess of their routine payments. Consumers, who used to pay Rs 250-300, have been asked to cough up Rs 1,000-1,200. Several of them were caught off guard as the Hyderabad Metropolitan   (HMWSSB) defended its move, saying that those who have not fixed water meters despite repeated pleas are being penalised.

 
 There are 9.30 lakh water consumers as per the board’s records and a whopping six lakh are yet to fix the water meters. A consumer (CAN NO 062253389) of Fatehnagar in Kukatpally was slapped with a bill of Rs 1,100. He says his monthly bill had never crossed Rs 250.
 
 
 When contacted, a senior official told TOI that they were forced to levy twice the amount on the bill. “The charges have doubled along with water and sewerage cess,” the official explained. Till February, the water board had issued bills to the ‘unmetered’ consumers by collecting the minimum charges of Rs 250 per month. In fact, out of the six lakh consumers, two lakh are categorised as slum dwellers who are exempted from fixing the water meters.
 
 
 While the consumers are feeling the pinch, the board claimed that the consumers were warned through  , publicity material and media campaigns about fixing the meters. “We had extended the deadlines but in vain,” another official said, pointing out that only 10,000 consumers had installed the meters. As a last resort to get the meters fixed, the board had even announced a 5% discount in the monthly bills.
 
 
 The board spends Rs 45 per kilolitre and charges Rs 10 to supply the quantity of water to domestic consumers. The meters are available in all the water board circle offices across the city.
