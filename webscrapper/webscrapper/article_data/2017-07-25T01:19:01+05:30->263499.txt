CHHAPRA: Union minister and Saran MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy on Sunday said tussle between coalition partners JD(U) and RJD over deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has adversely affected the state’s development.   The JD(U) has been demanding Tejashwi’s explanation over the corruption charges made by the CBI in its FIR lodged against him and his mother and former CM Rabri Devi in the land-for-railways hotels deal when his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad was the rail minister.    Talking to newsmen at Bhawalpur under Amnour police station area in Saran district, Rudy said, “The coalition partners are pulling each other’s legs just to divert the people’s attention from development.”    Lashing out at the state government for non-cooperation in implementing the Union government’s schemes, Rudy said construction of 163km-long road from Saraiya to Balmikinagar via Taraiya, Gopalganj, has been sanction by the Centre at an estimated cost of Rs8,000 crore, but work could not be started as the state failed to issue no-objection certificate.    He also criticised the state government for its failure to make the state free from open defecation as human excreta could be seen on both sides of the road leading to his house in Amnour. Expressing his anguish, Rudy asked the officials to get the area cleaned.
