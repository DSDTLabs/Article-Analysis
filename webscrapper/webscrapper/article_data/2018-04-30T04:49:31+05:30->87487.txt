NEW DELHI: The last couple of weeks before Karnataka votes for a new assembly on May 12 will see BJP's three top campaigners — Prime Minister Modi,   chief   and Uttar Pradesh CM   — criss-cross the state in an attempt to overthrow the Siddaramaiah government.

 Modi is expected to address at least 15 rallies in the state, while Shah will address 30 and Adityanath 20 rallies, party sources said. However, they added that the number of rallies of the others except the Prime Minister could vary in accordance with the need. 
 
 With less than two weeks left before campaigning ends on May 10, party functionaries are waiting for the star central campaigners to create the right atmosphere for the electioneering in the state where the fight is seen a straight faceoff between BJP and  .
 
 Shah has been camping in the state for the last one week and is likely to remain there till the end of campaigning as Karnataka is the only state going for polls this time and for BJP, it is the strongest southern state. The party is not leaving any stone unturned in its bid to regain power in the state which was the first one in the south to see a BJP government.
 
 Modi, who continues to be BJP's biggest draw as a campaigner, has usually tilted people's support for the party in the last leg of any poll campaign. He is expected to weave his magic in the last two weeks with about 15 rallies listed in his name, in an election that is expected to set the mood for next year's big battle.
 
 The saffron-clad Adityanath has already been on a Karnataka campaign trail in BJP strongholds before nominations were filed, but he too is expected to charge up the atmosphere just before polling day, so that the Hindutva factor plays its part to BJP's advantage.
