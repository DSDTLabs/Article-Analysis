CHENNAI: A Central Industrial Security Force ( ) constable who went on a shooting spree and killed three of his colleagues and injured two others at the   (MAPS) complex in Kalpakkam off Chennai four years ago, was awarded triple life sentence by a district court.

 K Ramanathan, additional district judge, Chengelpet, further sentenced the constable Vijay   for 10 years rigorous imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 15,000 on him while announcing his verdict.
 
 On October 8, 2014, Vijay Pratap Singh reported to work early in the morning. Around 4.50am, he had collected his service rifle and walked to the first floor of the barracks where CISF head constable  , 57, of Jahangirpur, Rajasthan, was sleeping and shot him dead.
 
 He then walked downstairs to the portico and opened fire at CISF personnel who were preparing for the morning shift, killing assistant sub-inspector R Ganesan, 58, of Thalavaipatti near Salem, and head constable A Subburaj, 54, of Virudhunagar in the melee. 
 
 Two other personnel- assistant sub-inspector Pratap Singh, 57, of Uttarakhand, and head constable  , 42, of Jammu and Kashmir, were injured in the firing, before other members of the unit restrained  .
 
 Around 620 CISF personnel headed by a commandant were stationed at the DAE Kalpakkam unit. They are responsible for the security of MAPS. Thirty of them are accommodated at the bachelorsâ€™ barrack where the shootout happened while the others were provided accommodation at quarters within the township.
 
 Preliminary enquiries by the Kalpakkam police who arrested him suggested that Vijay Pratap Singh was under stress. 
 
 He was a native of Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. He had fired 20 rounds from his self-loading automatic rifle before he was eventually restrained by his colleagues. 
 
 After years of trial, the case came for its final hearing on Monday when the Judge pronounced his verdict. He was shifted to Puzhal prison later in the day.
