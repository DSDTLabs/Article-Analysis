PUNE: It’s not just the   and their candidates in the fray at this month’s  .  , a city-based social organization, has decided to field its own candidates, too.

 Lokayat has been working towards civic issues, public transport and upliftment of the underprivileged sector for several years. In its maiden attempt in the political arena, the organization will field its four candidates in the Deccan Gymkhana-Model Colony panel (number 14). 
 
 The organization says this is their attempt to give the common people a voice in local government. The Lokayat candidates will contest under the banner of Socialist Party (India).
 
 For several years, said Lokayat’s Alka Joshi, the organization has been implementing several initiatives aimed at women and youth in areas like Pandavnagar, Wadarwasti and Gokhalenagar. She said they took this decision as it’s high time people were represented in the civic body, and the best way to do that is to be an active part of democracy.
 
 She said that the organization’s members are enthused about this move, and are ready to pull out all stops. As they are aware they don’t have deep pockets like political party, Joshi said they are ready to set an example in cost-effective campaigning. 
 
 “To contest the elections. we will be raising funds from people. But our expenditure will not cross Rs2 lakh. Workers will reach out to voters through door-to-door visits, pamphlets and through the large number of well-wishers who are familiar with Lokayat’s work,” Joshi added.
 
 Lokayukta workers are confident of a good show, as they believe their ‘concrete agenda’ will trump the parties’ attempts to lure voters through inducements like free tours, gifts and cultural programmes. “Political parties and candidates are not thinking beyond tours and shows. They don’t have a concrete agenda or an effective delivery model. Common people’s have remained unaddressed,” Joshi said.
