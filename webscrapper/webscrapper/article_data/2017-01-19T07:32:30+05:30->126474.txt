MADHUBANI: Resentment prevails among L N   teachers following the registrar’s move to change the university Syndicate’s decision on the deduction of teachers’ EL (earned leave) for their 131-day strike in the year 2000.

 According to sources, the issue of the longest ever strike of university and college teachers in the state from August 1, 2000 to December 9, 2000 has been eluding a resolution in LNMU for last 16 years while it was amicably resolved in all other universities of the state.
 
 “The LNMU registrar's memo number 11544-643/16 dated December 27, 2016 has given a new twist to a resolved issue, inviting the possibility of a plethora of court cases questioning the official's authority to do so. The registrar has stayed the operation of the university’s letter number 12803-895/dated August 12, 2015 and ordered calculation of EL of retiring teachers after deducting the 131 days of strike period. The registrar has also ordered recalculation of the permissible EL to all such retired teachers who had been given the benefit of the university letter but have not been paid so far,” said a teacher.
 
  president   said the issue had been resolved after the issuance of the university letter which stopped deduction of 131 days from retiring teacher's EL. The university notification was preceded by a unanimous resolution to the effect of the Syndicate, which was subsequently approved by the Senate. Teachers had agreed to forgo the claim of salary for the strike period as a compromise formula, he said.
 
 Jha assailed the registrar's move and urged the   to restrain LNMU officials from acting in contravention of the Act and Statute, according to which the Syndicate is the highest executive body of a university. He also exhorted the teachers to agitate against the illegal diktats of the officials.
