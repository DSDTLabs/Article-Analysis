Four children with special needs who participated in the   run crossed the finish line without wheelchairs. 

 They were brought by   in Santacruz , which assists low-income special needs children with education, therapy and nutrition. 
 
 The NGO had arranged wheelchairs in case the children, who suffer from a range of illnesses including Cerebral Palsy, Down’s Syndrome and Autism, got tired mid-way. But the children were so excited they refused to sit on the wheelchairs. “Ranjan insisted on walking,” said the NGO spokesperson, “and Sahil wanted to make the volunteers sit on the wheelchair and push them instead.”
