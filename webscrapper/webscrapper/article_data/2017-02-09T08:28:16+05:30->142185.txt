BENGALURU: The   meeting here on Wednesday witnessed an uneasy moment when some legislators demanded disciplinary action against party veterans C K Jaffer Sharief, B   and H Vishwanath for speaking against the party's state leadership. 

  Sources said the discussion started with some MLAs criticizing Vishwanath for allegedly speaking against CM Siddaramaiah recently. "The party has made Vishwanath an  , an MP and a minister too. He has enjoyed prime positions in the party and he still continues to bad-mouth the CM and the high command. He should be shown the door or else the   will face more embarrassment from him," a few MLAs said. 
 
  Another section, meanwhile, sought action against Sharief and Poojary. While Sharief was accused of calling the Siddaramaiah government a 'kuruba government', Poojary had called Siddaramaiah a 'curse' to the Congress after former minister S M Krishna quit the party. Not all the party MLAs, however, were enthused by the demand for action against the three senior Congressmen. "A majority of the MLAs seeking action are supporters of the CM or have joined the Congress in the recent years," a senior Congress minister said.
