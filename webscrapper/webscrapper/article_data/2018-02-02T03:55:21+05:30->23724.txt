KOLKATA: The West Bengal   on Thursday arrested two members of the neo-JMB (Jamaat-Ul-Mujahideen), which was part of a module that tried to carry out a blast at   during the Dalai Lama’s visit on December 19. Around 50kg ammonium nitrate — a cheap but deadly fertilizer used in the production of bombs — was recovered from the duo along with electronic devices, gloves, ancillary chemicals and booklets, police said. Police said both the accused had confessed that they wanted to “avenge the continued genocide and torture of Rohingyas in Burma”.

 Police suspect that little-known Rohingya terror group,   (AMM), has developed ties with the JMB. The duo has been identified as Md Paigamber Sk (24) of Kankuria village in Murshidabad’s Samserganj and Jamiul Sk (31) of   (Ratanpur) also in Samersanj.
