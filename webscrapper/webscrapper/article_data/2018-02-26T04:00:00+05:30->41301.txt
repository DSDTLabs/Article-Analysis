Palanpur: Chairman of Black Business Chamber (BBC) from South Africa (SA) Sizwe Ngame was mighty impressed with the gigantic plant of Banas dairy, the biggest dairy of Asia, which he visited on Sunday. 

 Talking to TOI, Mohammad Aamir Mirza, adviser to Ngame, said, “We will establish a dairy plant on the lines of Banas dairy in South Africa. Besides dairy project, we are interested in diamond trade and other businesses. Today, we have signed an MoU with the director of N&T Engi-Tech Talley Mohammad Tuvar at Chhapi for providing engineering services in Mozambique, Angola, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.”
 
 “During our weeklong visit to India, we have also entered into an agreement with Puran Purshotam Exporters of Mumbai for opening its branch in South Africa. It has branches in Surat, Belgium, Hong Kong and Mumbai. We also have plans to set up diamond cutting and polishing units in South Africa,” Mirza said. 
 
 “We plan to get roughs and polished diamonds at reasonable cost for the units to be set up in South Africa. We are keen to establish an International School of Gems and Jewellery like the one in Surat. A delegation comprising 200 people from South Africa will visit India in April to conduct a comprehensive study on dairy farming, diamonds, parasitical industries, cement unit, petrochemicals, FMCG power plant and other sectors,” he added. 
 
 Mirza was of the view that there should be direct flights from Dubai to Surat so as to facilitate investors to land directly in the Diamond City, without having to change flights.
