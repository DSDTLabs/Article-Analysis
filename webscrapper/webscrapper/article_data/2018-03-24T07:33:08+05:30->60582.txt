 In UP, 14 cities have been selected for the All India Ranking of Livability Indices. These are Allahabad, Aligarh, Kanpur, Lucknow, Jhansi, Varanasi, Agra, Bareilly, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Rae   and  . Notably, all these cities were recommended by the government for   also but only 10 could make it to the final list.
 
 Municipal bodies in these cities are nodal agencies for this survey. They will collect data from various government departments, looking after these facilities and will submit the complete report on these parameters to the Centre by April 16. In Lucknow, the municipal corporation has already sent a note to departments like LDA, Jal Sansthan, Lucknow Metro, UPSRTC, DUDA, BSA, CMO, traffic police and   to provide the information.
