NEW DELHI: The   on Friday held that the office of the   is not a “public authority” as defined under the  , since AG’s “predominant function” is to give advice on legal matters to the government.

 A division bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice   reversed the decision of a single judge and observed that the AG appears in court on behalf of the government of India, having a fiduciary relationship with the government, due to which his opinions cannot be put in the public domain.
 
 The court set aside a March 2015 verdict by a single judge, which had said the office of the top law officer was answerable to public under the transparency law as he performs public functions and is a Constitutional appointee.
 
 “Essentially, the function being that akin to an advocate of the government, he is in a fiduciary relationship with the Centre and cannot put in the public domain his opinions or the materials forwarded to him by the government,” the Chief Justice’s bench noted in its verdict on Friday.
 
 HC added that, “The service of the AG is to advice the government on legal matters and perform other duties such of a legal character as may be assigned. The AG is not a functionary reposed with any administrative or other authority that effect the rights or liabilities of persons.”
