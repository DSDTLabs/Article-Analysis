PATNA: A video showing school and college teachers in   and Supaul districts accepting   from students — to allegedly increase their marks in classes X and XII board practical examinations — went viral on social media on Thursday.

 The video clearly showed the exchange of money between students and teachers, with several students claiming to have ‘paid’ examiners to obtain higher marks in the final board practical exams for classes X and XII, which began on January 23 and January 11, respectively. A student of Samastipur’s Dumri College said ‘masterji’ had taken Rs 200 to give him “full marks” in the social science practical, even as the teacher denied the charges upon being confronted, claiming that the examinations were conducted in a free and fair manner.
 
 Refuting the allegations, state education minister Krishnanandan Prasad Verma said, “The practical examinations were conducted under strict invigilation. I had also visited some examination centres and found no use of unfair means.” Verma, however, said that the accused would be stringently dealt with if the allegations were found to be true.
 
 The video comes as yet another embarrassment to the   (BSEB), which had earlier derived criticism for failing to check illegal methods of scoring greater marks in exams.   chairman Anand Kishor said district magistrates and district education officers of Supaul and Samastipur have been asked to authenticate the veracity of the video. “If found guilty, the accused will face action,” he added.
