MYSURU/KODAGU: A 5-year-old   in Balakovu section of the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve on Wednesday.

 The decomposed carcass was noticed by forest staff on patrol in the area between Nagarahole and Sunkadakatte.

 Initial reports suggested that all the 18 claws, canines and whiskers were intact. The sex of the tiger couldnâ€™t be ascertained as the hind portion was eaten by wild animals.
 
 Forest officials also noticed four canine marks around the neck of the tiger which suggest the death could have taken place due to in-fighting.
