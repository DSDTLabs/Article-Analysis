HYDERABAD: The Bhumika Women’s Collective (BWC) has made many key recommendations for streamlining support system for   in distress, including fast verdicts.

 Pre-marital counselling should be conducted for all students at college levels and gender desks be established in educational institutions, the BWC study says. It also wants separate   (PO) at mandal, divisional and district levels for implementation of Domestic Violence (DV) Act with special powers to take immediate action in complaints. There should be space for counsellors to carry out their regular work and each police station should have such counsellors.
 
 “There should be an environment for women to express their concerns and seek help to get information about the Act or in filing cases. All staff and stakeholders under the Act should be provided with training at regular intervals. The training should focus on building capacities and gender perspective among stakeholders,” C Prashanti of Bhumika said.
 
 Other major recommendations included setting up of special courts and wherever possible woman judges and magistrate be appointed in each district to handle DV cases. The BWC study also suggested that arrangements must be made for fast-track courts to deal exclusively with DV cases. “The government should appoint separate prosecutor in each court for DV cases and also designate separate advocates for each case. The court should ensure speedy disposal of cases with final orders,” Bhumika Women’s Collective study says. 
 
 “We have said cases should be disposed of within the stipulated period as envisaged by the law. Women survivors should get support especially in instances when a husband changes his profession or leaves the job with an intention to escape from paying maintenance,” Prashanti added.
