NAGPUR: Before any new invention can be patented, extensive research must be done to ensure the idea is unique, said patent and trademark attorney   in her key note address at the national seminar on   (IPR) and importance of patents to boost research, on Monday.

 The seminar was organized by LAD College for Women of Arts, Science and Commerce, Shankar Nagar and held at the college premises. 
 
 “The inventor has to be mindful of novelty, inventiveness and industrial use of his creation before it can be patented,” said Sharma.
 
 According to Sharma, the benefits of inventions and authorships are eventually passed on to the public which is why patents and copyrights cannot be renewed after a stipulated period expires. In contrast, trademarks are perpetual because of their commercial value which businesses can capitalize upon, she said.
 
 Businesses which choose to guard trade information must be cautious about information leakage, said Sharma. She also said that some may patent trade secrets which involves providing critical information to the patent office. “The food industry is well-known for keeping secrets,” she said.
 
 Traditional knowledge — a practice or commodity indigenous to a particular region or community — cannot be registered under the IP laws, said Sharma. 
 
 Stating an example, Sharma said an   claimed a patent on turmeric for its medicinal use in the 1990s. The patent was revoked after the  , a unit of  , submitted evidence of the plant being used to treat ailments in India for centuries. India had then taken strong exception to patent of turmeric.
 
 Sharma also said that assessing the commercial value of intellectual property is difficult because it is intangible, but it is not impossible once it is registered. “Any idea is your idea once you register it,” she said.
