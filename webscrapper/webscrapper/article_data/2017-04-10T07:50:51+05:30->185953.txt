PUNE: The   at Gultekdi will soon allow the   only during restricted hours to protect the interest of farmers and ensure they get better returns from the  . 

 More than 500 truckloads of vegetables arrive at the   every day. Farmers sell these vegetables to wholesalers through auctions that begin early in the morning and continue till late afternoon. Rates vary every day depending on the inflow.
 
 The   (APMC) has decided to restrict the auctions of vegetables, potato and onion till 1pm. APMC sources said this was done as the existing mechanism favours wholesalers over farmers. They added that officials held a series of meetings with all stakeholders to finalise these timings. 
 
 They said that the prices quoted by wholesalers in daily auctions are higher during the early morning hours but gradually drop by the afternoon, which hampers farmers' income. Many times, the wholesalers push the auctions till late afternoon to drop the prices. So, farmers have no choice but to sell their produce at lower rates fearing damages and losses.
 
 If the trade between wholesalers and farmers is executed without inflated rates, the move will also help retailers maintain prices on the lower side, officials said.
 
  Evening trade likely soon 
 
 Meanwhile, the Market Yard may soon start vegetable trade during the evening hours besides the morning hours. Sources in the APMC said talks pertaining to introduction of evening trade were under-way with concerned stakeholders, and the committee would soon come up with a detailed plan. 
 
 Farmers across the district have been demanding evening trade as they say it will help they fetch better income. 
 
 Sources in the market said that evening wholesale trade is already under-way in areas like Chandannagar on Ahmednagar Road and Saswad on Pune-Baramati Road.
