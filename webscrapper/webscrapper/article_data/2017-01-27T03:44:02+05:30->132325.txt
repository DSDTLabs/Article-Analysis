NOIDA: A 36-year-old man seeking to contest assembly election from the Noida assembly seat declared Russian President   as a friend and Mahatma Gandhi, along with several other freedom fighters and leaders, as his prastavaks (introducers) in his nomination papers.

 The political journey of the candidate,  , was, however, cut short with the cancellation of his candidature for not providing substantial information. Pawar was one of the 28 candidates in GB Nagar whose nominations were cancelled. 
 
 Pawar said he had never met Putin but hoped one day the Russian president would meet him. “I have firm belief in him. I will also visit Russia soon and meet Putin,” he said. Asked about his prastavaks, he said, “When I have some great people to name as prastavaks, why should I name local residents.” Pawar is a graduate in chemistry and lives in Amrapali Royal in Indirapuram. He runs a coaching centre in Noida’s Sector 50.
 
 In the affidavit submitted to the returning officer, Pawar claimed that the Russian president was one of his best friends. “Some time in the future Vladimir Putin will sign on this form,” he has written on the form leaving a blank space to accommodate a signature. 
 
 Besides Gandhi, he named Swami Vivekananda, Martin Luther King Junior, B R Ambedkar, APJ Abdul Kalam, Nelson Mandela, Subhash Chandra Bose, Gautam Buddha, Abraham Lincoln and others as ‘prastavaks’. Kumar Vineet, GB Nagar’s deputy election officer, said an independent candidate needs signatures of 10 ‘prastavaks’ on the affidavit and they must also be voters in the same constituency.
