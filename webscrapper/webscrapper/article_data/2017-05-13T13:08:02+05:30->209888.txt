NASHIK: Even over two years after an approval to the 30 cluster projects for mechanisation of vineyards, around 27 cluster projects are yet to receive funds from the central government.
 
 

 The   ( ), a state-level association of grape-growers, has urged the government to release funds at the earliest.
 
 
 
 As per the scheme, the cluster of grape growers with a total of 100 acre of vineyards will be set up for mechanization. The machinery and equipments required for the vineyards will be bought under the project. The central government provides 50% financial assistance for the import of the machinery for farming, while the group of farmers has to bear the remaining cost.
 
 
 
 A senior office-bearer of MRDBS said, “As scarcity of labours is one of the major issues the grape-growers are facing in the region, we have decided to resort to mechanization of vineyards. The government has already given approval to 30 cluster projects, including 19 in   district.” He added, “Of 30, the government has released funds of Rs 1 crore each to three cluster projects, which are located in Nashik, Pune and   districts. But, the government is yet to release funds for remaining 27 cluster projects.”
 
 
 
 The machineries, required for vineyards, are imported and so expensive. An individual grape grower can’t afford the cost of importing machineries. The cluster project under the central government helps farmers to use the technology in groups by rotation with minimum financial contribution. The activities from pruning, spraying to harvest are carried out through machines. One cluster is formed with group of farmers with minimum 100 acres vineyards.
