Panaji: After protests at the last   compelled authorities to cancel the three public meetings at Vasco, Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has now decided to reschedule the public meetings in April at Tilak Maidan, Vasco. Refusing to accept the demand to hold public deliberations for the three related projects on a single Sunday, authorities have spread the public hearings over three weekdays from April 26-28.

 “The district magistrate for South Goa has intimated fresh dates for the conduct of the environmental public hearing. The concerned persons, having plausible stake in the environmental aspects of the project or activity, can provide their views and suggestions,” GSPCB said in a notice.
 
 GSPCB will hold the public hearing on April 26 at 10.30am to hear objections and suggestions on the proposal to increase the terminal capacity at berth 5A and 6A by south west port. Citizens will get a chance to voice their thoughts on capital dredging for capesize vessels on April 27 at 10.30am while the public hearing for the redevelopment of berth 8 and 9 by   will be held on April 28.
 
 The hearings were first scheduled for February 17 but after citizens objected to the date and venue the public hearing was fixed for March 20 at Vasco Residency hall. Protests by 500 people at Vasco Residency forced officials to cancel that meeting too.
 
 Locals and non-government bodies have objected to Mormugao Port Trust’s (MPT) expansion projects, saying that the residents were fed up with dust pollution and damage to the ecology.
 
 “Why should fishermen suffer and private companies benefit?” Goenchea Ramponkarancho Ekvott (GRE) joint secretary Olencio Simoes said while protesting against the coal-handling operations at MPT.
 
 Citizens have also urged authorities to hold the public hearings on a single day, preferably on a Sunday or on Saturday evening at Tilak Maidan stadium, to accommodate a large crowd.
