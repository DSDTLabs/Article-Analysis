Most of her visits to Mumbai have been fairly discreet. However, this time,   is in the city with a purpose. Apart from honouring professional commitments, spending time with family and savouring mangoes, the actress is in talks to adapt an Emmy Award winning show for the Indian audience. While she hasn’t frozen on her plans yet, she’s open to making it for the small screen and for the web. 

 Confirming the news to BT, the actress says, “I can’t name the show because I am contractually bound but it’s true that I want to remake it for the Indian audience. We haven’t decided on the platform yet because it all depends on how things move. It’s a strong show centred on a female character who is independent and takes charge of her life. It will be nice to see a character which doesn’t fit into the typical saas and bahu bracket. Another reason to be in Mumbai is that I have my family and my little nephew here. I’m also relishing chat and mangoes in the city. You don’t get these mangoes anywhere else in the world.”
