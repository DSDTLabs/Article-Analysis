PANAJI: The state transport department on Thursday issued a notification extending the deadline for installation of   for taxis till July 18.

 Last week, tourist   operators had gone on a statewide strike opposing the Supreme Court order that mandates the installation of speed governors on taxis among other commercial vehicles. The strike was called off following an assurance that the government will file an intervening petition in the Supreme Court to seek relaxation for taxis in Goa.
 
 The notification stated, ‘The Goa government all the transport vehicles having four wheels whose gross weight does not exceed 3,500kg and which are used for carriage of passengers and their luggages, with seating capacity not exceeding eight passengers in addition to the driver seat from the requirement of fitment of speed governor up to July 18, 2018’.
 
 The notification, signed by director of transport, Nikhil Desai, further elaborated that the exemption will be till the above date or until such a time that ‘speed governors of two to three manufacturers are easily available at reasonable/competitive rates, whichever is earlier.’
 
 The ministry of road transport and highways had issued a notification in 2015 amending the Central Motor Vehicles Rules. According to the amendments to Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Act, 1989, speed governors are required to be fitted in transport vehicles with a maximum preset speed limit of 80km per/hour.
 
 This order was issued by the Supreme Court in order to curtail the speed of heavy vehicles. In Goa, all vehicles that fall under the M1 category i.e., goods vehicles, tempos, buses etc came under its purview. A letter from the Supreme Court committee on road safety on April 11, 2017, mandated that all taxis be included in this category.
