Jabalpur: Bodies of two engineering students were taken out after they were found floating at Saraswati Ghat of Narmada river, in Jabalpur district on Tuesday. It is suspected that both girls were very close to each other and as the marriage of one of them was fixed, they decided to end their lives.

 The two who originally hailed from Maihar in Satna district were pursuing engineering from Shriram Engineering College in Jabalpur town.
 
 Their hands were tied with each other, leading the police to suspect that it is a case of suicide. 
 
 The deceased have been identified as Neha and Kajal Chouhan. They were friends since childhood. Both were students of fifth semester and lived in a rented accommodation near ITI College, said police.
 
 “They had left their rented house together on February 3 but did not return. Later, when their parents tried to contact them on their mobiles, both phones were found to be switched off. Subsequently, they lodged a missing person’s report on February 4,” Madhotaal police station in-charge Amit Dandi told TOI.
 
 He added, “Mother of Kajal informed us that her daughter’s marriage had been fixed recently. Investigations reveal that as both girls were living together since their childhood, it has emerged prima facie that they took the extreme step because they did not want to be separated. However, the probe is still on and things will be clear once it is over.”
 
 The bodies were fished out after they were found to be floating near Bhedaghat, and sent for post-mortem examination, said police.
