SURAT: The   (SMC) in the last one year closed eight outlets that released   into Tapi, yet there is hardly any improvement in the quality of water of the river and it continues to be highly polluted. The reason is 380 million litre per day (MLD) of sewage from 11 villages under the   (SUDA) area and industrial waste continue to be released into the river. 

 
  
 
 Surat BJP will soon be launching a campaign to clean Tapi and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are expected to lend it a helping hand. Thousands of party workers are likely to clean the river of water hyacinth and hydrilla. 
 
 Associate professor at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology Dr S A Christian told TOI, “We have informed SMC authorities about the need to completely stop sewage from flowing into Tapi. Only then can we have good quality of water in the river.” 
 
 SVNIT is working on a project for SMC to check sewage water from flowing into the river and converting hyacinth into fuel.
 
 A SMC officer said, “Sewage is nutrient for hyacinth and hydrilla. Despite our removing them, they keep surfacing in the river waters. This causes less oxygen content in the water and affects its quality. We need to close sewage outlets of upstream villages to improve water quality.”
