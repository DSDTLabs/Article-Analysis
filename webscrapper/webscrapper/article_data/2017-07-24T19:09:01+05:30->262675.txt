CHANDIGARH: A day after TOI reported that ‘Punjab snubbed  's job request 6 years back', the Punjab government on Sunday offered the Moga girl DSP's post.

 "Proud of @ImHarmanpreet, they gave an excellent fight to   in the World Cup final, would be happy to appoint her DSP if she desires," Punjab chief minister Captain   stated through a tweet minutes after the Indian eves lost to England in the World Cup finals at the Lord's.
 
 Amarinder also announced Rs 5 lakh cash award for the star player. The chief minister called up Harmanpreet's father Harmandar Singh Bhullar and promised to ensure the welfare of sportspersons who were contributing to the state's glory.
 
 The chief minister praised Harmanpreet and said the young girl had done the state proud with her superb performance, which helped the Indian women's team reach the final.
 
 Harmanpreet was in superb form in the semifinal and final of the World Cup. She smashed an unbeaten 171 against Australia in the semis and then scored 51 in the final versus England.
 
 He added that his government wanted to correct the wrong perpetrated on the young cricketer by the previous Akali Dal government, which had refused to accommodate her in the force.
 
 In 2010-11, when Harmanpreet was in dire need of a job, the Punjab government snubbed her application for a job in the Punjab Police. She had already played two years for the national team by that time.
 
 A senior official in Punjab Police had told Harmanpreet that ‘she isn't a Harbhajan Singh that a DSP post will be given'. She wasn't even granted the post of inspector.
 
 Harmanpreet's plea was also rejected by the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. She was told that there is no provision for employment in Punjab Police for women cricketers.
