AURANGABAD: Former   and   governor   on Saturday questioned the allocation of funds in the   for fiscal 2018-19 for the proposed health insurance scheme and for raising farmers’ income. 

 Addressing a seminar in   on the problems of farmers and workers, the former Aurangabad MP said the Narendra Modi-led government was now talking about a health insurance scheme which was actually launched by the UPA government in 2008.
 
 “Also, the Budget has not allocated adquate funds for the proposed health insurance. It’s a jumla, or farce,” he said.
 
 He also wondered how the farmers’ income would be doubled without increasing the minimum support price (MSP) for crop procurement. The budgeted allocation for the agriculture sector will be required to be doubled to double the farmers’ income, which has not been done, Nikhil said and reiterated the Modi government was only making false announcements, which could never be fulfilled. 
 
 He also regretted that the Modi government’s employment and foreign policies had also miserably failed.
