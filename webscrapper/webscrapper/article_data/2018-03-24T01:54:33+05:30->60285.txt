GURUGRAM: A resident of Delhi lodged a complaint with Gurugram police on Thursday against an autorickshaw driver and his aide, alleging that the two had snatched his wallet, along with his ATM card, and mobile phone on Wednesday. Later, the two allegedly withdrew Rs 40,000 from his account using the ATM card, the PIN of which was saved in his phone, he claimed. 

 The complainant, Sachin Singh, a resident of Gautam Vihar in Shahdara in Delhi, said he had come to Gurugram on Wednesday afternoon for some work. He took a CNG auto-rickshaw, which already had one passenger, from   to Udyog Vihar. “Around 3pm the auto-rickshaw reached the service lane near Airtel building. Suddenly, the driver stopped the auto and, along with the passenger, thrashed me badly. Then they fled with my bag, phone and wallet. I somehow managed to reach home and when I approached my bank, I found that Rs 40,000 was withdrawn from my account using my ATM that was kept in my wallet. I had saved my ATM PIN in my phone. The two men might have used it for withdrawing the money,” said Singh said in his complaint.
 
 An FIR has been lodged against two unknown persons under sections 379 A (snatching), 34 (common intention) of the IPC at Sector 18 police station. “We’re investigating the matter and trying to identify the auto-rickshaw with the help of CCTV footage of the area,” said ASI Mahender Singh, the investigating officer.
