SURAT: The country’s largest man-made fabric (MMF) wholesale market in Surat is hit hard following the indefinite strike called by truck owners in   to protest mainly the proposed 50% hike in the third party insurance premium. 

 Industry sources said that south India is the big market for saris and dress material with the daily supply to the tune of over Rs 30 crore. Out of the total four crore meters of fabric production in the city, around 25% is meant for the supplies to South India markets including Chennai, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. 
 
 “Lorries are not going to southern states from the city. Trucks which have national permit have been diverted. All south India bound trucks and lorries have stopped. And there is no movement from south India also,” said president of   (FOSTTA), Manoj Agarwal.
 
 Agarwal added, “South India is the big market for the textile traders. We have been sending around Rs 35 crore worth of textile goods to south India states per day. The truckers’ strike has affected the business of the traders here.” 
 
 President of   (STGTA), Yuvraj Deshle said, “We can’t take risk by accepting the delivery of textile goods towards the south India states. The truckers’ strike has entered into its third day and it is going to continue till their demands are not met. We have stopped taking bookings for south India.”
