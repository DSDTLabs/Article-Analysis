INDORE: A train at a speed of 110km/hour on the tracks threw away dust making it look like a thick cloud of dust suspended in the air here.

 It was a scene near   on Monday evening when the railways conducted speed trial of a newly laid broad gauge rail line between Indore and Tihi to check performance of the track. 
 
 This new 23-km line between Indore and Tihi under Indore-Dahod rail line project is expected to be commissioned by the western railways in 15 days. The commissioner of railways safety (CRS) Sushil Chandra conducted trial on this newly converted track at a speed of 110km/hour.
 
 Chandra is expected to give trial report by this week and he would also mention speed limits of the track. After this the railway would issue an authorization and then the train would become operational.
 
 Authorities on Sunday also carried out a technical inspection of this track. 
 
 “The track is almost ready for operations of passenger trains, but a final decision in this regard will be taken up by the railway board,” said Chandra. He further said the track has been developed in best manner, there were few shortcomings which will be rectified soon and then the track would be made open for train operations. 
 
 The CRS began his trial from   around 5.10 pm and concluded at Indore at 5.31pm. The train also had halts at Rau and Rajendra Nagar railway stations.
