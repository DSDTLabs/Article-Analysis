BENGALURU: The   on Miller's Road, which had been left unrepaired for a long time, was fixed within four to five days after TOI published a report on how the corroded tin base and leakage were posing a threat to commuters. 

  The corroded base of the bridge had been leaking and falling in bits and pieces on vehicles passing underneath. Though officials had denied the leak earlier, they rushed to repair it later. The railways cleaned the corroded base and replaced the rusty tin sheets with new ones. 
 
 The railways has taken cognizance of the TOI report on Twitter; action was taken swiftly by South Western Railways (SWR), according to a statement. "Convenience of passengers, as well as commuters related directly or indirectly to railways, is our priority. As soon as the issue came into my notice, it was taken up and resolved by the team," said R S Saxena, railway manager, Bengaluru division, SWR. 
 
 Bridge number 841 B is one of the oldest railway bridges in the city and connects Cantonment railway station to   and   stations. Most trains passing through Cantonment take this route.
 
  "They have covered the base neatly by removing or covering all the corroded parts. They should have done it much earlier and inspected it regularly instead of just taking action based on newspaper reports," said  , a regular commuter on Miller's Road.
