Salem: The Tamil Manila Congress (TMC) leader G K Vasan on Friday said the Karnataka government had been for long betraying Tamil Nadu and its farmers in Cauvery water sharing issue. 

 Addressing the media, Vasan, who had come to Salem to attend a wedding, said, the Tamil Nadu government should not comply with central government, especially in issues that are related to people’s rights. 
 
 Condemning Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah’s recent statement that he would not allow the Cauvery Management Board, Vasan said Karnataka government should approach this issue with humanity. “Tamil Nadu people will not forgive central and Karnataka government for their betrayal in Cauvery river issue,” he said.
 
 He also advised the central government to give an impartial treatment to all farmers in India. He also urged the Tamil Nadu government to boldly take Cauvery water sharing issue to the central government.
 
 Commenting over Tamil Nadu government’s present political situation, Vasan said the present ruling government will fail to convene an all-party meeting to take concrete decisions in connection with Cauvery issue.
 
 Vasan also criticised the central government for its inaction on issues such as Neduvasal and Kadiramangalam hydro-carbon projects. “The central government did not give importance to people’s views and is forcing people to accept its projects,” he said. tnn
