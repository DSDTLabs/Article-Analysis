 
 I am a mother of a 24-year-old girl and 19-year-old boy. I was a hobby class teacher once, but now I am a homemaker. I was a cycling champion in college, but didn't use a cycle over the past 25 years, after I got married. I joined the bicycle club in June last year, and thatâ€™s when I bought myself a bicycle.
 
 
 I started by doing small distances with my friend,  , who also participated in the race, every week. I started by doing 20 km and soon moved on to 50 km. Once I was confident, I went for 100 km rides. I had participated in brevets earlier also. In this particular race, I had aimed for 100 km, but ended up doing   in 13.5 hours. It helped that I am a yoga student, which helped me build my stamina. A month prior to the race, I went to a doctor who prescribed me some calcium supplements, among other things. However, I found my stamina decreasing and went back to my homemade recipes to increase my strength.
 
 
 I was on top of the world, especially because I never thought I could do it. My family was also shocked. My brother, who had once done 17 km, was so tired that he was on bed for a week. He was in complete disbelief. I wanted to bring a medal for the club, because I want to prove that this can be done at my age also.
