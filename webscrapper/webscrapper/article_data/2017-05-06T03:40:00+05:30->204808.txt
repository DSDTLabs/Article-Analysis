NAGPUR: The state   has made it mandatory for all schools (regardless of affiliating board) to install a   on campus and place it at a prominent place. The state’s directive also says ideally police should be present when the box is opened on the last working day of every week, but exceptions can be made if there are manpower issues. 

 The complaint box has to be opened in the presence of school officials along with parents’ and students’ representative. The state’s directives states a police ‘representative’ also has to be present, which leaves ample room for interpretation. A representative can also mean a civilian appointed by the local police specifically for this purpose. It also makes clear that in case there are problems in engaging a police official, the principal can still open the box with the remaining members. 
 
 District   have to start informing schools under their jurisdiction and start compiling data on how many boxes have been installed. District wise report will be collected by every deputy director of education for their respective divisions. The divisional report will then be sent to Pune to both primary and secondary education directors. Though no timeline for this has been given, it is expected that by the start of new academic session every school in the state will have a complaint box installed. 
 
 When the box is opened, all complaints have to be recorded in a log book. The name of complainant, wherever given, has to be kept confidential. The department has also directed officials to ensure no problem is faced by the complainant in future.
