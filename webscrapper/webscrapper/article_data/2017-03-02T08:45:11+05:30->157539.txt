HYDERABAD: Despite the   effect easing significantly, the sale of vehicles in the city has failed pick up as per expectations in the first two months of 2017.

 The sales statistics, particularly of the car segment, for January and February are not very different from November and December 2016. The downward spiral that began in November last year-a direct impact of demonetisation--was due to insufficient money in the market.
 
 Going by the number of vehicles being registered at the   month on month, the high-end categories are worst affected.Post-demonetisation the numbers dropped to 13,698 from 22,500 in October. While the numbers had slightly picked up to 14,122, they dropped again to 13,471in February . “The market sentiment is still low compared to before the demonetisation.Purchase of high-end cars and superbikes is still lower than 5 per cent. Registrations of twowheelers is more,“ said Panduranga Naik, joint transport commissioner, Hyderabad.
 
 “It's more like an induced attitude of caution that people are sticking to, even after the demonetisation effect has eased out.The impact is likely to linger on.Also the usual trend of people exchanging their old cars for new ones around March end April might not help. Usually part of the payment is accepted in cash which will not be possible given the current situation,“ said V Anil Reddy, advisor to consultative committee for Telangana State, Federation of Telangana and   (FTAPCCI).
 
 In a positive, the dip is a breather for the space crunched city roads, which have seen four straight months of lower number of vehicles being added month on month, added authorities.
