CHENNAI:   leader and MP   Ramadoss on Monday said the   government should ensure that students from Class 3 to Class 12 are taught  . 

 In a statement, Anbumani said computers have become essential in all walks of life. Anbumani recalled that in 2011, when Samacheer Kalvi was introduced, his party urged the state government to ensure computer science was taught from Class 6 to Class 10. Although textbooks were printed, many students were not taught the subject, he alleged.
 
 He said the subject had been made compulsory to clear Class 10 exam in Kerala and states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka have importance to computer science. 
 
 In Puducherry, computer science had been introduced as a subject in 132 government schools, he said.
 
 In private schools in the state, the subject is taught from Class 1 and in central schools such as Kendriya Vidyalaya, it is taught from Class 3, he added.
 
 Further, he said, expecting the government to hire them, several computer science graduates, who also earned a Bed degree, are registered in employment exchanges. By the end of 2015, a total of 39,019 had registered as computer teachers but were yet to find employment, he said.
 
 The Dharmapuri MP also urged the state to hire computer science teachers and ensure that 17,000 part-time teachers are made permanent.
