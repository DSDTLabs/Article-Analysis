MUMBAI: Close to 200 additional   will be available in   across   in the state this year, taking the total count of seats to 1,490. The   (MCI) recommended an increase in PG seats in clinical subjects (broad specialty) in all government colleges after an approval from the Centre. Seats in general surgery and general medicine have seen the maximum jump in seats in the country and even in the state. The additional seats will be added to the pool of seats available in the centralised admission process rounds starting from April 1.

 TOI had earlier reported that the state is likely to get 900 more PG seats in two years, after the announcement of additional 5,000 seats was made in the Union budget. This is the increase approved in the first phase, said director Pravin Shingare, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). He added that 50% of the total seats will go for the all-India quota. “The number of seats has been increased by increasing the ratio of professors to students from 1:2 to 2:3. The growth in general medicine and surgery is because there are more teachers available in these subjects,” said Shingare. While colleges in Rajasthan got the most number of seats in this round, Maharashtra, with 191 seats, witnessed the second highest growth.
 
 In a meeting between representatives of private and deemed colleges and the state, the colleges sought a nod to allow them to hike fees based on their expenditure. “Colleges are not happy with the fees fixed by the fee regulation authority and have sought nod to increase it further,” said Shingare. They also sought the state’s approval to allow them to fill the management seats. In postgraduate courses, 50% seats belong to the management and in undergraduate programmes,   are around 15%. “The state will discuss the matter and convey the final decision,” he added.
