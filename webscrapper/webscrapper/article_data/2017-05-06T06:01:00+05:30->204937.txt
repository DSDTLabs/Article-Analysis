NAGPUR: The state government has rejected two decisions taken by the   (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust ( ) regarding revision of reservations of two lands. It has raised a question mark on decision-making process at both the civic bodies as government found the decisions improper.

 NMC’s proposal was about change in reservation of a Dhantoli-based plot from residential to commercial. The proposal was submitted to the state’s urban development department after resolution passed in the general body. NIT had also proposed to change reservation of a plot in   from residential to industrial. The proposal was submitted to state’s urban development department after a resolution by NIT board of trustees.
 
 In NMC’s case, the urban development department pointed out that the NMC did not take consent of district administration before deciding on the plot. The plot no-30 measuring 9,953 sq.ft is a nazul plot (327) and falls under district administration’s jurisdiction. NMC should not have decided anything about it without consent of the district administration.
 
 In NIT’s case, the decision was rejected because the land in question is surrounded by residential zone. “Land is also in the form of a narrow strip so it is not desirable to include it in industrial zone from planning point of view,” the department said.
 
 The land bearing khasra nos-- 61, 63 and 69 comprises 29 plots from no 616 to 644.
 
 RTI activist TH Naidu said government had taken a right decision in rejecting the two proposals. “City’s development plan (DP) was prepared in 2001 for systematic development. Unfortunately, NMC and NIT are continuously changing the reservations following demands from builders, developers and industrialists. Changes in reservations will result in increase in congestion and inconvenience to the citizens,” he said.
