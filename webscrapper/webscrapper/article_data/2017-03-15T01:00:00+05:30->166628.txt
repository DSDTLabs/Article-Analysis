Unlike his contemporaries,   is exploring other avenues without abandoning the small screen. The actor has signed two diverse films, in which he will be playing radically different characters. While he plays an NRI Punjabi munda in Anees Bazmee’s ' ' starring Arjun and  , he will be seen as a pianist (opposite  ) in Vikram Bhatt’s psychological thriller. Since the characters were strikingly different from each other, they required him to undergo physical transformation too.
“While Mubarakan is a romcom, Vikram’s film is a psychological thriller set in 1930s. From a well-built true-blue Punjabi munda with a sharp hairstyle and beard, I transformed into a lean pianist and shed at least 10 kilos to look the part for the thriller. I’m excited about both the projects,” says Karan. 
 He adds, “I have grown up watching Anil (Kapoor) sir’s films and it’s an honour to shoot with him; I learn so much every day. The feeling when he shakes hands with me on the set is unexplainable. It’s like a big Punjabi family coming together on a set. We crack jokes, talk in Punjabi and Anil sir shares anecdotes with us.”
 While Karan is relishing the new medium, he has no intention of taking a break from television. He elaborates, “I am what I am because of TV. Along with a wide reach, the small screen brings popularity and financial stability. Television actors are recognised all over the world. It’s overwhelming when people tell me about the names of my characters in shows that have been dubbed in their languages. It’s my success on TV that has translated into film offers. The lines have blurred and I want to work on both mediums. TV builds characters. Now, I want to become a brand.”
