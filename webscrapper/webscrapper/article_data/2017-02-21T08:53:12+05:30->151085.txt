THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The decision to release 1,850 convicts prematurely will turn out to be an encouragement for criminals, said   president VM Sudheeran. He said that the government should retract its decision to release those criminals ­ lodged in prisons across the state ­ who were involved in heinous crimes like rape, sexual offences and drug cases.

 Today when such kinds of criminal activities are on the rise, the government's decision to release convicts is a challenge to the society as well as our legal system, Sudheeran said.
 
 “It is strange that when there is a huge demand for strengthening the existing laws to prevent atrocities against women and drug-related offences, the government is planning to release those who have been convicted for such offences," he said, adding that the government move will also give the wrong message that even if such crimes are committed and the culprits are jailed, the government will come to their rescue.
 
 The government's decision to release 1,850 convicts ­ including those convicted under rape, drug-related cases and other such heinous crimes ­ did not fructify as the governor returned the file to the government for reconsideration. The move invited severe criticism from various corners of the society, especially in the backdrop of the   of an actor inside a moving vehicle in Kochi this week.
