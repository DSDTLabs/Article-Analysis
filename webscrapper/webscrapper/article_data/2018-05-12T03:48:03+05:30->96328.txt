NAVI MUMBAI: Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) CEO Vikram Kumar had talks with a   firm in London for two hovercraft services with a cumulative passenger capacity of 100 to connect Ferry Wharf to the satellite townships of Vashi, Belapur and Thane.

 MMB had floated a global tender for selecting an operator for the service on April 20. It had first set the closing date for bidders for May 18, but after pre-bid enquiries, extended it to May 22.
 
 Two bidders evinced interest, chief ports officer Sanjay Sharma said. Any Indian company after procuring a vessel can bid without any foreign tie-up, but if there are more companies and a foreign player, the operator will have to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV), said Sharma. MMB will not be party to any company formation. MMB will have 10% share of the ticket price and the bidder that provides maximum revenue will have an edge in winning the bid. MMB has kept the revenue share a flat amount. 
 
 The tender is for operation and maintenance of hovercraft for five years, extendable by five years.
 
 Kumar has initiated talks with   (MbPT) for approval of landing rights at Ferry Wharf. 
 
 Before talks with a hovercraft firm in London, he engaged NMMC as a partner for waterways transport from Navi Mumbai, but as the civic body did not venture ahead, MMB floated the tender and extended the transportation to Thane.
 
 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is also MMB chairman, had emphasised the importance of promoting waterways transportation to decongest roads.
