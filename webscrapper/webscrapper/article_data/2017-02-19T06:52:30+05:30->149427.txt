THRISSUR: In a welcome development, studies conducted by the   (KAU) under the 'Safe to eat' project revealed that there is a dip in the extent of pesticide contamination in vegetables, fruits and food items during the last four years. 

 As per the studies, hazardous pesticides were detected in 18% of the 1251 samples tested in 2013 when the project was started at the KAU's pesticide residue research and analytical aaboratory (PRRAL) at Vellayani, with financial support from  .
 
 Prof Thomas Biju Mathew, associate director of KAU's plant protection division and head of the PRRAL said, "There appears to be a   in the extent of pesticide over the years. For instance 10% of the 2404 samples tested in 2014 were found to contain pesticides while in 2015 pesticides were detected only in nine per cent of the 2220 samples tested. In 2016 only eight per cent on 1362 samples tested were found to contain pesticides".
 
 According to him the frequent tests and continuous sensitization programmes by various organisations seem to have contributed to the reduction in the presence of   in the vegetables, fruits and other food items being used in the state.
 
 When tests were carried out on 108 samples of 40 varieties of fruits collected from public market and organic shops this year hazardous chemicals were detected above the levels fixed by   (FSSAI) only in samples of Shimla Apple, Avocado, black grapes and mango. The samples were collected from various districts like Thiruvananthapuam, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kasaragod.
 
 He added that detailed studies were required on chemical residues in spices, as the levels are found to be relatively high among them.
