THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Three months after the   imposed a complete ban on use of  irrespective of micron size, the district administration has embarked on a similar mission to make the district free of plastic carry bags.

 In a review meeting held prior to district planning committee meeting here on Saturday, district collector S Venkatesapathy said the plastic-free district project would be implemented soon.
 
 He said alternatives for plastic products would be introduced and Kudumbashree would be entrusted with production of cloth bags. The collector has directed Kudumbashree and   to conduct a study and submit report on May 24.
 
 The latest move of district administration is a marked deviation from its earlier stance. During the review meeting called by the corporation ahead of imposing the ban, it was urged that steps should be taken by the district collector to check the inflow of plastic carry bags from other states. However, the collector had then pointed out practical difficulties.
 
 Earlier, Attingal municipality has also followed suit banning plastic carry bags. Manickal panchayat has recently set up a recycling unit along with Santhigiri ashram. The city corporation is planning to introduce 30 lakh paper and cloth bags by the middle of this year as an alternative to plastic carry bags.
 
 A permanent industrial unit set up by the corporation with the help of a society to ensure consistent supply of cloth bags. However, the corporation is yet to finalise a business model to implement the plan. The health committee had mooted that a training centre at Kumarapuram, which has been closed down for years, could be converted as large scale manufacturing unit by employing Kudumbashree units.
