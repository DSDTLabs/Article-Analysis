GURUGRAM: Stepping up the fight against rising number of female feticides across the district, health officials joined hands with the Gurgaon police and   to set up a permanent joint action committee. The panel, which has been set up acting on the order of the district administration, will rope in informers and conduct enforcement drives under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act.

 On Tuesday, in a meeting chaired by Gurgaon deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh, civil surgeon Dr Pushpa Bishnoi, deputy civil surgeon Saryu Sharma, district drug control officer   and   secretary Shyam   were appointed the permanent committee’s members.
 
 “We used to face trouble in constituting a team whenever we got tip-off on female feticides. Now, we have a core team to carry out raids and keep a track on messages from informers,” a senior medical officer who is part of the team told TOI.
 
 An undercover team will also be set up to gather information and conduct raids. Four police officers from the crime unit-II will be deputed to work for the panel and act upon the instructions of assistant commissioner of police (crime) Mahender Verma.
 
 “The panel will also keep a check on diagnostic centres across the district, and send decoy patients to trap violators. The panel will rope in Asha workers, Anganwadi workers, two students each from every college and village apart from autorikshaw drivers as informers,” said Shyam Sunder, secretary, Red Cross, Gurgaon.
 
 The panel will engage one lakh youths in the drive. Sunder urged the youngsters to take up the responsibility of ringing about the social change.
