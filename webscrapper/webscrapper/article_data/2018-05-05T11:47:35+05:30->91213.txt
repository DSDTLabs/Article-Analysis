CHANDIGARH: The   police have withdrawn the facility of cops travelling free of cost in   buses with immediate effect from Friday. The notice has been issued by the superintendent of police Eish Singhal stating the discontinuation of the free travelling facility in CTU buses by the police personnel.

 The notice reads that the free travelling facility of the police personnel in CTU buses stands withdrawn with immediate effect as not many personnel are using the facility. The notice further advises that if some police officials desire to travel by CTU buses, then he/she might get a monthly pass. However, he has to shell out Rs 200 per month to avail the facility.
 
 In the meantime, some police officials have objected to the withdrawal of the facility. One of the women cops on condition of anonymity, said, “This decision must be withdrawn. There are still many police officials like me who avail the facility and prefer travelling by   buses. Free travelling was a very good facility and withdrawal of the facility will put a financial burden on us,” she said.
