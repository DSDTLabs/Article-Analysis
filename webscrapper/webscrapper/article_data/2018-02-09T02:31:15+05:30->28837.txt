NEW DELHI: Recalling the brutal assault on Nirbhaya in 2012 and Ankit Saxena last week, chief minister   on Thursday made an emotional pitch to   through a radio message appealing for empathy and questioning apathy.

 Kejriwal asked people to help those in distress on the streets or elsewhere instead of looking the other way. The appeal for public conscience was soon turned into a quick video with the text of his message scrolling along with his voice.
 
 “A few days ago, Ankit Saxena was murdered in broad daylight on the road. There were many people there, but no one tried to save him. Some years ago, Nirbhaya was gang-raped and dumped on the road. People saw her lying there but didn’t help. What has happened to us?” the   asked.
 
 He added, “Nirbhaya was our daughter and Ankit was our brother. If we will not save our children who will? What if it was our own child in place of Nirbhaya and Ankit?”
 
 The CM concluded the radio message by trying to shake the conscience of people and asserted, “Next time, don’t leave any Ankit or Nirbhaya alone. Please. Step forward and help. Only then will our society stay safe and Delhi will be safe.”
 
 Earlier this week, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that “murders in the name of honour killings are very disturbing.” He made the point in a note directing the department of art and culture to draw a plan to hold cultural and musical events and organise thought-provoking street plays to draw people to develop an understanding of the deeper meaning of love.
 
 “I think we in the art and culture department should respond to honour killings in our own way. Sahitya Kala Parishad and our academies should come up with thought-provoking programmes like evenings of songs and ghazals of love paying a tribute to all the youngsters killed in this manner,” Sisodia stated.
 
 “The events should be anchored in such a way that the message is loud and clear that it is a sin to kill people who are in love,” the deputy CM added.
