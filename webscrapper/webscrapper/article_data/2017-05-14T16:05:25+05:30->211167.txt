 actor   is ecstatic as his twin daughters along with his wife   finally landed in India a few days ago.
 
  The two revealed the pet names of their twins as Miko and Nonu but now we know their real names as well.
  
  Teejay posted their first family picture together on the occasion of Mother's Day.
  
  
 
  
  The couple have named them -   and  . Isn't it adorable?
  
  
  
  
  Teejay captioned the pic saying "And here is my little #squad - KV, Vienna, Raya Bella and me. :) @karanvirbohra Thank you for arranging yesterday's photo shoot - what a thoughtful Mother's Day gift - our first family photo. :) I still can't believe fast our little world changed! We were happily living our lives and then one fine day, God throws us TWO curve balls! Haha! In one day, we went from being a couple to being a family. :) Now these sweet little girls have found their place in our lives, and have brought so much joy, love and light with them. Today, I am thankful I got to be their Mom. As much as I call them 'my' children, I know that they are only on loan to me for this lifetime. Their souls belong to God, and I am responsible for giving them the happiest life I can, for being the best mother I can. :) #HappyMothersDay to all moms and mom-to-be. We are all so lucky. :)"
  
  Even Karanvir posted a picture from their latest photoshoot.
  
  
  
  
  The twins were born in Canada, where Teejay's family stays. Post the delivery, Karanvir has often flown to Vancouver, Canada to catch up with his wife and kids, but this affair has now ended as the family seems to have flown down to India for good.
  
  The actor has been married to TV actress Teejay for more than 10 years now and the couple has now completed their family with the two beautiful daughters coming into their lives.
