Rajkot: History-sheeter Imran Mugal alias Imran Chipo was arrested on Tuesday for attempt to murder, issuing threats and trying to extort Rs 3 crore from a Dubai-based non-resident Gujarati (NRG) from Veraval town of Gir-Somnath district.

 The arrested accused along with his two accomplices — Hitendra alias Vicky and Amit Goswami — had last week threatened Farooq Hasam Makalai, a native of Veraval town, now settled in Dubai. Makalai had arrived in Veraval for a month on April 22. They were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 341 (wrongful restrain of any person), 387 (extortion) and issuing threat to kill.
 
 However, on Tuesday, Imran, Hitendra and Amit were also charged with attempt to murder and under the Arms Act.
 
 The accused had on Monday allegedly opened fire at the house of Makalai’s nephew Mohammed Faisal Abbas Makalai, 38, a resident of Baharkot area in Veraval town. The firing incident occurred at around 5am at Mohammed Faisal’s residence. The assailants escaped from the spot after the firing.
 
 Based on their mobile phone records police traced Imran to Gangetha village near Veraval town and nabbed him. They also recovered a country-made revolver from him. Police have seized the motorcycle and car used by Imran and others in the crime.
 
 According to police, Imran was a history-sheeter and accused in many cases including extortion, rioting, assault, land grabbing to name a few.
 
 Earlier, on May 6, Makalai went to Veraval town from his village, along with his friend Sattar Mohammed Patel. When riding a motorbike, Imran and his two accomplices intercepted Makalai and put a pistol to his head and demanded Rs 3 crore and threatened to kill him if he did not pay.
 
 In the night, Imran and his men once again intercepted his car near ID Chauhan School and demanded Rs 3 crore. 
 
 After receiving two threats in a day, Makalai approached police and lodged a complaint against Imran and two others.
