AHMEDABAD: Even as the state claimed that every individual in   had access to 135 litres of   a day, the CAG found that in reality it was just 101 litres. 

 In its report for 2015-2016 tabled in the   on Friday, the CAG noted that that despite tall claims, none of the eight municipal corporation could supply water for 24 hours. Supply ranged from 33 minutes a day in Rajkot to four hours in Surat. 
 
 In the case of municipalities, 64 of the 159 bodies had 18% to 77% water connections. There was a glaring disparity in the supply of treated water in municipalities. For instances, Manavadar nagarpalika provided water for just 12 minutes a day, while Sojitra nagarplaika supplied water for nine hours, which was longer than in   of the state.
 
 In the case of water supply coverage, CAG found that Bhavnagar Municipal Corporationâ€™s claims that it had a 100% water supply network were false. In reality, only 79% properties had connections in the city. 
 
 When it came to safety of drinking water, it is mandatory for urban local bodies to take a daily water sample for quality testing. Municipalities like Anjar, Dholka, Gandhidham, Surendranagar and Wadhwan had not taken a single water sample for quality tests.
