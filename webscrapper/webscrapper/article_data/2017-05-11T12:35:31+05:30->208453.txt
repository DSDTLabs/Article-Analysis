SRINAGAR: Lieutenant  , 22, was the son of a small-time apple grower, and worked his way up with sheer grit in the face of odds that presented themselves in abundance in the Valley. He was commissioned in 2 Rajputana Rifles in December 2016.

 Ummer, who excelled at volleyball and hockey at NDA, leaves behind his father, mother and two sisters. His mother, Salima, and father, Fayaz Ahmad Parray, are in shock. His cousin, Manzoor Ahmad Parray, said   was beaten up before being whisked away from in front of family members.
 
 While nearly a thousand people from Sudsuna village in   joined the slain lieutenant’s funeral, sources said unidentified youth pelted stones even during the funeral procession. Intelligence reports said Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists were believed to be involved in the act.
 
 Many expressed rage at the killing. Several young boys were anguished over the attack on the unarmed soldier.
 
 Manzoor added, “He’d come to attend a family function and not to fight militants. Brave Ummer was there for cousin Shafiqa Akhtar’s wedding, in spite of the fact that the area is highly militant-infested.” Born on June 8, 1994, Ummer had been in the   for five months when he was selected for the “Young Officers Course”, beginning September, for elevation to platoon and company commander, Army sources said.
 
 The six-month course is held at Infantry School, Mhow, and Commando School, Belgaum. He was schooled at his native village and cleared his higher secondary exams from Kulgam College, father Fayaz said.
 
 “Young and full of life, the troops enjoyed being with him,” an Army friend said. “Ummer knew the risks, but didn’t think twice about going to his village unarmed,” afamily member said.
