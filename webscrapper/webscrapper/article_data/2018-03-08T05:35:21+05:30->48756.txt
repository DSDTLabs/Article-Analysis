Senior   leader H   on Wednesday regretted his social media post on Tuesday which denigrated social reformer  . In a new Facebook post on Wednesday, Raja blamed his associates for uploading the post without his knowledge.

 “Views can be debated only by countering it and not through violence. I don’t want to hurt anyone. Therefore, if anyone has been hurt due to the post, my heartfelt regret for my action. Also, damaging statues of Periyar is not acceptable. Only through constructive methods can we take the views of Hindus forward along with nationalism in   and spiritualism. It is time to follow the teachings of Muthu Ramalinga Thevar,” Raja said in the Facebook post.
 
 Sources told   that Raja removed his post after the BJP high command pulled him up.
 
 In his new post, Raja blamed the ‘admin’ for uploading the post about razing of a   statue in Tripura and seeking to remove Periyar statues in Tamil Nadu. “The admin had uploaded the post without my knowledge and therefore it has been removed,” said Raja.
 
 Raja told reporters in New Delhi that the post was uploaded when he was on a flight from Chennai. “I was flying from Chennai to New Delhi to attend a party meeting when the post against Periyar was uploaded by my admin. I came to know about it only when I landed in Delhi. I immediately asked the admin to remove the post and it was removed. The admin has also been sacked,” said Raja.
 
 But by the time Raja had got the new post uploaded, the damage had been done and even his party leaders criticised him. “BJP does not subscribe to any kind of provoking or disrespectful statements and actions of vandalism towards leaders like Periyar. We condemn those people who are indulging in such actions,” BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao tweeted.
