Celebs from the Malayalam film industry made a beeline to Anu Mohanâ€™s wedding recently, as the actor, son of Sobha Mohan tied the knot with Maheshwari at a venue in Kayamkulam. His brother Vinu Mohan and wife Vidya turned up in colour coordinated attire, in red silk. Actress Shalin Zoya gave the traditional Kanjeevaram a miss and was seen in a plain red sari, while purple seemed to be the favourite colour for the menfolk. We spotted Indrans, Roopesh Peethambaran and Rony in purple. A classical music band with a bit of contemporary music thrown in played in the background as guests poured in to bless the couple.
