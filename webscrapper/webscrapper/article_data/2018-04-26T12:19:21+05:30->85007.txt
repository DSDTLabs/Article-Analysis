LUCKNOW: Denied their semester results, BEd students of   are hoping that a decision by the high court comes to their rescue like last time. 

 The hearing of the case on whether the college's   are valid or not will be held on Thursday.
 
 In December,   had cancelled IT College BEd examinations finding anomalies in admissions. Later, the university had to allow students to appear for examination after the college moved the high court, challenging the university's decision. In the interest of students, the court had asked LU to allow them to take the examinations. However, the validity of BEd admissions is still disputed.
 
 Students say that neither the college nor the university is considering the future of the 120 BEd students. The two sides should have found a solution sooner instead of dragging the issue.
 
 "For semester I students, it would be a loss of six months but for final-year students, two years will be wasted if the decision is not in our favour," said a BEd final-year student.
 
 "The image of the BEd course in the college has been tarnished. Even if we win the battle of getting a degree, will it help us in getting a job? Private institutions hiring BEd graduates will be apprehensive of the validity of our degree," said another student.
 
 Candidates vying for admission this year are also left in the lurch. 
 
 College principal   said, "I hope the decision will be in the student' interest. Following the HC directives, the college has not begun the admission process to BEd courses for the new session. The admission process has been delayed."
