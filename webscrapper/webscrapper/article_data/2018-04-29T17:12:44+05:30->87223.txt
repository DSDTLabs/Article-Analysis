 The vice president said all higher educational institutes, including central universities, have the onerous responsibility of transforming the country into the epicentre of knowledge and innovation.

 He said though there are more than 800 universities in India, none of them figure in the top-ranking educational institutes in the world.
 
 "We cannot adopt a 'business as usual' approach if we want to change the situation", the vice president said, adding, "From private educational institutions to central universities and academic organisations, all must work in a mission mode to revamp the educational architecture in tune with the requirements of the 21st century to make India a leading nation education and innovation."
 
 Naidu said though India has the third largest higher education system in the world, its Gross Enrolment Ratio was only 25.2 per cent.
 
 Considering the huge demographic dividend the country was blessed with, it was imperative that the higher education system be expanded qualitatively and quantitatively for the betterment of the nation and society, he said.
