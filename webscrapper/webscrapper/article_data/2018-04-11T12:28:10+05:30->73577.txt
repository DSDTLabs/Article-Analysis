MARGAO: Barely a few days after the   (CCMC) sealed the old municipal building, several traders who were evicted from the premises are now cocking a snook at the municipality. Not only have they begun plying their trade from the same shops, they have even managed to restore the electricity connection which the CCMC had claimed to have disconnected. 

 Sources pointed out that a few of the traders have returned to their old shops in the building and are seen carrying on with their trade. 
 
 “This is injustice on other traders who have shifted their business to alternative locations. Sadly, the CCMC is preferring to look the other way. The municipality should seal the shops immediately,” an affected shop owner pointed out.
 
 CCMC chief officer  , when contacted, went on the defensive. “Some of them may have opened the shops to shift their goods elsewhere,”   said, but failed to explain how the power connection was restored.
