LUCKNOW:It has been just10 days since   stopped supply to   reservoir but more than 5 lakh people in Indiranagar and Gomtinagar have begun facing the impact of water shortage.

 Though Kathauta can store supply for about 30 days, it is a recurring problem every year due to poor planning and lack of coordination between the irrigation department and  . The department shuts down Sharda Canal’s supply to Kathauta twice every year—from mid-April to mid-May and from mid-September to mid-October—for cleaning the canal’s bed.
 
 Supply is generally closedfor about30days.This year, the canal is shut from April15 to May 20, posing the threat of a major water crisis. Residents are already complaining about reduction in supply hours in both morning and evening.
 
 Anuja Tewari of sector D in Indiranagar said, “For a few days, we have been receiving supply only during morning hours. Before that, Jal Sansthan was deducting one hour’s supply in both shifts. Those who are dependent on evening supply are facing major crisis. We have tostorewater in largecontainers.”
 
  of sector 18 in Indiranagar said that this happens every year in April and May.
 
 “When Jal Sansthan knows that supply would be closed, why don’t they arrange for an alternative. It is their lack of planning and laxity which causes trouble to us,” he said.
 
 Jal Sansthan general manager   said, “We will deploy submersible pumps to avoid crisis. There are around 68 pumps in Indiranagar. Of this, three were defunct and have been recently repaired. Moreover, we are deducting supply by 20% in both areas to maintain supply till the end.”
