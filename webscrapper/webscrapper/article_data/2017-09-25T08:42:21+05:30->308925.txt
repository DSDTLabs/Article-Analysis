 After the meeting, one of the parti cipants, Mufti  , said that women research scholars shared their perspective on the issue. “The SC passed the judgment on triple talaq owing to pressure from a few women who had moved the court for their personal gains. Instant triple talaq is already prohibited in Islam,“ said Hassanuddin.
