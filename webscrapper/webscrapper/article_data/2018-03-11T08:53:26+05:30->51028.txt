CHARMINAR: An old mosque (Masjid-e-Turabshah) at   in   has turned into a garbage dump, with locals disposing waste on the corners of the structure. Piles of garbage around the graveyard and the mosque have been causing immense problem for visitors.

 Though the mosque authorities had asked   ( ) to clear the garbage and ensure that the surroundings remained clean, they say no action has yet been taken. 
 
 “I have been looking after the mosque for the last 60 years. Since then devotees have been requesting to shift the garbage-dump to another location. But nothing has been done yet. The graveyard has completely turned into a dump-yard. It has even become difficult for people to identify the graves of their loved ones,” said  , one of the mosque’s caretakers.
 
 Locals have even complained of health hazards due to smoke billowing out of the garbage that is burnt sometimes. “We have intimated the concerned authorities several times and sought a permanent solution to the problem here. But the authorities have turned a blind eye towards this issue. The burning garbage and smoke emanating can cause respiratory ailments. GHMC officials should take note of this and shift the dump-yard to some other place,” said Sandeep, a local resident.
 
 Though garbage has been cleared now, locals want GHMC to ensure the surroundings remain clean.
