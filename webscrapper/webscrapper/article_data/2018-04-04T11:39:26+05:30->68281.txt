JAIPUR: The work of health department’s projects of construction of primary health centres, community health centres and other buildings are running at snail’s pace due to ban on sand mining. 

 A lot many projects which were to be completed by March end have failed to meet the deadline. “Since October 2017, we are facing the problem in continuing the construction work as we do not have supply of sand ( ) which is necessary for construction of buildings,” said an official on deputation at health department for constructing the buildings. 
 
 He said that since they were not getting bajri, they started using sand from agriculture fields, but that has also been banned now. The construction of two mother milk banks has also been delayed. 
 
 Officials said that bajri is necessarily required for construction. It’s certain that the construction of projects will be put on hold, if it is not available. The officials said that they have to construct PHC, CHC and sub centres buildings across the state. But, they have failed to get the bajri for construction that is delaying the projects. 
 
 Now, more projects are coming up in the health department for construction as the officials are in Delhi to finalising more projects coming up under National Health Mission. 
 
 Besides, the health department had announced construction of CHCs in Begun of Chittorgarh, Hamirka of Alwar and   of Sikar. Four PHCs will come up at   district, Bhagana of Alwar district,   of   district, Devan of Jaipur district. Six dub health centres will also come up. For each CHC, more than Rs5crore, for construction of each PHC more than Rs1croe and Rs30 lakh for construction of sub health centres have been allocated. 
 
 It’s not only the government building construction comes to a halt but private players are also finding it difficult to construct their buildings.
