Nagpur: ‘Chhavi’, a three-day art   organized by MFA students of  , opened at Chhoti gallery on Wednesday. Showcasing forty works, including water colours, acrylic paintings and sculptures, the exhibition is in the series of academic events organized by the art school.

 All the three artists, Ajay Dhandre, Prateek Bhanuse and Ranjit Deshmukh are established in their sphere and have a huge collection of works. Speaking about his art, Dhandre, whose works have been auctioned internationally and sell in the country too, says, “Here I am showing the work done over the last two years.” 
 
 Dhandre says his art is based on future language and technology and is a coming together of human minds and materialism. Most of the work is in water colours and shows biological organism painted in flat colours like pink, grey and green. “I see the future in digital and my work represents that,” he adds.
 
 Five paintings of Pratik Bhanuse deal with nostalgia. All carry the image of a door. “It denotes positive entrance into life and I have used it in a combination of light and dull colours like yellow, blue and grey,” said Bhanuse, who otherwise also does wall paintings. “This is the new trend now of drawing on a wall which has been prepared with the right texture. It is more realistic,” he says.
 
 Nine sculptures on show have all been executed by Ranjit Deshmukh who has also done work in stone and mix media in Anand Sagar area at Shegaon. Using fibre, stone and wood, he has expressed himself through the works which are inspired by inner feelings. The still pose of Lord Ram shows astuteness and commitment. 
 
 The image of a man coming out of a mirror and placing a hand on his shoulders speaks of the friendship between a person and his mirror image while the art piece titled ‘Vrindavan’, which has a single structure that is half Radha and half Krishna, tells the story of their unison. “These works are my language and I convey my thoughts through them,” Deshmukh says.
