PUNE: The officials at the airport at   here set a deadline for several projects on Sunday. 

 One of the pieces of news shared was that the international cargo hub at the airport will get a trans-shipment facility, using which goods can be sent to different parts of the world with ease. 
 
  director Ajay Kumar said the facility will allow international cargo to the transported on domestic flights first and then loaded on to flights going to different international destinations. 
 
 “The facility will start at Pune’s international cargo facility on March 31. We expect permission from customs authorities very soon. With this system in place, those willing to export cargo anywhere in the world can do so,” Kumar said. 
 
 The airport has had four international flight operations for a while. They include two to Dubai (  and  ), one to Abu Dhabi ( ) and one to   ( ).
 
 “Presently, only SpiceJet is exporting cargo to Dubai from the facility. However, Air India and Jet Airways have received permissions from customs, and they too should start the facility any time now. As far as the international cargo import facility is concerned, we need additional land and the project will be taken up as soon as that happens. Once we get the land, it will take us three months to start the import facility,” the director added.
 
 With the airport witnessing a sharp rise in the number of passengers, Kumar said they expect passenger traffic in 2017=18 to touch 82 lakh. “It (the passenger traffic) has been on a constant rise, and we hope to keep it up. Right now, the airport is in possession of 15.84 acres of land, which we got from defence authorities, and we are working on projects such as the new terminal building and parking bays. An additional 15 acres of land will be coming to us. Once that plot is under AAIs possession, it will be used for more development projects,” Kumar further added.
