BATHINDA: A shocking difference between the statistics of the Union agriculture and farmer welfare ministry and those of the surveys conducted by universities in Punjab on number of farmers’ suicides in the state came to light on Tuesday when the Union ministry tabled the provisional data of   for the years 2013 to 2016 in the Lok Sabha in response to a question raised by 12 MPs.

 The ministry recorded less than one fourth of the suicides against those counted by the universities of Punjab in its field surveys.
 
 As per the data shared in the Parliament, 271 farmers and farm labourers committed suicide in Punjab in 2016 whereas across the nation a total 11,370 farm and farm labourers ended lives during this period. The data released for four years from year 2013 to 2016 shows 48,104 farmers and farm labourers committed suicide in the country whereas in Punjab 542 farmers and farm labourers ended lives during this time. The data has been sourced from the   (NCRB).
 
 However, the door-to-door survey conducted by the three universities of Punjab has recorded 16,600 suicides in last 16 years, resulting in an average of over 1,000 suicides a year. Punjab-based farm organizations have slammed the Union government data and have claimed that due to highly decreased numbers, the state fails to get proper share of welfare schemes as was in 2009 when Punjab farmers got relief of debt waiver of only 1,050 crore out of total Rs 71,000 crore announced by the UPA government.
 
 The data released by MoS Parshottan Rupela, 83 farmers and farm labourers committed suicide in 2013, only 64, including 40 farm labourers and 24 farmers committed suicide in 2014, 124 including, 24 labourers and 100 cultivators ended lives in 2015, and 271 which include 49 farm labourers, and 222 farmers ended lives in Punjab in 2016.
 
 The figures for entire country respectively are 11,772, 12,360, 12,602 and 11,370 for the given four years. The question about farm suicides was asked by 12 MPs, including   president and Gurdaspur MP  .
 
 “Only few families follow the police case after suicide is committed which is recorded by the NCRB. That is why figures of farm suicides in Punjab are very low as per the Union agriculture ministry records. The three universities conducted door-to-door survey in 2017 and according to this survey, 16,606 farmers and farm labourers committed suicide from year 2000 to 2015, which turns out to be an average of over 1,000 suicides every year.
 
 “The report of the survey has been provided to the state government. There is a dire need for other states to conduct such surveys too”, said Prof Sukhpal Singh, HoD economics and sociology department,   (PAU). Sukhpal was nodal officer for the farm suicide survey conducted by the three universities.
 
 Prof   of the Centre for Research in Economic Change at Punjabi University, Patiala, said, “Many more farmers and farm labourers have committed suicide in Punjab as we recorded in the field survey. The NCRB data is not the true reflection to know the quantum of suicides”.
 
 When contacted, MP Jakhar said, “The Union government by only following the NCRB data is trying to hide the numbers. The farmers, including those from Punjab, are under heavy stress due to debt and had been committing suicides. Now, the Captain Amarinder Singh government is trying to contain the menace and has announced debt waiver”.
 
 Farm organizations BKU Ekta Ugrahan and BKU Ekta Dakonda have rejected the figures presented in the Parliament. BKU Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said, “As per our survey, nearly 50,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last two decades. The survey conducted even by the state government has not covered all suicides”.
 
 BKU Dakonda president Buta Singh Burjgill said by showing only few suicides the Union government wanted to show Punjab as a prosperous state on the farming account but in reality the famers were highly prone to suicides due to ever-mounting debts.
 
 As per the NCRB report of 2015, bankruptcy or indebtedness and farming related issues were major causes of suicides among farmers.
