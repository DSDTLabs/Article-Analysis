Namakkal: A gang of burglars broke into the house of a college professor in Tiruchengode and decamped with 50 sovereigns of gold, 2kg silver ornaments, a car and an LCD TV.

 According to the Tiruchengode town police, S Ravikumar, 42, a resident of TCS Colony in the town, and his wife Roopa, 36, are working as professors in a private arts and science college in Tiruchengode. The couple has two daughters. Ravikumar’s parents Sengottaiyan, 75, and Senthamizh Selvi, 63, are also living with them.
 
 On Thursday morning, the couple went to their work while their daughters went to school. Sengottaiyan and Senthamizh Selvi have gone to see their daughter in Tiruchengode town. 
 
 When Sengottaiyan and Senthamizh Selvi came to the house for lunch around 1.30pm, they found the front door of the house broken open.
