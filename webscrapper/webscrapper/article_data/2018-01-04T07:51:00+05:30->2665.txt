Ludhiana: Cash of Rs1,97,000, which went mysteriously missing last week from the e-stamping counter of the Mini Secretariat’s   has been fully recovered by the company running the sewa kendra. Surprisingly, none of the staff members employed at the sewa kendra admitted to stealing the cash, but TOI has learnt that the cash was paid back to the company in instalments by some of the employees itself, after company officials threatened to lodge an FIR if the cash was not paid back by the accused until January 3. After the warning, some staff members started paying the stolen amount to the company in instalments.

 Confirming the recovery, Amitabh Gosh, CEO of BLS International (which runs the sewa kendra) said: “Rs1,97,000 cash — which went missing from counter number 17 last week — has been fully recovered by us. Today, we have received the last instalment in this regard.” However, Gosh refused to comment on who paid back the amount to the company, and why he had done so, when no one admitted to stealing the money. But TOI also learnt that since the company had now recovered the entire cash, it may take action against two staffers, whose role was found to be suspicious in the entire case.
 
 This mysterious incident — which put a big question mark on the working of the sewa kendra — occurred last Thursday, when clerk Raman Kumar — who is appointed at counter number 17 of the centre — informed his superiors that Rs1,97,000, out of Rs3,75,000 from his drawer was missing. Adding to the shock of everyone, the CCTVs installed at the sewa kendra were not in a working condition, due to which the theft was not recorded in the cameras.
