Panaji: Responding to tourist   operators’ decision to continue with their   for another day, transport minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said, “If the illegal taxi strike is not withdrawn by Saturday, then the transport department shall invite taxi aggregators like Uber and Ola to operate in the state for which the entire responsibility shall lie upon the office bearers of the taxi union.” 

 Taxi operators in the state have been opposed to the entry of such app-based operators for a long time.
 
 The transport minister’s statement did not go down well with the other alliance partner, GFP.
 
 TCP minister Vijai Sardesai said his party is opposed to getting online cab aggregators like Ola and Uber into the state. Goa can have its own app-based taxi system, he said.
 
 In a statement issued here, Dhavalikar also said that the taxis engaged by the government department, which joined the strike on Friday, will have to face the music. Calling for a report from the departments concerned, he said, “We shall decide on their termination and suspension of permits in due course of time.”
