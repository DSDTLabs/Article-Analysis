CHANDIGARH:   on Tuesday issued notice to the   on a   to ensure   situation was maintained during the ongoing Jat stir for reservation so that people do not face any blockade of roads.

 The matter reached the HC in the wake of a public interest litigation filed by a lawyer, alleging that people sitting on dharnas in various parts of Haryana were likely to block the national highways and state highways for pressing their demands. He submitted that due to such protests, great inconvenience was likely to be caused to a public at large, as seen during the February 2016 protests.
 
 The petitioner sought directions to ensure that all the national highways/state highways/railway tracks falling in the state remained open so that the situation of last yearâ€™s agitation may not occur again.
 
 He alleged that due to previous agitation, various essential services were adversely affected like ambulance carrying the patients, supply of essential commodities like vegetable and milk. 
 
 He pleaded for directions to Haryana chief secretary to take preventive measures to maintain public order throughout Haryana and to take all necessary actions to ensure that free flow of public was not stopped, roads were not jammed, railway tracks were not blocked and government and other properties were not damaged.
 
 Hearing the plea, the HC asked the state government to file its reply by March 15.
