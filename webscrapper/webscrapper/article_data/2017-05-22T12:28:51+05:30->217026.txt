PANAJI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government’s refusal to denounce lynching incidents across the country, especially in BJP ruled states, was encouraging  , the Congress said on Sunday. Party leaders said the BJP government was working to polarize the country in the run up to the 2019  

 “The BJP is concentrating on polarizing the country. They are only working to communalize the vote bank. We cannot expect them to act against extremists groups because the party is trying to divide the country by playing the communal card for election gains,” AICC secretary   said.
 
 Four Muslim men and three Hindus were lynched in the BJP-ruled state of Jharkhand on Thursday. Another man was beaten to death earlier this month in Rajasthan, though the incident has surfaced only on Saturday. “They have already killed innocent people and it’s continuing. The PMO is actively watching the situation and not taking any remedial measures. There is no deterrent in this country as far as the government of India is concerned. So those fringe elements and extremists who are doing this are getting encouraged more and more and this is happening in front of the police,”   and Congress state president   said.
 
 Congress has questioned Modi’s silence on the growing violence across the country against minorities, cattle traders, the deteriorating stability in Jammu and Kashmir and cross border attacks.
 
 “I have not seen a single deterrent action by the Centre. Just shedding crocodile tears does not help. Every decision taken by the central government has led to uncertainty and despair. The steps that they are taking is not as per the ethos and culture of the country and is definitely not as per the Constitution,” he said.
