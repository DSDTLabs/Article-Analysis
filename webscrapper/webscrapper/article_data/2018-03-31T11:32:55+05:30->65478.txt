Mandira Wirk’s show started with Spanish countryside music. And what added to it was the theme set for the show - a romantic beach getaway. The collection was full of flowy gowns in shades of powder blue and lavender, with models sporting sleek back hair, minimal make-up and nude pumps.

  
  
 Miss Supranational 2014 and actress Asha Bhat opened the show for Wirk. The collection also included floral jumpsuits and dresses, with bandanas, big sunglasses and edgy headgears used as statement accessories to go with the bohemian, free-spirited vibe of the collection. Robe dresses completed the beach look. Pocket dresses, kaftans, cold shoulder outfits and laced jumpsuits were also seen on the ramp.
 
  
  
 The showstopper for Mandira’s show, Malaika Arora looked surreal in an all-white sheer dress that had a super sexy back. Her big, bouncy waves and 'barely there' make-up added to the oomph factor of the gown. Talking about the collection, Malaika said, “I love Mandira’s collection. The beachy mood is what I am in right now and the ensembles just completes it for me.”
