NEW DELHI: The enforcement wing of the   seems to have woken up from slumber. In the first large-scale drive since May-June 2016, the department has impounded 50 buses over the past few days. 

 These buses, all from neighbouring states such as Rajasthan, UP and Madhya Pradesh, were ferrying passengers from Delhi to nearby cities without the required permit.
 
 KK Dahiya, special commissioner, said, “The drive was carried out during  . We had received a number of complaints about these illegal buses.”
 
  The buses were part of a large nexus of private buses that pick up passengers from various locations and go to neighbouring towns. None of them had the required permit to operate in Delhi, said Dahiya. “It is a serious matter, especially in terms of safety of passengers.” 
 
 In May-June 2016, the enforcement wing carried out a drive against illegally plying luxury buses that picked up passengers from outside the IGI airport. 
 
 For the current drive, at least 10 teams of five members each were constituted. Most buses operated from outside ISBT Kashmere Gate, Tis Hazari, Dhaula Kuan, Sarai Kale Khan etc and used to go to places such as Agra, Kanpur, Jaipur, Bhiwadi, Ajmer and Indore.
 
 According to Dahiya, the drive is likely to continue for some more days. “Sustained drives will ensure that such buses don’t ply illegally any more,” he said, adding that the department would carry out more such drives. 
 
 The transport department has been facing a staff crunch for some time now, especially with changes in the functioning of the various regional transport offices. A bunch of officials were moved from departments like pollution and others to the regional transport offices to implement the seven-days-a-week functioning of RTOs. 
 
 The move, however, failed to take off as most people were found to visit RTOs during the week, prompting the department to revert to the original schedule of six days. Personnel were also repatriated to their parent departments.
