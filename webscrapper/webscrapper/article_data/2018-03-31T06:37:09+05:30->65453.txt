PANAJI: The process for traders to quote bids for digital fare   to the directorate of transport is under way. 

  (GEL) has set up a centre in the transport department to accept online bids on behalf of the state. “A   owner should not be compelled to buy expensive speed governors or digital   and that’s why we have floated the tender,” said a transport official.
 
 A comparative statement will subsequently be prepared of the five lowest bidders and a proposal will be sent to the government. 
 
 A tender evaluation committee will debate the same but it is up to the government to decide who to hire. “We can empanel all these companies provided they have standard rates,” he added. 
 
 Similar bids have been opened for speed governors.
