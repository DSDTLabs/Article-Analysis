LUCKNOW: A day after he went missing, an eight-year-old boy’s body was recovered from a   on Thursday afternoon in Takrohi area of Indiranagar.

He went missing soon after, said their parents in their complaint. 

 On May 18, locals identified the body as it surfaced on top of the sludge. Angry residents took to the street on Thursday and shouted slogans against LMC for having ignored the deep pits of   around the colony despite repeated complaints. Vijay Kumar Gupta, a resident, said, “Though the government has set up this colony for the poor, nothing has been done to fill up these pits which are death traps for passersby. Every day, people get hurt and slip near them.” The child’s body was later taken for postmortem.
 
 Station officer, Indiranagar, Mukul Verma said, “We registered a missing FIR on the complaint of the boy’s father on Wednesday.”
