  The activists of the Periyar Malineekarana Virudha Samithi have called for stringent action against the police officers who have colluded with the   (CMRL) management in framing false case against their members. 

 They alleged that the top officials of the   were working with the CMRL in targeting the environmentalists who had been fighting against the industrial pollution of   in Eloor. "The government must take immediate action against the corruption within the Board, which has been frequently found guilty of favouritism shown towards certain firms like CMRL. 
 
 The state government should take action against the colluding policemen also," said C R Neelakandan, environmental activist and state convenor, Aam Aadmi Party.
 
 He said that more than 50 lakh people in the state rely on the Periyar river for daily needs and the recent findings indicate the need for governmental interference to protect the river. Among those present at the press conference were environmental activists Anwar C I and M M  .
 
 The North Paravoor police had on Friday last arrested   on a complaint filed by CMRL stating that he had submitted a false report in the Kerala high court in collusion with officials of Eloor surveillance centre of the KSPCB. The Eloor PCB had in 2011 submitted a report on the discolouration of the Periyar alleging that CMRL was behind the water pollution in the area.
 
 The report filed by the environmental surveillance centre says that the discolouration of Periyar in 2011 was due to the illegal discharge from the premises of CMRL through their unauthorized outlet. "Why has the PCB not taken any action against the firm till date since it was found responsible for the pollution way back in 2011? Despite these findings, CMRL was awarded the Excellence award in 2016 by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board," they alleged.
