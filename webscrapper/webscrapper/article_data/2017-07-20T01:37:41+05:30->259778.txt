NEW DELHI:   student leader   has alleged that he is being “systematically harassed” by the university administration as his registration for the monsoon session has been blocked. He claimed that this has been done despite him paying the fine of Rs 20,000 imposed on him for the protests at the administrative block on October 19-20 last year in which the vice-chancellor was gheraoed by students.

 Khalid was told that his registration had been blocked as the inquiry into the screening of the 2015 documentary ‘Muzaffarnagar Abhi Baaki Hai’ by Democratic Student’s Federation was still on.
 
 “I am in the crucial phase of my PhD. When I went to the varsity office to get myself registered, I was told that I have not been cooperating into the inquiry regarding screening of the documentary. However, I had attended the last hearing held last year,”   said.
 
 Another student, Mrityunjay Singh, claimed that he was wrongly included in the list of those being punished. “In the findings, it was written that I was accused of “unsolicited entry” and not “forceful entry” at the 142nd Academic Council meet on December 26, 2016. When I informed the administration about this, they sent me a corrigendum but kept the hostel transfer punishment intact,” he said. 
 
 Vibha Tandon, JNU chief proctor, said, “Every student has a folio page that shows the inquiries going on against them. To say that they do not know is wrong. We are resolving the issues.”
 
 In a related development, JNU had sent a warning letter to former JNUSU secretary Rama Naga earlier this month for “forcible screening of documentary ‘Caste on the menu card’ at the Sabarmati lawns on November 1, 2015”. Naga claimed that he was surprised at getting the letter over a year after the screening of the documentary and claimed that it was “another attempt at criminalising protesters.” However, Tandon had clarified that there were several files that were pending so they were “just clearing them.”
