It was great to see contestants of both the shows present a jugalbandi of sorts for us.” Sneha added, “Since I am one of the judges of Dance Jodi Dance 2, I know all the contestants really well. I have never seen the singers. It is definitely exciting to watch them perform, especially Ramani Ammal and Jaskaran Singh.”
 
 The judges of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, too, were excited about the Maha Sangamam episode. Karthik said, “Music-meets-dance is a lovely concept for television. It is a cute way of showing off our contestants to them and vice versa.” Srinivas added, “It is a perfect sangamam of talents, I must say!” The contestants, too, were eager to meet each other. Varsha said, “ I am happy to have made it to the Top 10 of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. I can now sing without having the tension of going through any elimination.” Kaali, a Dance Jodi Dance 2 contestant, said, “It is an honour to be a part of the show. And this episode, bringing both of us together, is giving us thiruvizha feels.”
