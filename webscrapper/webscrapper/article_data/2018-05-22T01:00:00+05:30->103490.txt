This is a city of   lovers, alright! You have running groups, brisk walkers and boot camping enthusiasts, among the fit-savvy frat. And last Saturday, May 19, women in Mumbai decided to do 108 surya namaskars or the sun salutation, in preparation for   that’s coming up on June 21. This took place at 5.45 am all around the city in different locations — Vile Parle,  ,  ,  , Mira Road, Malad, Navi Mumbai, Bhandup and Mulund, to name a few. 

 
 Says Ajit Pathak who co-ordinated the event, “International Yoga Day is coming up next month and we have planned to have a mega yoga session for the same. So, we decided to do mass surya namaskars to reiterate that yoga is for all and that 108 surya namaskars are quite possible.” So, why 108? “Just like that? That’s just a number,” he says. And if you are wondering how long it took them to do so, it was performed continuously in just about two hours (including warm-ups), with just one break in between for a few minutes.”
 Vidya Dsouza, who did the surya namaskars at Heritage Garden,  , says, “It was such a wonderful experience. I completed mine in 42 minutes! The 12-series posture is a complete body workout and nothing beats the stretch that it gives. Beginners who joined in did 20 or 50 of them.” Chetna Gandecha who conducted the postures at Juhu Beach, adds, “People usually do only 10-12 of the   as it is difficult, but we managed 108. As you breathe in, lift both arms up from the sides and exhaling, it feels so invigorating as the lungs open up. The exercise is a must for people in concrete Mumbai, who are often deprived of an abundance of fresh air and sunlight.”
