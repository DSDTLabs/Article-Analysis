ROHTAK: To express her gratitude to the country Olympics bronze medallist woman boxer   plans to train budding players for major international events at her boxing academy in Manipur. The 33-year-old boxer was in Rohtak on Saturday to attend a function organised by the   (NBA) after she was made its brand ambassador. On February 22, Olympic medallist-turned-professional boxer Vijender Singh was also made the brand ambassador of the  .

 She said her academy   in Manipur was almost ready and would be inaugurated by the Prime Minister as per his schedule. Accompanied by international woman boxer Kavita Chahal, she said that she planned to continue with the sport till a new pugilist defeated her.
 
 “Haryana youth are very energetic and have lots of talent to be groomed as boxing champions. The NBA will give them conducive atmosphere to train under the guidance of experts and experienced hands,” said Mary Kom, who has been five-time world champion.
 
 On amateur boxers turning professionals like Vijender, Mary said it was an individual decision of a player. “The whole idea is to promote a boxer and no one should suffer because of money,” she said.
 
 Striking balance between being a mother,   MP and an international boxer remained a challenge for her, she said, adding that if she could do it, others too could make it big like her. “It is great to see girls taking to boxing after shedding their inhibitions and doing big in the sport,” she maintained. Mary said she had set her eyes for 2020 Tokyo Olympics and had started her preparations for the big event.
