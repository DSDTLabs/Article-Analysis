DEHRADUN: The state   has written to the   (CEOs) of all districts asking them to observe   on June 21. The catch though is that the schools will be closed for summer holidays during this time.
 
  The principals of the schools have been asked to select one teacher each as nodal officer who will get in touch with the students for participation in the programme.
  
  The note sent by the department says that before the vacations begin, the students who are to participate in the celebrations, should be short-listed but their participation should be voluntary.
  
  Summer vacations are set to begin in government schools from May 27 and will continue till June-end. For the  , the principals will have to forward the nodal officers’ names to the CEOs and block education officer (BEO). A day ahead of the International Yoga Day, i.e on June 20, the CEOs and BEOs will hold a meeting with the nodal officers and seek co-operation from the district administration for preparing a final outline of the June 21 programme’s activities.
  
  Teachers say they are not really sure on how the programme will shape up. “We don’t know how many students will voluntarily want to participate in Yoga Day celebrations as at that point of time, summer vacations will be going on. There is confusion as to whether this will be celebrated in one school in each block or in front of block/district education offices”, said a Haridwar-based government school teacher.
  
  When queried about the directions, S B Joshi, who has recently taken charge as the Dehradun district CEO told TOI, “It is voluntary participation when it comes to students and block education officers have also been instructed in this regard. Most likely, we will soon have a meeting to streamline this.”
  
  Meanwhile, former district education officer at Pithoragarh,   said, “On Yoga day, celebrations will be held at a common place in each district.”
