PATNA: The Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, better known as Patna zoo, will ban plastic with less than 50 microns of thickness from June 5. 

 The zoo, which is spread in 152.95 acre area, is home to nearly 800 animals and trees of around 300 species. “The major theme this year will be to discourage the use of plastic and make the visitors aware about the harmful effects of plastic. Plastic with less than 50 microns of thickness will be prohibited on the premises. A notice has been issued by Union ministry of environment and forests to make all zoos, national parks and sanctuaries free from plastic litter by the World Environment Day, which is celebrated on June 5,” a zoo official told this newspaper on Sunday. 
 
 “Plastic materials have turned into one of the biggest environmental hazards. Discarded after usage of just a few seconds, they clog our landfills, drains and rivers before making their way into oceans which then is consumed by sea birds, fishes and mammals. The use of non-degradable plastic product is dangerous to the human health and life. Burning plastic emits dangerous gases which may cause fatal diseases,” he added.
 
 Besides, an exhibition will be put up by the zoo authorities in which various alternative materials of plastic products will be on sale. “We will sensitize the visitors about the harmful effects of using plastic. They will be encouraged to use jute and paper bags. A mini marathon will also be organized on the zoo premises on June 5. Around 200 students will run for 2-3km and stage a street play (nukkad natak) on the same theme,” he added.
