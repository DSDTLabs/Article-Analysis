Chandigarh: Chief minister Amarinder Singh has accused SGPC chief Kirpal Singh Badungar of “obstructing the course of justice” by refusing to appear before the Justice Ranjit Singh Commission probing sacrilege cases in the state.

 “Instead of cooperating with the commission in the interest of the state’s peace and communal harmony, Badungar was refusing to join the investigation, exposing some nefarious interest in covering up the sacrilege incidents,” said Amarinder.
 
 He added that the decision to set up an independent commission to investigate various sacrilege incidents, including the Bargari incident in Faridkot district, was aimed at ensuring that those found responsible for trying to destroy the communal fabric of the state were brought to book. The SGPC, he said, should have welcomed the move instead of adopting a negative approach on it. Amarinder lashed out at the religious institution for issuing misleading statements allegedly at the behest of SAD and said that it seemed to be striving hard to derail the inquiry, probably out of fear of exposure.
 
 While he was not in favour of government interference in the commission’s proceedings, he asserted that he was committed to maintaining peace in the state at all costs. The chief minister said that the SGPC should have raised its voice against various sacrilege incidents. In fact, with several of these incidents reported from gurdwaras, which were under its control and management, the SGPC should have taken on with the task of probing the cases, he added.
 
 One-man commission
 
 The one-man Justice Ranjit Singh Commission was formed by Amarinder Singh-led government in April to inquire into certain incidents of sacrilege reported from Punjab. The government had decided to set up a fresh commission after rejecting the report of the Zora Commission set up by the erstwhile Badal government, terming it ‘inconclusive’.
