PATNA:   and RJD led marches in Patna and across the state on Saturday to highlight the alleged failures of   government over the past four years as well as soaring petrol and diesel prices.

 
  officiating president Kaukab Quadri along with newly appointed   secretaries for   and Rajesh Lilothia led a tricycle rickshaw march from Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport (JPNI) to the party’s headquarters at Sadaquat Ashram to lodge protest against steep fuel price rise.
 
 “We wanted to demonstrate that common man is left with no option but to give up motorized transport owing to the astronomical hike in fuel prices,” Quadri said.
 
 The party also observed the day as ‘Vishwasghat Divas’ (Betrayal Day)’ to mark, what they said, the failures of   government on its fourth anniversary. “While common man is troubled in different manners, we want to specifically mention four important issues — farmers’ distress, failure of foreign policy related to Pakistan and China, plunge in GDP growth rate and fuel price rise. Modi government has weakened the country as well as the common man,” Quadri said.
 
 RJD also took out Aakrosh march and burned effigies of PM Modi in all 38 districts in the state. RJD national vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and state party president Ram Chandra Purbey led the march in Patna against the fuel price rise. “There is anarchy in the country due to steep hike in fuel prices. Petrol in India was Rs70 per litre in 2014 when crude oil was US$140 per barrel. Now, the crude oil prices have come down to US$40 per barrel, but petrol prices in India are still rising. Modi government is putting excessive financial burden on common man,” Raghuvansh said.
