PUNE:   Sunil Ramanand on Tuesday said the   hired by Infosys was operating here though its   had lapsed last November. One of the Bengaluru-based firm’s security guards, Bhaben Saikia (27), deployed on the   at Hinjewadi, was arrested on Monday in connection with the murder of software engineer Rasila Raju OP. 

 Ramanand, who examined the firm’s documents, told TOI, “The security firm, Terrier Security Services (India) Private Ltd, had applied for renewal of its licence. On January 28, we sent a letter to the firm raising a few queries and seeking more documents. The firm is yet to respond to the letter. Despite this, the firm continued to operate.”
 
 Ramanand said it appears that some leeway was provided to the private security firm during the course of renewal of the licence. “However technical the issue may be, the agency should not have functioned if its licence had lapsed. The agency should have initiated the process of renewal of its licence three months before its expiry,” he said.
 
 The firm had taken a valid security licence in 2011 under the provisions of The Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act, 2005. “There are no adverse remarks against the agency in the last five years,” Ramanand said.
 
 The police are checking if legal charges can be invoked against the agency under the provisions of the Act. 
 
 Lt Col Darshan Bal (retd), one of the directors of the security firm, did not respond to calls made by this reporter. Repeated calls made to the board line numbers of the firm did not evoke any response either.
