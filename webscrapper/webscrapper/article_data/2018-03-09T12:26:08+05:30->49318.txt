Finally we decided to go on a strike in February, that was postponed due to a GO. We waited for another 15 days so that the state would fulfil the demands. When that did not materialise, a state-wide strike was called from March 6. But another GO forced us to temporarily halt the strike for two days. The state is unwilling to fulfil our demands. Therefore, we are resorting to a state-wide strike from Friday,” said an AMC medico
