Surat: Union minister of state for highways and fertiliser, Mansukh Mandaviya stated that if foreign multinational companies want to withdraw their medical stents from the market due to government’s price cap, they should also do the same with their medicines. 

 Mandaviya, who visited the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) on Tuesday, stated, “The price cap on medical stent has not gone down well with the foreign multi-national companies from America and Europe. They (multi-nationals) have filed applications to withdraw its coronary stent products from Indian market. If you want to stop selling stent due to price cap, you have to stop selling other medicines, too” Mandaviya added, “It is the government’s move to provide affordable healthcare to the people of this country. The price cap on medical stents has been implemented after series of consultation with the manufacturers, dealers and distributors. The government is soon planning a regulation on the hefty patient charges at the multi-speciality hospitals.”
