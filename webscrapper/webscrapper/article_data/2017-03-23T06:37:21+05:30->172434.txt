PUNE: Pune airport may have trained staff from the ministry of home affairs to handle immigration checks.

 The request was made by airlines in a recent meeting of the Pune airport advisory committee.
 
 “Most airports in the metros and non-metros have trained staff from the ministry of home affairs to handle immigration checks. At Pune airport, the local police personnel man the counters and report to the commissioner and the foreigners’ registration office (FRO) in Mumbai,” an airport official said.
 
 The Pune airport is a profit making airport and needs properly trained staff for immigration checks, he said.
 
 Pune airport director   said at the March 11 meeting that the matter will be taken up with the appropriate authorities.
 
 Until November last year, 4,860 foreign nationals had registered with the FRO in Pune. In 2015, the figure stood at 5,361during the same period. The airport handles around 66 lakh passengers every year.
 
 Officials pointed out that in the midst of ongoing expansion of the airport, changes have to be made at immigration counters too.
 
 “Soon there will be a new terminal building and the passenger traffic will increase. At present four international flights operate from the airport, including two to Dubai (  and SpiceJet), one to   ( ) and one to   (Lufthansa). Though things are still to be decided, at least three airlines are planning flights to more international destinations from Pune. The airport is also going to start e-visa facility, which means more foreign tourists. So, having trained people behind immigration counters is essential,” the official added.
