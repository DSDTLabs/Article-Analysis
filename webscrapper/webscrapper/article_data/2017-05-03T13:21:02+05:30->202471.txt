NASHIK: Pune-based marathoner   (37) is striving hard to secure a place in the   Records by running half marathons of 21km barefoot for 121 days.

 On Monday, he started off his mission running his first half   of the 121 at Shirdi, after seeking blessings of Sai Baba. 
 
 Born in Nashik, Pravin was in Trimbakeshwar on Tuesday. “I have been running barefoot for the past two years. Every day I run for around 12km. I wear a GPS watch and record my runs through a smartphone app. Representatives of the   world records are also keeping track of my running. I contacted Guinness a month ago and got their approval. When I ran for 100 days last June, I had applied to Guinness but did not get approval,” he said.
 
 Last year, he performed a similar feat in a 21-km run for 100 days. He has been running for the past five years and has participated in over 500 marathons till date. Last year he did a similar feat running 21 Km run for 100 days. He has been running for the last five years and has participated in more than 500 marathons till date.
 
 Pravin was a national-level hockey player. In one of his tournaments, a ball hit him in the eye. The athlete received inadequate medical attention and a few days later he found that he had lost his left eye for good. He has been dedicating all his runs to the cause of prevention of blindness.
 
 Tuesday’s marathon began from Stone Ridge Valley. Nashik runners too gave him company.
