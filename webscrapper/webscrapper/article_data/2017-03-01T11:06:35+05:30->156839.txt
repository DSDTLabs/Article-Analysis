ITANAGAR: The   of West Siang has blamed corruption for the collapse of a   at Tirbin in West Siang district on February 15. Seven people, including a pregnant woman, had been injured in the collapse. 

 West Siang   president Marpin Basar squarely blamed the PWD. Basar said the work had not been executed as per the DPR and compromises had been made on the construction material. "Did the department DPR recommend the use of bamboos in the suspension bridge?" he asked.
 
 Basar demanded the government to suspend officers involved in the work. He also asked the government to constitute an inquiry committee to look into the low standard of work executed by the contractors and the department.
 
 One Bajum Boje, a youth of Bege village, had lodged a complaint against the department and contractors with the extra assistant commissioner of Tirbin on February 18, three days after the incident, holding them responsible for the collapse of bridge.
 
 "A free and fair investigation should be conducted so that the truth is unearthed and responsible people booked under the appropriate section of the law," he said, demanding that the government pay compensation to the injured people for medical expenses.
 
 Basar also questioned the role of local MLA in ensuring the quality work of the bridge.
 
 Meanwhile, the committee has also demanded that the local MLA allocate funds from the MLALAD to procure vehicles for the Police Outpost in order to make the police outpost at Tirbin functional.
