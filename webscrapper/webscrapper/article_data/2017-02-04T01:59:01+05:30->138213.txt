The key to beating the dreaded big C is early detection, say most oncologists. Many cancers go undetected in the initial stages simply because men and women have ignored the tell-tale signs, observed the medical experts from the city. 

 Their plea on the occasion of   that falls on February 4 is not to ignore, avoid or be scared of getting a diagnosis done. Cancers are treatable only if detected early and doctors say mandatory and timely check-ups can help counter the dreaded disease.
 
 Dr Tejinder Singh, medical oncologist, Fortis hospital, said, “Things like lumps should not be ignored even if they are not malignant. If   is detected in the early stages, there is a high chance of survival. For example, breast cancer detected in the first stage has a 90% survival rate. But if detected later, the survival rate drops to 30 to 40 %.”
 
 He advises that people should be aware of any unusual changes in their bodies. “Treatment should not be ignored on account of the costs involved. There are many options available and with support groups on hand, cancer should not be feared,” he added. 
 
 Oncosurgeon Dr   said the sooner treatment starts the chances of survival get higher. “Usually those who start treatment in stage 4 won’t survive for more than five years,” he observed.
 
 The symptoms in certain types of cancer that are based in prominent areas are easy to detect unlike other types. 
 
 “Usually these patients approach the doctor at a pre-palpable stage wherein cancer of the pancreas, lungs and ovaries the symptoms are not seen. Often the symptoms are not specific and misunderstood as a stomach ailment or cough and hence neglected,” he added.
