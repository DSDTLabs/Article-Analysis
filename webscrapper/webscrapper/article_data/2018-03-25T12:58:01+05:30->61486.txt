JORHAT: The standoff between the state government and the student community over the status of the   Women's University ( ) ran into its sixth day on Saturday. 

 Students in the upper Assam districts have been protesting against the state government's decision to downgrade the university to a "technical institute". Ironically, the reasons the state government has given for the decision - the lack of a permanent vice-chancellor and the poor infrastructure - are also the reasons the students have been protesting. They want AWU to be declared a full-fledged university and that a full-time vice-chancellor be appointed. They have been arguing that the change in the university's status would mean lower funding, a question over the validity of postgraduate degrees and roadblocks to research activities.
 
 What started out with a 36-hour hunger strike by over 100 AWU students here on Monday soon received support from students across the upper Assam districts.
 
 On Saturday, All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) activists staged sit-in protests, with their mouths gagged, in front of the deputy commissioner's office in   and  , and in front of the subdivisional office in Titabor for two hours. "The government has not taken any steps to meet our demands. Now, we have decided to organize a massive protest at Jorhat soon to discuss the matter,"  , organizing secretary of Aasu, said.   added, "Our agitation will continue till the state government withdraws its decision to convert AWU into a technical institute."
