NAGPUR: Three of the five school vehicle drivers caught for   driving on Friday, were ferrying students from three top private schools. The city traffic police are now working to tighten the screws on 200 plus schools. 

 “We will issue an order through a circular to all schools to check drivers that they should not be in inebriated state before picking up and dropping off schoolchildren,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ravindrasinh Pardeshi.
 
 This rule also applies to all private buses and vans attached to schools. Schools are expected to follow this directive. Stringent action is likely to be taken against schools for failing to comply with this order. “The safety of the children is of paramount importance. School bus drivers found to be under influence while on the job were fined and driving licences are seized,” the   said.
 
 As a part of its ongoing ‘School Safety’ drive launched on January 17, the traffic police till Saturday booked around 1908 drivers ferrying excess children. The highest numbers of offenders were autorickshaw drivers for ferrying excess children in their three-wheelers. It was followed by vans and buses. 
 
 To a query, the DCP clarified that the traffic police action will regularly keep a vigil on vehicles ferrying schoolchildren. “It would not be a mere exercise,” he said. The DCP said that most school buses and private school van operators were under the impression that inspections would be lax after one of two days.
