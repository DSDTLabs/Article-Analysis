AURANGABAD: The district court on Wednesday allowed the Chemists and   plea against the   move to seal its four-storey storey   on January 4. 

 Arguments from both sides were heard on Monday and the district court of H K Bhalerao had reserved the judgment for pronouncement.
 
 On December 31, the   had sealed the 4-storey   after a junior court verdict was issued in its favour. The civic body and the chemists and druggists association have been at loggerheads over the Aushadhi Bhavan built on a nullah for quite a while.
 
 Pramod Patni, a lawyer who represented the   and Druggists Association, told the court that the AMC had issued the building completion certificate to the association in 1992. He added that the question of illegally constructing or occupying the building didn’t arise.
 
 As for violation of lease conditions, the association produced documentary evidence before the court. The civic body had obtained the space on the nullah on the basis of a 99-year lease. Patni also told the court that if the civic body demolished the structure when the suit was pending, it would have served no purpose even if the association won the suit.
 
 The district judge said that there was no prima facie case of violation and so directed the AMC to unseal the Aushadhi Bhavan that houses the association office as well as the shops of wholesale medicines. 
 
 In May 2016, the AMC had sought that the association should vacate the premises within a week or to face action. The civic body had argued that the building obstructs the flow of rainwater as it is built on a nullah leading to waterlogging in and around the Aushadhi Bhavan.
 
 “The association approached the special civic court that had then rejected their plea against the AMC move to seal the premises. The association, however, challenged the lower court order in the district court which allowed the plea on Wednesday,” Patni said.
