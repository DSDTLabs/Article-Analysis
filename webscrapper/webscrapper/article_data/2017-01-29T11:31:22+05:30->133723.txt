KANPUR: National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday started its probe into the   derailment. An eight-member   team led by its IG Alok Mittal reached Pukhrayan in Kanpur Dehat district, 60 kms from Kanpur, where the train had derailed on November 20 last year, causing death of 152 passengers and leaving over 300 injured. 

 NIA is probing the derailment to corroborate the role of Pakistanâ€™s intelligence agency ISI after three of its operatives arrested by Bihar police had stated the derailment to be a terrorist activity. 
 
 The three ISI operatives were arrested in Motihari in Bihar earlier this month. During interrogation, police had learnt about the role of ISI in derailing Indore-Patna Express. The railway ministry had urged the Ujnion home ministry to hand over the probe to NIA so that truth could be unfolded. 
 
 The NIA team which came to Pukhrayan was accompanied by chairman of Railway Safety Board, senior railway officials, police and   officials. The team examined the derailment site and saw the debris of the derailed train. They also gathered evidences from the information provided by the railway officials who had come to the accident site. The NIA team conducted the photography of the site and the mangled remains of Indore-Patna Express, damaged railway tracks, sleepers and overhead equipment.
 
 Mittal said that every aspect related to the derailment is being studied. This is just a preliminary probe and gradually a thorough investigation would be carried out.
 
 Soon after derailment, railways which had started investigation into this case, had suspended some of its officials and staff, considering it to be a case of dereliction of duty.
