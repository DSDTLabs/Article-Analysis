TV's popular actress  , who is currently seen in  , came out in support of   ( ) soldier   over his accusations of poor quality of food served to soldiers on the border and corruption among high-ranking officers.
 
 Tej Bahadur had posted several videos on Facebook alleging that how the soldiers were poorly treated with food that lacked nutrition and hygiene.
 
 
  
 Shocked by the news, Divyanka took to her Instagram account to elaborate on her experiences and extend her support to the soldiers. She also talked about where the government lacked in looking after things. 
  
 Expressing her outrage, Divyanka wrote: "One needs guts to release a video of this kind. Imagine the amount of adversities our soldiers must be going through that compelled this man to address this issue inspite of knowing that it might affect his career. I have experienced a percent of hardships they face, through #NCC, that I was an active part of as a youth. I have had watery daal (lentil soup); a yellow watery preparation with freely floating pieces of carrots in it, which they defined as sabzi and hard Frisby like chapatis. No, I'm not complaining! I'm proud of my experiences and the confidence I got during the process, but I know where this man is coming from.
 Here's where we lack!"
  
 "Our #army, #police and other #forces 'should be' the most well-paid and well-treated professions so that they are content, highly motivated and are secured about the status of the families dependent on them.
 If they are taken care of, they would always be ready to protect, they would never resort to corruption as for them any bribe would be below their stature and honour."
  
 "-Things are improving... I hope our forces are taken care of not only on #SocialMedia but also in practice.
 (PS: It's not about who's right and who's wrong. It's about, what should be done for better functioning.)
