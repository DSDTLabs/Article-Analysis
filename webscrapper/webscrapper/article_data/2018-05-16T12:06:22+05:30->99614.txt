Kolkata witnessed a unique cricket match on Monday at a city college when the cast and crew of Bengali film   played against KKR. This KKR, however, stands for   — a team made of Upper Nursery students from a city Montessori. “During the months of May-June we wait for the IPL and a film by Nandita (Roy) and Shiboprosad (Mukherjee). So I thought, why not combine the two,” said Anurag Chirimar, the chief organiser of the event. 

 
 The volunteers at the event had a real tough time managing the kids. The children, clearly unaware of the rules of cricket, roamed around the ground. 
  
  
 Prithviraj Sen and Supratim Saha were seen having fun with the plastic safety cones and wore them as hats. “I want to take this to my house,” said Supratim to a volunteer, who was was trying to convince them to keep it on the boundary line. Meanwhile, Riddhi Paul picked up a wicket and sprinted to her mother. “When I first received the invitation, I thought it was the real team Kolkata, but this KKR team is even better,” said  .
