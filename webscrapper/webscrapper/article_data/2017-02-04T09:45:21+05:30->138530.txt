 Radhika Aggarwal, cofounder of ShopClues, pegs the   marketplace’s valuation at over $1.1billion; the Tiger Global-backed venture claims to be on track to break even by year ended March 2018. “We will be ready to list by year-end,” Aggarwal says.
 
 PolicyBazaar, an online financial products platform that has raised .`500 crore since inception in June 2008, is also eyeing a Nasdaq listing. “We are   to the idea,” says cofounder Alok Bansal. The company, funded by Tiger Global and Premji Invest, claims to be on track to break even by the end of the current fiscal year.
 
 GirnarSoft chief financial officer Umesh Hora maintains that it may be worth exploring listing as the US platform is the go-to stock exchange for growth-oriented tech companies.
 
 MMT cofounder Deep Kalra believes this may be the right time to list as the ecosystem is maturing, even as another round of high-value funding looks tough. Yet, a Nasdaq listing calls for robust corporate governance and excellent processes. Do Indian Internet firms have all that?
