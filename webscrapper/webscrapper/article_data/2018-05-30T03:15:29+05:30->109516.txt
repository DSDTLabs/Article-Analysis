MUMBAI: A simple game of hide and seek landed IIT-Powai's   student Aiman   in hospital, in middle of board exams. 

 Aslam fell in a 15ft ditch and suffered multiple fractures on her right hip. The incident took place after her social studies paper, five days before the next exam. She score 92.5%. 
 
 "Two more papers were left and I had to study in the hospital. However, I was determined not to miss my exams and score a good grade," Aslam told TOI. 
 
 She was taken to the nearest school from her hospital in an ambulance, where she wrote her exams in a reclining wheelchair. Aslam and her family did not view skipping the exam as an option, and were not going to let a freak accident come in the way of her academic success.
 
    hopes to pursue ethology at a city college.
