BIHARSHARIF: At least six policemen were injured on Monday in stone pelting by a mob protesting against lynching of innocent people and attack on Amarnath pilgrims. Police resorted to lathicharge and a few protesters also sustained injuries. Over 60 of them were arrested.

 Around 500 people, claiming to be members of civil society, took out a procession from Soghra College under Laheri police station area in Biharsharif to Hospital Mor to protest mob lynching of innocent people and attack on Amarnath yatris. The mob turned violent and started pelting policemen with stones. The protesters were carrying placards which read ‘Not in My Name’. 
 
 The district administration had denied permission to the organizers for security reasons but they insisted on carrying out the procession, Nalanda DM Thiyagarajan SM said. The DM said he had asked some of them to meet and hand over the memorandum to him.
 
 Nalanda SP Kumar Ashish said allowing such procession might have created law and order problem as people of other community visit temples to perform puja on ‘Somvari’. He said the protesters attacked policemen and six of them sustained injuries. He said the arrested people were sent to jail.
