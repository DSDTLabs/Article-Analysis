HYDERABAD: In a blow to their hallowed status, out of the five colonies that won the Swachh award in the south zone of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, three continue to be bogged down by bad roads.The areas that have swerved off expectations are Housing Board Colony in Bahadurpura, Saraswathi Nagar Colony in Malkpet Circle and   in Attapur. In some good news though, residents say the roads in   and in Madhav Nagar Colony in Saidabad division remain in good condition.

 The Housing Board Colony in Bahadurpura has several potholes and dug-up roads. Locals in the area want authorities to restore the roads on priority. “The bylanes in these areas were restored years ago and have fallen on bad days.They need immediate attention,“ said Narasaiah Uppal, secretary of the colony . Highlighting the plight of people re siding in the colony , he said, “The main road which is the entrance to our colony has been dug up. During rains, slush make roads slippery .“
 
 Residents also suffer due to overflowing sewage water.“Crossing this stretch has become a tough task. There were days when I had to return home, just to change my clothes as vehicles would squash water while passing by,“ said Mohammed Ashwaq, resident of Housing Board Colony in Bandlaguda. He also complained about rancid smell from sewage water.
 
 In Saraswathi Nagar, Malkpet Circle, civic author ities did take up some restoration work, but poor execution left this stretch with uneven patches. Potholes were spotted and parts of road are also eroded. Funds have been sanctioned, but road repair is on hold due to monsoon. “We have requested   to start work after monsoon," said   secretary of that colony. Several main roads and by-lanes in residential areas in south zone are also in bad condition.   Market road, by-lanes in Chatrinaka, Baba Nagar wear a battered look.
