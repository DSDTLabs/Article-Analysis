SHIMLA: In peak   season, when around 15,000 to 20,000 tourists visit Shimla, hoteliers are forced to cancel most bookings due to acute water shortage in the hill town. Many hotels have already started the process of cancelling advance bookings and refunding the money as they are not able to provide water to guests. On an average, they are spending Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 to arrange water through private tankers. 

 
 It is not just hoteliers and restaurant owners of Shimla who are worried about the  . The Shimla district administration has also suspended the   festival held at the Ridge from June 1 to 5. Sanjay Sood, owner of Devicos Restaurant on   said he is buying 6,000 litres of water from a private tanker for between Rs 8,000 to 9,000 on a daily basis. "We are not allowing the guests to use washrooms except in an emergency situation as there is no water available for toilets," he said.
