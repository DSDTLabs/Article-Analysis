 Addressing the media on Monday at the national conference on e-Governance, the minister said most of the fake currency and hawala money were used to encouraging violence in Jammu and Kashmir and Maoist violence and unrest in the northeast region of the country. 
 
 “The government received information that two fake Indian currency printing press in Pakistan were shut down after the demonetisation drive was launched by the union government. Within two months, the country saw what demonetisation can do”, he said.
