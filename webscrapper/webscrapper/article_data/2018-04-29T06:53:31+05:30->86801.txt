MUMBAI: Directorate Revenue of Intelligence (DRI) on Saturday arrested the kingpin of the Rs 10-crore duty drawback racket, Arjun  , a   agent.

 
 According to investigators, the drawback, given as incentive for exports, was held back in some cases for investigation by the customs department. The fraudsters allegedly procured the details and got the money released and diverted it to different accounts.
 
 Last week, the   unit had arrested two businessmen and a customs agent—Sadruddin Lassanwala, Ramesh Singh and Mohammed Shaikh alias Arif.
 
 “Goregaonkar would hand over details of exporters whose reimbursement had been put on hold to Lassanwala and Singh,” said an official. Two deputy commissioners are under the scanner too.
 
 “The two would give exporters’ details to Arife who would open new accounts in their names,” he added.
 
 The accused would then apply to customs for change of bank accounts of the exporters in their system. Goregaonkar used his influence to ensure the exporters got a clean chit and the drawbacks disbursed, but without them getting any alerts.
