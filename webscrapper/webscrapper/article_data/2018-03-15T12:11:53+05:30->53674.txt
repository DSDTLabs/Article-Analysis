TRICHY: Idol trafficker   was attacked in the   central prison on Wednesday. He sustained minor scratches after being slapped by S Yuvaraj, another inmate lodged in the high security block.

 International idol smuggler   Kapoor was lodged in Trichy central prison after he was arrested in Germany in 2016. Yuvaraj who was lodged in the Vellore prison was shifted to Trichy central prison on March 1 over security reasons. He is accused of murdering an engineer graduate   in Namakkal district.
 
 According to prison sources, Subhash was washing his clothes using water from common tap when Yuvraj objected to the wastage of water from tap. Yuvraj asked him to close the tap in English but Subhash refused to do so and asked him to mind his own business. After a brief altercation, Yuvraj started slapping Subhash and prison guards came to his rescue on hearing his cries.
 
 Following a complaint from Subhash, prison superintendent   summoned both of them. Nigila warned both of them of action if they repeated the same and let them off. She was however unavailable for comments when contacted. TNN
