BENGALURU: Drivers working for cab aggregators say all the talk of trip-based incentives is a smokescreen given the city's crawling traffic, and the huge increase in the number of cabs on city roads makes it difficult to get trips.

 They allege the cab companies are aggressively promoting schemes to augment their fleets.“For example, Ola has an offer where it buys vehicles on behalf of the driver, who has to pay in installments the car cost to be its owner later. This is bringing more cabs on the road and eating into our trips. On the other hand, we are given impossible targets to complete 20-odd trips a day for which we will have to work for 18 hours a day. Even this won't help as we don't get trips after dropping passengers in areas on the city outskirts,“ says Tanveer Pasha, head, Ola-TaxiForSure-Uber ( ) Drivers' and Owners' Union.
 
 Another cabbie says the in centives announced are pared down considerably in the form of various cuts like 20% com pany commission and that the apps are rigged in such a way that aggregator-owned cabs get preference over others.
 
 Cab drivers say Cab drivers say they were earning fairly well but the scene changed once the fare cuts began and incentive system was introduced. “Only 24 days ago, I quit my job at a liquor market thinking I will be able to make more money as a cab driver. I was earning Rs 40,000 there. Now I earn less than Rs 20,000. I can't connect with my aggregator on the platform as I have not bought my vehicle through Ola.It reduces my chances of making the required number of trips. Owner-cum-drivers are made to wait for long hours at the air port before assigning trips. I had to wait for eight hours one day at the airport recently to get a trip. Later, I understood how the backend system works,“ said another driver, a BBM student of  .
