The flyover in front of the the airport, the grade separator at Kathipara, the Thiruvi-ka bridge over  , the DMDK office in   and   junction on OMR are among the 48 accident black spots identified by the traffic police along with IIT-M which conducted a study.

 The study said the issue could be addressed through accident investigation and prevention techniques. A team of experts analysed the accident data, identified the natures and causes of accidents, and designed appropriate low-cost engineering solutions.
 
 Of the areas identified, the city's northern part has 17 spots, including SN Chetty Street, Royapuram, Sathangadu junction, Kavangarai junction and   ( ), while the west zone, including areas like   and Koyambedu, has 12 spots. There are four such spots in the east zone, including in Adyar, and 15 spots in the south zone, including in places like Meenambakkam and Guindy. The study, pointing out that engineering interventions were accepted as proven methods to reduce accidents and accident severity at black spots worldwide, put forth both short and long-term measures to be implemented to curb accidents.
 
 It suggested putting up pedestrian crossings, signals and lane markings in places like Poonamallee High Road and  , and said signals at places like Koyambedu, DMDK office, Alapakkam junction, DMDK office, Vembuliamman Kovil, Koyambedu, Kathirvedu junction near Red Hills needed to be repaired. It also recommended laying footpaths along Chennai-Tiruvallur High Road (CTH).
 
 The traffic police, who have already started implementing some suggestions, said the results were positive in a few places.
 
 “We have taken various measures to prevent accidents, especially at these 48 places. We have initiated the short-term measures which have led to a remarkable reduction in road accidents,” said deputy commissioner, traffic, south, P Swaminathan.
