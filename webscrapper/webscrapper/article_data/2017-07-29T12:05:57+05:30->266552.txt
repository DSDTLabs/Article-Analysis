VADODARA: Students of BSc interior design course of M S University’s Faculty of Family and Community Science continued their protest for the second day against lack of facilities provided by the university. 

 On Friday, students wearing black t-shirts staged a protest at the university head office. 
 
 The students were holding placards stating ‘reduce fees or provide facilities’, ‘we want justice’, ‘we are not ATMs’, ‘we need studio not four walls’ and ‘we pay Rs one lakh not to fill your pockets’. 
 
 Later, they also submitted a memorandum to   vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas highlighting their problems ever since they got enrolled in the three years honours programme which is being run by the university on higher payment basis. 
 
 In the memorandum, the students group, stated that even as they pay Rs one lakh as annual fees, there is no masters programme putting their future at risk. 
 
 “Whenever, we raise the problems faced by us, we are assured that a new building is being constructed for the course. But, we have already entered into third year and yet we have not been allocated a single class,” the memorandum signed by the students group said. 
 
 Earlier, on Thursday, the group had highlighted their problems before registrar  , who is also the head of the Department of Family and Community Resource Management which runs the course. But according to the students,   failed to provide any satisfactory response to them.
