Rajkot: Exactly like the   warehouse fire, where groundnut worth Rs 35 crore was gutted, the investigation in May 5 fire in   godown, was also caused due to a welding spark.

 CID (crime), which was handed over the probe in the fire, has concluded that welding work being carried out near a shade led to the blaze that gutted 28,000 groundnut bags each weighing 35 kg worth Rs four crore. The construction of new shade was being carried out near-by, it is claimed.
 
 . The welding was being done on the the instruction of warehouse owner Narendra Patel. Sources also claimed that there was no electricity connection in the warehouse but a team of PGVCL has found that an illegal electricity connection was taken from nearby warehouse. Four of the total eight shades were gutted.
 
 However, questions are being raised against  , the government-designated agency to procure groundnut at minimum support price, as no lessons were learnt from the Gondal incident.
 
  has raised the question of quality of groundnut that was gutted.
