INDORE: BJP MP   recalled how he broke down after reading a suicide letter written by the   PhD scholar Rohit Vemula before he hanged himself on the campus in January 2016.

 “Rohit Vemula, a dalit PhD student from Hyderabad committed suicide last year. When I read his letter, I broke into tears. Rohit wrote that he was taking the extreme step because he had committed the sin of taking birth in such form. This line pained my heart immensely,” Varun said.
 
 He was delivering a lecture on “Ideas for a new India,” organised by a private school here.
 
 Rohit's suicide had kicked up a huge uproar across the country, with protests by many dalit organisations and opposition parties to seek 'justice' for the deceased. Union minister and BJP leader   was booked along with others for allegedly abetting Rohit's suicide.
 
 The MP, who represents Sultanpur seat in Uttar Pradesh, also referred to an incident pertaining to discrimination with dalits, which had occurred in   in Madhya Pradesh last month.
 
 “Seventy per cent kids in a school didn't eat their lunch under the mid-day meal scheme for quite some time as the food was cooked by a woman belonging to a weaker section. What are we teaching our kids? After all, where is this country and world heading for?” he asked.
 
 Varun said “though Constitution didn't discriminate along the caste and religion basis, the fact is 37 per cent dalits in the country are below poverty line (BPL).”
 
 He said eight per cent dalit children die before celebrating their first birthday.
 
 “Dr   had said we don't need political democracy but social democracy. His thought was way ahead of his time,” Varun said.
