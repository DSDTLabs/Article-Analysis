CHENNAI: The ruling   today hit out at actor   saying he does not understand that his utterances against the government will "affect" him later and opposition parties which support him now will "leave him in a lurch" in due course of time.

 AIADMK's mouthpiece 'Namadhu Dr MGR' today said the Opposition parties including the   have begun voicing their support for the 'Viswaroopam' star who has spoken against the state government due to "over enthusiasm."
 
 It may be recalled that the top actor has been targeting the state government on issues including alleged corruption and incidence of dengue.
 
 "Due to this (support of parties), he is perceiving that the entire   stands behind him and has been expressing opinions everyday against the government," the Tamil daily said in its front page write-up highlighted as a "box-item."
 
 "Though his emotionally charged deeds and utterances will put him in limelight for now, he does not understand the extent to which it will affect him later."
 The daily which headlined the article as "Kamal Haasan in Trishanku's heaven," said the   host "should realise that the parties that voice support for him will leave him in the lurch in due course of time."
 
 Parties that were working against the government look at using the actor to their advantage, the daily said.
 
 If the actor, without understanding it made a "miscalculation," that the entire Tamil Nadu and political parties were behind him, it is a "plain truth" that he will have to face the "consequences."
 
 Following Haasan's recent outburst against the government, several ministers had spoken against him.
 
 Chief Minister K Palaniswami had on July 19 said that the government will give him a reply if he joins politics.
