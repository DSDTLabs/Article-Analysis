BENGALURU: Passengers travelling on   AC buses will soon have access to infotainment facilities. 

 Two high-definition televisions will be installed in each bus, on which passengers can watch entertainment and informative programmes, live weather reports, train and flight timings, DD news and bus stop announcements.
 
 BMTC officials said 15 buses will get infotainment facilities in the first phase; the project is likely to be extended to 250 buses. The corporation has more than 800 AC buses.
 
  This is the second time that BMTC will introduce the facility. Earlier, four 19-inch LCD screens were installed in each bus, particularly on the airport route, but the private firm behind the initiative backed out of the arrangement. The firm selected for the project will have to generate revenue through advertisements on the screens. "The idea is good but BMTC and the private firm should make it a point to maintain the facility," says S  , a BMTC passenger. 
 
 BMTC has decided to extend discounts for passengers travelling by   buses till May. On January 1, the corporation had announced reduction in AC bus fares ranging from 5% to 37%, with an average fare reduction of 29%, on a trial basis. The initiative was targeted at weaning away passengers from cab firms like Ola and Uber.
