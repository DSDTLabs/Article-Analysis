The upcoming Kannada film  's melodious soundtrack has been the talk of the town ever since it's release three weeks ago. Directed by PC   and music composed by  , the film is about the life of two visually-impaired lovers, played by   and Bhama. Speaking about the music, says Arjun, “Raaga is one of those movies which is very special for any music director to compose music for. Emotions run deep throughout the movie, using music as a medium of communication between two lovers who are blind. That gives a lot of scope for exploring with melody . In fact, I'd say the solo violin is a character by itself in the movie.“While the song   has been sung by Armaan Malik, Belakindare is a classical qawwali mix. Manasina's melody and violin make it a beautiful track, and Yaare Nee, a sad song sung by  , has a very raspy, realistic touch to it.   says, “All four songs in the film have a very realistic, retro feel to them.I had to make sure that they matched the visuals from the film. The biggest challenge was to strike a balance between making the songs sound unique and familiar at the same time to the audience. Plus we had to make sure they're commercially well received too.“
The composer speaks highly of the director when it comes to collaborating with him for the movie. “Our job as composers becomes easy when directors have a good knowledge of music, and know exactly what they want. Working with PC Shekar was very good in that aspect. I had a really pleasant time composing music for Raaga,“ says Arjun.
