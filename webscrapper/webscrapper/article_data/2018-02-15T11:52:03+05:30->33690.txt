CHENNAI: Almost 13 years after a courier firm failed to ship a man's birthday gift to his girlfriend on time, a consumer   in the city recently directed the company to pay him 4,000 in compensation for the mental agony he underwent and other costs incurred. 

 However, as irony would have it, K   (name changed) appears to be unaware that he has finally won the prolonged legal battle as his cheque is still lying in the office of the automobile firm in   where he worked at the time. Staff at the office are unaware of his current whereabouts and even his advocate is unable to trace him. 
 
 In his petition, Vijay said that he bought a doll worth 2000 and shipped it to his girlfriend in Mumbai through a leading courier firm in Chennai in 2005. 
 
 On his enquiry before booking the consignment, staff at the cash counter assured him that the parcel would be delivered within two days, his petition said.
 
 "He was keen on ensuring that the gift reached Mumbai the day before his girlfriend's birthday," recalled an ex-colleague from the automobile firm in Guindy.
 
 Vijay said he was eagerly waiting for a call from Mumbai but it did not arrive. He realised the gift didn't reach her on time. He immediately made a phone call to the courier firm seeking an explanation but there was no response, Vijay claimed.
 
 The callous attitude of the staff when he went to enquire in person left him irked and Vijay sent a legal notice, to which there was no response either. Despite agreeing that the consignment was not delivered on time, the courier firm argued that they would be able to pay only 100 as per their terms and conditions. 
 
 After listening to both sides, the forum ordered the courier firm to pay the cost incurred towards buying the doll, a compensation of 2,000 towards the mental agony Vijay underwent and 2,000 over and above this towards other costs to the complainant.
