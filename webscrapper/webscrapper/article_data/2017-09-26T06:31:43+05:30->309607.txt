MUMBAI: Over a year after a girl from Cuffe Parade was molested inside the   subway at Fort, BMC has decided to install 32   cameras inside the subway to keep an eye on miscreants. It will cost BMC approximately Rs 11.70 lakh.Each camera would be placed approximately 15-20m from each other. Footage will be handed over to the police as well as BMC's disaster control room.

 On January 30, 2016, the college student was molested in the Metro Junction subway while returning home. However, it took the girl three weeks to muster the courage to tell her mother about the incident, who insisted on filing a police complaint and visiting the spot. They found the accused loitering around the subway . The mother immediately called the police who picked him up.
 
 The   railway station subway as well as the   railway station subway already have CCTV cameras. “The Metro junction subway is the longest compared to the other two and, therefore, we are keen on installing these cameras. Work order for installation will be issued by Tuesday ,“ said BMC `A ' ward office assistant municipal commissioner  .
 
 Meanwhile, activists said it was a good move. “From the safety point of view, this is much required and it is good the BMC is considering installation of cameras,“ said RTI activist Anil Galgali.
