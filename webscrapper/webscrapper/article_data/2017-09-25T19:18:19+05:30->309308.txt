TIRUPUR: The   city police on Monday arrested 16 youths, mostly   students, for rampaging a government hostel for   college students here on Sunday.

 The rampage happened in the government hostel for adi dravidar students situated on the premises of the Chikkanna Government Arts College.
 
 According to the college sources, there was a dispute between some of the hostel inmates and day scholars. Authorities warned both the groups and asked them to sort out the issues amicably. 
 
 On Sunday, a few day scholars and their friends – all wearing masks -- trespassed into the hostel and rampaged the hostel properties and also the inmates’ belongings, including motorcycles and laptops.
 
 “Since many inmates are part-time workers, most of them were there on Sunday. Only around 10 students including me were there. We came to know that the gang was planning to attack. So we escaped from the premises. Later, the armed gang damaged the properties and also assaulted our cook, Velusamy,” said one of the students.
 
 The Tirupur North police arrested all the sixteen youths who indulged in the crime. They were booked under various sections of the IPC and the   Property Prevention of Damage and Loss Act. The accused were remanded in judicial custody.
