PATNA: Two senior   functionaries – leader of opposition in state assembly Prem Kumar and former minister Nand Kishore Yadav – on Monday skipped the ‘bhoj (feast)’ hosted by   for the MLAs and MLCs cutting across political parties. The two gave separate reasons for their last-minute change in plan to participate in the feast. Other BJP netas, however, attended the feast.
 
  The CM on Monday resumed his practice of hosting annual feast for the MLAs and MLCs after a gap of three years. He had stopped organising the feast after snapping ties with BJP that led to the fall of   government in the state in June 2013.
  
  Invitations had been sent to every   and MLC soliciting their participation in the feast. Till the morning on Monday, Prem and Nand Kishore were in mood to participate in the feast. Even during the post-lunch session of the state assembly, there was palpable excitement about it, and   member Bhai Birendra even teased Prem on the floor of the House, saying if he had entered the   later because he had been trying to find out the menu planned for the feast!
  
  However, by the evening, both Prem and Nand Kishore threw a surprise by declining to attend the feast hosted by the CM. Although Nand Kishore could not be contacted, sources close to him said “he was out of the town”.
  
  Prem, however, was forthright. “In the morning, I had said that I would participate in the feast, but a lot of things – like lathicharge on Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik protesters and ‘anganwadi’ workers – happened. Besides, the government has not been holding dialogue with representatives of home guard jawans on their demands,” he said. “The invitations have been sent to the MLAs and MLCs individually. Everyone is free to exercise his/her choice. I decided to skip the feast,” he added.
