 “The CMB can give urgent consideration to various opportunities for both demand management and supply augmentation, so that the reduced water allocation does not affect the productivity and income security of the numerous small farms of Tamil Nadu,” he said in a statement issued on Saturday.
 
 Swaminathan said the CMB should include eminent water technologists and agriculture specialists. “While Tamil Nadu and Karnataka continue their conversation on sharing of  , it would be useful to take advantage of the important recommendation made by the Supreme Court for establishing a CMB speedily. In my view, such a board can help ensure greater economy and equity in sharing water by giving importancetodemand management and supply augmentation,” he said.
 
 As part of the demand management, alltheCauvery basin states should reduce the demand for water by introducing cropping patterns requiring less water and by adopting drip irrigation and other water saving techniques.
 
 “The cropping system requiring less water should pay attention to crops which are in demand in the market and which can enhance the income of farmers per unit of water,” said Swaminathan. As the Supreme Court has said there is scope for Tamil Nadu benefiting from its underutilised aquifer, the only method of augmentation is mandatory rainwater harvesting.
