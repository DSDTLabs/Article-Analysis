PANAJI: With work on a detention centre at the   sub-jail not meeting satisfactory levels, the social welfare department has asked the public works department ( ) to take up the work again. 

 The social welfare department has also moved a file for recruitment of about 20 employees to start the centre.
 
 Officers of social welfare, PWD and police department recently conducted an inspection of the detention centre. 
 
 “The work was not satisfactory and we have asked the PWD to take it up again. It will again prepare the estimates and tender the work,” a social welfare officer said.
 
 The police department has spent about Rs 19 lakh on the work of the centre. 
 
 It had put up a proposal for a detention centre to lodge foreign nationals who are found staying illegally in the state and awaiting deportation. 
 
 Without a detention centre, these foreign nationals are able to move about freely in the state.
 
 Police said most of the African nationals, especially those from   who are involved in drug trade, do not have any document to prove their nationality. 
 
 When they are arrested, they are produced before the court and after obtaining bail, they move freely in the state.
 
 In fact, some foreign nationals even deliberately choose to get arrested under narcotics cases to extend their stay in Goa, sources said.
 
 Sources said the PWD will also undertake renovation work on the Mapusa sub-jail soon. 
 
 In February 2016, 70 inmates of the sub-jail were shifted to the new Colvale jail and the premises were kept under lock and key. 
 
 The shifting was done on the recommendation of a team from the Academy of Prisons and Correctional Administration, Vellore. 
 
 In their report, the team had recommended shifting of inmates from the sub-jail, Mapusa, as the building was in a precarious condition.
