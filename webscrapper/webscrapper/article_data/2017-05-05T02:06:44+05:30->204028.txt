GHAZIABAD: Even as 128 private CBSE-affiliated schools in   remained closed on Thursday in a   against the district administration panel’s proforma demanding disclosure of their financial accounts, the administration said it did not issue the second page of the proforma that seeks financial details from schools.

 Also on Thursday, a delegation of representatives from the federation of private schools in Ghaziabad met district magistrate Ministhy S seeking protection from the protesting parents agitating against the ‘arbitrary’ fee hike issue. A memorandum was submitted to the district magistrate by the Ghaziabad chapter of   (ISFI) seeking recusal from disclosing their financial accounts.
 
 Referring to the proforma issued by the three-member administration committee, ISFI president Subash Jain told TOI, “The proforma (with the DM’s signature on it) has queries pertaining to affiliations, registrations, NOCs, fire clearances and so on. In several proformas, a second unsigned page has been attached which asks for financial statements, bank account summaries of the past three years, teachers’ salaries and so on..”
 
 The federation said the administration has asked school managements to only respond to those queries in the proforma that bear the DM”s valid signature.
 
 District administration officials have denied having asked about the financial details of schools and suspect foul play in the matter. “The administration sent a proforma to schools asking them to furnish details on a set of 17 points. This single-page proforma is in Hindi and is countersigned by the ADM (Finance & Revenue) and the DIOS apart from the DM. The second page of the proforma received by some schools is unsigned and in English, and was never issued by the district administration. It seems someone has played some mischief.,” ADM (F&R) Rajesh Yadav told TOI.
