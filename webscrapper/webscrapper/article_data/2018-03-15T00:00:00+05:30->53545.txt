After Thupparivaalan,   has finalised his next script, which will feature   in the lead. The actor posted a picture with director Mysskin and cinematographer PC Sreeram and tweeted saying, “MY NEW BIRTH... bless me” (sic). Well, it sure surprised many, especially since it is the actor’s 10th year in  . Though Shanthnu is tight-lipped about the genre and his role, the actor says that he is extremely delighted about his “new beginnings”. “This is like my first film and I have no words to explain my happiness,” begins Shanthnu, adding, “People used to say that I have made so many mistakes in my past. But I learned so much. This film will be a re-birth for me. I am going to surrender to sir.” 

 On working with Mysskin, he says, “We met at an audio launch and he told me that I have changed quite a bit. He said we will work soon. I was happy, but didn’t expect much. A week later, he called me saying that he had finished penning his next and that I will be playing the lead. I was shocked and met him at his office. It is a dream-come-true moment for me to work with Mysskin sir and PC sir. The kind of character Mysskin sir sketches is phenomenal... I am certain that it will be a breakthrough for me as an actor. I want to thank all my well-wishers who hoped the best for me.” The pre-production work has begun and the team is finalising the rest of the cast and crew.
