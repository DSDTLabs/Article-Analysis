VADODARA: In a sort of a musical chair, Vadodara taluka police station has seen three police sub-inspectors (PSI) holding the charge in last one month. 

 Last week, when the current PSI went on leave, the PSI of Bhadarva police station was given charge.
 
 PSI K V Lakod was transferred from the taluka police station to the Vadu police station January 16 and PSI S   was transferred to taluka police station. 
 
 Meanwhile on January 30, the state monitoring cell raided a farm in   village, which comes under the jurisdiction of taluka and seized Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth Rs12.45 lakh.
 
 After the incident, Vaghela was transferred to Gandhinagar CID (crime) after his transfer orders came from the office of DGP. 
 
 The then traffic PSI N B Barot was asked to replace Vaghela. However, before Barot was given the charge of the police station, his five-day leave was already approved.
 
 In the absence of Barot, Bhadarva PSI K J Zala was asked to hold charge of taluka police station.
 
  On February 9, when   was attacked and burgled near the city by eight unidentified men, a woman PSI of taluka police station had to rush to the college in the morning.
 
  Zala reached the spot later during the day as he was holding dual charges of Bhadarva and taluka police stations.
 
 Superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural),   told TOI: “These were routine transfers. However, Vaghela was transferred by DGP’s office.”
 
 The jurisdiction of Vadodara taluka police station is strategic as it begins immediately after the city police’s jurisdiction ends. Sources in the rural police said the police station’s jurisdiction stretches for at least 10 kilometre on the eastern and western sides of the city.
