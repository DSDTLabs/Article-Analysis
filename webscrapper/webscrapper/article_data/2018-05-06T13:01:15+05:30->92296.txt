KOCHI: Drivers who frequently use high-intensity vehicle horns are at the risk of getting harmed, doctors said.

 
 "The bus drivers and auto drivers are the most affected. Most of them are on the road for more than 12 hours. The constant exposure can be extremely harmful to them," said Dr V D  , ENT surgeon,  .
 
 He added even those who drive their vehicles only for a couple of hours could face the risk.
 
 “There are two kinds of hearing loss, temporary threshold shift and permanent threshold shift. When people are suddenly exposed to dangerously loud noises, they are at risk of suffering severe hearing loss. Similar damages are also caused due to constant and prolonged exposure to relatively less loud noises,” said Dr  , ENT specialist.
 
 Pradeep Kumar said that sound levels at areas like Pallimukku, SN junction, Palarivattom and   in   can get as loud as 105 dB during peak hours.
 
 “When someone is exposed to loud noises their hair cells in cochlea, which sensory receptors for auditory signals, get damaged. But once they are relieved of that noise they automatically recover. If you are constantly exposed to loud noises, recovery is difficult,” said Pradeep Kumar.
