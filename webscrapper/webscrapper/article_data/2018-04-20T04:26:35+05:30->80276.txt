AHMEDABAD:   on Thursday afternoon arrested a key accused in the bitcoin extortion case, police inspector Anant Patel, from near a   in Adalaj. 

 Patel was on the run since CID crime registered an FIR on April 8, for the kidnapping of Surat-based builder Shailesh Bhatt and extortion of bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore from him.
 
 Crime branch ACP C N Rajput said they kept watch at a particular paan shop after being tipped off. “Patel arrived in a car and we arrested him as he approached the shop. He had shaved his head and worn a camouflage cap to hide his identity,” added Rajput.
 
 Crime branch officials said they handed Patel over to CID crime for further investigation.
 
 CID crime officials said Patel, an inspector in Amreli local crime branch, along with other policemen allegedly kidnapped Bhatt from Ahmedabad and held him captive at a farm near Dehgam.
 
 “According to the FIR, Patel extorted bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore and forced him to pay another Rs 32 crore in cash through an angadia service, before he was let go. The angadia operator sensed foul play and did not transfer the money,” a CID crime official said.
 
 Senior CID crime officials said the role of Amreli SP Jagdish Patel is also being probed.
 
  “As of now there is no evidence against the SP. His statement has been recorded and we will call him again if needed,” an investigator said.
 
 CID crime is also probing from where and why did Bhatt have the bitcoins.
 
 CID crime officials questioned former BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya’s nephew, Sanjay Kotadiya. “Kotaidya is based in Mumbai. Kotadiya said he was in Ahmedabad to care for his ailing mother on the day the incident and hence denied having any role in the case,” said a CID crime official.
