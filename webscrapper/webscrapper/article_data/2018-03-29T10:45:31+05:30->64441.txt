MUMBAI: Long wait of rail commuters to board a train from   to Goregaon will soon end as the train service will be inaugurated on Thusrday.

 Chief Minister   and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal will inaugurate the Andheri to   at a special function to be held at Goregaon station. 
 
 Regular services are, however, expected to start from next week.
  
  
 According to Western Railways' Chief Public Relations Officer Ravinder Bhakar, they will also inaugurate 49 other passenger amenities such as lifts at Borivali and Dadar; escalators at CSMT, Dockyard Road, Thane and Lonavala stations; a new elevated booking office at Andheri; Foot Over Bridges at Chunabbati; a newly extended Foot Over Bridge at Virar; as well as additional services on Neral-Matheran section. 
 
 A senior CR official said, "A total of 42 Harbour Line services will be operated between CSMT and Goregaon. However, seven services will operate between Churchgate and Goregaon on the WR corridor."
 
  (MRVC), the implementing agency of the project, had hoped to commission the services up to Goregaon by June 2014. 
 
 It was later revised to December 2017, but this date too changed as some structures had to be cleared to lay the tracks near Goregaon. Once the line is extended, WR plans to extend some of its Churchgate-Andheri services till Goregaon. 
 
 A total of 65 services currently operate between Churchgate and Andheri. More Goregaon services mean commuters from Jogeshwari, Ram Mandir and even Malad will benefit. If a significant number of commuters from Malad-Goregaon shift to Goregaon locals, it will spell relief for Borivali and Kandivli commuters. The Railways may even extend the Panvel-Andheri service up to Goregaon later, said an official.
