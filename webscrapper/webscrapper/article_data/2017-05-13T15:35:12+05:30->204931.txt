Ranchi: The Rajkiyakrit Madhya Vidyalaya (government middle school) at Jaganathpur has set an example by being the first in the state to set up a solar unit. Until now, the students had to study without computers and smart classes and even basic amenities like fans and lights in the want of power supply. 

 Set up at a cost of Rs 2.25 lakh, the 2 KW solar unit was funded by a non-governmental organisation, Round Table India. 
 
 The solar unit, set up at a cost of Rs 2.25 lakh, was inaugurated by the state art, culture and tourism minister Amar Kumar Bauri. Present on the occasion was national president of Round Table India Manpreet Singh Raja. 
 
 School principal Girja Shankar Pandey said during summers it was difficult to take classes due to prolonged power cuts. “Our students were unable to concentrate on their studies as they often had to do study without fans and lights. Power supply is extremely erratic here. However, with the solar panels, the problem is sorted now. We can now hope to start smart classes.” 
 
 This school has over 1,200 students and 27 teachers. “The school has moved a step ahead by solving its electricity problem. The government is trying its best to improve the education system and unless we get support from organisations like the Round Table India, the road ahead is difficult,” state art, culture and tourism minister Amar Kumar Bauri said after the inauguration of the solar panels.
 
 Bauri added, “This school is considered to be a model school as it has all facilities at par with private cradles” 
 
 Secretary of school, education and literacy department, Aradhana Patnaik, had adopted the school. The school has introduced biometric attendance system, boundary wall, separate toilets for girls and boys, kitchen shed, and a science centre among other facilities.
