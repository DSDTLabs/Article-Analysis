AHMEDABAD: For   resident  , her dream of growing up to become a doctor one day would have been  , as her mother’s earnings plunged steeply   Urmila Chauhan, who separated from her husband, now hardly receives the quantity of stitching or salon orders as she used to receive before demonetization. Despite support from Shivangi’s maternal uncle, Urmila was unable to pay the fees for her daughter’s education. However, thanks to TOI-Times Foundation's campaign, ‘Pasti ki Masti’, Shivangi’s school fees worth Rs 1,500 have been paid.

 The third edition of the campaign, which began earlier in February, was supported by Wealth Out of Waste (WOW) agency in Ahmedabad and Vadodara. The campaign is dedicated to ensuring that girl children who dropped out of school due to financial constraints don’t give up on their education. Old newspapers donated by citizens have ensured that six more girls from underprivileged families get education.
 
 The recent demonetization impacted the livelihoods of a lot of daily wagers because labour-intensive industries struggled with cash shortage. Similar was the story of Lalit Jadav, a construction labourer who hasn’t been getting regular work after demonetization. “There are times when I have to wait for days to get some small work which is not sufficient to make ends meet. We received repeated reminders from my daughter, Jeenal’s school but we couldn’t pay her fees,” said Lalitbhai, for whose daughter, around Rs 2,160 was paid through the initiative.
 
 In fact, the initiative encouraged parents of these girls to not hamper their education. “My business hasn’t been doing as well and due to this, we were struggling with expenses. However, my wife and I were determined that both my daughters should get educated and make a living of their own,” said Ajij Ahmed, a fruit seller in Juhapura. “Lack of education did impact our lifestyle, but we won’t let it affect them,” said Ahmed, whose daughter’s education was supported by the campaign.
