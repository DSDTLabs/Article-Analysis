PATNA: It will be a give and take between  's JD (U) and Congress in Punjab polls. JD (U) wants its candidates to be given ticket by Congress if the party wants Nitish to campaign for it in Punjab. State Congress chief Capt Amarinder Singh had extended invitation to Nitish to campaign during his visit to Bihar for Prakashotsava.

 JD(U) general secretary   said Nitish has very good personal relation with Punjab CM   and his Delhi counterpart  , whose AAP is also in the fray. “It was only Amarinder Singh who invited Nitish. JD (U) has a good support base in Punjab. However, the party may think of an alliance with Congress in the northern state only if it agrees to give tickets to its candidates,“ Tyagi said. He did not specify the number of candidates they want Congress to accommodate.
 
 Asked what will be the stand of JD(U) in case Congress does agree, Tyagi said, “We will have to rethink our future strategy .Our party leadership will take a final call.“ On whether JD (U) will jump into the fray alone, Tyagi said Nitish will decide that.
 
 Sources in JD (U) said the party would not hesitate in contesting Punjab polls alone. “The Sikh community has seen the good governance model of Nitish Kumar,“ said a senior leader.
