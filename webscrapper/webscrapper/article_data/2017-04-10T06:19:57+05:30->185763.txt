AHMEDABAD: City police have initiated a ‘confidential inquiry’ to find out who wrote the   that appeared overnight on the walls in different parts of western Ahmedabad. Sources in the police said the cops had identified a few suspects who are believed to be members of a particular organization.

  The graffiti had appeared last week. Since then the city police have been keeping close watch on developments with regard to the law and order situation.
 
 “We have gathered   from the areas where the graffiti had appeared. We have ordered a confidential watch for mischievous elements. We have got some clues and are going to nab the mischief-makers soon,” a senior police official said.
 
 Senior police officials said the issue of   graffiti had come up in the crime conference held on Saturday. “Prior to that city police officials were given verbal orders to track the mischievous elements who could spoil the law and order situation when the state is heading for elections later this year” added a senior police official.
