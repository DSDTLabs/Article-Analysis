Ludhiana: Congress on Wednesday expelled 27 leaders contesting MC election as independents against the party’s official candidates.

 Gurpreet Gogi, district president of Congress, said, “Our party has already declared that no indiscipline or anti-party activity will be tolerated at any cost. We gave a warning to the workers who had filed nominations after being denied tickets. But as the move failed to deter them from contesting against our official candidates, we expelled 28 of our leaders from the party for going against the party’s decision.”
 
 Gogi said, “We have also sent a report to the high command in this regard and now there is no way that the expelled workers will be taken back into the party.”
 
 Congress leaders who have been expelled included Baljinder Singh, Ruchi Vishal Gulati, Monica Malhotra, Gurpreet Kaur Sidhu, Sushma Puri, Hardeep Singh Mundiya, Lakhveer Singh Khalsa, Ram Chandar, Mehtab Singh Bunty, Amrtipal Singh Kalsi, Sukhdev Singh Shera, Mandeep Kaur, Jasdeep Singh Jassal, Davinder Handa, Jasdeep Singh Kauke, PD Yadav, Parminder Singh Pappu, Asha Rana, Nareena Miglani,Nek Chand and Ashwani Aggarwal.
