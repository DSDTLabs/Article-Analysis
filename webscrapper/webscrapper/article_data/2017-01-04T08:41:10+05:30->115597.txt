GANDHINAGAR: Shankersinh Vaghela, leader of opposition(LOP) in the state assembly and senior Congress leader said that Prime Minister   and breached their trust and must resign.

 Vaghela said, “PM Modi has completed 1,000 days with the NDA government and made advertisements at the cost of people only for his own propaganda. Like what he did in Gujarat as CM for 13 years, he only made false promises and did no work for public welfare. PM asked for 50 days for demonetization during his Goa address, and had said that if he failed the public could punish him personally on the streets. He promised big dreams in these 50 days. Now, on completion of the 50 days, he is busy lecturing the people and the people are still suffering. For the PM, from the November 8, 2016 black money address to the December 31, 2016 address “No deadline, only headlines.” In the name of ‘Achhe Din’ prices have increased. PM must resign for of the difficulties faced by the people of India and his back stabbing of them.”
 
 “Some 110 people have died because of demonetization, chaos and irregularities prevailed everywhere and the people have suffered a lot. So many small and marginal businesses are closing down. A lot of people have lost their jobs. Due to cash shortages, factories are being locked down. Small people in the unorganized sector are going through difficult times due to unemployment and with the growth rate falling. Business has fallen to 40% for small businesses. Industries like ceramics, textiles, diamonds, brass parts, engineering, etc, have slowed down and many units are closed due to losses suffered by them in demonetization. The PM has cheated the people and breached their trust and he must resign,” he added.
