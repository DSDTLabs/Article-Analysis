Vijayawada: Crime Investigation Department (CID) sleuths arrested Avva Sitarama Rao, brother of   chairman Avva Venkatarama Rao, in New Delhi on Monday night.

 Sitarama Rao is believed to be the mastermind behind the scam. He was on the run ever since the crime came to light. The CID had been looking for him for the past four years. The premier investigation agency of the state failed to trace him even though he filed number of petitions in High Court. He went off the radar after his anticipatory bail petitions were rejected.
 
 Sitarama Rao’s arrest is a crucial development in light of the two protest programmes planned by AgriGold Depositors and Agents Welfare Association on May 30 and May 31. The victims’ association is planning to conduct ‘Nyaya Porata Deeksha’ on May 30 and ‘Athma Ghosha’ yatra from Guntur to secretariat in Velagapudi on May 31.
 
 In a recent review meeting on the AgriGold issue, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu flayed the CID officials for failing to arrest the key accused. He even ordered that the photos of the accused be published in all media platforms.
 
 Following the CM’s directives, CID sent five teams in search of Avva Sitaramarao. On Monday, the CID team headed by additional SP Trimurtulu traced the whereabouts of Sitarama Rao to Vipula Green Apartments in Sector-48 of Gurgaon. Later Sitarama Rao was produced before a local court after medical examination. Sitarama Rao was brought to Vijayawada on Tuesday evening.
 
 The AgriGold victims’ association honorary president Muppalla Nageswara Rao said it was Sitarama Rao who foiled the efforts of Essel Group to buy AgriGold properties. “Sitaramarao devised the scam and executed it by diverting the properties of the companies into the name of his family members as benami holders. He holds key information,” he said. Rao demanded the government announce a road map before May 30 to repay the depositors with less than Rs 20,000 deposit.
