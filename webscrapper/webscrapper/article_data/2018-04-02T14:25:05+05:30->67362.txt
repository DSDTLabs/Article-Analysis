Singer   said his relationship with   is "everything" he ever wanted and dreamed of.

  
  
 According to a report, Smith said the fact they are both dealing with fame has helped their relationship because of the understanding they share.
 
 "I am having a really beautiful time right now. I am in a really happy headspace and learning so much. It's everything I've ever wanted or dreamed of. Just like any relationship, it's important to have someone who understands your life. 
 
 "We are opposites but also similar in many ways and it is nice to have someone who understands - especially with the travelling. I have a house in   and am all over the place. It's great, we are young and it's good to travel," Smith said. 
 
 The 25-year-old star said he never felt any "guilt or shame" when he came out as gay. 
 
 "I am a spiritual person but wouldn't say I'm religious, though I went to   school. When I came out there was no guilt or shame. I was always proud of who I was and strong-minded when it came to my sexuality. 
 
 "Thanks to my family, I was able to come out at a young age, in a comfortable space. I was aware of the school I was in and their views on homosexuality. And it was very obvious I was gay - in all religions, there are positive and not so positive things."
