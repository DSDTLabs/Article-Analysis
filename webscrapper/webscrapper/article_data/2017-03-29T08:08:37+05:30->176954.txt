NEW DELHI: In a setback to the Modi government, Interpol has rejected a long-pending request from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for issuing a red corner notice (RCN) against fallen cricket czar  , who is believed to be in the United Kingdom since 2010. 

 “The red corner notice is meant to trace the fugitive who has been absconding and wanted in India in multiple cases. However, the grounds on which Interpol has rejected the RCN request are contradictory to the general practice,” a top ED source said.
 
 Interpol is understood to have communicated that India needs to file for extradition before moving for a red corner notice (RCN), the source said, questioning the application of law. 
 
 Lalit Modi has been facing multiple cases in India in connection with alleged irregularities in the IPL tournament and is wanted by different investigating agencies, including ED, income tax department, CBI and Chennai Police which had first filed an FIR against him. The former IPL chairman also has a pending non-bailable arrest warrant issued against him from a special court in Mumbai, besides several notices served on him by the ED through his lawyers seeking his personal appearance before the agency’s Mumbai office. 
 
 “Our basic purpose of approaching Interpol was to locate Lalit Modi against whom we have a pending non-bailable arrest warrant,” the senior ED official said, expressing disappointment at the international body showing lenience towards a person who was on the run in a multi-million dollar scam.
