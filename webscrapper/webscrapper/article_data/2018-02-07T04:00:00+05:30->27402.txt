  MD (APAC & Middle East) Sanjay Modi said, “It is interesting to note that the production and manufacturing sector is on revival mode, a much-needed impetus in order to create more jobs and solidify the backbone of our economy. Moreover, we see a surge in the online demand in banking/financial services and insurance sector. This can be attributed to the conducive investment climate,   and increased savings in the formal financial sector.”
 
 “The job market looks positive, and hopefully, hiring should also gain traction in the next few months. However, the emphasis remains on re-skilling and up-skilling employees to be able to survive the dynamism in the jobs market and the impact of rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI),” he added.
