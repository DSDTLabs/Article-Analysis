KOLKATA: A blast at the 145-year-old metal & steel factory (MSF) in Ishapore,  , claimed two lives on Sunday. MSF is one of the factories under the   (OFB) and produces both ferrous and nonferrous products for use in military hardware. 

 The ministry of defence (MoD) refused to divulge much information regarding the blast save for the fact that it occurred on Saturday evening at a 20-tonne furnace. "Nine people suffered burn injuries due to the blast and were rushed to  , Kolkata. Two of them succumbed to their injuries on Sunday. The remaining seven are out of danger. 
 
 The deceased are Falguni Banerjee (37) of Sebagram in Palta and   of Konthadhar, Ishapore," Wg Cdr S S Birdi, the MoD spokesperson, in Kolkata said. 
 
 According to sources, the two persons killed were full-time employees of MSF. There was a large gathering when their bodies were taken for cremation to Shyamnagar on Monday evening. 
 
 A high-level probe has been ordered to find out how the blast occurred. Set up in 1872, the MSF was in decline till a few years ago when modernisation started. 
 
 "It was probably some combustible gas that set off the explosion at the furnace," a source said. "Two safety and fact-finding committees are investigating the matter. We are sorry for this loss. Compensation will be paid to the next of kin according to MoD norms. The blast took place in the electric earth furnace, where we prepare steel. I have asked both the committees to submit their report as early as possible," said Rajnesh Juhuri, general manager, MSF, Ishapore.
