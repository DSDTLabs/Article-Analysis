MYSURU: Three newborns delivered prematurely died in a span of two hours at the government-run   in Mysuru. Parents and relatives of the victims alleged doctors' negligence, but the hospital said each of the babies suffered from medical complications.The three babies ­ two boys and a girl ­ were declared dead between 8am and 10am on Thursday . The youngest was 22 hours old while the oldest was 22 days. Doctors said the former, a boy , died of umblical cord prolapse, a rare condition. The latter, also a boy , died due to an intestinal problem for which he had undergone surgery , doctors said. The third baby, a girl, who was barely a week old, had an   restriction leading to death, doctors said.

 Santhosh, father of the 22-dayold, told TOI that doctors were negligent. “I have written to the medical superintendent, seeking a probe into the death,“ he said. Santhosh, a native of Mandya, said the doctors had sent him to private labs to carry out tests. “I did all the tests and followed the treatment advised by doctors, but my baby couldn't be saved,“ he said.Parents of the other two babies also blamed doctors for the deaths.
 
 Denying the allegations, medical superintendent S Radhamani said the deaths were due to medical reasons. “There is no wrongdoing on the doctors' part. I have checked all the records and line of treatment. Everything was fine and as per standards,“ she said. The younger infants weighed 1-1.5kg while the 22-day-old weighed 2.5kg, she said. There were 23 babies in the neo-natal intensive care unit, she said, of whom the three had died due to complications.
 
 The government-run Cheluvamba hospital records the highest number of deliveries by any hospital in a day ­ about 45 ­ in the state.
