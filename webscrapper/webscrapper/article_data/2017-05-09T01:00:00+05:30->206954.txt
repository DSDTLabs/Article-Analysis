PATNA: Patna University (PU) vice-chancellor (VC) Ras Bihari Prasad Singh on Monday announced that Vanijya Mahavidyalaya would start functioning from its new campus at Saidpur from the next academic session (2018-19). The Rashtriya Uchchtar Shikhsha Abhiyan (RUSA) has already sanctioned Rs 3 crore for the campus and is likely to provide more funds for the construction of a four-storeyed building for the college.

 “The Bihar State Educational Infrastructural Development Corporation will look after the construction work,” said college principal B N Pandey. 
 
 A puja was performed on allotted land on Monday in which several MLAs and MLCs, including Arun Kumar Sinha, Nawal Kishore Yadav, Neeraj Kumar and Sanjeev Chaurasia as well as PU officials and principals of different colleges participated.
 
 Vanijya Mahavidyalaya, a constituent unit of PU, has been running from a three-storeyed building at Patna College since 1973. With more than 1,500 students on its roll, it does not have a playground or space for recreation. The new campus at Saidpur will have an academic block, administrative blocks, labs, a quarter for the principal, common rooms for boys and girls, a canteen and other facilities.
