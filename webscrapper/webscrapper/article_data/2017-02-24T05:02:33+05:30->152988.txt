AHMEDABAD: With the rising number of offences allegedly involving policemen causing a huge embarrassment to the force, the city police has started scanning a list of about 30   in different police stations and agencies who have a  .

  Top police sources said the list contains the names of some police officers and personnel of armed as well as unarmed contingents. “Most of them are vahivatdars (policemen who manage the collection of money for senior cops). We have placed them under surveillance,” said a top city police official. 
 
 “The idea is to thwart any corrupt action.” Police officials said they have also prepared a list of policemen who are absent without intimation or permission for long periods. 
 
 “Police constable  , who was arrested for kidnapping, had been absent for a long time,” the official said. “We have learnt of another police constable who has been on leave without permission for a long time. We have moved an application to dismiss him.”
 
 A top police official said that vahivatdars thrive on a system created by some senior police officials. 
 
 “And they play the critical role of conduits to officers in building the cop-criminal nexus,” the official said. In a fortnight, four policemen have been arrested for their alleged involvement in offences such as robbery, kidnapping, running a gambling den, and an illegal money-lending racket. Last week, during a raid on a gambling den, carried out by ACP Manjeeta Vanzara, an armed police constable,  , was nabbed red-handed.
 
 “Rana was partner in the gambling den with  ,” Vanzara said. “They had procured forged documents to pass off the den as a club. The den had hidden chambers in which gambling took place.”
