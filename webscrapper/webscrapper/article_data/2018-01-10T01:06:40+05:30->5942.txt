NEW DELHI: Two   of a   were   after they staged a   on the road in the bid to   the   whose owner failed to pay the  . The incident took place on December 20 in southeast Delhi’s Sunlight Colony, however, the men were arrested on Monday evening.

 DCP (southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said the accused Nitin and Deepak were charged under IPC Sections 392 (robbery) and 341 (wrongful restraint) and the hunt for two others was on. 
 
 The victim, Sandeep Singh, of Rohtak, was heading towards Noida with his younger sister in their Grand i10 car, which he had got financed in 2016 through a Noida-based firm.
 
 Singh told cops that their car was initially followed by a   Dzire that had four men who signalled him to stop near Ashram. When he pulled over, the accused had a heated exchange with him. When Singh protested, they attacked him as well. 
 
 After the ruckus, they took the car keys and drove away. Singh then called the police helpline informing that some people, who claimed to be from the finance firm, took his car forcefully. Subsequently, cops traced the car to a parking lot in Greater Noida. The local police informed cops in Delhi that the men had confiscated two more vehicles in a similar way and two cases of robbery were registered against them with Noida police as well.
 
 The accused told police that they are hired muscle men who helped the firm recover assets from people who were not paying their instalments on time. The cops said they had booked the men as they failed to follow the due procedure in recovering the car. “If the finance company’s agents spot a vehicle or a person from whom they have to recover some amount, they should first intimate the local police and approach the client with them,” a senior officer said, adding that in this case, no intimation was made, and the men behaved in a manner that can be termed unlawful.
