PATNA:   home department has approved   president Lalu Prasad’s application for pension on Wednesday, making him eligible to receive Rs.10,000 per month under the JP Senani Samman Yojana. The scheme, introduced by CM   during his first tenure to commemorate freedom fighter Jayprakash Narayan, has over 3,000 beneficiaries, including senior   member Sushil Kumar Modi.

 “Lalu’s application was found valid. The state home department will send an advice to the treasury and bank concerned for payment of pension to him,” a home department official told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 He said Lalu would be entitled for pension with retrospective effect since 2009.
 
 The RJD chief, who was a student leader when JP called for ‘Sapoorna Kranti’ (Total Revolution), was jailed in 1974 under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (Misa) at Bankipore jail. As per rules, anyone jailed for over six months under Misa or Defence of India Rules from March 18, 1974 to March 21, 1977, is entitled for a monthly pension of Rs 10,000.
