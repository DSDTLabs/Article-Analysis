When   was writing the script of  , the inspiration for the story came from his own life. A film that delves into the relationship of a father and son, along with a message on choosing the right time to love forms the crux. Elaborating about it,   says, “I come from a village called Ambalapattu, located in Orathanadu, Thanjavur district. When I was studying, there used to be a head master by the name HM Sarangan, who created a revolution of sorts in that tiny village. A school that used to have hardly 400-500 students gradually increased to 2000 students, through his way of teaching and mentoring students. And all of them have gone ahead to become medical practitioners and joined top-class engineering colleges. My story is about a character like him, played by KS Ravikumar, who creates an impact among the students through his teaching. However, he fails to have that connect with his only son, played by Nandan (music director Sirpy’s son). While he’s a favourite among students, there is some sort of a distance with the father and son. While Nandan studies well, he takes a wrong path by falling in love while in school. There is a message for the audiences, but it wouldn’t be too preachy.” 

 Actress   plays Nandan’s mother and Venba of Kadhal Kasakuthaiya fame plays his love interest. “The film was shot primarily in Thanjavur and Ambalapattu. The highlight, though, is that we shot the film in the same school I studied. I went there after 30 years and it brought back so many memories for me. Also, it was wonderful to have directed KS Ravikumar sir, whom I wanted to join as an assistant to when I started off my career in films,” says Vasu. The music is by Vijay Narayanan. “We showed the trailer and songs to Kamal Haasan sir and AR   sir. Both of them appreciated it. We are very excited about the release,” he says. Actors Ponvannan, RK Suresh, Thambi Ramaiah, Ganja Karuppu and Sujatha play crucial roles in the film.
