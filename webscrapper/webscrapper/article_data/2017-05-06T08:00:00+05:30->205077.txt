Shattered, written by journalists   and Amie Parnes has been optioned by   and Davis   for a limited TV series. Bridget Matzi, the author’s literary agent, confirmed the deal.

 Released just last month, Shattered is a New York Times Bestseller. The authors offer their opinions on Hillary’s loss, analyzing the whole election from the beginning all the way to election night. The book is met with some criticism by those working for Hillary in her campaign.
 
 Christina Reynolds, deputy communications, wrote, “It’s hard to read a depiction of the campaign that paints a dedicated, cohesive team as mercenaries with questionable motives who lacked a loyalty to a candidate described as ‘imperial’ and removed from the campaign,”, in a post on Medium.
 
 One can only anticipate how the   will project Hillary; if it’ll portray her less harshly than described is not certain. The project is brand new and the show doesn’t even have a writer yet, nor is any network attached to the project.
