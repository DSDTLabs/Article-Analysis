CHENNAI: Stand-up comics who had the audience in splits, street dancers who kept the crowd on toes and bands that made it to the final showdown - day 2 of Saarang,  ' annual cultural festival, was not short of action.

 Around 58 street dancers competed against one another showing off hip-hop styles, and popping and locking techniques, drawing cheers from the crowd that was kept entertained throughout as 16 talented B-boys went into a dance-off to make it to the final rounds. 
 
 While the B-boys drew a lot of accolades at the Student Activities Centre, upstairs another set of dancers took to the floor but in complete silence. The crowd danced but to no external music as IIT Madras' first-ever silent disco was on the way. 
 
 Jazzy lights shone across a room as a DJ played beats for the crowd wearing headphones.
 
 "With a silent disco there is no need to worry about how much noise we may make or about permissions as we could host it anywhere on the campus. The restrictions are minimal. We have about 180 headphones so we are carrying it out in batches over two days. There has been a very good response and we received 1,069 registrations online while many others came for spot registrations," said  , a student co-ordinator.
 
 The second day also brought many stand-up comics to the campus including   and   Ali. 
 
 Meanwhile, stand-up comedian   didn't spare anyone as he made the crowds crack up on a variety of topics including cricket, football, EDM as well as relationships.The day culminated with EDM Night with performances by Swedish Rapper supported by DJ Nina Suerte.
