CHENNAI: Six IAS officers, including former Tamil Nadu state election commissioner  , are facing contempt of court proceedings in the  , with the latter issuing notices to them on Friday.

 A division bench of the court issued notices to T S Rajasekhar, secretary of SEC, Hans Raj Varma, principal secretary of rural development and panchayat raj department, K Phanindra Reddy, principal secretary of municipal administration and water supply department, K Maharabushanam, director of town panchayats, and D Karthikeyan, commissioner of Chennai corporation.
 
 The notices were issued on a contempt of court petition filed by the DMK against them for their deliberate failure to comply with the February 22 order of the division bench to conduct local body elections in Tamil Nadu at a date not later than May 14.
 
 According to the petitioner, the bench had on February 22 directed the commission to ‘truthfully’ comply with a set of directions issued by a single judge on October 4, 2016, including making it mandatory for candidates to file affidavits declaring criminal antecedents of candidates and uploading them on the website.
 
 The interim order was passed on an appeal moved by the SEC assailing the order of a single judge, quashing the election notification dated September 26, 2016, citing non-compliance of Tamil Nadu Panchayat (Elections) Rules, 1995. As a consequence, the elections scheduled for October 2016 stood cancelled.
 
 Now, alleging that the SEC and other authorities responsible for conducting elections to the local bodies had wilfully failed to comply with the court order and complete the elections by May 14, the petitioner wanted the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the authorities concerned. 
 
 Since Seetharaman was the commissioner of the SEC when the division bench passed the interim order, notices had been issued to him along with other officials.
