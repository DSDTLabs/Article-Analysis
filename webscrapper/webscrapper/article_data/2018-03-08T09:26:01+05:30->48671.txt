PANAJI: With the season a week into summer and its rigours being felt more, the mercury has shown a slight rise during morning hours for about a week and the morning chill has vanished.

 The summer commenced on March 1 and the morning hours have been warm so far. The minimum temperature recorded during the last few days has been hovering around 23 degrees celsius. “The discomfort is due to more humidity in the morning,” an official from India meteorological department (IMD),  , said.
 
 While these are the usual signs of summer, the maximum temperature which had soared to 35 to 36 degrees Celsius in the last week of February had not caused much discomfort. The day temperature recorded during the last few days has been hovering around 32 degrees celsius. The difference in temperature recorded within a week is four degrees. “But, the humidity has increased now and it makes the heat sultry,” the official said.
 
 The minimum and maximum temperatures have been well within the normal range in the first week, but increase in humidity makes the difference. 
 
 The humidity is more than 90% in the morning and 70% in the night hours. IMD, Panaji, has forecast a minimum temperature of 23.0 degrees celsius and a maximum of 33 degrees celsius for the next couple of days.
