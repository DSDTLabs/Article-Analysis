AHMEDABAD: Since September 2017, the UGC has been receiving complaints about the inclusion on the “UGC-Approved List” of poor-quality, questionable journals from faculty members, researchers and others in academia from across the country. 

 On May 2, the UGC’s standing committee on notification of journals, after a detailed re-evaluation of every journal title recommended by universities and indexed by Indian citation index, removed 4,305 journals from its present “UGC - Approved List”, of which 17 are Gujarat-based journals.
 
 These journals include, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Lokgurjari, a journal by   and   Sahitya Academy, Gandhinagar, Journal of the Gujarat Research Society, VNSGU International Journal of Science and Technology, Towards Excellence: A Journal of Higher Education by UGC Academic Staff College in Gujarat University. Then there is   of Multidisciplinary and KCG Journal of Education belonging to the Gujarat government, ‘Vyayam Setu’ brought out by Swarnim Gujarat Sports University, ‘Parab’ brought out by Dr Usha Upadhyay Gujarati Sahitya Parisad, Shabd Srushti, by Gujarat Sahitya Akademi, Journal of Law and Governance of Nirma University, Journal of Energy and Management by PDP University, eJournal of Social Science by KCG and IJRCS Research Culture Society and Publication.
 
 The UGC has a rider, that these journals may be considered for re-inclusion once they fulfil some basic criteria. The standing committee has cited non-availability of information such as details of the editorial board, indexing information, year of journal’s commencement, frequency and regularity of its publication schedule to be some of the reasons for removal.
