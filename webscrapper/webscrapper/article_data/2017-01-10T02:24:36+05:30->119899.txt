NEW DELHI:   on Monday sought the intervention of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to summon the file pertaining to the final draft order on   of wards and approve it at the earliest so that   polls can be held in April. 

 Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken said if the delimitation order was not approved immediately, the party will approach the court. He also alleged that the AAP government is stalling the process to delay polls. AAP has denied the allegations saying it is ready for polls and had sent the file to the   about 10 days ago. 
 
 Vijender Gupta, leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly, had also raised doubts over the intentions of the ruling dispensation alleging that they were delaying the process of notification when he met the LG last week. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari had also blamed the government for the delay. 
 
 “It appears that after being unable to deliver governance in Delhi, the ruling party is reluctant to face the people in the forthcoming municipal elections and wants to intentionally delay the polls. This is a serious violation of various provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act 1957 and the Constitution,” Maken said in his letter to Baijal. 
 
 An AAP spokesperson denied the allegations saying that urban development minister Satyendar Jain had sent the file to State Election Commission (SEC) about ten days ago pointing out certain discrepancies in the ward demarcation in the final order. “Now, the matter rests with SEC and LG’s office. It is up to the poll panel to take into account the points raised by us. We are ready for municipal polls anytime,” the spokesperson said.
