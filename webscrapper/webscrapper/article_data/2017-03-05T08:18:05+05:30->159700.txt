RANCHI: Jharkhand   are now working on a futuristic 2035 document to improve   in the  , DGP DK Pandey said on Saturday.

 In the first phase of the plans, police authorities have decided to seek 22 acres of land each, in several districts across the state, to set up police camps and coordination centres for integrated development of Maoist-hit areas. 
 
 Pandey said, “By 2035, we hope to ensure a safe Jharkhand. We are working on a roadmap and requirements to achieve this objective will be detailed in the document.”
 
 The DGP also convened a meeting with top officials of the state and districts to charter the future course of action. Apart from long-term plans, authorities also discussed the immediate priority areas for 2017-18.
 
 To ensure a Maoist-free state is the top priority of the department. To achieve this, a cohesive approach of ensuring security coupled with fast-paced development under various government schemes has been adopted by the state government. The other two focus areas are corruption-free police and effective crime control. 
 
 “Police forces will ensure the safety and the other concerned departments of the state government will push development projects aggressively. Development of remote places, especially those infested with Maoists, is our prime focus.”
 
 A total of 13 trouble-spots across the state have been identified for the anti-Maoist project. Officials hope to “cleanse” these hotspots and make them ready for swift and effective implementation of development projects. 
 
 The 13-point development-intervention project focuses on integrated development of places like border areas of Jamshedpur, Bokaro and Dumka-Godda, apart from Parasnath, Banalat, Khunti-Chaibasa- Seraikella, Giridih-Koderma border, and Saranda, Saryu in Latehar district.
 
 The project will be supervised by chief secretary  , who along with Pandey, recently visited two remote, development-starved blocks of the state.
