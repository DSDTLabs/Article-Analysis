Mumbai: While the   has retained the Amravati graduates seat, the outcome of the elections to the teachers’ and graduates’ legislative council constituencies is being viewed as a setback for the BJP.

Patil polled 78,051 votes, Khodke, who was backed by the  , got 34,154. Although Patil had begun preparations for the elections a year ago, there was uncertainty over his election in view of a campaign launched against him by some social workers.
 
 In the Konkan teachers’ constituency, the BJP experienced a setback after its nominee, Venunath Kadu, lost to PWP’s Baliram Patil, who was supported by the Congress-NCP combine. 
 
 In the Nashik graduates’ constituency, Congress nominee Satyajeet Tambe-Patil retained the seat with a large margin. Tambe-Patil defeated Prashant Patil, son-in-law of Union minister of state for defence Subhash Bhamre. Tambe-Patil secured 81,576 votes against 39,593 polled by Prashant Patil. Since Prashant Patil was related to Bhamre, it was a prestigious election for the BJP. The saffron party had launched a high-powered campaign against Tambe-Patil, but it did not succeed. BJP made all out efforts to defeat Vikram Kale (NCP) from the Aurangabad teachers’ constituency. But Kale defeated BJP-backed candidate Satish Patki by a margin of over 10,000.
