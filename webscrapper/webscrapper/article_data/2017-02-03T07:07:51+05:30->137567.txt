AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday once again took the government authorities and the investigators to task in connection with the incident of blinding of four patients after botched cataract surgeries at the   last year.

 Justice J B Pardiwala raised questions with regard to the probe and sought to know how the investigators intend to inquire into the role of the doctors in the botched up surgeries. The judge also questioned the investigators how could they prosecute the manufacturers of Savlon liquid antiseptic after the government laboratory has given a clean chit to them by certifying that the liquid was up to the standard set by the government itself.
 
 The court has posted further hearing on February 7.
 
 In this case, the manufacturers of Savlon liquid antiseptic have approached the high court after they were booked in this case. This happened after three government hospitals and colleges affiliated with them â€“ the LG Hospital, NHL Medical College and   found fault with the liquid. However, the Government Food & Drugs Laboratory did not find any problem with the liquid and certified that it was conforming to the standards set by the government for the medicine.
 
 The main grievance expressed by the court was that the same product has been used by the private hospitals also, from where there is no complaint in this regard.
