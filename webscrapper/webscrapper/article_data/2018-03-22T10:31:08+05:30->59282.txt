HYDERABAD: The   proposed by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao may be inching towards becoming a reality what with DMK leader MK Stalin on Wednesday criticising the Centre on states being deprived of funds. Stalin wrote a strong letter to all non-BJP chief ministers, including KCR, criticising the fiscal policy of the Centre which was alleged to be detrimental to the interests of many states.

 Stalin’s strong resentment against the Centre was an echo of what KCR had been complaining about. Stalin had also written letters to West Bengal chief minister  , whom KCR had met recently, in connection with the formation of a Federal Front. Others who were sent the letter include Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal, Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik, Tamil Nadu’s E Palaniswamy, Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan, Puducherry’s V Narayanaswamy and Punjab’s Amarinder Singh. Interestingly, Stalin did not include   CM Chandrababu Naidu in his mailing list.
 
 “Progressive states, should in fact, be given incentives. After all, the growth of a state is growth of the country,” KCR said on Wednesday. With Stalin expressing his views openly, the way has got clearer for KCR to approach chief ministers of other states to take forward his Federal Front idea.
