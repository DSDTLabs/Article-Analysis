CHENNAI: A team of horticulturists and a group of residents have successfully transplanted a 200-plus-year-old   uprooted by   on December 12 at Ayanambakkam near Ambattur. The process began on Saturday and ended on Monday night.

 Horticulturist and landscape expert  , who was part of the operation, told TOI that residents of the area had approached him to take up the transplantation work. He visited the spot last week and agreed to help in the work.
 
 On Saturday, the residents used a bulldozer to push the tree, and this damaged a few portions. The second day , branches were pruned, fungicide applied on the branches and rooting enzymes applied on the roots. On the third day, the tree was transplanted in a 6foot-deep pit. 
 
 A 40-tonne crane was used to lift the tree. Will the tree survive the transplant operation? Ilango said his team had successfully transplanted banyan trees in a few places and they survived.
 
 Water has to be sprayed on the branches for the next 45 days. After that, the roots need to be watered. Once that is done, the tree will get back its life, he said.
