 was punked by her fiance   once again. 

  
  
 The 25-year-old   shared a selfie video with the actor on   Story over the weekend, in which she can be seen riding shotgun with him as they grooved to 21 Savage's 2017 single, 'Bank Account'. 
 
 As Cyrus was concentrating on having a good time while looking into the camera, Hemsworth, 28, pranked her by yelling, 'Oh sh*t' faking to lose the car's control. 
 
 The 'Malibu' hitmaker captioned the video: 'I fu**ing hate when he does this sh*t.'
 
 Hemsworth had also pulled a similar prank on Cyrus in 2016. 
 
 After breaking up in 2012, the couple reconciled two years ago.
