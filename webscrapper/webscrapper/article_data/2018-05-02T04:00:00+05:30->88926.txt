Palanpur: Following the complaints that saline water was being used on construction work, villagers halted the building of a school in Nalodar village of Banaskantha’s Vav taluka on Tuesday. 

 They said cement and concrete can adhere with saline water water and the construction could be dangerous in the future.
 
  “As water from Narmada canal is not available, the contractor was using the saline underground water that he got by digging 20 feet deep,” said Laxmansinh Darbar, brother of village sarpanch. 
 
 “This village with a population of about 2500 in border taluka Vav has been battling severe drinking water crisis. While women stand in long queues to get water, some strong-headed elements are illegal drawing water by pilfering from pipelines,” said Darbar.
 
 “Construction work of this model school is going on for the last one month but we came to about the use of saline water few days ago. After our protest, the work was postponed for about 20 days and the contractor assured us that he wont be using such water,” said Darbar. 
 
  “The model schools are raised in every taluka under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shala Abhiyan.(RMSA) and Nanodar was selected in Vav for a model school,” said,” Deepak Darji, district education officer (primary schools).
