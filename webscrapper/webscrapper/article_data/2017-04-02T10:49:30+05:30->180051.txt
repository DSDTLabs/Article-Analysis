PATIALA: Paying tributes to Akali stalwart   at   in Bahadurgarh, SAD president   said the Congress government should fulfil its poll promises of farm loan waiver and giving jobs and smartphones, instead of making excuses that finances were coming in the way of development.

 SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar and Anandpur Sahab MP Prem Singh Chandumajra also spoke about Tohra's contribution to society and Sikh community.
 
 However, at the main event in Tohra village, the foster daughter of the late Akali leader, Kuldeep Kaur, said this was the first time that SAD leaders did not attend the main event. 
 
 “When Akalis organized the function during their 10 years of rule, leaders of Congress and other parties used to be here. Everybody had respected Tohra sahib because of his dedication to the Sikh community,” she said.
