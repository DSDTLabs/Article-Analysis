  : The wreckage of a plane, believed to be of an   from  , has been discovered on a remote hill near Bogi Nodi, around 226 km from here. Verification by experts is needed to ascertain details about the plane. 

 A team of youths from   district's Kimin circle, led by Taba  , Nangram Kaha and Dukhum Jitu, headed towards the spot. 
 
 Nobin said the journey to the spot of the wreckage took three days because of the rough terrain involved. "Villagers told us that they discovered some ruins which appeared to be of a plane's. We managed to unearth a few chunks of metal scraps that appear to be remains of the engine, radiator and other parts of a plane," Nobin said.
 
 Though the team did not have the equipment necessary to identify the plane, they paved the way for further research, marking the area with the help of GPS devices and taking photographs of the area. "As we were not prepared for the findings, lack of proper machineries and equipment restrained us from lugging back the metal parts. We tried to collect as much data as we could, but it requires proper verification by experts. We are ready to support the research if there is any interested person," added Nobin.
