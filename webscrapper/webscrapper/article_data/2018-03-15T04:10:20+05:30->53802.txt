Ghaziabad: The district administration has identified two plots where it could dump its civic waste. There are plans to develop waste-to-energy plants at these two sites — Galand and   — and the administration, GDA and GMC are preparing a DPR.

 “We’ve identified 35 acres of land in Galand and another 21 acres in Mohammadpur Amad Baghpat in Modinagar which will be developed as landfill site,” said C P  , municipal commissioner. “The two patches of land identified would not only serve as landfill sites but waste dumped here will be used in generating power. The agencies have hired a private firm to prepare the DPR.”
 
 Singh further said that Mohammadpur Amad Baghpat will serve as a landfill for civic waste generated from areas such as Muradnagar, Modinagar and Mohan Nagar while the Galand site will cater to solid waste generated in the areas under GDA’s control and four zones under GMC, including Pratap Vihar, Kavinagar, city and Vasundhara zones.
 
 The city generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste daily. In the absence of a designated landfill site, all the waste is dumped in Pratap Vihar landfill, in the heart of the city. As the site is close to the Hindon, the waste sometimes spill over and enters the river. 
 
 Environmentalists have over time raised the issue with the authorities saying the mound of waste near the river is contaminating the groundwater. 
 
 About a decade ago, when GMC began dumping civic waste at Pratap Vihar landfill site it was opposed by the residents tooth and nail and at that time it was said that it is a temporary arrangement. Authorities effort to find a suitable land for dumping waste proved to be futile as no private owners were ready to part away with the land. But with these two parcel of land in Galand and Mohammadpur Amad Baghpat, authorities hope that they will not face any problem and the plant will see the light of the day.
