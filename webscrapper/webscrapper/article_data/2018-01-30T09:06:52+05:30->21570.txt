SURAT: A   met   (DEO) U N Rathod and  , donations and   with him here on Monday. The parents were told an inquiry will be done in a school if only they had any   about it.

 The issues raised by them were about quality of teaching, non-qualified teachers, not using NCERT books after class VIII, non-transparency in fees collection, donation, admission fees and security deposits, security and transport. The parents also complained that the schools were not displaying income expenditure details on notice board and ran two sections affiliated to GSHSEB and CBSE from the same campus.
 
 The parents were told by the DEO that their concerns will be addressed. “On the issue of donation, we can take action only if the parents can produce some evidence. The group of parents was making allegations and we cannot take action simply like that. I asked them to be specific. They then named a couple of schools and we will now conduct inquiry into their complaints,” Rathod said.
 
 “Several representations have been made to the DEO by groups of parents in the past few days. However we only get assurance of action. No action has been taken by the department in any issue other than fees,” a parent said.
 
 “Schools don’t have qualified teachers but the education department is not doing anything in this regard,” another parent said.
