THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has issued an order permitting   people who underwent   to change name and gender in   and decided to introduce transgender as the third option for gender in  .

 Officials of   took the decision based on a petition filed by transgender persons requesting to change their name and gender. “We received petitions with medical certificates to prove that they have changed sex through surgery and the government must allow them to mention as transgender person in SSLC book,” said an official of Pariksha Bhavan. The order has stated that only transgender persons who underwent sex reassignment surgery can change their names and gender.
 
 
 However, the transgender community is not happy about the new order. Transgender activist Sreemayi said that education department had committed a blunder. “As per the 2014 judgment of National Legal Service Authority, it is illegal to insist sex reassignment surgery as a condition for changing one’s gender. The gender must be self-declaration,” said Sreemayi, adding that the order was against transgender policy.
 
 Transgender activists said that they would contact TG cell to make necessary changes in the order.
 
 However, Pariksha Bhavan officials said that they need some proof such a medical certificate to make changes in the gender and so they mentioned about sex reassignment surgery. Education minister C Raveendranath was not available for comments.
