Vadodara: In a bizarre accident, a pedestrian in Pavi Jetpur town died after a sack was fell on him from a truck on Tuesday morning. The act got recorded in a CCTV camera of a nearby shop. But, what is more bizarre is that the local police have booked the driver of the truck for rash driving which led to the death. According to CCTV camera footages, a labourer throws one bag from the truck which was parked near the bus stand there. When he dropped the second sack, Jaga Rathwa (65) happened to walk past the truck and the sack fall on his head. Rathwa had gone to the bus stand to see off his son and daughter-in-law who were going to Dhrangdhra for work. When the sack fell on his head, the shopkeepers nearby ran to his rescue, but he was already dead. The police was informed about the incident. While the police could have registered a case of accidental death or book the labourer for negligence, they booked the truck driver for rash driving and his negligence. The complaint which was registered at Pavi Jetpur police station stated that the sack fell on Rathwa’s head because the unidentified truck driver suddenly applied brakes. “We have registered the case as per the details we have received from the spot. We have not checked the CCTV camera footages yet. If need be we will examine them during the course of investigation,” said R G Barot, police sub-inspector, Pavi Jetpur police station.
