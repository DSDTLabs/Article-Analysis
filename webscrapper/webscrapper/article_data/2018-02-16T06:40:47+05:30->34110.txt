KOLKATA: The next time you are sitting beside an auto driver and making a call on your mobile phone, be careful.   has launched a campaign where it wants all auto drivers to actively dissuade passengers sitting at the front from making such calls. The police said they would also introduce a Rs 100 fine on the violators. The cops have already launched the campaign near Tollygunge.

 “We have been strict about not letting any rider or driver talk on their mobile phones. But we found that passengers who speak loudly on phone are amajor cause of distraction for auto drivers,” said Sumit Kumar, DC (Traffic).
 
 Police sources said that they will be using CCTV footages to identify violators. “We will be speaking to the auto unions to ensure the project is successful. The auto drivers should be active participants,” said an officer. Cops said that this would be over and above the earlier police decision to implement a Rs 1000 fine by compounding the relevant Motor Vehicles Act for commercial vehicle drivers. “It will be a carrot and stick policy just like bus drivers — those who will ensure that passengers sitting on the front seat avoid making calls will be rewarded. Those violating the same will have to bear consequences,” explained another IPS officer.
 
  
 According to   that carried a survey in Kolkata and seven other cities in 2017, use of feature phones is high among transport drivers and auto rickshaw drivers with 8 out 10 bus/truck drivers and 6 out of 10 autorickshaw drivers using feature phones.
 
 Meanwhile, police — along with private bus operators and government bus drivers’ union — have begun an antimobile sensitization programme at bus depots like Esplanade and Ultadanga. “We are telling drivers that the   accident should come as an eye-opener. There should also be an understanding about the dangers of driving while talking on the phone,” said a private bus owner from the   route.
