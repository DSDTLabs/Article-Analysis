ALLAHABAD: From April 30, Allahabad   would become the first museum in the country to become self-reliant in power through solar photovoltaic (SPV) technology. The renewable mode of energy would help save upto Rs 2 lakh monthly, which the museum pays to   (UPPCL) as electricity bills. 

 The museum consumes 68kW to 98kW of electricity per month through conventional power grid, depending upon the season. After installation of the solar power panels, it would start producing 100 kW per month, saving at least 42 to 2kW in the peak season.
 
 In the first week of January, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed with   (SECI), under the ministry of new and renewable energy, for installation of solar panels. As many as 220 solar panels are being set up at the rooftop of the museum. 
 
 The museum is expecting to bring down power consumption to 40kW by changing all the bulbs to LED.
 
 Allahabad Museum director   told TOI that the museum will generate over 100% of its electricity requirements through the renewable mode of energy. 
 
 Currently, the museum is paying over Rs 1.5 lakh per month as electricity bills. It is being charged Rs 7.40 per unit but after installation of the solar panels, the electricity will be charged at the rate of Rs 5.40 per unit.
