VADODARA: Even as it has witnessed a significant growth in its milk procurement, annual turnover of Mehsana-based Dudhsagar Dairy – one of the four largest milk unions of Gujarat - has dipped by over 5%

 The figures shared by the milk union shows a quantum jump in its milk procurement compared to last year. Against 88.98 crore kg milk that the dairy had procured in the fiscal year 2016-17, it got 99.12 crore kg milk in financial year 2017-18 that ended on March 31. This is 11.40 % more compared to the last fiscal. 
 
 But the dairy union’s turnover of Rs 4,500 crore in 2016-17 has declined to Rs 4,271 crore in 2017-18. 
 
  officials also said that they are struggling with unsold stocks of finished products worth Rs 983.55 crore, which is 84.86 % higher compared to the stocks worth Rs 532.05 crore which it had in the last fiscal. 
 
 Mehsana Dairy’s managing director Nishit Baxi has directly blamed the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) for the decline in its turnover. The milk union is at loggerheads with the federation for the last couple of years. 
 
 “GCMMF has reduced sales of our milk and other dairy products because of which we have a unsold stock of nearly Rs 1,000 crore and our annual turnover has also declined,” Baxi said in a statement. 
 
 The dairy officials said that although it was the first union of Gujarat to start its operations to cater to the Delhi and   (NCR) market, GCMMF has reduced sales of milk and other dairy products processed by it. 
 
 “Against Rs 1,660 crore worth sales that we had clocked in 2016-17 in Delhi market including that of products like milk, dahi, ice-cream, buttermilk and UHT, our sales have decreased to Rs 1,485 crore in 2017-18 as federation is giving us step motherly treatment,” said the official. 
 
 GCMMF officials however refuted all the allegations and instead blamed the mismanagement of the union for the decline in turnover. 
 
 “Against the allocation of six lakh litres per day (LLPD) milk which it was supposed to do from   and Haryana, they (Mehsana Union) procured 12 LLPD,” said GCMMF’s managing director R S Sodhi. 
 
 “At a time when there was 20 % rise in milk procurement in Gujarat, there was no need to buy more milk from outside Gujarat. Our commitment is towards the farmers of Gujarat. We had been repeatedly urging them, almost on daily basis to stop increasing their inventory as they are already under heavy debt. But they did not follow discipline,” said Sodhi. 
 
 Sodhi said that commodity sales have declined due to depressed market conditions in the global and local market. 
 
 GCMMF itself has witnessed a 60 % decline in its commodity sales as prices of skimmed milk powder (SMP) which was earlier sold at Rs 225 per kg is being sold in the range of Rs 140 per kg to Rs 150 per kg. 
 
 Sodhi said that while Amul federation unlike other state federations is not adhering to desperate sales, Mehsana Union itself had issued direct tenders which further crashed the prices. 
 
 “We are still selling SMP of Mehsana Union in the range of Rs 180 per kg to Rs 190 per kg which is much higher compared to the prices at which federations in Southern parts of the country are selling,” he said.
