Pregnancy hasn’t affected actress   as only a few months after delivering a baby, the   is back on   with ' '. Even with the  , the new mommy, we hear, travels with her son daily to the set. And her   kids, too, are bonding quite well with her son Rudranssh.
Mitaali told us, “It’s hard for me to leave my baby in a day care since he is still very small. I get to spend some time with him on the set and my on-screen kids also love having him around. On Sundays, my husband takes care of him since it’s his day off. I prefer leaving my baby with a family member rather than a nanny. I feel that a nanny can never provide the love and care that a family member would. My maasi, who looked after me when I was a child, also accompanies me to take care of Rudranssh. On the sets, my production team is extremely supportive. They let me spend time with him and they jump in when I’m shooting for a scene, and calm him down if he is crying.”
