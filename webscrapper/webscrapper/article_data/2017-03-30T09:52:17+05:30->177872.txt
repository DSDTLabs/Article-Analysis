NAGPUR: : Irked with unemployed husband’s constant torture, a 35-year-old woman,   at Central Bank of India, committed suicide by   from the ceiling fan at her residence in   on Wednesday morning.

 Her husband Ashutosh Hawre (35) who broke open the door and saw her dead. He informed the neighbours, who alerted the cops. 
 
 “I was not at home when Vrushali ended her life. When I came back, I found the door was locked from inside,” said Ashutosh.  , who sent the body to GMCH for post mortem, have registered a case of accidental death. Police said no suicide note was recovered from the spot. 
 
 Sources close to the family said that Vrushali and Ashutosh, a chemical engineer, got married three years ago. Matters turned sour when his parents forced him to leave a Mumbai-based job as a lecturer and shift to the city in 2015. But he remained unemployed and started demanding money from Vrushali.
 
 However, he used to get annoyed by her suggestions, the relatives claimed.
