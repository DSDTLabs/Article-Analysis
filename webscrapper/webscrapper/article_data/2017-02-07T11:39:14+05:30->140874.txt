   is currently busy shooting for  ' next movie. The actor, who has been on the top of his game lately, even went on to sign director  's next project that was due to roll out this month. However, his film is now facing unexpected delays.
  
  
 
  
  According to reports, the AR Murugadoss film was supposed to wrap up by January end and Koratala’s film was slated to go on floors from February. However, the cop action flick that is underway will not be completed before March, which means that the Mahesh-Koratala Siva project will begin only in April. Apparently, this long delay is worrying the ‘Srimanthudu’ director, who planned to release his film for Dussehra this year. But now, as his film has been thrown off track for two months, he will have to race against time in order to complete it before the festive holiday.
  
  Meanwhile the AR Murugadoss flick is expected to release sometime in April.
