Gurgaon: A road security drive has spotted more   on city roads. The accident-prone spots were identified by road safety associates in Sohna and Ambedkar Chowk during a drive as part of the Haryana Vision Zero, an initiative to bring down the number of accidents in the state.

 Situated on National Highway-919, which connects Rewari and Palwal in Haryana, Lakhuwas also faces a lot of high speed traffic, which leads to accidents. Similarly, Ambedkar Chowk is located near the intersection of the Palwal-Rewari and Delhi-Jaipur highways. Dr Rakesh Gupta, additional chief secretary, Haryana, said both black spots require junction improvement, changes in road engineering and removal of encroachments. Also, all unauthorised cuts and U-turns on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway and Gurgaon-Alwar highway will be closed. 
 
 Gurgaon, meanwhile, will soon have an automated fitness testing centre for vehicles. Such centres will be launched in Ambala, Faridabad, Fatehabad, Karnal and Mahendragarh, and each centre will cater to three-four neighbouring districts.
 
  The first one has already been launched in Rohtak. The new system is expected to bring in transparency in the system, said Vinay Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner Gurgaon.
