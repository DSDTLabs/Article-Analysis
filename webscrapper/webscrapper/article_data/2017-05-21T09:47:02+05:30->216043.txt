HYDERABAD: With Sunrisers Hyderabad being knocked out of the Indian Premier League ( ), the cricket fever in the city is now tepid. 

 Though the final will be played in mana city, cricket enthusiasts say they have no reason to cheer as their team won't figure in the match. The final will be played between Mumbai Indians and Rising Pune Supergiants.
 
 "This IPL was especially good for Hyderabad Sunrisers, who emerged as one of the top four teams. This is the reason why so many in the city expected the team to reach the finals," said  , a cricket enthusiast.
 
 Hyderabad Sunrisers crashing out of IPL 2017 has come also as a rude shock to pubs and sports bars in the city, who were expecting "roaring business" during the final showdown. Even smaller bars were expecting to attract customers on the final day with their affordable packages on food and liquor. 
 
 "Although we have not rolled out any special offers for the cricket season, like many other pubs have, we screen the match live. 
 
 "We have noticed that the pub witnessed maximum footfall on days when Hyderabad played a match. So, were were expecting this footfall to grow during the final match, as is the case with most tournaments. With the Sunrisers out of the race now, we do not expect to see a large crowd during the screening of the final MATCH on Sunday," said  , manager of TAG- The   in Jubilee Hills.
 
 While the cricket fever among fans has waned in several parts of the city, in the IT hub, where a large migrant population lives, hopes are still running high.
 
 "Although it would not be akin to watching the finals in Pune, where there would be larger number of people supporting the home team, I have decided to head out to a sports bar in   to watch the match along with colleagues," said Harsh Kale, an IT professional and supporter of Rising Pune Supergiants.
