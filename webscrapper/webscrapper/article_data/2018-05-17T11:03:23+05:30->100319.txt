BHOPAL:   is not just about collecting feedback from citizens and verification of general cleanliness in a city. As   has shown (once again), it is also about playing to the optics and achieving benchmarks.

If watching the first citizen of the state capital was not enough,   chief minister   participated in a cleanliness drive, barely days ahead of the ‘Swachh Survekshan’ earlier this year.
 
 
  
 
 “The achievement was not possible without the hard work and support of Bhopal citizens,” said Bhopal mayor Sharma. Bhopal being ranked second in 2017 Swachh survey left many astonished.
 
 Municipal corporation has wisely spent crores in sustaining the ‘rank’.
 
 It ranges from construction of toilets; meeting open defecation free (ODF) parameters to painting nearly every city wall with messages in support of  .
 
 “Swachh Bharat Mission gave impetus to focus on cleanliness and hygiene,” said   additional commissioner MP Singh. The laurels of Bhopal being ranked India’s second cleanest city once again did not come easy for the civic body employees.

 There were occasions when Sharma turned up at 5.30 am, ahead of the municipal corporation staffers. It kept the staff on their toes.
