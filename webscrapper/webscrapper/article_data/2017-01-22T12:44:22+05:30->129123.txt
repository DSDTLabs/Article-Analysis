DEHRADUN: Congress state chief   took to Twitter on Saturday to deny rumours that he had quit the party over ticket distribution. The rumour mill in the state is abuzz since differences between Upadhyay and CM   are believed to be behind the delay in Congress’s list of candidates for assembly polls.
 
  The reports doing rounds on social media stated that Upadhyay had left the party owing to differences over ticket distribution. On Saturday, Upadhyay tweeted, “Vested interest from   spreading my offer to resign. I am a loyal soldier of @INCIndia Jai Uttarakhand.”
  
  Talking to TOI, the Congress state chief said that there were no differences with the CM and such rumours were being spread by a few people to benefit the BJP. “Congress has the upper hand in Uttarakhand and is doing well under my leadership. We are confident of retaining the seats. The coordination between Rawat and me has become a thorn in the flesh for the BJP,” added Upadhyay.
  
  According to Upadhyay, names of party candidates for all 70 assembly seats have been finalized.
