  state treasurer S R Sekar addressed the media announcing the foot march. He said, “The campaign will be conducted between March 10 and 14. We will start from either   or   and conclude at Mettupalayam.”
 
 A decision on conducting the campaign was taken few days ago in the party’s executive committee meeting, said BJP state general secretary Vanathi Srinivasan. “We discussed the matter and came to a consensus that the state government has been ignorant about the maintenance of water bodies and dams in this region. Only when there is struggle for water with a neighbouring state, the state government diverts its attention towards these dams,” Vanathi told TOI.
 
 Vanathi, who is also the in-charge for party’s activities in Coimbatore parliamentary constituency, said that five party leaders from the state will participate during the campaign. Union minister of state for road transport and highways, Pon Radhakrishnan, senior BJP leader H Raja, party state president Tamilisai Soundararajan, former MP from Coimbatore C P   and senior BJP leader La Ganesan will take part.
 
 Youth will also be roped in to take part in the campaign. “We will call them green volunteers. Next week we will initiate a reach activity through social networking sites,” said Vanathi. “We aim at getting 10 lakh signatures from the public demanding to clean the dams and water bodies. A copy of the same will be submitted to the chief minister,” she added.
