PUNE: The Kondhwa police on Friday registered an offence against a suspended police constable for raping a 28-year-old make-up artist for the past nine years. The constable had also recorded an obscene clip of the woman and uploaded it on a pornography website with the help of an accomplice.

 The police have also registered a case against the accomplice who uploaded the clip and the woman’s husband, who had filed a false complaint against her after being instigated to do so by the constable.
 
 All three have been booked under sections 376 (rape), 363 (kidnapping) and 384 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code, relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act and Prevention of Atrocities Act.
 
 A Kondhwa police officer said the woman and the constable knew each other. In her complaint, she said that in 2009, the constable had taken her to his friend’s room in   and raped her after mixing sedatives in a soft drink. “He had recorded an obscene video of the woman, following which he repeatedly raped her by threatening to upload the clip on the web,” the officer said.
 
 The woman also alleged that the constable had abducted her and extorted money from her. He had physically assaulted her too. “The woman said the constable had forwarded the clip to her husband and given false information to him and her relatives,” the officer said.
 
 Following this, the woman’s husband had registered a complaint against her and her parents with the   police. “The woman was shocked to know that the clip was already uploaded on a porn website,” the officer said.
 
 The complainant recently approached police commissioner  , who issued orders for registering the offence. Assistant commissioner of police (Wanowrie division)   is probing the case.
