KOLKATA: The gunshot death of the kin of an Independent candidate in the troubled zone of Bhangar on Friday, barely 24 hours after the Calcutta high court compensation- for violence writ on officials, prompted a damage-control exercise led by Chief Minister   herself.

 
 Hafijul Molla, kin of one of the Independents who have mounted a surprising challenge to   in Bhangar, was shot in the head by TMC supporters and died on the way to a nearby health centre.
 
 Banerjee, in an interview to a Bengali TV news channel a couple of hours after the incident, mentioned Trinamool's most prominent face in Bhangar -   - by name. "I came to know Arabul Islam did something in Bhangar. I have asked police to arrest the culprits," she said.
 
 The rest of the state administration, too, scurried to maximise forces. In one district, Purulia, it meant calling back even home guards and constables deployed as personal security for ministers, district and sessions judges, political leaders and industrialists. Even civic volunteers have been trained to aid cops.
 
 
 
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee alleged on Friday that there is a threat to her life and police is enquiring into it. She even said that the suspects had done a recee at her Kalighat home and a supari (contract) has been paid for it. While stressing she doesn't fear for her life, the CM also indicated she has already handpicked successors to fill in her absence in the party and the administration. In an interview to a private TV channel, she said, "I have been repeatedly told by police to change my home. I do not fear death. I have been targeted several times. I have never disclosed this either to my party or to my family either." Saying that she doesn't let such information bother her, Mamata said she has already planned for any eventuality.
