PUNE: Data from the income tax department revealed there are more accounts with over Rs1 crore deposits in some cooperative banks than in the bigger state-run banks. 

 According to data available with the tax department, Pimpri-based Seva  , with 25 branches, has 36 accounts with deposits of over Rs1 crore since demonetisation. Ulhasnagar-based   has 221 such accounts, while Satara District Cooperative Bank has 20 such accounts and   has 5.
 
 These include current as well as savings bank accounts. In comparison, Bank of Maharashtra, with over 1,800 branches, has reported just 12 accounts with total deposit of over Rs1 crore since demonetisation.
 
 There is, however, no system-wide data yet on over Rs1 crore deposits across all banks in the country. When data comes to light, the tax department sends notices after basic scrutiny. This does not mean that all deposits of over Rs1 crore are illegal but the department will question such account holders. “If they are not able to explain the source, then there is trouble,” a tax official said.
 
 Banks must send details of high deposits to the finance ministry’s financial intelligence unit (FIU). Seva Vikas   (SVCB) said all their deposits were within norms and were reported to FIU. “In normal banking, business depositors deposit big amounts sometimes even more than Rs1 crore. Whatever specified bank notes (SBNs) we have received from our depositors are as per RBI instructions. Wherever there are big deposits of SBNs, our bank has reported as a matter of course on a daily basis to FIU,” chief executive officer of SVCB, T N Lakhani, said. 
 
 Navjeevan Cooperative Bank’s chairman was unavailable for comment, while Konark Cooperative bank officials could not be reached.
 
 “Each account holder will have to explain the source,” a tax official said.
