Panaji: With 1.3 billion connected devices and   (IoT) devices expected to populate homes in India by 2021, home networks can become easy targets for cyber criminals, said global cyber security agency Fortinet.

 Personal, financial and medical information, as well as work assets are all at risk from increasingly sophisticated malware and financially-motivated cybercriminals, Fortinet said in a report.
 
 “Faster and more affordable internet connections are driving more home users in India to deploy internet-connected devices at home. Recent IoT-based attacks have revealed the sheer volume and ease by which billions of connected devices can be weaponized and used to disrupt the digital economies of entire countries and millions of users. These issues are compounded by the lack of basic security features and management capabilities in many IoT devices,” said Fortinet regional vice-president for India and SAARC Rajesh Maurya.
 
 Connected devices on the home network range from smart TVs, entertainment and gaming systems, smart refrigerators, to online home security systems. All of these devices are connected to the internet through a home WiFi system.
 
 In order to secure home networks, Fortinet recommends that users identify devices that connect to the Internet through the WiFi network and to restrict and monitor the traffic generated by the devices.
 
 “Home networks and devices tend to become infected because security is notoriously lax. Set up a separate connection for work, only connect through a VPN tunnel, and consider encrypting sensitive data travelling back and forth between home and corporate networks,” Maurya suggests.
 
 According to a NASSCOM report, India will account for 5% of the global IoT market valued at 15 billion USD by 2020. Experts predict an average of 4.3 internet-connected devices for every man, woman and child on this planet by 2020.
