CHENNAI:   will hold demonstrations across   on January 20 to protest against the Centre’s new education policy, which the party says has a religious bias, and the introduction of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test ( ) for medical admissions.

 In a statement released on Monday, DMK working president M K   said, “The Centre wants to introduce Sanskrit in schools. The new education policy has a religious bias." 
 
 Stalin said students were given admissions in engineering and medical colleges based on Class 12 marks. "Introduction of NEET and the new education policy will affect rural students,” he said.
 
 He asked all party workers to join the demonstrations and make them a victory. 
 
 In a separate statement, Stalin thanked party members and leaders of all parties for having wished him on assuming charge as the DMK working president.
 
 "The number of party members and leaders wishing me shows that there is more responsibility for me. Tamil Nadu's growth is low in many areas. As of now people have started looking at our party and they want us to take the state forward. I will use your wishes as a fertiliser and work for the party. I will ensure the people's wishes will come true soon," said Stalin.
