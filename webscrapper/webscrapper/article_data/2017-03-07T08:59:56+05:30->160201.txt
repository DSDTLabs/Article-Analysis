BHADOHI: In the Muslim-dominated villages of  , there’s one wall that symbolises communal amity. Not only the  , even the   in these villages want a boundary wall around ‘kabristan’. In fact, in many of the villages, the wall was built even before the state government thought of it. For this wall, they say, has helped resolve everyday conflicts. 

 “Everytime they (Muslims) brought a body for burial, an argument would start as they would try burying the body beyond the burial ground,” said Lalchand Misra in Lachhapur gram sabha in Bhadouli. To end the conflict, then pradhan of the village, Nirmala Gupta, got the fencing around the ‘kabristan’ in the village using the gram panchayat fund. Rutahan has more than half the population of Muslims. Villagers pooled in money to get the boundary wall built around the burial ground. “While the government builds walls for the sake of making them, ours is at least five feet high,” said Rutahan villager Indramani Tripathi. 
 
 “We have Brahmins and OBCs farming in our villagers and the move has helped them the most. Earlier, they often complained of encroachment by Muslims who came to bury bodies in kabristan. The argument often took an ugly turn. Now their fields will not be encroached upon, “ said Jaddupur pradhan Mohd Muslim. In this village, wall construction has been approved and fund sanctioned. In Bardahan, another Muslim-majority village, the wall was built seven months ago.
 
 In some villages, encroachers didn’t spare even the kabristan land. “A portion of kabristan’s land has been encroached by OBCs and they do farming there. Now, at least the walled area will be protected,” said Islamuddin. In some villages, the area of kabristan has shrunk over the years. “We have been demanding more land for it. It’s after about three years that another body can be buried at the same spot as a earlier burial,” said Munawwar Ali. A wall has also been constructed in villages like Chauri and Anekpur.
