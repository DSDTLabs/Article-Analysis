Fortunately, it has a strategic advantage in terms of long coastline which can serve as a backbone for trade. Right strategy would be to create economic epicentres around modern ports with world class infrastructure."

This research aims to highlight key opportunities and challenges in the ports sector. It also attempts to showcase the vast opportunity present in the ports sector, especially on the east coast."
