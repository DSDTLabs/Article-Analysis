NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has sought the response of   on a plea by a practising lawyer challenging the university’s greater weightage to academic qualifications to appoint assistant professors to teach law.

 A division bench of the high court asked the university to respond after the lawyer approached it in appeal against a single judge ruling in favour of  . “The appellant has challenged awarding of points at the time of shortlisting for interview for teaching or research experience and not for experience as a practising lawyer/associate in a law firm as arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution,” the plea said.
 
 It added that if DU’s present criteria to award marks to candidates seeking to be inducted as professors is accepted, it would mean that a candidate having “teaching experience even at a primary level at any school will have an undue advantage over a candidate who carries huge professional and practical knowledge but does not have teaching experience. The candidate who doesn’t have teaching experience...would be considered a fresher... and screened out of 80, which is unreasonable.”
