HYDERABAD: Soon, the city will get its first set of 40 electric buses to ferry passengers to the Rajiv Gandhi International   (RGIA) in Shamshabad. This was announced by the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) on Saturday. Officials said the buses will hit the streets in the next four months.

 
 Sharing more details about this new fleet of ‘green’ vehicles, M  , executive director of TSRTC, said: “As these buses are fitted with electric motors that run on battery, they will not pollute the environment like other regular vehicles.” Also, they will not be expensive, officials assured.
 
 
  
 
 “The same AC   fares will apply to those travelling by the electric buses too. Nobody will be charged any additional fare,” said G V Ramana Rao, managing director of TSRTC. This fleet, he said, will replace the existing fleet of AC buses that cater to passengers travelling to RGIA.
 
 The project has already been awarded to a private agency and work on it is on in full swing, officials said.
 
 Speaking about the specifications of these vehicles, they said the cost of each of these 12-meter-long low floor AC bus that’s been manufactured by BYD (a Chinese company), is pegged at ?2.4 crore. Each have a seating capacity of 40.
 
 “The bus will be operated by the private agency for 12 years and the TSRTC will pay the agency ?33 per kilometre. Maintenance, appointment of driver and fuel will the responsibility of the agency, but the conductor will be a TSRTC employee,” said Rao.
 
 According to sources, another 60 electric buses will be pressed into service in the second phase of the project, keeping with the Government of India’s (GOI) appeal to all state governments to use more such vehicles in order to tackle pollution.
