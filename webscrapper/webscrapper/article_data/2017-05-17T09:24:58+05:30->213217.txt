AURANGABAD: The   of   (BJP) on Tuesday demanded the   (MPSC) should conduct its mains exam for the post of sales   in Aurangabad as well.

 In a representation made to Sunil Autade, MPSC deputy secretary, activists Chandrakant Hivarale and Prashant Sathe said the commission has regretted that it has declared the mains examination to be held on June 3 in Mumbai only.
 
 “This decision has posed difficulties before the candidates. It would put financial burden as well as cause tremendous inconvenience to the candidates from different parts of the state specially those who stay away from Mumbai,” they said.
 
 Speaking to reporters they said thousands of candidates from far off places would have travel all the way to Mumbai.
 
  “Earlier these main exams were being conducted at four places — Aurangabad, Nagpur, Pune and Mumbai,” the duo said.
 
 “The preliminary exams for the 181 posts were conducted smoothly on January 29 at 32 centres. If the MPSC doesn’t change its decision, candidates from across the state would have to travel at least 500 to 1000 km to reach Mumbai, where they would find it difficult to get accommodation apart from locating the exam centres. Hence, the MPSC should conduct the mains exam at other places like it used to do in the past,” they added.
