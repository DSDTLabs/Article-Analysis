JAIPUR: Relying on the social welfare schemes to counter anti-incumbency, BJP’s law and legal cell has launched a book titled ‘Jankalyankari Yojnaya’ (Developmental Schemes), a compilation of Central and state government schemes.

 Launched by chief minister   on the BJP’s Foundation Day on Friday, the book has detailed information about 88 social welfare schemes.
 
 Penned by   of BJP’s law and legal cell, the 300-page book has been sent across all BJP offices to further spread it among the masses. “It is a first-of-its-kind compilation of government schemes solely intended to help the beneficiaries. It provides a detailed overview of every scheme and has mentioned eligibility criteria to promote clarity among the people. I have also attached application form of every scheme in the book so that people can have an idea of documents required and how to fill the application form,” said Somani.
 
 BJP has asked its party functionaries to distribute the books among the party workers which would help them spread it among the voters. “Party has introduced several welfare schemes which require promotion and publicity. The book will inform the masses about the schemes introduced by BJP government in the Centre and state,” said Somani. As elections are scheduled later this year, BJP is desperate to disseminate information about the schemes it has launched since it came to power.
