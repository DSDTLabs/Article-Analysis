PATNA: Three   (ART) centres in Bihar will carry out   for HIV/AIDS from April 19. It is under the ‘Viral load testing for all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)’ initiative launched by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on February 26 this year.

 The   selected in Bihar are at   (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) Patna and Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur.
 
 Total 530 ART centres have been selected for free viral load testing of 12 lakh PLHIV on treatment in the country at least once a year.
 
 The central government has tied up with a private laboratory in Mumbai under public-private partnership (PPP) mode to provide viral load testing facility to patients across the country. A senior state health department official said samples would be collected from the three ART centres and flown to the Mumbai laboratory for test. “A hard copy of the report will be sent to the state,” he said.
 
 Human immunodeficiency virus ( ) targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. Viral load testing essentially tells whether the ART treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of virus in a patient’s blood.
 
 “In more than 95% cases, the viral load becomes undetectable after six months of ART treatment. Earlier, the only test conducted to measure the effectiveness of treatment was to check the immune level (CD4 test) in a patient. Sometimes, the patient also becomes drug-resistant after treatment and thus the viral load increases. With viral load testing in government ART centres, it will be possible to detect the increase of the viruses in the blood of the patient after treatment,” a member of International AIDS Society, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, said.
 
 There are only three private labs in Patna for collecting samples for viral load testing and they charge approximately Rs4000- 4500 for one test.
