KOLKATA: One of the main accused in the baby trafficking racket being probed by the CID has expressed her desire to turn approver. Sources in CID said  , who ran a nursing home in North 24 Parganas has decided to confess before a magistrate. Though top CID officers involved in the probe refused to come on record, they confirmed that a final decision on the same will be taken soon.

 Bibi, who was at the epicentre of the multi-crore baby trafficking racket, is in   in North 24-Parganas, but the shockwaves were felt in Kolkata. The CID had claimed three nursing homes in the city had direct links with the gang.
 
 CID officers said Najma was a ground worker and is aware of the entire structure that was put in place by the gang to operate smoothly . She was also one of the kingpins who actually fine-tuned the modus operandi of the gang.CID officers said that her statement will help highlight the role of the “bigger players.“
 
 The CID and   ce have now been able to trace at least four babies that had gone “missing“ from private nursing homes across the state and later trafficked with the intention of profit. Sources insist they now have crucial evidence in two separate cases that can help them ensure conviction against nearly 27 gang members arrested in these cases.
 
 “We have recorded some statements which will prove to be irrefutable in court,“ said a senior CID official.
 
 A top   official said the police stations will from now on keep a detailed list of the adopting parents and their children.
