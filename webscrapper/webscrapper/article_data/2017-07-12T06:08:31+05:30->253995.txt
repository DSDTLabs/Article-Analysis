CHENNAI: The Greater Chennai Corporation could begin the physical transformation process of   under the   project as early as next month, according to officials.

 T Nagar, which was selected in 2015 under the area based development programme of the central government-sponsored Smart Cities Mission, will undergo a slew of infrastructural changes as the civic body rolls out the over Rs 1,400 crore project phase-by-phase.
 
 First among those to take off would be the smart roads project, which covers 23 interior roads in the area including the Maharajapuram Santhanam Salai and Muthurangan Salai.
 
 At Rs 15 crore, these roads will receive a makeover that includes Wi Fi connectivity, rain water harvesting pits that would collect run off water and recharge the ground water table, smart lamp posts, wide footpaths, parking areas and a walkway fitted with anti-skid tiles. Projects like re-developing eight T Nagar parks at a cost of Rs 10 crore, replacing sodium vapour lamps with LED lights at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore are the others.
 
 "Tenders for these projects have been called for and a few bidders have already expressed interest. If things flow by design, then we can expect to start work on the projects by end of August," said a corporation official.
 
 Other major smart city projects like the construction of multi-level car parking lot and the pedestrian plaza could follow suit, officails said. "The detailed project report on the multi-level car parking is yet to be finalised. It could be ready by next month," said an official.
 
 The city corporation has lagged behind in the execution of the smart city project. Despite being picked in the first batch of 20 smart cities in January 2016, Chennai is the only city yet to register   development.
