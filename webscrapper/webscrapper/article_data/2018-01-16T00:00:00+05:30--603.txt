It was two days of fun, excitement and energetic   as students of Jain University — Centre for Management Studies played host for colleges across the country as they held their annual CMS Festival Lasya 2018. Students from 15 colleges across the country participated in over 40 events spanning over two days as they put their best foot forward and showed off their talents in various events like beat boxing, singing, dancing, ramp walk, collage making, face painting, acting and more. Even the faculty members of the   were seen having a gala time as some of them walked the ramp along with the students and showed off their fun side. Highlights of the   were live performances by standup comedian Abish Mathew on Day 1 and When Chai Met Toast on Day 2. Actress Sana Saeed of Student of the Year fame was also seen judging the Indian Group Dance event on Day 2.

 
 
 We caught up with Abish after his performance and the standup comedian was all praise for college fests. “I think the best place to perform for anyone, whatever art form it is — whether you’re a musician, a comedian or anything — is at college fests. One of the reasons is that the students’ committee that organizes such fests knows that whoever they are inviting to perform at the event is the best for that platform. There’s something about the energy that you see at colleges. It’s insane energy.”
 
 But over the years have college fests changed in some way, we ask? “There’s something evergreen about colleges that doesn’t change. The energy of a college will never become sad or depressing. It’ll always be a happy energy and that’s what I have seen since I first performed at a college. What has changed a bit is the audiences. They wait for conversation to happen outside the comfort zone. There are things that they can’t say but want someone to say it,” Abish sums up.
