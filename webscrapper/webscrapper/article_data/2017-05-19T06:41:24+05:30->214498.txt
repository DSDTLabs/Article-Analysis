NAGPUR: Consumers’ delight after   rates were reduced by over Rs2 a litre on Monday was short-lived. The state has now increased the surcharge on Value Added Tax (VAT) levied on petrol. 

 Petrol rates, from Rs74.38 a litre, has gone up to Rs76.39. There is no change in the price of diesel which will continue to cost Rs60.92.
 
 The earlier reduction was on account of revision by the oil companies which is based on the rates of crude oil. Prior to Monday’s reduction, petrol prices were at Rs77.12 a litre. The surcharge leaves the current rates of petrol less by just 73 paise as against a difference of Rs2.74 earlier.
