INDORE: A spurt in gold demand in the wedding season may see spot   touching a new high in coming weeks, dealers said. 

 The prices are ruling near to its new high of Rs 31,500 per 10 gram made last week, according to jewellers from Sarafa. “Gold prices are moving vertical because demand is encouraging and sales have been very good since beginning of April,”   secretary Avinash Shastri said.
 
 Four gold jewellers from Sarafa said, gold prices may jump further from the current levels making a new high because demand is robust due to the wedding season. 
 
 They said, looking at the sales, gold prices may   by another Rs 200 per 10 gram in a week or two. As on April 8,   was Rs 31,400 per 10 gram.
 
 Indore Sarafa Association president Hukumchand Soni said, “Sales have gone up in April and the trend is likely to continue in coming weeks.”
 
 Sarafa houses about 1,500 shops while the Sarafa Association has about 800 members.
 
 Wedding season will continue until late June and demand of gold is likely to remain high because gold is considered an auspicious gift. 
 
 According to jewellers, demand from rural consumers is encouraging this season due to better earning from Kharif crops.
 
 Shastri said, “Buyers from villages are the main customers these days. Unlike urban customers, they buy heavy weight traditional items.”
 
 Local Sarafa traders mostly get ornaments from the wholesale jewellers of Mumbai, Surat and Ahmedabad. 
 
 A few traders though expect the buying spree to calm down at these levels because prices have increased a lot. 
 
 A jeweller from Sarafa said, “This is not an investor driven market as prices are very high. I believe at this stage, buying should come down because prices have made a new high and people prefer to buy when gold prices fall below Rs 30,000 per 10 gram.”
