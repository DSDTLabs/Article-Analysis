TRICHY: Citing the impending judgement in the disproportionate assets case against Sasikala, DMK working president   wondered aloud if   would become the chief minister for the fourth term, here on Monday. 

 “The judgement in the disproportionate assets case is likely to be out in a week’s time. Whenever Jayalalithaa lost her post, Panneerselvam took the reins. This time around, it is not clear whether Panneerselvam would get a chance to become chief minister for the fourth time, as there is some speculation that Natarajan, who is undergoing treatment in hospital, may get the post,” Stalin said. He was speaking to reporters before leaving for Chennai, after attending the marriage function of K N Ramajayam’s daughter on Monday. Ramajayam is the younger brother of DMK Trichy district secretary KN Nehru. 
 
 Former Union minister  , who also attended the wedding, said that Stalin would be the best leader to run the state after M Karunanidhi. “Karunandhi has the capacity to run the party and the government in Tamil Nadu. Stalin would be the next eligible leader in line,” said Dayanidhi Maran.
