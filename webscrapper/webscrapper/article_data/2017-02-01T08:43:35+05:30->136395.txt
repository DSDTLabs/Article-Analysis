PUNE: The Pune rural police team investigating the murder of 23-year-old software engineer   have identified two women who were near the spot when she was stabbed to death in   on December 23, last year.

 Both eyewitnesses are software engineers working in a company in Talawade IT park. They did not come forward earlier as they were terrified after witnessing the brutal murder, the police said. 
 
 “We have to record the statements of the two women. We hope to get some vital information about the assailant from them,”  , inspector of the local crime branch of the Pune rural police, said on Tuesday.
 
 Jadhav said they spoke to autorickshaw drivers, fruit vendors and paan stall owners near the murder spot. “During the probe, we got information about these two women. They were near the spot when Antara was murdered. If they can give us any bit of information about the assailant like a description or his language, we can trace him,” he added.
 
 Attempts to unlock Antara’s cellphone are on. “While taking Antara to the hospital, people tried to unlock her cellphone to enable them to contact her relatives, but the instrument got locked permanently. We are not able to check the text messages she sent. These messages would certainly prove helpful,” Jadhav said. 
 
 The cellphone is now with experts. “We expect to get it unlocked soon,” he added. They have checked her call records before she was murdered but found nothing suspicious, Jadhav said.
 
 Police are probing the murder from several angles, including the involvement of Bengaluru-based software engineer  . A fresh investigation has been ordered. 
 
 “On the night of the murder Santosh Kumar was in Bengaluru. We have checked his cellphone records and   footage. However, we cannot rule out his involvement in the murder as he used to harass Antara,” Jadhav said.
