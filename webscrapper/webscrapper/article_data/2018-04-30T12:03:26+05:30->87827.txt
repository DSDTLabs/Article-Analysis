THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   (TDF) affiliated to the INTUC registered a strong protest on Sunday alleging that   MD   has been treating the employees in a humiliating way. 

 KPCC general secretary and TDF president   demanded Thachankary to withdraw his statement against the staff, who have been working dedicatedly, even without salary and allowances.
 
 "Thachankary has been trying to introduce reforms without studying the problems faced by the employees. His statement that 30% employees were unfit for job was baseless. Both the government and the KSRTC MD have been trying to implement the report submitted  , which has been dubbed impractical. The government should keep the promise it made while signing an agreement with a consortium of banks that the salary and pension will be paid on time,"   said.
 
 Meanwhile, Thachankary has declared that the salary and pension dues will be paid on Monday. For the past several months, the KSRTC had been distributing monthly salary in the first week of next month.
 
 "An amount of Rs 86 crore has been allocated to pay the salary for 45,000 employees for April. Rs 60 crore has been arranged from cooperative banks to pay pension," said Thachankary. Thachankary denied the allegation that he had humiliated the employees. 
 
 "I always try my best to expose the present state of the corporation and to boost the staff morale to improve its condition. Unfortunately, my speech has been misinterpreted" said Thachankary.
