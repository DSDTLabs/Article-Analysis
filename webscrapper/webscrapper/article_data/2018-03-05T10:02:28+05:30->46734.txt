NAGPUR: Assistant police inspector Atul Tawade and assistant sub inspector Rajesh Chawar were seriously injured after an Improvised Electronic Device (IED) went off during dismantling efforts at   in Maoist-affexted Gadchiroli near Korchi on Monday. Both were shifted to Nagpur for treatment in a chopper.
 
 Sources from Gadchiroli said Tawade and Chawar were riddled with splinters after a pressure bomb kept wrapped in a red banner went off at 5.30am on Monday. The banner, put up to appeal masses to join hands for a strong resistance against government on International Women's Day on March 8, was strategically placed near the roadside on the main Korchi-Kurkehda Road.

 Gadchiroli DIG Ankush Shinde said the cops had gone to dismantle the banner after receiving a tip-off. "We are now trying to analyse the situation and strategy which the outlawed organisation might have adopted," he said. 
 
 In an earlier incident at Etapalli tehsili, C-60 jawan Gonju Mattami was injured following an attack on him by the Maoist action team. The jawan had gone to a weekly market near   where he was suddenly surrounded by red guerillas in civil attire who fled after stabbing him.
