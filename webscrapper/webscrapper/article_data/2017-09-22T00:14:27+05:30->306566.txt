MUMBAI: A common   for all modes of   will soon become a reality, chief minister Devendra   said at an event organised to lower tunnel boring machines in the underground shaft at Naya Nagar in Mahim, as part of the   III (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) underground corridor.

 Fadnavis said all Metro corridors, once completed by 2020-21, will be able to carry 90 lakh commuters a day. 
 
 He said a non-binding MoU was signed with Ford Mobility Services to develop the ticketing system, which will provide a huge boost to public transport, as it can be used across all modes of public transport.
 
 Work on elevated corridors (CSMT-Panvel and Churchgate-Virar) on the suburban system will also be expedited, and will carry another 40 lakh commuters, he said. Apart from Metro III, work on Metro VII (Dahisar-Andheri via Western Express Highway) and Metro II (Dahisar-DN Nagar via Link Road) is in full swing; both projects are likely to be completed by 2019.
 
 Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority said work on five more corridors will begin by December 2017.
