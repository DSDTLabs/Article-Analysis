HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) swung into action on Monday and pasted red notices on the premises of defaulters, who have not paid their dues for several months. The water board sent a number of warnings to defaulters saying their water connections would be disconnected if they did not pay the dues. For the first time, the water board has pasted the notices outside the homes of all the defaulters. A team of water board officials, led by general manager of O&M Division-XIV S Kiran Kumar, visited the defaulters' homes in Kapra, Moula-Ali, Raghavendra Colony , Chilakanagar and Habsiguda in the city and pasted the notices on the compound walls and pillars of the buildings of whose whose bills were overdue. “As many as 12 defaulters cleared their dues after we pasted the red notices on their walls,“ Kiran Kumar told TOI. He said the name-andshame campaign had resulted in the defaulters paying dues amounting to Rs 1.35 lakh immediately after the move. As per the records, there are 4,000 defaulters who owe the city water board close to Rs 2 crore in dues. The range of each defaulter's arrears is between Rs 7,000 and Rs10 lakh. As per the instructions of HMWS&SB managing director M Dana Kishore, the notices will also be pasted on the premises of defaulting government offices.
