PATNA: Danapur rail division’s senior divisional commercial manager (DCM)   and senior travelling ticket examiner (TTE) Abhishek Anand were on Friday night booked for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman clerk.

 The FIR was lodged in the city’s women police station. According to police, the alleged incident took place on March 20 at   where the widowed clerk is posted. “She approached police with a written complaint on March 21, but the FIR was lodged only after our preliminary investigation found the accusation prima facie true,” a police officer said.
 
 Quoting the FIR, the officer said   had came to inspect the woman’s counter. She told him to either come with senior officials or security persons. In the evening, she called on   to complain against the TTE.
 
 “Vinit allegedly told her that she had already been transferred and unless she paid Rs 20,000 to stop her transfer, he won’t help her,” the officer said, adding some junior officials told police during preliminary investigation that the victim was spotted crying when she was leaving the DCM’s chamber on March 20 evening.
 
 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said investigations were on and City SP (central) D Amarkesh was supervising the case.
 
 Meanwhile, ECR’s chief public relations officer   said the clerk was suspended after she was found possessing Rs 2,500 during a surprise check by an anti-fraud squad on March 21. 
 
 “Several senior officials, including women, were witness to the surprise check during which the clerk was frisked by women RPF personnel,”   said and added the clerk never approached senior officials regarding her complaint against the senior DCM.
