LUCKNOW: For Harleen, who thought of gifting her mother a new set of clothes for Baisakhi, finally finding an ATM that was dispensing   was a miracle. This was the 11th ATM which she had checked and one which did not have its shutter down or displayed a ‘No Cash’ sign. 

 Sadly, Harleen is not alone as many in the   were left with empty pockets on Wednesday, because of the problem of empty or non-fuctional  . 
 
 Bank officials said as   were closed on Tuesday on account of Hazrat Ali’s birthday they were unable to refurbish ATM machines with cash. This is the second time in the past week when people have been cash-strapped due to empty ATMs.
 
 Though the situation remains the same with both private and public banks, it might be easier to find a functional private bank ATM. Most kiosks of public banks are either closed because of a technical glitch or are out of order. For Gomtinagar resident Sapna Khann, her family’s dinner plans for Tuesday turned into an ATM hunt when they needed cash. “We were out for a family dinner on Tuesday. We looked around at least seven to eight public bank ATMs between Gomtinagar and Hazratganj, but not even one was operative. Finally, we had to withdraw cash from a private bank ATM,” she said. 
 
 “Not even a single ATM around Civil Hospital has cash and I have checked every possible machine. How am I supposed to buy medicines for my father who is suffering from diarrhoea?”, said Adarsh.
 
 As people lined up outside ATMs for their chance to withdraw some money, many still had to return empty-handed.
