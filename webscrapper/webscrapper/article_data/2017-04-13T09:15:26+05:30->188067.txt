NEW DELHI: The five-year plan, a relic of Nehru-era economic policy, will officially be buried as the Niti Aayog’s governing council is likely to approve the government’s new policy document: the three-year action plan (2017-2020).

 The government had announced that it would 
  from the current fiscal, after the 12th Plan ended on March 31, 2017, and replace it with 
  and 15-year vision document. It will also come out with a seven-year strategy paper.
 
 The BJP dispensation’s first key policy document related to planning needs the nod of Niti Aayog’s high-powered governing council headed by PM Narendra   and has all CMs, administrators of Union territories and senior Cabinet ministers as members.
 
 A top government source said Modi is likely to call the meeting of the governing council on April 23. “The meeting’s agenda is approval of the three-year action plan,” he added. The government’s premier thinktank, racing against time to meet the deadline, has forwarded the key document to the PMO for vetting.
 
 An official said the action plan aimed at accelerating economic growth and making it more inclusive by focusing on employment generation. He added that the action plan was likely to take into account the impact of demonetisation on the economy.
 
 The vision document is to be reviewed every three years with the first mid-term appraisal due in 2019-20, the year the next   award is implemented. “The plan is to align it with the recommendations of the Finance Commission,”an official said. The Planning Commission, set up by Jawaharlal   in 1950, was replaced with 
  which, unlike the former, is not involved in allocation of plan funds.
