Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has invited nine renowned sculptors to make nine theme-based sculptures for the city. The sculptors are likely to arrive in the next 10 days to carve out sculptures from white,  , green, pink and yellow sand stones for the beautification of the city. 

 “It is essential for an urban place to develop on its identity. These pieces of art would enhance landscaping of different parts of the city besides imparting knowledge. This activity would introduce people to a new stream of art that serves the purpose of outdoor education,” municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said. 
 
 The sculptors namely Vinod Patel (Vadodara); Sunil Shridhar (Surat); Robin David (Bhopal); Rajshekhar Nair (Kerala); Vikas Khajuria (J&K); Debasis Bera (Kolkata); Yama Moto (Japan); Li Chiara (Italy) and Kemji Toda (Japan) would make sculptures which are more than 10 feet in height with special stones brought for the purpose. 
 
 Recently SMC got 10 murals made of iron waste displayed at different spots in the city. 
 
 “We expect students and sculptors to immensely benefit from this initiative of ours,” Thennarasan added. 
 
 An officer of SMC said Surat lacks a keen artistic sense. When a civic body, which besides providing basic amenities to people, also takes care to develop the artistic sensibility of its denizens, there is nothing like it, he added.
