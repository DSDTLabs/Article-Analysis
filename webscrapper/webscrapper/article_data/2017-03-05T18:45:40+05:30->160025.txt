 He added, "Akhilesh claims that ' ' (actions speak). But the reality is that UP tops when it comes to crimes against women and here 'karnama bolta hai' (misdeeds speak)."

 In reply to various parties ridiculing the PM's 'acchhe din' slogan, the BJP chief said, "Hear this loud and clear, UP's 'acchhe din' would begin from 1 pm on March 11 as soon as the BJP would form its government in UP."
 
 He also told Akhilesh that one needs guts and spine to bring development to a state like Uttar Pradesh.
