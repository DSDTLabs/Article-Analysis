HYDERABAD:   became the latest richie rich, thanks to the Indian Premier League (IPL). For the 22-year-old pacer from Hyderabad, whose father plies an autorickshaw for a living, it was a surreal dream playing out at the   auction as Hyderabad-based outfit   bagged him for 2.6 crore on Monday. 

  With no formal coaching, it has been a steady rise up the ranks as Siraj graduated from Hyderabad under-22 to Ranji, before playing in the   tournament, where he caught the eye of the IPL talent scouts. That his coach at Hyderabad - Bharat Arun - is well versed with Siraj's pace helped the youngster. Arun works for   Bangalore. 
 
  They were the first to bid for the youngster, who was also in the India 'A' squad that played Australia in the tour game. "Mere walid saab (father) ne bahut mehnat ki hain (My father has worked very hard). He never let financial pressure of the family affect me or my elder brother. Bowling spikes cost a lot, but he would always get the best for me. I want to buy a house for them," Siraj said. P18
