BHOPAL: In an exclusive interview with the TOI, the Malegaon blasts accused  , who is out on conditional bail, has not ruled out her entry into politics. She said that she was ready to don any role as and when her country demands.

If she ever enters politics, what would be her place of choice, the Sadhvi prefered Madhya Pradesh. However, in the same breath, Pragya said, “But I have not nurtured any political ambition or otherwise. As a sanyasi, I have devoted my life to the country and I am ready to do anything and take any responsibility as and when the country demands.”
 
 About her arrest by ATS Mumbai, the Sadhvi said, “The main target of my arrest was RSS. The cops put a lot of pressure on me to admit my role in blast along with a few names of RSS functionaries. Since I am a Sanyasi, how would I lie, and yield to pressure from ATS.” 
 
 About the alleged torture that she underwent in custody, Pragya said, “I will take legal recourse to ensure that no woman or man is illegally detained and tortured in future.” 
 
 On senior   she said, “It was a conspiracy of Congress to frame me in all the cases and declare me a mastermind of all the blasts, but I had faith in god and judiciary.”
 
 About Madhya Pradesh chief minister  , Pragya said, “We all know one thing about Shivraj Ji whenever any such thing happens or any investigating agency comes to him for investigations, Shivraj Ji simply says that you conduct your investigations he will never put any obstacles, this is exactly happened in my case too‘(Shivraj Ji Sahajta Se Kehte Hain Ki Aap Jaanch Kariye rukawat nahi daalte, is prakaran mey bhi aisa hi hua)”.
