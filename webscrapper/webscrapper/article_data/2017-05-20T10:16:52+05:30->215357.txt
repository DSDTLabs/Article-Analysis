MHOW: A 42-year-old married man and his 20-year-old girlfriend allegedly committed suicide by consuming poison on Friday morning at   village of Bhabhra tehsil in   district. The man was father of five children and was cousin of the girl.

  Kanaji, a resident of Samlakund village under Barjhar police station limit had an affair with Madhu, a resident of the same village. When the family members of the duo came to know about their affair they scolded them and opposed their association. However, defying the family members concern the duo continued their relationship.
 
 On April 15, Madhu’s family members reached Kanaji’s house with a plan to attack him but he was not found in the house. As soon as Kanaji and Madhu came to know about their plan they met in a temple on the outskirts of the village. From there, they eloped to Gujarat.
 
 Nearly after a month on Thursday, the duo returned the village and came to learn that their families had disowned them. Reportedly, on Friday morning they reached an agricultural field outside the village and made a temple like structure with the mud at the field and then performed wedding rituals before consuming the poison.
 
 On Friday their bodies were spotted by a few villagers, who informed police about the incident.
 
 “On villagers call police reached the spot and sent the bodies to the Bhabhra civil hospital for post mortem. The duo had consumed celphos, which is used to preserve grains by the farmers, to end their lives,” Barjhar police station in-charge   told TOI.
