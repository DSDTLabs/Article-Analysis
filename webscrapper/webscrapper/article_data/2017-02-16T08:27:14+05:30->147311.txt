BENGALURU: The protesting taxi and auto drivers in front of the transport commissioner's office in   said that their montly income was so inadequate that they were unable to even pay their equated monthly instalments (EMIs). They said that banks seized at least 50 cars every month, following failure of drivers to honour their EMI commitments.

 President of the Bruhat Bengaluru Taxi Drivers' Union A Ramesh told TOI that app-based aggregator companies lured youngsters from rural areas of the state with unrealistic promises. “These youngsters sell their land, pledge their house and jewellery to make a down payment for a car. If you check with the Koramangala branch of the  , you will find that 50 cabs are seized every month,“ he added.
 
 He said that the drivers weren't earning enough in the city .“They end up losing their cars to the bank, and are seldom left with no other option but com mitting suicide. This is why you have as many cars congesting the streets of Bengaluru,“ Ramesh said.
 
 Vinod Kumar, who drives for Ola, said that the aggregator companies were not following government norms. “Transport department has made it mandatory for AC and non-AC cabs to charge Rs 19.50 and Rs 14.50 respectively per kilometre. But Ola charges just Rs 7 to 8 per kilometre, which chips away at our earnings,“ he said.
 
 He also pointed out that Ola was continuing its share service, despite the government barring the same.
 
 Another driver, Sriram Reddy said that they worked for up to 16 hours a day , but their pay was not commensurate with the effort. “Our EMI alone comes up to Rs 16,000, in addition to which we have to pay toll and bear the cost of repairs. We end up earning Rs 600 to Rs 1,000 daily. They also deduct tax from incentives, which get only after meeting impossible targets. We can't even buy enough diesel for our vehicles,“ he said.
