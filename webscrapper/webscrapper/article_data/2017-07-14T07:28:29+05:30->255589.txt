BENGALURU: Two men were admitted to a private hospital after unidentified assailants attacked them with blunt objects near   railway station on Tuesday evening. The incident took place in the aftermath of tension gripping the area when 200-odd students of madrasas travelling in a train from Guwahati to Bengaluru were stopped on the suspicion of being trafficked.

 Govindh Singh and   , residents of  , are undergoing treatment at Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital and their condition is stable, doctors said. According to complainant Sunil Kumar, who is a friend of the injured, all three of them had gone to the station on hearing that trouble was brewing there.
 
 “We saw there was confusion regarding the identities of the students who had arrived in Guwahati Express. Arguments and counter arguments were taking place. We were there till the evening and stepped out to have a cup of tea,“ Sunil said.
 
 When they were walking near  , a gang of 10-12 men attacked them, Sunil said. “They hit Govind and Nagaraju on the head and both sustained injures,“ he said.
 
 Sunil said they did not belong to any organization nor did they have links with right-wing outfits. “We were just spectators. We have no idea who attacked us and for what reason,“ he said.
 
 Jurisdictional police said they have registered a case and are on the lookout for the miscreants. “Unless we catch the culprits, it is difficult to ascertain the reason behind the attack. The complainant hasn't said in the FIR that the attack took place due to the incident at Cantonment railway station,“ police said.
