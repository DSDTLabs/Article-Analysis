KOLKATA: After the stretch from Golaghata to Lake Town, the Dum Dum Park-Bangur part, along with the canal off  , is all set to get a makeover.

 Initiated by Bidhannagar Trinamool MLA Sujit Bose, the Wasteland Development Corporation under the forest department has prepared a landscape enhancement project report to revamp the nearly 700m stretch.
 
 “The area falls under the state public works department (PWD). I discussed the plan with PWD and forest department officials, and the latter have prepared the project report. It will be a Rs 10-crore project to be funded by PWD,” Bose said.
 
 According to plans, the entire water stretch from Dum Dum Park to Bangur that now sports a shabby look with hyacinths and plastic waste will turn into a delightful place with clean water. There will be a children’s park, walking zones, lighting and planting enhancement and seating areas on the flanks of the canal. There will also be herbal and butterfly gardens and fountains.
 
 There is also a plan to set up an aquarium with an observatory. Planting trees along the service road off VIP Road is also on cards. The waterbody covers an area of 2,520sqm and the service road is approximately 680m long.
 
 Bose is already working on plans to turn the service road from Lake Town to Ultadanga into a weekend Walking Street. A small waterbody at Lake Town has already been decorated and the footbridge across it also decked up with lights. “We are also working on plans to set up subways in Golaghata and Lake Town for the convenience of pedestrians,” Bose said.
