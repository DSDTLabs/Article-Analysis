AHMEDABAD: The state government’s plan from August last year, to provide meals to labourers for Rs 10, may roll out by April-end this year. The delay has been because the state could not acquire the required equipment in time.

 The Gujarat government now hopes to begin the supply of subsidized meals by the end of this month. “We were in the process of finalizing tenders and buying vehicles to supply the meals,” said Dilip Thakor, labour and employment minister.
 
 The government decided to provide subsidized meals, but this will only cover the 25,000 labourers registered with the   (GBSKB).A proposal seeking land for a facility was sent to   ( ), and this was allotted. Officials said the AMC’s standing committee sanctioned the allotment in September. The scheme is yet to begin, some six months after that clearance. “We need vehicles which can keep the food hot and fresh. It is a time-consuming process and we have hence not been able to implement the scheme,” an official said.
 
 Officials said the labour and employment department, wanted to start with the 25,000 workers registered with GBSKB in four cities — Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Vadodara, and Rajkot. They plan to extend it to other parts of the state later.
 
 Construction labourers will get a packed lunch of dal, subzi, roti and chutni for Rs 10. The department has tied up with   for the scheme. Each meal costs Rs 42.50. The workers will pay Rs 10 and the government will cover the rest.
