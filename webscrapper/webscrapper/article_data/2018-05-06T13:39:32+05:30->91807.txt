PATNA:   (EESL) started the work of replacing the existing sodium vapour street lights with energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs in Patna on Friday evening.

 “The installation of 50,000 LED bulbs in all 75 wards, divided into Bankipore, Pataliputra, Patna City and   circles, will take almost three months. The project is being executed by EESL under the supervision of the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) at an estimated cost of Rs 45 crore,” a PMC engineer said on Saturday.
 
 Initially, prominent city areas like Bailey Road, Beer Chand Patel Marg, Exhibition Road and Fraser Road will be covered. In fact, the LED installation work between I-T roundabout and Patna High Court mazaar has been completed in a day.
 
 According to Patna mayor Sita Sahu, work will now begin in 14 other wards — 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 20, 25, 26, 27, 37 and 38 — whose councillors have submitted survey reports giving details of the exact number of LED bulbs required in their respective areas.
 
 “The councillors have also marked the spots where electric poles need to be installed for proper lighting. Others will conduct the survey in their wards from May 10 and submit the report in a week or two,” Sahu said.
 
 Earlier, at least 850 LED bulbs were put up on major routes like Ashiana-Digha Road, Boring Canal Road, Airport Road, 1, Anne Marg, Secretariat, Gandhi Maidan and Patna City. According to sources, these bulbs were installed last year before and after the closing ceremony of the Prakashotsava.
