A portion of the ground is being barricaded and earmarked for the purpose, for free of cost. The existing parking site at the ground has been shifted to the space adjoining the demonstration site,” said a senior official of the north corporation. 
 
 He said, “The remaining portion of the Ramlila ground may be used as per the prevailing policy of the department. People who want to hold demonstrations should apply and get permission from the city zone office and no-objection certificate from Delhi Police. A security amount of Rs 5,000 will also have to be submitted, which will be refundable and the NGOs should provide proof of registration.”
