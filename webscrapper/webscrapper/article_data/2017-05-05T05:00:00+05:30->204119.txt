 has been roped in to play a pivotal role in the Telugu remake of acclaimed 2012 Marathi film, ' '.   is directing the movie that revolves around four adolescents who unwittingly set out on a quest for sexual enlightenment, while trying to find out why one of the boy’s elder sister is asked to leave the locality for bringing disgrace to the family. In the process they stumble upon adult magazines, spy on a young couple in the locality and even set out to watch a porn film together. 
“The film is a fun drama that stresses on the importance of sex education for adolescents and why parents must communicate transparently with their children. I play a 23-year-old college going girl — the character played by   in the original — who finds out that these kids aged between 11-14 are up to hanky panky stuff when their parents are not at home. She notices how their behaviour towards her changes after their exposure to sex. So she makes it her mission to counsel them and make them understand that what they are doing is not correct,” says Tejaswi, adding, “Sex education is very relevant in today’s world where children have access to adult content across media. So it has become all the more important for parents to educate kids about sex and talk to them 
 about it.”
