Mumbai: New York-headquartered  , a global merchant bank focused on technology,   ( ), has set up shop in India. The company has appointed Gaurav Mehta — former head of UBS India’s investment banking division — as managing director.

 Raine will operate through a newly formed Indian subsidiary, which is in the process of establishing. It expects to complete this process, locate office space and commence operations by early May. “We are seeing an increasing amount of M&A and investment activity in the TMT space, as well as potential expansion opportunities for our portfolio companies,” said Brandon Gardner, president of Raine.
 
 The firm’s decision to set up an office, comes on the back of it completing a few India-related transactions from its global office. Most recently, Raine advised on a number of transactions, including advising   on its investment in   and   on its capital raise from  . The firm has also assisted several of its portfolio companies and global clients in developing strategic partnerships in India.
 
 According to Mehta, the firm wants to play both ends — capital raising and M&A advisory. While India is already seeing consolidation on telecom and traditional media, Mehta expects capital raising in new sectors.
 
 “There has been a significant increase in mobile internet access in India over the past year. As India is a mobile first country, a new ecosystem is being created. There are businesses growing on the back of this. We are seeing capital raising activity happening on the digital content and gaming side. We have also started seeing activity happening in the OTT (over the top) space,” said Mehta. OTT content refers to audio, video, and other media content delivered over the internet without the involvement of a multiple-system operator (MSO) controlling distribution.
