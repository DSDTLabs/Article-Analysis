CHENNAI:   and   never went to an English medium school, but like many toiling for a better life they dreamed of sending their child to one. When their four-year-old son   got enrolled at  , it was a dream come true for the family that runs on the meagre earnings of a mason.

 Often, the child recited English rhymes and brought joy to his parents who had grown up seeing the well-off speak fluently the foreign tongue. On Friday morning, before Kirtheeswaran left for school, Mohan saw him running around; a couple of hours later he was told that his son had died. The parents were called to the   morgue where their child lay motionless wrapped in a shroud.
 
 Neighbours flooded the mortuary to console Sasikala who refused to believe that her child had died. “We admit children in private school believing that more care is taken. How can they let the child out alone when the lid of a tank was kept open?” said Sasikala.
 
 Her neighbours remember Kirtheeswaran as a boy who loved to talk. “He kept us engaged with his nonstop talk. He was always spotted in the neighbour’s house where he would recite rhymes and dance to tunes from Vijay’s films” said Kasthuri, a neighbour.
 
 Mayilvizhi, another neighbour, wanted the school authorities to get punished. “No other child should meet such a tragic end. The school authorities should wake up now and ensure no such incidents happen in the future. They should be punished for this,” she said.
 
 Away from the group sat Abirami swiping her phone and looking at photographs of Kirtheeswaran. The teenager was the boy’s favourite ‘akka’. Till he joined school, he always accompanied Abirami in her car till her college. “I am lost for words. He would spend most of his time with me,” Abirami said before breaking down.
