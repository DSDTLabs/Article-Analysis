GURUGRAM: In anticipation of heavy showers from next week, power   Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) has been working on a war footing to prune trees, to avoid local faults that lead to power tripping during rain. 

 Discom officials say the pruning drive is going on in full swing in DLF City. “We have been trimming trees for over a week. Now that another spell of rainfall is expected, we have sped up the process,” said subdivision officer DLF City, Kuldeep Nehra.
 
 Apart from DLF City, the pruning exercise is also being carried out in Sohna, South City, Maruti and other subdivisions.
 
 “Trees grow at a very past face during monsoon. Normally we prune trees after every three months. But during monsoon, we keep a tab on the growth and do it accordingly,” said Nehra.
 
 Gurgaon has a network of overhead power lines, unlike Delhi. The line system is expected to be this way until the smart grid project is completed, after which the power system will be completely immune to bad weather. TNN
