COIMBATORE: If the available information is anything to go by, most number of   in the city happens at pedestrian crossings. Of the 245   in 2015, 58 were killed at pedestrian crossings.

 TOI spoke to the traffic police department and found that there was lack of civic infrastructure for the pedestrian population. Planning experts TOI spoke to expressed a similar view.
 
 According to a senior officer attached to traffic police department, the city lacks enough foot over-bridges or subways that will allow pedestrians to cross roads safely. “We have seen a kind of reluctance among the public in climbing foot over-bridges. When we spoke to some of them, they said they do not want to climb. But, in a city like Chennai people are open about using subways,” the cop said.
 
 Another traffic cop many pedestrians often jump medians to cross the road. “This is because we do not have enough pedestrian crossings in the city. There are very few and we are working on adding more,” the cop said.
 
 Planning experts feel that pedestrians were never given importance in Coimbatore. “Under the smart city plan, designs have been made to set up some pavements. But, that will cover only a very small area of the city,” said trustee of   for Governance, Coimbatore, S Baskar. “We have three-four arterial roads in Coimbatore which have six or four lanes. While they have centre medians, none of them have proper pedestrian crossings,” he added.
 
 Unless there is a pedestrian island in between the road, how pedestrians will cross the road, Baskar asked. “The central government had chalked out a plan to first create pedestrian infrastructure in cities and then work on introducing metro rails. Urban development minister   had said this,” he further said.
 
 The planning expert also pointed out that there was a need for standards to set up pavements. “When we are laying pavements, they should be at least 6ft wide and 4-6 inches heigh. Otherwise, they are of no use,” Baskar said.
