UTTARKASHI: Almost a decade after its inauguration, government apathy and mismanagement still pose roadblocks for the students of Rajeev Gandhi Navodaya Vidyalaya in Chinyalisaur.
 
  Started as a co-educational boarding school affiliated to CBSE in 2009, the aim of the institution is to give equal educational opportunities for bright underprivileged students. However, in the absence of proper infrastructure and residential facilities, 49 girls and 56 boys who study in the institution share five rooms and a toilet. These rooms also double up as classrooms in the morning hours.
  
  A recent inspection by municipality chairman   has revealed severe mismanagement and unhygienic conditions in the facility. “All students are sharing the same toilet, which has become a breeding ground for infections. The rooms are damp due to leakage in the drainage system.” “Some children have fallen ill due to lack of basic facilities in the school. They were referred to the community health centre, where they were prescribed the necessary medicines. For the time being, I have allocated Rs 2 lakh from the civic body funds for the construction of more toilets and repairs of the drainage system.”
  
  Talking to TOI, Dr.  , head of  , said, “During the medical check-up, 44 students were found to be suffering from fever, cold and cough. We have given them the necessary medicines and they are recovering.”
  
  Confirming that lack of proper infrastructure is a problem in the school, Devendra Singh Negi, SDM of Bhatwari, said, “We are planning to find a better place for the students till a new building is constructed. We will talk to senior officials regarding the funds for constructing the proposed hostel.”
  
  Meanwhile,  , principal of the school, said that they are trying to provide the best facilities to the students even though there are some issues due to lack of proper infrastructure.
