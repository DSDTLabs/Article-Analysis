PUNE: Men occupying women’s   on Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited ( ) buses, beware! You could be hauled to the nearest police station for refusal to vacate seats meant for the fairer sex.

 PMPML has instructed drivers and conductors to ensure that seats   for   on buses run by the transport body are not occupied by men. It has also asked drivers to take the bus to the nearest police station if men refuse to vacate seats meant for women.
 
 The instructions were issued after women commuters complained that seats meant for them were being occupied by men and the transport body had not bothered to right the wrong.
 
 Sarika Jagtap, a Kondhwa resident, said that she faced problems almost daily. “Men occupy our seats and turn a deaf ear when we request them to vacate the seats meant for ladies. They pick up a quarrel when we insist that they vacate the seats. There have been many instances when I have found myself arguing with men older than me. They simply do not care and the conductor too chooses to ignore,” she told TOI.
 
 PMPML officials said that the seats on the left are reserved for women. “A standard bus has a capacity of 50-55 seats in addition to standing capacity of around 15. There is a problem about seats meant for women being occupied by others and this needs to stop,” PMPML public relations officer (PRO)   told TOI.
 
 Kalindi, a student, said that things have turned ugly many times. “I travel to PMC from Hadapsar every day and getting a seat is a major hassle most of the time. I have been even threatened with dire consequences by male commuters after I sternly told them to vacate the seats as some women were standing. Now I don’t argue as I fear the worst,” she said.
 
 “We have told the conductors to remind the men about reserved seats. If there are no women on a bus, they can occupy these seats but if a woman boards the bus they should vacate the reserved seats,” another official told TOI.
