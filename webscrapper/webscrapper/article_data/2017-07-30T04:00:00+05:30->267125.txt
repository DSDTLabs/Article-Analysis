Vadodara: An undertrial at Vadodara Central Jail was caught with a mobile phone stuck in his shoes on Saturday by a jail official. A case was registered against the undertrial Shravan Kanskiwala and his friend Ajay with whom he had exchanged the shoes.

 Police said that on Saturday, Kanskiwala, accused in a rape case, was taken to district court for hearing. When he returned to the jail, he was limping which raised suspicion among the jail officials. When a jail sentry frisked Kanskiwala and checked his shoes, a mobile phone was found stuck in it.
 
 During the interrogation, Kanskiwala admitted that he got the phone from his friend Ajay with whom he had exchanged shoes in the court. Cops said that Ajay was also lodged in the jail until a few days ago. Both, Kanskiwala and Ajay had become friends in jail since they shared the barrack.
