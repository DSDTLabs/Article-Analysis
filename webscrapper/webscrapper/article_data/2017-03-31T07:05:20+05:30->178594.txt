NEW DELHI: The government has cleared Captain Arvind   as Air India’s director operations. Captain Kathpalia, who was AI’s ED (operations), had been grounded for allegedly skipping pre-flight breath analyser test. He told an inquiry panel he was getting late for a flight and hence skipped the test. The appointment committee of cabinet cleared his name as director.

 He has been appointed director for five years, said sources. AI had proposed his name for the director position last year. He ran into rough weather earlier this year following allegations of skipping the pre-flight test. The   then suspended his flying licence for three months.
 
 Kathpalia told the probe panel that he had driven straight to the aircraft after attending a meeting with officials of the civil aviation regulator as the flight was getting late. However, it is mandatory for the pilots to undertake the breath analyser test to ensure that they are not drunk before entering the cockpits.
 
 The airline had recently made him ED (special projects), appointing another pilot as head or ED of operations.
