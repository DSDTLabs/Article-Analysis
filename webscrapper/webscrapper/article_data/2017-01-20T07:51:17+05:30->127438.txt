HYDERABAD: Customs officials caught a smuggler when he landed at the   from Muscat carrying 467 gm of gold moulded into thin foils on Thursday morning. The smuggler told customs officials that Chinese gangs in Dubai were converting gold bars into thin foils for smuggling at airports. 

 The offender, reportedly in his early 30s, claimed that he was a businessman dealing in garments from Kasaragod district of Kerala, notorious for gold smuggling activity. The customs officials found four gold foils tightly wrapped in black polythene and concealed in the walls of a corrugated box. 
 
 The culprit had purchased the gold foil layers in Dubai. However to hoodwink customs officials, instead of taking a flight from Dubai to Kerala or Karnataka, he went to Muscat and then boarded an Oman Air flight (WY 235) to Hyderabad. 
 
 The mention of Kasaragod on his passport and his travel pattern made the   (AIU) detectives suspicious and they ripped apart the corrugated box containing clothes and found the gold. The value of the gold has been pegged at 13.64 lakh. On interrogation, he confessed he had purchased gold from Chinese jewellers, who would charge a little extra to convert gold bars into thin foils to easily smuggle the yellow metal.
