Erode: Three days ahead of his retirement, deputy superintendent of police ( ) Suresh Kumar was on Saturday placed under suspension in connection with a lock-up death in Kanyakumari district, where he served as an inspector (Special Branch).

 According a source, Suresh Kumar was promoted as DSP and posted in Erode district three months ago. Earlier, he was inspector with Kanyakumari district Special Branch.
 
 The Vadaseri police in Kanyakumari arrested one Duraisingam, a registered siddha medical practitioner, in connection with a murder case in 2009. He died in the police custody.
 
 Following his death, an advocate from Nagarcoil approached the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court seeking justice in Duraisingam’s death. The bench ordered a CBI inquiry into the incident.
 
 During the probe, CBI officials found Suresh Kumar’s involvement in the lock-up death and submitted the report before the court, recommending action against the official. “The case is still pending with the court,” said a source.
 
 Meanwhile, Erode SP Sivakumar shot off a letter to DGP Rajendran saying Suresh Kumar was set to retire from service on July 31. “The DGP issued the suspension order to Suresh Kumar on Saturday, citing the case was pending with the high court,” the source added.
