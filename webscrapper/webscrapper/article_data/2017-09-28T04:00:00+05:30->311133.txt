Vadodara: Six students of Faculty of Science of M S University (MSU) were arrested for assaulting rival group’s members on the campus on Wednesday.

 Bhargav Motavar, a student of the faculty and member of Royal Group, told police in his complaint that some students of the group had gone to meet faculty dean A C Sharma to postpone their exams scheduled to begin from October 7. When the students were making representations, some students of AISA group reached there and started abusing them.
 
 Motavar and others asked them to refrain from using expletives, which led to heated arguments between the two groups. Satnamsingh Bhatti, one of the arrested students, hit Motavar with his bracelet after which other members of AISA group started thrashing others. Soon, the vigilance staff of the university reached there and controlled the situation.
 
 After Motavar, who received injuries near his ears, registered the FIR at Sayajigunj police station, police arrested Bhatti, Ravirajsinh Jadeja, Paramjeetsingh Sehgal, Pushkar Singh, Ankur Khandelwal and Brij Kishor Brhambhatt.
 
 After Wednesday’s violence, A C Sharma, dean of Faculty of Science, warned around 35 students of disciplinary action if they indulge in violence again. He has also warned that nomination of candidates may get cancelled.
 
 With MSU Students’ Union poll dates nearing, the police have increased the vigil in the campus to avert any violence.
