BENGALURU: Traders at the APMC ( ) yard in Bengaluru's Yeshwantpur say their businesses are back to normal ­ or almost normal ­ after some disruption in the months of November and December following  . The APMC yard is the wholesale trading hub for foodgrains and pulses.

 While Balaji Ram Kishor of Sai Balaji Marketing said he suffered only a 5-10% decline in business, Aradash Polepalli of Rajdeep Trading Company was the only one, among those TOI spoke to, who said his business is still down by 60%. He said that business was down 80% soon after demonetisation. For some time, availability of items were affected because of the impact of demonetisation on movement of trucks. But this problem is now largely resolved.
 
 Most stores in the area now accept payment through digital modes of payment, with many accepting Paytm. Syed, who runs  , said, “Smaller businesses were affected more by the ban on the old Rs 500 an d Rs 1,000 notes because they dealt mostly in cash. He said big businesses recovered soon after the new Rs 2,000 notes came into circulation.“ Most sellers said there has been an increase in the use of swipe machines, some complained about the cap of Rs 20,000 on transactions via digital wallets like Paytm, saying it was too low. Most said prices of foodgrains and pulses had dropped and attributed it to the generally dull market.
 
 Traders differed in their views on demonetization, with some saying there were no visible benefits of the move. “People are used to cash and moving to a cashless system, without necessary infrastructure, is difficult,“ said Polepalli. Bharath of  , on the other hand, said he believed demonetization would lead to more accountability. “GST will make the system even better ­ for us and for the government,“ he said.
