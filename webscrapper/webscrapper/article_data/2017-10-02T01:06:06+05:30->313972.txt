Tirupur: Two persons snatched Rs 8.76 lakh from a TASMAC shop employee when he was returning home in the city on Saturday. 

 It was the second such incident happening to the state-run IMFL shop employees in past one month in Tirupur district.
 
 M Thamarai Saravanan, a resident of Karunaipalayam Pirivu, was working as a supervisor of the TASMAC shop located on Rakkiyapalayam road at Anaipudur. After completing the sales on Saturday night, Saravanan started for home on his motorbike carrying the sales collection of Rs 8.76 lakh, said police sources.
 
 As per the first information report, when Saravanan was just 400 metres away from the shop, two persons who came on a bike pushed his vehicle down. 
 
 Before Saravanan recovered, the miscreants snatched the money from a cover on the vehicleâ€™s petrol tank and fled the spot, a police officer said.
