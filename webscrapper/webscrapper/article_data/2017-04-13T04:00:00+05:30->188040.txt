Mumbai: Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of the banking sector are estimated to be in the range of 9.7-10% of total assets as of end March 2017, according to rating agency  . While the rate of NPA creation had slowed the fourth quarter, gross   increased resulting in the stock of   rising to Rs 7.5 to Rs 7.7 lakh crore.

 As a result of growth in NPAs and due to increased capital requirements under new international norms, banks will need Rs 1.2 lakh crore to Rs 1.3 lakh crore equity capital by FY2019. As against this, the government has announced capital infusion of Rs 20,000 crore.In a research note published today ICRA said that the fresh additions to gross NPAs (GNPAs) during Q3 FY2017 stood lower at Rs 26,400 crore as compared to Rs 1.36 lakh crore during the first nine months of FY2017, partly aided by higher write-offs during the last quarter.
 
 According to Karthik Srinivasan, senior vp in charge of financial sector ratings at ICRA: around 55% of fresh NPAs generated during January-March `17 quarter and around and around 77% of NPAs created in between April `16 to December `16 were loans other than those already restructured. Restructured loans are also advances where borrowers are facing stress but not classified as NPAs as they have been given more time to repay.
 
 ICRA is also skeptical over the   scheme (which gives banks powers to change management) preventing loans from going bad. “The large share of advances undergoing resolution through various schemes on resolution of stressed assets, especially the strategic debt restructuring ( ) scheme, is also a matter of concern,” the rating agency said.
 
 In ICRA’s sample set of 61 large borrowers having a total debt of Rs 2.45 lakh crore, are currently undergoing a resolution through the SDR scheme. As on December 31, 2016, 72% of the debt continues to be classified as “standard” advance on account of the applicability of the standstill clause on asset classification under the SDR scheme.
