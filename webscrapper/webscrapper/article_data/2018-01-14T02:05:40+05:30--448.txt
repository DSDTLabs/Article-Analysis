NEW DELHI: Two months after two women were molested at the ITO   station,   and security agencies have decided to close desolate entry-exit points late in the evening and at early hours. This means almost half the gates are now shut early and opening late at six stations on Escorts Mujesar-Kashmere Gate (Violet) Line. 

 On November 13, two women were molested within a span of 15 minutes by the same man at   station, highlighting the lack of security at some metro gates. Following the incidents,   (DMRC), along with Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), had said more   cameras would be placed at such places to avoid having any “blind spot” at the stations. More frequent security patrolling was also promised to make commuters, especially women, feel safe. 
 
 However, now DMRC and CISF have decided to close these ‘troublesome’ gates at night and in the first hour. The closing hours vary between 9pm and 10pm for different stations, while the opening hour is 7am. The metro starts running at 6am and go on till about 11.45pm at these stations. At   station, for instance, gate numbers 1, 4 and 5 are now being shut at 9pm, while at ITO station, gate numbers 3 and 4 are remaining closed after 10pm. 
 
 Similar measures are also being taken at Janpath, Lal Quila, Khan Market and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium stations, which have their share of long, desolate corridors connecting the gates to the security checkpoint areas. 
 
 A DMRC spokesperson said the decision had been taken as the footfall of commuters was quite low in these stations during these hours. “This is being done to facilitate security of passengers in these areas,” he added. “However, this is a temporary step and will be reviewed after taking feedback from commuters.” “This is a preventive measure. These gates see much less movement,” said a CISF spokesperson.
