New Jersey senator   asked Mindy Kaling out for a dinner date on   and the actress happily accepted.
 
  
 
  
  It all began when Booker commented on Kaling's show, "The Mindy Project" in which the main character, Mindy Lahari, dissed the city of Newark, New Jersey, reported  .
  
  "Ouch! @MindyKaling, heard Dr Lahiri dissed Newark last night... @VogueMagazine and I disagree. I still (heart) you," he wrote with a link to a Vogue magazine article raving about the New Jersey city.
  
  
  
  
  To which Kaling, 37, replied, "Senator, if Mindy Lahiri shades it, it means we know it's cool. Thanks for the (love). It's mutual!"
  
  Booker, 47, then said her response was "making my day! Thanks for the clarification."
  
  
  
  
  "And If the (love) is really mutual... Come have dinner with me in Newark? #PleaseSayYes," he boldly added.
  
  
  
  
  It did not take long for the actress to say 'yes' to Booker's dinner proposal as she said, "@CoryBooker yes. Now let me get the PATH train schedule.
