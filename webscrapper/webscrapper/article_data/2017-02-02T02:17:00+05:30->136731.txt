Lucknow: UP’s small traders involved in businesses of hardware, electronics, printing, repair garages with annual turnover up to Rs 2 crore are happy to see the presumptive   limit being lowered from 8% to 6% per crore in 2017 budget. Earlier, benefit was only for those with turnover of up to Rs 1 crore, which is now extended to Rs 2 crore. 

 This implies that those with a turnover of up to Rs 2 crore can easily declare profit of Rs 12 lakh (6 lakh per crore) without having to worry about maintaining or showing records to IT department. But all transactions have to be cashless. The turnover limit of already running industries which need to avail bank loan for working capital has been increased from Rs 1 to 2 crore which would be of great help to small traders too. 
 
 Anil Gupta, an entrepreneur and ex-president of IIA—one of the leading MSMEs association—said the move will prevent unnecessary   small traders faced while showing sales records. They can project their income easily as Rs 12 lakh without having to worry about IT department’s scrutiny. 
 
 UP traders also welcomed FM’s decision to increase the funds allocation for startups under PM Mudra Yojna by almost 50%. Manish Goel-IIA’s national president said this will encourage new entrepreneurs of UP to avail loan from banks for startups without a collateral (third party guarantee or mortgaging property, stocks etc). 
 
 CII member Tanay Agarwal also referred to Centre’s announcement to develop an electronic manufacturing hub in India. He said, “There are many MSMEs in UP manufacturing electronic and supplying to big industries. The decision will help UP MSMEs in a big way.”
