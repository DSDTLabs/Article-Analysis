AURANGABAD: The ruling and the   corporators are all set to question the   for allegedly mishandling the city’s solid   system in the upcoming   meeting scheduled for Friday.

 The meeting has been called to discuss the status of solid waste management in the city.
 
 Looking at effort to streamline the solid waste management system in the last one year, the municipal authority officials were hoping to achieve a place in the top 20 clean cities across the country but unfortunately, the city stood at 299th position. 
 
 Disheartened by the poor ranking, the mayor Bapu Ghadamode called a special general body meeting to discuss and improve the city’s ranking next time. 
 
 BJP corporator Raj Wankhede said that he would seek explanation from the municipal administration. “Many cities where infrastructure and other facilities are not up to the mark have performed better than us. It shows that the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) could have achieved a good score,” he said. 
 
 Wankhede alleged that lack of co-ordination among the municipal authority officials and sanitary workers is a major setback for this poor ranking. “I will certainly raise this point in the general body meeting,” he said. 
 
 Shiv Sena corporator Raju Vaidya said the municipal authorities have enough resources to effectively manage the solid waste across the city. “I have found that the sanitary workers have maintained cleanliness in the city for a very short period of time”, he said. 
 
 “I am very surprised to see that our performance came out so bad. We have been doing satisfactory work in door to door collection, segregation of dry and wet garbage and treating garbage at various processing units, said Vikram Mandurke assistant municipal commissioner.
