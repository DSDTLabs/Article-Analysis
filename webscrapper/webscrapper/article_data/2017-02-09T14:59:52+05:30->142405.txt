CHENNAI: On an audacious claim amidst reports and 
  in luxury buses and lodged in resorts, the   government told the Madras high court on Thursday that all 
  convened here on Wednesday by party general secretary V K   — who is waiting to be the next chief minister — were now staying at the MLA Hostel in Chennai. The meeting was held after caretaker chief minister   revolted against her. 

 They are absolutely free to move around, Tamil Nadu government's additional public prosecutor told a bench of Justice M Jaichandren and Justice T Mathivanan. 
 
 Earlier in the morning, social activist K R ‘Traffic’ Ramaswamy and PMK functionary and advocate K Balu mentioned the matter before a division bench of the high court on Wednesday. He said the MLAs were in unlawful detention and that they should be set at liberty.
 
 While Ramaswamy alleged that all the 130-odd 
  , Balu said   MLA representing Kunnam constituency in Ariyalur district, R T Ramachandran had gone missing after attending a party meeting a couple of days ago. 
 
 They wanted their habeas corpus petitions for the release of MLAs to be taken up as urgent matter. 
 
 Representing a voter, M R Ilavarasan, he said the MLA was not accessible by phone also. Responding to this, and denying unlawful custody of the MLAs, the additional public prosecutor told the bench that all the party MLAs were in their apartments at MLA Hostel in Chennai, and they were absolutely free. 
 
 The judges then questioned the need for urgent hearing when the government side had made a categorical submission that they were staying in  . They also said if the petitioners were of such a view, why they didn’t file public interest litigations.
 
 Ruling out urgent hearing at 2.15pm, as demanded by them, the bench said it would hear the case if it was brought before it in normal course.
