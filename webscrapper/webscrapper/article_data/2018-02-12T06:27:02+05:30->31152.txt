  : A third year student, allegedly abducted by her spurned lover, was rescued by police after a hunt that lasted for over 12 hours. The prime suspect and his associates are still at large. 

 The girl, who is a part-time worker at a Baruipur shop, was returning home in a Toto on Saturday night. Around 9.30pm, Posen Rong (26) - the main accused - and his aides waylaid the Toto and pulled the girl out of the vehicle when it slowed down at a speed breaker about half a km from her house. Rong sped away with the girl in an SUV.
 
 Police kept tracking Rong's movement through mobile phone towers. But each time police came close, Rong managed to give them slip. Finally, the girl was found inside an under construction building in Sonarpur.
 
 According to police, the girl had an affair with Rong. But recently, she started avoiding him after her parents came to know about his alleged anti-social activities. The youth had allegedly been threatening the girl and her family after she decided to break up. In fact, her father had lodged a complaint against him with the Sonarpur police about a week ago. This infuriated Rong who allegedly went to the girl's house three days ago and threatened to kill her if she did not marry him.
 
 "We have rescued the girl. We are hopeful of nabbing the suspects soon," said Baruipur SP Arijit Sinha.
