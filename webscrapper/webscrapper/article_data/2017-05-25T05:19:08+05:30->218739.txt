MUMBAI: A witness deposing in the journalist J Dey murder trial told the MCOCA special judge Sameer Adkar he had received a call from   in August 2011. Police had taped the conversation, which took place two months after Dey's murder in Mumbai. 

 Special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat played the brief taped conversation in court on Wednesday to prove its contents and fix the identity of the caller. In the conversation, Rajan is heard telling the witness that accused Jigna Vora, also a journalist, used to keep on calling him to say things "against him (Dey)" and that he had worked for the rival gang.
 
 Vora has been charged for furnishing information which facilitated the killing. She has been out on bail since July 2012.
 
 The prosecution had earlier submitted a forensic report in court of a positive voice match from the voice in the tape and with that of Rajan.
 
 Two sharpshooters had fired at Dey from two motorcycles in Powai, with two men in a four-wheeler alongside. 
 
 In court, the witness, a real estate broker, said his statements were recorded in Marathi by the police and a magistrate, a language he said he did not understand. He said he did not recollect its content, but when asked by Gharat, he said whatever he had deposed before the magistrate was the "truth."
 
 In his statements, he said he had received a call from gangster Rajan twice in 2011. Police had recorded one conversation after receiving sanction to intercept it. The police officer who intercepted the conversation had deposed earlier as a witness.
 
 The witness did not deny the intercepted conversation. In the taped conversation, it was Rajan doing all the talking, and the witness was merely answering in monosyllables. But in court, during cross-examination by Rajan's defence lawyer Anshuman Sinha, the witness denied any other conversation between him and Rajan except one in 2006.
