Not every fan-star relationship has a happy ending. There have been numerous instances of fans crossing the line, but   has experienced one bizarre incident of obsession. 

 The incident took place recently, when a guy started messaging Pulkit on social media and even tried to reach out to him through the actor’s brothers. When his efforts did not bear fruit, the admirer started sending nude pictures of himself to Pulkit.
 
 A concerned Pulkit says, “Many people send me sweet messages, but this particular man overstepped the line. After he failed to get any response from me, he started spamming my brothers’ inbox with obscene pictures. I immediately blocked him and informed my team, who tried to connect with the cyber-crime cell.”
 
 However, the actor did not pursue the case legally, as he does not want the young man to suffer, and hopes that he mends his ways. We, too, hope that the fan backs off.
 
 The actor was recently seen in ' ', ' ' and ' '.
