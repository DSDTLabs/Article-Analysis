LUCKNOW: However badly the city may have fared in the Swachh Bharat Ranking, its lifeline Gomti river is in for an aquatic revival with the   ( ) offering to clean it with the help of plants and microbes. The scientific research institute has joined hands with   to rejuvenate the river. 

 A team of seven scientists led by NBRI director S K Barik will use   used for living plants to clean up the water contaminated with  . 
 
 "If all goes as per plan, we will be able to clean the river water up to 70% with the help of the biotechnology and the guidance of scientists of microbiology, plant science and water chemistry who have begun experimenting in lab," said Barik. 
 
 The scientists have collected the pollutant samples to begin biological treatment, he added.
 
 He added that the institute will be conducting the test on 10 plants that can help purify the river water. The best suited plant according to the weather conditions will be used for the cleaning process. Plants like typha and duckweed help clean the water, he said. The institute will be demonstrating the technologies used for cleaning Gomti and keeping it pollution-free by the end of this year.
 
 Barik said that after three months, NBRI will release the initial leads on which the technology will be based. The institute will also help manage solid waste by using appropriate technology to convert it into bio fertilisers.
 
 "The biggest problem is disposal of sewage sludge that pollutes the river. The institute will be treating it with microbes so that the sludge can be used as bio fertilisers," said senior principal scientist S K Tewari.
