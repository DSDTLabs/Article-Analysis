Hyderabad girl Eesha Rebba, who won critical acclaim for playing a lesbian in the recent release Awe, is thrilled about working in director Teja’s upcoming multi-starrer Aata Naade Veta Naade. Venkatesh and   play the lead roles in the multi-starrer touted to be an action thriller. “Yes, I am doing the project and I’m really thrilled. I play the love interest of Nara Rohit in the film,” says the Telugu girl adding, “This is the first film I’ve signed after Awe, so I consider this is as a reward for my performance.”

 While she is reluctant to reveal what her character in the film is like, Eesha promises that it will be a different one. “I’m not saying this just for the sake of saying it. When I say that my character will be different, it will indeed be different. I will start shooting from the last week of March,” says the   actress. 
 
 After playing a college student, Radha, who is in love with  , in her last outing, the term ‘different’ would definitely assume a whole different proposition now. Tell her that and she retorts saying, “When I agreed to do Awe, it was because the role was so different from anything I did so far. I did not think about anything else. To me a glamourous role is one that has a beautiful characterisation. Period!” 
 Meanwhile, speculation is rife that   was roped in to be cast opposite Venkatesh after   refused the role. A source close to the director disses the ‘rumours’ saying, “There is no truth in the 
 rumours that Kajal Aggarwal was first approached for the role. Why would Kajal refuse to work with Teja whom she considers to be her mentor? Also, it’s not true that Venkatesh is playing a professor. The entire drama though, will revolve around Venkatesh and Nara Rohit.”
