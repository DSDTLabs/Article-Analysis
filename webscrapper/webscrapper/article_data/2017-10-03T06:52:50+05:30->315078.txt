KOLKATA: Police and Puja organisers crushed many a  , but probably also prevented mishaps after they decided to   of   who were caught   in no-selfie zones.

 More than 3,000 cellphones got seized -and, subsequently returned to their rightful owners -at several pandals.
 
 The selfie ban was in place, most visibly at the Deshapriya Park and Tridhara Akal Bodhon Pujas in the south and at the Kumortulli Sarbojonin-Jagat Mukherjee Park Pujas in the north. At Tridhara, over 50 phones were confiscated on an average each day from Chaturthi. The cops claimed, however, that not one phone was actually taken back to the Lake police station. “We returned the phones to the rightful owners within 10 minutes. We told them that when we were trying to implement a selfie ban, it was important they took it seriously ,“ said a senior officer. In all, around 890 pho nes were “temporarily confiscated“ by cops at the two south Kolkata pandals alone.
 
 At the Kashi Bose Lane pandal, it was an altogether different story . Here, volunteers carrying white cardboards were hoisting them up each time anyone tried to click a selfie in front of the idol. “We just blanked out the backdrop to send a message.
 
 Even after announcements, some people ignored the directive. “The cops seized as many as 50 phones from our pandal on Puja days,“ said Debasish Kumar, general secretary of Tridhara.
 
 Cops said they had to be strict because the selfie craze had started to create problems since 2015.
 
 “Not only did it block exits, it was also a hazard as movement gets blocked, leading to a stampede-like situation,“ said a top Lalbazar officer.
