Their camaraderie off screen is full of friendly jibes and a lot of banter and that is what translates on screen, say actors   and  , who were in Bengaluru to promote their upcoming   Veerey Ki Wedding.“The film has a similar banter that you see now and it’s in the backdrop of a wedding, which is about Geet (played by Kriti) and Veer (played by Pulkit). Both of them share a volatile relationship in the film, where they cannot be with each other and cannot be away from each other either. They fall in love with each other every day but the problem begins as both our fathers don’t like each other,” says Pulkit.

 Prod them about their chemistry in the film and Kriti says, “We’re quite crazy and it’s mental. We survived.” When asked to share any funny moments during the shoot of the film, Pulkit says, “Oh there were many. The day we were shooting for a song, Kriti fainted on the set because it was too hot to handle (laughs) and I, like a gentleman, had to rush her to the hospital.” Though the actors are currently promoting their film, they are making the most of their trip to the city. The duo has been gorging on several traditional and old-time treats that the city is known for. “It feels amazing to be back in Bengaluru. I am already treating him to the   here. I told him, ‘You cannot land here at midnight and eat at the hotel’. I also love eating at home, whenever I am in the city. I always tell my mother ‘I’m coming, khana banake rakhna’,” says Kriti signing off.
