LUDHIANA: With MC elections in mind, the   MLAs are planning to give a new lease of life to several pending projects and come up with some new ones.

 Ludhiana city MLAs Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sanjay Talwar have envisaged a plan to announce a range of development projects worth Rs 500 crore for residents. The ball has already reached local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s court, and if everything goes as per plan, the city may get a shower of development projects before they go for the MC polls.
 
 Sources said Sidhu had also given an initial nod to the MLAs’ agenda, and the official announcement could be made anytime. The leaders want to get a formal announcement done through CM Captain  .
 
 Out of these projects, three include railway over bridges which have been hanging fire for the past so many years, and other projects related to improvement in sanitation, roads, sewerage, and other basic amenities.
 
 Some of the important development projects have been made part of the Smart City Mission. The only delay is in arranging funds to start these projects.
