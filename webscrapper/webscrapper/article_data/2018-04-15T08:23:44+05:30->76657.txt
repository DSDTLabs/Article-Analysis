LUCKNOW : The uncle of the rape survivor said on Saturday that he felt relieved after hearing Prime Minister   say that his niece will definitely get justice and the culprit will not be spared.

 “I have started eating food only after the assurance from the PM,” said the uncle of survivor before starting out on journey from   to Lucknow.
 
 They were under the protection of Unnao police and   sleuths. He added that he felt a sigh of relief after hearing the PM say, “Incidents being discussed from the past two days cannot be part of a civilised society. I want to assure the country that justice will be done and fully. Our daughters will get justice. It is an internal failing of our society and not at all fitting for any society that claims to be civilised and we are ashamed of it. We must address this issue together as a society.”
 
 PM   had given the statement on Friday.
