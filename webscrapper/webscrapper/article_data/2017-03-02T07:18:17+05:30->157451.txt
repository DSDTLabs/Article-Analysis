BALLIA:  ,  , is barely 10 days in the BJP , but quite a rage in  .Crowds go crazy , hooting as he struts up on stage and delivers his  : “Zindgi jhand ba, phir bhi ghamand ba.“ The sense of it: Life's a mess but such insufferable arrogance.

 On Wednesday , he used his killer line stumping for BJP's Ballia and Tamkuhi candidates. And, judging from audience reaction, the jab hit home.
 
 Clearly , he more than retains his charm. Pulling at a mop of hair on his forehead, he used his stock line to connect. Once that was done, he quickly switched over to election lingo, carefully touching on saffron talking points -Swachh Bharat, the toilet revolution, surgical strike against Pakistan.
 
 “I was in the middle of a shoot. But I put that on hold to be among you.I urge you to vote Balti Baba (Tamkuhi BJP candidate),“ he exhorts. The crowd whistles, claps, screams. Kishan turns to this reporter: “I joined BJP because I've become a huge fan of PM Modi. India is safe under him.“
 
 As he heads towards an open jeep, the crowd lunges at him, hugs him, begs for autographs. Kishan obliges. Tamkuhi Road is a seat in Kusinagar district.Party senior Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan, who is with him, was acerbic on stage. But she's been overshadowed. Kishan pulls the crowds. Draws applause. He's their hero.
 
 He signs off with an impromptu skit featuring them. “Are Pandit ji batai na biyah kab hoi?“ -the title of one of his many hits -he hollers into the mic, apparently referring to the date Balti Baba's seat will vote. The delirious crowd responds: “Chaar tarikh ke (On 4th)“. The actor goads: On March 4, all vote for the lotus. It will bring happiness to Bhojpuri samaj.“
