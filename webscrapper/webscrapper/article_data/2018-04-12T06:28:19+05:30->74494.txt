HYDERABAD: Unhappy with the   ( ) authorities’ efforts to protect   on camps, forest department officials have now taken it up on themselves and identified a 500-acre land parcel, at the southern side of the  , to develop it as a ‘protected zone.’ Speaking to TOI, officials said that for the past 10 days they have been inspecting different areas within the university to choose an ideal location for the purpose.

 “In April last year, we conducted a meeting and it was agreed that an area will be developed and all the wildlife will be moved to that particular area. However, so far that has been no development on that front. So, we have taken it up on ourselves and identified a location. The area is construction free and has three lakes – Buffalo, Peacock, and Mermaid — and good vegetation,” said A Shankar, officer on special duty, forest department adding that a meeting with UoH authorities will be held in a day or two to discuss the issue. The varsity will be asked to commit to time frame within which the area will be developed.
 
 “It is university’s land. So, we won’t be spending our money to develop the area. We will provide them with all the required guidance and help in setting up the area,” said Shankar.
 
 While stressing the need to curb wildlife death due to dog attacks, poaching and pollution, officials said the entire work will take not more than three months.
