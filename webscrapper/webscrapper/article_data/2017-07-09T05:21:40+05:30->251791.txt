NEW DELHI: The government said on Saturday that no tax officer had been authorised to visit premises of traders and shopkeepers without prior permission. The   ministry said such instances should be reported to its complaint helpline. 

  The ministry came out with the clarification for Delhi zone after reports that some unscrupulous elements, posing as   officers, tried to fleece shopkeepers and customers in the name of the new tax regime. 
 
  The chief commissioner of GST (Delhi zone) said the tax department "only wants to facilitate the process for shopkeepers and traders during the transition to the GST regime". The consumer affairs and revenue departments also came out with a clarification detailing how the revised   had to be calculated. It said that before printing or pasting the MRP, they should take into account the input tax credit. 
 
  The departments also said the declaration of new MRP on unsold stock, packed or imported prior to July 1, should not be done mechanically but after factoring in the extra availability of input tax credit under GST. A recent notification by the legal metrology wing of consumer affairs department had mandated manufacturers, sellers and importers to put the post-GST revised price on labels of packaged items that are yet to be sold. 
 
  On Friday, consumer affairs minister   had said that the stickers mentioning revised MRP alongside the   would be allowed till September 30. He said that putting both the prices won't result in violation of the legal metrology law since this relaxation had been given under the legal provisions because of the new tax law.
