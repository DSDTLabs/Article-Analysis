NEW DELHI:  , who left behind his wallet at New Delhi's   dargah crossing on Friday was in for a pleasant surprise, as he got it back hours later with all contents intact. An alert Delhi police sub Inspector who found it lying on the road tracked Jagpreet using a visiting card that was in his wallet.

 Jagpreet, a   resident, dropped his wallet while he was pushing his car that had broken down in the Nizammuddin area. It was only much later that he figured his wallet was missing. It contained his ATM card, PAN card, voter ID, some cash and foreign currency worth Rs 50,000.
 
 When he got a call from sub Inspector   on Sunday, asking him to collect his wallet, Jaspreet was taken aback. SI Madan Singh had noticed a cyclist picking up the wallet from the road and after verification contacted Jagpreet.
 
 The Preet Vihar resident was all praise for the honesty of the cop after he got back his wallet.
 
 "I was convinced the wallet was stolen and was ready to approach the police when I got the call. I was worried the cards would get misused and had prepared myself for the tedious process to reapply for them," said a beaming Jagpreet, who left a note praising the cop's honesty.
