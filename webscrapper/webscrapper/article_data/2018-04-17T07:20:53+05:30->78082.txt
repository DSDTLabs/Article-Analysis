KOLKATA: No bikers will be allowed on the new Garden Reach flyover after 6pm. The police took the decision after two youths on a motorcycle, speeding on the elevated corridor, lost control of the bike and dashed into the guard rail, injuring themselves grievously. The two are being treated at SSKM Hospital. 

 While an investing officer said after hitting the wall,   (21) and   (20) fell to the ground and got dragged by the bike for a little distance, residents of the area and a police patrol team claimed the two got thrown off the flyover onto the road below. "It was around 9.20pm on Sunday. The biker was speeding beyond all permissible limits. What probably saved their lives were the helmets they were wearing," said an officer, adding the deserted flyover had turned into bikers' favourite speeding ground. So, the decision to bar bikers on the bridge after sundown. But the plan has raised questions about the viability of the flyover, given that trucks and buses are not allowed on it and now, only a handful of cars will use it at night. 
 
 The police said Alam and Siddiqui wanted to take a spin on the brand new bike, which was yet to be registered.What they had not accounted for were the sharp curves on the flyover. "When they reached the Paharpur Cooling Towers, they hit the guard wall and slumped on the road and got dragged," said an officer. But some loacls and a police patrol team claimed the impact was such that the youths were thrown off the flyover and onto the road below. "The helmets saved them. But their condition is serious," said  , a biker crossing the flyover at that time. A case has been filed at the   police station.
