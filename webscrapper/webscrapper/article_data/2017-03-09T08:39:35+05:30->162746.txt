 He said the present government was looking for ways to regularise them.
 
 Ravi further said that the Congress had procured votes on this pretext but after coming to power neither any policy was framed for them, nor the roster was implemented. To this Virbhadra replied that they should wait for the budget. "We are committed to the welfare of people and cannot allow people to remain on contract for the entire service," he added.
 
 On this, Ravi questioned him whether the government had followed the roster system and why it was not implemented. The latter said the government functioned according to rules and regulations and its every action was challengeable. Following this, there were uproarious scenes inside the house. Hans Raj said that people were suffering because of non-implementation of roster system. BJP legislators also alleged that the government appointed PTA, PAT and SMC teachers on pick-and-choose basis.
 
 Not satisfied with the reply of Virbhadra, opposition then walked out of the house.
