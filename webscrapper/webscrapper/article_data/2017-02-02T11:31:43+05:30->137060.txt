BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh   have hailed the announcements made in the Union Budget, but at the same time felt that implementation of these measures will be crucial and a lot will depend on it.

 The government has set a target of agricultural loan disbursement worth Rs 10,000 crore for this financial year and at the same time increased the corpus of National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) for its long-term irrigation fund to Rs 40,000 crore. Experts associated with the rural finance in the state say that this could have a long-term impact on the overall economy of the state. “Better irrigation means betterment of rural economy, increasing investment in irrigation will definitely have a positive impact on the economy. As far as increasing the agricultural credit disbursement target is concerned it always has a good impact, as more funds to farmers means more investment in agriculture, leading to better production,” said a senior official of a leading bank.
 
 Farmer leaders though welcomed the announcements, but also raised questions on various other issues that remained untouched. “The BJP manifesto promised farmers a rate against their produce that will be at least 50% above their production cost, but the government has again remained silent on the issue. The plight of farmers will not improve until and unless they get fair prices for their agricultural produce,” farmer leader, Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji told TOI. “Overall the budget seems farmer-friendly, as there has been allocation of funds to address almost all the sectors touching their lives. Be it irrigation, crop insurance, or agricultural credit, but it is the implementation of these schemes that will decide the fate of these measures,” said Shivkant Dixit, farmer leader associated with the   (BKS).
