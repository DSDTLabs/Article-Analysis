 We decided not to carry out the drive against non-ISI helmets. But we’ll continue to create awareness on using helmets which meet safety standards,” he added.
 
 The Bureau of Indian Standards told police that when a licence is granted to the manufacturer, the latter has to follow the testing procedure as per police’s testing and inspection documents. “Helmets conforming to the requirements are marked with the standard sign. Hence, BIS conformity cannot be verified through visual examination,” a source said.
 
 Traffic policemen, too, are relieved. A traffic police officer said they are wary of stopping two-wheelers for using substandard helmets. “Given the number of two-wheelers in Bengaluru, a drive could lead only to angry exchanges. In terms of logistics, there’s no way to verify if the   mark is genuine. If we need to prove a helmet is substandard, we’ll have to take the helmet to a laboratory and subject it to a  . Who will bear the cost,” he said.
