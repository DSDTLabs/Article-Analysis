 General secretary of PGI's Nurses' Association, Sujan Singh said, "The open dump around Type 1 residences on the campus is heaped with medical waste from infected patients and is freely accessible to animals who spread the infection further, leading to various diseases."
 
 The administration refuted all allegations saying swine flu patients were responsible for spreading infection. "The institute cannot control movement of large number of patients it receives everyday," said SGPGI director Prof Rakesh Kapoor. He added that around 1,200 vials of swine flu vaccine had been purchased and were first being administered to employees working in swine flu wards. "Advisories have been pasted everywhere on the campus. Medical professionals are well aware of the precautions. On Monday, more posters will be put up."
