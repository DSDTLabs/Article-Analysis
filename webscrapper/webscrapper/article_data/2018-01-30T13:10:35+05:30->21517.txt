Nagpur: If work on constructing a beach in over 350-year-old historic Navegaon Lake bed stirred up a row, Gondia guardian minister Rajkumar Badole performed bhoomipujan of a garden on forest land in Navegaon in the same area.

 No   was obtained by the authorities from the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra ( ) to whom the land was handed over by the forest department in 2012.
 
 While handing over the said land, the state government on January 24, 2012 had made it clear that no new constructions should come up on the land which is being transferred to FDCM.
 
 However, on January 21, Badole on the invitation of local NGO   laid stone for a Balodyan (garden) in around one hectare land. The NGO is not a registered entity.
 
 Vijay Doye, president of Navegaon Foundation, says though our NGO is not registered our intentions are to boost tourism in the area which FDCM and wildlife wing failed to do for years together.
 
 Doye says the said land belongs to the revenue department and instead of NOC being sought from the FDCM, forest department should have taken NOC from the   before handing it over to the commercial corporation. “Our NGO’s aim is to promote ecotourism and pass on benefits to the locals,” he added.
 
 However, FDCM’s Gondia divisional manager (DM) PG Nawkharkar admits the land in question belongs to FDCM and no official permission has been taken from us to develop the garden.
 
 “It is a mutual understanding as no new structures will come up on the said land and only old and obsolete toys will be replaced and renovation is being planned,” said Nawkharkar.
 
 The Rs30 lakh garden project includes Rs15 lakh for developing Balodhyan and Rs15 lakh for installing solar lights and protection hut for a chowkidar in front of the garden.
 
 Badole did not respond to the calls but sources close to him said all the works are sanctioned and are being implemented under district tourism promotion committee.
