BENGALURU: A two-month old girl died after food got   on Wednesday morning at   near Magadi in   district.

 The infant was the first child of Manjunath, a farmer, and  , residents of Karenahalli. The baby choked on the ragi malt that was fed to her as a substitute for breast milk.
 
 According to police sources, thefamily was ignorant about infant feeding practices and was advisedby their relatives to feed ragi malt. The baby would vomit the malt, every time it was fed. On Wednesday morning, the child was found struggling after the malt got stuck in her throat. The infant was rushed to the taluk government hospital in Magadi, but in vain.
 
 Taluk hospital doctor   said babies can only digest other food items once they are sixmonths old. “Feeding malt before six months is dangerous; it’s better to feed cow milk as a substitute for breast milk. Dhanalakshmi’s baby died as ragi malt stuck in her throat blocked the respiratory system,” Dr Jnanaprakash said.
 
 Family sources said Dhanalakshmi had suffered two miscarriages before giving birth to this baby.
 
 According to Dr Ranjan Pejaver, a city-based neonatologist, the baby may have died due to aspiration, which occurs when food in any form enters the airway or lungs. “Not just ragi, this could have happened with water or milk too. Resorting to formula milk should be discouraged,” he said.
