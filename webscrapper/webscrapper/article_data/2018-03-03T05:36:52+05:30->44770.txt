CHENNAI: As commuters eagerly look forward to the opening of  , another underground facility 3km away, is taking final shape.   metro station, located behind the Egmore railway station, is expected to open along with a part of Central Metro by April.

 “Work to get the station ready for opening is in the final stages. The station will open along with Central Metro,” a metro rail official said. 
 
 At present,   Limited officials are conducting trial runs in the 4km stretch between Central Metro and   via Egmore Metro. Once open, it will connect Central Metro to   and airport via   and Alandur.
 
 Egmore metro will be a convenient interchange for passengers stepping out of Egmore railway station and heading to either ends of the Poonamallee High Road. They can exit Egmore railway station through the two ramps on Poonamallee High Road, walk to the metro station’s entry point built right next to it and board a train to Central Metro, Koyambedu or airport. The metro station does not have an entry point on the opposite side of Egmore railway station on Poonamallee High Road and commuters have to cross the road to reach the station.
 
 “Egmore metro station is built under the parking and the bus stop of Egmore railway station and not directly under Poonamallee High Road. So it was difficult to provide an entry point opposite Egmore railway station,” a metro rail official said.
 
 Egmore metro will cater to both passengers arriving from southern of   at the Egmore railway station as well as those reaching the station through suburban trains. That apart, the underground station will serve residents of surrounding localities including Vepery, Purasaiwalkam, Periyamet, Pudupet and Chintadripet.
