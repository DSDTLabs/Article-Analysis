 Sandalwood’s Film Industry for Rights and Equality (FIRE), the brainchild of actor-writer  , is all set to begin the Barahagarara Balaga (Screenwriters’ Association). A team, which comprised Chetan, lyricist-filmmaker Kaviraj and writer Anandapriya, visited their counterparts in Mumbai to understand their ways of functioning and modalities.
  “I’ve always believed that the real makers and shapers of any entertainment industry are from the creative side. If writers struggle, it will end up adversely affecting the film industry. It is very important to secure them for the upliftment of the film industry. This organization plans to assist them with script registration and legal protection in terms of copyright. It has been proven that those marginalized in any space can make a difference by joining hands, when they have the law by their side,” says Chetan.
  The team was in Mumbai on Thursday and spoke to the Screenwriters’ Association there. “We’ve found a lot of important points that needs to be put in action. The most important thing is to understand the difference between authorship and ownership of scripts and even when writers are commissioned by producers to write a story, they have certain privileges,” says Chetan.
  FIRE plans on getting together the association for Sandalwood shortly and are getting legal experts and help from their Mumbai counterparts to get everything in order. “We have the help of both the veterans and the youngsters. If the two join hands, then there is a collective force to help everyone realize the worth of writers,” says Chetan, who adds that names like  , V Nagendra Prasad,  , Giriraj, Jayathirtha, V Manohar and   are among the few that he has been in touch with and have expressed their interest in having a screenwriters’ association for the   film industry.
