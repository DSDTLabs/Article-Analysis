CHENNAI: The Madras high court has refused to stay recovery proceedings initiated by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) against   – the company handling   projects – saying constitutional courts could not usurp the powers of the competent authorities in the absence of any legally acceptable reason. It would paralyse the quasi-judicial functions of the competent authorities, observed Justice S M   while disposing of a plea moved by Gammon assailing summons issued by the regional commissioner, EPFO, Chennai, dated March 11, 2015.

 When the plea came up for hearing on May 3, the judge said, “What is challenged in the petition is only a summons issued to the company to appear for an enquiry. It is mandatory on the part of petitioners to appear before the authorities and defend their cases in accordance with the procedures as contemplated under the act and rules. Contrarily, they have moved this writ petition challenging the very notice issued by the competent authorities and therefore, this writ petition is not maintainable and should be rejected in limine.”
 
 The issue pertains to payment of provident fund contribution by the company for all its eligible employees. The writ petitioner is regularly paying the contribution in respect of all its eligible employees.
 
 According to the petitioner-company, in terms of EPF scheme, contribution is liable to be paid only on basic pay, dearness allowance, cash value of food concessions and retaining allowances, if any.
 
 The dispute arose when the EPFO demanded that the contribution should be based on all the allowances, including conveyance allowance, special allowance, ad hoc allowance, chilling allowance, stipend, LTA, medical, dress reimbursement, cold room shift allowance, attendance incentive and meals allowances, paid by the company.
 
 The matter is now pending before the   which passed interim orders saying that the PF commissioner may proceed to make the assessment but not raise any demand.
