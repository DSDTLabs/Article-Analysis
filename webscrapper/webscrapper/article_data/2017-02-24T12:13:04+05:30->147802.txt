AMRAVATI:   will once again be ruled by the  . Winning 27 seats out of 59,   has proved that in rural belts it is still a force to reckon with. Having emerged as the single largest party, Congress is all set to form its government with the support of allies. Bereft of any big political leader, the success recorded by the Congress is noteworthy.

 In the 59-member house, Congress got 27 seats, BJP 14,   5, Shiv Sena 2, Prahar 4,   and RPI (A) one each. At five places, other candidates posted victories.
 
 Teosa and Dhamangaon belts, represented in the assembly by Congress MLAs Yashomati Thakur and Virendra Jagtap, recorded remarkable victories for Congress while Congress district president Bablu Deshmukh was elected from Ghatladki. Congress won all four seats from Dhamangaon taluka, including Priyanka Dagarkar (Deogaon) and Suresh Nimkar (Mangrul Dastgir). Congress won two of the four seats from Nandgaon Khandeshwar taluka through Anita Admate and Jayashri Kohchad while one was pocketed by BSP’s Suhasini Dhepe and the other by BJP’s Ravindra Mundre.
 
 In Melghat, NCP fared well. Of the five seats, it won three while Congress got two. Mahendra Galwal and Vanita Pal of Congress won from Harisal and Gondwadi while Maya Malviya, Seema Gadge and Sarla Mavaskar of NCP won from Diya, Mogda and Ranigaon respectively.
 
 In Morshi, Congress, BJP and NCP had mixed fortunes while in Warud BJP could not get expected success.
 
 Among the victorious were Pratap Abhyankar (Dhamangaon Gadhi) who posted his third win, despite quitting RPI and joining BJP. Balasaheb Hingankar, who quit Shiv Sena and joined Congress, too won. Yuva Swabhiman Party of MLA Ravi Rana also got two seats.
 
 Among those who lost are chairman Girish Karale, former ZP vice president Jaiprakash Patel, former ZP chairperson Ushatai Watane and Shiv Sena’s Balasaheb Bhagwat.
