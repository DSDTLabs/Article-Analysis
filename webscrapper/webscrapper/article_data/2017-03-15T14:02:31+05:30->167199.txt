KOLKATA: The story of Nil Battey Sannata, a film in which a mother who works as a maid joins her daughter in writing the school exams, seems to have crossed over from celluloid into real life.

 Biplab Mondal, a class 12 student at   in West Bengal's Ranaghat, appeared for the   examination with his parents.
 
 Biplab's father Balaram is a 43-year-old farmer and his mother Kalyani is a 33-year-old homemaker. For the last few years, the family of three has been diligently preparing for the Higher Secodary exams, with Biplab playing teacher to his parents.
 
 "I taught my parents. They are weak in English, so one of our neighbours tutored them in the subject," said Biplab.
 
 Balaram and his wife Kalyani cleared the   exam in 2014 and 2015 respectively, before enrolling in Arongghata Hajrapur School. But they say it was not an easy process. 
 
 "When our son cleared Madhyamik, we decided to sit in Higher Secondary exam with our son. As we were old, many schools refused to admit us. Finally, we got admission in Arongghata Hajrapur School," Balaram said.
 
 The headmaster at the school said he was impressed to see Biplab's parents so dedicated to their education, and made sure to pay special attention to them.
 
 Local MLA Samir Poddar said, "Those who were forced to leave education can be inspired by this family. If anyone wants to read we are always there to help them."
 
 Biplab's mother Kalyani said the family got a cycle from the school under the government's Sabuj Sathi scheme.
 
 "The three of us went to school together four days a week. Some people made fun of us, but we never took their remarks seriously," Kalyani added.
 
 Balaram said that he has many educated relatives, and some of them are college professors. But they avoid him and his family because they are lacking in a formal education.
 
 "They don't even keep in touch with us. So I want to show them what we are capable of," Balaram said.
