ROORKEE: A doctor has been caught red-handed by Haridwar district administration while conducting a sex-determination test. Dr   who runs Pappu Nursing home in Laksar was taken into police custody on Saturday. A case under section 315 (prevent child being born) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against him on Sunday.
 
  Police have also seized the ultrasound machine and other medical gadgets from the nursing home.
  
  According to reports, the district administration team at the behest of district magistrate   raided the facility on Saturday after laying a trap to nab the owner. The raid followed complaints that Agarwal, an Ayurvedacharya by qualification, was involved in illegal sex-determination and abortion.
  
  A team comprising the joint magistrate, Haridwar, the additional chief medical officer (ACMO) and the sub-divisional magistrate, Laksar, had sent a woman posing as a customer to the nursing home where Agarwal demanded Rs 20,000 from her to conduct a sex-determination test and abortion if required. As the raid was in progress, the accused doctor called his supporters at the nursing home which compelled police to deploy extra force. The nursing home was inspected for over five hours.
  
  “On the complaint of ACMO Dr H D Shakya, a case has been registered against Agarwal under section 315 of the IPC,” said SDM, Laksar, Kaustubh Mishra.
  
  “We produced the accused doctor before a magistrate on Sunday who has sent him to 14-day judicial custody,” said T S Rana, station house officer of Laksar Kotwali.
