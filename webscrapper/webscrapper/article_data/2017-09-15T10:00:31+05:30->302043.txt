BENGALURU: A 35-year-old private firm employee has been allegedly cheated of her 2008 model   (UP 32 CM 6132) by a fake firm which she had contacted online for shifting the vehicle to her hometown.

 In her complaint filed with Malleswaram police last week, Lalita Das, who is from Lucknow, said she was also duped of Rs 10,000, which she had paid as advance transportation charges.
 
 Police said Lalita, a resident of 18th Cross, Malleswaram, decided to send her car back to Lucknow and searched for packers and movers online. She came across a cellphone number, which was said to belong to   located in Vemna Layout, Yelahanka Main Road. She contacted the number and a person identified as Vishwanath S Koti agreed to shift her car.She paid Rs 10,000 as advance through netbanking on June 30.
 
 “A few days later, two persons visited her residence and drove away her car. But it never reached Lucknow. So Lalita tried to contact Koti on his mobile, which was switched off. After repeated efforts to contact him failed, she rushed to the office address he had provided her and found there was no sign of any such company .She realized she had been conned and approached police to file a complaint,“ a police officer said.
 
 Malleswaram police said they have taken up a case of cheating under IPC section 420 and are investigating. `The woman doesn't have enough details about the suspect except his mobile number and bank account. The phone has been switched off for several days now. We are focusing on the bank account to which she transferred money . It may lead us to the culprits,“ a cop said.
