ROHTAK: Trashing the decision of a khap mahapanchayat in Sonipat to defer the call for January 29 Jat stir in the state, another mahapanchayat of prominent khaps at Nandal Bhawan on Friday reiterated their decision to hold the peaceful agitation at its scheduled time.

 A khap mahapanchayat held in Sonipat on January 25 had announced not to participate in the stir called by Jat leader   in support of reservation for the community.
 
 Om  , new chief of Nandal khap who was the convener of Friday’s mahapanchayat here, said, “Our stir will be peaceful and if it strays, we will back out. Since the reservation matter is in high court, we will wait for it. This time agitation is for releasing the innocent youths languishing in jail for the past several months.”
 
 “We are not with those who are culprits, but there are several youths who were picked up police based on video clips. As the clips could be doctored, police and court should rely on scientific investigation proofs and release those who are not guilty,” he said.
 
 Rohtak deputy commissioner   imposed Section 144 of CrPC in the district, highways and rail tracks, restricting assembly of five or more than five persons at these places.
