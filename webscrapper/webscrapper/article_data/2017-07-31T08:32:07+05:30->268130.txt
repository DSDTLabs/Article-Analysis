LUCKNOW: Police arrested 19 persons after two groups set vehicles afire and vandalised public property during a clash in a   village on Sunday afternoon. 

 In the morning, a committee which takes care of a local mazaar (shrine) was organising auction of a pond in   village. A man who had been allowed to catch fish in the pond for a year was asked for some money in return by the the committee. A section of the villagers, however, were opposed to this.  , a local resident reached the spot with scores of people. The other side was represented by Arshad and Masood. The three men were active during panchayat elections and belong to rival camps. 
 
 The matter soon took an ugly turn and both sides indulged in heavy stone-pelting. The mob set at least six motorcycles afire and damaged a dozen other vehicles. An FIR was later lodged against both the sides and those seen pelting stones were detained. Police force has been deployed in the area.
 
 SSP  , who visited the spot, said a report would be sought from the local tehsil office to check the status of the pond and to find out whether it can be leased out or auctioned by the committee.
