Mapusa: Deaths of nearly seven monkeys along the Goa-Maharashtra border near Patradevi have raised fear and anxiety in the minds of the locals about the spread of Kyasanur Forest Disease ( ).

 A source said that in the bordering villages of Torsem and Mopa, 6-7 monkeys have been found dead. 
 
 Local MLA and forest minister Rajendra Arlekar along with officials of the forest and health department inspected the areas on Thursday.
 
 “Without taking any risk, we have ordered the vaccination of the locals as a precautionary measure. It is yet to be established whether it is KFD. We have done the inspection of the dead bodies of the monkeys and have sent for biopsy, the reports of which are likely to be out in five days,” local MLA and forest minister Rajendra Arlekar, who had inspected the area, said.
 
 “We have also asked all the government officials, who are involved in the inspection of the dead bodies of the monkeys, to take the vaccination,” he said.
 
 Locals said that the moneys have travelled to Patradevi (bordering Goa) from the forest areas of Banda in Maharashtra.
 
 “We have also alerted the forest officials from Maharashtra to take necessary steps,” Arlekar said.
 
 Arlekar also said that there has not been any case of KFD reported and people need not panic.
