NEW DELHI: Reliance   on Tuesday has accused   of "flagrant misuse" of M&A provisions in its proposed acquisition of 4G spectrum and sites of   Networks. Jio, which has been at loggerheads with   since its launch in September last year, alleged that Airtel was circumventing M&A norms with an "intention to cause loss of revenue to the government exchequer" to the tune of over Rs 217 crore.

 It has sought a deferment of the proposed   transaction.
 
 "We bring to your attention that the scheme of merger... indicates `flagrant misuse' of provisions of M&A guidelines," Jio said in a letter to the telecom ministry .
 
 A spokesperson for Airtel denied the allegation. "Bharti Airtel has always been and will continue to be fully compliant with all regulatory guidelines. We strongly deny these allegations, which is yet another mischievous attempt to throttleblock competition." Airtel had announced the Rs 1,600-crore deal in late March, giving it access to Tikona's 20-MHz spectrum (in 2,300-MHz band) in Gujarat, UP (East), UP (West), Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh circles.
 
 Jio claimed that to use the acquired spectrum, Airtel needs to pay money to the government to migrate   to unified licence (UL) against the ISP (internet service provider) licence it currently holds. The UL licence would allow the company to offer voice services over Tikona's spectrum.
 
 "Any circumvention of this principle, in whichever form, including through misuse of M&A guidelines, will lead to loss of revenue for government exchequer and must be prevented," Jio said, adding that it had itself paid Rs 1,658 crore in 2013 for a similar migration of its spectrum holdings. "We submit that in case the acquisition of Tikona is permitted... the government stands to lose in excess of Rs 217 crore."
