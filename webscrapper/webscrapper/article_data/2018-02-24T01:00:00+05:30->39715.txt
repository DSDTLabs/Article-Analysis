An upcoming romantic comedy, 'Veerey Ki Wedding', starring Pulkit Samrat, Kriti Kharbanda and Jimmy Shergill, Yuvika Choudhary and  , has three songs (at the time of going to print). And that is a tad surprising, considering that it has tremendous scope for impromptu songs like Bollywood movies of this genre (romance, wedding etc) usually have. 
 
 The very done-to-death soundscape and have-heard-that-before beats of the first track, 'Mind Blowing', composed by Farzan Faaiz, invariably reminds you of a typical Salman Khan song. And that is its sole claim to fame. However, Mika Singh’s rendition of this cheeky dance number in his classic tapori style is applaud-worthy. 
 
 Lyricists Deepak Noor-Chandan Bakshi, have tried to get a youthful vibe to the song with their use of words.
 
 The next song ' ' has Sunidhi Chauhan’s full- throated voice singing the old Haryanvi track with the same name. She is in full form and seems to be enjoying the song composed by  . Interestingly, there are three lyricists in this one song, despite it only being a remake.
 
 The title track 'Veerey Ki Wedding', sung by  , is a complete wedding song, and with it’s typical Punjabi beats this one will urge you to get up an join the dancers.
