Keri: A panchanama conducted by the Pernem range forest officer has revealed that over 2,918 trees were felled in the vicinity of the   area at Latambarcem.

 Vadawal resident Pradip Rane has confessed before the sub-divisional forest officer of Mapusa, Shrikrishna Prabhu, that he had felled the trees for carrying out agricultural activities and plantation of fruit growing trees.
 
 It took almost five days for Pernem forest officials to locate all the trees that were felled in the area. Vilas Gawas, range forest officer of Pernem, said, “We have completed the panchanama of all the felled trees. Earlier, Rane was arrested under Goa Preservation of Tree Act and has been called at the Pernem range office on February 27 to submit his statements in the matter on the affidavit.”
 
 A major catchment area of the Amthane dam falls within the private properties owned by the Rane family, among others. The felled trees were lying very close to the reservoir of the Amthane dam. Madhu Gaonkar, a social activist from Khandola, who visited the deforested area of Latambarcem, said, “Such activities can take place as there is no legal protection given to the catchment area of the Amthane dam, thereby affecting the water retaining capacity of the dam and also causing soil erosion. The water resources department (WRD) should look into the matter seriously and plan a strategy for identifying the area as ecologically sensitive and this should have legal protection.”
 
 WRD superintendent engineer Shrikant Patil said, “I came to know about the deforestation through newspaper reports. I will bring it to the notice of the officer of minor irrigation so that corrective measures are adopted.”
 
 Sub-divisional forest officer Shrikrishna Prabhu said, “We are in the process of filing a detailed report. Stringent action will be taken against offenders .”
