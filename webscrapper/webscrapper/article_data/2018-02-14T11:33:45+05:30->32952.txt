HYDERABAD: A rule under the Central Motor Vehicle (MV) Act, which mandates an applicant to have passed class 8 for him/her to be eligible to obtain a ‘driver’s badge’—which is necessary in order to operate a light motor vehicle — has irked many auto drivers in Hyderabad.

 In the latest development, auto drivers, under the   (TADS) banner, have sent a postcard to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to make amendments to this rule. According to A Sathi  , general secretary, TADS, more than 40 per cent of the auto drivers have not cleared class 8.
 
 “It is an immediate request that this rule be relaxed since more than 40 per cent of the auto drivers who are currently operating in the twin cities are not eligible to get a driver’s badge as per the rule. Also, according to norms, it is only one year after a license has been issued that one can apply for a drivers’ badge. As a result, many buy autos and start plying in the city, unaware of such rules. Many drivers turn to this profession after working as daily wage labourers and this rule makes them all ineligible to take up an auto driver’s job,” said Reddy.
 
 Auto drivers allege that each time they are caught driving without a badge, either by traffic cops or by   ( ) officials, they are forced to cough up a steep fine anywhere between ₹1,000 and ₹1,500.
 
 “Every time we are caught without the driver’s badge, traffic cops file a case alleging us of riding without a driver’s license and we are forced to pay hefty fines. I do not have any formal education and before this I was working as a labourer in  ,” said an auto driver who did not want to be named.
 
 Sources said that TADS members from other districts of   are likely to send their representations to the PM soon, requesting him to relax this rule.
 
 Transport department authorities, however, argue the necessity of the rule and maintain that it ensures that drivers have the basic reading and comprehensive abilities.
