AGARTALA: Anxiety and uncertainty ruled the streets of   the night before counting of votes began on Saturday. The discussions were beyond ‘chalo paltai’. There were misgivings as voters pondered over whether they had done the right thing in seeking ‘paribartan’ (revolution).

 Had the saffron party delivered in   in the two years it has been in power? The questions persisted. Hours later, the second biggest city in the north-east after Guwahati wore a deserted look. Shutters were down, no public transport was plying, and none of the street-corner debaters of the night before were to be seen.
 
 Fearing that   cadre would take the city by storm if the Left Front won, state police in riot gear were deployed at vantage points. “We don’t want trouble. We don’t want people to celebrate the victory by causing disturbance. We have taken all possible measures to prevent it,” an officer of the West   police station said.
 
 A BJP spokesperson had said on Friday night, “If they (CPM) win tomorrow, they won’t be able to take out a victory rally because the party is in three-day mourning (following the death of party candidate  ).”
 
 But soon after counting started at 8am and early trends emerged, there was a dramatic change. The trickle of BJP supporters at counting centres became a surge. The air was filled with cries of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ as youth on motorcycles waving BJP flags swarmed the city. The writing on the wall was clear — the red bastion had fallen. All roads leading to the BJP headquarters at Krishna Nagar were clogged with supporters and fleets of vehicles. BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, state president and probable chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, BJP observer   and Himanta Biswa Sarma struggled to push their way through the crowd when they came out of the party office.
 
 In contrast, red seemed to have vanished.
 
 No Left supporter could be seen, and the CPM party office had only security guards standing tall.
