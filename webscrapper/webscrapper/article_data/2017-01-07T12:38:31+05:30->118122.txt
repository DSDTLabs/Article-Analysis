Had it not been for intervention from the Delhi High Court and some spectacular back-tracking from   (AIFF) on   SC, Goa would have had no representation in I-League for the first time in the 20-year history of the league.
 
  Since the National Football League was launched in 1996, Goa has been the best-represented state with anywhere between two to six teams from the state featuring in the league every year. It all started with Churchill Brothers, Dempo Sports Club and   qualifying for the inaugural edition in 1996-97 and reached an all-time high in 2004-05 when six Goan teams – Churchill Brothers, Salgaocar, Dempo, Vasco SC, Fransa-Pax and   -- were part of the 12-team league, with Dempo winning the first of their five league titles.
  
  This season, Dempo fought their way back from the second division to join Salgaocar FC and Sporting Clube at the top, only for all three Goan clubs to decide it was pointless continuing.
  
  “Many of the club owners in Goa have been foolishly passionate and that's why we have kept on investing so much money into Indian football. There is a point in time when, as a company or individual, you have to decide at what point you will stop being foolishly passionate. The roadmap is not clear,” said Dempo SC president  .
  
  The return of Churchill Brothers, meanwhile, surprised many.
  
  After all, the AIFF had made it clear that teams who do not fulfil the club licensing criteria has no place in I-League but when Churchill’s fourth writ petition came up for discussion in the Delhi High Court, AIFF hardly put up a fight. In fact, they were more than willing to “consider” Churchill’s request, paving the way for their return following strong backing from its president Praful Patel, who recently admitted Churchill Alemao in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) fold
