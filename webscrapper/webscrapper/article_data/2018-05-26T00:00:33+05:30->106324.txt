Challenging Star Darshan is all set to feature in a video about the importance of protecting trees, which will be released ahead of World Environment Day on June 5. The actor had been part of another video that was released in March by the Karnataka Forest Department, in which he had spoken about the need to protect wildlife and flora and fauna of forest areas from forest fires during the summer.
 
  Speaking to us, Deputy Conservator of Forest, V Yedukondalu, says, “Since Darshan is a popular actor, we roped him in to spread a message on environmental health issues caused by massive destruction of trees. In the next video, he will speak about the importance of planting trees to protect mother earth, which is our motto as part of World Environment Day. He will also speak on the need to increase the green cover by planting and protecting trees to keep global warming under check. The video is being shot at Bandipur, Nagarahole and   region.”
