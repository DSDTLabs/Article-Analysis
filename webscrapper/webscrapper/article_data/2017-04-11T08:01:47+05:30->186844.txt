CHENNAI: Hundreds of people in the city were left high and dry on Monday as most  . People were forced to queue up in bank branches to withdraw money using cheques.

 “I went to five ATM booths across the city and all were closed as   was available,“ said Elango Xavier, a car dealer.
 
 V Balasubramanian, president, ATM & Transaction Services, FSS, said, “We are getting less currency from the banks and with this being the salary period, the ATMs are getting exhausted. But things would get better in the next few days.“ He said on a normal day each ATM is loaded with Rs20 lakh-RsRs40 lakh but on Monday it was down to Rs15 lakh.
 
 “There has been a shortage of cash in the last few days as we have been getting only 10%-15% of our requirement from the RBI,“ said a bank official. Bankers attributed the shortage to a rise in cash dealings, non-supply of the Rs2,000 notes, and a big demand for cash during the salary week. An ATM network operator agreed that there was a shortage of cash, saying that the year-end salary withdrawals had affected the cash flow. “Last year too, we faced a similar situation in April but were able to tide it over as we had adequate cash reserves,“ he said.
 
 “Currently, we are supplying cash on a day-to-day basis and the lack of reserves has precipitated this situation. It has been particularly acute in the last two days,“ the operator said.   officials in Chennai said that their currency chest had received only 65% of the cash requirement.
