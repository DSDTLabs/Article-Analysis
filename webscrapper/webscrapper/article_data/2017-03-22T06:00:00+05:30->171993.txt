KOLKATA: With the ministry of defence (MoD) granting physical possession of land in Esplanade to  , tunneling up to Sealdah for the second phase of the East-West   corridor can start by the end of 2017. The interim period will be utilised to bring the tunnel boring machine (TBM) to the spot within Curzon Park and make preparations to lower it 45 metres below the surface.

 Though the MoD had agreed on principle to allow   Ltd (KMRCL) to use the plot it owns in Esplanade for the station, it took months for physical possession to be handed over. Metro Railway general M C Chauhan, who is also the   chairman, held several parleys with the MoD before the permission finally arrived on Monday evening.
 
 “The TBM weighs 250 tonnes and will have to be brought to Esplanade from   in parts. This will take nearly a month. A vertical shaft of 45 metres will then have to be dug to retain the earth. This is deeper than the shaft in Howrah (where tunneling is already underway) as the TBM has to pass below the existing north-south tunnel. A 20x30 metre concrete ‘diaphragm’ wall will also have to be constructed to protect the shaft. This will take nearly four months. The TBM can be lowered only after all this,” said Indrani Banerjee, CPRO, Metro Railway.
 
 The TBM will be lowered in parts and then assembled. This will also take three-four months before the machine can be tested. Before long, the Rani Rashmoni Gate of Curzon Park (next to Rani Rashmoni’s statue) will be shut to facilitate work. The distance between Esplanade and Sealdah is 2.6km and officials plan to complete the tunnel as soon as possible.
 
 Unless the tunneling is completed and the TBM emerges from Sealdah, the station can’t be commissioned though the link from Salt Lake Sector-V in the first phase will be completed by June, 2018. Though originally planned till Sealdah, phase I of the E-W Corridor will end at Phoolbagan.
