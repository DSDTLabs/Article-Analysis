  : The   (NIT) will debut with the launch of a   to meet expenses on   from this year. The idea will be launched later this month, when the institute will host the homecoming of over 300   on January 28 and 29 at the college campus. Over 70 top executives of leading public and private sector companies, including 50 alumni from  , are expected to attend the event. 

 "It would not be prudent to figure out how much funds we will generate in the debut year but I am sure, several of our former students, who are holding top positions in government organizations and MNCs will generously contribute for the cause of the institute and the students," Priyanshu Kedia, head, Alumni Cell, NIT, said on Thursday. Kedia added that infrastructure work like constructing guest houses and an auditorium, a long pending issue with the college, would be completed with the help of the non-endowment fund. "At present, we have the endowment fund facility meant for big budget projects. It involves funds in crores and the process for seeking approval for the utilisation of the same is time consuming (since the Board of Governors takes a final call on the approval of the utilization of the endowment fund)," Kedia said.The alumni member further explained that the non-endowment fund utilization will be relatively easy as the dean (Industry and Industrial Relations) will be the authority for approval. "Often, we need small funds to support the new engineering ideas of the students keen on developing fresh models and in this context, the non-endowment fund will come handy," Kedia said. Kedia also said that several former NIT students, who hold top positions in different organizations will be requested to channelize the CSR funds to the now-endowment fund.
