Jaipur: Commuters banking on private cabs in the city will have a hard time as around 10,000 Ola and Uber cabs will go off road from Saturday midnight till indefinite period to pursue various demands including PF and ESI for drivers. 

 “There is no security for drivers. A few months ago a private cab driver was shot by a customer and no compensation was paid to him by the company. After which we collected Rs 2.5 lakh and gave to his family. There is no parking facility in the city and the number of vehicles is increasing every day and we are fined by the traffic police. No rules and regulations are being followed,” said Ashish Singh, an office bearer of the employees union of Uber and Ola drivers.
 
 Their demands include installation of CCTV cameras in the cab for the security of drivers and customers, PF and ESI to all the employees, commissions to be cut from 25% to 10%, working hours be limited to nine hours. 
 
 Drivers also debate the policy of companies through which taxi-hailing companies have been given first priority to company-owned cars rather than driver-owned vehicles.
