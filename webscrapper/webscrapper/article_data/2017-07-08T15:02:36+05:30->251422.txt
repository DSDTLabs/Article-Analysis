VISAKHAPANAM: The Supreme Court’s order to stop counselling and admission processes at all IITs till further notice has left several students and coaching centre managements in and around the city confused.

 The SC passed the order on Friday in response to a petition filed by an aspirant   on June 30. The apex court sought a response from the central government which had asked for quashing of IIT Joint Entrance Examination-2017 rank list and awarding of additional marks to all candidates who had appeared in the test. 
 
 The petitioner urged SC to declare that awarding of "bonus marks" to candidates who had appeared in the JEE (Advanced) 2017 examination violated her right and that of other students as well.
 
 Sadanand Moses, coordinator for the IIT programme in  , said that the decision will pose a lot of difficulties for the students, while B Suresh of Narayana-Chaitanya Institute said, “This year has been very unsettling for aspirants right from the beginning. One controversy after another. Hopefully the SC will give further directions as promised on Monday.”
 
 However, the managements feel that this judgement will not affect the top rankers. Students also reacted in a similar manner, even though some agreed with the SC judgement.
 
 “ When we got to know about the judgement we panicked. Now we will have to keep our fingers crossed and wait it out till further orders that will hopefully be announced on Monday,” said A Abhishek. However, another student K Ramprasad said, “ This is unfair. The board would not have awarded bonus marks unnecessarily. So many students will be affected by this decision.”
 
 Agreeing with the SC judgement,   said, “ I’m glad that the SC has passed such a judgement. Awarding bonus marks is not fair. Such a trend must be arrested.”
