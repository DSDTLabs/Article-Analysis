Mumbai: BEST administration’s plan to hire   buses on wet-lease has hit a hurdle after its committee members rejected the proposal on Thursday.

 In April, the transport undertaking had discontinued AC services on its 25 routes to cut down on the mounting losses. Instead, it had planned to have AC buses on wet-lease to tide over the demand for this category of travel. 
 
 BEST committee member Ravi Raja said, “This is indirect way of privatising BEST. It is not viable too.”
 
 Members felt that the administration will have to spend around Rs 150 crore for those buses. While the drivers will be provided by the private player, the conductor will belong to BEST, whose salary bill will have to be borne by BEST. Members also questioned the logic of hiring buses when BEST was reeling under the losses.
 
 Citing its poor financial performance, BEST administration also rejected the demand of some members to give Diwali bonus to employees.
