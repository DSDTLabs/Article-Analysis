NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister   is likely to hold three rallies in the capital ahead of the civic elections. Kumar’s JD(U) will, for the first time, contest all the 272 municipal seats.

 The party expects migrant labourers from Bihar and eastern UP to help it make decisive inroads into local politics. While party leaders admit that JD(U) does not have an organised network in the city on the lines of BJP or Congress, they claim to have built a solid network of volunteers and workers.
 
 Sanjay Jha, in charge of JD(U)’s Delhi poll campaign, said Kumar was a crowd-puller even in the capital. “Nitish Kumar’s rallies will be held in the first week of April,” Jha told TOI. By the end of March, most migrants who go home to celebrate Holi with their families are likely to be back in the city, said party sources. 
 
 In the rallies, Kumar aims to target his one-time ally in Delhi, CM  , who supported him in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections. JD(U) is trying to woo the same vote-bank — Poorvanchali voters — which AAP did in the 2015 assembly polls. 
 
 The party is drawing strength from the successful liquor ban imposed in Bihar and Kumar’s re-election in 2015 despite a Modi wave across the country. JD(U) has made liquor prohibition as one of its key poll promises in Delhi too.tnn
