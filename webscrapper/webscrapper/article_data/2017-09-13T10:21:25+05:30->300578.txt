Biker   is back with a bang. The Chennai racer gave a remarkable performance on the track and bagged the first position at the 4th round of National   Racing Championship 2017, held in the city. This is her first medal after a break of eight years on the racing circuit and she won the trophy beating 10 participants. On her momentous win,   says, “I was completely in tears. I won this trophy after eight years. There are certain feelings which you cannot explain; you just feel them.”

 Apart from racing,   is also busy with her all-women racing team, which has 20 members from across India. “Motorsports need good reflexes, which go down with age, so I want many more Alishas to represent India on the global platforms in the years to come,” she signs off.
