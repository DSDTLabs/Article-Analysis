ALAPPUZHA: An assistant sub-Inspector with the women’s cell has been placed under suspension after video clips of a transgender person, recorded while in police custody, got circulated on social media.   was suspended for recording the   with nudity in it and sharing it with another transgender person.   claimed that the transgender person who received the video, circulated it on social media platforms.

 A probe was launched by Alappuzha SP after the video clip allegedly recorded inside the Alappuzha South   went viral. The transgender person was taken into police custody on charges of creating a ruckus at a shop in Irumbupalam here on March 22.
 
 “The person was brought to the police station in an inebriated state. She declined to undergo medical examination and engaged in a scuffle with officers and stripped in the police station. She was let off without any offence being charged. In between, someone had recorded a video and circulated it,” said a police official.
 
 Police officials said that the special branch DSP is investigating the complaint.   in the city said it was wrong on part of the police to record a video like this.
 
 “The cops had contacted us after taking the transgender person into custody. A board member from the district transgender justice board also went to the police station but was attacked by the accused transgender person. She also attacked two women police officers as well. However, the police recording a video like this is highly condemnable,” said a transgender activist.
