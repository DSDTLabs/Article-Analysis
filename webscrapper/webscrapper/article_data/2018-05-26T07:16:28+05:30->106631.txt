 Pailan was at her home with her one-and-half-yearold child when the insect bit her on the middle finger of her right hand.

 The insect lying within the flowers, bit her with a severe sting. Amid severe pain,   managed to place the insect in a container and called her husband Bhaskar, who was then returning home from his workplace.
 
 “At first, I did not know what to do. My wife was in severe pain. I tried applying some medicines but Putul got no relief. I then called an auto and carried her to a nearby nursing home with our child in tow. Putul was admitted there under doctor  .”
 
 The doctor said: “The patient is still critical. Her right hand has turned pale and numb. Under the impact of severe pain, the patient’s blood pressure fell and her heart beat increased.

I will keep her under observation till Saturday and may discharge her on Sunday.”
