More than prejudices, it’s the patriarchal set up of our society that is posing a challenge. Aspiring actors still have to take permission from their parents, husbands or boyfriends before taking up a role on stage. It’s not just women, but also men, whose mindset needs to change. But the change has begun. It’s just a matter of time for things to become fully liberated. What we need are more   playwrights, narrating stories about women. It will also be good to see more women showing interest in costume, set and sound designing as well as handle lighting and similar tasks, and not just acting. And for that to happen, stagecraft should be introduced and taught to children right from the school level, together with skills development workshops and acting classes.
