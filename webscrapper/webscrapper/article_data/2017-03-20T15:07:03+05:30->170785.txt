PATNA: The   is likely to conduct trial run of   movement on the   before its rehabilitation works begin. The one-way traffic plan on the bridge was on hold for around a month owing to various issues, including absence of street lights on its parallel pontoon bridge, which was inaugurated by deputy chief minister   on February 18.
 
  “We are likely to go ahead with the trial of one-way traffic movement on the ‘setu’ as lights have been installed on the pontoon bridge. The date for the trial run is likely to be decided at a road construction department meeting on Monday. The trial is most likely to be conducted next weekend as per preliminary plans,” said Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal.
  
  Patna traffic SP P K Das said on Saturday that street lights had been installed on the pontoon bridge for vehicles movement even during night. He said additional deployment of home guards would be required on the pontoon bridge as well as the ‘setu’ to regulate one-way traffic.
  
  The 1.98km-long pontoon bridge has been constructed in the wake of upcoming rehabilitation works on the ‘setu’. Its existing superstructure is proposed to be completely demolished and triangular steel girders, as seen in rail-cum-road bridges like Rajendra Setu or Koilwar rail bridge, would be erected under the rehabilitation process. The project is targeted to be completed in 42 months utilizing an estimated outlay of Rs1,742.01 crore.
  
  The entire work has been divided into two phases — upstream and downstream. Sources said the work on upstream — Patna to Hajipur — would be taken up first and it is only after the commencement of vehicular movement on that stream, that work on the other stream would commence.
  
  “Alternative vehicular movement is extremely crucial during the setu rehabilitation works; hence, we want to ensure smooth traffic flow on the pontoon bridge before the works start,” said a senior road construction department official.
