 Police crushed the illicit liquor lobby in Surat and their biggest success was the arrest of notorious bootlegger Ramesh Patel alias Michael. Patel ran a successful illicit liquor business through his associates thanks to the political clout that he enjoyed. Police started collecting details about Patel after his name cropped up in a liquor consignment worth Rs80 lakh that was seized near Barbodhan in Surat. 
 
 He and his wife were arrested from Daman. Police exposed how Patel had earned his millions. Police investigation revealed that Patel had deposited a huge amount of money earned through bootlegging in his bank account. The enforcement directorate also registered a case of money laundering against him based on the findings of the police.
 
 Police did not spare families of political leaders either from Daman if they were found involved in bootlegging. Pramod Tandel, brother-in-law of Lalu Patel, BJP MP from Daman, was arrested. Police also initiated steps to attach properties of Tandel. They sealed a liquor shop which was registered in the name of the wife of Sukha Patel, president of Daman district panchayat, for allegedly selling liquor in Gujarat. Similar actions were taken against many other bootleggers operating from Daman who were evading arrests. 
 
 Exemplary action was taken against Prakash Patil, a millionaire cop. Patil, an assistant sub-inspector, was transferred to Dang and suspended for connivance with bootleggers. He was later arrested in a disproportionate assets case. Few other cops from local crime branch and special operation group of rural police were subjected to inquiries for conniving with bootleggers. Police in Navsari and Surat also arranged jobs for women bootleggers in industries to help them lead a respectful life.
