PUNE: The Hadapsar police busted a four-member gang for allegedly robbing cash and valuables of 16 people in Kothrud, Warje-Malwadi and   since March 15. 

 The spate of robberies were solved after one of the gang members, Chaitanya Todkar (29) from  , was arrested in a vehicle theft case on Friday. 
 
 Todkar’s interrogation led to the arrest of Shubham Kamble (19), of  , and accomplices Vijay Dedhe (19) and Omkar Wanjale (19), from Warje-Malwadi. It also led to the recovery of 16 smart phones, three two-wheelers and a camera, totally worth more than Rs 2 lakh, from the gang. 
 
 Assistant inspector Hemant Patil from the Hadapsar police station told TOI on Saturday, “The gang confessed to robbing 16 people of smart phones, cash and ornaments at secluded places by threatening them with sharp weapons. The money generated from the loot was spent on merry-making.” 
 
 “Three robbery complaints, including two in   and one at Alankar police station, have been registered. The process of identifying 13 other complaints for filing FIRs against the robbers is in progress,” Patil added. 
 
 Assistant inspector Sandeep Deshmane said, “We were investigating a vehicle theft and had received information that Todkar had parked a vehicle outside the residence of his friend in Hadapsar.” He added that Todkar’s arrest then led to the others in the case.
 
 The robbers were produced before the Pune cantonment court on Saturday in a vehicle theft case. The court remanded them in magisterial custody as the police had recovered the vehicle. Their custody was later transferred to the   police for taking action.
