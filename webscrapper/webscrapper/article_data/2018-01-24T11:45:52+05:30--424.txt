 rolled out   with   integration on its   in nine languages across 45 countries, including in India, on Wednesday.

 Like Apple's iBooks and Amazon-owned Audible, there is no monthly subscription fee required to purchase audiobooks. Users can experience their favourite literature read out to them by instructing Google Assistant, simply by saying "Ok Google, read my book".
 
 "We are rolling out Google audiobooks today, for users who prefer books to be read out to them. The Google Assistant integration with audiobooks is available on Android, iOS, Chromecast, Android Wear, Android Auto or even your laptop," said Greg Hartrell, Head of Product Management, Google Play Books.
 
 "On Google Play, you can buy a single audiobook at an affordable price, with no commitments. You can also get a free preview of the book to make sure you're hooked on to the story and enjoy listening to the narrator's voice," the company said in a statement.
 
 Try "Ok Google, who is the author?" if you need a refresher, or "Ok Google, stop playing in 20 minutes" to set a timer for bedtime reading, it added.
 
 As of now, the Google Assistant integration with audiobooks is available on Android smartphones and smart speakers globally in English.
 
 Audiobooks are generally priced between $7 and $15 but Google is offering discounts, in addition to 50 per cent off on your first audiobook, reports said.
