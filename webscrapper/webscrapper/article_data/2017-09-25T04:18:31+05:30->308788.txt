AMBALA:   police have released a list of over 20 persons who reportedly disappeared from the   premises. The list includes names of two people from Ambala.

 Sirsa SP Ashwin Shenvim on Friday constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the complaints of the kin of 20 people. DSP Vijay Kakkar told TOI that the SIT would be monitored by him.Family of 26-year-old Sonu, one of the missing, still resides in Ambala Cantonment.
 
 They said their son had gone to the dera believing that the dera head, Gurmeet   Singh, could help people get rid of alcohol addiction.
 
 Sonu allegedly went missing from the premises about three years ago and the family is fast losing hope of finding him. “We haven’t heard from Sonu since he went to the dera. We do not even know if he is dead or alive,” said his mother. The family lodged a complaint regarding his disappearance at Sirsa and Ambala, but there has been no progress.
 
 “Sonu was an alcohol addict and wanted to kick the habit. He decided to try the dera after some of his friends told him how the dera had helped many men give up alcohol with spiritual powers,” Sonu’s mother told TOI.She said when she went to the dera sometime back to find out about her son, the staff deployed there did not let her meet the head. “We posted some posters of Sonu on the walls of dera premises but the followers tore them down and threatened us not to paste them again,” she said.
 
 Investigation officer Satish Kumar said police had not succeeded in tracing Sonu.
