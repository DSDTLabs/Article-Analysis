ALWAR: More than half of Sariska   Reserve (STR) field staff is old with no fresh recruitments made since 1987. The recent death of tiger ST-11 has brought to fore the lack of resources, staff crunch and government’s apathy to step up its efforts of tiger conservation.

 STR is spread across 1,281 sq. km area which is divided into six ranges. The number of personnel has not seen any increase since past many years.
 
 Presently, there are 108 forest guards at STR, far less than its sanctioned strength of 132. “The STR actually needs as many 300 guards for effective protection. We have written to the government many a times but no action has been taken yet,” an official told TOI.
 
 Sources told TOI that STR often draws personnel from   Home Guards (RHG) according to its “operational requirements,” however; these home guards are found to be completely unaware of wildlife, terrain and lack basic skills for tactical patrolling,” an official told TOI.
 
 ‘One guard has to patrol an area of 10 sq. km which is problematic as it’s not possible to be guard every inch of such a long stretch in jungle where there many hillocks and water bodies,” the official said on the condition of anonymity.
 
 The heavily outnumbers guards often have to work in multiple shifts, without any replacements. “The staff crunch is actually taking a toll on the patrolling operations,” said the official, adding that the in the light of renewed threat by poachers is alarming.
