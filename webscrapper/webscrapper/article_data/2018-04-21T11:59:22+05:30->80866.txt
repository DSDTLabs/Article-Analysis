POINGUINIM: Maxem and Loliem villagers have raised concern over the damage caused by heavy container trailers to the Portuguese-era bridges along the national highway (NH) 17, as collapse of these vital links could bring traffic to a halt along the   inter-state route. 

 The bridges, which were built prior to Goa’s liberation, are crucial there is no alternative route to this stretch of the highway in  .
 
 These container trailers carrying heavy machinery often damage the bridges due to problems encountered while manoeuvring the vehicles.
 
 The PWD had recently allowed heavy container trailers of 115 tonnes, mounted with railway engines, to pass over these bridges. Due to this, the Maxem   has now developed cracks, while the iron fittings have been exposed, villagers claimed.
 
 A few days back, locals had stopped and sent back a trailer mounted with railway engines from Polem checkpost, fearing damage to the Portuguese-era bridges along this highway.
 
 Loliem-Polem sarpanch Ajay   and   leader Janardhan Bhandari led a group of villagers to Polem checkpost and inquired with transport department officials as to why these heavy trailers were allowed despite their protests.
 
 “It is PWD officials who have instructed the road transport authorities at Polem to allow these trailers to proceed along this route,” Bhandari alleged.
 
 Lolyekar questioned how the trailers were allowed without the facility of a weigh bridge at the checkpost. He demanded a thorough inquiry into this incident.
