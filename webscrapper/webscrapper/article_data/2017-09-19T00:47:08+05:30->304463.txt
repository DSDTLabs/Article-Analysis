Erode: A nine-year-old girl, who was diagnosed with dengue by a private clinic, died in Erode on Monday.

 S Sudarsini, 9, of Moolaiyur near Andhiyur, was suffering from fever for the past one week. Sudarsini, the daughter of P Senthil Kumar, 34, and Thamaraiselvi, 29, was studying in class IV at a government elementary school in the village. 
 
 “We admitted her in a nearby clinic. Despite the treatment, her condition deteriorated,” Senthil Kumar said. The blood sample of the girl was sent for testing on Saturday. The test results revealed that the girl was suffering from dengue. 
 
 On Monday, her parents decided to admit her to a private hospital in Erode. When she was taken to the hospital, doctors said she was brought dead. “Doctors at the private hospital confirmed that my daughter died of dengue,” Senthil Kumar added.
 
 Residents of Moolaiyur alleged that the health department officials did not take any steps to curb dengue and claimed that Sudarsini was the first girl to die of dengue in their village, even as more than 20 people were admitted to several hospitals including government hospitals in Erode and were treated for dengue earlier.
 
 The residents said, following the death of the girl, the health department officials have sanitized their village by cleaning sewage and closing stagnated water sources and also conducted health camps to the people.
