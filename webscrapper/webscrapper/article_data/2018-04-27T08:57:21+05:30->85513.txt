NEW DELHI:   believes that Gautam Gambhir stepping down as captain of Delhi Daredevils could galvanise the beleaguered franchise as it plays Kolkata Knight Riders at the Feroz Shah Kotla today. 

 
 
 
 
 
 The last time these two teams met in the tournament, KKR won by 71 runs but Kallis, the retired allrounder turned head coach of KKR, was wary of the bottom-placed team posing a stiffer threat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I am not familiar with the background to Gautam stepping down as captain but I am concerned that it might galvanise the team into finding fresh energy and purpose. GG is an honest assessor of his team, the opposition and himself and I wish him the best. Especially after our game,” wrote Kallis in today’s TOI. “The KKR boys are fresh and raring to go. It’s time for us to concentrate on what we do best and make sure we steer matches towards our strengths and then play to them.”
 
 
 
 
 
 KKR return to the field after a five-day gap, having last played on April 21, which in Kallis’ words was a “welcome and refreshing break” for the entire squad and coaching staff. 
 
 “I’m confident that most of the squad have managed to do exactly what they needed to do – which wasn’t very much!” he wrote. “The first thing I do when the   schedule is announced is to look to see where the ‘refuelling’ stops are along the way. I have run this race every year since 2008 as a player and a coach and I’ve seen many individuals and teams run out of energy at critical times because sprinted at the start and didn’t think about staying mentally and physically fresh.”
 
 KKR sit at fourth place on the   leaderboard with three wins from three games, while Daredevils languish at last place having won just a solitary game out of six.
