NAVI MUMBAI: The deadline for the new Vashi   office was October 2015 but the four-storied building is far from over. NMMC has asked the contractor to complete the work in the next two months but sources say “it will be another six months to one year as quite a bit of work is left”.

  City engineer   told TOI, “We have also imposed the maximum penalty on the contractor for the gross delay at 7.5% of the project cost.” The project cost is around Rs 10 crore and the penalty has worked out to be a hefty Rs 75 lakh. The contractor could not get the required fund and that led to the delay, an NMMC official said.
 
 NMMC is funding the project but the money will be paid only after the work is done. The contractor has to first complete the work before the payment is settled, said Dagaonkar. The facility will be a ground-plus-4 storied building with stilt parking facility for 32 four-wheelers.
