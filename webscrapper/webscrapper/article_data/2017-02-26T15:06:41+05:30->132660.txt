' ' director   was one of the first to praise Balakrishna’s ‘Gautamiputra Satakarni’. However, it now looks like the tides have turned as the director has slammed the film's team for wrongly using his name and twisting his statements.
 
  
 
  
  Taking to Facebook, the director explained how his statements from an interview with director   were taken out of context, "When I was asked to do an interview with Krish I obliged because I liked GPSK and genuinely appreciated it. I was asked whether they can use the excerpts of the same interview for print media too and I agreed. But I was surprised to see when it was published as if I have written a letter. True, the content is taken from the interview but the way it was phrased is a bit over dramatic. I asked Krish and he said it his team’s over-enthusiasm."
  
  According to reports, Rajamouli wanted a clarification, but when he didn’t get any, he decided to put out this statement, "I waited for a clarification from them, but it didn’t come through. My view towards the film, Krish and his team hasn’t changed. I wish the film collects even more paving way for more historical… Just that the letters are not written by me.”
  
  A while back, when these letters that were allegedly written by Rajamouli surfaced online, had created quite a stir for its controversial content where the director had apparently questioned Krish’s choices as a filmmaker.
