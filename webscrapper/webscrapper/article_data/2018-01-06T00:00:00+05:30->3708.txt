The passouts of Army Public School, Nehru Road, recently gathered at their school campus for their third meet. Shrieks of laughter, waving hands to catch attention, and hugs turned many emotional who met after a long time. The do kick-started with an audio-video presentation of some cheerful moments shared by the alumni during their school days. "Alumni meets are like homecoming for the students. It makes everyone so nostalgic. I asked all the teachers to post the invitation on their social media profile so that no alumni should be left uninformed," shared  , principal of the school.
A selfie spot, with the picture of school’s main gate and bus, had the alumni and the teachers gunning for it to click pictures at. Games like Guess the Teacher, Best Bunking Methods and Favourite Hiding Point added more fun to the evening.
 The 2017 pass-out head girl, Diksha Singh, anchored the do. 
 Apart from the games, several interesting titles also added to the fun. While Sagar and Malvika got the title for Best Hairstyle, Ashish and Sahiba won the Most Energetic Dancers title. Amit in the blue suit earned the Best Outfit.
 Everyone, including the teachers, later danced on the latest   numbers.
