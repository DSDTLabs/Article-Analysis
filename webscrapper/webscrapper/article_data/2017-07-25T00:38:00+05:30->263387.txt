Porvorim: Strict action will be taken against the three Margao cops who were found with beer bottles while on duty last week, chief minister Manohar Parrikar told the Goa legislative assembly during the Question Hour on Monday. “Police cannot do this and if someone is caught doing this (drinking on duty), I will crack down hard on them. They were lucky that there was no liquor in their blood. If they want to drink beer, they can take leave and drink,” Parrikar said in response to a question raised by leader of opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar. Late Friday night, alert citizens, including singer Sidhanath Buyao, Pravin Naik and Ashesh Paik Dukle had found the PCR staff at Gogol, Margao, holding beer bottles. The public was agitated that the police on night patrol were drinking even as the number of burglaries were on the rise. The opposition leader sought to know how government proposed to control such irregularities by cops.  Parrikar said that despite the medical report stating that there was no alcohol found the trio’s blood stream, action would be taken against them for carrying beer bottles in the PCR van. “We found that they were not drunk. I want to tell the House that three beer bottles were found in the vehicle. I will not tolerate this,” Parrikar said and added that he would not tolerate any request for leniency towards the errant policemen from any legislator. Parrikar also said that his government would not tolerate crimes related to child abuse, drugs, sex and public drinking.
