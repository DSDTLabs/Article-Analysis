Nagpur: City Congress youth president   may be disqualified as a corporator after being found guilty for bringing in women protesters into the Town Hall when a general body meeting was under way. He has been show-caused by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and a reply sought within seven days.

 The notice has been served under section 13 (1) (a) and 2 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations (MMC) Act under which a corporator can be ejected from office. A final decision will be taken by the state government.
 
 Shelke was elected from Mahal (ward no. 18) defeating BJP’s high profile candidate Bandu Raut who is the former standing committee chairman. Raut was in the panel of former mayor and corporator Pravin Datke. Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s too resides in the ward.
 
 It was a shock win. After getting elected, Shelke has been highlighting against poor civic amenities and other services as well as projects of the central and state governments.
 
 To press for increase in daily wages from Rs2,250 per month to Rs18,000 per month, ASHA workers led by Shelke had staged a demonstration in front of the Town Hall on February 3. The workers forcibly entered the house which is considered a violation. 
 
 Following an NMC complaint against Shelke for encouraging women to enter the house, the Kotwali police registered an offence. Additional municipal commissioner Rizwan Siddiqui conducted an inquiry into the case and reportedly held Shelke responsible for the incident based on which the notice was issued by commissioner Ashwin Mudgal.
