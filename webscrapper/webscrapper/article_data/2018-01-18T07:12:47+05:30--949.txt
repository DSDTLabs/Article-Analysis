BENGALURU: Owners of 116 of the 248 properties to be acquired for widening   sought monetary compensation instead of transfer of development rights ( ) at a public hearing here on Wednesday.

 In its 2015-16 budget, the government had earmarked Rs 100 crore for widening the 4.74km stretch from   to   rail overbridge. The BBMP said it would issue TDRs, not monetary compensation, to the property owners.
 
 “Of the 248 owners, 116 outrightly rejected TDR and we asked BBMP to compensate us fairly. Before issuing tender notifications, the Palike should have done a social impact study, to see how many landowners and shopowners would be affected,” said Bhagath Reddy, one of the property owners. 
 
 Residents also said the BBMP should develop arterial roads since widening the main stretch alone won’t make much of a difference.
 
 BBMP special commissioner (projects) B M   said their demands will be looked into. “They have asked us to see if the proposed road width can be brought down from 45m so that loss of property is reduced. They also requested the junctions and sub-arterial roads be improved, traffic signals installed, and they be given compensation instead of TDR,” he said.
