 Some parts of Indore division and neighbouring areas also experienced light rain showers.
 
 Areas like Neemuch and neighbouring rural areas experienced hailstorm on Thursday evening and night. Various parts of   district witnessed rainfall.
 
 According to the Met department, a combination of light rain showers and cold winds from the north are responsible for the cold weather that has hit the city once again.
 
 Met director, Anupam Kashyapi said, “The weather has turned in the state due to northerly winds setting back here. Snow and rain in the northern part of India have resulted in dropping temperature here.”
 
 “Rain and hailstorms in many parts of the state is due a western disturbance in northern India. The northerly wind’s comeback will result in a sharp fall in the maximum and minimum temperature,” he added.
 
 The minimum temperature is expected to dip as low as 10 degrees Celsius over the next few days.
 
 “Though it feels good the temperature has dropped, it becomes risky as we are prone to seasonal diseases and infections,” said Charu Jotwani, a working professional from the city.
