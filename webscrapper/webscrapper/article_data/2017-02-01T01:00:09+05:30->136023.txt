Many successful people are vocal about their inspirations and so are these women achievers, too. In an event organised in the city, some of them got together to acknowledge their parents who’ve been relentlessly supporting them. As each of them got on stage with their loved ones, all they had to say was ‘Thank you mom/dad’. Among others, one duo that grabbed the attention of everyone at the award ceremony was Aishwarya R Dhanush and her mother Latha Rajnikanth. Actress Tamannaah with her mother Rajni, too, was spotted at the venue. There were also achievers from sports, theatre, performing arts, etc.
