BENGALURU:  's   team was dealt a blow on Tuesday with the talismanic   pulling out of the   second round match against India here after failing to recover from a foot injury . Istomin, the world No. 71, stayed back in Tashkent to undergo tests on his left foot.He was scheduled to arrive on Wednesday but the team confirmed the 30-year-old's travel plans were cancelled, adding that he would be out of action for two weeks.

 “Istomin was initially supposed to come on Saturday but when he said he would stay back for tests on his foot, I had a feeling he would not turn up at all. I had a back-up plan in place. Now, with two days left, it gives me enough time to work on who plays singles and doubles,“ Uzbekistan's non-playing captain   said.
 
 Lebed had earlier said during the official press conference that the tie was more evenly balanced now. “Both are young teams. It's like a 50-50 game and after the first day , we will see how it goes,“ he said when asked about his game plan. “We have four options if Denis doesn't come. They're all different players and I'll decide later who to play .“
 
 Meanwhile, the team's senior pro Farrukh Dustov said he was prepared to play on all three days of the April 7-9 clash.
