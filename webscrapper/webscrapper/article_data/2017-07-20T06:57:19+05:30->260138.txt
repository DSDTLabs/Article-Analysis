LUCKNOW: A student preparing for competitive exams was   at by   with a gun they stole from his house in   in the wee-hours of Wednesday. Advocate Syed Razi,   Syed Naseem Haider, returned home from a wedding at 2.30am. 

 When his wife Zahira woke up to open the door, she saw three thieves in the house and raised an alarm and they jumped off the first floor. Razi tried to stop them and meanwhile, rest of the family, including Syed Salman, came out. Using the licensed revolver belonging to their elder brother Syed Imran, one of the miscreants opened fire at the brothers and a bullet hit Salman’s ankle. Razi told police that the miscreants dropped the gun and some of the valuables they had stolen from the Imran’s room and fled the scene. Razi said in the FIR that the thieves entered the house by removing the grill on the backdoor in the kitchen. Salman was rushed to the hospital and is out of danger. 
 
 Mahanagar police circle officer Anurag Singh said a car was found abandoned near the house where the theft took place. “Preliminary investigation showed the car was stolen from Indiranagar and had a fake number and it appears the miscreants came in the car but left it behind in a hurry,” said Singh. Vikasnagar police station officer Sumit Srivastava said a case of theft had been registered.
