AHMEDABAD: Today is the day of reckoning for Ahmedabad city. The 41st session of Unesco’s World   Committee meeting will analyze threadbare whether the 606-year-old Walled City of Ahmedabad deserves the World Heritage City status — the highest global recognition that a site of cultural significance can receive. The session will be webcast live from Kraków, Poland, on Saturday. 

 On Friday, the WHC inducted   (Palestine) and W-Arly-Pendjari Complex (Benin, Burkina Faso) into the World Heritage List in the morning session. The WHC simultaneously added the site of Hebron-Al Khalil to the list of   in Danger. The ‘Historic City of Ahmedabad’ is slated for analysis on Saturday. 
 
  Ahmedabad’s Walled City was India’s first city to make it into the tentative list in 2011. If selected, the Walled City will join the likes of Paris, Cairo, and Edinburgh and leave behind Delhi’s Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone and Shahjahanabad in Old Delhi whose nomination was turned down last year. 
 
 Mumbai is also waiting to be nominated. In all, 36 sites across the world are vying for the coveted status. The only other Indian entry is Bhitarkanika crocodile reserve in Odisha, which is seeking the natural heritage status against four such sites across the world. The Walled City of Ahmedabad will compete with 26 cultural sites. The 41st session of the WHC, chaired by Jacek Purchla, the founder and director of the International Cultural Centre in Kraków, will continue inscribing sites onto the World Heritage List through July 9.
 
 “We have our fingers crossed. Even if Ahmedabad is considered for the referral stage, it is a sign of hope for us all,” a senior AMC official said. “But we hope for the best on Saturday.”
