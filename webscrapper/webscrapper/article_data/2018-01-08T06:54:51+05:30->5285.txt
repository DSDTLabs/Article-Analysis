CHENNAI: A 40-year-old man on Saturday night murdered his elderly foster mother and her sister in the western suburb of  , police said on Sunday.

 Balakrishnan killed his foster mother  , 85, and her sister  , 70, of Mathiravedu Mettu Street, police said.
 
 “Ranganayagi, her son  , 58, and his family lived together,” aninvestigating officer said. “Ezhumalai and his family left to attend a wedding so his mother invited her sister to stay with her till they returned.”
 
 On Sunday morning, Krishnaveni’s foster son  , 38, arrived at Ranganayagi’s house with tea for the women. He found them dead and the house blood-spattered and informed the Thiruverkadu police. They arrived at the scene and started a probe.
 
 “There were security cameras in the house but they were disconnected from the recorder,” the officer said. “The killer made away with a gold chain from one of the women to make the crime appear like a murder for gain.”
 
 Investigators suspected that the victims knew the killer; and that the killer was aware that the security cameras were not working. Ranganayagi’s foster son, Balakrishnan, became their prime suspect after they learned that there had been a dispute between him and the rest of the family over his claim to a share of Ranganayagi’s property.
 
 A police team went in search of Balakrishnan and found that he was in hiding. Investigators later apprehended Balakrishnan from a friend’s house and seized a bloodstained shirt from him.
 
 “During interrogation, Balakrishnan admitted that he was unhappy over Ranganayagi leaving all of her property to her son Ezhumalai and giving him nothing,” the officer said.
 
 “Balakrishnan planned to kill her when Ezhumalai and his family left for the wedding,” he said. “He didn’t intend to murder Krishnaveni. But Krishnaveni witnessed him slitting her sister’s throat so he killed her as well.”
 
 A probe is continuing to determine if Balakrishnan acted alone or received help to commit the crime.
