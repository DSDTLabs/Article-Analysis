JALPAIGURI: An adult rhino was killed and its horn was chopped off at Jaldapara national park on February 5. The carcass of the animal was buried at the Torsa riverbed in BD -1 compartment inside the forest. The Jaldapara forest division officials have arrested six persons over the past 24 hours and recovered the horn. 

 A .303 rifle was also recovered from inside the forest.
 
 The arrested persons have been identified as Marto Riba from  , Sanjib Lama from Siliguri, Raju Rava from Jaldapara, Sevok Kami and Rupesh Rava from Kodalbustee and   from Banerhat.
 
 Incidents of poaching are not new for Jaldapara. Over 70 rhinos have been poached at Jaldapara in different times from 1951. 
 
 In April 2018, two rhinos were poached in Gorumara national park. The Jaldapara national park is one among four forest tracts in India where the one-horned rhino can be seen in the wild. The others are  's   and Manas national parks and Bengal's Gorumara National Park. 
 
 Conservationists blame the deaths for the consistent poaching of animals in Bengal. According to Animesh Basu of  , the forest department has a present staff shortage by 36 percent. "Whenever we ask the forest department to fill up the posts, officials only give us assurances. But nothing happens," said Basu.
