LUCKNOW: In a rare medical feat, endocrine surgeons at Dr   removed a rare adrenal tumour from the stomach of a five-year-old girl. 

 The surgery was performed at the maternal and child referral hospital of the institute by a team headed by endocrine surgeon Dr Roma  . The girl, a resident of   in Lucknow, was admitted to the paediatric OPD of the hospital recently on complaints of hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and excessive weight gain. As a CT scan showed adrenal mass, the patient was referred to the endocrine surgery department on suspicion of functioning adrenal tumour.
 
 Dr Pradhan said, "We found that her cortisol and testosterone (sex hormone) levels were markedly raised, which gave a strong suspicion of cancer. After the tests, the right adrenal tumour was removed." Others in the team were Dr Tanvir Roshan, Dr Umesh, Dr   and Dr Amit.
 
 The surgery ensured that her growth was not affected and no further damage done. She had high levels of the male hormone which led to the condition, added Dr Pradhan. 
 
  The patient was discharged on Tuesday after her cortisol levels were found normal.
