MANGALURU: In what prima facie appears to be a case of Naxals heading back into residential areas, three people were seen with arms at a village near   under   police station limits.

  district superintendent of police   said the trio included a woman. He said they entered a village, took grocery items and left the spot. However, it is yet to be established whether the three were indeed Naxals.
 
 Reddy said a case under the arms act and all relevant sections will be registered at the Uppinangadi police station.
