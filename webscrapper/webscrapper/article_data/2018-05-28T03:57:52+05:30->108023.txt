AHMEDABAD: The Institute of Seismological Research (ISR), a state agency, has come out with an ‘earthquake hazard map’ of  , which provides information about how intense the ground movement can be if earthquake hits a particular place.

 It can help town planners and architects to take necessary precautions to mitigate the impact of a possible earthquake, ISR officials said.
 
 To prepare the map, the ISR took into account data of seismic activities in Gujarat from as back as 1668. It plans to bring out the map in a coffee-table book format, said  , director general of the ISR.
 
 “We have developed the map for all 33 districts. It shows ground acceleration to be experienced in different parts of the state. It can come in handy for town planners to assess possible intensity of an earthquake,” Kumar said.
 
 According to the map,   and the   in Kutch district are highly active seismic zones, and are expected to experience the highest degree of ground motion in the state.
 
 Kutch region, especially the Bhuj town, had experienced a devastating earthquake in 2001 which claimed more than 10,000 lives.
 
 The map is crucial for Gujarat which has a high level of industrialisation and where a number of smart cities and mega-cities are coming up, said ISR scientist Madan Mohan Rout.
