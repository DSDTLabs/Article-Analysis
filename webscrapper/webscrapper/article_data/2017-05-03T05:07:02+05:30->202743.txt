MUMBAI: After scrapping AC buses for lack of patronage, BEST general manager Jagdish Patil is having second thoughts. He said on Tuesday that the transport undertaking was willing to "restart" a few   based on demand but commuters would have to purchase at least 45 quarterly bus passes for any such route to operate. 

 "We have about 200 road-worthy AC buses. Some can be operated on routes where there is demand," Patil said. At least four delegations of commuters, mainly office-goers, recently urged him to restart few routes.
 
 Suhas Naik-Satam, a regular commuter, said, "I travel to work from Chembur to Worli for 20 days a month. I would spend about Rs100 daily for AC bus commute, which comes to Rs2,000 a month." Patil pointed out that maintaining and running AC buses was a huge burden on the BST. "By scrapping the buses, BEST will save Rs200 crore annually," he said.
 
 He said a Magic AC bus pass was Rs 3,300 a month, which is less than what commuters would spend if they travelled by aggregator cabs daily. "It will be more expensive in AC taxis daily. If commuters are serious about travelling only in AC buses and want us to restart operations, we will restore few routes," he said.
 
 Another commuter said travelling in an AC bus for Rs15-60 (up to 20km) or on a daily pass of Rs150 was affordable. A BEST official said all buses will be auctioned soon. Few AC buses are being used for Mumbai Darshan and one is being operated with white-and-yellow stripes on an experimental basis at BKC.
