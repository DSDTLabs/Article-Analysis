SURAT: SMC is under pressure from   to drop the proposal in the   and   or lower the rate. BJP leaders did not want to   earlier because of   and assembly elections and now they are opposing it because of parliamentary polls next year. 

 The SMC had recently submitted Rs5,378 crore draft budget and sought to raise Rs543 crore by hiking property tax and user charges. 
 
 “Our predecessors should have increased taxes by 20% per year but not so steeply. Many MLAs too have asked us to reject the tax hike,” said a BJP leader. The tax hikes will be take up for discussion on Tuesday.
 
 Deputy mayor Shankar Chevli said, “We will soon arrive at some decision on the issue. If we need to sustain SMC financially, some hike in tax rates is required.” 
 
 Standing committee chairman Rajesh Desai told TOI, “We have to hike taxes, but the question is how much. We will come up with a solution. It is a good idea to raise the required amount in a span of five years.”
