SAN FRANCISCO: YouTube,   and   are the most popular online platforms among US teenagers today, pushing  , which once dominated the social media landscape, to the fourth position, according to a new survey.

 
 Today, roughly half (51 per cent) of US teenagers between ages 13 and 17 say they use Facebook, notably lower than the shares who use YouTube, Facebook owned Instagram or Snapchat, showed the   survey results released on Thursday. While 85 per cent teenagers use YouTube, 72 per cent use Instagram and 69 per cent use Snapchat, showed the survey conducted between March 7 to April 10, 2018. 
 
 Notably, lower-income teenagers are more likely to gravitate toward Facebook than those from higher-income households. Seven-in-10 teenagers living in households earning less than $30,000 a year say they use Facebook, compared with 36 per cent whose annual family income is $75,000 or more, the results showed.
 
 Interestingly, girls were more likely than boys to say Snapchat is the site they use most often, while boys were more inclined than girls to identify YouTube as their go-to platform.
