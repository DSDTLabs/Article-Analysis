Salem: A 42-year-old man, who duped many government officials posing as an IAS officer, was arrested on Monday. The arrested was identified as L Vijayakumar, of Eathapur, near Vazhapadi here.

 During the interrogation, it has come to light that Vijayakumar had visited many districts and conducted departmental meetings with district officials by introducing himself as chairman of various central government schemes, including Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), task force on national skills and research policy and national commission on pharma sector skill council of India.
 
 “He had ordered officials to carry out various developmental activities under PMBJP and sought bribe from them,” the police said.
 
 According to Salem city crime branch police, they nabbed Vijayakumar, who was staying in a star hotel in the city, based on a tip by some BJP functionaries. Vijayakumar, they said, invited BJP functionaries from Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Krishangiri and Erode districts to participate in a meeting to discuss matters related to PMBJP.
 
 “A few of them met Vijayakumar in the hotel, where he told them about his plans to bring many schemes to Salem district under PMBJP. Feeling suspicious, the BJP workers contacted their leaders in New Delhi and the latter told them that the central government hadn’t send any such person to hold meetings with them or departmental heads,” the police said.
 
 Immediately, the BJP functionaries alerted Salem city crime branch police, who picked up Vijayakumar from the hotel on Monday.
 
 During the inquiry, Vijayakumar confessed to the crime. The police arrested him based on his confessional statement and produced him before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody. Subsequently, Vijayakumar was lodged at the Salem Central Prison.
 
 It is to be noted that the Salem city police had arrested Vijayakumar some 10 years ago when he posed as the project director of Valar Kalvi school scheme.
