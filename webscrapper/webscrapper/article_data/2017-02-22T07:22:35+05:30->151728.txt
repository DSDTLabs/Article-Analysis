KOLKATA: Bengal along with Tamil Nadu has turned in the most impressive family planning figures, latest data has revealed.

 According to figures released by the   (FPAI) for 2014, the state has registered a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 1.7, the lowest in the country . The TFR for Kolkata is even lower at 1.2, exactly half the national average of 2.4. TFR is considered a family planning indicator as it points to the number of children a woman can bear in her childbearing years.
 
 The TFR has a direct bearing on birth rate. Bengal's current birth rate is 16.1 (live births per 1,000), which is much lower than the national average of 21.6. Bengal also tops in low death rate count - 6.3 against the national average of 7.
 
 “Though the Bengal figures look impressive, there is much to be desired as far as contraceptive awareness and use, underage marriages and underage maternity are concerned,“ said  , national President of FPAI. Besides, 21% of the state's fertile population is still beyond the scope of contraception.
 
 The FPAI, which is affiliated to the  , will begin an awareness drive from Kolkata on Wednesday, considering Bengal's status in the national scenario.
 
 The FPAI has not only been partnering with the ministry in distributing free traditional contraception options, but has also been pushing for the introduction of latest products like injectable contraceptives and progesterone pills.
 
 “There is severe lack of awareness among couples about contraception even in Bengal especially about the injectable options that can prevent pregnancy for as long as three months.“
 
 said  , who heads the state wing of the FPAI. The figures are startling as far as underage maternity is concerned with girls as young as 14 being forced into childbearing, Mazumdar said.
