ALAPPUZHA:   under CPM staged one day agitation at Ramankari near here on Monday alleging that the union government failed to disburse the price of the   from them. 

 “Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation procured paddy from   for Rs 22.50 per kg. Out of 22.50, the contribution of the union government is Rs 14.70. But the union government has failed to pay the price of the procured paddy from April 1, 2017. 
 
 Of the total amount Union government needs to pay Rs 90 crore. Most of the farmers are reeling under debt and are unable to take up cultivation. 
 
 But the centre government is not taking any steps to release the amount. So we organized the agitation,’’ said CPM leaders.
 
 CPM district secretary Saji Cherian while inaugurated the agitation said that CPM will not give any face value to the threats by highlighting vote banks. ‘They can criticize the liquor policy of the state government. But they should not try to threaten the CPM saying they will show us during poll time. Liquor consumption is high in regions where majority population are Christians. 
 
 Religious leaders should first issue pastoral letters demanding their followers to stop the consumption of liquor. It is those, who are not ready to criticize the communal party BJP, are now criticizing CPM, which maintains secular stand,’’ said Saji. At the same time, BJP district president K Soman alleged that the CPM is leveling baseless allegations against the union government. 
 
 “The centre has allotted all the funds for the farmers. But the state government diverted the funds for other purpose. They are trying to degrade the union government in front of farmers leveling baseless allegations,’’ he said.
 
 Meanwhile in Thrissur, the annual meeting of the representatives of kole farmers, was disrupted by protesting farmers who demanded the payment for paddy procured through Sypplyco.
