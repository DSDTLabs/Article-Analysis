UDHAGAMANDALAM: While thousands of people are rushing to the Sim’s Park in Coonoor to watch the 59th edition of the fruit show that was inaugurated on Saturday, some are crying foul over the extravaganza.

 The event is nothing but utter waste of fruits, says a social activist. “The trend of   various models made of fruits was not prevalent till 10-12 years ago. Fruit shows in those days were meant to showcase hill-grown fruits. There used to be a vast display of plum, peach, pear and oranges, besides hill-grown wild fruits. Where are they now?” he asks. 
 
 “Wasting tonnes of fruits, mostly grown in the plains, by making replicas, is a mere eyewash and a criminal waste of food. Around 3,000 kg of fruits are wasted in this manner,” he adds.
 
 Another activist said, “It is high time the horticulture department gives up the culture of wasting fruits in the name of shows. Rather, they should concentrate on reviving cultivation of fruits here, which are on the verge of extinction. Pear, peach and plum are rarely available in the hills now-a-days. A revival programme for hill-grown fruits by the horticulture department will certainly set a healthy trend,” he told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, horticulture department officials justified the practice of showcasing fruits in such manner. “It is mainly to attract tourists. The government has to make a decision if at all the trend is to be changed,” an official said.
 
 A model of a   bull made using 2,000 kg of various kinds of fruits is the major attraction at the show, which was inaugurated by Nilgiris collector P Sankar. It concludes today.
