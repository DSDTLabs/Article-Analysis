CHENNAI: The anti-corruption wing of CBI on Wednesday booked two senior officials from the Chennai office of Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks for demanding bribes to issue patents to a private company.

 Dr S P Subramaniyan, the deputy controller and branch head, patents and designs, in Anna Nagar, and his predecessor T V Madhusudhan, have been booked for criminal conspiracy and accepting bribes.
 
 Subramaniyan, in 2015, had demanded a bribe of Rs 3 lakh from G R  , proprietor of Radha Decors in  , for issuing patent rights for an ornamental plaster mould. 
 
 He had submitted the design in 2010, but was allegedly made to wait five years. The patent was awarded to him after he paid the bribe.
 
 The CBI said that Subramaniyan then allegedly asked Kaliapermual to issue legal notices to four firms — M/s   plaster industrial (a Malaysian company), P Sunil of Chennai, M/s Diamond international Inex Pvt Ltd in Gurgaon and M   of Madurai — for importing the same technology for which the patent was given.
 
 However, the companies filed a post-grant opposition case against Kaliaperumal for revoking the patent.
 
 On June 9 last year, Subramaniyan and Madhusudhan demanded Rs 10 lakh from Kaliaperumal to decide the case in his favour. An order was then passed against him because he allegedly could not pay up.
 
 CBI has also booked Kaliaperumal in the FIR.
