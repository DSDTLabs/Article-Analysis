LUCKNOW: Congress president   on Tuesday approved a 36-member Pradesh Election Committee (PEC) for poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. UP Congress Committee (UPCC) chief   has been designated chairman, while former UPCC chief Nirmal Khatri will be the co-chairman of the PEC.

 The 36-member PEC also has Congress’ chief ministerial candidate  , Congress legislature party leader Pradeep Mathur, Rajya Sabha members Sanjay Sinh, Pramod Tiwari and PL Punia, and former MPs Salman Khurshid, Sriprakash Jaiswal, Jitin Prasada, RPN Singh, Gayadin Anuragi and  , among others. 
 
 The PEC has been asked to collect applications from ticket-seekers and recommendations from district and block Congress committees, run background checks on applicants and make initial recommendations to the Congress screening committee. 
 
 The screening committee will then recommend a further filtered list of names—one or two names on every seat—to the Chief Election Committtee. Chaired by Sonia, the CEC will then take a final call on ticket distribution. 
 
 Sources in the Congress said Babbar and Khatri had already prepared a preliminary list of Congress probables for forwarding to the screening committee. The high command may also appoint the chairperson of the screening committee shortly.
