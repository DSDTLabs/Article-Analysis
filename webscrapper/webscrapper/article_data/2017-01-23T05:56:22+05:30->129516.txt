BHUBANESWAR: For the  , the   at Kuneru in Andhra Pradesh in which 39 people were killed is the worst ever in its history in terms of casualties since it was formed as a separate railway zone in 2003.

 The derailment in   comes barely two months after 146 people died when 15 coaches of   derailed while crossing a bridge, 70km from Kanpur, in November last year.
 
 However, within the ECoR jurisdiction spread over three states of Odisha, AP and Chhattisgarh, the biggest mishap before Kuneru was in February 2009 when 14 coaches of Coromandal Express (Howrah-Chennai) had derailed near Jajpur Road in Odisha, 120km north of Bhubaneswar, killing 15.
 
 "The Saturday mishap casualty is the highest in single incident under ECoR zone," said ECoR chief public relations officer J P Mishra.
 
 The railway sources said a goods train standing on a parallel track near Kuneru helped minimize the magnitude of damage of the derailed train. The derailed coaches of Hirakhand Express were saved from free fall by the rear side of wagons of the stationary goods train. Three wagons of the goods train were damaged, said a senior official.
 
 Hirakhand Express had no scheduled stoppage at Kuneru. The Hirakhand Express was coming from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh and was going to Bhubaneswar. A portion of the train (link) from Junagarh in Kalahandi district gets amalgamated at Rayagada. The accident happened barely half-an-hour after the train left Rayagada for Bhubaneswar. It was scheduled to reach here at 8.30am on Sunday.
 
 Nine coaches consisting one guard-cum-luggage van, two general second class, four sleeper class and two AC coaches were damaged in the accident, the sources said. The limit of ECoR, with headquarters in Bhubaneswar, spreads to most parts of Odisha, parts of Srikakulam, Vizainagaram and Visakhapatnam districts of Andhra Pradesh besides Bastar and Dantewada districts of Chhattisgarh along the country's east coast.
