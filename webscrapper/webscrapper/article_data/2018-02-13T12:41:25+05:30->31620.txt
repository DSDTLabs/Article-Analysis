Trichy: A land surveyor in   was sentenced to seven years imprisonment by the chief judicial magistrate court on Monday after being found guilty of seeking and accepting a   of Rs 2,500 to survey a piece of land five years ago.

 According to the prosecution, the convicted land surveyor was identified as Manimozhi, 63, a native of R S Mathur village near Ariyalur. In 2012, when   was posted as the land surveyor in Kuvagam, Karunanidhi, 43,   employee from Andimadam in Ariyalur, had placed a request with Manimozhi to survey a land belonging to his wife Vijaya near Kuvagam.
 
 However, to survey the land, the surveyor demanded a bribe of Rs 2,500 from the TNSTC employee. Unwilling to pay the bribe, Karunanidhi approached the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) in Ariyalur.
 
 As instructed by the anti-corruption squad, Karunanidhi on August 17, 2012, offered the sought bribe of Rs 2,500 to Manimozhi with chemically laced currencies, as per instructions by DVAC. Subsequently, DVAC sleuths caught the land surveyor red-handed while accepting the bribe. The case was under trial at the chief judicial magistrate court in Ariyalur.
 
 On Monday, hearing the final arguments, the judge found the land surveyor guilty of accepting the bribe and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment and also to pay a penalty of Rs 20,000. Following the judgement, Manimozhi was lodged at the Trichy central prison by the police.
