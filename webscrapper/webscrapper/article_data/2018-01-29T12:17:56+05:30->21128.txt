DEHRADUN: An analysis of the data of the recent   shows that while the prevalence of anaemia among   in the country has decreased marginally by around 2 % -- from 55 % in 2005-06 to 53 % in 2015-16, a worrying trend is that six major states of the country have shown a marked increase in total anaemic cases among women. As per the report, the highest rise of anaemic women has been noted in   (15.5% rise) followed by Delhi (10%) and   (6.6%).
 
  In 2005-06, says the report, Punjab had just 38% cases which increased to 53.5% cases a decade later. Similarly, Delhi had 44.3% cases in 2005-06 which jumped to 54.3% cases 10 years later. Haryana saw a rise from 56.1% to 62.7% in a similar period while Uttar Pradesh registered an increase from 49.9% to 52.4%, Incidentally, states which have good health performance parameters like Tamil Nadu and Kerala also recorded an increase in the number of anaemic women. Tamil Nadu had 53.2% cases a decade ago which increased to 55 % while Kerala showed an increase from 32.8% to 34.2%.
  
  The report says that out of the 36 states of India, 21 had over 50% women suffering from anaemia.   came out as the worst state in this regard with a whopping 65.2% anaemic women and 29.9% anaemic men. Among union territories (which were surveyed for the first time), Dadra and Nagar Haveli fared worst with 79.5% women and 30.7% men in this category.
  
  Interestingly, while many major states recorded an increase in the number of anaemic women, North-eastern states reported a dip in their numbers. For instance, Assam had 69.9% anaemic women in 2005-06 which decreased to 46% after a decade. Similarly, Sikkim, too, reported an impressive decline in anaemic women numbers from 60% to 34.9% over the course of a decade.Uttarakhand, too, recorded a decrease in the number of anaemic women — from 55.2% in 2005-06 to 45.2% in 2015-16.
  
  Elaborating on the reasons behind women being prone to anaemia, Dr Archana Srivastava, director general of health and family welfare,  , said, “The prime reason behind so many cases is because of iron-less diet and worm infestation. Women in puberty have menstruation too which further induces anaemia among them. Also, consuming tea with food mitigates the absorption of iron from the diet.”
