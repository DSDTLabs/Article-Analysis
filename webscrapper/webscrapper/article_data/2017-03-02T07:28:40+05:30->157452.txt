THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Education minister   has ruled out any immediate possibility of the government adopting an education policy that would pave way for the   appointing teachers in aided educational institutions. 

 Replying to a calling attention motion by   C Divakaran in the assembly on Wednesday, the education minister said the government was yet to take a policy decision on making appointments in aided educational institutions through PSC. "The managements of these aided institutions are appointing teachers as per prescribed rules and regulations and it would continue to be so," he said.
 
 Though the CPI MLA repeatedly asked the education minister and the chief minister if there was any legal obstacle for a policy amendment to this effect, Raveendranath preferred to repeat his statement while   opted to remain silent.
 
 Earlier, Divakaran pointed out that the managements of aided schools and colleges in the state were flouting all reservation norms denying the backward communities their representation as teachers in these institutions. "Under these corporate managements, education has become a big business and it's high time the appointments were entrusted with the PSC," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, on a submission by CPM MLA A M Ariff for making it mandatory in all schools to render the   (National Service Scheme) theme song at least once in a month or once in a week, the education minister said the song which upholds religious harmony was most suitable for singing in schools.
