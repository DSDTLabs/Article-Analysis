LUCKNOW: It was a sea of black on the grounds of   as thousands of women in burqas gathered on Sunday afternoon for a peaceful protest against the triple talaq bill. 

 The protesters termed the bill anti-women and anti-family and sent forth a memorandum to the President seeking a roll back of the 'draconian' bill. 
 
 Leaving behind work and household chores, the women had gathered from various cities of the state on the call of   (AIMPLB). Many had their children in tow to "protect   from government meddling." 
 
  They waved scores of placrads declaring triple talaq anti-social, anti-children, anti-women and unconstitutional, in Hindi, English and Urdu. The Indian flag was also waved by the women. 
 
 Outside the mosque, water and juice stalls had come up to serve them. The protests have already covered 16 states. 
 
  Leading the protest were executive committee members of AIMPLB Dr Asma   from Hyderabad and   from Delhi along with the convener in Lucknow Nighat Parveen. 
 
  Addressing the gathering, Dr Zehra said, "We demand the bill goes since Muslim women are satisfied in personal laws allowed to them under the constitution. The government is not bringing the bill in any sympathy for the Muslims but only as an interference in Shariah, which we will not accept." 
 
  Amid loud claps, she continued, "The bill was passed by   in haste without consultation from AIMPLB or women's organisations." 
 
 Parveen said, "The government says the bill is for Muslim women's emancipation, but we have been empowered for 1400 years now. Muslim women have the right to choice in marriage, in ancestral property, in divorce and to re-marry, unlike other communities."
 
  Responding to Dr Zehra's call, the protesters echoed in unison, "We are with Shariah. We condemn triple talaq bill. Take the bill back."
