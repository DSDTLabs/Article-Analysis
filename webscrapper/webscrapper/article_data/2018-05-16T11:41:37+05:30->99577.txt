Film writer-editor Apurva   has thanked his family and friends for their support in his battle with  's Palsy that had nearly crippled his face. After a period of rigorous physiotherapy his facial functions have been restored to near normal, said Asrani, who has come out in the open to talk about the disformity he has been experiencing since January.

  
  
 The   writer had first revealed in March that he woke up with Bell's Palsy - a condition that leaves the face partially paralyzed. "Four months today since I woke up with Bells Palsy and the right side of my face fully  . I couldn't smile, I got vertigo and impaired vision."
 
 "It was terrifying. Grateful that the love and support of friends and family plus rigorous physiotherapy has restored my face to near normal," Asrani tweeted late on Tuesday.
 
 He also shared a before and after photograph of himself. In one image Asrani is trying to smile and in the other he can be seen fully smiling at the camera.
