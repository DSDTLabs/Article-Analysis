PATNA: Taking a swipe at   president Rahul Gandhi’s recent remark that he was ready to become PM if Congress or a coalition led by the party wins the Lok Sabha election next year,   and LJP president   on Sunday said there is no vacancy for the top post in 2019.

 “The post is already booked (reserved) in the name of Narendra Modi,”   said and pointed out that   is the lone candidate for the PM’s post from NDA camp whereas opposition has several candidates like Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, Chandrababu Naidu and Sharad Pawar.
 
 The LJP chief also claimed the NDA would secure a clear majority in Karnataka and form next government in the state.
 
 While interacting with eminent personalities of Bengaluru on Tuesday, Rahul said he was ready to be PM in 2019 if the Congress or a coalition led by the party wins next year’s Lok Sabha elections. 
 
 Supporting Rahul, BJP’s disgruntled leader and Patna Sahib MP Shatrughan Sinha on Saturday had said the Congress president, who has “matured in the past few years”, was popular with the public and asked, “What was wrong if the leader heading the biggest, oldest national party saw a possibility of becoming the next prime minister.”
 
 Sinha, in a tweet, also said, “Anybody can become PM in our country ... naamdar, kaamdar, daamdar or for that matter any average samajhdaar, if he has the numbers and support.” Patna Sahib MP was, in fact, referring to a recent comment of the PM on Rahul in which Modi had allegedly mocked the Congress president by terming him ‘naamdar’ (famous due to family).
 
 “Congress president, sir, we cannot sit before you. You are ‘naamdar’, while I am ‘kaamdar’ (ordinary worker who believes in work). We have no status to sit in front of you,” Modi had said while addressing an election rally in Karnataka.
