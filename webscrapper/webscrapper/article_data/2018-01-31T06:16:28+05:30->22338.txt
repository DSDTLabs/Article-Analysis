LUCKNOW: The Centre has sought inputs from states on whether the ‘Singapore Model’ to counter   with community involvement can be implemented in the country. Instead of taking radicalised youth through a long criminal trial, the model advocates lessons in nationalism and religious rehabilitation with the help of popular scholars and community leaders.

 “For Indian conditions, among various counter-radical programmes being undertaken by different countries, the Singapore Model, (which is) a combination of hard security measures and stringent laws with community involvement, is best suited. Action may be taken by DGP of states/UTs,” says a note sent on January 21 this year by   of home affairs (MHA) to police chiefs and home departments of states. UP,   are among the few states from which MHA has sought this assistance.
 
 The Centre’s proposal further states that there is a need for “involvement of a dedicated ministry for dissemination of effective counter narratives.”
 
 “There is a need to develop a standard operative procedure (SOP) to deal with radical material and websites along with three-pronged counselling system involving the family, clergy and professionals,” it says.
 
 “The effort is to get back the Indian youth who have got drawn by organisations like the Islamic State (IS) in the recent past due to various reasons,” said a senior   official. “There is a need for eminent Muslim religious leaders to come forward with credible counter narratives and alternate narratives,” he added.
 
 The Centre is also learnt to have sought assistance from states to bring together “reformed elements” and “victims of terrorism” in the programme to remove radicalism.
 
 The Centre has also advised the states that a close watch must be maintained on foreign donations of Wahahabi-Salafi doctrinated-outfits. The same proposal also seeks the cooperation of states to help contribute to a cell in the ministry of home affairs that will deal with “anti-national propaganda”.
