AHMEDABAD: Even as   by state-run   State   Corporation Ltd (GSECL) declines, the share of the central sector’s contribution to state’s electricity generation has almost doubled over the last five fiscals.

 According to the Socio Economic Review 2016-17, the central sector contributed 22,480 million units (MUs) to Gujarat’s total 1,03,137 MUs of electricity generation in 2015-16, or about 21.79%. 
 
  Against this, the central sector accounted for 8,723 MUs or 11.09% of 78,651 MUs generated in 2011-12. 
 
 The power supplied from central government-operated power projects to states is the share of the centre in a state’s total power generation.
 
 Compared to the central sector, Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd (GSECL) accounted for 19,225 MUs and the private sector (including the state’s independent power producers) for 61,432 MUs of total electricity generated in Gujarat in 2015-16. GSECL’s contribution was much higher at 28,638 MUs in 2011-12, when 78,651 MUs was generated overall.
 
 According to the review, the industrial segment accounted for 49.61% of total electricity consumption in 2015-16 followed by agriculture with 23.12% and the domestic sector at 17.78%. Electricity consumption in 2015-16 was 75,841 MUs.
 
 “Power supplied from the central pool by NTPC is currently cheaper as many of its generating units are near coal blocks, which results in lower transportation cost,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy expert.
 
 According to Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (GERC) merit order, power utilities are required to give priority to cheaper power when buying.
 
 “There has been a rise in NTPC’s power generation capacity and the cost of power is also lower. The private sector is also ahead of GSECL when it comes to electricity purchases according to the GERC merit order,” added a source in state government.
 
 The cost of power generation by major private sector plants in the state is lower and hence they are giving tough competition to GSECL, which has seen power generation at its plants go down.
