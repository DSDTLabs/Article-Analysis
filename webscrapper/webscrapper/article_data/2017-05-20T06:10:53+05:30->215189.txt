KANPUR: In a perfect filmy ending, ' ' and her 'abducted' lover announced on Friday that they decided to tie the knot. The case of abduction against the accused and bride-to-be   was also dropped after the family of the original bride, Bharti, chose a compromise instead.

 “We spoke to Ashok (the groom). He knew Varsha for eight years and was unhappy with his proposed marriage to Bharti. However, since his parents were adamant, he gave in,“ Maudaha Kotwali inspector AK Singh said.
 
 “Initially, the groom's father came to us with a complaint and an FIR was regis tered against Varsha under Section 363 of the IPC. But before we could initiate action, they again arrived at the police station and reached a compromise. Since the families resolved the issue amicably, the complaint has now been withdrawn. The two have now decided to marry,“ Singh added.
 
 In order to avoid complications, Ashok will be produced in the court of chief judicial magistrate, Hamirpur, where his statement would be recorded on Saturday, the inspector added.
 
 Varsha had 'abducted' Ashok from his   pandal allegedly at gunpoint on May 15.
