JODHPUR:   have been struggling hard to get the hardcore  ,  , speak up about the two firing incidents in Jodhpur that took place early on March 17. Bishnoi was brought to Jodhpur from   two days back on production warrant and is currently under 8-day police remand.

 Without disclosing the details of the interrogation with Bishnoi so far, police said that he was not cooperating and trying to avoid questions related to the incident, his local contacts as well as the names behind this incident.
 
 “He was not cooperating in the investigation and avoiding questions with regard to the firing incidents,“ said an official, adding that he was tight-lipped about the entire network behind the incident. Though, one of the local contacts,  , has been arrested by the police after he surrendered on Thursday, but no further lead has been obtained in the case so far.
 
 Vishnu was one of the shooters who had been spot ted in the video footages of firing and had been absconding. Similarly, one Om Prakash, a gang member, is also wanted by the police as an important link in the matter.
 
 Amid all the cluelessness, fresh Facebook update by Lawrence Bishnoi has rattled the police. In his FB update, Bishnoi is seen with ear plugs, donning a t-shirt with the photo of martyr Bhagat Singh, which he was wearing all through Wednesday, while being produced in the court by Jodhpur police.
 
 Police, however, claim that it was not possible, but the picture showed him in the custody of Jodhpur police.
 
 “This is not possible at all as he has been under tight police security where nobody could reach him. It it possible that somebody else has been operating his FB account and updating his profile,“ said an official.
