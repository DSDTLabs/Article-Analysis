NEW DELHI: In a stunning blow to the  , the   on Saturday clinched a thumping majority to emerge victorious in the hill state of Uttarakhand.

 Defying most exit polls, which predicted a photo finish between the BJP and Congress and the grim possibility of a hung House, the saffron party captured the lion's share of 54 seats in the 70-member state assembly. 
 
 On the other hand, the ruling Congress was left red-faced with a meagre 14 seats to their name. This is a sharp drop from the 32 seats the Congress won in the 2012 state assembly election.
 
 Turbulence within the Congress and the anti-incumbency factor against chief minister   seems to have worked in the BJP's favour. In May last year, nine senior Congress leaders, including former chief minister Vijay Bahuguna, had defected to the BJP, triggering a constitutional crisis in the state.
 
 Uttarakhand has never given any party a consecutive term in the government in its 16 years of existence.
 
 Rawat, who had predicted a "minimum of 45 seats" for the Congress, was trailing in both constituencies of Kiccha and Haridwar Rural.
 
 Victory will taste all the more sweet for the BJP since it did not field a chief minister candidate in Uttarakhand and relied on   magic to swing voters in their favour.
 
 Both the Congress and the BJP contested in all the 70 constituencies while the   (BSP) fielded 69 candidates.
