Nagpur: A 23-year-old girl Tanuja Rahangdale, whose marriage was scheduled to take place in May, died mysteriously on Saturday. The family members claimed that the girl suffered head injuries after falling off a cot. The police conducted post mortem on Sunday. Tanuja, a resident of Gadikar Layout, was rushed to a private hospital and then taken to Government Medical College (GMCH) after family members spotted her on the floor.  The family members claimed that Tanuja had felt giddy before falling. She suffered head injuries. The girl breathed her last while undergoing treatment. The family members have ruled out any foul play in Tanuja’s death and claimed that it was an accident.  Meanwhile, forensic experts have indicated that Tanuja’s death could be due to poisoning.
