PATNA: Altogether 5,147 persons from Bihar have so far registered for   pilgrimage this year. The number has reduced considerably from 6,983 haj pilgrims from the state last year. Bihar has got a quota of 10,000 haj pilgrims.

 
 The combined effect of withdrawal of haj subsidy and the imposition of 18% GST on air travel has resulted in an increase of about Rs15,000 to Rs60,000 in expenses (depending on the embarkation point) compared to last year, Haj   chairman and   member Chaudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser told mediapersons here on Tuesday. He said although the services provided by the haj committee has been exempted from GST, it is levied on air travel, which is a significant portion of the expenses borne by the pilgrims.
 
 “Haj pilgrimage has always been exempted from service tax as the service provided by the specified organization in respect of a religious pilgrimage is facilitated by the central government under a bilateral agreement. But with the withdrawal of subsidy and imposition of fresh 18% GST, it has resulted in a steep hike in air expenditure. Where economy and business class passengers have to pay 5% and 12% GST respectively, haj pilgrims have to shell out 18% GST for travelling by a chartered flight. Many people have already started cancelling their pilgrimage programme on account of such steep increase,” Kaiser said.
 
 He said it is a matter of concern that cost on haj has been increasing every year, as most of the pilgrims belong to lower and middle classes. Kaiser has written to a letter to PM   to exempt the haj pilgrims from paying 18% GST on airfare.
 
 Those who undertook the haj pilgrimage under the Green category had to pay Rs2,38,400 in 2017 and Rs2,17,150 in 2016. The cost has now increased to Rs2,77,800. Pilgrims opting for   category would have to pay Rs2,43,650 this year, compared to Rs2,05,000 in 2017 and Rs1,83,250 in 2016, he said. 
 
 Under the Green category, a pilgrim is provided with an accommodation within one kilometre from Haram and Kaaba, the focal points of the pilgrimage. The pilgrims under the Azizia category are accommodated in Azizia city or similar localities within about 7-8km from Haram. A paid bus service to Haram is provided to the pilgrims of this category.
 
 An official related to haj committee affairs said May 23 is the last date to submit second instalment of the amount for haj. Haj operations will start on July 12. The flight schedule for departure from Gaya has not been finalised yet.
