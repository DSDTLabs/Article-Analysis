Chandigarh: A Moradabad native, Sajid, has been held guilty of murdering his wife at Daria village here on January 18, 2015, because he suspected her to be unfaithful.

 District and sessions judge Balbir Singh delivered the sentence on Wednesday, convicting Sajid under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The quantum of sentence will be pronounced on July 31. Complainant Anisha, in whose house the   had happened, had told police that Sajid and his wife, Sabia, had moved to Chandigarh for the man’s treatment, and about 18 months before murdering his wife, he had tried to kill himself by consuming poison.
 
 Anisha used to sleep in the verandah outside her tenants’ room. The morning after the crime, when the couple didn’t come out for long, she knocked at the door for long and then got in to find Sabia lying on the bed. She nudged her but got no response. Anisha turned on the lights to find blood all over the bed and Sabia lying there with her throat slit. She couldn’t find Sajid anywhere and so she called the neighbours and police.
 
 She stated in the first-information report (FIR) that the couple had not been getting along well, since Sajid used to doubt Sabia’s character, and over this, had even tried to commit suicide. Police recovered the blood-stained murder weapon—an axe—from the room. It seemed that the woman had also been thrashed.
 
 Sabia was moved to the Sector-32 Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where she was declared brought dead. Police, later, arrested Sajid.
