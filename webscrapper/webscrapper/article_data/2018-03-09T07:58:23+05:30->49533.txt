CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court has become strict against motorcycles that have modified silencers for backfire blast. It has asked police for the address, names, and other details of anyone caught driving these noise machines, so that they could be made party to a case.

 These directions came here on Thursday, based on a public-interest petition for the stricter implementation of a rule against modified motorcycles. The high court observed that a lesson would teach the offenders how to respect the rules. By the next hearing, it also wants the details of the mechanics who modify these motorcycles for the noise makers.
 
 The court has sought details of each traffic ticket issued on this count, and it has asked the   to continue catching the motorists who play loud music and blare horns. In an earlier hearing, the administration had submitted details of 315-odd traffic tickets issued this year for dead silencers and high-volume music players in the cabin. This data was till February 15.
 
 The petitioner, a Chandigarh resident, had submitted in the high court that motorcyclists continued to even remove the silencers from their vehicles to produce a jarring boom that scares passers-by and creates noise pollution. The petitioner submitted the modified bikes also had pressure horns for a shrill alarm. The petitioner has sought directions to the   for preventive measures such as a public-awareness campaign on the rules about modified motorcycles. Many bikers are unaware that altering a factory model is illegal under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
