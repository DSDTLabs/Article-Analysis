The first opportunity for me to   came at the age of 19 in my hometown of Udupi. As a young adult, my choices for candidates were influenced by my parents. But since then, I’ve taken the effort to get to know the candidates better, which is easy to do today because of the information available online. But social media can be a double-edged sword, because a lot of misinformation can be spread. It’s best to stay away from social media as we near election time, and instead rely on credible sources of information to form an opinion.

 Voting is the right thing to do in a functional democracy. Most people choose candidates based on the parties they are associated with, and not their agenda or track record. I believe it should be the other way around — if we choose candidates based on their virtues, the party with the most number of deserving candidates will come to power. Small victories will ensure the right party comes to power.
 
 On May 12, I will be in Udupi to cast my vote. As a celebrity, I have a responsibility to vote and ask people to do the same. Two days ago, we were to start a schedule for   in   and had decided to give a day off to the crew on election day, but we had concerns if just a day’s off would deter them from voting. So, we have pushed the shoot schedule. That’s how important we feel it is.
