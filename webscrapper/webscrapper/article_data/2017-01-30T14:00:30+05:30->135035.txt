BHUBANESWAR: Giving a boost to organ donation, thousands of students from   and colleges will pledge their organs at 10 different places across the state on Monday. The Body and   Initiative (BODI), started by a group of volunteers with support of several universities of the state, has launched an awareness campaign in different educational institutes in this regard. 

 "There is a huge shortage of organs in India leading to large number of deaths every day. We have launched a campaign for organ donation and around 3,000 people have pledged their organs. On Monday we are expecting pledge by 5,000 people," said Pravas Acharya, president of the initiative. 
 
 Official sources said, around 7,000 brain dead cases are reported in the state every year, but due to lack of pledge their organs can't be retrieved. "We want to motivate the youth for organ donation," said Acharya adding, "We have also been urging the state government to improve infrastructure in different hospitals for retrieval of organs."
