BENGALURU:  ' former head of global immigration  , who filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against the company last year, said he plans to arbitrate his claims.

 A federal judge in Texas recently ruled that Green could not use the public court system to deal with the charge. The judge said he could only arbitrate his claims, considering that such a process was mandated by his employment contract.
 
 Green had filed the lawsuit in June last year, alleging that Infosys favoured employees who are of South Asian and of Indian descent. He alleged that Infosys deprived him of an equal right to work based on his race and that it retaliated against him because he complained about race discrimination. Infosys had terminated Green's employment on June 28, 2016.
 
 In a response to TOI, Green said he would use the arbitration mechanism offered by his employment contract. This involves the appointment of an arbitrator, often a retired judge, to settle the dispute. Green alleged that "non-Indians have an extremely limited (if any) chance of a career prospect no matter how accomplished, talented or proven."
