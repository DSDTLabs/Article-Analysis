CHANDIGARH: The city's all-India ranking in sanitation, which declined from 11 to 22 recently, is going to slip further, since as the municipal corporation is "deaf to feedback from the residents", as was alleged a stormy meeting of   (Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh) here on Sunday on various issues. 

 The residents said that as public participation in the decision-making and maintenance of sectors had declined, the city was destined to performing badly on the national level. Foswac general secretary J S Gogia said the MC had an excuse when it came to sanitation-that it was short of adequate manpower to get the city clean.
 
 He said that city's slipping from number 2 to 11, and now to an anticipated 22 in all-India ranking was because there was no participation of the resident welfare associations in maintaining the city. He suggested that the civic authorities should empower the RWAs for monitoring the sanitation work. 
 
 S C  , general secretary of   in  , said: "Recently, the MC proposed a street vendors' market in our area without consulting the residents. The site does not have proper parking space." Sector-8 RWA president   objected to the voter list prepared by Foswac. Referring to the voter list of Sector 40-B and D, he said the number of registered voters was far less that the count of actual voters. 
 
 "In Sector 40-B, there are 200 voters, but Foswac has registered only eight, while in 40-D, we have 300 voters against only six who are registered," he said.  , president of the Federation of Social Welfare Associations of Sector 40, also objected to the voter list, which led to heated arguments on the issue of election.
