PILIBHIT: A woman has moved a petition in the   with a plea that a CB-CID (crime branch-crime investigation department) probe be ordered into the murder of her husband on the intervening night between November 13 and 14, 2017, near Nisra village under Jahanabad police station in Pilibhit district.
  
  A divisional bench of Justice   and Justice Ashok Kumar has directed UP government to give a reply on the matter on March 19, said petitioner Rampyari Devi’s lawyer Mohit Singh.
  
  Rampyari Devi, a resident of Hussain Nagar village under Jahanabad police station, and widow of Moti Ram, told TOI that her husband was shot dead after he left for Lucknow on the evening of November 13. His body was found November 14 by police.
  
  Initially, police did not act, Rampyari alleged. She said she had to approach the CM’s ‘janata darbar’ in Lucknow on December 12 for the police to act.
  
  She said her husband’s younger brother, Chhote Lal, lodged an FIR in the matter naming five persons — Pyare Lal, Mangli Prasad, Mehendra Pal, Bhoora and Umesh Chandra of the same village — as accused. However, police arrested Chhote Lal and two other persons, Aqil Shah and Phool Singh, of Sardar Nagar village, and sent them to jail for the murder.
  
  In fact, superintendent of police Kalanidhi Naithani held a press conference on December 21 and said Chhote Lal had hired a contract killer, Aqil Shah, for Rs 50,000 to kill Moti Ram. Shah had shot Moti Ram dead with the help of Phool Singh.
  
  Naithani had said that Chhote Lal had tried to frame Pyare Lal, Mangli Prasad, Mehendra Pal, Bhoora and Umesh Chandra because they had accused Chhote Lal of murder in another case. As a result, Chhote Lal was had been sentenced to life imprisonment by the district and sessions court. However, he managed to get bail from the high court.
  
  Rampyari claimed that the relations between Chhote Lal and her husband were cordial and her brother-in-law had falsely been implicated in her husband’s murder.
