 All the accused were riding on a single two-wheeler which had no registration number. 
 
 First, the accused arrived at a garden near Sorathiyavadi Circle at 8.30pm, where Vishal Patadiya (26) stood chatting with his two friends — Dharmesh Ahir and Ghanshyam Prajapati. First, they went past him and then taking a U-turn they approached him. “The accused asked Vishal as to why he was talking nonsense on the road. When Vishal said he was merely chatting with his friends, one of the accused flashed out a knife and stabbed him in his buttocks,” said an official from Bhaktinagar police station where the case in this connection has been registered. 
 
 “The assailants also tried to attack Dharmesh and Ghanshyam, and when they fled from the spot, they chased them on their two-wheeler. Two of the women in the gang hurled abuses at Dharmesh and Ghanshyam,” said the official. 
 
 After attacking Vishal, the accused went to a lane adjoining Kevadavadi main road where Yash Tilala (22) was seated in his car. “They stopped near his car and started abusing him, accusing him of rash driving. Sensing trouble when Yash pulled up the window glasses, one of the attackers smashed his window glasses—the side glass and the rear window glass—with the knife handle. They also threatened to kill Yash before fleeing from the spot,” the official said. 
 
 Though the identity of the accused is yet to be ascertained, they have been captured in one of the CCTV footage grabs installed at a shop between Sorathiyavadi Circle and Kevadavadi. “The CCTV footage shows two of the youths dressed in Pathani, considering which we may assume them to be Muslims. It appears that they had consumed some intoxicant before going on the rampage,” added the official.
