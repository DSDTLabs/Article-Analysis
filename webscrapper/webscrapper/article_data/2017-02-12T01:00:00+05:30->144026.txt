While time leaps have forced many disgruntled TV actors to quit shows, they have turned out to be a stroke of good fortune for  . After playing the grown-up Gunjan in 'Ek Veer Ki Ardaas… Veera', and the adult Vrushali in ' ', she is all set to score a hat-trick with TV show ' '. The actress has been roped in to play the grown-up Manu (played by  ), the show’s central character, post a 10-year time leap. 
Like the child artiste, she too will be seen disguised as a boy. “I auditioned as a boy, in a kurta borrowed from my brother and a kada. I am excited about this role, as one rarely gets to play such unconventional characters. I am working on my body language and voice. I want to be known for my work and not my beauty,” she says.

So, I didn’t know how to handle the situation. She was the protagonist and the privileged one on the set. Situations were quite provoking, but I tried my best to avoid the conflict for long. I didn’t face any such problem during 'Suryaputra Karn'. I have realised that clashes are inevitable when two actresses are working in a show,” she signs off.
