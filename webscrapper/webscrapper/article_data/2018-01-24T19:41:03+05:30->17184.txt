HYDERABAD:A 14-year-old boy, son of a watchman, allegedly hacked social media accounts of   cricketer   and sent ‘I Love You’ messages to the pacer’s friends. The incident came to light after the cricketer from   lodged a complaint with cyber crime sleuths on Tuesday.

 Mohammed Siraj realised about the hacking on Monday after several of his friends contacted him about the ‘I Love You’ messages sent from his   account.
 
 
 
 The pace bowler, who recently made his début in T20 cricket matches played against New Zealand, then approached the Cyber Crime sleuths of the Hyderabad commissionerate. The social media accounts of Siraj, including his Facebook, Instagram, Gmail and Twitter, were hacked, a Cyber Crime official said.
 
 After receiving the complaint, police immediately swung into action and tracked the details of the hacker. They discovered that the hacker replaced the cricketer’s password with his own password and checked the details. “The hacker gave a cell phone number as the new password to access social media accounts of Siraj. We obtained the details of the cell phone number and realised that it was being used by a 14-year-old boy from Begumpet, who is the son of a watchman,” an investigating officer said.
 
 Cops went to the boy’s house and questioned him in the presence of his family members. A case was also registered under the IT Act. During preliminary investigation, police discovered that the boy’s brother and the cricketer were friends. The investigators were questioning the teenager to know how he managed to hack the accounts of Siraj.
