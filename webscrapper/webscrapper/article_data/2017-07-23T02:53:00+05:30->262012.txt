 Regarding cases filed against licensed liquor dealers, SP Pola Raju said, “Our aim is to go to the root of the problem and destroy the nexus between the licensed suppliers and the belt-shop owners. I also wish to warn the licensed shop owners, that if the charges against them regarding supply of liquor to belt shops are proved, they will not only be punished but also lose their license.”
