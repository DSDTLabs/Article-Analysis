MUMBAI: Private schools are planning to approach chief minister   about a new order, which allows the state education department to act against the staff of private, unaided schools if they are caught taking a bribe.

 According to a government resolution, issued last week, the state has entrusted the directorate of education with taking action against teaching or non-teaching staff of unaided schools if there is evidence of misconduct according to the Prevention of Corruption Rules, 1988. Earlier, under section 19 of the rules, the department could take action only against the teaching and non-teaching staff of a government or aided school. Private schools were exempt.
 
 Prashant Redij from the Mumbai School Principals' Association said they would be writing to Fadnavis to protestthe change. "Unaided schools don't get money from the state so why should they have any authority over our staff? They should continue to monitor only their own schools or those which receive money," he said.
 
 School managements are also worried they will lose their administrative autonomy. "School managements have their own way of disciplining staff in case of a problem. This power should remain with us so the school can function smoothly," said a school trustee.
 
 However, activists said the change could benefit parents. "Sometimes, schools don't take action in spite of repeated complaints about donations and fees. In such cases, parents have nowhere to go. This way, they would at least be able to look for relief from the local education officers," said Jayant Jain from the NGO Forum For Fairness in Education.
