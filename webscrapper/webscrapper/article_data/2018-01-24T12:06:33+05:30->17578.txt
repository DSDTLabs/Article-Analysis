CHENNAI: Five days after the   government increased   fares in the state, the   on Wednesday refused to interfere in the issue noting that it is the policy decision of the government, in which the courts cannot intrude. 

 However, the first bench headed by Chief Justice Indira Banerjee directed the government to take immediate steps to display   charts in all the government and private buses, prominently. 
 
 "There is no doubt that any price hike, including the bus fare hike, would affect the people. However, fair fixation is a matter of policy, in which the high court cannot interfere," the bench said and disposed of the plea. 
 
 The court passed the order on two separate pleas moved by advocate George William and V Munikrishnan of Tiruvannamalai seeking roll back of the hike. 
 
 William said hike was unjustified, arbitrary and had been made without following procedures. He wanted the court to interfere immediately by passing an interim order restraining the government from collecting the revised fair which “adversely affected the people and student community.”
 
 Munikrishnan alleged that the state government had been spending huge public money for achieving it political goal and now shifted the burden on to people claiming financial crisis in transport corporations. “The fare hike is like adding fuel to the fire, when people are already put to great suffering by the GST and demonetisation," he said. 
 
 The Tamil Nadu government increased bus fares on January 19. Minimum fare of Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses in Chennai has been increased from Rs 3 to Rs 5, and the maximum from Rs 14 to Rs 23. In case of non-metros, the hike was in the range of Rs 3 to Rs 19. 
 
 Protests are being held in the state demanding rollback of the fare hike. The protesters include college students.
