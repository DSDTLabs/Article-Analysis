MUMBAI: The   (MHCC) on Thursday began hearing   and   from   residents. The ward, which covers parts of Bandra, Khar and Santacruz, is home to many listed heritage structures including the crosses on Bandra’s Carter Road, St Joseph’s Convent Complex, Our Lady of Mount Carmel church, railway cottages on SV Road, St Andrews and St Peter’s churches on Hill Road, Mount Mary Church and Bandra railway station. 

 Dinesh Afzulpurkar, MHCC chairman, said as they have almost completed the review of heritage structures across the city, they decided to begin the hearings for wards in the western suburbs. “We started with H-west ward, but there were citizens from other wards too and we heard them too,” he added. 
 
 Residents from Pali Gaothan East Indian Residents Association also attended the hearing. Neil Pereira of the association said they have urged that the gaothon be retained as a precinct. “With the BMC granting permission to builders without thought, highrises have been coming up on the boundaries of the gaothon, which is not only destroying the identity of the place but also inconviencing residents.” NGO Watchdog Foundation members demanded that all crosses be declared heritage as they are centuries old. tnn
