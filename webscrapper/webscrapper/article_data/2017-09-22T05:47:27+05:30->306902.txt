Following the order, the teacher’s photograph, employee code and contact details will be displayed on the school notice boards, using which the students and parents can contact them if they are found absent during their scheduled classes. 
 
 “Some school teachers have been misusing the services and don’t show up for the remote postings. It was noticed that they simply mark their attendances and draw their salaries,” said a senior education officer. 
 
 Also, the education department will provide vehicles to block education officers (BEO) to carry out surprise checks in the schools. Each school will be inspected at least once a month.
