Criticising the economic policies of the BJP-led union government, V  , scientific advisor to former president A P J Abdul Kalam said that a country cannot develop if it was merely depending on the tax money of its citizens. 

 Speaking at the birth anniversary meeting of the former President in Trichy, Ponraj, who has forayed into politics by floating a new party, said that scientifically-driven policies can only ensure the development of a country, which was the dream of former president A P J Abdul Kalam. 
 
 “More than 3 lakh small and medium scale industries have perished owing to the ‘policies’ of the union government to trace black money. This sector alone gives employment to 4.3 crore people,” said Ponraj while terming the demonetisation as a failure. 
 
 Quoting former president Kalam, Ponraj said that a country can only be deemed as developed if its GDP growth is maintained at 10 percent for 10 consecutive years. Instead of ensuring growth, the government is dividing the country in the name of caste and religion. Ponraj distributed Tulsi saplings as part of the 86th birth anniversary celebrations organised by A P J Abdul Kalam Pasumai India Nambagam and Kalam Nanbaragal Iyakkam, Trichy.
