MUMBAI: Lenders to   expect far more aggressive quotes from Numetal and   in the second round of bidding. Banks are also not ruling out new entrants, which could make the process more competitive.

 This month the court-appointed resolution professional, who is managing Essar Steel in the ongoing insolvency proceedings, ruled the two bids by Numetal and ArcelorMittal as invalid. Russia’s VTB Bank-promoted Numetal’s bid was turned down because of the presence of   — the younger son of   promoter   — as a shareholder in the company. ArcelorMittal’s bid also did not qualify because the company was a promoter of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron — two defaulting companies.
 
 Both these bidders are expected to get regularised in the second round of bidding. VTB has said that it is prepared to drop Ruia from Numetal if that was a precondition for it to qualify for the bid. Meanwhile, ArcelorMittal has exited the loss-making Uttam Galva and KSS Petron.
 
 “Now that the bidders know how keen the other group is to acquire the company, we feel that they might submit higher bids,” said a public sector bank official. “In the second round, the focus will be on price as bidders are expected to have sorted out the eligibility part. Since the negotiations will be only with the company offering the higher quote, both will have to try and outbid the other,” he added.
 
 Lenders are also not ruling out new entrants other than Numetal and ArcelorMittal. A final call on the fresh bids will be taken in a meeting of lenders on Wednesday.
