PUNE:   from Maval, Gajanan Babar joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in the presence of chief minister   and   on Wednesday.

 Babar was the first MP from   and was denied Sena nomination for 2014 Lok Sabha elections due to which he quit the party. He was two-term MLA from Haveli assembly constituency and also three-term corporator of Sena in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). 
 
 His sister-in law Sharada Babar is a Sena corporator from Ward 8 — Vidyanagar in Chinchwad. His brother Madhukar Babar is a former Sena corporator. Babar family’s stronghold is Mohannagar and the surrounding area in Chinchwad. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Babar said, “I was not active in politics for past two years after the Shiv Sena denied Lok Sabha ticket to me. Instead of sitting home, I thought of joining the BJP. I received many opportunities and got elected to many posts until Sena supremo Bal Thackeray was alive. I had been in Sena for 45 years.”
 
 On the BJP’s part, Bapat said no assurance has been given to Babar for joining the BJP. “We do not give any assurances to anyone,” he said.
 
 Chinchwad BJP MLA Laxman Jagtap said, “Babar does not only enjoy huge support in Pimpri Chinchwad, but also has a following in Satara district. His induction into the party fold will boost BJP’s strength.”
