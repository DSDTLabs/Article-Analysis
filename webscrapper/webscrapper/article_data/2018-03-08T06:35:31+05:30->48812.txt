KOLKATA: Irrigation department has undertaken a massive renovation, repair and upgrade of dams, barrages and reservoirs in the state. The cost will be to the tune of Rs 100 crore and each barrage has been allocated Rs 20 crore to carry out the repair work.

 Five barrages — Bankura barrage,   reservoir, Massanjore dam, Tilpara barrage and   barrage — have been identified for the project. Manual gates will be replaced with automated ones.
 
 “We’ll complete work within the next three years. Renovation at some sites has started already,” said irrigation minister  . He said the repairs are being done on a war footing as many of them are quite old with manual operating mechanism. Most of these barrages belong to the Raj era and their gates often malfunction.
 
 “As these gates are manually operated, problems over distribution of irrigation water occurs and flood control is also hampered,” said a source. “With the automated gates in place, the barrages can be monitored continuously on computer screens. Also, there will be almost no possibility of gate malfunctioning,” he added.
