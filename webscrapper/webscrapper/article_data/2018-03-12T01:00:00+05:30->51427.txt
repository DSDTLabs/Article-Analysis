 Talking about the success of the film, Bhushan says, “The success of 'SKTKS' at the box office is testimony to what happens when two teams collaborate on a project which is fuelled by passion and has the desire to create good content. We are hopeful that with Luv’s creative guidance and meticulous craftsmanship, we will continue to give the audience many more cluster-breaking films in the future.”
 Luv adds, “I am grateful to the audience who whole-heartedly believe in the kind of films I make. It is great to partner with someone like Bhushan who has shown faith in my vision from the start and its reassuring to also have someone like Ankur Garg (producer at Luv Films) to walk shoulder-to-shoulder with me. We are committed to give the audience more such content that entertains.” Elated with the success of their recent release, Ankur says, “Magic happens when the teams involved on a film come together with a single goal of making a good product which is engaging and relevant. I think that’s what Luv Films and T-Series achieved with 'Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety'. We hope to make this collaboration stronger with our upcoming films” 
 
 An announcement of their future projects is expected soon.
