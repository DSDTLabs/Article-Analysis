Salem: Rain didn’t stop the members of the Joint Action Committee of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organisations-Government Employees’ Organisations (JACTTO-GEO) from staging a sit-in near the district collectorate, urging the state government to implement old pension scheme and seventh pay commission immediately.

 The JACTTO-GEO members had been protesting for the past couple of days against the government’s failure to look into their demands. On Wednesday, more than 800 teachers gathered near the collectorate to stage a sit-in. Suddenly, rain lashed the area but the teachers did not budge from the protesting venue.
 
 Meanwhile, a teacher identified as K Rathnavel, took alms from his fellow teachers wearing worn out dress. He said pension would secure the life of a government employee at the old age even if the deserts him/her. “We wanted to press the demand for pension and tell government how important it is to us by way of this begging act,” said P Govindan, high level committee member of JACTTO-GEO. He also urged the state government to invite them for a meeting at the earliest to address their demands.
