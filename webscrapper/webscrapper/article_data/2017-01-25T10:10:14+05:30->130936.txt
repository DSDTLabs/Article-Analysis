PATNA: Days before assembly polls in a few states where   is likely to become an election issue, Bihar CM and JD (U) president   on Tuesday reiterated that notebandi was a “bold step” against black money even as he demanded the Centre to share with the country how it benefited the country’s economy.
 
  Former JD-U national president  , a vocal opponent of notebandi, was on the dais when Nitish called it a bold step at least thrice.
  
  “We extended our in-principle support to the   as it was a brave initiative to curb black money and corruption. It was a good move and we continued to support it despite political rumours,” Nitish said at a function organised by party to commemorate former CM   on his birth anniversary.
  
  However, Nitish said, the Centre now must explain what benefits the notebandi has led to. “The Prime Minister had assured the country to wait for 50 days... Now 77 days have elapsed. We, therefore, demand from the PM to explain the benefits of notebandi,” the Bihar CM said, adding the Union budget should contain details of the notebandi’s effects.
  
  Nitish said many workers, especially those not in organised sector, lost jobs due to economic slowdown following demonetisation. They did not express much discontentment as they thought notebandi had a noble purpose. “The Union budget must also provide for compensation to these people,” he said.
  
  Earlier, a meeting of the party’s core committee on Monday night decided to continue the party’s support to notebandi. Held at the CM residence and chaired by Nitish, the meet however was of the opinion that the Centre needs to take more steps against black money.
  
  “We believe black money is a major issue. The Centre took a right decision to demonetise Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes. But we want it to also crack down on benami property and intensify its fight against black money,” said JD (U) spokesman K C Tyagi on Tuesday.
