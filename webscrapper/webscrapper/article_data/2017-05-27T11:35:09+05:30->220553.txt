JODHPUR: Textile and dying industrial units in Pali will resume functioning after eight months of closure. The   ( ) on Friday allowed conditional opening of these 578 units shut since October 3, last year.

 Considering the assurance of the respondents to comply with any direction passed by the tribunal, adverse effect on the employment and livelihood of the workers directly or indirectly dependent on the industries and prolonged closure resulting in the surreptitious and illegal dyeing and bleaching activities, the bench of the tribunal comprising Justice   and member B S   permitted the reopening of these industries. 
 
 Laying down various conditions, NGT has ordered to set up a monitoring committee comprising representatives of IIT, Central Pollution Control Board ( ) and Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) and submit a report on the next hearing. 
 
 “This committee will carry out inspections and surprise checks at the industries and Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) and will ensure disconnection of electricity where the industries do not have any consent to operate or they are not connected with CETP or do not have their own ETP,” said counsel for one of the respondents, Pali Water Pollution Control Treatment & Research Foundation Trust.
 
 Besides this, the tribunal has also directed to constitute a district-level task force, which will ensure that no industry functions illegally or in violation of the rules and norms for polluting industries and will also chart a surveillance mechanism as well as take punitive measures against defaulter units.
 
 NGT had ordered these polluting textile industrial units engaged in dyeing and printing of cloth to shut their operations on October 3 last year while hearing a petition moved by an environmental organization, Kissan Paryavaran Sangharsh Samiti.
 
 The untreated effluents of these units are since long polluting a seasonal river of the district, the   river, whose water feeds the  , which has severely affected the agriculture in the region and polluted the underground water beyond consumption. 
 
 Pursuant to the petition, NGT had ordered two dry inspections of all the 6 CETPs catering to 578 units by CPCB and RSPCB jointly, the reports of which had been submitted on October 26 last year and April 17 this year highlighting glaring deficiencies in functioning of the CETPs.
