PORVORIM: Negligence on the part of   police to clamp vehicles parked in the ‘No Parking’ zone near   on the   highway has been creating problems for commuters on the highway.

 With the first-of-its-kind shopping mall set up in Goa, there is a lot of rush witnessed, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, wherein a number of locals as well as tourists visit the mall. TOI observed that the customers visiting the mall were parking their vehicles in the no-parking zone and the police were turning a blind eye towards it.
 
 Speaking to TOI, an employee at the mall, who regulates shopper traffic, said that despite parking space being provided by the mall on a pay-parking basis, people are not using the facility and are parking in the no-parking zone. “We charge Rs 30 for four hours on Friday and Saturday, while on the other days, it is Rs 20,” said the employee. “There is also a lot of parking space opposite the mall, but some customers don’t want to park their vehicles there,” he said.
 
 When TOI asked police officials present as to why they were not clamping the vehicles, they said it was the duty of the traffic police to do so. “The fine is Rs 100, but we are reluctant to clamp the vehicles parked in the no-parking zone,” said a traffic policeman. When contacted, police inspector,   traffic cell, Salim Shaikh said that police are taking action against vehicles violating the no-parking zone. “We are clamping vehicles and are also issuing a fine of Rs 100,” he said.
