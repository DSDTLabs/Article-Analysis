PATNA: Crime against children in Bihar has increased 36% in the last five years (2012-2016), as per the   ( ) data released in November 2017.

 A total of 3,932 cases of crime against children were reported in 2016, compared to 1,917 in 2015, the data said. “The reason could be increased awareness level and improvement in reporting,” Sampurna Behura, director of programmes at   (BBA), a social movement started under Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation, said on Wednesday while addressing a state consultation on child protection in Bihar. State labour resources minister Vijay Kumar Sinha was also present.
 
 The meet was organized in association with   (BALSA). “Out of 87,000 children saved from all over the country in the last 20 years under the BBA movement, 76,000 were from Bihar. I think the state needs to sensitize the people about the schemes and programmes of the government. Until now, there has been an individualistic approach towards addressing these issues by the various departments involved in children related programmes. What is needed is to converge everything under one umbrella,” Behura said.
 
 The number of children becoming victims of sexual harassment and assault in 2016 in Bihar was 170, which was 73% of the total cases filed under the POCSO Act. Out of the persons trafficked in the state in 2016, 83% were below 18 years of age. 
 
 “It has been seen that the state governments have failed to properly impose various provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and 2015, including the establishment of child welfare committees, juvenile justice boards, special juvenile police units and homes for children in need of care and protection,” Behura said.
 
 BALSA member secretary Sunil Dutt Mishra said although there are various government laws to protect the children’s rights, there are many challenges too, both on a social as well as implementation level and need to be addressed.
