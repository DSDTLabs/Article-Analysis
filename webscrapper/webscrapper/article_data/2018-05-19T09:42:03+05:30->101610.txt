LOS ANGELES:   and   CEO   has for the first time revealed his concept for a personalised mass transit system or ‘Loop’ that will carry 16 people and travel at 240 km per hour for a fare of just $1 (Rs 68).

 
 The Tesla founder also unveiled the project details, including 2.7 miles (4.3 km) of tunnel that will run north to south parallel to the 405 freeway in Los Angeles, CNET reported.
 
 Musk, however, did not provide a time-line for his project that could get passengers from downtown to   (LAX) in eight minutes in a vacuum tube. The trip now can easily take more than an hour by car.
 
 Musk “envisions dozens to hundreds of small stations, about the size of a single or double car parking spot, to alleviate traffic at any one spot”. Musk was joined at the event by The   director Steve Davis.
 
 “It’s the only way we can think of to address the chronic traffic issues in major cities,” Musk said. These tunnels were not yet part of his cross-country ‘Hyperloop’ system, which would ferry people in tubes travelling at airline speeds at a much lower cost.
 
 Earlier, Musk hinted that he plans to link the hyperloop project under his startup The Boring Company with SpaceX's rockets to create a transportation system that may ferry people anywhere on Earth in less than an hour. The Boring Company is a tunnel construction company founded by Musk in late 2016. IANS
