NEW DELHI: A suspended constable and his friend, a former   mitra, have been arrested for thrashing and robbing a man in east Delhi’s Ghazipur. 
 
 
 The former constable was posted at the Shahdara police station and was suspended for misconduct in February. He has now been dismissed from service.
 
 Police said the victim, Tanseem, called them saying that two men posing as policemen had thrashed him and also took away his money. Soon, a police team reached the spot. DCP (east)   said the suspended constable, Ideesh, and the former police  , Jai Singh, were arrested. 
 
 A case under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing  ), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine a person) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of IPC was registered against the duo.
 
 Tanseem’s mother told TOI that she came to know of the incident when the police called her husband. “My husband works at Ghazipur and I had sent Tanseem to get Rs 4,000 from him as I had to buy a few household items. He collected the money and was coming back home when two men stopped him. They said they wanted to interrogate him,” said the mother, Ruksar.
 
 She added that the duo then took Tanseem to a public washroom, thrashed him and fled with the cash.
 
  Tasneem is an engineer and looking for a job at present.
