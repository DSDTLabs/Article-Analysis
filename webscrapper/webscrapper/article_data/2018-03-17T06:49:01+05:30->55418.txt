CHENNAI: Departmental action has been initiated against a government bus conductor in Chennai after a checking squad found a difference of 1 between the value of tickets sold by him and the amount collected. 

 K Siva, a conductor from   depot, said he had mistakenly given a new 2 coin instead of 1 to a passenger in a crowded   bus. Authorities, however, handed him a memo (a copy of which is with TOI) for not issuing a ticket to a passenger and for the collection falling short. The conductor has been instructed not to report to work until the inquiry was over. In a separate incident, a MTC driver from   depot was suspended for using mobile phone while driving based on a passenger's complaint.
