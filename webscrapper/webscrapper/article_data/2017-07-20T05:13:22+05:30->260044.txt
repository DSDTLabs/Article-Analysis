KOLKATA: Passengers of the 34417 Up   survived a scare after the   rammed into the buffers of platform 13 at Sealdah station on Wednesday morning. 

 At least 21 passengers suffered injuries — most of them after getting thrown off from the gates on to the platform due to the severe jolt. Some women were injured after the ladies’ compartment, second from the front, derailed and came in contact with another train on platform 14, nearly 4.5feet away. 
 
 Eastern Railway, which ordered an inquiry into the accident, said three persons received minor injuries and medical care was provided.   and guard   were suspended. Officials said prima facie, there was no technical problem with the rake and the accident occurred as Haque was unmindful. 
 
 Trains are supposed to enter terminating stations at speeds not exceeding 5km/hr. It was suspected that Haque didn’t control the speed and failed to judge the distance from the buffer while applying brakes. Biswas should also have alerted Haque of the fact that the train was moving too fast. 
 
 The train was re-railed at 12.13pm and moved to the car shed for inspection. By then, three pairs of local trains had to be cancelled but services in the Sealdah south section were maintained from other platforms. 
 
 “After the train entered the platform, I moved to the gate. There was a jolt as it stopped and I fell out,” said Garia resident  , who injured her knees and arms. 
 
 As the couplings of the derailed coach had snapped, it had to be towed by a locomotive. Services at platforms 13 and 14 resumed at 1.30pm after the tracks were checked for damage.
