Surat: Crime branch sleuths of the city police nabbed two men and recovered two country-made pistols and five cartridges worth Rs 20,500 from them here on Tuesday. The weapons had been brought by one of the accused from Rajasthan.

 Police arrested Manish alias Chhotu Ramnimvas Goswami (23), a native of Dholpur in Rajasthan living in Dindoli, and Jay alias Jayu Rajendra Bhindi (25), a resident of Mota Varachha, after they were found possessing two country-made pistols worth Rs 20,000 and five cartridges worth Rs 500. 
 
 Police kept a watch in Yogi Chowk in Kapodara on receiving specific information and nabbed Bhindi and recovered from him a country-made pistol and three cartridges.
