BAREILLY: In a respite to residents, the   (BDA) has decided to approve building layouts within 30 days, ending their long wait in receiving a clearance to go ahead with the construction of their premises.

  The decision came at a BDA board meeting chaired by divisional commissioner P V   and attended by its officials here on Saturday.
 
  Speaking with TOI, BDA secretary S P Singh said, “The meeting was aimed at finding ways to expedite approval granting process to building layouts submitted by residents, and it had been decided to set a 30-day deadline for the approval of residential buildings’ maps. Earlier, residents have to make several rounds to the BDA office to get their building plan approved. The process was troublesome and time-consuming. Now, they do not require doing all those things.”
 
  According to officials, BDA will soon undertake an eviction drive in  , where motor mechanics have set up unauthorised shops on the footpaths.
 
  The authority has, however, dropped its plan to develop a shopping complex on railways’ land in  . “BDA had proposed to develop a doubled-storey shopping complex over 11 acres of the   (RLDA), but the project hit a roadblock and was scrapped at the meeting,” added Singh.
 
  Earlier, BDA in a letter to the power department had asked not to give power connections to such residential buildings and commercial establishments which layouts were not approved. The authority had told power department officials to cross check all relevant documents before approving a power connection.
