LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh governor Ram Naik asked chief minister   on Sunday why absconding minister Gayatri  , who is accused of rape, was still in his cabinet. In a letter to Akhilesh, the governor said Prajapati, who is minister for transport, faced grave charges.

 “His continuation as minister raises serious questions on the constitutional and moral values of a democratic set-up,” Naik wrote. Sources said Naik pointed out that since Prajapati had defied the CM’s directive to surrender, it showed the cabinet in poor light. He hinted that action was warranted against the minister.
 
 Gayatri Prajapati, who is also the Samajwadi Party candidate from Amethi, was booked in a rape case on orders of the Supreme Court. Last week, a local court issued arrest warrants against him and six others for alleged rape and attempt to molest the survivor’s minor daughter.
 
 The governor pointed out that Prajapati has defied CM Akhilesh Yadav’s directive to surrender. The minister’s passport has been suspended while a lookout circular was issued against him to prevent him from going abroad. This is not the first time Prajapati is in the dock.
 
 Earlier, during his stint as minister for mining, he was dropped from the cabinet by Akhilesh after   ordered a   inquiry into rampant corruption in the mining department. Akhilesh, however, had to reinstate him at Mulayam Singh Yadav’s behest.
