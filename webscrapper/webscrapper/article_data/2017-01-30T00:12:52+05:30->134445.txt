When he set forth on his acting career,   was keen on carving a niche for himself as a silver screen hero. Destiny though, had other plans. After doing a couple of films in Sandalwood and Kollywood, Ammith made a foray into the small screen.
 “It was at a stage in my life when I wanted to do more challenging work and films were not able to fulfil that. That’s when Vinu Balanja, who is an acclaimed director in the   arena, gave me a call and asked if I wanted to give television a try. It was for the serial Chitte Hejje,” shares Ammith.
  He has gone on to star in seven popular daily soaps. “But I seem to have hit my peak as a small screen actor with my current serial   in which I play the lead villain opposite  . This project has brought me a huge fan following,” says Ammith, adding, “The other day, I was at an upmarket mall and an elite set walked up to me for a selfie. This has never happened earlier and I’m glad that TV is breaking new ground,” he says.
  And when fans tell him that his acting in Agnisakshi reminds them of Vajramuni, Ammith, needless to say, is overwhelmed. “I can’t imagine reaching his stature, but such talk is humbling to say the least,” he avers.
  Ammith has playing a mute character in Swati Mutthu, and a psycho in an earlier serial called Mynah.
