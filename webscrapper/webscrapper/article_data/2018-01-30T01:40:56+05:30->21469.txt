NEW DELHI: The much awaited   in the   on   of the Election Commission’s decision to   failed to take off on Monday, with the matter being  . 

 Last week justice Vibhu Bakhru had restrained EC from issuing any notification on bypolls in Delhi as he sought records to examine the poll body’s decision to disqualify the MLAs for holding office of profit. But on the very second hearing on Monday, justice Bakhru sent the petitions filed by the former lawmakers to the acting chief justice after the original complainant, advocate Prashant Patel sprung a surprise.
 
 Patel, on whose plea EC had recommended disqualification of the MLAs — which also received the presidential nod — produced an SC ruling of 2015 that asked all HC’s to ensure such matters involving a challenge to disqualification should be heard by “a bench of at least two judges”.
 
 The 2015 ruling authored by Justice J Chelameshwar also laid down that such matters “must be disposed of within a period of eight weeks from the date of initiation without fail”. Last week, EC too had relied on this judgment to argue that the petitions should be heard by a division bench instead of the single judge. Senior advocate K V Vishwanathan, appearing for some of the former AAP MLAs, strongly opposed Patel’s plea and argued that as per the current HC roster the petitions should be heard by him since the SC ruling has not yet resulted in change of roster in Delhi HC.
 
 The court, however, while going through the SC findings, observed that the reasoning was clear with regard to hearing of the matter by a division bench. HC was hearing petitions filed by eight AAP MLAs challenging the Centre’s notification, disqualifying 20 of them for holding office of profit. Three more approached the court on Monday whose petitions will be tagged with the earlier ones.
