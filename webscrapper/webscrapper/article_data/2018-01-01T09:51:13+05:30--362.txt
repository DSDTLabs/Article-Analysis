This couple’s mission is to make India a spit-free country. Meet   Raja and her husband,  . Their target is to reach out to maximum districts by 2020 with this goal. They believe it is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men. So, they are conducting workshops in schools and discussing ways with the young generation to attain the objective of a spit-free country.

 Priti said, “In 2015, we decided to engage school children in correcting adults in their own house and in vicinity to have disease-free streets in Pune. If we tell adults to stop  , it will become an ego issue for them. So, we took the backward route of training youngsters and spreading the message through homes.”
 
 It took almost two years to hear positive stories from municipal schools’ children about their campaign working. Priti said, “It’s a slow start but the results are coming. We are telling children to approach people and tell them to stop spitting, but with a smile.”
 
 Rajas have been targeting municipal, transport and other public sector employees though audio-visual, social media and talk shows. Recently, about 170 management students and their professors joined the campaign and formed a human chain on platform number 1 of Pune railway station.
 
 They also performed skits and street plays to bring awareness about the cleanliness. A war cry skit was performed simultaneously on all the platforms of Pune railway station.
 
 Rajas have proposed to schools to make pouches or tissues in case anyone has the urge to spit. Efforts are also being made to inspire the civic administration to provide spittoons. They have started engaging corporates in the mission, too.
 
 Priti said, “It is necessary to convince people politely. The aim is create a goodness circle. The goodness stories will inspire everyone to do the same. When goodness attains its power, the effect will not be anything less than better human beings, better society and a better country.”
