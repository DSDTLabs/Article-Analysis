BENGALURU: What started as a blog in 2009 is today a website offering inspiring stories, be it lighting villages with solar lamps or finding jobs for the differently abled. One such story published on The   in 2016 will be incorporated in the   ( ) class 8 syllabus. 

  Started by city-based couple   and Dhimant Parekh, The Better India focuses on 'solution-based journalism', championing positive causes and real-life heroes who have been able to bring about change in their communities. 
 
 From the next academic session, approximately 20 lakh CBSE students will get to read about how poachers turned protectors of the rich ecosystem and bird population of   in Odisha. Written by Gangadharan Menon, a wildlife enthusiast, the story about 'Saving Chilika', is one of community engagement and realization of a person's place in the world. After realizing the folly of his actions, one poacher and his band of "dirty dozen" in the 1980s took a pledge in the local temple to not hunt a single migratory bird in the area again. 
 
  
 
 
  The rapid poaching of birds and other ecological changes were destroying the flora of the lake until citizens stepped up to fight the menace. Working with wildlife experts, the community educated itself about the various migratory birds and managed to successfully preserve the lake, making it an ecotourism haunt. 
 
  According to Parekh, adopting such stories into the school curriculum will inspire children from a young age. "It's encouraging when developments like these happen. Many of the stories we publish have a positive impact, and this is one of them. A teacher from Srinagar told us she prints our stories and takes them to class to share them with students," he said.
