NOIDA: Only eight projects were registered on the UP Rera website on Wednesday , the day it was launched, but some 15,000 homebuyers did not waste any time and made good use of the complaints section on the site to vent their frustration. The rush was such that by the end of the day the UP government introduced a Rs 1,000 fee to lodge complaints.
