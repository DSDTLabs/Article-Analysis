Emma   says she was scared her 'Beauty and The Beast' co-star   would break her foot while practising for the film's iconic waltz sequence. 

 The 26-year-old actress says she was 'slightly terrified' an accident might take place during the rehearsals of the titular song.
 
  
  
 "Dan was essentially wearing steel-capped stilts. I was slightly terrified my foot was going to get broken or we were going to end up in a heap on the floor. So it had an extra edge to it," says Watson. 
 
 But the actress says it was a great way to develop a good working relationship with the actor, who plays Beast in the   movie. 
 
 "It was actually a really good pre-film bonding. We got to know each other and learned to trust each other. I would recommend all couples go and dance together, stamp on each other's toes, be completely off-beat. It's perfect," says the actress.
