PANAJI: While plans of having an iconic viewing tower atop the new   were earlier announced by Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, work on the design has begun by the Parisian firm, Ingerop. However, as per the brief provided by the ministry to the firm, the new   bridge will get not one, but two viewing towers, with a height of 125 metres each.

 
  
 
 If all goes as planned, the towers will be open to visitors by the end of 2020, officials said. They’re being designed to house two floors each. The viewing area is expected to be made of glass for a seamless viewing experience.
 
 “Once Ingerop’s designs are ready, they will be sent to Dewai Chen of Shanghai Tonggang Bridge Technology Co Ltd in China, for tweaking. The final drawings will then be sent to the Union ministry for road transport and highways for its approval. Work on the two towers will begin after this, the cost of which will be known once the designs are ready,” said vice-president (structures) for Dilip Buildcon Ltd, Atul Joshi.
 
 As per the ministry’s brief to Ingerop, the design of the towers is to be unique and unlike the shape of any existing ones in the world.
 
 A large parking area will be created on the banks of River Zuari, below the existing bridge, on the Agasaim end. Dilip Buildcon’s temporary offices are presently located on this land. Visitors will be able to walk from this parking area towards the base of the towers, where high-speed elevators will take 10 to 20 persons to the upper floors at a time. The walkway over the Zuari river will be approximately 140 metres in length.
