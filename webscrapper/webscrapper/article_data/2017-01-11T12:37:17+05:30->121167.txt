THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After waiting 45-minutes for his turn to speak, chief minister   walked out of a south Indian development summit, organised by a  , in Chennai on Tuesday. 

 Sources told TOI that Vijayan, who was scheduled to speak soon after the inaugural address by Union minister Venkaiah Naidu, had to first let Andhra Pradesh chief minister   speak before him. Though he waited for 30 minutes - the time given for Naidu's speech - there was no hint that Naidu would wind up his address. Vijayan soon left the forum in a jiffy.
 
 Sources said that Vijayan had to attend the 28th national conference of All India Bank Employees Association in Kochi and he had to leave the venue to reach the conference on time. Last month, the chief minister had left a function organized by the state police in Kochi without giving the inaugural address as there was protocol violation and inappropriate behaviour from a section of organizers. 
 
 During his initial days as chief minister, Vijayan had cut short his speech at University College after the welcome speech lasted 45 minutes, upsetting the programme schedule. tnn
