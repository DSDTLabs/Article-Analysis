Dharamshala: The Congress government in Himachal Pradesh is all set to go for cashless transactions at transport and ration depots of the state. While the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) went cashless from Wednesday onwards, ration depots would take the step from April 1.

 Minister for civil supply and transport GS Bali, talking to media persons here, said it would not put any extra cost on customers. He said they had approached the Centre after demonetization to help departments go cashless, but nothing came from their end. “So, this initiative has been taken by the state government itself,” he said. 
 
 “HRTC went cashless from today. Our drivers and conductors have been trained and some of them are undergoing training,” he said.
 
 The minister was accompanied by head of HDFC Bank, Naveen Puri, the institution roped in for the implementation of the same. “We are going to ask the Centre to compensate us for this. Though the charges by the bank for this are only 0.60%, these would be cut too,” he said.
 
 Rural areas are not going to be touched in the first phase, he said. “”We will go for cashless transactions in urban areas, on interstate routes, and for luxury and super-luxury buses only right now. There are about 200 buses to get start with this,” he said.
 
 Bali said that after 20 days, digital ration card scheme would also start in the state. Of the total 289 ration depots, 119 have been equipped with the POS machines, he added.
