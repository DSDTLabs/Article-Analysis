Worry less and party hard is the life mantra of these young peeps whom we spotted at a city club, recently. All they need is a bunch of fun-loving friends and a place to make merry. And at this pub, they danced in sync with the club numbers all through the party and lived it up. Azhar, Priya, Mallika and Arun were quite impressive with their salsa moves. As they kept the energy levels kicking, they grabbed the attention of the shutterbugs. Abhi and Tena, too, had a great time posing animatedly for the photogs. Along with others, expats like Justina and Anna were also seen having fun at the party.
