BENGALURU: Congressman  , who earned the name "Petrol Swamy" after he sprinkled petrol in a BBMP office last week and threatened to set it on fire, surrendered at the   police station on Friday. Home minister   had assured the legislature on Thursday that former president of   would be arrested. 

 Police told TOI in the evening that they were still recording his statement and that he was not produced before a magistrate or court. Narayanaswamy was taken to the BBMP office for a mahajar and later brought back to the station. 
 
 Based on a February 16 video that surfaced on Tuesday, police have booked a case under four sections of IPC and section 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, which deals with causing damage to public property. 
 
 The sections under IPC are 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty); 341 (wrongful restraint); 506 (criminal intimidation) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50). 
 
 As Narayanaswamy remained absconding till Thursday, the opposition had accused the government of protecting errant leaders. A video of the incident that took place on February 16 surfaced close on the heels of MLA N A Haris' son physically assaulting a man at a restaurant in UB City, adding to the ruling party's embarrassment.
