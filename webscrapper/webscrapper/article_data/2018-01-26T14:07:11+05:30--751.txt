 Cher expressed her sentiments about US Press Secretary Sarah Sanders style and shamed her for her everyday wear on  .
 
  
  
 
 "Would someone please tell Sarah Huckabee Sanders to stop dressing like a sister wife,"   has said.
 
  
  
 
 The singer illustrated her tweet with an image of two women in stereotypical clothing. 
 
 In the photo the women also sport braids, plain lace-up shoes and high-neck dresses with long sleeves and puffy shoulders.
 
 One Twitter user wasn't pleased with the singer's fashion criticism and lashed back at the 71-year-old by sharing an image of Cher at the 2017   when the singer performed in a barely-there diamond ensemble with a sheer and sequined innerwear and blond wig.
