PANAJI/MARGAO:   has been declared as a sensitive zone, North Goa district collector   said, even as the authorities continue with raids, less than 48 hours before the state goes into polling.

 64 notices have been sent to candidates for violating the expenditure rules. The collector reassured voters regarding the secrecy of their ballot through VVPAT, adding that “rumour mongers will be punished”.
 
 “We want to reiterate again that the VVPAT machines comply with complete secrecy about the voters. There are rumours being spread that people will get to know whom you have voted for and that is false,” Mohanan said.
 
 Sharing information about the raids conducted during the period in which the model code of conduct was in place, SP (North Goa) Karthik Kashyap said that various government departments seized goods worth Rs 25 lakh and undocumented currency worth Rs 1.5 crore.
 
 “We have setup 11 nakaas and many temporary pickets. There are 24 companies of CAPF, combined with personnel from Goa police and home guards. Three polling stations in St Cruz and one in Calangute are sensitive and are under vigilance,” Kashyap said.
 
 Police officials also revealed that cash worth Rs 15 lakh was seized in Porvorim from Rajkumar Desai.
 
 Talking about final preparations on the eve of the elections, Mohanan informed that the process of transfering EVM machines, along with other poll material, will begin anytime tomorrow, post 12pm, and booths will be set up accordingly.
 
 “Apart from the pink polling booths, we will be providing assistance to people with physical, as well as visual impairments. Voter guides will be available at all the polling stations to help people understand the polling process,” Mohanan said.
