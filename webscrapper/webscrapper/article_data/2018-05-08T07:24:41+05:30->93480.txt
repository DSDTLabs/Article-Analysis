HYDERABAD: After a seven-year-old liver transplant patient was left stranded at a city hospital for seven days as her family did not have the money to settle the final bill and secure her release,   was finally discharged on Monday.

 While the hospital maintained that the delay in releasing the girl was to do with ‘clinical reasons’, her family claimed the hospital had asked them to clear a pending amount of Rs 8.5 lakh on April 30 itself, her earlier date of release.
 
 
 Akshara, who was suffering from liver failure, posted her plight on Twitter and eventually funding support came from various quarters, including IT minister  , who pledged Rs 2 lakh from the CM’s relief fund on learning about her condition.
 
 The girl’s father, who was employed as an office boy in   donated part of his liver and underwent the surgery at the hospital. While he was discharged four days back, he will remain bed-ridden for the next three months, doctors said.“I was very happy when I was told that my daughter will be discharged on April 30, but later the hospital asked us to clear the Rs 8.5 lakh pending amount or we cannot take her home. Of the pending amount, Rs 6 lakh has been pledged by a doctor from Rainbow hospital and another Rs 2 lakh will be given from the CM’s relief fund,” Ashok Kumar, Akshara’s father told TOI on Sunday.

The hospital late on Monday clarified that the case needed special attention hence the patient was in the hospital for 5-6 days for the post surgery clinical care.
