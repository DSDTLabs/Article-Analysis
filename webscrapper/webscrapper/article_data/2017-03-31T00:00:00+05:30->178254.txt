The album   has songs by a relatively lesser-known composer,  . 

 The musician does have those noteworthy sparks of talent, but those are not much on display in his latest bunch of songs. The album hardly evokes any emotion and the music doesn’t stay in your mind. Ethetho Swapnamo, the opening song penned by Siby Padiyara, has a male and female version by Vaisakh C Madhav and Anju Joseph. A melodious and romantic song with a tinge of melancholy, Ethetho is the best of the album. It conveys intense romance well. Vaisakh sings it with the right emotions while the female version by Anju is just about okay. 
 
 The next track Vaadathe Veezhathe is sung by Arun Haridas Kamath and Arun Alat, and penned by Harinarayanan BK. The singers give their best, but it’s a below average composition that has nothing outstanding to win one’s attention. Pettupokumo, sung by Vineeth Sreenivasan, is a song for heartbroken, drunk dudes in love who just can’t forget their sweetheart. It comes across as a strictly average track. 
 
 The short track Ashik Ashik by Arun Haridas Kamath, Sudheesh US, Liboy Praisly Kripesh, Vaishakh C Madhav and Sankar Sharma, penned by Pious Guit is also a thoroughly mediocre fare. Paadidaam by Arun Haridas Kamath and Liboy Praisly Kripesh, penned by Pious Guit, is a fun song. It is also rather mediocre but the track will get you on your feet while it lasts.
