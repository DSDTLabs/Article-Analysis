THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   issue pertaining to the   Tejaswini, which is almost a decade old, became a hot point of contention at the council meeting on Tuesday after the tax appeal standing committee headed by BJP councillor Simi Jyothish granted tax reduction without the knowledge of the secretary or the mayor.

 In 2008, the city corporation had served a demand notice of Rs 6.98 crore on the building by calculating 18% annual rental value. The Technopark authorities demanded the revision of this amount by reassessing percentage as 6% of annual rental value. In 2016, the urban affairs department directed tax appeal committee to look into the matter following which Rs 6.98 crore was revised to 1.82 crore.
 
 The ruling council said that only when the authorities turned up to pay the reduced amount they knew that the issue had been settled. Senior LDF councillors Palayam Rajan, R P Sivaji and Kanjirampara Ravi said the committee had violated norms to implement tax revision for the building.
 
 BJP councilor and chairperson of the committee Simi Jyothish tried to counter the allegation saying that she acted well within the norms. Deputy mayor Rakhi Ravikumar then pointed out that a procedural error had been committed by the committee by re-assessing tax of the building without the consent of the council. She said that the circumstances which led to this violation ought to be probed.
 
 Mayor V K Prasanth has directed corporation secretary to probe the issue and submit a report. Once the report was received corporation would decide whether the decision of tax appeal standing committee should be upheld or cancelled.
