MUMBAI: Eighty-three days after she landed in Mumbai amid flashing camera lights, Egyptian Eman Ahmed-until recently the heaviest woman in the world at 500kg- 
  in a special ambulance driven along a green corridor organized by Mumbai Police. 

 Saifee Hospital, where Eman was hospitalized since February 11, will hand over a 29-sheet transfer file to officials of Bhurjeel Hospital,  , before the departure. At a press conference held at Saifee Hospital on Wednesday, the medical team said it has "forgiven" Eman's sister Shaimaa Semil for 
  .
 
  "Eman will surely miss me just as I will miss her," said Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, the bariatric surgeon who brought the 36-year-old for treatment. "When I had stopped by to visit her, along with some dignitaries earlier in the day, she held my hand. I am sure she understands she is leaving the hospital," said the doctor who managed to reduce Eman's weight to 170 kg.
 
 "My only fear throughout has been whether she will go back. There is reference in medical literature of two patients her size who have been operated on. While one passed away immediately after surgery, the other is lost to follow. We have carefully recorded Eman's treatment as it is a medical marvel," said Dr Lakdawala.
