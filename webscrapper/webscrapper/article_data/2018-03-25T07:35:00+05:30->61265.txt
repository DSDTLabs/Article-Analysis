Dharamshala: Speaking at the concluding session of Tibetan Budget on Saturday, president of Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) Lobsang Sangay said a budget of Rs 265 crores was approved to uplift various sections of Tibetan community in exile. 

 At the session, Sangay also urged Indians to be intellectually-engaged in gauging the trends in global political diplomacy and assert the Tibetan voice in the global narrative. He said that the coming three to four years was an important window for the Tibetan cause. 
 
 While replying to questions during the budget session of Tibetan Parliament-in-exile, he said China is being cautiously gauged by global powers. “There is a growing speculation over shift in power from the west to east. There is a possibility of war in Asia in the next 5 to 10 years and in this China will be a key player,” Sangay observed.
