HYDERABAD: Engineering student Uttam, who ran over a 60-year-old man at Gandhi Nagar in Rajendranagar, was arrested on Thursday evening after   proved he wasn't a minor. Police said he was 18 years and was a first-year B.Tech student. 

 The youth was speeding his brand new Maruti S-Cross with blaring music through a narrow stretch. Rajendranagar police confirmed Uttam, who ran over Gandhi Nagar resident Mallesh Yadav, was an adult.
 
 After exiting Outer Ring Road (ORR) at Himayatsagar, Uttam drove into a narrow stretch in Gandhi Nagar at high speed and first hit the concrete steps of Yadav's neighbour's house and then rammed into two bikes. These in turn crashed into Mallesh and his tenant Veerababu, who were standing outside their house. Later, the car which still sports a temporary registration number, hit a wall and overturned. Luckily, air bags in the car opened due to the impact and Uttam and his cousins survived.
 
 "The victims were found buried under the rubble of the wall that collapsed in the impact. It was a case of overspeeding," said Satyanarayana Mudiraj, a local. 
 
 Contrary to claims that he swerved to save a dog, Satyanarayana said, "There was no dog or any other obstruction on the road. It was a clear case of careless driving with loud music.'' 
 
 The car was registered in the name of the erring student's uncle Ashwin. "The student did not possess a driving licence. During investigation, it was found Uttam was not driving under the influence of liquor as the breathalyser test was negative,'' said Rajendranagar SI K Narayana Reddy. Mallesh's autopsy was conducted at Osmania Hospital and forensic authorities concluded the victim died to multiple injuries on his chest, liver, ribs and head.
