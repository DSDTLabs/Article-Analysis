ROHTAK: After seeking the support of controversial jailed godman Rampal, All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (Aijass) chief   on Sunday appealed to Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda’s head,  , to extend support to the community in getting reservation in government jobs and at educational institutions.

 Malik, addressing the media after participating in ‘Balidan Diwas’ at Jassia on Sunday, said the community was thankful to Rampal and would stand in his support when needed. “Not only Rampal, I want to appeal to the   chief to extend his support. The Sirsa-based dera’s support is crucial to us. After all, it is because of the dera that the BJP was voted to power in  . If they support us, it would pressure the government to accept our demands,” he said.
 
 Rampal’s supporters have donated Rs 11 lakh to Aijass for holding sit-in across the state this year. On the decade-long controversy between Rampal’s supporters and Arya Samaj activists, Malik said he would try to diffuse tension by holding a meeting between the two sides.
