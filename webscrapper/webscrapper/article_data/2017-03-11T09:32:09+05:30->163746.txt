South actress   got engaged to her long-time beau,   producer Naveen, who made her Kannada film Romeo, on Thursday. The ring exchange was held in a simple ceremony at her residence in Thrissur, Kerala. “The ceremony was supposed to be held on March 3, but we had to push it ahead by a few days due to deaths in both families. Also, it’s not long since   lost his mother and Bhavana her father,” says Pushpa, Bhavana’s mother. The plan, she adds, was to have a simple ring exchange in front of pictures of the deceased, but Naveen’s family wanted rituals associated with a Telugu-style engagement, which is why garlands were exchanged, prompting many to wonder if Bhavana had actually gotten married.

 Pushpa says that the family meant to keep it a quiet affair and announce the wedding later on, but pictures from the event emerged online. “Only close family members were present. There were about nine people from Naveen’s family. Manju Warrier and   were also there.”
 
 The wedding will be held at the end of the year, but nothing else, including the venue, has been decided. “Both parties want a simple wedding. It might not be easy for Naveen’s entire family to come over here, so they might be attending the reception. Moreover, Bhavana has films to complete before the wedding,” she says, adding, “They always wanted to get married, but Bhavana has been evading finalizing details. I finally managed to get her to fix the engagement,” laughs Pushpa. Bhavana is expected to join the set of her Kannada film Tagaru this week, after which she will head to Scotland for her Malayalam film, Adam Joan.
