Vadodara: Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) removed the triangular traffic island with plantation and the bust of late Maganbhai Shankarbhai Patel in Sayajigunj area of the city. The space is being incorporated in the civic body’s station area development plan. The triangle was located behind Sayajigunj clock tower that housed the traffic department office of the city police. The office is being provided an alternative space by the VMC near Narhari Hospital in Fatehgunj area of the city. Sources said Patel’s bust will be installed elsewhere. Patel was close to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and was the former president of Baroda Municipality. He was among the key persons who founded Baroda Dairy. On Saturday, the civic body also cleaned the space on ST Depot Road where a razing drive had been conducted on Friday evening. Officials said the space needed for the urban transport hub is largely clear now.
