MOHALI:   Kulwant   on Thursday challenged the show cause notice issued to him by the department of local bodies of   in the high court. In his petition, he has pleaded that the notice issued to him is illegal and unwanted and has requested that the notice be stayed. The petition is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.

 Initially, Mohali mayor   said the notice had dented his image. Kulwant Sigh while talking to TOI said, “We have filed a petition in the high court. The   issued to me is illegal and does not carry any merit.” 
 
 Stating that the allegations must be proven first, he said, “I have no space for corruption in my life as I have no lust for money. By God’s grace, I am wealthy enough to earn meager amount of money out of municipal corporation (MC) funds. Terming a person like me to be corrupt is actually a political vendetta to malign my image.”
 
 The showcause notice was issued by the department on the directions of Navjot Sidhu, minister for local bodies, Punjab on the allegations of corruption in the purchase of a tree pruning machine for Mohali MC.
 
 Sidhu in a press statement said it had come to the notice of the department that Singh in connivance with the then commissioner   and other officials indulged in blatant misuse of his position and caused a loss of grave nature to the state exchequer while making a purchase of the tree pruning machine.
 
 Earlier, Punjab government had issued a press statement alleging that mayor Kulwant Singh has been suspended as a councillor but within two hours of issuance of this statement, Punjab government retracted and corrected the statement saying that a showcause notice has been issued instead.
