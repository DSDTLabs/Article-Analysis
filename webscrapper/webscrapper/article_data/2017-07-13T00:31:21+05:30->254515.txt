Coimbatore: In an effort to improve fertility of sterile cows, the animal husbandry department is conducting an   camp at Mullanoor block in Tirupur on Thursday.

 It is the 16th camp that the department is conducting in Tirupur district, said the joint director of animal husbandry department in Tirupur, Murugan. 
 
 “We had conducted 15 such camps in small villages like Pappavalakku, Kasilingapuram and Kalinathanpalayam among others. As many as 30 to 40 cows, which were unable to conceive, were brought to those camps. Across the State, the natural conception rate among cows has currently been pegged at around 60%,” he said.
 
 Veterinarians at the camp test blood and urine samples and even conduct ultra-sound   of reproductive organs for further investigation. About 70% to 80% of the cows are treatable, they said. “Some of the cows could not conceive as they have been taken for mating or artificial insemination at the wrong time of ovulation as many farmers do not know how to pinpoint the exact 72 hours for successful mating. Cows with polycystic ovaries can easily be treated,” said joint director of animal husbandry department in Coimbatore T Thamilselvan. As many as 12 such camps were conducted in Coimbatore, he said.
 
 “About 5% to 10% cows do not conceive despite all efforts because their ovaries have not developed properly since birth, uterus problems or infantile genitalia,” Murugan said.
 
 A group of people operating a private cattle market at Palayakottai in Tirupur, specially for trade of Kangeyam cattle, have set up an ultrasound scan facility in its premises. The portable battery-powered scan machine is operated by a veterinarian, who authorises sales at the market. “We bought the scan machine so that farmers who invest quite a bit of their savings on buying a   and depend on it for producing calves and milk regularly for their income, can be assured that the animal they buy from here is perfectly healthy,” the market in-charge said.
