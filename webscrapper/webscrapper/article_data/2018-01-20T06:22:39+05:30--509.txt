HYDERABAD: After allowing engineering, pharmacy and colleges offering other technical courses to change affiliating university from   Technological University Hyderabad (JNTU) to any other varsity in the state last year,   made it clear that this year it won't entertain any requests as they have 'sole jurisdiction in   for grant of affiliation to technical courses.'

 The varsity made it clear that they won't be issuing No Objection Certificate ( ) to any college offering engineering, technology, and pharmacy programs to move to other varsities.
 
 "The university is of the view that the request for change of affiliating university by any college offering engineering, technology, and pharmacy programs cannot be considered for issue of NOC as   has sole jurisdiction in the entire state for grant of affiliation to technical courses under JNTU Act," read a letter sent from the varsity to a chairman of a pharmacy college, who applied for NOC to change the affiliating university of his college from JNTU to Telangana University.
 
 The letter, signed by the JNTU registrar N Yadaiah further read "As per the advice of the standing committee on Affiliations ( ) the university wrote a letter to the state government for its directions and awaiting the same. As and when the state government gives its clarification, your application will be processed again and necessary orders of NOC or rejection orders will be passed in due course." 
 
 The college managements, however, found the varsity's justification 'weird' as there are many technical colleges affiliated to Osmania, Kakatiya or other varsities in the state. They said that by having absurd rules, the varsity is aims to reduce technical colleges in the state.
 
 "JNTU is asking for 100 percent compliance with its rules, which is impossible. So many colleges are contemplating to move out of JNTU and if the varsity fails to issue NOC's or give some relaxations, the colleges are ready to move to court," said K Ramadas, convener, Telangana Private College Management Association.
