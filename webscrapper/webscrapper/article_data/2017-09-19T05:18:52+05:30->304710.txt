KOLKATA: On a day the Centre told the   that a section of Rohingyas has links to terror outfits, including the Islamic State, top Bangladeshi officials in Kolkata said the continued refugee influx into their country is turning into a security issue. Bangladesh, like India, faces threat from fundamentalist and terror outfits.

 Bangladesh’s minister of state for foreign affairs Mohammed Shahriar Alam said his country was accepting Rohingyas on humanitarian grounds but the terror threat associated with the community couldn’t be ruled out. Bangladesh already has a population of 4 lakh Rohingyas. Alam said 4 lakh more had crossed the border with Myanmar in the last fortnight, taking the total to eight lakh. 
 
 “That is why we have asked Myanmar to take care of them,” he said.
 
 Alam hinted that a major influx like the one going on could give rise to tensions with the local population. Law enforcing agencies have been alerted, he said while speaking at a seminar organised by Jadavpur University. Alam, however, said that Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina didn’t treat the   population as a burden. “We have a population of 16 crore and feeding eight lakh additional people is not a major challenge,” he added.
