Kolkata: They were among the first few Indian families to start living in the British settlement around old   (Now GPO). The white town — as the European settlement was called then — stretched from   (Dalhousie) to Armenian Street. The family battled many odds to hold on to their property for the last three centuries. But on July 15, the Rohtagis will have to leave their ancestral home, albeit temporarily, to facilitate the tunnel boring for East-West  .

  is a worried man sitting behind his big secretarial table. “It is a very old house. I am anxious about the health of the house after the passage of the TBM,” said Prabhat Kumar Rohtagi, one of the many residents at 44 and 45 Armenian Street. 
 
 The Rohtagi family, now scattered all over the world, gets united at this ancestral house only during family weddings. “Our wealthy forefathers, who came from Patna, became the banker for British  . One of my forefathers bought this house — then a single-storied building — from an Armenian gentleman. My forefathers then added floors to it,” said Rohtagi added.
 
 According to him, the building has become “a white elephant” to maintain. “The rent I get is meagre. But the new tax regime would charge me on the basis of area I occupy. It would be very difficult for people like us to retain their ancestral property the way we have done so far,” he rued.
