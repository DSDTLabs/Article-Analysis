GURUGRAM: Day 2 of the   diversions on the expressway at the   border didn’t see much of a difference. The situation on Tuesday evening was quite similar to the one witnessed on Monday. Traffic started building up around 5pm, and bottlenecks continued till about 9pm. MCD officials and police were seen manually redirecting commercial traffic to lanes assigned to them, as specific signages were not up yet. The number of traffic personnel on ground trying to manage the situation, though, had fallen significantly from Day 1. 

 Many   said there were unhappy with the experiment, but there were some like Arun Kumar who saw this as a teething problem. “I’m sure once commuters become aware of the changes, things will fall in place and the situation will improve. This experiment should have been carried out long ago,” said Kumar, an engineer who works in Udyog Vihar.
 
 Earlier in the day, police commissioner   visited the trouble-spot with DCP (traffic) Deepak Gahlawat, Delhi traffic officials and other officials, and held detailed discussions on how to resolve the recurring bottlenecks. They accepted some diversions will be necessary to ensure smooth traffic movement in the coming days. Khirwar instructed officers on duty to take immediate action on the observations.
 
 “We’re concerned by the trouble commuters faced on Monday and want to assure them we’re putting all efforts to free the area of congestion. We also seek support of commuters, who should obey all traffic rules. Those who want to turn back towards Guugram or Dwarka should keep to the left, while those who want to go to Delhi should keep to the right at the Rajkori flyover exit,” said a traffic official. The trials on the expressway will go on for a few more days, he said.
