Mornings are that special time in your life when you get to start over. I see it as an opportunity to reclaim the magic, start a new chapter. They can be transforming. Brace yourself – my day begins at 4.30am. A gym routine and a taskmaster in a trainer got me into the habit. I follow a morning ritual; it starts with choosing the flavour of my day. No matter how hard or great things were the night before, I choose optimism through GIVE - Gratitude, Insighting, Visualisation and Exercise.

 I waken my mind by giving thanks and forgiving those who may have hurt me in anyway. I sit by the window for a few minutes soaking in the solitude. I ask myself, “What can I do to make this world more beautiful, today?” and listen to my inner voice. This insighting guides my strategy for the day. I visualise a victorious day and believe things will happen as much as I believe there will be a tomorrow. Light exercises move my stiff body into aliveness. Once, the mind and body are tuned, it’s time to refuel. A warm glass of water with lime and honey to alkanise and hydrate my body followed by a hearty breakfast. I never skip this.
