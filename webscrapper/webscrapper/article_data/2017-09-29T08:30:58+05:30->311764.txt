LUCKNOW: Lucknow Municipal Corporation’s announcement to impose   from Rs 1,000 to Rs 50,000 for littering came into effect on Thursday but sanitary staff failed to catch offenders on Day 1, citing shortage of sanitary staff and absence of an action plan. The only fine—of Rs 5,000 — imposed on Thursday was on the UP  , for allegedly burning   in the open. “We have limited number of sanitary inspectors to ensure no one litters in their wards and to penalise offenders on the spot. More over, since there is no action plan in place, we have no idea of how to go about executing the new order,” said a senior   official. 

 LMC may have revised its penalty rates but has not trained sanitary staff on how to crack down on those violating cleanliness norms. Since the time rules to check littering were framed earlier this year, only a few offenders have been fined. Though a lot of complaints are reported everyday, no action has been taken. LMC officials said, “Since there is shortage of sanitary staff, we cannot expect them to be present everywhere to check the menace and have to depend on people’s complaints to know where and when norms are being flouted.” 
 
 The corporation has revised its penalty rates for dumping or burning garbage in the open, polluting the river and other water bodies, open defecation, etc but has not provided an effective system to discourage people from following the rules. It has neither built enough public and community toilets, nor has it begun collecting garbage from all houses in the city. LMC has also not developed a vigilance system in the city to see no one dumps garbage in the open.
