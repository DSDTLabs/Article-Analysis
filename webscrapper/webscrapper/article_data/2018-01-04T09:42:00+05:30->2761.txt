CAPE TOWN: Indian opener Murali   believes that playing against quality swing bowling is more challenging than tackling bounce. Speaking to reporters in Cape Town two days ahead of the opening Test against South Africa, Vijay admitted that he is able to manage bounce quite comfortably, but swing is the challenging bit.

 "Swing poses more challenges than bounce. That is because bounce can be managed but swing is difficult," Vijay said here on Wednesday. "I have been here a couple of times. It's challenging for openers. It is difficult to play both seam and bounce, and you can learn a lot of things. If you have some X factor in your game, you can do well," the Indian opener said as journalists bombarded him with questions on opening in challenging conditions.
 
 "I have prepared well with an open mind. If they bowl in good areas, then you have to try and counter that," Vijay said.
 
 The   opener also reminded that having preconceived notions isn't good when playing Test cricket. "You cannot have a set pattern - you cannot go into a Test thinking you are going to leave so many balls. You also have to be in the right frame of mind to score runs," Vijay said. When asked about the green top pitch which may greet the Indians, Vijay said: "It is quite green. I don't know how it will behave on Day One."
