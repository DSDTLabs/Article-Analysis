HYDERABAD: In what appeared to be a case of political high-handedness, a video of two men - believed to be aides of   corporator, P Anitha Reddy - assaulting a third person outside the local   ( ) office, surfaced on social media platforms on Friday. The victim was later identified as Sudarshan, a resident of Saroornagar. 

 The visuals, sent to TOI by a resident of the area, D Jagannanth, shows the two people - one wearing a pink shirt and the other a white shirt - attacking the victim and hurling abuses at him. Even worse, two minutes into the video, a third person, armed with a stick comes to attack the victim. 
 
 "The video was shot two days ago. The attackers were claiming to be followers of the corporator. They had reportedly attacked the resident for his failure to pay a   to the corporator for some work related to his building," he said. 
 
 Some persons familiar with the incident identified the assaulters as Devender Reddy and Janga Reddy, private financiers operating in the area. According to these sources, who refused to be identified, the two had extended financial assistance to the victim and were attacking him in a bid to usurp his property. "They might have used the corporator's name to ensure the victim parted with his house for loan default," said one of them. 
 
 While the lower-rung officials of the GHMC were aware of the incident, the deputy commissioner of the area, P Saroja, claimed she did not have know about the incident. "We will investigate the matter," she said. When contacted, Anitha Reddy, however, tried to hush up the matter and even claimed to have no links with the attackers. "I do not know these men. There are people who are trying to defame me, this must be their doing," she said.
 
 This is not the first time the corporator or her aides have been accused of such acts. 
 
 On June 3, a TV journalist was attacked by the owner of a biryani shop and two other persons, who claimed to be associates of the corporator.
