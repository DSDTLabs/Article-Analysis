MUMBAI: The news of a split between   and BJP ahead of the   is music for the ears of parties like MIM and SP that depend not just on Muslim votes, but also wish for a division in Hindutva ranks. Leaders in the two parties said the split in the Sangh Parivar will benefit them.

 MIM which has two MLAs—Byculla and Aurangabad—is fighting the BMC elections for the first time. Its Byculla candidate in the 2014 assembly poll won with a margin of 1,357 votes by defeating Congress’s Madhukar Chavan. Pathan had benefited in a multi-cornered fight where Maharashtrian votes got divided among Congress, BJP (Madhukar G Chavan) and Akhil Bharatiya Sena’s (Geeta Gawli). MIM would like the similar trend to be repeated in the BMC polls. “MIM will benefit in the sense that anti-MIM votes will get divided as we are not eying just Muslim votes. We have given tickets to Dalits too and their support will benefit us,” said Pathan.
 
 SP, which has so far announced to contest 23 seats, sees an “opportunity” in the Shiv Sena-BJP split. “We will benefit at least on three seats in Govandi due to the split in the Sena, BJP. Our chances will increase if Congress and SP stich an alliance,” said Raees Shaikh, SP candidate in Madanpura (ward 211). Shaikh added that the chances of Congress-SP pre-poll alliance in Mumbai had brightened after the two parties joined hands in the UP.
