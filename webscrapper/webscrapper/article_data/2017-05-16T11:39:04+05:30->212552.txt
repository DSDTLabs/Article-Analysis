HYDERABAD: A vacation bench of the Hyderabad High Court, on Monday, directed the state of Telangana, its DGP, Rachakonda police commissioner and Bhongir police to file a detailed affidavit on the efforts they made so far to trace a 24-year-old man who has been missing since May 2, 2017. 

 This was in response to an urgent petition moved as a house motion by a Bhongir resident, seeking production of his 24-year-old son before the court. The missing man works as a dabbawala in Mumbai. The police were given three days to brief the court about the progress.
 
 The bench comprising Justice P   and Justice M S   sat at the former's residence and heard the habeas carpus plea filed by Amboji Venkataiah, who was worried about the safety of his son, Naresh. According to his counsel, NS  , Naresh and his classmate,  , were in love and got married discreetly. 
 
 Then they moved to Mumbai and have been living there from March 25, 2017. As they belonged to different communities, they feared backlash from the elders and so did not inform them about their decision top get married. While the boy belongs to the Rajaka community, the girl is from the Reddy caste.
 
 However, Swathi's father,  , traced the whereabouts of the couple and invited them to their native village near Bhongir with the promise of accepting their marriage. 
 
 They returned to Bhongir on May 2. 
 
 The girl's father immediately took her away from Naresh. Then Naresh, too, went missing from that day onwards, the counsel said.
 
 "Given the criminal track record of the girl's father, we are apprehending danger to the life of the missing boy," he said. 
 
 Swati has always been apprehensive of her father and had filed a complaint before the Mumbai police on the day of their marriage, informing them about their decision to marry and also about any possible efforts by her father to take her away forcibly, Arjun Kumar said. 
 
 The bench directed the police to produce Swati before the court on May 18.
