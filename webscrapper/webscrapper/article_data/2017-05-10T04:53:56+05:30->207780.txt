VADODARA: The anti-corruption bureau (ACB), on Tuesday, opposed bail application of cash-for-marks scam accused and founder of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth,  , saying that investigations and inquiries against him were going on at various fronts.

 The agency told the court that apart from independent investigations by   (ED) for money laundering, the   department, Vadodara district administration and district development office are conducting investigations against Shah on different issues.
 
 The special public prosecutor in the case Bharat Badami told the court that the accused and his son have been using facilities of calling line identification restriction since seven to eight years and have been violating norms and guidelines of   (DoT), which need to be probed.
 
 He said that the ACB has also written to chief vigilance officers of   (UGC) and Medical Council of India (MCI). 
 
 On the other hand, Shah’s lawyer BR Trivedi pointed to the fact that the FIR mainly talks about filling of examination form. 
 
 He then brought the copies of circulars of the college about it and the complainant’s form to the court’s notice.
 
 The sessions court will hear further arguments on Thursday.
