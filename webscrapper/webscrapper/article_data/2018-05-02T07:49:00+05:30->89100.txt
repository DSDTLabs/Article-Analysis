Ludhiana: Irked by the slow pace of development works in the wards of the central constituency,   Surinder Dawar — along with senior deputy   Sham Sunder Malhotra, and other councillors — met mayor Balkar Sandhu on Tuesday. The MLA is upset with MC officials for ignoring development works in the wards of his constituency, especially when works in East and West constituencies were proceeding at a brisk pace. However, the mayor rued shortage of funds for the same.

 MLA Dawar first raised the issue of replacement of ordinary street lights with LED ones, because work had started in East and West constituencies belonging to MLA Sanjay Talwar and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. The MLA had asked the mayor to get those projects started in his constituency as well. He also raised the issue of a flaw in the design of a drain falling between Shivaji Nagar and New Shivaji Nagar, while officials have also been asked to meet experts in IIT Roorkee for a solution to the problem as soon as possible.
 
 The MLA and other councillors raised some more issues of the area, in which works related to streets and other development works were included. However, the mayor blamed the paucity of funds with MC for the slow pace of development works. He requested the MLA to ensure the recovery of pending dues from defaulters of property tax, water and sewerage dues, so that MC could concentrate on the development of wards in his constituency.
