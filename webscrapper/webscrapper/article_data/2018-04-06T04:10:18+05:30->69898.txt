MUMBAI:   paper leak mastermind, Maths teacher   (47), had collected money from 26 students, most of them repeaters enrolled at his Brilliant Classes in Ambernath and got them fresh admissions at a school in Aurangabad with a guarantee they would pass the exams.

 Though no details are known yet about the financial aspect of the deal, the package included transportation from Mumbai, boarding and lodging, and pick-up and drop to the examination centre in Aurangabad. Khan was arrested on March 20.
 
 These details came to light when Amboli police made the sixth arrest on Thursday. Atish Kadam (32) was employed as an English teacher at Khanâ€™s coaching class and was also vice-principal of a junior college.
 
 The racket was busted when  , an invigilator at   in Andheri (West), got suspicious on seeing a 15-year-old student flanked by two others glued to their mobiles and referring to books minutes before the exam. She informed board officials and lodged an FIR after allowing the student to write his History and Political Science paper on March 19.
 
 Based on the complaint, DCP (Zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya supervised a team led by investigating officer   who arrested a total of five persons. According to an Amboli police officer, Khan and Kadam planned the question paper leak after the Mumbra school was designated as an SSC centre.
 
 Kadam travelled with the students to Aurangabad two days prior to the exam. His job was to get the students to revise the paper he received from Khan at 9.15am and drop them at the exam centre where he additionally ensured they got help to cheat.
