CHENNAI:   came to a standstill on   on Tuesday after members of the Viduthalai Siruthaigal Katchi ( ) blocked roads staging a protest. The protesters, who demanded that the   be included under the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, observed that the apex court order diluting the act was unacceptable.

 The VCK has staged demonstrations across the state for more than a week. The protesters raised slogans against the Centre and demanded efforts to include the SC/ST Act under the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, which is beyond judicial review. They squatted on the roads and were later picked up by the police.
 
 Commuters, meanwhile, had a tough time navigating the surrounding roads especially in the evening. The stretch between Little Mount church to   saw traffic snarls as early as 1.30pm, leading to slow-moving traffic. Commuting on the Maraimalai Adigal Bridge on Anna Salai turned out to be a task for passersby as several protesters including VCK and   cadres had parked their vehicles in a haphazard manner on the roads. As the police were busy monitoring the protestors, it seemed like there were a lesser number of police personnel to help regulate the traffic, said a commuter.
 
 “It took me at least an hour to cross Kathipara Junction,” said Sundar, a commuter from Pazhavanthangal. “Traffic policemen found it difficult to regulate motorists. People who tried to take an alternate route via Alandur to avoid the traffic were also stuck in the jam.” 
 
 Several MTC buses were delayed, with bus passengers saying they were set back by nearly 45 minutes.
