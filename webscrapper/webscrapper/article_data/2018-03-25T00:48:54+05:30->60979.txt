MUMBAI: During the current academic session’s   and   that wrapped up on Saturday, the state   refused to allow as many as 42 city students to write their papers for arriving late. Another 57 were permitted to take their   in spite of arriving   but after being subjected to checks for cheating material.

 This is the first time the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has   late   to exam halls. The board was prompted to introduce the rule following a series of paper leaks in the previous years. Until last year, students were given 30-minute grace period to enter exam halls.
 
 Board officials, though, intended to make exceptions in unavoidable circumstances. On the first day of the exams, officials had informed exam conductors to allow up to 20 minutes delay but only after registering their details with the board and checking their belongings, including phones, for any exam -related material. There were 25 such HSC and 32   cases.
 
 The board strictly did not allow students who came in later than 20 minutes—28 in HSC and 14 SSC. “None of these students had a compelling reason to be late. We were given reasons ranging from traffic to wrong reading of the timetable,” said Subhash Borse, in-charge secretary, state board’s Mumbai division, including Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad.
 
 While this exam, too, was marred by a series of paper leaks, officials hope the step will help students understand the importance of being on time. “The measure was introduced to curb the reach of papers being sent out through social media. We hope this will send out a message of discipline and the need to reach exam halls on time, bringing down late entries next year,” said Borse.
