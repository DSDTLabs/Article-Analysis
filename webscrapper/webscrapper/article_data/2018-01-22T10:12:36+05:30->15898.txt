NEW DELHI. Soon after President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday approved Election Commission’s recommendation to disqualify 20 AAP MLAs, BJP MP   came forward to support the party on Twitter.

 Playing around the word ‘AAP’, Sinha backed the party for being “the talk of the town”. He used a small verse in Hindi that loosely translates to “AAP came, AAP conquered and only AAP is in everybody’s thoughts. AAP is in every household, AAP is in every news, AAP need not worry about anything”.
 
 In the same tweet, he took an apparent jibe at his own party by saying that “politics of vendetta doesn’t last long”.
 
  
  
 Sinha, who is a known dissenting voice within BJP, quickly followed it up with another tweet, where he prayed that ‘AAP’ gets divine justice.
 
  
  
 AAP chief   acknowledged Sinha’s support by retweeting his tweets.
 
 Sinha’s fondness for AAP is not a new-found phenomenon. The actor turned politician has been effusive in praising the party ever since it first came to power in Delhi in 2014.
 
 Back then, he had called AAP “the Baap (father) of all parties” and asked other political parties to take lessons of honesty and transparency from it.
 
 Meanwhile another veteran ‘Sinha’ from the BJP, Yashwant, too labelled President’s order disqualifying AAP MLAs as “Tughluqshahi of the worst kind”. The former finance minister called the entire episode “complete miscarriage of natural justice”.
