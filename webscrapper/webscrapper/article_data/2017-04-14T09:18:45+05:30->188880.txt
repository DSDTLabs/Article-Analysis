MANALI: The glittering white snow on the   has started turning muddy over the last few days. This dark grey colour will cause the snow to melt faster as it (dirty snow) absorbs more solar radiations than clean white snow, say experts.

 The mountains here are witnessing a strange phenomenon since last few years. Strong winds blowing in bring along a non-native red soil from plains, which settles on the snow after rainfall. It not only causes the snow to melt faster but also increases temperature in the surrounding area by absorbing the heat.
 
  scientist Dr  , who is studying the effects of light-absorbing impurities in snow, says clean snow reflects the heat radiation which slows down melting. In his study, he writes: “Dust on top of the snow significantly accelerates the (melting) process. Much of the dust that blows into snowy areas, whether in rocky mountains like the Himalayas or the Hindu Kush, comes from deserts. Humans cannot dictate the location of deserts, but their (human) activity does influence the amount of dust that blows out of them.” 
 
 Using ground-based measurements, energy-balance towers, aircraft-mounted instruments and satellite data, Painter and his team examined effects of snow impurities for a decade at many locations. The first satellite images of dirt on snow cover on Himalayas were discovered in 1990s. In  , particularly in   and   regions with high mountains and many glaciers, it has been noticed that dust covers the snow in April and it melts fast from thereon up to June. Flash floods are noticed from June to September, which are triggered by fast-melting of snow.
 
 Most of the old glaciers in Himalayas are covered with dust that makes the snow underneath melt, resulting in decreased thickness of snow. The level of rivers and steams starts rising after the dust covers snow.
