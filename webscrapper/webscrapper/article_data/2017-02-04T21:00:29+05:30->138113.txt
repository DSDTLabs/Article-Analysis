INDORE: GPO square has become one of the most   in the city. Situated in one of Indore’s oldest parts, Chhawani, motorists face several problems commuting past this area. 

  are among one of the major problems here. Even though roads on both sides are narrow, drivers of passenger vehicles add to woes of commuters as they often stop on the road to pick up and drop passengers, forcing other vehicles to wait for them.
 
 Goods transport vehicles are another problem here because of the main market here.
 
 Another problem is vehicles queuing up on the road because of a petrol pump here. Residents of the area claim authorities are aware of the situation but no measures have been taken up to ensure traffic is smooth.
 
 Motorists, especially two wheelers, can be seen driving on the road to Navlakha from the wrong direction, posing a threat to oncoming traffic. 
 
 Residents,   and traders are fed up with the situation. It is common to see drivers get out and regulate traffic in the area. Cops are rarely seen at this intersection and the ones here fail to regulate traffic properly.
 
 Roads to Chhawani and Shivaji Vatika remain so choked with vehicles that it takes hours to get through the jams.
 
 Traffic experts suggested that cops be regularly deployed here.
 
 “The area is one of the busiest areas in the city. At least two cops should be deployed at this square as traffic remains at its peak throughout the day,” said Prafulal Joshi, a traffic expert. Strict action should be taken against those who drive in the wrong lanes and also against passenger vehicles that stop near the junction.
