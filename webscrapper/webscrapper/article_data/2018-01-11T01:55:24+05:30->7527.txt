MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday asked the state government to come up with a solution to undo the sorry state of roads riddled with potholes given the failure of civic bodies to prevent or repair them. 

 The   had allocated Rs 1,095 crore to improve roads in 2017. Hearing a PIL filed suo motu after Justice   wrote to a former chief justice in July 2013 about the “pathetic” condition of Mumbai’s roads, a bench of Justices Abhay   and P N   said there must be “some grievance redressal mechanism in place too”. 
 
 Justice Oka observed, “...If the local authorities and bodies are not doing anything, then the state has the power to take action.”
