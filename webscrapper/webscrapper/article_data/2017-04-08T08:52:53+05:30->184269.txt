BAMBOLIM: Saying that the negative gender gap in the country could be reversed,   minister  , on Friday, said that Prime Minister  's flagship ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ programme has met with success across India, except for Jammu and Kashmir, and  .

 Speaking at the annual advertising festival Goafest 2017, Gandhi went on to add that the flagship programme had failed to take off in the insurgency-prone Jammu and Kashmir due to a mindset among locals that was closed to the birth of girls during strife and conflict.
 
 The programme also failed to make an impact in Bihar due to frequent changes in the administration. “Their district magistrates got transferred every three months, so nobody was willing to take ownership of the campaign. As a result, the campaign did not happen,” Gandhi said.
 
 Despite the setbacks in the two states, the Union minister for women and child development reiterated that the programme would go a long way in reducing the gender gap between girls and boys in the country and, in the long run, would help reduce violence against women.
 
 Listing the other initiatives rolled out by the Union government, Gandhi said that around 19,000 women, who were being trafficked, were rescued through special surveillance along India’s rail network.
