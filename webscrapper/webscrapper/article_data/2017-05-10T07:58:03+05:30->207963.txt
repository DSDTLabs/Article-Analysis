KOCHI: A   has alleged that she has been denied permission to release her book on   by management of a well-known and ‘progressive’   in the city at their campus.

 Writer   alleges that management of   denied her permission to release her book, ‘Meenukal Chumbikunnu’ which tells the love of two female characters  , at their college campus on next Sunday.
 
 ‘My friend had approached the college seeking permission to release the book at their campus two weeks ago. The officials also gave permission. But when my friend approached the college again on Tuesday morning to pay the fee, officials refused it and said they could not give permission”, she said. 
 
 Sree Parvathy continued “earlier the college officials did not know the book was on lesbian love. Later they came to know about it somehow. Since the theme of the book centered on female characters, we thought St Teresa’s College would be the right place to release the book”. 
 
 Following the denial of permission, Sree Paravathy and her friends decided to release the book at Children’s Park Theatre near the college itself. Writer Tanuja S Bhattathiri will release the book at 3 pm at a function attended by other dignitaries including a transgender.
 
 Though the 129 page book is on lesbian love, prelude to the story was written by director Joy Mathew. “He still has the revolutionary mind to tell things openly. He always dare to tell things what others fear to tell. That’s why I approached him requesting to write prelude to my new book”, she said.
 
 When TOI approached principal of the college Dr Sajimol Augustine M said that she was not involved in the issue and asked to approach director of the college. Sr Vinitha CSST, director of the college was not available for comment despite several efforts by TOI.
