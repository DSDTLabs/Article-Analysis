F.I.R actress   recently attended a Navratri event in Jodhpur and wore a gorgeous outfit for the occasion. While she posted a Boomerang video of the same on her Twitter account, there was a hater who got her attention for saying something nasty. 

 As Kavita wrote alongside her video, "Nothing like the Indian Anarkali outfit". The troll mocked her by remarking that the dress must have been free of cost. 
 
  
  
 Not in a mood to spare such a mean comment, the actress shot back and wrote: : "No! Unlike others I don't wear rented clothes! Everything I wear is my own hence you will see me repeat my clothes often! #noshame."
 
  
  
  
  
 Kavita was last seen on the small screen in 'Dr Bhanumati On Duty'. She has been a part of popular television series including Ghar Ek Sapna, Remix, Kutumb and others. 
 
  
  
 Of late, the actress has been making the most of her time with husband  . The two are often seen travelling together and enjoying each other's company, doing things they love.
