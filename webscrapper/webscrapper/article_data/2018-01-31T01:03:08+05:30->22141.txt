NEW DELHI: A   whose members used to pose as bank customer care executives and dupe people through phishing was busted from a village in West   by a Delhi Police team. The kingpin would get the secure banking details from the victims claiming that they were required for KYC formalities and fraudulently transfer money through NEFT.

 Police got a call from one of the victims, Rakesh Giri, who said that he had been defrauded of Rs 78,000. He had received a call from one Abhishek   who had asked him for his banking details as well as the OTP and then transferred the money online.
 
 A case was registered at   police station and the caller’s number was tracked, DCP (Shahdara) Nupur Prasad said. The account to which the money was transferred was being operated from Jamuria in Jharkhand.
 
 “The caller’s number was tracked to a village near Chittaranjan in  . A team soon reached there and Singh was arrested from his house,” said Prasad.
 
 Singh told the cops that the gang leader, Arjun Ravidas, is a resident of Dhanbad. He used to hire bank accounts opened by others and buy SIM cards on fake IDs to make the phishing calls. The gang members used to dial random numbers all over India and persuade people to give their debit or credit card information, including OTPs. The cheated money was routed to various wallets and bank accounts to distract investigating agencies.
 
 The money was finally transferred to the hired bank accounts and withdrawn via ATM cards. The statements of different bank accounts seized by police show that the gang had cheated people of approximately Rs 70 lakh.
 
 Probe also revealed that there were 5-6 members of the gang who would specifically target people from Delhi, UP and Haryana as it would be difficult for local cops to track them down in Jharkhand or West Bengal.
