Panaji: In the ongoing tussle between Corporation of City of Panaji ( ) and the government, the former has decided to rely on the legal advice suggesting a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to set up the garbage treatment plant at Bainguinim, rather than transfer any of its land.

 Reading out the legal advice by advocate Pronoy Kamat, Mayor Surendra Furtado on Tuesday said that the corporation is also against leasing out the 1.71 lakh sqm of land to Goa waste Management Corporation as it would be difficult to retrieve this incase it wants to put it to any other use.
 
 According to Adv Kamat’s suggestions, CCP may execute an MOU or agreement with the state government and Goa waste management corporation incorporating the terms and conditions to protect CCP’s interest, and to ensure that the facility will be set up in the land within a specified time-frame. 
 
 Also, waste from the jurisdiction of CCP, Taleigao and Old Goa panchayats shall be allowed to be treated on priority and that ownership rights to the land shall remain with CCP, read the advice. 
 
 It also stated that land which is not utilized shall remain with the CCP in order to utilize the same for the future needs of the corporation for waste management. Furtado blamed the present chief minister who was then appointed chairman of the subcommittee of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, for not pursuing the proposal to set up the plant.
