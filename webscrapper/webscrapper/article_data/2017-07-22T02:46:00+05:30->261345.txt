Nagpur: The Juvenile Justice Board adjourned the pronouncement of punishment to ‘juvenile in conflict with law’ in   murder case till Wednesday. The court was supposed to announce reformatory sentence to the convict, who was a minor when he conspired with main accused Rajesh Dhanalal Daware (19) and Arvind Abhilash Singh (23), for kidnapping Yug for extortion. He was found guilty under Sections 363, 364(A) read with 120(B).

 On Thursday, the verdict was pronounced by Juvenile Justice Board comprising judges — NM Bedarkar and Surekha Borkute. Being a juvenile, he can’t be sentenced to the jail like other accused and would be handed over the lighter punishment aimed at reforming him.
 
 Yug was murdered on September 1, 2014, that sparked off a huge outrage and protests in the city. It was second such killing in the city within three years after another eight-year-old Kush Katariya was killed by Ayush Naresh Pugalia on October 11, 2011, for extracting Rs2 crore ransom from his parents.
 
 With a view to take revenge from noted dentist and also extract ransom, Daware and Singh hatched the conspiracy with juvenile to kidnap and kill his son, a Standard II student of Centre Point School, Wardhaman Nagar. They killed Yug by smothering him on September 1, 2014 and buried his body in sand near a culvert on the desolate Gumthi-Gumthala Road near Patansawangi village, 27 kms away from Nagpur. In all 26 injuries were found on Yug’s body, most of them on or near the neck.
