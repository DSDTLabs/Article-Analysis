LUCKNOW/KANPUR: On a day of political analogies in battleground UP, Prime Minister   and chief minister   Yadav engaged in a verbal duel charging each other with ‘scamming’ UP’s electorate. On the one hand, Modi, while addressing audiences at a public rally in Meerut, redefined SCAM as ‘Samajwadi, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati’ and said the   was fighting against these four forces in poll-bound UP.

 On the other, Akhilesh, holding back-to-back poll rallies in Kanpur Dehat and Auraiyya, came up with his own counter analogy to Modi’s version. Asking the crowds not to fall for the BJP’s promise of “acche din”, the UP CM said, “Scam means, Save the Country from Amitshah, Modi.”
 
 By evening, ‘SCAM’ appeared to have caught the imagination of the  , which followed with another long-form version of the word: “Sirf Communal Amitshah-Modi”. Addressing a rally in Auraiyya, Akhilesh said people of UP will do away with AM —Amit and   in the elections. “People will send this AM back,” he said.
 
 Earlier in the day, PM Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah had led sharp attacks on the Akhilesh Yadavled UP government and held it responsible for the deteriorating law and order conditions in UP. Denying the charge of a breakdown of law and order in UP, Akhilesh hit back at the BJP, asking the party to look at president Amit Shah and state chief Keshav Prasad Maurya’s “criminal pasts”. Akhilesh said, “People who are questioning law and order should look at their national president and their state president-...they were charged under so many sections.”
