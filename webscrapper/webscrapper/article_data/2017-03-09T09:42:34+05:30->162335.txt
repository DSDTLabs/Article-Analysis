JAIPUR: A total allocation of Rs 596.82 crore has been proposed for the development of tribal areas by chief minister Vasundhara Raje on Thursday, with special focus on developing educational facilities for tribal students.

 There are 30 hostels for students from tribal communities in the state. The schools are sometimes about 2km away from these hostels. To ease the commute of students, the state government has decided to provide cycles.
 
 Students in classes 10 and 12 from backward and tribal communities will also receive career-counselling services. For the purpose, counsellors will be drawn from the ranks of staff at the Tribal Research Institute and other state agencies.
 
 The intake of students at the Eklavya Model Residential School in Tonk will be increased from the current 350 to 480. Similarly, in the coming year, the capacity of two hostels for college students at Dungarpur and Banswara will be increased by 50 students each.
 
 The government will also spend Rs 44.79 crore to construct additional classrooms, laboratories and other facilities at 23 schools in Banswara, 25 in Dungarpur, 11 in Udaipur and 15 in Pratapgarh.
 
 Among other proposals in the Budget for tribal communities, the government seeks to construct 11 new anicuts Banswara eight in Pratapgarh. It will also renovate and expand the capacity of water channels in Udaipur.
 
 It has earmarked Rs 10.14 crore for solar-powered lift mechanisms for community irrigation facilities in Dungarpur, Pratapgarh and Banswara.
 
 There is also a proposal to provide employment for 5,200 people from tribal groups.
