Surat: The standing committee of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) approved the amended parking policy for Surat on Thursday evening. The amendment allows a person to own a car even without having parking space for the vehicle.

 BJP, which controls SMC, had set up a four-member committee to suggest amendments to the draft policy prepared by the officials. The committee headed by Nirav Shah had recently submitted its report to the SMC. The committee proposed parking zone on roads wider that 12 metres and that the responsibility of illegally parked vehicle be solely that of its owner. If a vehicle is left at a public place for more than 48 hours without intimation to the authorities concerned, the police would be asked to take action. The committee also recommends sharing of parking space with housing societies for which NOC of respective presidents would be taken. 
 
 The rates for parking would be fixed according to premium area and also space a vehicle will take. Premium rates would be applicable in commercial areas of the city. 
 
 SMC standing committee chairman Rajesh Desai said, “This policy would help people and administration to bring an order to parking of vehicles in the city. We expect people to comply with the new policy.” 
 
 The BJP has done away with many penal provisions which were there in the draft policy. May be this is due to the upcoming assembly elections.
