GHAZIABAD: A 50-year-old man and his 18-year-old son died after inhaling poisonous gas from the   of their house in  ,  , while trying to clean it on the night of Friday. The youth’s brother is also admitted to a hospital in Meerut in an unconscious state.

 The incident took place when the family had called two workers to clean the tank but the workers started losing consciousness. The victims, Maksood (50) and his son Mehboob (18), then pulled out the workers and tried to do the cleaning on their own instead.
 
 Maksood, a vegetable vendor, lived in Nawab Nagar, Modinagar, with his three sons. 
 
 According to the police, the lack of a gas pipeline required to release poisonous gaseous substances in the septic tank chamber would have been the cause of death. However, the postmortem report is awaited for further clarity. 
 
 Dhruv Bhushan Dubey, SHO, Modinagar police station, said, “The victim’s family members wanted to get their defecation tank cleaned. They hired two safai karamcharis to do the job for them, but as soon as they went into the tank, both of them started falling unconscious. At that point, Maksood and his sons waiting outside pulled them back and Maksood and Mehboob went inside to clean the tank. But they also fainted.”
 
 Dubey said that Mehboob’s elder brother, Sehboob (20), who was watching over them from the tank opening, also fell unconscious after inhaling some poisonous gas emanating from the tank.
 
 “The space in the tank was really narrow and all three of them got trapped. Their neighbours had to dig around the tank hole to pull them out,” Dubey said.
 
 All the three victims were taken to Jeevan Hospital, Modinagar, where Maksood and Mehboob were declared brought dead while Sehboob was referred to a Meerut hospital.
 
 Sources told TOI that this part of   did not have sewer lines because of which septic tanks are a necessity and need to be cleaned periodically.
