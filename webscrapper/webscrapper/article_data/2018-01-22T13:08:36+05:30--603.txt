THANJAVUR: As the Maratha kingdom has historic connections with Thanjavur in both culture and trade, rail users have urged the railway minister to introduce a new express train between Thanjavur and Mumbai via   and Kumbakonam. 

 Babaji Bhonsle, the current head of the Maratha royal family of Thanjavur, continues to be the hereditary trustee of the Devasthanam palace which administers 88 temples including the Big Temple in Thanjavur, established by Chola King Rajarajan I in 1010 AD. 
 
 Further, the district has commercial links with Pune and Mumbai. Natives of this Agrarian district have migrated to Mumbai for employment and business, in large numbers. In lieu of the demand, major stations in the district such as Thanjavur, Kumbakonam and Mayiladuthurai had a separate quota for Mumbai trains from Chennai Central during the erstwhile manual reservation era itself.
 
 In a representation submitted to railway minister   by T Saravana, secretary of the Train Passengers Association, A Giri, secretary of the Thanjavur District Rail Users Committee, and D Sathyanarayanan, secretary of the   in Kumbakonam, through Mumbai MLA Captain  , they stated that stainless steel utensils and brass ware parcel bookings from Kumbakonam to Tirupathi and Mumbai was done in good numbers when meter gauge trains were operated on the sector.
