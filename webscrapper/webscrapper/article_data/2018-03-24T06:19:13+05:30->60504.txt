KOLKATA: On Sunday, television professional   drove from Taratala to Kasba to check out if any pub could supply him with a bottle of beer. But he returned empty-handed. In another part of the city, entrepreneur   wanted to drive all the way from   to Talshari because someone had informed him about beer being available there. 

 Designer  , who had also failed in the quest, then started the #beerbiplab campaign on social media demanding immediate supply of her favourite drink.
 
 All of them are now sharing their beer woes and posting nostalgia-laced photos with beer bottles. Designer Ajopa Mukherjee, who has put up quite a few such photos with the tag #beerbiplab, said: “Sipping beer when I get home from work is a habit. But now it is only available at places like Beer Republic and Grid, which have microbreweries. But they are too far from my Naktala house. This draught is making me irritable,” Mukherjee said.
 
 Her sister – actor Swastika Mukherjee – came to her rescue when she obtained four bottles of beer from a liquor shop in Golf Green. She had been standing in queue where everyone was refused beer. Fortunately, the owner was a family acquaintance and a fan of actor Shantu Mukherjee. He took her aside and gave her four bottles. “My sister rushed home and we took sips as if we were having prasad during Pujas,” Mukherjee said.
 
 Dasgupta feels loyalty comes in handy in such situations. “Since I go to a pub regularly, I bought five bottles in advance and asked them to serve them to only me. The owner refused others while I was given this privilege,” Dasgupta said.
 
 According to Banerjee, for many, getting a bottle of beer is also about having bragging rights. “Flaunting a beer bottle now is like showing off a ticket for the IPL finals. However, the good news is that beer supply is expected to resume soon,” said Banerjee.
