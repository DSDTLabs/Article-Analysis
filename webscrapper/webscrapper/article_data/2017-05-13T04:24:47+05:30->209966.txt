NEW DELHI: Welcoming the Delhi high court’s refusal to stay income tax proceedings against a company involving   leaders Sonia and  , BJP maintained that the matter was of probity in public life and Congress leaders should cooperate with the investigation.

 “Their ( ) lawyer says they will move the  . They can do as they wish but they must remember that this involves a serious ethical and moral issue. 
 
 There is an important question of propriety. Democracy runs on public morality,” law minister   said on Friday. He suggested that it would be in the Gandhis' interest if they cooperated with income tax authorities in the probe.
 
 Prasad alleged that  , a Congress-run newspaper, had become a “family concern”, something which had not happened during the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, who had floated the paper.
 
 Citing the HC order and several cases of alleged shady deals involving leaders like Lalu Prasad, Prasad took dig at opposition parties’ efforts to forge an anti-BJP alliance. “The opposition has not learnt lessons from recent defeats.
 
 It is ironic that even after three years of NDA regime, corruption cases involving opposition parties continue to surface,” he said, adding, “People have faith in the   government because they believe it is running honestly and with probity.”
