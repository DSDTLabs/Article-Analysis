ROHTAK: In view of Jats’ open warning against the entry of   MP Raj Kumari Saini in villages under their influence, the Jhajjar district administration has declined permission to the Brahmin community to invite the parliamentarian to attend the Parsuram Jayanti at   village. The event is scheduled for Sunday.

 Kadiyan Khap held a meeting at   on Friday and declared that it won’t let Saini enter the 12 villages under its influence at any cost.
 
 Davinder Pradhan, head of Kadiyan Khap, said they had decided that they had no issue about any political party or leader barring Saini. “We are not against anyone. But we can’t forget that violence had taken place during the February 2016 Jat agitation for reservation all because of Saini. He has not mended his ways and continued to attack the community without any provocation. We will not let him enter the area to spoil the brotherhood again,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Kadiyan Khap also submitted a memorandum to Jhajjar deputy commissioner   with the request not to give permission for Saini’s visit to Dubaldhan.
 
 On the other hand, members of the Brahmin community, under All-India Brahmin Mahasangh, had also met the DC and submitted a memorandum demanding security for their event.
 
 Samsher Kaushik, head of mahasangh, said they wanted to hold the event with the permission of the administration, but some persons were throwing spanner in the works for their vested interests. He said they had demanded strict action against such persons as no one can stop an elected representative in entering any place in a democratic setup. He said the event would take place at the scheduled time on May 27 at Dubaldhan.
 
 DC Goyal said there was tension in the area as both communities were adamant on their stance. “Based on the report submitted by district police, I have declined to give permission to organisers to invite MP Saini so that there is no law and order situation in the area,” she said.
