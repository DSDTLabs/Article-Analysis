CHENNAI: Coming to aid of thousands of dog owners, breeders and traders,   has restrained officials from seizing dogs kept and bred by them under the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Dog Breeding and Marketing) Rules, 2017 notified by the central government on May 23. 

 On May 23, the Centre had issued a notification bringing to force the rules and said breeder such as an individual or a group of persons who own dogs of specific breeds for breeding and sale of dogs and pups, should obtain a licence renewable every three years, and also maintain dogstay as prescribed in the rules. Assailing its legality, Kennel Club of India moved the court to quash the notification, and to stay its operation as an interim relief.
 
 On Wednesday, passing orders on the PIL, the first bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice M  , said: “Since vires of the central Rule is under challenge, notice be issued to the additional solicitor-general of India (southern region), through the additional solicitor general of India ( ). For a period of two weeks or until further orders, whichever is earlier, there will be an order of interim injunction restraining the authorities from taking away any domestic dog or pup temporarily kept by its owner, in a kennel operated by a dog breeding kennel operator.” The bench posted further hearing on July 24.
 
 The PIL said definition in the rules was abysmally wide, and added: “Any person who keeps a fertile pedigreed pure breed dog, bitch for love of the breed and takes progeny out of it, however occasionally, would be covered by the definition of the breeder under these rules.”
 
 Moreover, the word breeder cannot mean and include boarding kennel operator, intermediate handler or trader.
 
 These totally different occupations have been inaccurately and incorrectly clubbed together under the word breeder in the impugned rules, which is totally absurd preposterous arbitrary and unreasonable.
