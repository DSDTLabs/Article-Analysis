KOHIMA: In a bid to unite all  , chief minister   on Friday said his government would meet various groups and hold talks with them. 

 He added that his government had been playing the role of a facilitator so long and it was time it became more aggressive, he said. 
 
 Acknowledging Prime Minister Narendra Modi's desire to solve the Naga political problem,   said it was time for all to work hard to achieve that breakthrough.
 
 Liezietsu took over the reigns of the state on February 22 and will present the state budget on March 28. 
 
 On the India-Myanmar border fencing, the chief minister said, "The India-Myanmar boundary cuts right across the eastern Naga homeland. So, even if we can't do much at the moment to change the international border, we will do everything possible to see that the traditional right of the Nagas to move about freely within their own ancestral land is not taken away or unduly restricted." 
 
 He added that 'attempts to divide the Nagas will have an adverse effect on peace and security in the border areas'.
 
 He said, "With our collective effort and with the Centre's support, we have been able to convince Myanmar to stop fencing work. We will continue to make efforts to see that the border fencing project is not only stopped, but completely abandoned."
 
 On the recent violence over the urban local body (ULB) polls in the state, the chief minister said it was necessary that proper dialogue and discussions were held on this sensitive issue. 
 
 Since the ULB polls, held in the early part of the year, had been declared null and void, the state government would now initiate dialogue and consultation on this issue to arrive at a broad consensus, he added. 
 
 Later, the house adopted a motion by voice-vote and speaker   adjourned the assembly till March 28.
