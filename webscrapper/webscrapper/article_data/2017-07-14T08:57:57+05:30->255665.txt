LUCKNOW: Besides the  , lakes in the city are also getting polluted by   during  , said a recent inspection by the UP Pollution Control Board. The UPPCB inspected the   in Telibagh,   in Aishbagh and Butler lake at Butler Palace to assess condition of the water body and found that not only sewerage from nearby localities, even municipal waste including plastic trash was being dumped into the lakes from the past several years. 

 At Moti Jheel, the team found encroachments of various kinds in the surroundings of the lake, such as remains from a nearby cremation ground which are dumped on a regular basis. About 70% lake is covered with sewer sludge and watercress. Those residing in the vicinity said the lake has become a nuisance for them. "It is more of a nullah now, giving out a terrible stench and mosquitoes breed on the dirty water," said Viresh, a resident near Moti Jheel.
 
 Similar is the condition of Butler Lake. The water body is right in the middle of a colony with houses all around it. "Once the lake used to be the best part of the colony but with time it became a nuisance as instead of water there are heaps of trash rotting in it, creating an awful stench all the time and we avoid opening windows facing the lake," said Adarsh Chauhan, a retired school teacher who resides in the colony. 
 
 Residents of the area said several complaints have been made to the district administration but there is no result. "We even requested authorities to cover the water body if they cannot maintain it properly because anyway it is no better than a nullah now," said Shashank Kumar, another resident.
 
 The inspection report has been sent to the Lucknow Development Authority and immediate action has been instructed by UPPCB. Taking cognizance of the report, LDA VC P N Singh said, "I have asked the LDA secretary to take strict and speedy steps towards removing encroachment to get these water bodies cleaned."
