BHOPAL: Police used water cannons to disperse the protesting Congress workers as they were proceeding towards the Char Imli bungalow of Madhya Pradesh home minister   here on Thursday.

 More than a dozen party works, including the state   president   were arrested, though they were released later. “The protest was organised against the increasing incidents of misbehaviour by BJP leaders not only with the people in general but also with the government officials,” Choudhry said. Slogan shouting Congress workers were stopped near JP Hospital when they tried to proceed towards Char Imli. “The BJP leaders in the state seem to be intoxicated by power and have been taking law in their hands,” he said.
 
 Protesters trying to push past barricades on the road leading to the Char Imli were turned back by the police, using water hoses. Treading cautiously after the last month’s agitation that led to injuries to MP Congress president  , the police used   this time. There was no lathicharge. As the water was sprayed with great force, the Congress workers ran for cover. Some of them fell down as they tried to escape it.
 
 Later, talking to the media, district Congress president PC Sharma condemned the government. “Peaceful protest is the right of the opposition in democracy, but the government believes in trampling the rights. The BJP workers and leaders have unleashed a reign of terror in MP and we will continue to oppose this,” he said.
