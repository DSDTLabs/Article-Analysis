MEERUT: Police seized a CD allegedly containing   from BJP MLA Sangeet Som’s election campaign vehicle from   in Meerut’s Sardhana area. A case was filed against the driver of the election campaign vehicle and the person who took permission for the vehicle for violating section 144 CrPc. Police sources say that the CD contained clippings of the clashes that took place in Kawal village of Muzaffarnagar where a minor altercation between Hindu and Muslim youth had snowballed into the riots in 2013.
 
 Meerut district magistrate B. Chandrakala said, “We got a complaint from a source that a CD with clippings of Muzaffarnagar riots is being played on the election campaign vehicle of   in Sardhana area. I immediately called up the sub-divisional magistrate of Sardhana to look into the matter, who further informed police and seized the CD from the spot.”
  Soon after the information reached the police, officials reached the spot and seized the CD from the driver of the election campaign vehicle, which had a screen attached to it and was used for broadcasting clippings in rural areas ahead of UP polls.
  Chandra Pal Singh, circle officer, Sardhana, said, “The CD has been seized from the spot and a case under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of Indian Penal Code has been filed against Birendra Singh, the driver, and Chandrashekhar Singh – who took permission from the   – for violating norms.”
  The CD is in the possession of police as of now and it will be duly screened to check for all the violations it makes.
  “The screening of the CD will be done by the police on Wednesday and sections will be added to the FIR accordingly. As of now, no case is there on Sangeet Som but if any laxity on his part is found, a case will be filed against him too,” said Singh.
  When TOI contacted BJP MLA Sangeet Som, he said, “We had taken all the permissions from the election commission. The CD did not contain any clippings of Muzaffarnagar riots.”
