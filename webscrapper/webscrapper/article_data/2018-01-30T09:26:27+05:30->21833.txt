JAMMU: The Jammu and Kashmir government is planning to introduce several new subjects, including Islamic, Buddhist and Vedic Studies, in the school curriculum, education minister Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari informed the Legislative Council today.

 He said that introduction of new subjects necessitates creation of teaching posts. And as the creation of teaching posts has financial implications -- recurring as well as non- recurring, any such proposal needs the prior concurrence of the finance department and the approval of the state cabinet.
 
 The minister said that during the current year, a proposal for the introduction of various subjects, including Islamic, Buddhist and Vedic Studies, Tourism and Microbiology were referred to the finance department.
 
 But the finance department has expressed its inability to create posts of lecturers due to scarcity of resources, he said. Only the introduction of Microbiology in the curriculum at the 12th standard is under its consideration.
 
 The minister was responding to a Calling Attention Notice by MLC Naresh Kumar Gupta.
 
 He said the school education department has already initiated the process for introduction of some more subjects including Bio-Resources, Bio-Chemistry, Biotechnology, Business Administration, Fisheries, Library Science, Public Administration, Rural Development, Mass Communication, Statistics, Electronics, and Information Technology in the curriculum.
