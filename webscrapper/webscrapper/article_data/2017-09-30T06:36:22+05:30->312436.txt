AHMEDABAD: At a time when the   has included   forests in its November tiger census, a PIL in the   high court has complained that the forest cover is being illegally stripped away. 

 The PIL was filed on Friday by a retired forester,  . It seeks an investigation into the removal of the green cover and urges action against those responsible for damaging the   area in Dang district. Desai has also complained of large-scale theft of wood from the forest department’s custody. He cited an instance in which the stolen wood was worth Rs 1.35 crore.
 
 The high court has sought a reply from the state government by November 8.
 
  The petitioner said that while he was posted as an assistant conservator of forests in Dang, he noticed people — including forest officials —systematically cutting down trees. He cited an example of 455 trees being chopped in 2014 and the wood being put on sale by the forest department.
 
 The petitioner has highlighted how green trees were girdled and left to dry and later cut down.
 
  The Wildlife Protection Act completely prohibits cutting of trees in protected sanctuaries. The petitioner’s advocate, Vijay Nangesh, argued that due to the steady depletion of the forest cover, ecological balance was being disrupted in the area. Instances of human-animal conflict are also rising, he said.
