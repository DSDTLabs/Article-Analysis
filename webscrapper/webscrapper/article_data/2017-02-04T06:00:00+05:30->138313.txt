Visakhapatnam: Culture, tradition and inheritance of AP should be upheld through festivals and   is showcasing this to the world, said Union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu.

 Addressing the audience at the inauguration of Visakha Utsav at RK Beach on Friday, the Union minister urged the people to be aware of the state’s traditions through this festival for the development of the district. “The central government has decided to provide Rs 2.2 lakh crore package to AP to develop it as a strong state. Many national-level educational institutions have been allotted and the Polavaram project has been recognised as a national project,” he added.
 
 He appreciated the recently concluded partnership summit in the city where around Rs 10.5 lakh crore worth of MoUs were signed. “Navratna companies have expressed interest to invest Rs 6.5 lakh crore which will help in the state’s development through industries and also provide large scale employment. The state will witness a great change once the proposed road widening projects, petro-corridor, and housing projects come into reality,” the minister said. 
 
 Union minister Y Sujana Chowdary also appreciated the state government’s efforts to organise various festivals to protect the culture and traditions. AP Assembly speaker Kodela Siva Prasada Rao and information and technology minister Palle Raghunatha Reddy said India’s culture and traditions have a great recognition and protecting them through festivals such as Visakha Utsav will enhance patriotism and nationalism. 
 
 Prior to the inauguration, a carnival on Beach Road was launched by the ministers and various troupes and students exhibited their skills. 
 
 However, Friday being a weekday, lack of local crowd was visible and the gap was filled by students from various schools and colleges.
