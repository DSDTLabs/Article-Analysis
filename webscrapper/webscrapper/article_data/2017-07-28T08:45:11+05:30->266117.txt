LUCKNOW: Traffic crawled in the areas around   following massive protest by 'Shiksha mitras' near   and   state headquarters on Thursday. 

 They were raising demand for their adjustment after the Supreme Court quashed their induction as assistant teachers.
 
 Hundreds of them from adjoining districts like Hardoi, Sitapur, Kanpur, Rae Bareli had come to stage a sit-in at the BJP office, which had a cascading effect on Hazratganj and its neighbouring areas and paralysed the movement of traffic from 10 am to 3pm.
 
 The traffic remained paralysed on Ashok Marg, Lalbagh, Kaiserbagh and Hazratganj crossing. Many school vans, ambulances were seen stuck in the jam for several hours.
 
 "We were forced to step out of our school van and walk to reach home following a jam near Ganj crossing," said Mohammed Asad, a student of Class X.
 
 "It is so frustrating, protest taking place at such an important place. I had to catch a flight to Guwahati, but I got stranded in the traffic for over an hour," said Kishore Nigam of Darul Shafa.
 
 Parul Srivastava told TOI that she had gone to pick her child from   but on way back she got stuck at Lalbagh. "There was no traffic cop to manage the flow, we remained stuck for nearly two hours that even made me faint," Srivastava told TOI. 
 
 ASP (East) Sarvesh Mishra told TOI that every day there is a protest and it is very difficult to deal with the limited manpower. "We tried our best to keep the traffic moving," Mishra told TOI.
