CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister   said on Tuesday that law and order in the state was under control and that issues raised by protesting Jats would be resolved after the second round of talks.

  “We are hopeful of a solution, possibly without much problem. At the same time, we are prepared for the worst. Come what may, there will be no violence,” Khattar said after chairing a meeting of the Haryana cabinet at Surajkund in Faridabad.
 
 Khattar’s reaction came after a five-member core committee of Haryana government officers headed by chief secretary D S Dhesi updated the cabinet about their interaction with Jat leaders in Panipat and issues raised by them. “The cabinet has given a patient hearing to the committee members and discussed ground reports, including inputs by intelligence agencies. We are preparing for a second round of talks and are hopeful of resolving the issue at the earliest,” an official from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.
 
 An intelligence input, meanwhile, triggered panic in the CMO. According to the report, the number of youngsters and women at protest venues in eight districts has gone up.
 
 A communication by a superintendent of police (SP)-level officer in the crime investigation department (CID), the intelligence wing of Haryana Police, has advised all districts’ SPs to give police headquarters minute-to-minute updates of all protest venues.
 
 Even as All India Jat   (AIJASS) chief   has reiterated that protests would remain peaceful till their demands were accepted, the government has taken intelligence inputs seriously and directed SPs to act accordingly.
 
 According to the intelligence report, barring Mewat and Panchkula, the situation in other districts is “quite alarming”. The report has also sounded alert about youths being equipped with lathis, other blunt weapons and tools, and presence of “unscrupulous” elements with agitators.
