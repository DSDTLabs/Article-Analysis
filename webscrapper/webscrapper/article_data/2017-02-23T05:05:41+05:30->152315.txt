SURAT: A large number of anganwadi and Asha workers staged a gherao at Limbayat MLA Sangita Patil’s office on Wednesday. They are not happy with their wage hike. This is also a fallout of the ongoing tussle between two sets of politicians in  . After the suspension of   on Sunday, this battle is likely to heat up ahead of the assembly elections. 

 Anganwadi workers were getting a monthly wage of Rs 4,700, which was raised to Rs 5,500 in this state budget. Similarly, Asha workers’ monthly salary of Rs 2,500 was raised to Rs 3,500. 
 
 Not satisfied with this nearly 15 per cent increase, anaganwadi workers took out a rally and staged a gherao at Patil’s Limbayat office on Wednesday morning shouting slogans against her and Navsari MP C R Paatil. 
 
 Patil, who is in   for assembly session, said, “They had come earlier too and I had then assured them that their salaries would be hiked in this budget. Now, if they are not happy they must come and meet me when I am present in my office. What’s the point of this protest in my absence. It seems someone must have sent them purposely.” 
 
 After suspension of Ravindra Patil, it is clear that a tussle between two sets of politicians from BJP has started in Limbayat and would continue till assembly elections.
 
 A senior politician from the city said, “When there is no protest rally anywhere else in the state, the one at Limbayat MLA’s office says many things. It looks this will intensify in future.” 
 
 Ravindra Patil was suspended after he invited state   chief Bharatsinh Solanki for   celebration last week.
