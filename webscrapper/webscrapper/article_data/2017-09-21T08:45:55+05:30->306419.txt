HYDERABAD: The Defence Estate Office, Telangana circle, and Local Military Authority ( ) on Tuesday received a communication from the  , ( ), Delhi, confirming that the ministry of defence (MoD) agreed in principle to allot   and Gymkhana Ground to the Telangana government for construction of Secretariat.

 In the absence of any communication to the two local military wings till recently left some doubt among some circles about the state government's claim about the MoD agreeing to part with the land belonging to the two grounds for a new Secretariat complex.
 
 On Tuesday, the LMA and Defence Estate Office received a one line communication from the DGDE, Delhi stating, "MoD has agreed in principle to allot Bison Polo Ground and Gymkhana Ground to Telangana.' Confirming this, highlyplaced defence sources told TOI, "we will submit the copy of the letter to the high court after   vacation."
 
 Though the MoD has agreed in-principle to allot the land to Telangana, the Union cabinet has to take a final decision. Any land belonging to Army and Defence in the country, comes under DGDE's purview.
 
 The MoD has two options to claim compensation for parting with Bison Polo and Gymkhana. It can either seek land for land or settle for cash payment. The nitty-gritty of this important aspect will be worked out by the Union cabinet, sources said.
 
 Both grounds are reclassified as 'C' land (Secunderabad Cantonment land) and the decision to allot it was left to the civic body. Though SCB members were positive to the state government's proposal, LMA was not keen initially because it would lose a huge chunk of land which is being used for imparting training to soldiers and organising exhibition of arms and weapons.
