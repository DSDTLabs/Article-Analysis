NAGPUR: As part of a nationwide protest supported by the   (IMA), over 200 medical students on Wednesday held a protest meeting and demonstrations against the proposed National Exit Test (NEXT). 

 The exit test is being proposed by an amendment to the Indian Medical Council (IMC) Act for MBBS students.
 
 IMA president Dr   said, “This is in contradiction with the   simplifying the admission process and allowing admission only through NEET. 
 
 “The ministry of health and family welfare is trying to complicate situation by proposing this change through IMA Act. This is totally uncalled for and IMA is supporting the protesting students across India.” 
 
 Dr YS Deshpande, state IMA president-elect, told TOI that as a mark of protest MBBS students in all colleges abstained from classes from 9 am to 1 pm and submitted a charter of demands to the divisional commissioner.
