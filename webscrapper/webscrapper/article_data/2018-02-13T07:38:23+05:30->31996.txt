LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s call to make all roads of the state pothole-free doesn’t seem to hold priority in Lucknow Municipal Corporation’s development agenda.

 The civic body, in its budget proposal for financial year 2018-19 on Monday, allocated Rs 30 crore less as compared to previous year for repair of roads and drains in the state capital. This financial year, LMC had earmarked Rs 90 crore for the repair and strengthening of infrastructure. This has been slashed to Rs 60 crore for the upcoming year.
 
 The sources say that the LMC is facing tight budget this year owing to the poor tax collection, hence it has cut down on allocation towards infrastructure repairs. The budget for FY 2019 was announced by mayor Sanyukta Bhatia in LMC’s executive committee meeting on Monday.
 
 As per PWD standard, the concretized roads get worn out and tattered every five years. Since Lucknow has 3,000 km of total road network, going by the standard, LMC should repair around 600 km of road every year. The average cost of repairing 1 km of road is around Rs 60 lakh, said a PWD engineer.
 
 This implies that LMC needs around Rs 360 crore every year for repairing city roads. However, the new budget allocates just one sixth of the required amount.
 
 Because of the  , LMC has also announced that from FY 2019 onward, all big and small drains would be cleaned by LMC staff instead of giving cleaning contracts to private contractors. To save on road repair cost, mayor also directed that if the government and private companies were seen cutting roads without depositing road restoration fee with the LMC or not concretizing the road after construction gets over, LMC would take legal action on the company.
