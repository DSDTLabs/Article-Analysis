The rape survivor was brought from   to Lucknow on Monday by a four-member   team to record her statement.

 After coming out from the special CBI court, the survivor told media persons “justice will be done” and that “she has full faith in the work of the CBI”. The girl, her mother and brother were then taken back to the hotel in Unnao where they have been put up by the district administration.
 
 The survivor arrived at the court at about 12 noon. She gave her statements to judicial magistrate Sapna Tripathi between 2 pm to 5pm. The CBI recorded the survivor’s statement under Section 164 of CrPc, as part of the investigation of the first FIR on the alleged rape. The survivor has alleged that she was lured by her neighbour Shashi Singh and then allegedly raped by MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar. The CBI had registered three FIRs in the case on April 12.
 
 Sources privy to the probe said that the girl was produced before a judicial magistrate on Monday where she had given the statements about the events on June 4 in 2017. The CBI team will now match the statements and then cross-examine the accused MLA and Shashi Singh. The location of the accused MLA and Shashi Singh on that particular date and time as stated by the survivor in her statement will be checked by the CBI team. The CBI has already been granted police remand of Shashi Singh and MLA Sengar.
 
 The CBI teams will also take the   MLA and Shashi Singh to the spot during reconstruction of the crime scene. A senior official also said that there were some serious concerns about the safety and security of the accused and her family members. “As a result, we are not taking them to the spot for reconstruction. We need a foolproof security. Maybe we will seek assistance of a central agency for making these arrangements,” he added.
