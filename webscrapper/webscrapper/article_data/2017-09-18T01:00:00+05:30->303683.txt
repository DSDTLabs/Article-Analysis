Shraddha Kapoor’s intense act as  , evident in the 'Haseena Parkar' trailer has become a talking point. Her effort to slip into the role of a lady ganglord in the film, co-produced by   and Babu Tyagi, produced by Nahid Khan, has been applauded. Few would know that Dawood Ibrahim’s sister had a different life before she became the infamous ‘Aapa’. It was her husband Ibrahim Parkar’s murder that changed the course of her life.
While filming his death sequence for the film that releases on September 22, Shraddha was required to carry her co-star  , who plays her husband Ibrahim, on her shoulders. And although the team suggested that she use a body double, she insisted on performing it on her own. Ankur stands tall at 6.2 ft and is well-built. However, Shraddha ferried him on her shoulders for the scene which is a turning point in the film. The scene surprised director Apoorva Lakhia and left her co-star stumped.
