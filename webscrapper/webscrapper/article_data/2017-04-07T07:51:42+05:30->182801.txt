VADODARA:Even as parents are in no mood to pay up the fees as demanded by  , the Vadodara Unaided Private School Association (VUPSA) which comprises of 54 schools , has said that they need to collect fees as per their routine pattern. 

 For the first time after the   recently passed the Regulations of  , 2017 that has capped the school fees collected by private schools across the state, VUPSA on Wednesday issued a release welcoming the act. 
 
 In a statement, the association said that it is waiting for government resolution, the formation of fee   and approval of fees of individual schools. 
 
 “In absence of any official communication from government regarding the amount of fees that can be charged, we advise parents to pay the first instalment of the fees for the academic year 2017-18 as intimated by the individual schools,” VUPSA’s statement said. 
 
 “As and when the fee committee is formed and individual fees are approved, the final approved amount will be communicated to parents by the schools. If there is any kind of monetary difference between the fees charged and fees approved, the same will be adjusted in the next payable fee instalment,” it said. The association said that Rs 15,000, Rs 25,000 and Rs 27,000 for primary, secondary and higher secondary – the upper limits fixed through the Act are not fees but only cut off limits to separate those schools that need to have their fees approved by the fee committee from those that do not need approval of fee committee. “Schools charging below this limit need not have their fees approved by the fee committee,” it said. 
 
 Parents of Cygnus World School, Harni who have already submitted a formal complaint to the district education officer, have decided that on Thursday they will approach the school management with an offer that they are ready to pay fees as capped by the Act while they will be paying the excess amount approved by the fee regulatory committee in the next instalment.
