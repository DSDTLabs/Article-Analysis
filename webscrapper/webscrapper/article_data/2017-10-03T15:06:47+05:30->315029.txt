NAGPUR: On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday, the Youth Congress on Monday launched a novel mass-contact programme ‘Tapri-pe-charcha’ (tea stalls conversation) to mobilize public opinion against   government at the Centre and the state. The first venue for it was a tea stall near RSS headquarters in Mahal.

 This is the brainchild of   faction in the party that is now charting its own programmes to attract support and revive the party. Such meetings will now be held regularly across the city. Besides Chaturvedi, former minister Anees Ahmed, former MP Gev Awari, former MLA Ashok Dhawad, leader of the opposition in NMC Tanaji Vanve were present for the function organized by youth leader Bunty Shelke.
 
 ‘Tapri-pe charcha’ is an answer to Narendra Modi’s ‘Chai pe harcha’ meets he had launched before 2014 elections to interact with the masses. Congress leaders are hoping to build up an anti-Modi mood in the city through such meetings.
 
 Even while remembering Mahatma Gandhi and former PM   on their birthday, the city Congress remained a divided house. The city Congress official function was held near Gandhi statue at   in which former MP Vilas Muttemwar and his protégé and city president Vilas Thakre were present. The Chaturvedi faction held its programme at Chitar Oil. 
 
 Muttemwar, addressing a modest crowd, said the religiously intolerant who felt insecure with the teachings of unity and equality killed the Mahatma. But, he said, the Gandhian thought was universal and immortal. Senior social worker   said Gandhi’s teachings were more relevant today to understand the emerging political situation in the country. The city has decided to intensify agitation against price-rise by holding demonstrations at petrol pumps on Wednesday.
