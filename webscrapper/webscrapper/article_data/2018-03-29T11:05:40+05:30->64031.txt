NAGPUR: The wait for Nagpur Metro is finally over. Commissioner of   (CMRS) has decided to inspect the at grade section of Metro on April 6 and 7. MahaMetro expects the commissioner to issue the certificate within 15 days so that commercial operations can begin by April end.

 CMRS is an agency under ministry of civil aviation that inspects all aspects of a Metro rail project and then issues a certificate. Commercial operations of   are not allowed without CMRS nod. Apart from Metro projects, CMRS also inspects new railway projects. 
 
 The trial run of at grade section was held on September 30. Since then, MahaMetro has been trying to get the required clearances from Research Design and   (RDSO) and CMRS.
 
 A team from CMRS office had visited Nagpur on January 16 and expressed satisfaction over the system. The CMRS Arvind Kumar Jain had raised some queries and promised to conduct second inspection in February. However, this got delayed due to various reasons.
 
 A source in MahaMetro said Jain and his team was slated to come for second inspection in the last week of March. “However, the team is on a four-day visit to   to inspect the gauge conversion work of   section. We hope the team will come in the second week of April. MahaMetro is fully ready with its preparations for commercial operations and just needs CMRS nod,” he added.
 
 MahaMetro had done a self-trial by installing an oscillation monitoring system (OMS) and sent the results to RDSO, a ministry of railways undertaking. RDSO took its own time but finally issued the speed certificate on December 4. The speed certificate was submitted to CMRS for forwarding it to the  . 
 
 Meanwhile, work is going on in full swing on the three Metro stations of at grade section — Khapri, New Airport and Airport South. MahaMetro officials expect them to be fully ready by the time joyrides are started. As on date, all passenger amenities are available at the stations and only interior decoration work is going on.
