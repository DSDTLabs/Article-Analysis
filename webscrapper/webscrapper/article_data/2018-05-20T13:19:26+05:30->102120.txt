SURAT: Decomposed bodies of a 25-year-old woman and a five-year-old boy were found in a rivulet near a farmland in   area of the city on Saturday. 

 The bodies which were found in a plastic bag were discovered by labourers while they were dismantling a borewell digging machinery near the place. 
 
 Police are trying to verify if the bodies are that of a woman and her son who had gone missing from   10 days ago. The woman’s husband is missing too. Police are checking if he had killed the two and then disappeared.
 
 The bodies are completely decomposed and hence police have not been able to identify them so far. Police have information about a woman and her son of similar age missing from Pandesara since May 8. Police suspect the woman and the boy had died around 10 days ago. Police are getting DNA profiling of the deceased done to confirm if they were mother and son. 
 
 “We are working to ascertain the identities of the woman and the boy. We are checking if the bodies are of the woman and her son who had gone missing from Pandesara on May 8. Investigations are on to identify the people involved in their murders,” city police commissioner   said. 
 
 Police have registered an offence of murder and started investigations even as the bodies were sent for postmortem.
 
 “The woman’s husband is missing after he lodged a missing report with police. He is our prime suspect as of now,” Sharma said.
 
 Police are not revealing the identity details of the missing woman, her husband and son because the investigations are on. The Pandesara woman’s husband is suspected to have escaped to his native place. The family was not from  , police informed.
