LUCKNOW: With SP-Congress pact sealed on Sunday, the focus is now on   chief   who is relying on Muslim votes to return to power in UP. Mayawati has given 97 tickets to Muslims, the maximum allottment to the community ever by her party, to stitch a formidable Dalit-Muslim combination against the BJP. 

 The SP-Congress alliance, political experts said, could wean away some Muslim votes which Mayawati may have consolidated after the SP feud broke out. Mayawati has been trying to drive a wedge in the SP camp by pitting the warring camps of Akhilesh and his uncle   against each other, while appealing to Muslims to vote for BSP en-bloc. BSP leaders, however, maintained that the SP-Congress alliance will not affect their party. “We have moved far ahead of our rivals in reaching out to voters of all communities,” said a BSP functionary. BSP supremo Mayawati will launch her poll campaign from Meerut on February 1, following it with rallies in   and Pilibhit on February 4. Political commentator   said Mayawati’s core Dalit vote base could still drive Muslims to vote in favour of the BSP to arrest the surge of BJP.
