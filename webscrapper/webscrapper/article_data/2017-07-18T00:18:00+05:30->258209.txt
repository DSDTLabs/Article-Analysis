Pune: A group of parents who gathered at a prominent private school in Ambegaon (Budruk) to request the administration to withdraw the “massive”   were in for a shock to spot a police van on standby. 

 The parents were asked to come to the police station, as the education baron running the school claimed that he was “feeling threatened” by parents who wanted a discussion with him. 
 
 Worse even, the students whose parents were taking the lead in demanding withdrawal of the fee hike were asked to stand in a separate line.
 
 In another private school on Satara road, the administration has compelled the parents to buy dress material for their wards from a particular shop, besides imposing a sudden fee hike. When the parents sought an explanation, pat came the answer: “Take your kids out of the school if you have questions.”
 
 As private schools in the city are on a spree to impose a steep fee hike, nobody, including the education department and the civic education officers, is ready to take a stand on the issue. Some MLAs are gearing up to take up the matter in the Assembly.
 
 A teacher by profession and city MLA Medha Kulkarni said she would raise the matter in the coming monsoon session of the Assembly. 
 
 “ I will use the calling attention notice to draw the government’s attention. There are schools that have hiked fees after years. But some schools are increasing the fees as per their wish” she told TOI.
