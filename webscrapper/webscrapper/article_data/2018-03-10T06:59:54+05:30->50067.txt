MUMBAI: The   government has allocated Rs 13,385 crore for the police force. 

 A sum of Rs 8,000 crore is for paying salaries of police personnel and Rs 5,000 crore will go towards purchasing ammunition, police modernization initiative, administrative expenditure and police housing. The opposition slammed the government for showing an “inflated” allocation for the department. “During our time, even if I approved Rs 500 crore for projects to the home department, RR Patil (former home minister) would thank me profusely,” said former finance minister Jayant Patil. “The BJP government’s speciality is to show inflated allocations and not use the budgeted funds,” he added. 
 
 Fadnavis handles the home department and   has been on the radar of radical groups for long. Mumbai, the state’s capital and the nation’s economic powerhouse has borne the brunt of several terror attacks. The state has 2 lakh personnel for a population of nearly 12 crore. The economic survey tabled in the legislature on Thursday stated that crimes against women and children were on the rise in Maharashtra. The opposition has targeted Fadnavis over his handling of the police department. 
 
 “We have taken up projects of security and law and order seriously and have allocated a large sum for the home department,” said state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. 
 
 A new project called the ‘visitor entry management’ system as been proposed to be implement in all police stations.
