MUMBAI: In a significant recommendation to the state government, chief right to services (RTS) commissioner   on Thursday directed all state government departments and bodies to prepare a “master list” of all the services offered to the people and put the information on the   portal in three months.

 “The move will help ministers and secretaries understand the exact number of departments/bodies and their duties. Even today, no one in Mantralaya knows the exact number of government offices and services offered,” said an official.
 
 Kshatriya wants a timetable to be prepared by each department or a body indicating when all services offered will be available to the public under the Right to Services Act.
 
 The legislation fixes accountability and stipulates punishment in case the services demanded are not fulfilled. The recommendations have been issued after for mer central infor mation commissioner   objected to the administration’s “selective approach”. Out of the 438 services under the RTS ambit, citizens can avail only 399 through the online mode.
 
 The Right to Services Act was first introduced by   in 2013 as a private member’s bill. After he tabled it in the House,   was included in a team to formulate the guidelines. Later, Fadnavis became chief minister in 2014 and Kshatriya was elevated as chief secretary. The Right to Services Act was brought in as an ordinance and later cleared by the   in July 2015. Under the law, designated officers have a responsibility to ensure that services are made available within a stipulated timeframe. If they don’t meet expectations, then a complainant can file an appeal.
 
 Kshatriya said the RTS portal will have a digital locker for each citizen wherein the profile of applications and services offered to him/her will be listed. “The RTS charter listed online will have to serve in such a way that officials do not need to ask questions repeatedly each time a citizen makes an application,” he said.
