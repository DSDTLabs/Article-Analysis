AHMEDABAD: The   on Wednesday expressed its satisfaction at the   undertaken by AMC to  , but also said that the civic body has to actually work to the satisfaction of citizens and the status of the city.

 AMC placed a chart with details of damaged and repaired roads before the court. After perusal, the division bench said, “Considering the material on record, it appears that things have improved, but are still not up to the expectations, looking to the status of the city of Ahmedabad.”
 
 Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar was present at the hearing. The AMC submitted that 170 roads have been repaired since the monsoon and they include the 90 damaged roads. The court again sought details pertaining to the status of 1,947 roads constructed in the last three years which were allegedly damaged the most in the last monsoon.
 
 AMC submitted before court that all efforts are being made to improve the situation and sufficient work is being carried out.
 
 The petitioner’s counsel, Amit Panchal, pointed out that specific stretches of roads in the city where roads are yet to be repaired. He submitted that because of poor conditions of roads and pick-up stands at crossroads in the city, it is ultimately affecting traffic and the precious time of citizens is being wasted.
 
 The high court, however, castigated the civic authorities for not implementing town planning schemes even after they were sanctioned decades ago. People suffer due to non-implementation of the schemes. The court also asked the chief town planner to explain the status of TP schemes on February 23. The AMC promised the HC that there will be a joint meeting with town planning department and state government and the issue of town planning will be addressed, including with regard to newly included areas.
