PUNE: The   might have recorded impressive growth figures, but there seems to be no end to problems faced by airline passengers.

 Late on Sunday night, a   flight (9W982) from Kolkata landed before schedule at 11.25 pm. The passengers, however, had to wait inside the aircraft well past midnight before they could disembark. Rohit  , one of the passengers, tweeted: “Pune airport badly needs more gates and parking spot. It’s really irritates (sic) to land and then wait for 30-45min for a free gate to park the flight”
 
 
  
 
 “The flight had landed 5 minutes before schedule. However, the aircraft gates opened only at 12.05 am. It was very frustrating to just sit in the aircraft for 35 minutes. The airline staff kept saying that there was no parking space available and the ATC had requested us to wait,” Srivastwa said.
 
 Despite repeated emails requesting a comment, Jet Airways did not respond.
 
 About a fortnight ago, an IndiGo flight from Kolkata was 40 minutes late. The passengers onboard were made to wait an additional 30 minutes before they could deboard. The same evening, an   flight did not open doors for at least 40 minutes.
 
 “While we know that completion of such projects takes time, how can the AAI authorities boast of growth figures when there are these very basic problems? When will the authorities announce an increase in the number of parking bays and aerobridges?” asked  , a frequent flyer.
