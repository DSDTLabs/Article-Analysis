PANAJI: Banking services were hit across the state for the second day on Thursday, as public sector banks and a handful of private sector banks downed their shutters in protest of the 2% wage hike offered by the Indian Banks Association (IBA). The strike, which came towards the end of the month, affected cash withdrawals, salary deposits and cheque clearances along with other financial transactions involving fixed deposits and foreign exchange.

 While the strike did not affect ATM operations, it did inconvenience several customers seeking other services. SBI, Canara Bank,   of Maharashtra, UCO Bank and several other state-run lenders were closed for operations across the state with some ATMs in rural areas also running out of cash, officials said. 
 
 “There are so many other ways to express grievances. Inconveniencing people is not the way,” Satyavan Naik said after showing up at a major public sector bank in the city.
 
 Like Naik, several customers said a complete shutdown in banking operations in order to get a higher increase in wages appeared unjustified as the quality of service from bank employees was far from satisfactory.
 
 “They should not get paid for these two days. Even when we go to banks to seek basic facilities, we are harassed,” Ashutosh Kenkre, a pensioner, said. “It’s time to suspend all the people involved in this strike and ban such unions.”
 
 The strike was called by the United Forum of Banking Unions (UFBU).
