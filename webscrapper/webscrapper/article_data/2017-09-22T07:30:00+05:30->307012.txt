Panchkula: A 40-year-old man was allegedly beaten to death by his ex-wife, her boss and father over a pity issue in Sector 19 on Thursday morning.

 Cops said the mother of the victim, Pushpa Devi, who had been living alone with Tiwari in their house, raised an alarm and called up the local residents, who rushed Tiwari to some private hospital where Tiwari succumbed to his injuries on Thursday morning. The body was shifted to the general hospital, Sector 6 where he was declared brought dead at around 10 am. The hospital authorities informed the cops about the incident.
