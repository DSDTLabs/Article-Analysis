VADODARA: A person having a business of opticals was booked for cheating at Harni police station on Wednesday.

 
 Accused   had borrowed Rs50 lakh from his friend   between 2011 and 2015. When he was not able to return the money, he decided to give a property which he had bought to Khatri. But recently when Khatriâ€™s widow Priyanka went to take possession of the property, she learnt from the builder that   had not paid the entire amount of the property.
 
 Khatri, who was in the trading of incense stick at Khatri Pol near  , had lent Rs41 lakh to Jaiswal between May 2011 and November 2012. In February 2014, when Jaiswal asked for more money from Khatri, he refused to lend since the accused had not returned the money which he had borrowed earlier. Jaiswal then proposed that if Khatri gives him another Rs9 lakh, he will give him a property on Harni Road. Jaiswal told his friend that he had signed the sale deed for the property in 2014.
 
 In March 2015, Jaiswal and Khatri signed the sale deed for the property. After Khatri passed away in May 2016, Priyanka went to the builder to take possession of the property. But she learnt that the builder has not signed the sale deed with Jaiswal since he had not paid the entire amount. Later, Priyanka also came to know that Jaiswal has done a deal with some other person too for the same property.
 
 Police said Priyanka made repeated demands to Jaiswal to return the money or give possession, but when he did not budge, she filed a complaint against him.
