Nagpur: Swatantryaveer   was a staunch nationalist whose sacrifices for freeing India from the clutches of Britishers are unparalleled in history while his writings and speeches inspired countless number of people to participate in freedom struggle, said Sacchidanand Shewde, a well-known literary figure and orator, on Thursday.

 The literature of great son of the soil reflected true picture of the society which was reeling under oppressive British regime and showed freedom fighters a ray of hope that the colonial rule can be defeated, said Shewde, while delivering a lecture on ‘Swatantryaveer Savarkar: Ek jhanjawat’, organized as part of Khasdar Sanskrutik Mahotsav at Ishwar Deshmukh College, Krida Chowk.
 
 Savarkar’s literature knew no boundaries as he fought for freedom of the country and tried to knit the society in a common thread, the virtue every youth today should take lessons from, Shewde said. His poem ‘Jayostu te shri mahanmangale shivaspade shubhde..’ continues to be as popular today as during his days which showed his love for the motherland, he said. 
 
 Shewde said, “The youths should understand that freedom was not served on a platter but was the result of blood, sweat and toil of champions of independence. People should believe in God, nation and dharma to create a better society.” 
 
 Throwing light on the life of Savarkar, he said that he drew inspiration from the sacrifice of Chafekar brothers. He founded Abhinav Bharat at Bhagur, near Nashik, whose volunteers vowed not to stop their fight till independence was achieved. He subsequently dissolved the body in 1954.
 
 Recalling the love Savarkar had for the motherland, Shewde said he decided to burn imported clothes to ignite the spirit of nationalist and the event evoked spontaneous response from the people.
 
 Present at the lecture were mayor Nanda Jichkar, former MP Datta Meghe and Kanchan Gadkari.
