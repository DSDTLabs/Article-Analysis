CUTTACK: The matriculation   results will be published in the second week of May. 

  
  
 
 Sources in the   said the exact date of publication of results would be declared in a day or two.
 
 This time, the publication of result has been delayed by almost a week. In 2017, the results were published on April 26. In 2016, they were published on April 27.
 
 "Earlier, our results would be published before that of CBSE or other boards. We would get ample time to decide on our plans," said Saurav Das, a student.
 
 The   authorities said the delay this time was caused by the Odisha State Open School (SOS) exam being held simultaneously with the regular matric exam.
 
 The matric exam for dropout students is conducted under the SOS system. The facility was introduced in 2016 to provide an opportunity to weaker students to pass the matric exam through the distance mode.
 
 "Our intention behind conducting the two exams simultaneously was to save money and resources. But it seems the decision was not a good one. As both the exams are completely different, we faced a lot of difficulty in evaluation and preparation of results," said a senior board official.
 
 "More than 40,000 students appeared for the matric exam under the SOS system. This has increased our workload. From next year, we will conduct the SOS exam separately," said the official.
 
 Board president Jahan Ara Begum said measures had been taken to ensure error-free results.
