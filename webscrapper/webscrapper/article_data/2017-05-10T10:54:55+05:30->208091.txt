CUTTACK: It's as if   relish keeping their supporters on their toes. After their thrilling come-from-behind 3-2 victory in their   opener here, the Mizoram club scripted another thrilling win in the second to book the first semifinal berth here on Tuesday.

 Khalid Jamil had kissed the ground, raised his hands and said a prayer after his boys scored the first goal against   in the 21st minute. That it came from a penalty and was a bit against the run of play was not a matter of concern. It was a just a sigh of relief for the Aizawl FC coach whose side had to struggle for the win against Chennai City. Although that goal was the highlight of the first half and most of the second half, little did he know that his wards were about to go through a nervous last few minutes as Churchill came back into the match, also through a penalty, in the 84th minute. But like true champions, Indian football's 'people's club' sealed the tie in style with a diagonal cross to the tournament's top-scorer, Laldanmawia Ralte, who put the ball in, beating the Churchill goalie in the 90th minute.
 
 The final whistle signalled heartbreak for the Derrick Pereira-coached side but it made Aizawl FC the first team to seal their place in the semifinal. Their six points put them on top of Group A, with   on four and Churchill Brothers on one point. Chennai City have not scored a point so far. Although Churchill -for whom this meeting was a must-win -began with gusto, they were unable to find a breakthrough.
 
 Ansumana Kromah and Brandon Fernandes were fed with balls by Meriton Fernandes and   from the middle and the wings but the goal eluded Pereira's wards.
 
 Meanwhile,   struck twice to help East Bengal defeat   2-0 to register their first win. Chennai City FC slumped to their second defeat of the tournament and find themselves at the bottom of the table.
