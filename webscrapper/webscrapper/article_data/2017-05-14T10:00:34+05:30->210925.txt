VISAKHAPATNAM: The city police formed around five teams on Saturday to investigate the fraud case in which income tax officials on Friday lodged complaints against nine people for floating fake companies and carrying out international transactions worth over Rs 500 crore. 

 Sources said the cops have already arrested kingpin Vaddi Maheshâ€™s father   from   in Srikakulam. The sources also said Vaddi Mahesh was arrested in Kolkata, but the police are yet to confirm this. They suspect the involvement of a few politicians and businessmen, especially from north Andhra Pradesh, Kolkata and Odisha in the fraud and are investigating that angle.
