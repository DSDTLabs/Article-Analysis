HYDERABAD: A 29-year-old woman from the city who was allegedly made to beg for food at wedding functions in   by her kafil(employer) has been rescued by the Indian Embassy in Saudi Arabia. MBT leader Amjedullah Khan also wrote to Union external affairs minister   about Samina being pushed into slavery after being trafficked from India.

 A resident of Talab Katta, Samina was trafficked to Saudi Arabia by a local travel agent, who sent another man with her labelling them as husband and wife. She realised that she had been tricked only after reaching Saudi Arabia. Since the employer had asked for two people to be sent to work for him, and had specified that they be a married couple, Samina and the man Mohd Abdul   were sent in July 2016 While Nayeem returned to the city following a heart attack due to work pressure there, Samina was tortured and made to work in four houses. As her situation worsened and the kaifl denied medical help, Samina contacted her family in Hyderabad.
 
 Amjed   said a case was registered against the agent at Bhavaninagar police station following a complaint lodged by Saminaâ€™s family.
 
 The kafil, Al Qasim, refused to send her back to India, demanding that she pay Rs 3 lakh to be released.
 
 Samina could return to the city only after her plight came to the notice of Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and the Protector General of Emigrants (PGE) M C Luther.
 
 Indian Embassy officials in Riyadh counselled the employer and saw to it that she was sent back to India.
