We had told you earlier that ad-filmmaker-turned-director   has roped in   for his yet-to-be-titled film that is to be produced by   and  . Senna has been looking for his leading lady for a while now, and has found her in  , who is known for her roles in Tamil films like Iravi, KuttrameThandani and Aandavan Kattalai. Pooja — who was born and partly raised in Bengaluru before shifting base to Chennai (her mother is a Kannadiga) — had expressed a desire to Rakshit around two years ago to act in offbeat Kannada movies — the kind that he is known to make and star in. And Pooja couldn’t be happier with the opportunity that she has got with Senna’s film, not just because of the “beautiful script”, but also because it is being made by Pushkara and Rakshit’s banner.

 “Offbeat doesn’t always mean not commercial. I look at the depth and development of the character, and, in this film, my character has a lot of drama around her. So, there is a lot of scope for an actor and I feel like I have a lot to work towards in the movie. Rakshit thought about me when Senna was looking for his leading lady and asked me to come down for a look test. I auditioned, mainly for them to gauge my Kannada, and that was it. My mother is a Kannadiga, so my Kannada is good. I am excited and look forward to begin shooting for the film, which should begin in a month or so,” she says.
 
 
 
 "We took a long time to finalize the actress, since it is an extremely important role. Her character is introduced a little late in the film, but the moment she walks in, she shifts the mood of the film. There is a lot of fluctuation caused due to her presence, especially emotionally. We chose Pooja because she really stood out in terms of what is required for this character," says Senna.
