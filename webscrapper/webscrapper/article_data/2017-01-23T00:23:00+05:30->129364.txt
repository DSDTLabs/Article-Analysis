Mhow: There was panic on the outskirts of Mhow on Saturday after a wild animal, possibly a leopard, killed a 65-year-old woman near  .

 The mangled body, with parts of the face ripped off, was found in a dense jungle about 10km from Mhow town.
 
 The victim, Nathi Bai, was a resident of Nandlai village on Mhow-Manpur Road and had gone to the jungle to collect firewood on Friday afternoon, said police. She was returning home when she was attacked. There were grievous wounds on her neck, jaw and left arm. She bled to death, say police.
 
 Her family went looking for him in the late evening hours. Her husband, 71-year-old Shyam Bheel, said that she was dead when they found her. “Looking at her injuries, it could only be a leopard because hyenas generally don't attack human beings. There are no other carnivores in these jungles,” he said.
 
 Bargonda police station in-charge   said they have asked forest officials to identify and track down the animal so that people can be informed. Also, it is necessary to complete the compensation formalities.
 
 Foresters are yet to confirm that it was a leopard but the spotted cats have attacked people at least four times in the area between Nandlai Ghati and Manpur. In the last such incident, about two years ago, a leopard mauled a woman working in her field near   village. Her husband who was working nearby ran to help her and attacked it with a sickle. Man and animal fought for several minutes. Other villagers started shouting and beating drums, finally scaring away the leopard. Such incidents have occurred in Malendi, Mangliya and a few other villages.
