PANAJI:   (MGP) on Thursday expressed shock over the exit polls conducted by various agencies as most of them have not mentioned the party. Speaking to TOI, the   chief ministerial candidate Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’   said that the exit polls are meaningless as they have not shown any seat for the MGP and showed four seats for   (AAP). “Most of the exit polls do not know that MGP exists in the state,” said Dhavalikar adding that exit polls are not correct as they have not collected proper information. MGP president   ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar also said all exit polls are bogus and it is a show of advertisement against the national party. “They don’t have any idea about regional parties in Goa. Before making such exit polls for Goa, they should study the total political scenario of the state,” he said. “MGP will win at least nine seats in assembly elections,” Deepak added.
