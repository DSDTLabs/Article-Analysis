AHMEDABAD: Even as the city gets its first real-time   on Friday, it will be deprived of a comprehensive plan for controlling air pollution in the city. For more than four months, now the   (AAP) for Ahmedabad city has been gathering dust with officials of the district administration, municipal corporation,   and other allied departments which are reluctant to launch the plan for the city. 

 While the AQMS installed by   (IITM) “Safar-Air” will be operational, providing real-time pollution updates and forecasting through mobile apps, there will be no concrete action on ground.
 
 The major aim of the   plan is to curtail emission of pollutants from activities like transport, construction, open burning of waste and from industries surrounding the city. Measures like a ban on open burning of waste, capping of the Pirana dump and putting out the ever-smouldering fire, helping replace all municipal diesel buses with CNG buses and increasing the frequency of buses, replacing diesel commercial three wheelers with CNG ones, proper auditing of PUC centres and recalibrating PUC values to new standards and financial assistance to encourage use of clean fuels are included in the plan.
