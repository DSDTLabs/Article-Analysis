KOLHAPUR: A face-off between   and workers' union of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is likely on the cards over biometric attendance.

 The civic administration has issued show-cause notices to 60 employees, including departmental officers, for failing to register daily attendance through the newly-installed  .
 
 The civic administration has found that some of the employees have not registered their attendance through biometric system and many have attendance only once a day. Every KMC employee has been asked to register their attendance twice every day and only those employees with prior permission of their respective departmental heads gets concession.
 
 Last week, during general body meeting, the corporators had claimed the biometric system is faulty and demanded manual attendance system. However, the civic administration made it clear that both systems will be in place and the biometric system is not faulty.
 
 A senior KMC official, requesting anonymity, said, “We have found that many officers do not come back to office after they leave for lunch. The citizens face inconvenience after they find the officer is not in office. Several such complaints have been made to senior officials. The 60 employees have to face salary cuts for the number of days for which discrepancies observed during attendance. The biometric system is not faulty as we have taken several trials before it actually started registering attendance.”
 
 Junior engineers, health inspectors and officers of the garden department are among those received notices. The workers unions are opposing the biometric system since it was installed a year ago at all the  .
 
 “Henceforth, the salaries of the employees will be automatically cut if the attendance is not recorded. The KMC is facing staff crunch to address concerns of the citizens and the higher authorities have to face ire from both citizens and elected representatives if the grievance is not heeded on time,” said the official.
