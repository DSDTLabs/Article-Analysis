HYDERABAD: After watching their children writhe in pain through the night or faint after  , desperate parents of 12 children protested against officials of the   on Sunday. 

 Bhaskar, whose daughter Amrutha was admitted in the hospital after suffering from cold, said, “We brought our daughter to this hospital since we did not have the money to afford treatment in a private hospital. But it was scary to see what happened to our children. Shortly after being given the antibiotic, my daughter began vomiting, which was followed by a bout of seizure.“
 
  
  
 
 For Sandhya, whose six-year-old daughter   was admitted with pneumonia, the last thing she could think of was a botch-up.“When we asked them to give us an explanation as to what was happening with our children, the officials pushed the blame on us saying we brought the spurious drugs from outside. Why would we buy the injection from outside, when the hospital has a pharmacy of its own?“ she asked.
 
 “The nurses were accusing us that the injections that were given to our children were procured from outside. Why would we do that?
 We think that the nurses did not check the drugs that were administered to the children.They just gave it to them off hand, in a bid to brush off their responsibilities,“ said Bhaskar.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Michael, a resident of Bowenpally, whose grandson Zohail was admitted in the hospital a week ago, said the doctors told him that the `side-effects' the children were showing were not a result of the medicine. “We could understand if one child reacted to the medicine, but if 10 or 12 children suffer from the same symptoms there must be something wrong with the medicine provided,“ said Michael.
 
 Making matters worse, the parents alleged that while the children began reacting to the drug, by 8pm last night, they were only sent to the intensive care unit after midnight on Saturday.
