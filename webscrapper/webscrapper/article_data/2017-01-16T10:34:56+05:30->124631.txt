KHARAGPUR:   (45), brother of Choto Angariya massacre survivor Abdul Bakhtar, was   in West Midnapore’s once-political hotspot — Chamkaitala in Garbeta — in the wee hours of Sunday. The murder looks similar to the January 4, 2001 incident, in which Bakhtar’s house was pelted with bullets and bombs killing 11 people. 

 Bakhtar’s brother was burnt in a locked cold storage. A huge police team led by a senior officer was sent from Midnapore headquarters to Garbeta.
 
 Mondal, who had been working as a night guard at the cold storage unit since 1996, went to work as usual on Saturday. He checked the locks and then retired to a makeshift room for guards. A little past midnight, some miscreants entered the godown and locked the labourers in the quarters nearby. They then locked Mondal in the guardroom, doused its walls with kerosene and set it on fire. “To ensure no one stepped out, the miscreants hurled bombs,” said cold storage owner Anup Parihar. The guardroom remained ablaze till 4am. By the time cops pulled out Mondal, his body was charred.
 
 Abu Hosen, one of Mondal’s three brothers, lodged an FIR blaming Trinamool’s booth committee member Mongeshwar Mullick. “Osman and Mongeshwar had an altercation over distribution of wages under the 100 days work scheme,” he alleged. Garbeta’s Trinamool MLA Ashish Chakraborty said: “Mullick is a history-sheeter with no links to the party.” 
 
 SP Bharati Ghosh said the miscreants made a hole in the asbestos roof and poured kerosene through it before setting the room afire.
