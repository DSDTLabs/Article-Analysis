 Initially, January 31 was last date to submit   for the proposed hawking pitches, but as the BMC got very poor response—over 1,300—it extended the deadline. According to the BMC survey till 2014, there are 99,435 eligible hawkers in Mumbai. The BMC proposed to settle them on 85,891 hawking pitches identified across the city.
