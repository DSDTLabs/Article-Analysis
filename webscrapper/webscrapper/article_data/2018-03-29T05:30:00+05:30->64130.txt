Mysuru: A day after the dates for the assembly elections were announced, the district administration wasted no time in bringing down   that were put up in public spaces, and on vehicles cross the city.

 With the ‘Model Code of Conduct’ coming into force, teams attached to the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) could be seen clearing billboards, hoardings and other publicity material. The district administration has set a two-day deadline for clearing the advertisements. On Wednesday, nearly 75% of the material were removed.
 
 While many billboards, and flexes have been brought down, TOI found that advertisements on a few Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses had not been removed. However, advertisements being displayed on LCD/ LED screens at bus stands had been stopped by the authorities.
 
 Many autorickshaws plying on the city’s streets too were seen sporting government advertisements. When they were asked why they had not removed the advertisements, they admitted to being unaware of the code of conduct coming into effect. “Officials have not asked to remove them yet,” they said.
 
 On the other hand, there are more than five hoardings of the central government with the picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Mysuru City Railway Station. Also, details of beneficiaries of various yojana schemes are also displayed on these hoardings. Moreover, some of the central government hoardings have also been put up at fuel stations, which the authorities appear not to be too keen on removing.
 
 MCC nodal officer Renukamba told TOI, “I have directed all workers to remove publicity material of both the state and central governments in the city by Thursday. While around 75% of the material has been removed, the rest will be cleared at the earliest. The photograph of former PM Indira Gandhi at all Indira Canteens will be covered.”
