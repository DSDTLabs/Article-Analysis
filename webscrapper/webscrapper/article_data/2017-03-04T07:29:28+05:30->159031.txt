BENGALURU: The   dubbing controversy saw a sequel on Friday when the screening of the dubbed version of Tamil film ‘Yennai Arindhaal’, with the title ‘Sathyadev IPS’ in Kannada, was stopped by  .

 Theatres refused to screen it due to opposition from Kannada activists and actors. The dubbed version of the 2015 Tamil film was produced by Krishnegowda and was scheduled for release in 23 theatres across the state.
 
 “Allowing   would open the gates of Sandalwood to other language producers who would dump their movies here. If this happens there will be nothing Kannada in Sandalwood,” said an activist.
 
 While Kannada actor Jaggesh had threatened to set fire to theatres that screen the dubbed movie, Kannada activist Vatal Nagaraj has called for a demonstration on March 9 in Bengaluru against dubbed movies.
 
 The dubbing debate intensified in February when the Central Board for Film Certification gave a UA certificate to ‘Sathyadev IPS’. Those favouring dubbing said Kannadigas should be allowed access quality entertainment from other languages by breaking the nearly 40-year unwritten rule that banned dubbing. “Kannadigas are forced to watch remakes of films. Instead, it will be more prudent to allow them to directly access dubbed content. Moreover, dubbing industry will provide employment to dubbing artistes and technicians in the state,” the dubbing movie lobby said.
 
 Actor Jaggesh said: “The dubbing lobby is testing the waters by trying to release the Tamil film (Sathyadev IPS). There are some politicians and movie industry bigwigs behind this move. This lobby has suggested that media channels not buy films with Kannada actors and instead wait for the hurdles to be cleared for these dubbed movies. While the rights of an original Kannada film (of big stars) would cost Rs 1 crore upwards the dubbed movies will be supplied for Rs 30-40 lakh to the channels.”
 
 Actors Shivaraj Kumar, Darshan, Rangayana Rahu and Sadhu Kokila have also opposed dubbed movies.
