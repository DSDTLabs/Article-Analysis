SHIMLA: Former Union minister and deputy leader of   in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma on Friday sought an apology from Prime Minister   Modi-led NDA government "for making false promises and cheating people during its four-year rule". 

 Questioning the decisions like demonetization and GST, Sharma said after Independence, the   government has brought the maximum pain to the country and its people.
 
 Interacting with media persons in Shimla, he said the Pakistan policy of the Modi government has been a disaster and the Prime Minister owes an explanation about his decision to land in Lahore on December 25, 2016. He said it was an insult to the entire nation and he landed there without a guard of honour. He also accused Modi of distorting history just to mislead public during election time.
 
 He said the Modi government had claimed that demonetization was done to end corruption, black money and to check terror funding, but the results were just the opposite. 
 
 He said the Modi government had promised to give two crore jobs every year, but the reality is that people have lost jobs after demonetization. He said hasty implementation of GST was another wrong step taken by the government and since last year it has been amended 40 times.
 
 He said instead of celebrating four years of rule with massive propaganda and by spending crores of rupees to misguide people, Modi government should tender an apology to the nation on this day. He claimed that investment rate in country has touched a historic low in the past six decades.
