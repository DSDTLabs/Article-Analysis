Coimbatore: Speaking at the centennial celebration of a corporation elementary school at Kalapatti in the city on Friday, school education minister KA Sengottaiyan expressed hope that at least 1,500 students from government schools would get into medical colleges this year. “Unlike the previous years, when students had to approach private institutions to prepare for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), this year, the state government has been giving free training to them. The government also provided free laptops and accommodation to 3,118 students from nine colleges across Tamil Nadu to prepare them for the competitive examination,” he said. The students are confident of getting into medical colleges, thanks to the teaching technique adopted during the residential training, the minister said. “The state government has been working to upgrade the school syllabus to be on par with the NCERT syllabus. Gradually, the syllabus for all classes will be revised. We plan to complete upgrading the syllabus within two years. Once the upgradation is complete, experts from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will train the teachers to improve their teaching skills. Students’ uniform would also be changed,” Sengottaiyan said.
