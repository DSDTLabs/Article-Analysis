PANAJI: The   (CBI) on Tuesday registered an FIR against staffer of the State Bank of India, Bambolim branch, for   worth Rs 13 lakh between November 10 and 19. 

 The CBI booked Maya Dalvi under various sections of Prevention of Corruption Act and Indian Penal Code. Dalvi has been placed under suspension since November end.
 
 A CBI official confirmed to TOI that they have registered an offence against Dalvi, but refused to divulge the status of the progress made in the investigation.
 
 The case has been registered under Sections 13 (1) (c ), 13 (1) (d) read with Section 13 (2) of Prevention of corruption Act and Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) against Maya Dalvi.
 
 Though the exchange of notes had happened immediately after the   of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November 2016, there was a delay in registering the case. 
 
 Besides Maya Dalvi, one more official of the bank has been placed under suspension for a similar offence.
 
 A source said that the decision to suspend the two officials was taken in Mumbai as the local management was not in favour of taking a decision. An internal inquiry, suspension orders and decision to go for a CBI investigation was also made at the bankâ€™s headquarters, a source said.
