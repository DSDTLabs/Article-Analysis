HYDERABAD: At a time when the government is trying to project Hyderabad as a cosmopolitan city with great roads and streamlined traffic, authorities admit that unless lane driving rules are enforced, traffic conditions in the city will only worsen.

 With traffic moving at snail’s pace in many areas, traffic experts say lane management can improve the situation.
 
 “Infrastructure should be developed in such a way that wherever multi lanes are available junctions should be widened, otherwise they will result in bottle necks,” said Dheerendra
 
 Samineni, a road safety trainer from the city.
 
 
  
 
 Also authorities should enforce the rule only after educating commuters.
 
 Traffic cops say poor infrastructure, such as narrow roads and pothole ridden roads, across the city force commuters to skip lane driving.
 
 “Penalising people flouting lane rules is possible only if the city has at least four km of continuous multi-lane roads. We don’t have the mechanism to keep a tab on vehicles changing the lanes,” said Narsing Rao, inspector (traffic), Hyderabad. Similar opinion was expressed by   deputy commissioner of police (Traffic-II).
 
 “Today even if the road is wide or has three lanes, the road gets congested within a km or two,” one officer said.
