KOLKATA: The   and land revenue department has decided to adopt a satellite-based measurement tool that has an accuracy of up to 10 cm. A pilot project is already underway in Nadia’s  .

 The current system of measurement is rather antiquated involving research, mapping, evaluation and documentation that is time-consuming and prone to error and disputes. 
 
 With CM   keen to expedite the process and develop a detailed documentation of the land bank for investors, the L&LR department has decided to embrace a technology called DGPS or differential global positioning satellite. DGPS uses a network of fixed ground-based reference stations to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the   satellite systems and the known fixed positions to arrive at a more accurate positioning of the land.
 
 “Adopting DGPS will also solve the challenge of preserving documents that are currently bulky and take up a lot of space. Once we shift to DGPS, storage issue will be solved as it will be entirely digital,” an official said. 
 
 The department proposes to use DGPS for land survey to identify vested land and map it with great accuracy. This will also come in handy in mapping plots in remote or inaccessible areas like the Sunderbans.
 
 The pilot project that is underway in Haringhata is expected to be completed in six months. Once its results are ratified, DGPS will be introduced all over the state. At pres-ent, there are 3.67 lakh personal properties in 42,024 moujas across the state.
 
 “Beyond what is mapped lies a vast amount of unmapped land. Through DGPS, we can make a detailed map and identify land for industry,” an official said, adding that it will also usher in transparency.
