DEHRADUN:   has installed 15   in the city but it has failed to curb   in the open. Residents said that the nigam has conducted no awareness drives about the dustbins so people are continuing to throw trash in vacant plots. The nigam plans to install 80 underground bins across 32 locations in the city.
 
  Meeta Vohra, a resident of Nehru Colony, said, “Although it is a great initiative by the nigam the residents are not aware of it. When door-to-door garbage collection is not regular they throw trash in vacant plots or on the side of the road. The nigam should make the locals aware about the placement of these dustbins and the benefit of using them.”
  
  The nigam officials, however, said that the areas where dustbins are operational have turned cleaner.
  
  “In the areas where the bins have been installed there is no garbage on the roads and the streets are already looking cleaner. One doesn’t even see stray animals spreading the garbage,” said  
  
  Gunjyal also said that the company supplying the underground bins have been asked to redesign the ones that would be installed in the second phase to make them more user-friendly.
