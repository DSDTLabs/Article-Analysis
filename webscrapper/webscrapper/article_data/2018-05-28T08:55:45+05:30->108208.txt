HYDERABAD: Uppuguda corporator  , also a GHMC standing committee member, was attacked by a mob when he tried to rescue cross-dressers being thrashed after being mistaken for a kidnap gang. 

 
 A 52-year-old cross-dresser died after being beaten up by a mob of around 1,500 near Defence Electronics Research Laboratory (DLRL) which falls under   station limits. By the time the corporator reached the spot, violence had escalated and stones were being used to hit the victims.
 
 When the corporator tried to rescue them, the mob attacked him, injuring his shoulder and knee. He was admitted to hospital on Saturday and was discharged on Sunday. 
 
 The mob also punched circle inspector of Chandrayangutta, broke the glass of patrolling vehicles and pelted stones on Chandrayangutta Police station. "The violence was barbaric and for a moment I felt there no humanity left after seeing the mob thrashing the cross-dressers. The incident was pre-planned as many of the attackers were not locals. Suddenly, around 400 people joined the existing mob," said Fahad.
 
 Fahad received a call from locals saying that a transgender who came to the city to kidnap children had been caught and people were thrashing him, however the corporator who was aware about the rumors rushed to the spot to save them.
