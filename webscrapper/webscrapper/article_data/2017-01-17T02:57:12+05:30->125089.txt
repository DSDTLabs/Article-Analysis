LUCKNOW: Minutes after the EC recognised him as the national president of the   and allotted him the party symbol,   on Monday went to meet his father   at his residence to seek his blessings.

 He tweeted, "Cycle Chalti Jayegi... Aage Bardti Jayegi", along with photographs of his meeting with Mulayam and shots of the January 1 party convention, where Akhilesh was elected as the SP president.
 
 Akhilesh’s meeting with Mulayam came in the backdrop of the SP patriarch’s allegations that his son didn’t listen to him.
 
 Earlier in the day, Mulayam told party workers that Akhilesh was not pro-Muslim. Mulayam, during his address to his supporters at the party headquarters, was asked by agitating cadres to save the party. Mulayam replied, "What has happened to you? Why are you behaving in this manner? If EC doesn’t give us our symbol, then let’s see."
 
 Mulayam said he was determined to stop his party from splitting and would move court if the EC decision went against him.
 
 "What can I do when my son has turned against me by playing into the hands of Ram Gopal Yadav," he asked, adding that he had called him thrice since morning to talk but to no avail. "He came for five minutes and went away even before I could start the discussion," Mulayam said.
 
 Recalling how he took a strong stand to save the Babri mosque from demolition, Mulayam said there was growing perception that Akhilesh was not pro-Muslim. He was given the title "Mullah Mulayam" by the BJP after the police firing on ‘karsevaks’ in Ayodhya to protect the mosque.
 
 "I’ve always advocated the interest of Muslims. When I ensured appointment of a Muslim as the DGP, Akhilesh did not talk to me for 15 days. It sent out a message that he was anti-Muslim," he alleged.
