MUMBAI: Tenants of a former art gallery in   have accused the landlord of blocking the footpath outside their property by placing steel columns and bamboos. They alleged that   had failed to act on their complaints. 

  Gulistan Irani and Morvarid Tafty, who occupy the ground floor of   on Murzban Road in Fort, were running the gallery for around six years since 2004. Occasionally, the space would be given out for book exhibitions.
 
  They said that since 2010, the landlord blocked the area outside. "All we need is the footpath to be free of encroachments so that we can at least use our property or give it out for exhibitions. In the present condition, who would want to come to an art gallery whose footpath is in such a bad shape?" said Tafty.
 
  One of the landlords, Anand Sheth, said BMC had told them to prop up the weak balcony. "We therefore went ahead and did it. The entry to their property has not been blocked," he said.
 
  Assistant municipal commissioner   told TOI the building had been given a 353(B) notice under   Act, 1888, which makes structural audits compulsory for private buildings that are 30 years or older. 
 
  "Footpath occupancy charges will be recovered from the landlord," he said.
