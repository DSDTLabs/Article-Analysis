NEW DELHI: The entrance exam for  's Hindi MPhil course has been released. Of the 800 candidates who appeared for the 12 available seats in the department, only four managed to cross the 50%   which, as per   regulations, is now mandatory for MPhil admissions. 

 This led many to blame the regulations and claim that removal of the previous JNU regulations — which gave deprivation points and other benefits to SC/ST, OBC and PWD candidates —was the reason for the abysmal result.
 
 A member of the JNU administration confirmed the result, but refused to comment on the reason.
 
 The entrance test for MPhil Hindi was the first such in two years, since the 2016 UGC regulations on MPhil/ PhD was put into place.
 
 “There is no confirmation that even the four candidates who have qualified will finally be admitted for they have to sit and clear an interview which has 100% marks,” said a professor of the Hindi department. The professor, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed that the 2016 regulations — which states that 50% qualifying mark is compulsory — is the reason for the poor result. “This is the reason why students were protesting throughout last year. If only the earlier regulations were followed we would not have seen this situation,” the professor added.
 
 Chairman of the Hindi department Gobind Prasad informed that earlier the university would provide several benefits to students. “Those from the OBC category only had to get 20% from the written exam to qualify, while SC/ ST and PWD candidates needed only 18%. Also, earlier the students had to write a 70 marks paper and 30 marks would come from the interview. The system was changed in the UGC regulations, which prescribed 100 marks for interview as well,” Prasad said. He said the university would also give deprivation points to students who came from remote areas of the country; which has now been removed.
 
 Meanwhile, many students think the reason for poor results could also be poor evaluation.
