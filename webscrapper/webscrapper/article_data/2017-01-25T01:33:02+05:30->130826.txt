THANE: Two employees of a private telecom firm were among the seven men arrested after the   busted a Bhiwandi-based cartel that allegedly issued SIM cards by fabricating government documents.

 A tip-off to senior inspector Shital Raut about SIMs being sold at a premium rate without any valid documents bared the nexus between activation managers of the telecom company, the authorized distributor and others who made fake Aadhaar cards and voter ID cards, among other documents. 
 
 On Monday, the police raided the shop, Ashrafi Mobiles, and seized 11,345 activated SIM cards of different telecom companies, 110 handsets used for activation of the SIM cards, 60 rubber stamps of private telecom firms, two computers, scanners and printers.“Shop owner Siraj Ansari and his accomplice Dyanprakash were arrested and booked for cheating and forgery. They led us to Altam Ansari, who resides in Gulzar Nagar,” said joint police commissioner Ashutosh Dumbre on Tuesday. Intense interrogation also led to the arrest of Sandeep Gupta, Anil Singh, Bandu Bhakre and Ganesh Nelawade—the latter two are activation managers at the telecom firm. 
 
 Three others who are involved in the racket, including a distributor of the SIM cards, are absconding, the police said.
 
 The police claimed that Siraj and Altam would prepare fake Aadhaar or voter ID cards using photographs of people selected randomly from social networking websites and fake addresses. Customers who wanted a SIM card but had no valid documents would be provided one for over Rs 1,000. The activated SIMs would be available in roadside stalls and paan shops. In the last seven months, Siraj had sold 470 SIM cards without any valid documents.
 
 The police found 49,967 photographs, 9,400 fake Aadhar cards, 3,702 fake voter ID cards, 1,990 blank forms for SIM cards and 1,987 company forms of fabricated customers for obtaining SIM cards of different companies, Raut informed TOI.
