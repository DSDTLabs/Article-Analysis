GURUGRAM: Taking cognisance of a plea filed by several retired defence officers from Gurgaon alleging encroachment of a   by Ambience, which they allege is leading to traffic jams and accidents on NH-8, the Punjab and Haryana   on Thursday issued   seeking replies from   Hotels and Resorts Limited and the Haryana government.

 A division bench headed by Justice Surya Kant passed the orders while hearing a petition filed by Col (retd) Subhash Chandra Talwar, Lt-Gen (retd) AK Puri and several other residents of Ambience Lagoon. The petitioners sought directions to get all encroachments removed from the 50-metre green belt between the service road of NH-8 and Ambience Mall.
 
 Further directions to provide smooth ingress and egress for residents of Ambience Lagoon was also sought by the petitioners, who said most of them were senior citizens and high-ranking defence veterans who had to commute every day between Delhi and Gurgaon. Ambience Lagoon is located behind the mall.
 
 The counsel for the petitioners, Pradeep Rapria, argued that Ambience had illegally occupied that green belt and no action had been taken by the state government. This has led to clogging of traffic on one hand and denial of entry to Ambience Lagoon for the petitioners on the other hand. It was further alleged that the mall authorities had encroached on 50 metres of the service and sector roads, turning it into a perpetual bottleneck.
 
 “The encroachment has not only affected the petitioners but also lakhs of commuters who go from Delhi to Gurgaon through that service road,” Rapria argued before the bench. The case will come up for hearing next on April 3.
 
 Ambience officials could not be contacted for a comment despite repeated attempts.
