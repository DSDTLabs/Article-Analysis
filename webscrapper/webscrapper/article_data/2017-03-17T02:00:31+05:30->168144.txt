PATNA: After UP, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, now Chhattisgarh appears to have beckoned Bihar’s prohibition protagonist and CM Nitish Kumar, who has accepted an invite to lead an anti-liquor campaign in the central India state.   The invitation was extended to Nitish, who is also the president of JD (U), by a delegation of party workers from Chhattisgarh, who met him in Patna on Thursday.    Nitish shared with them the experience of prohibition in Bihar and motivated them to prepare ground for the same in their state. Sources said Nitish would address a public meeting in Chhattisgarh, but the date was not yet finalised.    “Around 40 party workers from different parts of Chhattisgarh came. An anti-liquor campaign is already going on in our state and we are keen to involve NItish in it as he is a symbolic face of prohibition in the country,” a member of the delegation said, adding they had requested Nitish to visit Chhattisgarh either on March 25 or 26.    Nitish enforced prohibition in Bihar on April 5 last year. The state legislature has enacted a law that prescribes arguably the harshest provisions for liquor trade and consumption in the state.    Soon after becoming the JD (U) national president last year, Nitish held public meetings in support of prohibition in UP, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, among other places. He has also repeatedly urged PM Narendra Modi to enforce prohibition across the country.
