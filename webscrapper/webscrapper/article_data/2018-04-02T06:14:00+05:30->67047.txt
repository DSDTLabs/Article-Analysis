MARGAO: Voluntary organisations on Saturday condemned the ‘irrational decision’ taken by the town and country planning ( ) minister   of bringing into force the Regional Plan (RP) 2021 across Goa. They further demanded that the RP 2021 be scrapped terming it as ‘anti-Goa’ and opined the need for a new pro-Goa plan to be drafted ‘for the sustainable development of Goa.’

 Citizens and civil society organisations expressed their shock regarding ‘Sardesai’s decision of bringing into force the RP 2021 that was frozen due to massive increases in illegal settlement for profits for builders and land sharks.’ They cautioned   that ‘any permissions given based on the RP 2021 shall be construed as a corrupt act and he shall be personally responsible and taken to task for the corruption.’ They demanded that all eco-sensitive lands be removed from settlement zones.
