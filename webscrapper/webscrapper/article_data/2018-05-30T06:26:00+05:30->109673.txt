Kolkata: A vacation bench of the Calcutta High Court on Tuesday set aside BJP leader   Roy’s plea for no coercive action and referred the matter to the regular bench. 

 Bijpur police have lodged 10 FIRs in an alleged money- for-job scam in which they have named Mukul as an accused. His brother-in-law Srijan Roy was arrested from New Delhi earlier.
 
 “We have submitted a report from the ministry of railways with the court. The judge has referred the case to the regular bench,” said public prosecutor Pradipta Ganguly. 
 
 According to Sudipta Maitra, the advocate representing Mukul, the FIR was registered in December 2017. 
 
 “We came to know about it a few days back and we have pleaded in court that Mukul Roy is no way linked to the case. We moved the court on June 25,” Maitra said.
