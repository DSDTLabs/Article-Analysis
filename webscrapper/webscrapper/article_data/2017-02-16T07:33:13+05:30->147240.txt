AHMEDABAD:   who earlier used small cars to bring   into Gujarat from Rajasthan are now using two wheelers, especially   with large glove boxes or storage compartments. Krishnanagar police late on Tuesday night nabbed eight such smugglers, with four scooters at Chiloda Circle. 

 “We found 239 liquor  , worth Rs 54,650,” said a police official. 
 
 Senior police officials said that on interrogating the accused it came to light that a bootlegger, Ratansinh of Bicchuvada in Rajasthan, loaded liquor consignments on to their scooters, to be handed to one Sonu of Sardarnagar at a particular hotel.
 
 Police officials said they have launched a manhunt to nab Sonu.
 
 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, bootleggers would smuggle liquor into the state in trucks. As prohibition grew more stringent, they started using small cars.
 
 “Bootleggers would bring consignments in trucks and transfer them into small cars, near the Gujarat border to evade scrutiny at police check points. Now, when police have come down heavily on bootleggers, they have started using two wheelers to smuggle liquor into the state through the Rajasthan border,” a senior police official said.
