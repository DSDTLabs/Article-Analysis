Directed by  , the play 
  brings back the nostalgic elements of one’s life and strives to draw the audiences’ attention towards the effects of progress and globalization.

  It is not just the forests and villages that are swept by the waves of development and globalization, even the cities are caught in the web and have lost their charm and glory. In the mad rush for development, the cultural roots are washed away and this trend is spreading like an epidemic. The people of the city wearing a proud badge of progress, when they turn around and look at the places from where they grew up, are not only surprised but shocked. It is as important to save the cultural traits of a city as it is to save a forest or a village. 
 
  A group of friends caught in the web of globalization plan to meet at a place, where they had spent their childhood and that place is Mavinagudi Colony ( ). As the name itself suggests, a mango tree is the focal point. And this tree is now on the verge of being destroyed for the development of the area. The friends decide to meet under the tree before it is brought down. Recollecting their childhood memories, they spend a few hours reliving those joyous moments. 
 
  The play is scheduled to take place at   on March 21 (7.30 pm).
