NAGPUR: With three weeks more for   (PMGKY) to end, the Nagpur office of income tax department has got disclosures to the tune of Rs36 crore. This comes from 18-20 individuals.

 The Nagpur office covers entire   as well as   and   districts. Under PMGKY, one can disclose his unaccounted cash or deposits.
 
 Sources privy to implementation of the scheme say there is a target of over Rs2 lakh crore in the entire country. The response in many other centres is, however, within single digit. 
 
 Under the scheme, the disclosed cash or bank deposits are taxed at 49.9% and a quarter of the amount has to be kept in the PMGKY account for a period of four years without interest. The account can be opened in any of the scheduled banks. But many banks are not geared up yet to accept the deposits as the systems have not been tuned to account for the funds.
 
 Due to this, accounts have not been opened for many who have made the disclosures too, said sources. A number of banks have not tuned their software to accept the interest free deposits. Except for 2-3 banks, majority of the PSU banks have not yet geared up yet, said sources.
 
 The banks accept TDS and tax levied in regular course. However, there is a different pro forma for the payment under PMGKY. This includes the tax and deposit components. The forms can be downloaded from the income tax website. However, the banksâ€™ systems too have to be tuned in to accept the new category of deposits, said sources. The matter was taken up by the department which is expecting an early solution. 
 
 TOI inquired at some of the banks and could find that officials in branches of major banks did not have any idea of the scheme at all. 
 
 On low response to the scheme, chartered accountants say it is expected that it may pick up as the last date would close in. Moreover, 49.9% of tax is considered to be too high. This is also one of the major deterrents, said tax practitioners.
