LUCKNOW: A policeman's wife died during a brawl at her house in   in Mahanagar police station area on Tuesday. The family has accused a constable and his son for the death.
The victim, 55-year-old Vimlesh, lived with her husband   in a staff quarter. Her husband is presently posted in vigilance headquarters. Around 4.30pm, their son Deepak had a fight with the son of constable Anil Yadav -who lives with his family on the first floor of the same building -over some repair work that the latter was getting done in his room. As arguments got out of hand, Vimlesh reached the scene to intervene.
 
 Dinesh alleged that Anil's son pushed his wife and she fell down the stairs. “She suffered injuries and died on the way to hospital,“ he said. “The woman was old and was probably in a state of shock when the two boys started fighting,“ police spokesman   said.
 
 Circle Officer (Police Lines)   told ToI, “We are probing the matter on the basis of the complaint of Vimlesh's son. An autopsy would determine the exact cause of death.“
