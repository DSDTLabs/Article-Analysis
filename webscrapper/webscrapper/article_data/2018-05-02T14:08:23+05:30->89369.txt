 Gulzar has penned songs for 'Raazi', which is directed by his   Jaideep told "That was the first day of the shoot and after finishing my make-up when I came out on the set, I met Vishal Bhardwaj, who also came to visit us. We all (actors) felt very blessed. I met him and then went to my position to set my mood before the camera roll."
 
 "Suddenly I realised that there was a silence on the set. I just looked around and saw the dynamic personality (Gulzar) dressed in white standing before us. I cannot express in words how exactly I was feeling. I was in awe. I touched his feet, took blessings and there was that moment of butterflies in the stomach."
 
 "However, I came back to my position and started getting myself into the zone of the character when I heard Meghna telling Gulzar saab, 'Daddy, why don't you stay back to see our first shot? Please sit with us?'"
 
 Jaideep said he felt very nervous to realise that he had to perform before Gulzar.
 
 "Look, we all are his fans. It was our good fortune to get his blessings on the first day of our shooting. But performing in front of him... Oh, God, I felt so conscious and nervous at the same time. I think he noticed it, and he exchanged a glace with me and smiled afterwards," said the 'Gangs of Wasseypur' actor.
 
 "Thankfully, the shot went well and he left after that. But I must mention that all of us are really lucky to have had two icons like Vishalji and Gulzar saab on the first day of our shooting."
 
 In 'Raazi', releasing on May 11, Jaideep plays a character named Khalid Mir.
