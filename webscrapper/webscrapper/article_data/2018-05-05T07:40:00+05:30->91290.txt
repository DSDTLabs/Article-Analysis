Chandigarh: The INLD and BSP on Friday reiterated their commitment to implement the Swaminathan committee report and complete SYL canal after the alliance is voted to power in the assembly elections.

 Leaders of the two parties â€” Abhay Singh Chautala (INLD) and Parkash Bharti (BSP) announced this in a public meeting ahead of the court arrest programe in Yamunanagar.
 
 Accusing the government of betraying the cause of farmers, Chautala said that Dadupur Nalvi canal scheme was scrapped because it did not want to pay enhanced compensation to farmers as directed by the Supreme Court.
 
 He said the SYL canal was essential for the survival of Yamunanagar, Ambala and Kurukeshtra districts as the groundwater was fast depleting. The canal would not only irrigate the lands of these districts but also recharge the groundwater, he said.
