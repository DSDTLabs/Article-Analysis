The websites for both the Assembly and Council can be accessed at http:www.telanganalegislature.org.in, where a user can choose the language option.
 
 Calling it a 'milestone' in the less than three year existence of India's newest state, the Speaker said that people no longer need to feel excluded from accessing information online due to language issues. “People can know what their representatives are doing, what questions they are asking,“ he said.
 
 The Telugu website was launched by Madhusudhana Chary, while the Urdu website was unveiled by Council chairman  . A portal for member login was launched by legislative affairs minister T   and the portal for departmental services by deputy speaker of the Assembly M Padma Devender Reddy. Goud said that some information is already available on the website while more is being added to make it comprehensive.
