Patna: A fully furnished eye bank would become functional at the superspecialty eye hospital at Rajendra Nagar in the next four months and efforts were also being made to start cancer screening centres in five districts by April this year, said health minister   in the legislative assembly on Friday. He was replying to the starred question of public accounts committee (PAC) chairman   and the short notice question of BJP member Sanjay Sarawagi.

 The minister said the decision to open the eye bank at the Rajendra Nagar eye hospital had been taken in May 2014, but it required proper infrastructure and the purchase of necessary equipment. 
 
 In his supplementary question, the PAC chairman said the opening of an eye bank had also been mooted for Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIS) in May 2014, but the IGIMS succeeded in starting it in five months. Stating that the opening of another eye bank at the Rajendra Nagar hospital would serve a great purpose, as comparatively large number of people had been coming forward to voluntarily donate their eyes.
 
 In reply to the question of Sarawagi, the health minister said the screening centres for the detection of cervical and breast cancers would be established in Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Rohtas, East Champaran and West Champaran districts, adding that they would be functional in the next five months. 
 
 In reply to the short notice question of BJP member Tarkishore Prasad, the health minister said the girl child mortality rate in Bihar was 17%. The health department has initiated several steps to reduce it through mass awareness programme regarding significance of girl child, opening of 36 special newborn care units and 550 newborn care units in the state.
