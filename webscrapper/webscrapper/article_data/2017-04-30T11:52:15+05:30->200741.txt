 While Joshana's 11-6, 11-4, 11-8 victory against sixth seed Tong Tsz Wing was to be expected considering her standing as the No 2 seed, it was Dipika who produced some scintillating squash to usurp the top-seeded Annie Au of Hong Kong 11-9, 7-11, 11-7, 11-9. After winning the first game 11-9, Dipika ran away to a 7-3 lead in the second game.
