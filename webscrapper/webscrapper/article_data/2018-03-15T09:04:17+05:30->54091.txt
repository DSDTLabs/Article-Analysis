HYDERABAD: In the run-up to this World Sparrow Day on March 20, nature enthusiasts will set up ‘feeders’ and nests at various places in the city to ensure that the sparrows return to Hyderabad . The house sparrow left cities and towns decades ago for reasons ranging from change in human lifestyle to environmental pollution.

 A few sparrows that have returned to the city of late have been populating in certain pockets of Hyderabad. Nature enthusiasts have decided to ensure that these sparrows remain in the city. They will also make efforts to facilitate the return of more sparrows from rural areas abutting Hyderabad.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 According to   of the Nature Forever Society ( ), sparrow supports in New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore will reach out to citizens to encourage them to undertake the conservation of house sparrows at the grassroots level by creating a habitat for the diminutive species and participating in functional conservation initiatives.
 
 “In Hyderabad, NFS will identify localities and communities that have a sparrow population and install feeders to provide a continuous source of food. The move is aimed at sensitizing people that it is their fundamental duty to protect the common birds living in their communities,” Dilawar told TOI. He said there will also be programmes in Johnson Grammar School, Nacharam, and residential colonies in Secunderabad. The main event will be held on Wipro campus in   here.   of NFS will coordinate the events in Hyderabad.
 
 Hundreds of bird feeders will be installed to help sparrows, as lack of food and nesting sites are among the primary factors for the decline of house sparrows.
