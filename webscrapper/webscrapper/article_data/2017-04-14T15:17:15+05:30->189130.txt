Actress   is one of the television industry's biggest faces. over the years,   has earned a lot of name and fame due to her performance of   on the show  .
 
  The actress had recently posted a tweet about struggling actors and new actors that created a buzz in the industry. People were wondering about the reason that made her put up the tweet. Well, Divyanka has now clarified what she wanted to say in the first place.
  
  In a live conversation with The Times Of India, Divyanka said,"New Actors don't get enough respect. They are ready to slog and work hard as much as needed but that's the reason why they are exploited."
  
  She further explained that new actors try to give their best to the show but the makers always exploit them. She further added, "Established actors are spoken to very peacefully but new actors go through a lot of trouble. Like even when they are in the washroom, their door is knocked and they are forced to hurry up and shoot. This is just an example but discrimination in the industry is on humanitarian grounds."
  
  She also said, "An actor's fame is all that he has got. A production laborer can leave his job and still get another one. But if an actor leaves his show all of a sudden, his name gets spoiled and then no other producer will offer him or her another show. Hence these new actors have to give in to the production's demands."
  
  She also spoke about how actors have no options for retirement. She said,"Actors have no sort of privileges for retirement. if they don't get shows there is no income. So most of the time they have to be dependent on their savings. But the problem here is that some actors don't even earn enough to save something out of their payments. Now once a show is done, it is replayed for years and years in different countries and on different channels so actors should get some sort of royalties for their work even after their show is done."
