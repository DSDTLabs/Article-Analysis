MUMBAI: With no contractor showing interest in desilting the city’s drains for the second year in a row, the   wants its ward-level officials to initiate  , just like last year. The civic body has decided to ask its officials to take help from  .

 According to BMC officials, cleaning of major drains will begin on April 1, and that of minor drains on April 7. 
 
 A   meeting held by   along with deputy municipal commissioners on Tuesday evening decided that as no contractor has shown interest in cleaning minor drains, ward level staff should initiate the work taking the help of NGO workers. 
 
 While contractors have shown interest in taking up desilting of major nullahs, which span across 251 km, there has been no bid for cleaning the minor ones despite the civic body floating tenders four times. The BMC has floated tenders worth Rs 60 crore for major nullahs and Rs 29.62 crore for minor nullahs. 
 
 Last year too, the BMC was unable to get contracto-rs for cleaning minor drains. Sources say this is a fallout of the action that the BMC took against errant contractors in the desilting scam that came to light in 2015. On June 19, 2015, when the city received heavy rainfall, the BMC’s claims of being rain-ready went down the drain as not just low-lying areas, but several other areas were also flooded, raising qu-estions about the pre-monsoon desilting work. A probe revealed a desilting scam, which led to suspension of 14 civic officials and FIRs against errant contractors. 
 
 An official said, “Machinery can be used for cleaning major nullahs. However, that is not often possible for cleaning minor nullahs, making it a tedious process. Getting labourers is also a major issue.”
