NEW DELHI: The wheels of controversial businessman   process have begun to roll, with the British government sending   to a district judge, the first step towards a judicial decision that could send him back to India to face a court.

 “The UK home department on February 21 conveyed that India’s request for the extradition of Mallya has been certified by the secretary of state and sent to the Westminster magistrates' court for a district judge to consider the issue of releasing of a warrant,” MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay said. Mallya is wanted with regard to pending cases of loan default case totalling over Rs 9,000 crore.
 
 Baglay said a formal   in line with the   was handed over to the British high commission here through a note verbale on February 8.
 
 The British government decision seems to have followed the Indian request. Finance minister Arun Jaitley, who was in UK last month, was told by the British leadership that they would take a “positive” view of the matter.
 
 While handing over the request, India had asserted that it has a “legitimate” case against Mallya and maintained that if an extradition request is honoured, it would show British “sensitivity towards our concerns”.
 
 The extradition process involves a number of steps, including a decision by the judge whether to issue a warrant of arrest. In case of a warrant, the person is arrested and brought before the court for preliminary hearing, followed by an extradition hearing ahead of a final decision by the secretary of state.
 
 The wanted person has a right to appeal to the higher courts against any decision all the way up to the Supreme Court. In January this year, a CBI court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya in the Rs 720-crore IDBI Bank loan default case. Mallya, whose now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines owes more than Rs 9,000 crore to various banks, had fled India on March 2, 2016.
