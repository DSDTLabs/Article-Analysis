KANPUR: Taking a dig at the proposed alliance between   (BSP) and   (SP), state   chief Mahendra Nath Pandey said it is alliance between a snake and a mole.

 Participating in the programme ‘Ek saal, nai misaal’ in Fatehpur on Sunday, Pandey said, “Let there be an alliance between a snake and a mole... you (BJP workers) have to make alliance with the masses because no other alliance will dare to stand in front of your alliance.”
 
 Without taking name, the BJP leader also took swipe at   president   saying that situation has come to such a pass that the chief of the country’s oldest political party is wearing `janeu’ (sacred thread) to tell people that he is also a Hindu.
 
 He alleged that BSP and SP both had served their personal interests while supporting   during its ten years rule.
 
 
 “They only do drama in public.   Singh says he will send   to jail while Mayawati threatens to send Mulayam to jail, but did you ever find any of the two leaders in jail?” Pandey asked.
 
 
 He said that it should be the target of every party worker to win all 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh in 2019 elections.
