NEW DELHI: A   was raped and strangled by a   at a construction site in   on Thursday. The accused, who was caught later, sexually assaulted the child when she had gone to relieve herself in a forested area. The juvenile’s father and relatives work at the same construction site as the child’s parents.

 The incident was reported on Thursday when a security guard at a DDA construction site in Narela found the 16-year-old youth digging a pit with the girl lying beside it. He alerted the labourers at the camp who caught the accused and handed him over to the police.
 
 The girl’s parents left for work in the morning leaving her and her six-month-old brother at home. When she left for the forested area to relieve herself in the afternoon, the youth dragged her into a semi-constructed bathroom and raped her. When the child tried shouting for help, he strangled her with his T-shirt and smashed her face with a brick.
 
 The youth had planned to leave her body in the bathroom and flee, but stopped after seeing her friends playing nearby. After the children left, he carried the body to the nearby bushes and started digging a pit. One of the child’s friends who was looking for her saw this and alerted a security guard.
 
 The girl’s body was sent for autopsy to a government hospital where doctors confirmed sexual assault. “A case under POCSO and IPC sections of rape and murder has been registered against the teenager at Narela police station. He was produced before the juvenile justice board and sent to a reform home,” said DCP (Rohini) MN Tewari.
 
 Police said that the labourers employed by a private firm contracted by DDA are mostly migrants from eastern UP and Bihar.
 
 The labourers staged a protest on Friday against the construction company demanding better sanitation facilities at the camp. They said children and women relieve themselves in public as the bathrooms are partially constructed.
