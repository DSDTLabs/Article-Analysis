CHENNAI: Police on Thursday arrested a man after he poisoned to death at least seven dogs in Puliyarai Kottai near Madurantakam in   district. 

 Police learned about the culling on Wednesday and locals informed them that Ganapathy, 56, a villager had killed the dogs.
 
  of India general manager Dawn Williams said he received a complaint that a local had poisoned the dogs.
 
 "Ganapathy killed three dogs on Wednesday and four more on Thursday morning," Williams said. "He laced dry fish with poison and gave them to the dogs to eat. A little after they ate the poisoned fish, the animals started to die."
 
 Williams visited the village but was able to retrieve only five carcasses. He informed the local police.
 
 The Sithamur police arrived in Puliyarai Kottai, arrested Ganapathy and took him to the station.
 
 "News about killing of dogs appeared in the vernacular media," Williams said. "Locals called Blue Cross and informed us about the killings."
 
 One of the dead dogs, a female, had a day-old puppy, which has not opened its eyes as yet. "I'm not sure that it will survive without its mother's milk."
 
 Police filed cases against Ganapathy under relevant sections of the IPC for killing and maiming animals and also booked him under the Prevention of Cruelties to Animals Act.
 
 Williams sent the dogs' carcasses to   so veterinarians could conduct a postmortem and establish the cause of death, he said.
 
 Williams said members of the public can alert him on his phone (9176025265) if they witness instances of animal torture or unauthorised killing of animals.
