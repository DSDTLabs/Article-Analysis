KOLHAPUR: The district administration will organise   at all villages on January 30 to spread awareness among people on leprosy.

 A drive will be launched to identify leprosy patients in 40 pockets across the district between February 6 and 21. An official from the   said that the campaign will eradicate leprosy from the country and will be held at all districts across the country during this period.
 
 Harshala Vedak, assistant director for leprosy of the   for Kolhapur district, said, “The drive aims to spread awareness among the people about the endemic disease. On January 30, special gram sabhas will be held at each village across the district. Each villager will be told about leprosy and this will help lower the stigma surrounding the disease.”
 
 Vedak said that along with this a campaign focusing on leprosy will be undertaken. “This will involve a door-to-door surveillance activity especially in low endemic areas, where the grade II disability and child cases were detected in 2016. The drive will be launched with the help of health workers and   (Asha) workers from the district,” she said.
 
 “There are still new cases coming in with the rising percentage of grade II disability and child cases. The state ranks third in the leprosy cases in the country. We have identified 40 hotspots in the Kolhapur district. In the drive from February 6 to 21, all people from these pockets will be checked for any likely infections. The survey’s details as well as check-ups conducted by health officers from the district will be submitted to the commissioner of the health Services of the state,” she said.
 
 She added that along with this an awareness drive will also be taken up to educate people living in areas with poor road connectivity and transportation facilities. “The drive will also be held in hilly areas and zones with a high tribal population, which is hard to reach to provide healthcare services routinely,” she said.
