LUCKNOW: The city will get rid of garbage mess, but only for a week. The   on Thursday released Rs 50 lakh to its private partner in waste management,  . 

 Eco Green had withdrawn from   from houses and roads from May 29 on the grounds that   had not cleared its dues amounting to Rs 23 crore. The company had said that it was unable to buy fuel for garbage vehicles and pay salaries to its staff owing to cash crunch.
 
 The immediate effect was seen across the city as garbage piled up on main roads and in colonies. 
 
 Through its reports TOI had been highlighting how the city was turning into a trash mess in the absence of garbage collectors. Taking cognizance of TOI reports, the government swung into action and directed LMC to release partial funds to the company so that work doesn't stop. Divisional commissioner Lucknow, Anil Garg, has directed additional municipal commissioner   to ensure that garbage is regularly picked from colonies and streets. Further, Lucknow Municipal Corporation has been told to keep releasing funds to Eco Green so that it can continue with its duties of collection, transportation and treatment of waste. 
 
 But Eco Green employees said that Rs 50 lakh will only suffice the demand of fuel and salaries for a week and for further continuation they will need more funds from the municipal corporation.
