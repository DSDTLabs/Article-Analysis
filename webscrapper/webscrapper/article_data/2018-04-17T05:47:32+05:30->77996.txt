Actress   said she practised crying as a child.

 
  
 "I would spend hours in front of the mirror, pretending to be someone else, making myself cry, trying out accents - I just loved it, and would literally spend the whole day doing that. I was really lucky, because some mothers would have thought 'Oh my God my child is just crazy', but my mum actually said 'Ah, she has a talent, she has an interest'," Harris said.
 
 "She enrolled me at the  , and everything started from there, because they had an agency attached to the school and I started auditioning and got jobs," Harris added.
 
 Reportedly, the actress said she moved into a "weird profession" in light of her shy nature.
 
 "What I really enjoyed was losing myself in character, finding out what it was like to be someone else, and getting inside that and disappearing, that's what I really loved as a child," she said.
 
 She has overcome her shyness.
 
 Harris added: "I'm not shy anymore, but I'm not comfortable being in the spotlight, I'm not someone that enjoys being observed. I'm more of an observer, but I do still love that thing of where you find a character to such an extent that you actually feel like someone else, there's a freedom in that which I really enjoy."
