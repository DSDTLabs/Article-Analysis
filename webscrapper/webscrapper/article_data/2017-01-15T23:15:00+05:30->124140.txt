Mangaluru: The   Alumni Association will host the largest   of its kind on Sunday, at NITK beach near here. 

 This programme is aimed at improving health and fitness of the young India. According to the organizers, it is a growing concern today that younger generation is completely addicted to mobile phones/laptops and seldom come out of their rooms/hostels and take part in games and social activities.
 
 To raise awareness about the importance of health and fitness, the NITK   has decided to host this marathon for the students. With over 4000 plus registrants and more expected, this beach run will be a first of itâ€™s kind in Mangaluru.
 
 The programme will be flagged off at 6.45am on NITK beach by NITK Alumni Association. The 10km run will start at 6.45am, followed by the 6 km run at 7.45am and 3.3 km run at 8.15am. The marathon route will cover the NITK beach and the NITK campus.
