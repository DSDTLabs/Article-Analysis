CHENNAI: Long queues at the immigration counters inconvenience passengers at Chennai airport. Though international terminal is seeing an increase in passenger traffic due to summer holidays, immigration check continues to be slow. Departing and arriving travellers have to stand in queue for more than two hours to clear immigration check. 

 Irate passengers tweeted about their plight and tagged   and the civil aviation ministry on Saturday. A tweet read by a passenger read, “Total chaos at immigration ...More than 500 people in queue...” He further says he had landed at 12.04 am and 45 minutes after that there were 100 people at the queue. It took an hour for him to clear the immigration check at Chennai airport. 
 
 Frequent flyers say immigration authorities at the airport were not realising the importance of manning all the counters. Two days ago, there was a huge crowd of more than 500 to 1000 people but only a few counters were working at the departure terminal a couple of days ago, said a traveller. 
 
 AAI responding to one of the tweets said “There was an unprecedented movement of passengers from 500 to 1000 between 11.15pm and 12.15am which led to the delay.”
 
  national president   said, “AAI tells us there is a shortage of people and the home ministry is yet to allot staff for immigration. But why should there be a delay to allot people. Chennai airport should be treated better.”
