NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: The government is ready to talk to all stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir without pre-conditions,   general secretary  , who arrived in Srinagar on Thursday, said.

 "We have said from the beginning and we have maintained that our doors are open to all the stakeholders in the state, they are welcome to come and have a dialogue with the state government as well as whoever wants to talk to the central government, we are open to a dialogue," Madhav said when asked if talks would be held with separatists in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
 "The question should be asked to those who do not want to go for dialogue," he said, in what was seen as a hint at the separatists. Speaking to reporters, Madhav said, "If they (separatists) wish, they can have a dialogue with the state government and they can have talks with New Delhi as well."
 
 Asked what if the separatists were willing to talk, Madhav said, "Then it will be looked into by the appropriate people."
 
 He indicated the Hurriyat had so far shown no inclination to talk to either the state government or the Centre and made it clear that there could be no conditions like cessation of security operations. Contacted over phone, he said talks could be held only with those who were willing. and did not raise conditions for such an engagement.
 
 Hurriyat leaders have faced the heat from central agencies in the context of alleged cases of hawala funding of street violence in Kashmir and manipulation of trade across the Line of Control.
 
 The Union government does not seem to be keen to let up what agencies say is a bid to choke funding of terrorists and violent protests.
