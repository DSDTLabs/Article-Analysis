MUMBAI: Hoping to improve quality of education and promote teaching as a profession, a teachers’ group here has written to   Narendra Modi and minister of human resource development   demanding better pay and higher budget-spending on education. 

  sent out a list of 18 demands as part of an all-India movement. Anil Bornare, from the association, said, “The problem in the sixth pay commission must be rectified, and the seventh pay commission must be implemented across the country. It is important teachers are paid well to ensure teaching continues to remain a lucrative career and attracts the best minds.” Among other service-related demands are extension of retirement age to 65, relief from non-academic tasks and appointments on a permanent basis.
 
 The group demanded that spending on education be raised to 10% of the country’s GDP and 30% of the state’s budget.
 
 The teachers also want a greater say in decisions related to education. “Government and political interference in education must be stopped and teachers must be involved when a scheme or programme is introduced. Implementation of Acts such as Right to Education must be done in true spirit, so that they benefit the needy and are not misused,” said Bornare. The group also wants a common academic calendar and to put an end to commercialisation.
 
 The letter, along with others from across the country, will be sent to the central government through collectors’ offices.
