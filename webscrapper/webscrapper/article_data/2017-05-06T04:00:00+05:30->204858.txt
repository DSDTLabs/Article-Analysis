AHMEDABAD:   on Friday ordered that   of a four-year-boy be given to his mother, despite a memorandum of understanding between the parents stating that the son would stay with the father.

  In this case, a Christian couple living in Bangalore got married, but due to severe marital disputes they decided to separate. They entered into an MoU, by which their son’s custody was to remain with the father.
 
 A few months after their separation, the mother approached a magisterial court and demanded custody of the child. She succeeded, but the sessions court reversed the order, citing the MoU. The dispute finally reached the high court.
 
 According to woman’s counsel Johnsy Macwan, Justice J B Pardiwala ordered that the child’s custody should be given to the mother and the father will have visitation rights at least till he approaches the appropriate court for the child’s custody under the Guardians and Wards Act. The court observed, “Whenever a question of custody of minor children arises, the courts have always approached the issue as a more humanitarian rather than legal problem. In the case of infants, courts have always leaned in favour of the mother taking care of extremely young impressionable children unless it is brought on record that the mother suffers from some disqualification by virtue of her character, total inability to take care of the child or such other handicap. Question of custody of minor children is never a static problem and the issue can be re-examined at any stage.”
