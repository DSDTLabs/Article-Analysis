 and   have teamed up for the upcoming romantic comedy ‘Dil Juunglee’, which is all set to hit screens during the Valentine’s Day weekend. When BT quizzed Saqib about his role in the movie, the   ka munda shared, “It’s not a film where I had to lock myself in a room to get into character. It’s a feel-good and fun movie. I have grown up in South Delhi and coincidentally, my character Sumit Uppal in the film is from Lajpat Nagar, where I spent my childhood. So when I read the script, I thought nobody else, but I should be doing this film. Not because I would play the character well, but for the simple reason that I have lived that life.”

 The film’s story hinges on how the concept of love changes as people age. Saqib elaborated, “The definition of love keeps evolving. The film’s story captures the innocence and immaturity associated with love when you are 18 and then shifts focus to a much more mature understanding of it. That’s not all; it also delves into how your friends influence your choices about love.”
 
 Interestingly, Saqib also revealed how the cast has managed to stay in touch, long after the film's shoot wrapped up. He said, “The entire cast hit it off from the first day. In fact, we have a common messenger group called Launda, even though there are seven girls and only three boys in the group. We are constantly in touch with each other.”
