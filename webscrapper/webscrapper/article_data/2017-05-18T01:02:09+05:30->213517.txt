 The workers said that the government was deliberately misrepresenting facts to establish that the plant was making losses. They alleged that the audit reports are fudged to make it appear like the plant was failing in yielding profits. “We have been consistently improving the output and revenue. The products we make are used in various sectors including defense and aviation. If such a unit is given to the private sector it might even compromise national security,’’ said another protester. The workers vowed that they would prevent privatization of the plant at any cost.
