VADODARA: For a change, councillors of opposition Congress as well as ruling   were on the same page in raising the demand for reorganizing the administrative wards of the   ( ). 

 They made representations in Tuesday’s general board meeting stating that the present demarcation was causing a lot of inconvenience to citizens. The VMC has a system wherein the election wards are different from administrative wards. The VMC has 12 administrative wards and 19 election wards areas are divided amongst these. Opposition leader   on Tuesday pointed out that the division was such that citizens had to travel several kilometres to reach the administrative ward offices. BJP’s Chandrakant Thakkar made similar observations.
 
 Former opposition leader and Congress councillor Chirag Zaveri said mayor Bharat Dangar had earlier sought that a separate administrative office should be created for each election ward to streamline things. But this had not materialised as the VMC was examining the financial implications of taking such a step.
 
 Some members of the BJP poitned out that since VMC is now online and has started a call centre, citizens need not go to the ward office unless really needed. The opposition, however, slammed these claims stating that at times there was no satisfactory response to complaints through these modes.
