NEW DELHI: The old saying that sportsmen leave their rivalries on the field might sometimes be true of politics too. PM Narendra Modi’s jibe at his predecessor   bathing with a raincoat on — a suggestion that Singh was able to evade the taint of scams that unfolded during his tenure — came in for some light-hearted comment at a tea hosted by   Speaker   after the House adjourned on Thursday.

 The informal meeting of government and opposition leaders, which is a ritual after   breaks, saw   leader   greet PM   with the remark “aap ne jaate jaate ye mushkil kar di (you have created a difficulty on your wayout)”.
 
 Kharge possibly referred to the end of the first half of the budget session but Modi quickly assured him that “ye jaate jaate aur aate aate hua hai (this has happened while leaving as well as arriving)”, the repartee indicating that the PM intends to be very much around.
 
 The tea saw political leaders letting their hair down and engaging in jocular exchanges, with the PM appearing in good humour despite the contentious and sometimes acrimonious debates in Parliament over issues like demonetisation.
 
 Finance minister  , who announced an AIIMS for Telangana in his reply in Lok Sabha, brought this to the notice of the PM in the presence of   floor leader Jitendra Reddy. 
 
 The AIIMS decision was not part of his Budget presentation. PM Modi immediately punned on AIIMS, saying it had come to “take aim” and congratulated Reddy on Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s request being accepted by the Centre. The informal setting eased the tensions of Parliament as well as electioneering.
 
 On Friday, things were back to normal with Modi telling a rally in Haridwar that while he had no wish to cross the boundaries of conduct, he would not put up with “anaap-shanaap (loose talk)” about the government, more than indicating that he will respond in kind.
