GHAZIABAD: A 40-year-old daily wager, a resident of Muradnagar, was awarded   on Friday for murdering his   seven years back. He had stabbed his father-in-law over his refusal to give him Rs 55,000 to buy an auto rickshaw and also for not allowing his wife to return to him. 

 He had also injured his mother-in-law for which he was awarded another 10 years in jail.
 
 Additional district judge Satya Prakash Tripathi also imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 on the daily wager for the two offences. However, both the jail terms will run concurrently.
 
 The case pertains to Noorganj locality in Muradnagar police station. On July 4, 2011, Aas Mohammad had stabbed his father-in-law Mumtaz and mother-in-law Shehnaz with a knife. While Mumtaz succumbed to his injuries, his wife survived.
 
 Additional district government counsel Brij Mohan Sharma said, “Three months before the attack, Mohammad had given divorce to his wife Farida over his refusal to get money from his father to buy him an auto rickshaw. The woman had been living at her father’s house since then. On July 4, 2011, Mohammad went to Mumtaz’s house and insisted that his wife Farida return with him.”
 
 “When Mumtaz refused to agree to his demands, Mohammad, who was already angry with his father-in-law over the money issue, stabbed him. When Shehnaz tried to intervene, she was also attacked,” Sharma said.
 
 Farida had also given a statement against his husband.
