NEW DELHI:   has put in place an “anger management” plan in Punjab. Fearing a backlash from disappointed ticket-hopefuls,   has deputed party seniors to contain the damage.
 
  Make a personal phone call and assuage them immediately – this is the directive from Gandhi who feels any dissidence could cost the Congress the Assembly election.
  
  According to sources, Gandhi has directed state party chief Captain   and   and Asha Kumari to speak to ticket-seekers who have been denied tickets.
  
  A senior Congress leader told ET, “Most of the phone calls are being made by Captain. He has been asked by Gandhi to call the leaders and explain why they were denied tickets. The party leaders are also assuring the angry leaders that they would be accommodated if the Congress comes to power.”
  
  Congress is aware that it would have to put up a united front as a three-cornered contest could swing any way. The ticket distribution exercise has been marred by open internal fights in the screening committee meetings.
  
  Even Captain has been accused of accommodating leaders from SAD and AAP. The party fears that rebellion, especially from sitting MLAs denied ticket, could mar the party’s chances.
  
  “Even if there is no open rebellion, dropped candidates work quietly to harm the interests of the party candidate. Every rejected leader, especially a big leader or a sitting MLA, is being personally called, not once but several times to calm him down. He is being told that if the party comes to power he would be given a party post or nominated to a subordinate office,” said a central leader.
