Pune: The police on Tuesday said the woman arrested for kidnapping an eight-month-old baby from the railway station here had committed the crime to present the infant as her child to her husband. 

 The woman had faked pregnancy and left her husband’s home for “delivery” at her native village in Ratnagiri. Superintendent of police (GRP-Pune) Prabhkar Budhwant said, “We registered an offence of kidnapping against Ranjana, alias Anushka Ravindra Ranpise (41), of Walhekarwadi. Shewas married to a man 15 years younger. She already had two children from her first marriage before undergoing sterilization.” 
 
 During questioning, Ranpise told the police that she had faked the pregnancy to her second husband as she knew she could not conceive. Instead of going to Ratnagiri, she loitered around the railway station looking for couples with newborn babies.
 
 It was during one such search that Ranpise came across Laxmi Chabukswar of Solapur, who was staying near the station’s main gate with her husband and eight-month-old daughter. Ranpise befriended with the couple, who had come to Pune in search of a job, and kidnapped their child.
