MUMBAI: Decrying the delay in investigating the murder of police sub-inspector Ashwini Bidre-Gore, the opposition on Friday demanded the accused inspector   be dismissed from service. 

 The issue was raised in the legislative council through the calling attention motion. NCP legislators Hemant Takle, Vidya Chavan and others demanded that he be immediately sacked from the force. 
 
 Minister of state for home Ranjit Patil said Kurundkar and his two associates have already been arrested and Kurundkar has been suspended. 
 
 On the opposition demand that he be dismissed, Patil said the rules in this regard would be examined first and then action will be taken. On the President's medal awarded to Kurundkar, Patil said the state government has already written to the Centre for it to be revoked. He said it was not true that the medal was awarded to him after he was accused in the murder case. Rather he was awarded the medal on January 31, 2017, and arrested on December 7, 2017.
 
 In its written reply the government said Kurundkar had promised marriage to Bidre-Gore and alienated her from her family. However, Bidre-Gore's insistence on marriage annoyed Kurundkar who threatened to kill her. He later along with his associates kidnapped her and sent a false message to her brother-in-law that she was going to Uttar Pradesh for 4-6 months to attend a course on vipassana. Bidre-Gore (37), an official with the Navi Mumbai police human rights cell, went missing on April 11, 2016. During interrogation, one of the accused told police that she was killed by Kurundkar and her body stored in a refrigerator before being disposed of in Vasai creek.
