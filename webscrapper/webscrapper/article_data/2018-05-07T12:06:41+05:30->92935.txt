KOCHI: With the state government fixing Rs 2 lakh as fee to be paid by recipients of   from   (KNOS), financially backward patients are finding it difficult to get   surgeries done. The recipient will also have to pay Rs 1.5 lakh to the donor as the latter won't be able to go for work for three months after surgery. The medical and diagnostic bills of the donor also will have to be paid by the recipient and this has led to a crisis. 

 The new guidelines introduced by the government for organ transplantation and deceased donor organ transplantation have led to the these conditions. As per the guidelines, the fees thus collected can be used for the welfare of the  . 
 
 "The new clause that all the recipients will have to pay the fee and medical and diagnostic bills of the donors have created problems for the poor patients. They will also have to pay Rs 1.5 lakh to the donor as he or she will not be able to go for work for the three or four months post-surgery. So, the recipient will have to mop up at least Rs 4-5 lakh," said Fr Davis Chiramel, founder of accident care and transport service (ACTS) and Kidney Federation of India. 
 
 "The patients will also have to raise the money for transplantation as well. So, the transplantation surgeries of poor patients have come to a standstill. It is the responsibility of the government to bear such costs on behalf of the poor patients," Chiramel, an altruistic donor of kidney to an unrelated person, said. He said that the government should take measures to encourage voluntary donation.
 
 Officials with the KNOS said that the issue has already been brought to the notice of the government. " It is for raising funds for the welfare measures for the altruistic donors that the government stipulated such clauses. Now, many including some MLAs, have demanded the state government to revoke the clause. It is up to the government to decide on it," an official with KNOS said.
