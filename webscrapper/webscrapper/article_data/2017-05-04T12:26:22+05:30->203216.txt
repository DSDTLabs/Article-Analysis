PUNE: The umbrella organisation of villagers opposing the new Pune airport project has urged landowners of the seven villages in   taluka to discuss the compensation options offered by the state government. 

 The stand adopted by the organisation,  , hints at weakening of the villagers’ seven-month protest against the airport project. 
 
 Datta  , president of the organisation, told TOI on Tuesday that they needed to find out who were ready to provide plots in lieu of the compensation options so that it could decide on the future course of action.
 
 “After the state government’s April 29 meeting on the issue, we too held a meeting to discuss our next course of action. The people have been told to decide for themselves on whether they want to give their plots in return of any of the four options or not. They have been asked to discuss the options with their families and revert. There might be some or many willing to to opt for one option,” Dhurange said.
 
 The meeting, which was chaired by chief minister  , had approved the four compensation options offered by the district administration. 
 
 “We have convened a meeting of the landowners on Thursday evening. They will attend the meeting with their final decisions. Once it is done, we will plan our next course of action. Our stand remains same, but we cannot force people to be a part of the protest if they are willing to part with their land,” Dhurange said.
