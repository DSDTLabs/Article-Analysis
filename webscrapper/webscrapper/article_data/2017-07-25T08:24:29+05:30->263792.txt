YAVATMAL: Only 22   from   district, the epicenter of farm suicides, have received Rs10,000 loan waiver advance from public sector undertaking (PSU) banks. The PSU banks have found 1,49,689 farmers in the district eligible for the crop loan waiver announced by the state government. 

 State Bank of India has disbursed the amount to eight farmers while Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra to seven each. 
 
 The Gramin Bank has identified 11,806 farmers as eligible for the advance and disbursed the amount to 597 farmers.
 
 The Yavatmal District Central Cooperative (YDCC) Bank has identified 1,52,000 farmers as eligible for the loan waiver out of the 3,13,764 farmers across the district. It has demanded Rs135 crore from the government to grant the advance to farmers.
 
 According to the newly elected chairman of YDCC Bank Aman Gawande, the loan disbursement hasn’t started due to the indefinite strike by the Ghat Sachiv (block secretaries) for their long-pending demand of regular payment of salary.
 
 “The list of beneficiary farmers is with the agitating secretaries who are not ready to hand over the same to YDCC bank for auditing, without which the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank would not release the funds,” said Gawande.
