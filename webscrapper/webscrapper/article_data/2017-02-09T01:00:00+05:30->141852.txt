This was a one-stop shop for Chennaiites who love exquisite stuff. Our photog spotted these ladies at the venue who looked happy checking out the stuff. Among others, was choreographer Jeffery Vardon. Prachi spent some quality time catching up with other fashionistas and designers at the venue. Maha was a headturner. The short palazzo she sported looked perfect on her. Her captivating smile and stylish dressing sense grabbed the attention of the shutterbugs. All in all, it was just the right place for them explore todayâ€™s trends.
