BENGALURU: YouTube and Google Hangout may come as a saviour for engineering and polytechnic students in rural areas of the state where there are shortage of teachers. Students can log in to the   (DTE) studio channel to listen to lectures from experts on several topics.

 On Friday,  , from  , Bengaluru was at the DTE studio to deliver a trial lecture on “Role of CDTP in community development” to 10 colleges from rural areas connected to the technical education department directly. The lecture was streamed live and uploaded on DTE’s YouTube channel, which will give access to viewers who missed the live video. 
 
 “The idea is to connect experts from different subjects, sitting in government engineering and polytechnic colleges across the state, to students in rural areas like Bidar, Bagalkot, Ballari and Belagavi, where the number of lecturers are almost 50% of urban areas,” said H U Talwar, DTE director.
 
 “This is for the first time DTE will be educating over 20,000 students by streaming lectures live. The lecturers do not require special training; they just need a laptop with a webcam and keep their presentation ready. They can connect to studio here online and the lecture will be streamed live,” added Talwar.
 
 To synchronize the lectures, DTE has written to all 81 government polytechnics and 11 government engineering colleges to list out the topics for which students need lectures and also the subjects taught by less teachers. 
 
 “Based on this, we will plan lectures for them twice a day, where 10 colleges can be connected and students can ask questions via Google Hangouts,” explained Talwar. The idea has been inspired from NITTTR Chandigarh, which used this method to train teachers from the institute. 
 
 As per official records, 289 posts of teaching staff are vacant in government engineering colleges out of 646 sanctioned posts, while there are 714 vacancies in government polytechnics out of 2812.
