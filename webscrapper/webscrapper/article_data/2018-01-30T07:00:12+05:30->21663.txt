 RML hospital director Dr   said, “A committee had been formed to probe the newborn’s death and the staff nurse was relocated to another ward. She was suspended on January 24 for delaying reporting the incident to the doctor.” He added that after talks with agitated nurses, it has been decided that “a speedy investigation into the case at the government level will be sought so that action can be taken accordingly on the nurse”.
 
 On January 20, Ruchi and   had blamed the hospital staff for the death of their newborn. “The fault was of the baby’s grandmother, who is also a ward helper at the hospital. She was seen feeding the child with a spoon which was uncalled for and led to the food pipe getting choked,” said the nurse who was suspended.
