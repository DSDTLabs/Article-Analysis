AURANGABAD: Civic chief   on Sunday said he has ordered an inquiry to check if the municipal authorities had switched on the beacon while travelling in his car to Mumbai.

  The municipal authorities who were travelling in the municipal chief’s official car had allegedly put on the beacon when the vehicle met with a minor accident on Friday. 
 
 Last month, the Union government had decided to put an end to the practice of mounting beacons on vehicles used by VIPs such as bureaucrats, the Prime Minister, chief ministers, central and state ministers and judges.
 
 On Friday, deputy municipal commissioner   and executive engineer   allegedly switched on the beacon while travelling to Mumbai to attend a crucial meeting. 
 
 The municipal chief was supposed to attend the meeting, but he could not go because of the special general body meeting that was conducted the same day. Thus, Nikam and Siddique were sent to Mumbai to represent the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation. 
 
 Mugalikar told TOI that he asked them to go and allowed them to travel in the car. But I am not sure whether they switched the beacon on or not. It will be investigated,” he said. 
 
 Mugalikar said the officers were not allowed to use the beacon. “If they are found guilty, the civic body will take action against them,” he said. 
 
 In the meanwhile,   corporator Raju Vaidya said that the officers should not have used the car with red beacon. “The state government had offered a special fund to the civic body to buy the vehicle so that the municipal chief could use it in case of an emergency. It is not meant for his sub-ordinates or other officers,” he said.
