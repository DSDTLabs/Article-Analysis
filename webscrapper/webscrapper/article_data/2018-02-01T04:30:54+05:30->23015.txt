MUMBAI: Ahead of Thursday’s  , motorists, petrol dealers and experts in the oil and gas industry are hoping the central government passes on reduction in international crude oil prices over the last three years to the common consumers. They want the centre to introduce 40% GST instead of multi-taxing essential commodities.

 According to  , an expert in petrol pricing, the new union government took charge in May 2014 and the new state government in October 2014. He said, “A comparison of retail prices of petrol and diesel in August 2014 and January 27, 2018 proves that both adopted the greedy policy of increasing taxes on petrol and diesel though international crude oil prices continued plummeting.”
 
 Consumers said the benefit of reduction in crude oil prices has, in fact, gone to both the central and state governments who hiked central excise and surcharge on VAT respectively.
