CHENNAI:   has directed a PIL petitioner who sought a direction to remove certain ‘objectionable’ lines from the song ‘Sodakku mela sodakku poduthu’ of ‘Thaana Serndha Kootam’ starring  , to submit the English translation of the song, to decide on the relief. 

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice Abdul Quddhose passed the interim order on the plea moved by P Sathish Kumar, who claims to be the Virugambakkam regional office-bearer of AIADMK. The bench then posted the plea to February 9, for further hearing.
 
 According to the petitioner, the lines – ‘veratti veratti velukka thonuthu, athigaara thimira, veratti veratti velukka thonuthu’ (to banish and bleed authoritative arrogance) – in the song ‘sodakku mela sodakku poduthu’ is defamatory as it portrays politicians and those who are in power in a bad light.
 
 This apart, such lines instigates violence among the people of Tamil Nadu, particularly youngsters to revolt against people in power and politicians, the petitioner alleged. 
 
 Therefore, in a bid to prevent any law and order situation that the song would create in the state, he made a representation to the Chennai commissioner of police to take immediate steps to ban the line from the song.
 
 Since the commissioner has failed to take any action, Sathish Kumar has approached the high court.
