GURUGRAM: A wallet and mobile phones of a former Faridabad   and his two accomplices were   on Tuesday, while   workers protested against the government, alleging “deteriorating law and order” in Gurgaon, police said.

 Members of Haryana Congress took out a rally on Tuesday, slamming the BJP government for “anti-people policies” in the state. The rally began from Aggarwal dharamshala near Sadar Bazar, where Congress leaders addressed the crowd.

 “Somebody stole an iPhone 5 from my pocket during the speech. When I asked Lalit and Amit Bhadana, they told me they were also searching for their mobile phones. Lalit’s wallet was also missing,” Kaushik said in his complaint.
 
 An FIR was registered against unidentified people under Section 379 ( ) of the IPC at City police station. “We are investigating the matter and trying to identify the accused. They will be arrested soon,” said ASI Trilok Chand, who is investigating the case.
 
 “The law and order situation in Gurgaon is deteriorating as we witness cases of rape and dacoity every day. The mobile phones and wallet are being stolen from the meeting place exposes the law and order problem in the city,” said Pankaj Dabar, a local Congress leader.
