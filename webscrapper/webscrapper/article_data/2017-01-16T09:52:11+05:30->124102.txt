BAREILLY: Nida Khan, former wife of   seminary head’s nephew, has now written to Union minister   for help.
 
  In her letter to Swaraj, Nida narrated her ordeal to the minister. She said that due to pressure of the clerical family, police officers are not helping her. “Sheeran Raza Khan had threatened to throw acid on my face and he has still not returned things which my family had given him in dowry. When I told police officers about Sheeran’s warning, his family tried to implicate my father and brother in a fake rape case. Sheeran and his family are levelling fake allegations against me and my family,” the letter stated.
  
  She has asked for a   inquiry in the case. “Sheeran’s family is very powerful and is trying to lodge fake cases against my family to build pressure on me. I want CBI probe in the matter,” she said.
  
  Nida was divorced by  , nephew of the seminary head Subhan Raza Khan.
  
  In June last year, Nida had moved court demanding an FIR against her husband and in-laws for allegedly assaulting her and causing a miscarriage. Police in their final report gave a clean chit to the accused, after the couple was divorced. However, Nida claimed that she was not given a divorce in her presence and the family used triple talaq to dodge the criminal case. She again moved court against the final report of the police.
