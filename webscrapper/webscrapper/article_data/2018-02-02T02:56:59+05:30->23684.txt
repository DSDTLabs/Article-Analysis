MUMBAI: A relative of terror accused Abu   has deposed in the November 26, 2008 Mumbai attack case and identified his voice in an audio clip.

 The prosecution said that the 28-minute recording was of conversations between a control room in Pakistan from where a handler (alleged to be Jundal) was relaying instructions to terrorists in the midst of the terror attack.
 
 During the deposition on Thursday, the relative told the court that he had known Jundal since their childhood. He also submitted that the words used in the audio clip like ‘prashasan’ and ‘yuvak’ were peculiar. The witness also said that even the pronunciation of words used by the man who he identified as Jundal were peculiar and similar to those of people hailing from his home town Beed. The witness submitted that it was the same recording played to him by the investigating agency at the time of recording his statement on October 6, 2012. The defence began cross-examining the witness and pointed out to alleged omissions between the audio clips and its actual transcripts. The cross-examination will continue on Friday. On Wednesday, the relative told the court that Jundal had given him Saudi currency to hand over to an accused in the   arms haul case.
 
 This is the second leg of the trial. In the first part, terrorist   was tried and found guilty. He was hanged in 2012.
