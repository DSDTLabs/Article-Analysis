THANE: The   ( ) is planning an aerial surveillance of stretches occupied by hawkers by using drone- installed cameras to keep a track of their movements and hideouts during raids.

 Several arterial stretches, including the railway station premises at Thane and Mumbra, Majiwada, Wagle Estate and Kalwa Naka witness massive traffic congestion and inconvenience to pedestrians, especially during peak hours due to hawkers who encroach upon the areas. Repeated attempts by civic officials to raid these places have proved futile as the hawkers are reportedly alerted by conniving civic staff following which they manage to vanish and hide before the team arrives. 
 
 According to the plan, each of the 10 civic wards will be equipped with a   camera that will not only survey the dense stretches but also record presence of hawkers in the area to monitor where they stock their wares during raids. The footage would be saved for a certain period of time. Accordingly, the civic teams equipped with the data will be able to conduct timely raids and also depute flying squad staff at designated spots to ensure these hawkers do not escape. 
 
 The TMC plans to start a pilot project on the premises of Thane railway station. 
 
  "The plan has been formulated to keep busy junctions and city stretches free of encroachments. Drone cameras will be used to keep track record movement of hawkers, their hideouts to ensure they don't escape action,‚Äù said municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal.
