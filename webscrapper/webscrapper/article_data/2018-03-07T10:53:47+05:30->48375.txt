MEERUT: Chaos broke out at Meerut’s   road over installation of a loudspeaker at a madrassa there on Tuesday. Two communities clashed and raised slogans against each other’s faiths. The brawl continued even after police reached the spot, following which they were forced to use lathi charge to contain the situation. The loudspeaker was later removed and police deployed at the spot to prevent any communal violence.
 
  Speaking to TOI,  , station house officer of Rohta police station said, “The loudspeaker has been removed from the madrassa and police force has been deployed to ensure that no communal incident is reported from there. The law and order situation at the spot is under control and the matter has been solved by removing the loudspeaker at the madrassa, for which no permission had been taken.”
  
  Some people from one of the warring communities had installed a loudspeaker at the madrassa in Atta Chindauri area on Meerut’s Rohta road on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. People living close by were woken up by its sound in the morning and started protesting, saying it was against the law. The Uttar Pradesh government had, in January this year, directed that illegal loudspeakers (those installed without permission) at shrines be removed.
