In 2015, Harsh Chhaya played a key role in Arindam Sil’s Har Har Byomkesh. Though the actor’s relationship with Kolkata goes back many years, on that trip, he made many friends. Among them was  , composer of the Byomkesh film. Now, three years later, when Harsh is set to wield the megaphone, it’s Bickram who is scoring for his debut directorial, Khajoor Pe Atke.

 Sharing the good news with us, Bickram said, “Harsh was fascinated by the score of Har Har Byomkesh. This time around, he asked Arindam if I would be interested in his Hindi film and my answer was yes. I have done the entire album that includes four songs and the background score.” The duo spent a couple of months working on the score and the sound that has emerged out of the collaboration is satisfying for Bickram. “Every time I work on a Hindi project, I try to use our local talents. So, there’s a duet by Ujjaini and Timir Biswas. It’s called Aona dekha and the lyrics are by Harsh. The second song, Nachenge verandah mein, is a peppy number sung by  . He has sung for Baahubali: The Beginning and  , among many other films. The words are written by Kumar of Baby doll and Chittiyaan kalaiyaan fame. Then there’s an item song, Gupchup, sung by Kalpana Patowary,” explained Bickram.
 
 The composer made an unusual choice for his fourth number, a tragi-comic song, Dhokha. “The song required a lot of abhinay and Harsh rendered it so well that I retained it. Fact is, both of us share similar sensibilities and the zone that I got into wouldn’t have been possible without Harsh’s support. We spent a lot of time together and it’s reflecting in the music,” he said. Khajoor Pe Atke is an out-and-out comedy starring Vinay Pathak, Manoj Pahwa, Alka Amin, Seema Bhargava and Sanah Kapoor, sister of  , among others. “After long, the audience will be rolling on the floor with laughter,” said Bickram.
