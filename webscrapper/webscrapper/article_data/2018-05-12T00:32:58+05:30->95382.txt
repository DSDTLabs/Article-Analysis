New Delhi: The   would have moved out of the house on Saturday. Chedi Lal, once a wealthy man with eight houses, was now left with just one. And that too his   Santosh wanted to take over and often fought with them for it. 

 Lal and his wife Lakshmi had six children. They lost three children to TB and kidney malfunction. But to get their chidren treated, the couple had to sell off one house after another. “My parents were very selfless. They kept selling off the houses for the treatment of my siblings. Despite being so aged, they took care of Santosh like he was their baby. Santosh would often thrash them and break things inside the house, but my parents patiently made him understand. He paid them well by setting them on fire,” said Jyoti, the couple’s daughter. 
 
 She said police had to be called on a few occasions, but Santosh would always apologise and all would be forgiven, also because he was  . “I wish they had taken some action against him. If they had, they would be alive today,” Jyoti said. 
 
 Lal’s sister Savita said she had seen her brother and sister-in-law suffer for a long time and had promised to take them to her house. “As I was leaving for their house on Friday, I received a call from the police about the fire,” she said. 
 
 “I saw him beat up his mother a week ago. He had shouted that he will burn her alive. I strongly feel he is the one who set the house on fire,” said a neighbour.
