AHMEDABAD: For the last seven months, the world’s largest digital repository on Mahatma Gandhi — The   — is without an editor. This post has been lying vacant since August last year. It was in September 2013 that the Union ministry of culture had launched this one-stop website for all scholars who wanted to research on   and his essential works. The website was launched by former Prime Minister   and an exclusive grant of Rs 7.5 crore was provided for the digital archives. 

 The Sabarmati Ashram is the largest repository of Gandhiji’s original writings and has a photo archive of over 7,000 images of Gandhiji and his associates. It also has a substantial library of over 45,000 books on and about Gandhiji and the Indian National Movement. The portal was conceptualised around The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (CWMG). It first placed the collected works in three languages — English 100 volumes, Hindi 97 volumes and Gujarati 82 volumes. These volumes are interlinked to provide easy movement from one text and language to the other.
 
 Besides the Ashram’s own collection, the portal has in the last four years have made several additions including the complete Gandhi papers from the National Archives, MJ Library collection and several other private collections donated to the Ashram. “The trustees had met twice for appointing an editor for the portal, but are yet to take a decision,” said a senior official of the Ashram. Without a functional editor and a Gandhian scholar, choosing which texts should be uploaded and in what order is a problem, claim officials.
