KOLKATA:   operating out of Kolkata have been forced to   with its   partner unable to   to several items, including most of the vegetarian fare.

 “Several popular items have been out of stock for weeks. There is no clarity yet on when supplies will resume. We apologise for the inconvenience,” is what the staff at the McD outlet at Homeland Mall tells customers ordering items that are currently unavailable.
 
 
 Problems in raw material supply had forced outlets to shut down several times in the past couple of months. “The challenges concerning raw material supply network continues. We were hoping it would get sorted out soon but it doesn’t look like that now,” an employee at one of the outlets told TOI.
 
 The five McD outlets in Kolkata and one in Howrah had downed shutters before Christmas after Radhakrishna Foodland Pvt Ltd, the authorised supplier, discontinued supply after sales plummeted in the wake of growing uncertainty over the future of these outlets. One of them, the flagship restaurant at Park Street, has since shut down permanently following a dispute in property lease.
 
 The Vikram Bakshi-owned CPRL is locked in an acrimonious battle with the American quick service restaurant giant with the latter barring CPRL from using the brand, trademark and other intellectual properties in September.
 
 The frequent shutdowns had affected footfalls. Now, the depleted menu is further hampering sales. With so many veg items off the menu, vegetarians that traditionally comprise a big chunk of customers in Kolkata are now walking into other quick service restaurants, resulting in sales slide.
 
 Drop in sales is also hurting mall managements that had entered into long-term lease with CPRL. The pacts were skewed heavily towards revenue sharing and had very low rentals. With revenues now down, mall managements that once flaunted the McD outlets to attract other retailers are now in an embarrassing situation.
