NAVI MUMBAI: Many may be looking forward to the colourful festival of   that is just around the corner. But for   and strays, the occasion is far from happy, say pet owners and animal lovers. From being doused in colour by children to having colour thrown in their eyes, keeping them safe is no easy task. 

 Animal activists and vets agree that protecting them from miscreants is the only option. Some activists even take care of strays until the festival is over. 
 
 Kharghar resident Ashwini Karandikar Gadoo cares for five dogs and one cat during Holi celebrations. Initially, there used to be fights between the residents over caring for strays, said Gadoo, but now she prefers to take care of the animals herself.
 
 “Educating children about the dangers of   goes a long way in preventing any untoward incidents. Once children understand the problems, they ensure that adults don’t indulge in such acts,” she said. In the past, she has seen dogs and cats suffer from skin infections and even blindness. “Lead present in colours is not just harmful for children but animals also. The difference is animals suffer in silence,” she said.
 
 Dr  , a local vet says that awareness has reduced the number of pet injury cases, but they continue to occur. “Miscreants consider it fun to pick on strays and douse them with colour or rub their faces with toxic substances,” he said.
 
 Once the festival is over, animal lovers bring in the strays suffering from a rash or a skin infection. “Often the dog gets blind with excess colour rubbed on its face. As far as possible, I tell my patients to avoid harming these animals.” Dr Dhawale added.
 
 Animal lover Nikita Pujari from Vashi says children often don't understand the harm caused and parents do little to educate them. “Schools should also pitch in and teaching children to respect and care for unwanted animals,” she said.
