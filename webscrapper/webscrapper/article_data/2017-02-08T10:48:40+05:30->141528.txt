THRISSUR: A section of students of the   (NCERC) at Pambady here on Tuesday said they would resist the management's attempts to reopen the college without meeting their demands to constitute a PTA and students' union in the college. 

 The students announced this at a press conference here following reports that the   was trying to reopen the pharmacy college on the campus on Wednesday. 
 
 The college was closed about a month ago following the suicide of Jishnu Pranoy, an engineering student, in the backdrop of alleged harassment by the college management.
 
 The students alleged that the management was trying to scuttle the investigation using its clout. Police have so far not made any arrests despite being given several telling evidences. There were blood stains on the walls of the bathroom where Jishnu was found dead. But the management had washed off those stains, said Nissar Ahmed, one of the four students who addressed the press meet.
 
 "We had submitted a detailed memorandum to chief minister   but no significant action has been taken by the government so far," said Jestin Job, another student.
 
 The parents are being threatened with dire consequences regarding the future of their children. They are being individually called to forces their wards to accept the terms set by the management, alleged Vishnu R Kumar, another student.
 
 The students are also demanding the removal of the vice principal, Sakthivel, the teacher C P Praveen, who was the invigilator in the examination hall where Jishnu had allegedly copied, and Sanjit Viswanathan, the PRO.
 
 Nehru College of Pharmacy principal B Sreedareen said the classes will be resumed on Wednesday. He claimed that a decision to this effect was taken at a PTA meeting held on Tuesday. However, the students said the management had only selectively invited the parents to the PTA meeting.
