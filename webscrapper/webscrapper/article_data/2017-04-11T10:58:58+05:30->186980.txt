 CHANDIGARH: The city's booze stock has thinned and you have a fat chance of finding beer.
 
 The  's roadsafety verdict has forced liquor companies to shut their warehouses that were within 500 metres of the national and state highways. Nearly 10 storages of beer and 11 of liquor are in the process of relocating. Yet another year, the UT excise and taxation department is late to fix the ex-distillery price ( ) of liquor for traders, and alcohol cannot be sold until then.
 
 The department issues vendors permits for lifting their quarterly quota of liquor from the warehouses of different companies. As these places are shut, there are no permits since the new liquor policy came into force on April 7. 
 
 Old liquor traders survive on last year's leftover quota, while the new traders who bought outlets in the last auction are yet to start business. The city has 53 liquor shops, of which beer is out of stock in about 50%. Making most of the opportunity, the remaining sellers have jacked up the prices.
 
 Neeraj Chawala, who bought a liquor outlet each in Sector 34 and 37 in the last auction, said he had taken heavy losses, “as I am unable to open the shops because liquor is unavailable“. 
 
 Darshan Singh Kler, who made the highest bid of Rs 9.51 crore (against a reserve price of Rs 4.44 crore) for a liquor shop in Sector 42, said he was making do with leftover quota to supply his four outlets.
 
  president Satya Pal blamed the shortage on the excise department's inability to issue permits to liquor traders.“An average of 400 bottles a day are sold at each shop,“ he said. 
 
 UT assistant excise and taxation commissioner (AETC)   confirmed that his office was in the process of fixing the EDP. He declined to comment on when the companies will relocate their warehouses.
