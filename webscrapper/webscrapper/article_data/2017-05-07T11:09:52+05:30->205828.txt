HYDERABAD: With   over the use of EVMs in the country  , the   (TRS) has made its stance clear. The party is all for the use of EVMs but at the same time wants a provision made for Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT). 

 The   of India (ECI) has called for a meeting with all political parties in New Delhi on May 12. The meeting was called in the wake of doubts being expressed about the functioning of EVMs and questions about the possibility of them being hacked to favor a particular party.
 
 "We are not against EVMs. But we favour the use of VVPAT also," senior TRS leader and Karimnagar MP B   told TOI. Vinod Kumar said since there are questions being raised about the reliability of EVMs, it would only be appropriate for the EC to give clarity.
 
 In the aftermath of the UP elections which brought the BJP to power, the Congress, BSP and AAP had alleged tampering of EVMs. The EC had categorically stated that tampering of EVMs was not possible. It also threw a challenge to anyone who wanted to prove that it was possible and show that it can be hacked.
 
 The TRS stand on EVMs now is different from what it had earlier expressed. In 2010, the party had written to the Election Commission asking that ballot papers be used instead of EVMs in some bypolls. The EC rejected the plea. The request was made by the TRS in connection with bypolls for 12 assembly seats. The party at one point had also threatened to approach the court against the use of EVMs.
