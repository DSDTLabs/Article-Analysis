As the Kannada film   prepares to hit theatres today, it is an emotional moment for the team. It is, after all, a project that was driven by passion, but hit a roadblock after a tragic accident on the set that cost the lives of two actors, which is now being brought to audiences. “Our film is about the importance of the jungle and wildlife and it is only apt that we extend that to our lives as well. Today, we will plant saplings in memory of   and   V, and exhort everyone else to do so,” says director  .

 Produced by   and the late Anil Kumar V for KPS Combines, Maasti Gudi brings together Nagashekar, who is known for bringing love stories to the screen, and action star Duniya  . The result, says the filmmaker, is a thriller with romance at its core. “Maasti Gudi will be an experience for audiences at many levels. For starters, the theme — about the importance of the wild — will pique everyone’s interest, as will Vijay’s varied looks, the two ladies —Amulya and   — and the rest of the cast. Given that much of the film has been shot in actual jungles, audiences will literally be transported into the deep wilderness. And all this is along with a pertinent social message,” says Nagashekar.
