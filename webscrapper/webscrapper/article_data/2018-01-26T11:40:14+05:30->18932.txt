A sly reference to the 'Padmaavat' controversy was made during a session titled 'Ghatotkacha: Master of Illusions' when JLF 2018 festival director, author   spoke about mythological characters whose stories need to be retold.

 "Even today, people think it's acceptable to cut off someone's nose," said Gokhale. Hinting at the   elements, she said it reminded her that the narrative of Surpanakha-a demoness whose nose was chopped off by Lakshmana-could do with a retelling.
 
 At this jolly session hosted by  , managing director of Teamwork Arts which organises the festival, Gokhale's granddaughter shyly unveiled her naani's book, 'Lost In Time: Ghatotkacha and the Game of Illusions', which is about a young boy transported via a wormhole to the days of Mahabharata. It was this granddaughter's cackling laughter over a TV character named   that made Gokhale call her protagonist Chintamani.
 
 In this book, illustrated by artist Ujan Dutta, Chintamani meets the gentle giant and master of illusion, Ghatotkacha, with whom the boy develops an unlikely friendship involving strange innovations such as a football made of intertwined snakes which Gokhale likes to call 'rakshas technology'.
 
 It is no coincidence that instead of appearing huge, red-eyed and evil, Ghatotkacha, a demon, looks svelte and handsome, boasting of the same gentle eyes as its illustrator. As a boy who grew up in Gurgaon, illustrator Dutta identified with the young boy's story and wanted to give him the company of a "friendly giant" whose face reflected empathy. At one point, the creators considered making Ghatotkacha bald but then decided to give him a top knot instead. "I don't believe in baddies," said Gokhale, when asked about the absence of villains in her book. In fact, for Gokhale-who feels kids aged 10 and 11 have a deep seated, unexpressed fear of death-the book is a way of reassuring young readers that "nothing really ever dies".
