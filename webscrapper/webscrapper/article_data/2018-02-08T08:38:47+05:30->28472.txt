HYDERABAD: There’s some good and bad news for Metro users. While Metro Rail operations in the city are all set for a ramp-up with an increase in frequency of trains by April, fares do not look like they will come down any time soon.

 Municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) minister   on Wednesday ruled out any reduction in fares as they were on par with the tariffs of RTC AC buses plying in the city.
 
 Afoundation stone for another extra kilometer of Metro rail on the   stretch would also be laid soon. Initially, the route was conceived only from Nagole to Hi-Tec City but later the plan was modified to extend it by another kilometer to Raidurg.
 
 Interacting with media,   said, “At least for the next two years, taxes will not be increased in new municipalities that were planned. This is a directive from chief minister  .”
 
 The minister said real estate prices in the city had stabilised, primarily because of the top priority accorded to the law and order situation in the city and state by the government. “It is because of the peaceful atmosphere that is prevailing here that several Bengaluru-based construction companies have headed to the city,” he said, pointing out that 7.5 million sft of office space had already been created in the city.
 
 Asked about the delimitation of Assembly constituencies in Telangana, he expressed bewilderment over the Centre shying away from taking a decision, when it was provided for in the Reorganisation Act for both AP and Telangana. “The BJP should answer why it is not being done. In any case, TRS is confident, poll outcome will be in its favour,” he said.
 
 “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is only 65. He is in perfect health. And he will rule for another 10-15 years,” he said. KTR also said the TRS cadre was swelling, with huge enrolments seen in the party, which would be taking up cadre training soon.
