NEW DELHI: That something unusual was in the offing was clear when Justice J  , who arrived at 10.35 am in court no. 2 to hear cases listed before him, said he had an important task and asked lawyers not to mention cases that were not urgent as he had to finish off the board.

 Justice Chelameswar along with Justices  ,   and  , completed the hearing of cases listed before them before noon and left the court premises. As news spread of plans for a presser journalists rushed to Justice Chelameswarâ€™s residence where the briefing was to be held at 12:15 pm.
 
 Minutes before the presser, Chief Justice   too cut short court proceedings to take a break till 2 pm, perhaps to watch the live telecast of the presser in which the top judges raised serious objections on his way of functioning in assigning the cases to the various benches. He assured lawyers the bench will assemble at 2 to hear remaining cases.
 
 The four judges seemed a tad uncomfortable at the barrage of questions from journalists. They rose after addressing the media for around 10 minutes. As they moved out, many flower pots got damaged in the rush. The journalists again started following Justice Chelameswar when he came out after 20 minutes. He requested them with folded hands to leave him for the day.
