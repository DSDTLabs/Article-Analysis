HYDERABAD: Justice Shameem Akther of Hyderabad High Court on Wednesday dismissed a petition filed by   chairman and former   chief N   who was seeking exemption from court appearances before an   in the city.

 The case pertains to the India Cements episode in the YS Jaganmohan Reddy disproportionate assets case. The facility of obtaining exemption under Section 205 of CrPC is applicable only at magistrate courts and not before courts headed by sessions judges. Since the ED court is being headed by a sessions judge, the power to invoke Section 205 is not available. The judge agreed with ED counsel   that the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is a special enactment and cannot be equated with CBI cases.
