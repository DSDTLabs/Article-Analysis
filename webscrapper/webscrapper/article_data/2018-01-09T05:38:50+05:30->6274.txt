HUBBALLI (KARNATAKA): Relatives of a 23-year-old road accident victim declared dead by doctors at a hospital claimed he was "alive in the mortuary freezer for six hours". Shocked to see the "dead body" stirring while they were at   (KIMS), the family rushed   to a private hospital, where he was declared dead again, they said. They allege the staff at KIMS didn't properly ascertain whether Mule was alive, costing him precious treatment time.
