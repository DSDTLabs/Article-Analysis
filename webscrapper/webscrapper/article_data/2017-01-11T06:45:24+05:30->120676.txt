NEW DELHI: The   expressed displeasure on Tuesday over the Centre’s “slow” handling of sensitive cases in the highest court and rapped it for seeking “adjournment in almost every case”.

 There was a string of cases in the morning session in which a bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrchud found the Centre seeking more time, saying it was unprepared.
 
 In fact, this has been the trend in the Supreme Court, where the central agency under the law ministry handles the distribution of cases among law officers. Most of these officers get the files of cases listed for hearing in the   late in the day, leaving them very little time to prepare their arguments. Many times, the law officers remain unaware of filing of reply affidavits in a case, hindering their efforts to place the facts of the case properly . In fact, the government started on a wrong foot be fore the CJI on January 4, when the first case listed before the bench headed by Justice Khehar had to be adjourned, as the solicitor general was not prepared with the case. The SG had to apologise profusely on that day , as he had not been briefed properly about the case relating to the Noida-Agra expressway .
 
 The law officers often complain about poor briefing by panel lawyers. On Tuesday , the CJI said what had been felt by many for years, yet the situation remains the same in the apex court.
 
 Appearing for the Narmada Control Authority and Madhya Pradesh government, additional solicitors general Tushar Mehta and P S Patwalia sought adjournment of hearing seeking to file latest status report. The court asked: “You were aware of the case coming up for hearing today . Why did you not prepare the status report?“ The court had no option but to adjourn the case till January 19.
