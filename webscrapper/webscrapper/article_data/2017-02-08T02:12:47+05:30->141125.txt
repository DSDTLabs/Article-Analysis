NEW DELHI:   is preparing for its most circuitous route where a distance that should be covered in less than five hours will take about seven hours. 

  The airline is preparing for flights on the   and the announcement could be made during Prime Minister Modi's expected visit to Israel later this year. 
 
  "Saudi Arabia does not allow planes to fly to Israel from over its airspace. So AI is drawing up a circuitous route to avoid overflying countries that have such restrictions for Israel-bound planes," said a source. 
 
  Israel is not recognised by a majority of the Islamic and Gulf countries that lie between it and India. At present Israel's El Al Airlines flies between Tel Aviv and Mumbai . 
 
  The flying time between these two cities should be less than 5 hours but El Al can't overfly some countries on direct flight path like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan due to which it has to take a longer route. 
 
  For instance, the El Al flight taking off from Tel Aviv for Mumbai has to go to the southern tip of the country, fly over Red Sea completely avoiding Saudi and then turn east from the "horn of Africa" that juts into the   straight to its destination. As a result, the distance of 4,057 km between Mumbai and Tel Aviv is covered in eight hours - almost the time taken to fly the 6,700-km-apart Delhi and London. 
 
  AI may have an advantage as it plans to take fly its   787 Dreamliner the regular straight route up to Saudi and then take a detour near Red Sea to enter Israel as it cannot enter the country directly from Saudi. As a result, its flying time will be a little less than El Al. AI many years ago used to operate the Airbus A-310 to Israel but had discontinued the route which could now restart later this year.
