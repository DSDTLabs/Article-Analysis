PATNA: One Utsav Kumar (15), a Class VIII student of a noted private city school, was murdered and his body was dumped on the railway tracks between Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Gulzarbagh station in Patna on Monday.

 Utsav’s father Aditya Kumar, a businessman of Chitragupta Nagar area, lodged an FIR with the Patna junction government rail police (GRP) against unknown persons.
 
 Patna GRP SHO Pramod Kumar suspected love affair as the reason behind the teen’s murder. “There were multiple injuries on Utsav’s head indicating that he was attacked with some heavy object. Preliminary investigations indicate that Utsav was killed somewhere else and his body was dumped on the tracks,” he said.
 
 Utsav had left his home at around 10.30am on Monday telling his parents that he was going to visit the market. “At noon, his parents called him on his cellphone and Utsav said he would return within ten minutes. When he did not return, Utsav’s parents tried to contact himat 12.27pm, but the call was unanswered,” the SHO said.
 
 He said at 1.25pm, Utsav’s parents again called him and this time someone else attended the call and informed him that the cellphone was lying near a body found on the railway tracks.
 
 “Utsav was rushed to a private hospital but he was declared brought dead. His parents took his body home and informed the police in the evening,” he said.
 
 The SHO said Utsav used to talk to a girl and investigations were on to know who else had met him after he left his home. “Police are awaiting Utsav’s cellphone call detail records (CDR) and post mortem report for further investigation,” he said.
