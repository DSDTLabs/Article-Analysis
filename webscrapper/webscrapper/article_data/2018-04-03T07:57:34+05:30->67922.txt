LUCKNOW: Joining ranks with   in slamming the Centre for its failure to address the concerns of dalits over the SC ruling, SP chief   said the government should have held talks with dalits to clarify its stand on the issue. But the Centre failed to do so and this has further strengthened the perception that the government was not concerned about dalits. 

 "  has provided for the rights of dalits and we have to respect that. It is a pity that people have to resort to agitations to be heard,"   said, adding that no one can deprive the dalits of their rights. 
 
 "We are committed towards the uplift of dalits and will always stand by them in their peaceful protests," he said with an appeal to protesters to exercise control.
