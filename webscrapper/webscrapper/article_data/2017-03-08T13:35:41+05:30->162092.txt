NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday, while refusing any relief, ordered real estate mogul   to surrender on Thursday in connection with the   tragedy case.

 Earlier this week, the apex court fixed Ansal's plea seeking modification of its review order on parity in connection with the case for March 8.
 
 Ansal has in his plea requested to be treated at par with his elder brother Sushil, who was allowed to skip prison citing old age and ill-health.
 
 Senior advocate K T S Tulsi, appearing for the   (AVUT) led by Neelam Krishnamoorthy, had opposed the plea, saying the review pleas of the   and the association have already been decided and "there cannot be a review of the review judgement".
 
 Gopal has sought relief that he should not be asked to serve one-year jail term like his elder brother   in the case of 1997 fire tragedy in which 59 people were killed.
 
 A bench, in a 2:1 majority verdict on February 9, had granted relief to 76-year-old Sushil Ansal, prime accused in the Uphaar case, considering his "advanced age-related complications" by awarding him the jail term already undergone. Revisiting its earlier ruling in 2015, the apex court had asked younger sibling Gopal to surrender in four weeks to serve the remainder of his one-year jail term in the 20-year-old case. 
 
 59 persons died of asphyxia and over 100 others were injured after a fire broke out in the 
  cinema during the screening of Hindi movie 'Border' in June 1997.
