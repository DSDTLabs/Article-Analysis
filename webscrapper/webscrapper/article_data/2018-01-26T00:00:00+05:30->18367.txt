After impressing with his short film, Chowkabara, director   is all geared up to do the same with his first feature film — Morning Star Pictures’  , which is being released by KRG Studios — that hits screens today. Unlike what one would expect, one can only sense calm and confidence in Raghu’s voice, even though we spoke to him just a day before the release. And that speaks volumes of what one can expect from the film. “Churikatte is a good Kannada film, with a new story. There have been many stories about the forest, but this one is packed with thrilling elements that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I believe that cinema is an experience; a journey that people go on. When watching Churikatte, I am certain that the audience will forget their everyday lives and stress, and feel that they are actually in Malnad (where the movie is set) along with the film’s characters,” says Raghu.
The performances are the other strong points of the film. “Praveen (Tej) hasn’t played the character like this before and Prerna (Kambam) is a very promising actor. Achyut Kumar, Balaji Manohar, Dattanna, Sharat Lohitashwa, Pramod Shetty, Vivek Simha and Manjunath Hegde are all to look out for. The story is such that no one’s role is small — they all have important, memorable roles,” says Raghu. Add to this five situational songs that take the story forward and cinematography that will transport you to another place, and you have a complete package. No wonder then that KRG Studios is backing the film. 
 “Having the film release through such a big banner is a big strength for us. They have worked hard for our film and I am very happy about this association,” says Raghu, signing off.
