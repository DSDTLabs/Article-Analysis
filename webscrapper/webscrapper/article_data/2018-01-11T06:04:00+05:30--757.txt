Yavatmal: The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Yavatmal police are set to file a 10,000-page chargesheet before the special district court on January 15 against Maitreya Planters and Structure Private Company in the multi-crore cheating case.

 Police sources said the company launched its branch in Yavatmal in 2007 and collected over Rs 10.52 crore from 5,225 225 depositors of Yavatmal by offering lucrative returns and incentives. 
 
 However, the company failed to fulfil its promises. Thereafter, a large number of depositors and agents lodged complaints against the company’s officials at various police stations.
 
 Offences under sections 420 and 406 of IPC and Maharashtra Protection of Depositors Act, 1999, have been registered against the company’s managing director Varsha Madhusudan Satpalkar, director Janardhan Arvind Parulekar, both residents of Vasai in Palghar district, and Yavataal branch manager Sanjay Dahiskar. All of them have been arrested.
 
 District SP M Rajkumar handed over the investigation to PI Dilip Wadgaonkar of EOW. During investigation, police identified properties worth Rs48 crore of the company in Nashik, Palghar, Dhule and Jalgaon and seized them.
 
 “The EOW is entrusted with the investigation of a dozen such fraudulent companies and societies, which are in progress,” said sub-inspector Premdas Ade.
