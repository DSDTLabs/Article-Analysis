MANDYA: The   ( ) appears to be groping in the dark after the sudden death of its chief  , and it is unlikely that the vacuum created by his death would be filled up soon.

 The morale in the KRRS is at an all-time low, as the members have suddenly lost their unchallenged leader. Once, it was a cadre-based organization led by a collective leadership. But for the past couple of years, KRRS has been heavily dependent on Puttannaiah, who emerged as the sole leader.
 
 With assembly elections around the corner, Puttannaiah’s sudden absence is baffling KRRS office-bearers. Many brainstorming meetings of the office-bearers to find an able leader and how to steer the organization have so far failed to find any concrete and viable solutions. Efforts to find a successor to KRRS is likely to be speeded up after the 11th day ceremony on Wednesday. In this fluid situation, rumours of Puttannaiah’s son   contesting the assembly poll from Melukote as the KRRS candidate are spreading thick and fast. There is also speculation that chief minister   reportedly expressed his desire to support his wife Sunita, if she wants to enter the poll fray.
