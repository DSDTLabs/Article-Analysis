MALDA: A day after a tribal agitation rocked  , the area remained on the boil with hundreds of traders hitting the streets in protest against vandalism by the agitators who allegedly set cars ablaze and ransacked shops. Traders, incidentally, had called an indefinite strike on Friday itself. The traders, who allegedly suffered losses in crores, refused to open shops without compensation and security assurance. 

 Though it was supposed to be only a traders’ strike, Raiganj observed a total ‘bandh’ on Saturday. Roads in different parts of the town were blocked with agitators setting tyres of plying vehicles on fire. They also clashed with policemen at several places.   SP   himself faced the traders’ wrath when he tried to lift a blockade. The traders complained: “Where was police yesterday (Friday) when our shops were gutted?”
 
 Later, a district   delegation met sub-divisional officer Pradip Das. After an hour-long meeting, chamber secretary   said, “We are not satisfied. We want to meet the SP.” They have not assured whether the strike would be withdrawn.
 
 On Friday, the tribals — led by nine outfits — turned violent while agitating to demand arrest of those accused of raping two tribal girls. The agitators were armed with bows and arrows, spears, rods, sticks. They blocked the NH-34 for at least four hours till 6pm, which the lifted only after the additional district magistrate assured he would consider their demand. No one has been arrested for Friday’s violence yet. Rathod said, “We have identified some of the culprits. Specific cases would be started soon.”
