There’s no denying the fact that how stylish and fashion forward   was during her maternity phase. From her slit gowns to red carpet appearances, she broke the internet every time! And now, post her pregnancy, she has been the new sensation again. 

 
 
 
 From her miraculous weight loss to her glowing skin, Kareena is ruling her post pregnancy game too. Recently for a party, she was spotted wearing something basic, until she turned around and showed off her sexy back. She was spotted wearing a backless top with jogger like pants. Kareena slayed this all-black look with a sling back from Saint Laurent and glittery strap heels. 
 
  
  
 
 Her sexy avatar grabbed everyone's attention with her one turn. And seems like even her husband Saif Ali Khan couldn’t keep his eyes off her. Well, we don't blame him!
