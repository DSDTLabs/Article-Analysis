VADODARA: On March 23 evening , a   in   will narrate its story and ‘speak’ about how it feels neglected in the fast-urbanizing cities. 

 A city-based artist has come up with an innovative idea for bringing to fore the condition of this 500-year-old stepwell also known as ‘Vidyadhar Vaav’. Kakoli Sen will be staging a light and sound show at the step-well to describe its history and present condition.

The vaav will talk about how it came into being, the advantages it offered and its experiences,” Sen told TOI. The show will then highlight the dilapidated condition of the vaav and how it can be saved. 
 
 “The idea is to spread awareness about such stepwells whose concept areas relevant in contemporary times when we are facing water crisis,” Sen said. She has invited bureaucrats and some eminent citizens for the show called ‘The Soul of Vaav’. 
 
 “It is not just the government that has to care. Even people can conserve such vaavs at their own level by not throwing garbage in them.,” said Sen who is recipient of senior fellowship of   for conducting research on step-wells in Gujarat. 
 
 It is considered as the oldest and most beautiful step-wells of Sultan Mehmud Begada’s time in 16th century. The brick and stone vav is in east-west direction and goes seven storeys below ground level. The second storey has leaf patterns and magnificent sculptures.
