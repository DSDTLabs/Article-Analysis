AURANGABAD:   at the   on Wednesday, a day after TOI published a story about the   over  .

 The centres, built by the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) at a cost of Rs 125 crore, had lost power connection for having failed to clear the bills. 
 
 “Power supply to   centre was snapped on Tuesday for non-payment of Rs 16.64 lakh, while it was snapped at Ellora centre a few days ago to recover dues of Rs 18.48 lakh, MSEDCL officials said.
 
 Om Prakash Bakoria, joint managing director of MSEDCL, told TOI that he had a talk with the MTDC managing director who promised him that all the electricity dues would be cleared by August 15. 
 
 “Since the promise was made by the MTDC managing director himself that all the dues of the centres would be cleared within a month, we immediately ordered reconnection of the high tension power supply line,” said Bakoria.
 
 Annasaheb Shinde, senior regional manager of MTDC, said these developments took place following the TOI report. “I had already requested the MSEDCL not to disconnect power supply as it might affect the functioning of the visitors’ centres.”
 
 “The centres, which have replicas of the two caves, have been built with an aim to reduce the burden on the original place and allow curious tourists to take a closer look at the paintings and sculptures,” he said. 
 
 “The MTDC welcomes the electricity firm’s gesture and we will clear the dues soon after receiving government assistance which we have sought earlier in March,” said Shinde.
