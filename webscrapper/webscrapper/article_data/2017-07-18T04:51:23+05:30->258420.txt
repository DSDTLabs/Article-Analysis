NEW DELHI: The   directed the   on Monday to form a panel of eminent persons to take over the function of the oversight committee headed by former Chief Justice of India R M   for regulation of medical education and profession in the country.

 Although the   (MCI) is the apex body to regulate medical education, the apex court had in May last year appointed the oversight committee saying MCI had been unprofessional in discharging its duties properly. As the Justice Lodha committee completed its one-year tenure, a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice   asked the Centre to appoint a panel to replace the committee.
 
 The bench, also comprising justices J Chelameswar, R K Agrawal, D Y Chandrachud and S Abdul Nazeer, asked the Centre to take a decision forthwith and brief it on Tuesday about the members who would be part of the committee.
 
 The Centre told the bench that it was planning to set up a five-member panel consisting special director general of health services, deputy and additional director general of medical education and two doctors. But the constitution of the committee was strongly opposed by various medical colleges which wanted that independent persons and not government officials be appointed as members.
 
 Solicitor general Ranjit Kumar and additional solicitor general Maninder Singhtold the bench that the government would place the names before the court for its approval. “You will have to come up with a mechanism to deal with grievances of medical colleges. And if the government does not do it, we will have to do it,” the bench said and posted the case for Tuesday. The apex court had appointed the Lodha panel to oversee MCI because the regulator was often accused of indulging in corrupt practices.
