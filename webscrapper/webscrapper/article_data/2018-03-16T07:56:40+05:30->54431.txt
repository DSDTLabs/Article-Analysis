PANAJI: The in-camera trial in the alleged rape case against former Tehelka editor-in-chief, Tarun  , began on Thursday at the additional district and sessions court, Mapusa, with the deposition of the survivor.

 During the in-camera trial, which will continue over the next two days, only the accused, his counsel, the survivor and the prosecution were allowed inside the court. Even investigating officer, DySP  , was not permitted inside the court. 
 
 Tejpal, who arrived at the court with his wife, daughters, brother and other family members, addressed reporters before the trial commenced. “The truth will come out. You will see the truth coming out soon,” he said. 
 
 Tejpal, represented by advocate  , has filed three applications seeking additional documents and call records. “The survivor’s examination was recorded. It will continue for the next two days. Some applications have been filed by Tejpal to which we will be filing a reply,” special public prosecutor  , said.
 
 The Mapusa court had, in September last year, framed charges against Tejpal for raping a junior colleague in a five-star hotel at   in November 2013. He had pleaded not guilty, paving the way for a trial in the case.
