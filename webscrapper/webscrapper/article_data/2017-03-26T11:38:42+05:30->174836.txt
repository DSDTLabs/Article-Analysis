NAGPUR: Close on the heels of an agitation launched by resident doctors,   (MESTA) has demanded that a law should be enacted to   and students to ensure their safety.

 Addressing a press conference at Ravi Bhavan on Saturday, MESTA president   said that the government should introduce a legislation to protect schools from lumpen elements who can resort to vandalism and ensure that no agitators reached the premises within the 100 metres radius. This will help teachers and students feel assured that they would not be subjected to hooliganism over trivial issues, Tayade said, citing some past instances. 
 
 Meanwhile, MESTA has threatened to launch an agitation across the state if the government did not reimburse dues running into crores of rupees under Right To Education admissions within eight days. Tayade said that various schools are yet to get a sum of approximately Rs450 crore from the government under the scheme. Despite taking up the issue with the education minister, there seems to be no solution in sight. “The government was not paying heed to the decision of the high court delivered in 2015 and was delaying payment,” Tayade charged.
 
 There are 40,000 schools in   which are waiting for the payment. The quality of education has taken a hit due to funds crunch, which, in turn, affected students, he claimed. If the government did not react after a daylong agitation, the students who took admissions under   and their parents would be roped in during the future agitation, he warned. This would be done as such studies of such children are also affected due to non-payment, he added. MESTA also demanded cancellation of implementation Fee Regulation Act as the Parents Teachers Association existed in schools to decide on the issue. 
 
 Shahid Sharif, chairman of NGO RTE Action Committee, claimed that the government was not following the RTE regulations properly which affected students.
