NOIDA: Amid dance, drama and music, cancer-stricken children at   in Sector 26 celebrated   with flowers with the members of the youth wing of Lions Club   —   — and other youth leaders of the city on Sunday.

 “We celebrated the festival of colours with flowers with 42 children, from economically weaker sections under the age of 14, from across the country,” said Aditya Srivastava district president, Leo Club.
 
 The centre provides accommodation and transport facilities to hospitals across the city to terminally ill cancer patients under the age of 14. The children here also participated in the Holika-Prahlad drama and danced their hearts out to Holi-special numbers.
 
 During the celebrations, the kids also got a chance to revisit the history of the festival. “Fruits and beverages were distributed to excited children on the occasion,” Srivastava said, adding that the celebration was a small effort on the part of the youth club members to bring a smile to the faces of these terminally ill children.
 
 He added that they chose to celebrate Holi with flowers as the cancer patients were advised to not play with colours.
