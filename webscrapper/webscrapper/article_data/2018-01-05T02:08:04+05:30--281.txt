GURUGRAM: A couple of Sushant Lok 1 residents have complained of   payable in the months of winter, and slammed   for recurring goof-ups.

 They also alleged the discom added the old bills with the current ones even though they had cleared the previous dues.
 
 “I had received a bill of Rs 8,399 in August (2017), which I paid through net banking on September 3. Then I received a bill of Rs 17,958 in October, which included the previous bill amount (Rs 8,399) plus surcharge. It was paid on November 1,” claimed Atul Dev, one of the aggrieved consumers.
 
 “Again, I received my December bill of Rs 7,398. According to discom officials, I haven’t paid the August bill. Technically, it should reflect the payment as credit in my account balance,” he added. On January 1, he submitted proof of the payment he had made against the August bill to the complaint centre at DHBVN.
 
 Another resident Sujata Devi too complained about the faulty system, which resulted in inflated bills. “I also received hefty bills. We pay the bills but the payments do not reflect in our accounts with the DHBVN,” she alleged. She claimed that one of her neighbours was also facing the same problem, which was resolved recently. 
 
 When contacted, DLF City subdivision officer Kuldeep Nehra asked the aggrieved consumers to visit his office on Thursday to get their issues resolved.
