AHMEDABAD: It’s the same mansion built by   Dalpatbhai in 1905 for his family in  , witnessing generations blooming and carrying forward the legacy of centuries – starting from Shantidas Zaveri. On Sunday, Lalbaug got formally converted into   (KL) Museum, housing legacy of past generations with a dash of modernity. The museum is the brainchild of Sanjay Lalbhai, CMD, Arvind Limited, his wife Jayshree, and other family members.

 “We have put up the contemporary art collection but we want to keep changing it at least twice a year. Architect Rahul Mehrotra is working on the new space housing history of Lalbhai family spanning 17 generations,” said Sanjay Lalbhai. Jayshree Lalbhai said that the museum will be open for public from February 16. “It will be a guided tour – one in the morning and another in the evening – on prior registration basis. The purpose is to take them through various sections in a planned manner,” she said.
