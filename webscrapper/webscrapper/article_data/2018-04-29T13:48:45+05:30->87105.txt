INDORE: Tin sheds and several illegal structures erected by over 100 retail and wholesale   and fruit agents were demolished in   by Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) on Saturday.

 Confirming the action, IMC additional commissioner   told TOI, “The sheds were illegally erected and were affecting vehicular movement. Therefore, the structures were removed to ease traffic.
 
 According to him, before the civic body embarked on the removal drive, all the owners of demolished structures were served with removal order notice a month ago. Also, announcement about the   was made through loudspeaker on Friday. 
 
  “We have been doing business here for the last two decades. We had erected the tin sheds to protect our produce from rains and sunrays. Now, we will be forced to do business alongside the road from tomorrow,” wholesale vegetable agents’ association president Bablu Yadav said.
 
 He claimed that as many as 1000 farmers from Indore and neighbouring areas bring their perishable items, including vegetables and fruits, at Rajkumar Mill Mandi to sell them to retailers through the agents.
 
 “Over 500 pushcart vegetable and roadside traders purchase fruits and vegetables and sell them across the city to earn their livelihood. Besides, the produce is also supplied to many eateries on daily basis. Any disturbance in the routine working of Rajkumar Mill Mandi will interrupt the entire vegetable and fruit supply system,” Yadav claimed.
 
 SDM Shashwat Sharma said, “Thirty shops are authorised by the mandi committee and they will continue with their daily business. The farmers can go to   to sell their crops. We will move the affected agents’ proposal of providing them alternative space to continue the business before the senior authorities, including collector and IMC commissioner. They will take further decision.”
 
 During the removal drive, police force from three police stations led by CSP, BPS Parihar remained presence to avoid any untoward incident.
