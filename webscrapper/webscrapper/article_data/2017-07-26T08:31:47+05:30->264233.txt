MUMBAI: The 13-year-old who consumed rat   on July 12, days after he was sodomised along with his 10-year-old friend, died on Tuesday at a public hospital following  . Though his name was registered right on top of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) list for an emergency organ transplant, the hospital failed to get a liver that matched his blood group. The Class VIII student had named one Zahid as one of the four men who had sodomised the boys on June 6. 

 Meanwhile, Powai police have   the body of the 10-year-old Class V student who had died a day after consuming poison with his older friend. The body was sent to J J Hospital on Tuesday. One of the doctors at J J Hospital, who carried out a post-mortem, said, “The body has decomposed so it may be challenging to find signs of sexual assault. But we will try our best to gather evidence.”
 
 Doctors at KEM Hospital where the older boy was undergoing treatment said he developed multi-organ failure and ultimately succumbed to it. “In cases where the liver has completely failed, kidney is the next casualty. His kidneys were affected too. He was already on life support. On Tuesday morning, his blood pressure dropped drastically,” said a doctor.
 
 The doctors hoped against hope that he would get a liver. Around 200 people are currently on ZTCC’s waitlist for a liver but barely 10% are likely to get an organ by the year-end. His body was sent for an autopsy. A doctor said his viscera is preserved for chemical analysis.
 
 The 10-year-old lived with his parents and a younger brother in his friend’s neighbourhood. A police source said they have recorded statements of more than a dozen kids and have got mixed descriptions of the accused. “We exhumed the 10-year-old’s body after getting the executive magistrate permission on Monday. The body has been sent to J J Hospital for forensic analysis to find out the cause of death,” said deputy commissioner of police (Zone X) Navinchandra Reddy.
