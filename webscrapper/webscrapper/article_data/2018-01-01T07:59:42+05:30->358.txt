HYDERABAD: Several Muslim organisations, including   have condemned the statement of Prime Minister   about Muslim   travelling for Haj on their own.

 Speaking at Mann Ki Baat on Sunday, Prime Minister Modi said that the government has removed the policy pertaining to Muslim women performing Haj only in the presence of a male guardian.
 
 
  
 
 He said that the decision was taken after many women applied to travel alone. Women aged over 45 could make the Haj pilgrimage without their 'mahram' or close male relatives if travelling in groups of four, according to   (GOI).
 
 The organisation said the decision of sending a women without male accompanying them is against the Shariyat.
 
 “According to the Shariyat, if a women wants to perform Haj, it should be done in the company of mahram. If women perform Haj without mahram it means that they are not following Shariyat,” said Obedullah from Jamia Nizamia.
 
 Anwar Ahmed, a professor from Jamia Nizamia said the new rule will hardly do any good for the Muslim women. “Instead of focusing on such issues, the central government should introduce some initiatives like education schemes that will help the Muslim women in real sense. Will the government take care of our women if mahram does not go with them ?” asked Anwar Ahmed.
 
 All   secretary said that a male companion is must for a women going to Haj. “She will be safe and secure if accompanied by mahram. However this is my personal view,” said Khalid Saif Ullah Rehmanai secretary of the board.
