BARNALA: The Congress MLA from Barnala, Kewal Singh Dhillon, has such a fetish for wristwatches that he has distributed nearly 1,000 of them among his supporters and members of his election campaign staff.

 The watches distributed by Dhillon, who is the party’s candidate from Barnala assembly constituency again, sport a picture of his behind the dial. When asked about the watches, he said he valued time and wanted all people in his team to value it too. “This is the only reason that we got simple watches prepared, so that our staff members and supporters value time and keep a distinct identity in the constituency by wearing watches which has an appeal to vote for the Congress,” Dhillon told TOI.
 
 Though the wristwatches are simple and inexpensive, they have a picture of Dhillon in the frame along with an appeal to vote for the Congress. He has a special place in his heart for wristwatches too. In the affidavit filed before the   during 2012 assembly elections, Dhillon had shown owning watches worth Rs. 8.91 lakh, his wife   had shown watches worth Rs. 3.84 lakh and his son Karan, who had filed papers as covering candidate, had shown wristwatches worth Rs 4.05 lakh.
 
 Together, the trio owned watches worth Rs 16.8 lakh. While Dhillon and his wife sport Seiko watches, sons Karan and Kanwar own Rolex.
 
 Dhillon was the third richest candidate in the fray in the 2012 assembly elections. Dhillon had declared that he owned total assets worth Rs 78 crore, behind party colleague Karan Kaur (Rs 120 crore) and SAD president   (Rs 90 crore).
