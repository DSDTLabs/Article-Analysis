NEW DELHI: Batteries of personal electronic devices catching fire is the new fear in the sky. The Directorate General of Civil   ( ) is going to ban smart luggage, which include devices with non-removable batteries, from being carried on planes — whether in check-in or as hand bags.

 So far only Jet Airways has banned smart luggage, including devices with integrated  , motors, power banks, GPS, GSM, Bluetooth, RFID or Wi-Fi technology. Jet allows smart bags with lithium battery only if it is possible to remove the battery.
 
  
  
 
 Post-removal, batteries can be carried separately in cabin baggage only. The DGCA rule is also likely to mirror this procedure.
 
 “Among Indian carriers, only Jet has banned smart bags. But people, especially those from abroad, could be travelling with these bags on other Indian airlines and we need to stop that in accordance with International Air Transport Association (IATA) banning such luggage globally,” said a source.
