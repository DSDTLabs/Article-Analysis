NEW DELHI:   minister   on Monday reiterated that the state government will only act against slaughterhouses that are illegal.

 "We have assembled here to give a clarification that it is an investigation only against the  . Those who have licenses have nothing to fear. They should continue following regulations," Singh told reporters at a press briefing in Lucknow.
 
 The   spokesperson also warned officers not to overstep their jurisdiction and the mandate given by the state government.
 
 "We also want to say that officials should use their discretion with the sellers who have licenses. Do not do unnecessary investigation. For instance, if the shops have licenses but don't have CCTVs, as per rule, then the officials don't need to shut them but give them some time to get it installed. Later, they can go an an inspection and check if it has been put," he said.
 
 Singh stated that if a licensed slaughterhouse is contributing to pollution and affecting health, then it must be shut down temporarily in order to set things right.
 
 The cabinet minister clarified that no orders have been issued by the government to close down shops selling chicken and eggs, urging people not to believe news of it going around on social media.
 
 After coming to power, the Yogi Adityanath-led government has ordered the closure of illegal slaughterhouses and strict enforcement of the ban on cow smuggling to fulfill a key electoral promise.
 
 Adityanath earlier on Saturday said abattoirs operating legally will not be touched but action will be taken against those being run illegally.
