NEW DELHI:   at the   on Tuesday evening arrested two passengers for trying to smuggle in   bars worth Rs 2.8 crores from Hong Kong.

 The siblings had specially designed a skin-tight belt which could be worn under their clothes to conceal the gold   and allow them to pass through undetected.
 
 Officials said that the two were intercepted as soon as they crossed the green channel and underwent a thorough check by officials. While the baggage check revealed nothing, the belt was noticed underneath their clothes, despite it being made entirely of cloth. A total of 10 gold bars weighing 1kg each were found from the two passengers, officials added.
 
 “The passengers had made special cloth-belts which could be worn underneath their pants and could conceal gold bars. The total recovered gold is worth Rs 2.8 crores in the market. The belt had been designed specially to hide the gold and we suspect they may have smuggled in gold in similar fashion in the past,” said a senior customs official.
 
 The accused are Indian nationals and were placed under arrest under section 104 of the Customs Act. A probe is underway to determine their connections in the city and where the gold may have been headed, officials said.
