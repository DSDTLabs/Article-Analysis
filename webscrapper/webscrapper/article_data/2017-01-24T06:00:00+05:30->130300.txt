New Delhi: The Supreme Court granted on Monday eight weeksâ€™ time to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) to complete audit of the accounts of Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd (NTBC) to ascertain if it had already recovered the cost and reasonable profit from the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway.

 A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud allowed the plea of CAG seeking more time to submit a report after verifying the claims of the company.
 
 The apex court had on November 11, 2016 refused to grant stay on the Allahabad High Court judgement of October 28, which had made the DND flyway toll-free for commuters, and ordered CAG to verify the cost of the project and submit a report to the court.
 
 It had also directed the firm to place before CAG the entire records pertaining to recovery of the total project cost for the DND flyway as per the agreement.
 
 The high court had ruled that no toll will be collected from those using the 9.2 km stretch of the eight-lane DND flyway. The order was passed by the high court on a PIL by the Federation of Noida Residents' Welfare Association.
