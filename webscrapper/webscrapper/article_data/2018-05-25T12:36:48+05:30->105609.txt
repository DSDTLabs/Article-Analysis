NASHIK: With the state cabinet giving its approval to tranfer 54 acres of land to   (MSAMB) to set up the   proposed at  , MSAMB will be floating the tender for construction of the market in a month or two after it gets possession of the land. 

 The Union government had approved the agriculture terminal market project for Nashik, Mumbai and Nagpur in 2010. The project proposed in   was delayed as the state government had not allotted land for the project. 
 
 The project, which is estimated to cost Rs 60 crore, is to be set up on a public private partnership (PPP) mode.
 
 “The state cabinet has given its approval to transfer 54 acres to MSAMB to set up the agriculture terminal market. The land allotted is at Sayyad Pimpri. The land will be transferred by the state revenue department to MSAMB which is likely to take around two months,” said an official from MSAMB.
 
 According to the official, MSABM will immediately start the process of setting up the terminal market once it gets possession of the land. “We are expecting the agri terminal market to be ready within a year,” he said. 
 
 The proposed market terminal is expected to help farmers get direct access to domestic and international markets.
 
 The market will have cleaning, grading and packing facilities. The agricultural produce will be sent to other cities.
 
 The terminal market will have facilities like an auction hall, cold storages, handling mechanics, banking services and export facilities centres. It will have the capacity to accomodate about 1,000 metric tonnes of agricultural commodities, fruits and vegetables per day.
