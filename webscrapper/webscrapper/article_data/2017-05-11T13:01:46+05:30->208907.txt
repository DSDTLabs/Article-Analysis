A city which thrives on misal is suddenly talking about Kakori and Galawati kebabs. Wonder why?

  Well, a group of enthusiasts in the city came up with a novel idea to merge food and theatre. The idea is to narrate stories behind famous dishes and savour the food while you see how the kebab on your plate made its way to India.
 
  Rahul Ahuja who came up with this idea, got like-minded people together and wrote a play on the origin of Kakori and Galawati kebabs with a modern twist. “Being a foodie, I have always interacted with people involved in the process of food. I am also a theatre enthusiast and came up with this concept of introducing patrons to the origin of a particular dish,” he said. Rahul believes that people usually opt for kebabs while ordering food. Thus, he decided to start his first theatre-food gig in a restaurant in Aundh to tell people about its origin. The play titled   had artistes enact scenes which offered interesting trivia about kebabs. Patrons were also served juicy kebabs while the play was enacted.
 
  
  Radhika Bagdai, a professional storyteller who essays the role of Anarkali said, “We did not want the play to be based on just historic facts. So we introduced lighter moments with the IPL setting and also showed how Salim is engrossed in Snapchat. This got the audience engaged.” Kshitij Malegaonkar, who was dining at the restaurant said, “The act was informative and entertaining and took us back in a time of the nawabs and showcased their fondness for food. In all, it was a laughter riot.” The group which intends to keep the flavour of kebabs in their next few acts plan to move on to South-east Asian cuisine after that. “We plan on doing a play on the cuisines from Vietnam and Thailand. We will also get the chefs from there to present the dish,” said Rahul.
