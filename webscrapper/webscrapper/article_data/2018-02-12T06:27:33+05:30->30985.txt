NAGPUR: NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad on Sunday trashed the judicial probe into   violence saying that as the inquiry report was not binding on the government it was meaningless.

 The inquiry will be done by justice JN Patel, retired chief justice of Calcutta high court. State chief secretary   will be the other member of this panel.
 
 The judicial commission has been given a time of four months to complete the probe. In spite of booking right-wing leaders   and   for instigating the violence, the two have not been arrested so far.
 
 Awhad charged Bhide with creating a schism between Dalits and Marathas. “He will never succeed in dividing the two communities. Bhide keeps quiet on issues of backward classes. The people who are backing him are mad,” the NCP MLA said.
 
 The MLA alleged that Bhide frequently criticized the highly educated people. “He claims to be have degrees in several subjects. He is reportedly also a PhD holder. As per my information, there is no record of Bhide in Fergusson College, from where he is supposed to have earned his degree. At that time, the subject in which Bhide has done his degree was not taught in Fergusson College. Bhide should provide an explanation,” Awhad said.
 
 The MLA further said that judge Loya’s death was suspicious and he would raise the issue in state assembly during the winter session. He also claimed that chief minister Devendra Fadnavis did not enjoy the confidence of his ministers. “He is single-handedly running the government while other ministers are making merry,” Awhad added.
