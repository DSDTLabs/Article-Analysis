Beware, bad guys, there is a new cop in town who is armed and very dangerous! Actor R Madhavan has stepped into the shoes of a police constable for his upcoming crime thriller ‘Vikram Vedha’. The star took to his social networking handle on Thursday afternoon to share his first look from the film.
 
Madhavan shared the monochrome picture which has him standing in the rain while pointing a loaded gun presumably at his arch-nemesis played by Vijay Sethupathi. While it is impossible to miss his macho slicked-back hair and thick stubble, it is the actor’s eyes which is the major highlight of the first look as it conveys the anger and intensity of the cop Vikramadithiyan. 
 
 
 
The first look of Vijay Sethupathi as a gangster from north Chennai was also unveiled today. Unlike Maddy's character picture, this one has Vijay on the receiving end of the gun.  
 
'Vikram Vedha' by director-duo Pushkar and Gayathri is expected to release in the first half of 2017. Stay tuned for more updates.
