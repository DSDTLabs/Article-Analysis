PATNA: Urban development minister   on Monday informed the   that existing food courts and ‘Patna Haat’ inside the Gandhi   here are “purely temporary structures” and they could be removed any time to maintain “original size” of the sprawling ground.

 Responding to a call attention motion of JD (U) member Ram Vachan Rai, the minister said structures like green toilets, food courts, children park, open gym and a ‘Patna Haat’ for promotion of state’s handicrafts had been set up in between the Maidan’s boundary wall and the walking track.
 
 The minister said there was no adverse impact on “original size” and “natural beauty” of   due to construction of makeshift structures.
 
 Earlier, Rai, through his call attention motion, expressed concern over the administration’s attempt to reduce the original size of the ground by providing space for facilities like gym and food parks. “It is being heard that some shops will also be opened alongside the Maidan’s boundary wall. The construction of shops will demolish the Maidan’s original look,” he said and urged the government to issue a statement on whether it wanted to maintain the original size and natural beauty of the city’s largest public ground.
