It’s high time that women go out on the streets,   their public space and represent their own stories, fearlessly. We need more women artists on the streets, making way for critical social justice conversations with marginalized communities and transforming corners of fear and trauma into a canvas of beautiful art. Over the past few years, I have worked extensively with women protesting gender-based violence in South Asia through murals that are an amalgamation of performing and visual arts as well as activism. Through our first public art residency in South Asia this year — which will include 10 artists and activists from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka — we are hoping to reclaim imagination from fear, and trigger more exchange of thoughts.
