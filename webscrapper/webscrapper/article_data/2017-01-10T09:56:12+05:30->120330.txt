 The Lama dance, developed in the eighth century, is believed to remove and destroy the obstacles that come in the way of promoting Buddhism and the Madhyam Marg (middle path) as ordained by Lord Buddha.
 
 The dance performers cut through all obstacles and clear the accumulated negativities of the past. Whereas Lama dance has got distinct spiritual overtones, the Tibetan dance depicts the traditional culture of China-occupied Tibet and Chinese provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan.

The meeting took place in the Dalai's special suite in the Tibetan Monastery guesthouse near the world famous Mahabodhi Temple, the seat of Buddha's enlightenment. The governor presented a memento to the spiritual leader who reciprocated by presenting a 'blessed cloth piece' to the visiting dignitary.
 
 Besides seeking tips on spirituality, the governor is learned to have also discussed the road map for attracting more Buddha followers to Bodh Gaya and other places of the Buddha Circuit in the state. The Dalai is learned to have appreciated the arrangements made by the government agencies for Kalchakra Puja, in which several thousand Buddhists, including Hollywood super star Richard Gere, are participating.
