GURUGRAM: The Kundli-Manesar-Palwal ( ) expressway will be ready in the next two months and work on   will be over within the next 18 months, according to Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority ( ) CEO V Umashankar.

 
 Speaking at the real estate summit organised by NAREDCO in the city on Friday, V Umashankar said   would start construction of the remaining patches of the Dwarka Expressway next week. “The survey is almost done. Some land is to be acquired and acquisition cost has to be finalised. After that, the expressway is likely to be completed within the next 18 months,” he said. 
 
 The summit focused on problems faced by realtors such as delay in grant of licences for housing projects, land acquisition for 24-metre roads, etc.
 
 While discussing the mobility issue, V Umashankar said that if metro expansion had to happen in Haryana, particularly Gurugram, land acquisition applications for the same should be done under the DMRC Act rather than the prevailing land acquisition Act.
 
 At the summit, the minister of finance, Haryana, Captain Abhimanyu Singh said the state would bring in a policy framework for infrastructure development, provided that developers do their part.
 
 “The government and the public have invested more money on infrastructure in the city than the developers. We have also compromised on interests of other parts of Haryana and focussed on development of Gurugram,” said the minister. “In 2017-18, the collection of stamp duty increased from Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore. In this additional Rs 1,000 crore, the share of Gurgaon stands at Rs 300 crore whereas the rest of Haryana contributed Rs 700 crore .”
