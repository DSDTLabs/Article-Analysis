NAGPUR: Around 50 hectares of   reserve forest were gutted in a fresh fire that erupted on Sunday afternoon. There was no response from   range forest officer (RFO)   on exact area that the ground fire covered.

 There have been around dozen fire incidents inside Ambazari forest during the last year. According to eyewitnesses, the Sunday’s fire was seen in the middle of the forest on both sides of the compartment from Wadi side.
 
 The reason behind the fire could not be ascertained. There has been a lot of trespassing inside the forest. Labourers at work inside it may also have ignited the fire by accident after throwing an ignited bidi or cigarette butt.
 
 “Due to wide roads constructed inside the forest, the fire did not spread to entire area and stopped at the edge of the road,” said eyewitnesses.
 
 Bird watchers have been protesting against the forest department move to destroy grasslands for tourism development in the area. “Uncontrolled forest fires pave way for development by default,” said forest sources.
