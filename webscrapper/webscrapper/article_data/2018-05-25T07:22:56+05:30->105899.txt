BENGALURU: The   has taken a toll on the   (SRTUs).

 An analysis done on four SRTUs on May 16 revealed that they incur an additional   of Rs 10 crore a month. Among the SRTUs,   has an additional burden with Rs 3.68 crore, followed by NWKRTC (Rs 2 crore),   (Rs 1.96 crore) and NEKRTC (Rs 1.65 crore).
 
 Four SRTUs require 1,539 kilolitres (KL) of diesel every day. This includes KSRTC (610), BMTC (324), NWKRTC (331) and NEKRTC (274). SRTUs fall in the category of bulk consumers of high-speed diesel (HSD) and its price is revised every fortnight. 
 
 An official said the price of HSD is at an all-time high of Rs 64.88 per litre. “The loss is mounting after the fuel price hike, but bus fares will not be increased for now since the new government is being formed. We could only recommend for fare revision but it is left to the government. We hope the new dispensation will offer financial assistance to cushion the loss. Another option is to cut down on some of the loss-making services till the prices dip. But it will affect people, particularly in rural areas,” said an official. 
 
 BMTC officials said they are now mulling to roll back fare reduction in its AC buses. In the beginning of this year, the fare was slashed by up to 37% on a pilot basis. The initiative was targeted at weaning away passengers from cab aggregators like Ola and Uber.
 
 “The number of passengers has increased after fares were reduced but the operational cost has gone up considerably,” said an official.
 
 Cab drivers and private bus operators are also facing the brunt of the fuel price hike. Some cab drivers have logged off from the aggregator platforms. Sources said many inter-city private bus operators have also increased fares.
