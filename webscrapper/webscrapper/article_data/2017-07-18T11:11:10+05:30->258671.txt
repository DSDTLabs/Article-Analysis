HAZARIBAG: Two   looted nearly Rs 7.50 lakh from a   Pratap Jain and his son Prabal on Monday at around 10am. Pratap said they were going to the bank to deposit the money, which was the sale proceeds of Saturday and Sunday. 

 The incident happened when the duo entered their car which was parked in their own garage with two bags filled with money, unaware of the two criminals who were hiding there. 
 
 As Prabal resisted, the other criminal brought out a revolver and pointed at him which compelled the son to hand over the money bag to the criminal. The criminals then walked out with one of the bags which contained Rs 7.50 lakh before they could raise an alarm.
 
 Pratap said the criminals could not take the other bag containing cash which remained intact with the owner. 
 
 The victims then informed the police and Sadar police station's officer-in-charge. The police later sealed all the points to and from the city and started raids in the area where the miscreants escaped. An FIR was lodged at the police station Prabal and his manager Sunil Jain at Sadar police station.
