Indore: Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has decided to lay down a pipeline in around 19-km area to provide drinking water in as many as seven localities of Ward number 24, 25 and 26. In its bid to solve the issue of drinking water shortage in Janta Quarter, Patanipura, Sarvahara Nagar, Tapu Nagar, Nanda Nagar, Nehru Nagar and Malawa Mill area, the corporation had erected an overhead water tank with a capacity of 30 lakh litre of water in 2015-16. It had cost of around Rs 2.5 Crore. The civic body however could not lay down the pipeline and thus, the wait of the local residents to get drinking water lasted long. In a review meeting with IMC officials, Mayor Malini Gaud expressed displeasure over delay of the work. According to IMC officials, a Gujarat-based company M/s Utsav Infra Projects Private Limited was assigned the contract to lay down the pipeline in 19 km area in Rs 3.39 Crore on October 10, 2017. Despite of passing over three months, any progress in the work was yet to be witnessed. Following this, the mayor asked the officials concerned to coordinate with the company and speed up the project. After the project will be completed, residents of the aforesaid localities in three wards of the area will be benefited the most.
