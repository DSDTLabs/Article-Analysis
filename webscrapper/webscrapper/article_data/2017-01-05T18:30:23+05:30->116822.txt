Yes, it was an eventful year and I must say it ended with a bang thanks to Dhruva. I have been getting positive responses from everyone. What makes it extra special is the fact that my uncle   produced the film! I have received immense love for the film, particularly for picking a story as unconventional as this and for giving importance to the script. I guess going forward too, I’ll just try to keep that going. 
 
 
 
 True. satisfying both the critics as well as audiences — that too, all sections of the audience — is pretty difficult in  . But Dhruva seems to have cracked both. What more can I ask for!
 Frankly, I don’t know what the audiences are expecting, but I’d like to believe I’m on the right path. I want to keep doing films on unconventional subjects. Having said that, I love commercial films. I want to try and redefine how we have understood commercial cinema so far. I want to appeal to the larger audiences while giving the subject of the films the importance they deserve. 
 
 
 
 I have signed three films already and the first of them will be with  . I’m very excited about the project. It is an out and out village story and I haven’t played a character like that before. We will be starting the shoot for it this month and the details of the other two projects will be announced soon too. But what I’m really excited about is working with my father in his 150th film. I will be doing a 30-second guest appearance in it as well. Sharing screenspace with him is always a pleasure and also overwhelming. The minute we face the camera, he is not my father anymore. He is the Megastar — his aura itself is so stunning! In the little cameo I did, I took so many takes! (laughs) but he was patient enough and let me take my time.
  
 
 
 It was great! In fact I am just fulfilling my mother’s dream. She always wanted to produce a film and I’m doing this for her. And what’s better than her son producing her husband’s comeback film. It’s just perfect!
