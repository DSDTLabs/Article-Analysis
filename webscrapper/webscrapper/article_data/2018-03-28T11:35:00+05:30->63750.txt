HYDERABAD: In a frenzy to race ahead, many city commuters give traffic rules a miss.

 Latest data provided by Hyderabad traffic cops shows that 1,54,015 vehicles were penalised in 2017 for violating the ‘stop line’ near traffic signals while 1,120 cases were registered of ‘disobeying’ the traffic signal.
 
  
 “At many junctions in Hyderabad, vehicles can be found violating the traffic signal and taking a right or making U-turns even after the signal has turned from green to red. This is because commuters are well aware of the fact that there is a four-or fivesecond window before the signal on the other side turns green,” said  , a resident of Himayatnagar.
 
 Data available with the police also shows how 76 cases were registered where drivers overtook a vehicle from the left side.
 
 Another 72 cases of taking sudden turns without indication, 40 cases of failure to give right-of-way and 60 cases of ‘erratic braking’ were also booked in 2017.
 
 “Often even as VIP vehicles are found zipping through traffic smoothly, ambulances are found stuck in traffic jams. It is high time that the traffic police ensure a smooth passage for ambulances and fire trucks,” said   P, a resident of Madhapur.
 
 Road safety experts call for better traffic infrastructure and awareness campaigns to curb such violations on city roads which have become increasingly rampant.
 
 “At present, timers at many junctions are working while at many other junctions, they do not. Commuters in such cases are found disregarding traffic signals. The stop lines at junctions should also be well behind the traffic signal to curb violations,” said  , CEO of the Indian Federation of Road Safety (IFROS). He also said that, “large-scale awareness campaigns on lane discipline must be taken up by the city police. On the eight-lane ORR, for instance, lane violations occur often.”
