An Andheri-based fabrication worker was booked on Saturday for making lewd gestures at an air hostess. The Sahar police filed a case against Lagnesh Kumar Makwana (33) under section 509 of the Indian Penal Code for outraging the modesty of a woman. 

 The incident happened on an Air India flight travelling from Bangkok to Mumbai flight (AI 331), which landed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji   Airport late at 11.40 pm on Friday.
 
 According to the air hostess, around 10.25 pm, when the flight was facing turbulence, the airline captain had asked the airline staff to ensure all the passengers were seated and their seatbelts fastened.
 
 As she was checking the passengers, Makwana got up from his seat and started to make obscene sounds. When she instructed him to take his seat, he made lewd gestures at her.
 
 The victim reported the incident to the captain and the cabin crew. As per procedure, the cabin crew alerted the air traffic control (ATC), who, in turn, alerted the   (CISF). When the flight landed, the   apprehended Makwana and handed him over to the police. 
 
 The last two months have seen three cases of sexual harassment on board an aircraft. Earlier this month, two   residents were arrested for touching a co-passenger inappropriately on board a Delhi-Mumbai flight. 
 
 In June, a Navi Mumbai woman complained that a passenger tried to grope her and flashed at her on a   flight. A lawyer also became a victim of sexual harassment when an IT staffer allegedly touched her inappropriately on a Delhi-Mumbai flight.
