AHMEDABAD: The   in its economic sector report stated that the Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) areas have shrunken in the state. The reduction in the areas in the final ESZ notification ranges from 51% to 99% of the draft proposal. The watchdog noted that this was done even though there were no objections from the stake holders — villagers or local people.

 The CAG noted that the shrinking of the ESZ areas may jeopardize the long-term efforts for wildlife conservation and will adversely impact the environment. The CAG observed that the draft proposal was prepared on the guidelines set by the ministry of environment forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) following detailed and scientific studies of habitats and wildlife corridor.
 
 The CAG reported that the audit scrutiny revealed that no representation was received for reduction in ESZ area for forest land and government waste land because the government itself was its custodian. 
 
 The CAG gave examples of three sanctuaries — Nalsarovar, Hingolgadh and Velavadar — and observed that the ESZ in the final notification got reduced by 90%, 87% and 99% respectively.
 
 As of July 2017, out of 23 wildlife sanctuaries and four national parks, draft notifications for declaration of ESZ around 17 sanctuaries and four parks have been issued. Out of these, MoEF&CC has issued final ESZ notifications for 10 sanctuaries and three parks.
