  :   will return to haunt citizens, but this year it will be due to the   and not lack of rainfall. 

 With summer being just around the corner, the city's water demand is expected to swell by almost 20-25 MLD. Even though the municipal authorities have plans to strengthen the supply system, it would add only 2 MLD to the existing 100-110 MLD.
 
 Sartaj Singh Chahel, in charge of the water supply and executive engineer in   told TOI that the civic body has planned to repair all the 30-35 leakages on the main pipelines to prevent water losses. "We believe that about 2 MLD water could be saved because of the proposed repair work," said.
 
 Although Chahel refused to comment on the increased demand of water during summer, water experts believe that the demand increases by about 20-25 MLD.
 
 Before launching into the 36-hour mega shutdown of main water supply lines, the municipal body has decided to fix 20 minor leakages on the 700mm and 1,400mm thickness pipelines located on the 45km long stretch between the city and Jayakwadi dam. The repair works are expected to begin from Saturday. "Initially we will repair all the minor leakages without switching off the main line and will plan the shutdown somewhere in the second week of the current month," Chahel said. 
 
 Both the water supply lines (700mm and 1,400mm) are 20-25 years old and have developed several leakages. The authorities have carried out numerous repairs over the years, but have not been able to prevent water losses.
 
 During a survey of the pipelines in 2007-08, it was found that almost 58% of the water was lost to leakages. Interestingly, the authorities have not conducted any survey since then, but it is widely believed that the current losses are well above the tolerable limits.
 
 In 2016, the erstwhile   had carried out large scale repair and maintenance work and had claimed to have drastically reduced the losses.
