LUCKNOW: The Allahabad high court, while granting bail last week to hero-turned villain Dr   in  's   tragedy, came down heavily on prosecution and said there was no evidence on record to suggest medical negligence by the doctor. 

 
  Khan was nodal officer at state-run   where 32 children had died on August 10-11 last year allegedly due to the shortage of liquid oxygen in the wards. 
 
  The court had granted bail on a plea by Khan, who was charged with criminal conspiracy and negligence while on duty at. Khan had shot to fame after it was found that he had arranged a batch of medical oxygen cylinders from a private vendor from his own money on August 10-11 night. He was suspended a day later. 
 
  The court also said that the UP government, in its affidavit, never 'attributed the deaths to 'shortage of oxygen'. The state government and the UP police have maintained that the kids' death was natural and unrelated to shortage of oxygen, yet it booked doctors and BRD hospital staff for medical negligence. 
 
 "Having considered the submissions advanced, the court notes that there is no material on record, which may establish medical negligence against the applicant individually," Justice   said in his order.
 
  Khan was released from Gorakhpur jail on Saturday and was greeted by his family members and a crowd of local patients. Images of Khan weeping inconsolably and hugging his wife, mother and daughter went viral online. The court further pointed out that Khan 'is a medical practitioner, a government employee with no criminal history'. 
 
  The HC also observed that though UP police, in its FIR and chargesheet, showed Khan as head of the ward where the kids allegedly died, he was nowhere involved in the tendering process of medical oxygen.
