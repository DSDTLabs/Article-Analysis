PATNA: In an apparent attempt to pooh-pooh the doomsayers speculating over his removal from the Bihar cabinet following the CBI raids against him and his family on July 7, deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav released photographs that showed him playing   with his nephews at his mother and former CM Rabri Devi’s official bungalow in Patna on Tuesday.

 “Just play, have fun. Enjoy the game because sports don't build character. They reveal it,” the former Ranji cricketer wrote below the five photographs uploaded to his Twitter handle around 2pm.
 
 A crucial JD (U) meet, convened by CM Nitish Kumar reportedly to decide his fate, was underway around the time when the photos made way to the social media.
 
 The 27-year-old also posted a 32-second video in which he is heard telling his nephew, “I'll show you (how to hit).”
 
 The deputy CM is an accused in an FIR lodged by CBI on July 5 on charges that he partly owns the Lara (Lalu- Rabri) Projects LLP, which was allegedly transferred three acres of land at Saguna Mor in Patna by a private firm in lieu of getting contract for maintaining two railway hotels when his father and RJD boss Lalu Prasad was railway minister.
 
 While Tejashwi relaxed playing cricket, RJD functionaries like state president Ramchandra Purbey, finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui and spokesman Shakti Yadav were at Rabri’s residence to show solidarity with the family. 
 
 “Tejashwi has done exemplary work as deputy CM — be it construction of roads or new bridges. He has created an ever- lasting impression on the youths in Bihar. That is why BJP is after him,” Shakti later told reporters. 
 
 Lalu met party members in the evening after he returned from Ranchi where he appeared in a CBI court in a fodder scam case in which he is an accused.
