PUNE:   clinched silver in men's 10m air pistol of   in Changwon, Korea, on Tuesday. With this medal, Rizvi proved that his record-breaking gold in the first edition of the World Cup in Guadalajara, Mexico, was no fluke.

 
 
 
 
 The Uttar Pradesh shooter had shot 242.3 in the final to create a new final World Record in his World Cup debut last month. On Tuesday, he qualified sixth for the eight-man final with a modest score of 582.
 
 Rizvi shot 239.8 in the final and missed the gold by only 0.2 point.
 
 Though, Rizvi, 24, started with 10s in the first round of five shots in the final, three 9s in the second 5-shot rounds lowered his total ahead of the 2-shot elimination rounds.
 
 He tried to improve his shots, but failed to shoot higher 10s. But to his comfort, other shooters, barring the eventual gold medallist,   of Russia, too shot lower 10s or 9s throughout.
 
 The Indian was placed second, below Chernousov, throughout the 24-shot final and after the 18th shot, Rizvi was 4.3 points behind the Russian.
 
 It was then, he changed gears and shot 10.6, 10.6, 10.9 and 10.2 in his next four shots to minimise the gap. Before the last two shots, Rizvi was only 0.4 point behind Chernousov. But the Indian shot 9.9 and 10, while the Russian's 9.7 and 10 were enough to win gold with a small margin.
 
 Chernousov, with 240, topped the podium, while the bronze went to Bulgaria's Samuil Donkov, with 217.1.
 
 Other Indians, Om   and   (both from Army) failed to enter the final. Mitharval shot 581, as four other shooters did, and missed the last-8 spot on the virtue of lesser inner 10s. The seventh and eighth qualifiers, China's Qifeng Pu and Ukraine's Viktor Bankin respectively had also shot 581, but they had shot 24 inner 10s each, compared to Mitharval's 18.
 
 Mitharval finished 11th in the table. Rai, on the other hand had a forgettable outing as he scored 575 to finish 38th in the 87-shooter qualification round.
 
 Rizvi said he was happy with the medal, but there is a lot more to work on.
 
 "I was aiming for the gold medal, but the last shot didn't go as per my wish. I did my best to reduce the margin, but it all fell flat in the last shot. Nonetheless, this silver will boost my confidence for the Munich World Cup, which is next month and later the World Championships at the same range in August," he told TOI.
 
 Rizvi's Whataspp status read: "2020 Olympic gold mera hai."
 
 "This is a sort of reminder I have put, so that I don't get distracted. It is my goal to win gold in the Tokyo Games and I have already started working towards it. Winning a quota with a gold medal in the World Championships will be a first step towards my aim," said Rizvi, who trains under Ronak Pandit.
