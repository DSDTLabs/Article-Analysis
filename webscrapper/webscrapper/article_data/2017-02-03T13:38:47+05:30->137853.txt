MATHURA: Asserting that the   (RLD) has not been weakened by SP's rejection to include it in the alliance for Uttar Pradesh 
  , party general secretary   said they had wanted to join the alliance earlier as SP supremo   had cried over phone.

 "The SP-Congress alliance has attacked us with a baton to break us but the RLD has not been weakened. We have become even more stronger and would break the baton," he said while addressing a rally in support of RLD candidate from Mathura assembly constituency Ashok Aggarwal on Thursday.
 
 "If your friend cries and pleads for help, will you refuse to help? Chaudhary sahab (Ajit Singh) did no wrong. He took his decision (to ally with SP) within two minutes as Mulayam Singh Yadav was crying over phone and pleaded for help," Chaudhary said.
 
 Taking a dig at UP Chief Minister  , the former Mathura MP said "running metro train for 600 metres and advertising in full swing are not called development".
 
 He said that it has become Akhilesh's habit to fight with his family members.
