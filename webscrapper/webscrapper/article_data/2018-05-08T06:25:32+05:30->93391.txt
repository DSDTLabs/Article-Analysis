AHMEDABAD:   on Monday sought reply from the state government and commissioner of mid-day meal scheme after an association of organizers of mid-day meals demanded at least minimum wage instead of a meagre Rs 1,600 paid to them every month as honorarium.

 Petitioner   has urged the high court to treat 24,000 odd organizers of the scheme in villages and towns across the state as regular government employees, and pay them accordingly.
 
 Petitionerâ€™s advocate K R Koshti submitted before the court that the objective of the scheme is to bring the nutrition levels up for young kids by providing them food in schools. The purpose of the scheme is also to provide employment opportunities to the women belonging to the backward community and preferably widows, destitute and deserted women belonging to a class below poverty line. Even the Supreme Court in its order for proper implementation of the scheme talked about preference for women as organizers, help and cooks, the lawyer contended.
 
 The petition further contended that the mid-day meal scheme organizers are working as such on a meagre honorarium which is insufficient to meet both ends meet. The action of the state government is tantamount to misusing and exploiting persons living below poverty line as they have no bargaining power. The state government being a model employer should act fairly and reasonably with its employees, the petition said.
 
 The petitioner has urged the HC to direct the government to pay these workers as per the Minimum Wages Act till the court takes a final decision on the demand for regular payment and jobs.
 
 After issuing notice, Justice R M Chhaya has posted further hearing on this matter after summer vacation.
