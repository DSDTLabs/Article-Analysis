KOLKATA: The  , which is likely to carry out fresh raids in the   fraud case, is now zeroing in on some of the linked companies of the promoter that had ventured into real estate and special economic zone development in Bengal. The move comes after the central investigating agency stumbled upon a company created for mall development. During the raids at the jewellery showrooms and shop-in-shops, the seizure amount in   alone crossed Rs 61crore.

 Formed in 2008, the company ventured into SEZ development in the state. While its registered office continued to remain in   (east), Mumbai, it formed a special purpose vehicle, wholly owned by a subsidiary of the gems and jewellery company. The company received necessary clearances from the Centre by 2008 and undertook establishment of units that produce, distribute, import and export “multiple varieties of goods”. According to ED sources, there are different companies owned by the jewellery group promoter and they need to look into each of their balance sheets.
 
 In case of the mall development company floated by the jeweller, the agencies are trying to find out why the company continued with the business despite making losses for consecutive years.
 
 Meanwhile, the ED officials finished the search at two of the south Kolkata jewellery showrooms on Friday night. The agency seized jewellery worth Rs 16.5 crore. So far it has seized jewellery and precious stones worth more than Rs 50 crore. The mother brand, owned by the jeweller, had floated several jewellery brands over the years that were doing good business across the city.
