GURGAON: The ongoing   in several parts of the   on Monday.

 The   that hit many Huda sectors, including 21, 22, 23, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45, Sushant Lok I and   in old Gurgaon, on Saturday and Sunday, reached sectors 55 and 56 on Monday.
 
 While residents in some of the affected areas said they got water just twice during the day and that too, for only 20 minutes, those living in   I said they did not receive a single drop of water in the past 24 hours.
 
 Residents said they were left with no other option but to pay through the nose for water from tankers for their daily needs. “We have been buying water tankers for the past three days. As temperature is soaring, the usage of water has increased. None of my family members could take bath in the morning as the water tanker reached late. I just want to know how long the water crisis will prevail in Gurgaon,” said Sonali Tiwari, a resident of Sector 40.
 
 Some residents had to stay awake the entire night for the water connection to resume. Priya Pahuja, a resident of Sector 22, said, “I got up at 3 am as water generally comes around that time. If I don’t get up early, we will have to spend as much as Rs 500 a day on water tankers.”
 
 Residents of Sushant Lok I, on the other hand, blamed Huda for prolonged water crisis. “Supply from Huda is always inadequate. Moreover, it’s the responsibility of the developer to make sure that water is supplied through borewells. The major problem is lack of basic infrastructure at borewells,” Nishi Karnani, a resident, said.
 
 But a spokesperson for Profac, Sushant Lok I’s maintenance agency, said, “There is no fault in any borewell. Supply is short from Huda’s side due to shifting of master pipeline for underpass construction.” 
 
 Huda officials, however, blamed NHAI for the delay in shifting of pipelines for underpass construction. “While we requested NHAI to complete work close to water pipelines before March 31, there is still work left,” said a Huda official.
