THANE: A mother and her two daughters were convicted of abducting a minor boy and sentenced to five years’ rigorous imprisonment following a four-year trial in the district sessions court here.

 Additional sessions judge SC   held   (45) and her two daughters Pinky (26) and Kiran (19) guilty and also fined them Rs10,000 each. One of their aides Tinku Sahu, who had reportedly demanded Rs 26 lakh ransom from the victim’s mother, was acquitted.
 
 Police inspector Kishor Khairnar and  , then posted at  , had tracked the minor to a village in   within four days of his abduction in January 24, 2014.
 
 It is learnt that Pinky, a waitress in a Mira Road bar, had plotted the kidnap to avenge insult by the boy’s mother, who also worked as a singer in the same bar.
 
 The boy’s mother was the second wife of a diamond merchant and Pinky thought they would pay the hefty ransom.
 
 Advocate V   told the court Pinky used her then eight-yearold daughter to lure the victim. She sent her daughter to her colleague’s house and asked her to fetch the boy on the pretext of buying chocolates from a nearby shop.
 
 Pinky’s mother had flown down from her home in West Bengal and had taken the boy back with her in a train.
