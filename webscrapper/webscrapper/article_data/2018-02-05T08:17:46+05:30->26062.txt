WASHINGTON: People who make an effort to lose weight are not just helping themselves, they may be helping others too, a study suggests.

 Researchers have found that when one member of a couple commits to  , chances are good their partner will lose some weight too, even if they are not actively participating in a weight loss intervention. They tracked the weight loss progress of 130 couples over six months.
 
 In the study, about one third of the untreated partners lost 3% or more of their initial body weight after six months despite not participating in any active intervention. “When one person changes their behaviour, the people around them change,” said  , from the   in the US.
 
 The study, published in the journal ‘Obesity’, also found that the rate at which couples lose weight is interlinked. In other words, if one member lost weight at a steady pace, their partner did too. Likewise, if one person struggled to lose weight, their partner also struggled.
