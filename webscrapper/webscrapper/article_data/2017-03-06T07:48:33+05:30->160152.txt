PATNA: Will the annual Budget of Patna University (PU) approved by the senate on Saturday receive any attention of the state government which has already presented its Budget for the next financial year (2017-18)?

 Academics feel that the entire exercise of formulating Budget and getting approval from various statutory bodies like finance committee, syndicate and senate becomes meaningless if it is not submitted to the state government well in time. State higher education director Khalid Mirza had asked the universities to submit their Budget proposals to the government latest by December 28 last year so that they could be included in the state Budget. But, not a single university in the state could submit its Budget estimates by that time.
 
 PU English department head  , who walked out of the senate meeting on Saturday in protest against the alleged violation of the rules of conduct of business, said the whole exercise of Budget approval became farcical as the same was not submitted to the government on time. He said due to delay in submission of the budget estimates on time, the university would be given ad-hoc grants for its sustenance. This would naturally result in delayed payment of salaries to the teachers and non-teaching staff of the university, he added.
 
 Thakur also criticized the PU authorities for not adhering to the norms of the conduct of the senate meeting. “The meeting should have first confirmed the proceedings of the last senate meeting before taking up any other item on the agenda, but it did not take place. Further, the questions asked in writing by the senators were not answered by the authorities as there was no question hour in the meeting. Surprisingly, the replies to the questions asked by the senators were approved by the syndicate in its meeting held on February 25 itself. But, one fails to understand as to what prevented the PU authorities from placing the university’s replies before the senate,” he added.
