NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari and MP Parvesh Verma started a   across 27 municipal wards of Najafgarh and adjoining assembly constituencies on Monday afternoon. 

 During the campaign, Tiwari visited wards in Dwarka, Matiala, Uttam Nagar, Vikaspuri and Najafgarh assembly constituencies and made big-ticket announcements. He said if BJP is voted to power, it would make “special provision in the budget for the allocation of Rs 200 crore each in south and north corporations and Rs 25 crore in east corporation, which will be used for developing infrastructure in rural wards”. 
 
 Tiwari emphasised that this fund would be used to develop community centres, drainage system, open gyms and maintenance of roads and parks in rural wards.
 
 He said Congress and CM Arvind Kejriwal were two sides of the same coin as both have together betrayed the people of unauthorised colonies and rural areas.
 
 In the first phase of their campaign, which started at 10 am, Tiwari visited Dabri, Sagarpur, Manglapuri, Nangli Sakrawati, Kakrola, Dwarka A, Matiala, Dwarka B, Chhawla, Ghumman Hera, Bindapur, Uttam Nagar, Navada and Mohan Garden.
 
 “People living in unauthorised colonies were promised that their colonies will be regularized, but the funds required for the necessary survey to start this work has not been given to the municipal corporations. The people living in villages were deprived of the development due to which today there is not even sufficient drinking water or schools and colleges in the rural areas,” Tiwari said.
 
 However, BJP, which has been ruling the corporations for the past decade, is accused of doing little for the rural wards. 
 
 Post delimitation, most of the urban wards have been merged with unauthorised colonies and rural areas, which has brought more focus of parties on these areas. Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken, while launching his party’s roadmap, emphasised on the allocation of Rs 2,000 crore for development in these zones.
