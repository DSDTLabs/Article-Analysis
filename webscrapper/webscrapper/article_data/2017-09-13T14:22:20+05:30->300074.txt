COIMBATORE: The school   has issued notices to the teachers who staged protests against the state government for not implementing the seventh pay commission and quashing the current pension scheme. T

 The department has also warned teachers of stern action if they continue to participate in the protests.
 
 Speaking to TOI, an official of the school education department said that they have issued notices to teachers who took part in the protests organised by the Joint Action Committee of Teachers’ Organisation –   (JACTTO-GEO) on September 7 and 8. “We have issued notices to all teachers who took part in the protest on September 8,” the officer said. 
 
 As per the section 17 A of the rule book of the department, the teachers will be awarded minor punishment for this offence, said the official. 
 
 “There are possibilities of converting this to offence under section 17-B that may lead to an enquiry. And, if proven guilty, the person can be deprived of promotion or increment for one year,” the official added. 
 
 The JACTTO- GEO condemns this move from the department.
 
  “We have all the rights to protest against the government. The officials are mounting pressure on us by issuing notices,” said the convener of JACTTO-GEO, E Senthil Kumar. “Not only teachers, but we hear that government employees from other departments too have been issued notices,” he added. 
 
 The two organisations have been protesting against the state government asking to provide 20% interim compensation for failing to implement the seventh pay commission and quash the pension scheme for government employees that was introduced in 2003.
