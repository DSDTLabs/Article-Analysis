GUWAHATI: In the age of VVIP culture in the country, Manipur chief minister   sacrificed his VVIP lounge at the Guwahati airport for an ailing pregnant passenger and waited with other passengers in the common lounge. 

 Biren had to wait in Guwahati after the flight he was on - from New Delhi to   - was hit by a bird on Friday. The flight managed to land at Guwahati airport but could not fly further immediately due to the damage.   was ushered to the VVIP lounge to wait until alternative arrangements were made. Later, his staff apprised him of the difficulties being faced by passengers bound for Imphal.
 
  "I came down and a saw a pregnant women kneeling because she could not sit on a normal chair. The airline authorities had made no special arrangements for her," the CM told TOI. He then asked her family and his staff to let her rest in the VVIP lounge. "I was told the doctors had advised bed rest since hers was an IVF pregnancy and therefore, more delicate," he added. 
 
 Moirangthem Thajamanbi Devi, who was also stranded, said, "We had been waiting for hours. When the officials announced the flight has been cancelled, the   was clearly in distress." That was when the CM came to her rescue.
