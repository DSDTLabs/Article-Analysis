 Kharghar activist Monu Pal said, “In the last week, five strays were killed in sector 10 of Kharghar. This has alarmed us to look out for alternative solutions to save the strays. So, we have purchased 200 reflector collars in bulk from Delhi.” 
 
  The visibility on the roads is almost nil as the street lights were not working, the activist added. “Of late, there have been many hit-and-run cases where dogs have been killed. 
 
 Pal has teamed up with three other animal lovers, Deepika Garg, Richa Pal and Seema Pal Bhawal, to tag the reflector collars on dogs.
 
 A puppy was recently hit by a speeding car. The dog’s limb was fractured in the accident. 
 
 “The stray was treated for its fractured arm and is recovering. Following this incident, the animal lovers joined the move to attach the reflector collars on the stray dogs,” Pal added.
