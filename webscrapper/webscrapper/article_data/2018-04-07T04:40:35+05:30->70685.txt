MUMBAI: After almost a fortnight of clear air, the city's pollution levels plunged into the 'poor' category on Friday owing to changing wind patterns. According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality index recorded in Mumbai was 203 and the most polluted was   with an AQI of 404, which is considered severe. 

 The city's AQI on Thursday was 125, which is considered to be moderate. It has been in this range since March 26. 
 
 "As wind patterns change, a lot of moisture is introduced in the air and this results in higher pollution levels. In Malad, there could be increased activity around the monitoring station which could have caused the hike," said  , project director, SAFAR. "The AQI will remain in the 'poor' category for a day or two. It will be back to 'moderate' category when wind patterns stabilize." AQI is measured on the basis of the presence of particulate matter in the air. An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered poor and people sensitive to   may experience uneasiness.
