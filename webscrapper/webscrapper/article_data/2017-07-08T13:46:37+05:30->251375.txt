KOLKATA: A delegation of nine school heads, including minority institutions, met education minister   on Friday afternoon to discuss the problems they would be facing because of the new   on two compulsory exams in classes V and VIII. The meeting took place in the assembly house. 

 A section of delegates complained that the Council had also made it mandatory for all affiliated schools to follow the curriculum pre-school onwards, which was earlier left to the institutes as it allowed more flexibility.

 The programmes will have to be attended by all teachers and the school will be charged for it. We are also objecting to the mandatory training as that might put unnecessary pressure on them. The   might also be affected," said a principal.
 
 The team also pointed out that the time for co-curricular activities will also get shortened if students are subjected to more tests. 
 
 "The minister has assured us he would look into the matter and take it up with the council," said a source.
 
 Earlier on June 2, heads of at least 30   met and voiced their grievances about the council making arbitrary policies.

 The board will also prepare reports on every subject for individual students (it might be in the form of a comment and not marks) and hand them over to the council, school and parents.
 
 CISCE has also assured that the students will not require additional preparation for these exams, which will be aptitude-based. 
 
 The objective of these exams will be to check if the schools are following the prescribed curriculum to assess the success and weakness of the syllabus and shed light on
