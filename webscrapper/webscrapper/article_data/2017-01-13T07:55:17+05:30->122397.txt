AMARAVATI: The   national general secretary  ,  , will take shape in the capital city under the aegis of  . The trust has sought land from the government in the core capital city area for setting up the museum, which is expected to come up in 15-20 acres.

 Late chief minister NT Ramarao's granddaughter and Lokesh's wife Brahmani is overseeing the arrangements. A formal announcement on the museum is expected to be made on January 18 on the death anniversary of NTR. Interestingly, Lokesh visited several museums in Delhi and London a year ago with a view to coming up with a swanky design for the NTR museum.
 
 Lokesh had promised to construct the museum at NTR's hometown of Nimmakuru near Gudivada in Krishna district. However, failure to secure a suitable land prompted him to shift it to Amaravati.
 
 "Since it's a prestigious project, location of the museum assumes significance," a senior TDP leader close to Lokesh told TOI. He reasoned that Amaravati will be a better location because of better road connectivity. A beautiful park would also be developed within the museum. "The museum will provide an insight to the future generations about various services rendered by NTR to the poor," Lokesh told party leaders at a meeting on Thursday.
