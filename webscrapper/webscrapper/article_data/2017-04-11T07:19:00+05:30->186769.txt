MOHALI:   (NIA), which is probing the Pathankot terror attack, on Monday produced a list of 39 witnesses to be examined in the NIA court in Mohali.

 Additional sessions judge   issued summons to one Vimal Kumar Singh, as the first witness for his appearance in the next hearing in the case slated for May 2. The list was produced by NIA superintendent of police (SP) along with the agency’s standing counsel.
 
 “We have produced the list of 39 witnesses to be examined in the first phase and the court has allowed us to produce a supplementary list. The trial in the case has been formally initiated today,” an NIA official said. 
 
 The NIA counsel evaded a query on mention of Punjab Police’s suspended SP Salwinder Singh’s name in the first list. 
 
 On January 2, 2016, a heavily armed group had attacked the Pathankot Air Force Station. Five attackers and three security personnel had died in the gunbattle and subsequent combning operation of the airbase. Three defence personnel had succumbed to their injuries in hospital, raising the death toll of defence personnel to six.
 
 After NIA took charge of the investigation, it had conducted searches at five places, including the residences and office of SP Salwinder, who was then posted at Gurdaspur, and his friends.
