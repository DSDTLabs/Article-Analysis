LUCKNOW: The seizure of 156 kg of turtle calipee in the last week by UP special task force (STF) has raised concern about the new type of illegal trade. Calipee is found next to a turtle’s lower shell and is sold at exorbitant rates in Southeast Asian countries.

 STF had seized three calipee consignments from Kanpur. ASP, STF, Arvind   said that international law enforcement agency, South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN), is organising a meet in Siliguri, West Bengal, from April 22-25 on illegal trade of turtles where a session on calipee trade of UP has also been planned for the first time.
 
 Four countries — Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Burma — involved in the trade will also take part. Calipee trade is a new and thriving business with chains connected from West Bengal to  . ASP Chaturvedi added that Saleem Shaikh, who was arrested with 27 kg calipee, confessed that the soft shell calipee had been cut, dried and trafficked through Etawah, Etah, Mainpuri, Auraiya and Farrukhabad and then smuggled through Bangladesh to China, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
 
 The calipee from India is sold for $1,000 per kg. Most traders are from West Bengal who pay a petty amount to fishermen and members of nomadic tribe ‘Kanjar’ for catching turtles from Ganga plains. Additional director, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, Tilottama Verma, said that concerted efforts by us, UP STF, CID and forest departments of West Bengal are curbing calipee trade.
 
  and STF officials said that the channel of calipee trade consisting of poacher-local trader-West Bengal trader and then international smuggler is being studied and a strategy to break it is being devised. Efforts are on to establish a network with Bangladesh government and increase vigil in Bangoan, the border area of West Bengal from where the calipee is carried to Bangladesh.
