PANAJI: The issue of open spaces slowly disappearing in rapidly urbanized areas figured at a   panchayat gram sabha on Sunday with a member suggesting that a comunidade-owned space at   be converted into a park.

 The member said that Serula comunidade had already issued a no objection certificate to build a park in the open space adjacent to the Socorro panchayat, but it is now being used as a car park. Sarpanch Sandeep   who chaired the meeting assured members that they would examine the matter and approach the government.
 
 Another member   told TOI that he had submitted a proposal to discuss illegal structures that have sprouted in some open spaces, but it was not taken up. However, the sarpanch assured him that they would look into the matter.
 
 The gram sabha also discussed development issues and a resolution suggesting that the premises of a government primary school at Socorro, which has less than a dozen students, be allotted to the panchayat to set up a gymnasium and recreational facilities was taken up.
 
 Members expressed interest in developing a joggers park and a football ground. 
 
 Members also pointed out that some houses in the village have been rented out, but these are in turn used to accommodate tourists, who create nuisance when inebriated. It was suggested that professional tax be collected from such houses. 
 
 Vazarkar said that he would contact the police for information about tenants and initiate steps accordingly.
 
 Vazarkar also informed members that the work of broadening roads due to increase in traffic is in progress and sought their cooperation, stating some are obstructing the work.
