NEW DELHI: Tough and focussed senior advocate   on Monday crossed the line while arguing for an independent probe into judicial officer B H Loya’s death, only to be quickly reprimanded by the  , which forced her to say ‘sorry’. 

 Jaising vehemently protested Maharashtra counsel Harish Salve’s request to the court that though the state was ready to share all documents relating to Loya’s death with counsel for parties, it should be for their eyes only and not be circulated among the media. 
 
 Salve’s intention was to to save the four district judges, two of whom have since been appointed as judges of Bombay HC, the embarrassment of being discussed in public for their statements that Loya’s death was natural and there was no foul play or suspicious circumstances attached to it. 
 
 Jaising said the request smacked of the intention to “gag” the press. Senior advocate   belligerently said the documents would be discussed in public even as one of the judges on the three-judge bench led by the CJI wondered how a subjudice matter would be discussed in public.
 
 Jaising said, “The Supreme Court cannot gag the press just days after holding that right to free speech and expression was paramount while allowing countrywide release of ‘Padmaavat’. How can the SC prevent expression of free speech in Loya case?” 
 
 A visibly annoyed CJI took umbrage to the line of argument and told Jaising, “Have we passed an order gagging the press? Have we uttered a single word on Salve’s submission? Can’t we discuss among ourselves an argument put forth by a senior advocate? Why did you imagine that we will gag the press and then made those submissions? You must withdraw your argument, say sorry and never ever do it again.” 
 
 Chastised, Jaising withdrew her argument about gagging the press and said sorry.
