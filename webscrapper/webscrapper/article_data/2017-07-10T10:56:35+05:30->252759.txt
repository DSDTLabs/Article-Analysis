THRISSUR: The stance taken by   that   would be allowed to sell only at Rs 87 per kilogram in the state would lead to closing down of all   in Kerala and the state would become fully dependent on Tamil Nadu for chicken, said the   (PFTC) here on Sunday. The   alleged that Isaac was favouring the poultry industry in Tamil Nadu. 

 According to PFTC president Binni Emmatty, the minister's demand would create a situation where the entire poultry farms in Kerala would have to be closed down, and the state would become fully dependent on Tamil Nadu for chicken. "The consumers here will then have to purchase chicken at the rates dictated by the poultry industry in Tamil Nadu," he said.
 
 Emmatty is also the treasurer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Samithi (KVVS) led by CPM MLA VKC Mohammed Koya. CPM leader M V Govindan Master is the patron of that organization.
 
 The PFTC leaders said they would try to meet chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to resolve the stalemate.
 
 Emmatty pointed out that the prices of chicken in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka was being fixed by the business coordination council of respective states. "About eight lakh people are employed in the poultry sector in the state, and the finance minister's stance is a challenge to them and to the consumers of the state as a whole," he said.
 
 According to him on Sunday the retail price of chicken in Tamil Nadu is Rs 150 and Rs 160 in Karnataka. Even the public sector Meat Products of India (MPI) is selling chicken for Rs 230 per kg, whereas Kerala State Poultry Development Corporation (Kepco) is selling it at Rs 158 per kg. "So there is no justification in asking the poultry traders to sell chicken at Rs 87 per kilogram," Emmatty said.
