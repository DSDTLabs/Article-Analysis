NASHIK: Maharashtra Rajya   on Friday staged a demonstration against the proposed Mumbai-Nagpur  . They also launched a ‘janjagaran’ rally from Nagpur to Mumbai.

 The Maharashtra Rajya Kisan Sabha has organised the rally along with the   against Samruddhi and labourers’ union. 
 
 The rally began simultaneously from three places — Hingne in Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik. During the rally, protesters will spread awareness as to why the government’s decision on Samruddhi is wrong and how it will affect project affected  . The rally will also visit all project-affected villages across the state.
 
 Raju Desle, Maharashtra Rajya Kisan Sabha’s state secretary, said, “Farmers have already opposed the proposed expressway. All political parties are also against the proposed expressway project. The government is going ahead with its dream project, which will affect thousands of farmers.”
 
 “Earlier, the Mumbai-Nagpur four-lane project was planned and land was also acquired for this. But, only a two-lane Mumbai-Nagpur highway was constructed. This should have been developed as a four-lane project. The government is instead developing another Mumbai-Nagpur expressway named Samruddhi,” Desle said.
 
 Desale said that the proposed Samruddhi eway passes via the Nashik district’s Igatpuri tehsil. “Several acres of farmland in Igatpuri have been acquired for various government projects. Of the total 1.26 lakh hectares, only 26,000 hectares of agricultural land remain in Igatpuri. This project will badly affect the remaining farmers,” he said.
 
 The state is developing the Samruddhi Expressway via Nashik and Marathwada. The 793-km expressway will pass through 14 districts, including Nashik. Chief minister   has already said that the first phase will be finished by 2019 and the project will be ready by December 2020.
