NEW DELHI: Family members of the 21-year-old DU student, who hanged herself on Monday evening after repeated threats from her  , said that they had gone to Roop Nagar   station in north Delhi six days before she killed herself. 

 However, the cops there told them that the man would be called to Delhi and asked to compromise.
 
 “My sister was depressed for the last three months. We made her understand that this was not the end of the world and that she deserves better things in life. But as soon as she started getting better, her boyfriend did something to upset her and she again slipped into depression,” said the girl’s brother.
 
 The family alleged that cops failed to respond even after five days of their  . 
 
 “When we approached the cops again, a woman constable took us to Model Town police station and a rape case was registered. I feel my sister had already lost hope by then as she hanged herself the next day,” the victim’s brother added. A senior police officer said that an inquiry has been started into the matter.
 
 “My sister was very ambitious, but she lately stopped studying for the UPSC exams. Her boyfriend started ignoring and threatening her after coming to know of her caste,” he added.
 
 DCW on Thursday issued notice to Delhi Police over its inaction in the suicide and demanded reasons for its inaction on the inital complaints made by the girl.
