Margao: Irked that authorities have not given due importance to Swacch Bharat Abhiyan through proper maintenance of pay-and-use toilets in the city, a Margao-based NGO has petitioned governor Mridula Sinha, ambassador for the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan, to intervene in the matter.

 Savio Coutinho, convener of   for Margao (SCM), has attempted to direct Sinha’s attention to ‘the issue of open defecation due to the pitiable state of Margao’s public toilets constructed by various government agencies and maintained by Sulabh Sauchalaya International.’
 
 For over 20 days, SCM had also conducted a similar awareness programme, urging vendors and traders at South Goa Planning and Development Authority market to utilize the newly-constructed toilet in the premises instead of urinating in the public. “SCM feels the government should also work out modalities to provide free use of urinals not only in Margao but in the entire state,” Coutinho said.
