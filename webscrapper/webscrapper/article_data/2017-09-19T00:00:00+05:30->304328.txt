When the   of India initiated an award ceremony to fete talents from the technical divisions of filmmaking in 2016, producer-director Shankar Gowda and his partners at   — Vinod Gowda and Shankar Reddy — were intrigued. “I was thrilled when I first heard about a platform to celebrate technicians. So, when the second edition of the event was announced, I wanted to be a part of it, as I believe that   are the backbone of the film industry. Vinod and Shankar share my views on this,” says Shankar, production house is associated with the Times Kannada Film Technical Awards (Times  ), presented by  .
The fact that there are 17 categories this time around, up from the 13 in 2016, is a positive sign, says Shankar, who hopes that the awards will get bigger and better with every passing year, to include many more categories and recognize the contributions of every individual on a film set. “Once technicians realize that their work is being appreciated, their involvement in a project will be far more. So, far, award ceremonies have been only about actors and principal crew and now that there is one for others as well, they will truly feel encouraged,” says the filmmaker.
