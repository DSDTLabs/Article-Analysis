The   conducts random checks in different districts to check on issues related to voter lists ahead of every assembly election. Another team of the ECI will also check the state administrationâ€™s preparedness for election-related I-T usage. The ECI usually conducts electoral roll verification process three months ahead of the elections, but the visits to Gujarat more than four months in advance has raised eyebrows and led to speculation about early elections.
