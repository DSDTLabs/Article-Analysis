Around 75 houses are still coming in right of way of the  , and it may take longer, much more than a month, to remove these hurdles before   can start work on this long-pending road project.

 Sources in   have claimed there has been some ‘miscommunication’ in briefing highways minister   on the status of the expressway. 
 
 Speaking at the TOI Town Hall, the Union minister claimed only 24 structures were left to be removed and that the work on the thoroughfare would start in a month time, kindling hope among thousands of homebuyers who have moved into residential projects along the 17km-long stretch.
 
 “Most of the structures, excluding those of   (general power of attorney) holders and SPA (special power of attorney) holders, have been demolished. But the fate of GPA, SPA properties — most of which are in New Palam Vihar — is to be decided by court,” said a senior Huda official. The high court is to hear a case related to GPA and SPA holders on April 26 again.
 
 Around 568 oustees from New Palam Vihar and Kherki Daula had applied for alternative plots but only 223 of them were found eligible for the same as per the Huda’s rehabilitation policy. Huda has already given allotment letters to 148 out of the 223 oustees. The remaining 75 GPA and SPA holders are still waiting for alternative plots.
 
 “All the people who had registry were given alternative plots, and they have moved out of this place. There houses have been or are bring demolished. But 75 families with GPA and SPA are stilling staying here,” said Sanjay Kumar, one of the GPA holders from New Palam Vihar.
 
 These apart, there are 14 other obstacles — temples, towers carrying high-tension power transmission lines, culverts etc. — that are yet to be removed. Acquisition of 10 hectares for building   (CPR), which will connect the expressway with NH-8 near Kherki Daula, is still pending. Also, a huge farmhouse is blocking the expressway in Sector 109 and officials are still discussing the issue.
