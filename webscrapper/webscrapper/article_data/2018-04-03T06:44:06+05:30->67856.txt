DARJEELING: Ropeway operators in Darjeeling shut services on Monday owing to non-renewal of the lease agreement between Conveyor and   ( ) that operates the ropeway and West Bengal Forest Development Corporation Limited ( ). 

 The ropeway near  , a popular tourist destination, had to bear the brunt of two phases of statehood agitation in 2013 and in 2017 when it was forced to shut for 104 days. It was reopened in January this year.
 
 A CRSL official said on Sunday a letter WBFDCL wrote to the operator asking it to close operations as the twenty-year lease had expired on March 31, 2018. "We have been directed to close operations until it is renewed," he said. The official said the operational lease agreement with WBFDCL was for twenty years, but due to various reasons like political unrests and a fatal accident in 2003, it could operate for only ten years.
 
 Several tourists on Monday returned dejected.   from Beliaghata in Kolkata said, "My children were really excited to take the ropeway ride. But the gate was closed and we were told that it was a lease agreement issue." 
 
 CRSL officials said talks were in progress to extend the lease and resume operations soon.
