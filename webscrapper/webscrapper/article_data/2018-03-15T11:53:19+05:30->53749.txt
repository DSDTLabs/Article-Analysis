NAGPUR: Shanti Nagar corporator Abha Pande has asked the municipal commissioner to provide a GPS tracking watch to every doctor at the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) centre. This, according to her, will ensure that doctors diligently follow their duty charts.

 Patients visiting the centre at Shanti Nagar near Mudliar Square are unable to meet the doctors who are very irregular.
 
 According to Pande, the NMC’s health department had deputed three doctors — Dr  , Dr Salim Fajlani and Dr Priti Bhoyar (gynaecologist) — to run the health centre. According to her, though they have been assigned a duty chart, the three are very irregular.
 
 The doctors are expected to be present by 8am according to the information board at the entrance of the hospital. In their absence, the non-medical staff of   is often seen prescribing medicines to patients, which is illegal.
 
 Following complaints from patients, Pande went on a surprise inspection on Wednesday. She did not find the doctors at the appointed time. Medical officer Dr Katore punched in at 9.45am while her scheduled time was 8am. Similarly, paediatrician Dr Fajlani, who is the main authority for the Children’s Care Centre, entered the hospital at 10am.
 
 Patients say that the staff members are punctual but the doctors keep them waiting for at least two hours.
 
 Like the sanitary workers, even the doctors should be monitored with the help of GPS trackers, according to Pande. “It will make them behave with responsibility and patients will not have to suffer,” she added.
