I begin the day with yoga and meditation. It’s difficult to do anything unless I take care of what is going on internally. Having a ritual is important. I cannot stress enough to my students and loved ones how much it helps to have one ritual in the morning.

 It develops the tools we need to function in this chaotic world. I believe that most successful people have a ritual. And they don’t budge from it. 
 I wake up every morning about the same time, at 4.45 am. After doing yoga for a short while, I meditate for 45 min to an hour. Then I go for a run or a hike, or something that will make me sweat. If I do all of this before 8 am, I know my day is going to be incredible. I feel pretty good about what my body has done for itself. 
 
 I try not to check emails or my phone before any of this happens. How you wake up is how you show up. Remember that we all live on a blue planet that circles around a ball of fire, next to a moon that moves the sea... 
 
 In short, one wrong foot early can have a domino effect and spoil your whole day.
