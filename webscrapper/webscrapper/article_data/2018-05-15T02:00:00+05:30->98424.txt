PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) conducted an anti-encroachment drive at the   and seized at least 50 chairs, five carts and one makeshift food counter on Monday.

 Maurya Lok — one of the largest and most popular commercial hubs of the city — is located at the heart of Patna near the Dak Bungalow crossing. It houses around 300 shops, 100 central and state government offices as well as the headquarters of the PMC. Three food buses also operate on the premises of the complex.
 
 “The problem arises when food counters and trucks start crossing the area given to them at Maurya Lok. Many a time, they also encroach the parking area,” PMC deputy municipal commissioner Vishal Anand said.
 
 The open spaces inside the complex, which were originally planned to be developed as green spaces, are now being occupied by vehicles. This, in turn, creates problems for pedestrians.
 
 Maurya Lok Shopkeepers’ Welfare Association president Rajesh Kumar Dabloo told this reporter the drive should have been carried out in the evening when most of the hawkers set up their shops
 
 Vishal said similar surprise anti-encroachment drives would be carried out from time to time.
