AMRITSAR: The absence of BJP MP late Vinod Khanna has put the BJP in a tight spot for finding a suitable candidate for the Gurdaspur   byelection, scheduled to be held on October 11. For now, the party is weighing its best options.

 Sources say the BJP is looking at the demographic profile of the parliamentary constituency, which has a considerable population of Rajputs, and could consider fielding a member from the community. “Our top candidate, Swaran Singh Salaria, is a Rajput and a Mumbai-based businessman who hails from Chohan village of   district,” said sources in the BJP. “During the 2014 general elections, the party took 39 days to decide between the candidature of Vinod Khanna and  ,” the sources said.
 
 Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency has over 2.75 lakh ex-servicemen and Rajputs who could lend their support to Salaria. “I have been active in the area for over a decade and was made in charge of both Lok Sabha and assembly elections,” Salaria told TOI.
 
 “Being a local, I understand the issues better than any outsider,” he said and added that Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency requires an industrial package.
 
 BJP secretary   said the announcement of the candidate will be made in a couple of days. “We all are moving in the constituency to know the pulse of people and will soon announce our candidate,” he said.
