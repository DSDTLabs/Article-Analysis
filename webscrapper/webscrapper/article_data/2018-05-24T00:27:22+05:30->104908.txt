Thiruvananthapuram: A get-together of schizophrenia patients and their families will be held at   on Thursday. The get-together is being organized by the health department and the NGO Manasa, which is working for patients affected with schizophrenia.

 Discussion on setting up of a rehabilitation scheme for the patients will be the main aim of the get-together. The occasion will also provide a platform to share their treatment experiences and difficulties. The doctors who treated them will also be attending the function which will begin at 10am. 
 
 Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that usually appears in late adolescence or early adulthood. Characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and other cognitive difficulties, schizophrenia can often be a lifelong struggle. Common symptoms include unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. 
 
 As the recovery is gradual, the disease will give tiring times to patients and immediate relatives. “By sharing their experiences and listening to success stories of others, affected patients and relatives can gather more confidence and optimism for dealing with the crisis,” said one of the organizers.
