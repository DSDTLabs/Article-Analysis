HYDERABAD: The day the beacon ban came into effect, it was netas who were first to circumvent the rule. What was witnessed at Panjagutta on Monday was a glaring example. Speaking to TOI, an eye witness said, "Initially, I thought it was an ambulance trying to make way and I swerved towards the left, but soon I realised it was actually a politician’s car. The beacon was not flashing, but the driver kept the siren on.”

 The blaring siren was kept on for five minutes before the car eventually sped away at the signal towards Ameerpet.
 
 Even at the Telangana government nerve centre, Secretariat, an  , a government vehicle, parked near   was seen still sporting a beacon. However, it was covered. Ironically, the vehicle (AP09 CW 4418) belongs to the director,  , department of protocol, which is supposed to set an example by implementing the ban.
 
 The Union government had on April 19 scrapped use of beacons, dubbing it as a step to abolish VIP culture, but did not mention anything about sirens. Many VIPs were seen using sirens near road junctions, extracting green channel from the traffic police.
 
 Much before the ban announcement, chief minister and TRS chief   and his son and IT minister   had stopped using the beacons atop their official vehicles. Some ministers for photo-ops had personally removed beacons, but they found a way out in the form of sirens. As ministers are eligible for pilot vehicles (police vehicles), drivers use sirens on busy roads for traffic clearance.
