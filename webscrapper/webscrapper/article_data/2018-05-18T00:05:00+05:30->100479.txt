Vinod Ravindranâ€™s popular play, 
 , is back on stage. Slated to take place at Shoonya, Centre For Art And Somatic Practices (on May 19) and Butterfly Talent Academy (on May 20), the latest show is a performance for children, featuring Rency Philip, Shweta Desai, Anirudh Mahesh and Vinod.

  Hell breaks loose on the peaceful farm when  , the cow, gets cranky. She yells and scolds and rants and raves sending all the other animals into a tizzy. So, much so that the farmer is forced to do some quick thinking to solve the problem. 
 
  
  uses storytelling, live music, puppets, objects and imagery to tell the story of travel, adventure and companionship. Set in a wonderful world that stretches far beyond a typical farm, the play, with its non-judgmental tone and openness allows children to interpret the performance in several ways.
