Vadodara: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) filed another affidavit opposing bail application of scam-tained Sumandeep Vidyapeeth founder Mansukh Shah arrested for running cash-for-marks racket.

 The new affidavit filed in the sessions court on Monday states that despite charity commissioner’s order that the fees from students should not be taken in cash, Shah continued to do so. The order was passed after KM Shah Charitable Trust, where Shah was the managing trustee, became Sumandeep Vidyapeeth Trust in 2006.
 
 It reveals executive role of Shah in the university which was so far being denied by his lawyer. ACB stated that in 2004, Shah had applied to the University Grants Commission (UGC) for establishing deemed university in the capacity of managing trustee of K M Shah Charitable Trust. “In the balance sheet of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth, Shah was shown as managing trustee,” the affidavit stated.
 
 The affidavit also stated that on many occasions Shah has mentioned his designation as managing trustee of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth. Apart from this, Shah and his son have signed as authorized signatories of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth and income tax returns are being filed through his signatures, the affidavit said. ACB also said that all transactions of university are being done through the account, which is in name of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth and the transactions are carried out by signatures of Shah and his son.
 
 After the agency filed the affidavit, Shah’s lawyer requested the court to give another date so that they can respond after studying it. The court of principal district and sessions judge J C Doshi will hear further arguments on April 3.
 
 In the previous affidavit filed on March 21, it was stated the call detail records of Shah and his aide Vinod alias Bharat Savant show that the duo were in constant touch with each other before and after the trap.
