PANAJI: The cities of  , Pune and Rajkot are among the finalists competing with cities from 22 other countries for the National and Global Winner’s title in WWF’s One Planet City Challenge.

 Promoting sustainable transport and mobility,   on Sunday as part of WWF-India’s Give Up to Give Back initiative, took pledges to give up unsustainable practices and introduce lifestyle changes, including walking, cycling and carpooling.
 
 Citizens also participated in a cyclothon endorsed by Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) mayor Vithal Chopdekar. “CCP understands the need for walking and cycling spaces in the city as part of the   initiative. We will encourage this initiative and request more citizens, especially children, to contribute to this cause that will make our city pollution-free,” he said.
 
 With a high car ownership density, sustainable mobility is the need of the hour for Panaji and by 2019, the city is aiming to reduce community-level emissions by 19% from the 2013 levels, with a strong focus on expanding its sustainable mobility infrastructure and raising awareness.
 
 Suchismita Mukhopadhyay, associate director at  , said it was important for citizens to make smart mobility choices in their daily lives. “Simple individual lifestyle choices such as taking public transport, cycling and walking for shorter trips or even carpooling can help decongest the roads, reduce pollution and address climate change,” she said.
