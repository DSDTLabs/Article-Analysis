German companies have invested 1.2 billion euros in India in 2017 alone, says German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in an exclusive interview with TOI’s Indrani Bagchi on the eve of his visit to India. His visit will take him to Varanasi and Chennai apart from holding discussions with Prime Minister   and President  . Excerpts:

 
 
 • It took an unusually long time to form a government. It is therefore good news that a stable government has now taken office and commenced work. All around us, liberal democracies are being put to the test. It is our conviction that Germany’s success and reputation are based on liberal policies at home and good neighbourly relations with all countries. Germany has a lot to offer India in terms of technology for sustainable mobility and supply of energy.
 
 
 
 • Our volume of trade has tripled in the past 10 years. 1,800 German companies have created over 4,00,000 jobs in India. German firms have invested 1.2 billion euros in India in the past year alone: automotive engineering, energy, infrastructure, smart city projects. I will be accompanied on my trip to India by German business representatives, drawn above all from small- and medium-sized enterprises. However, in spite of these positive developments, everyone involved feels they are still being held back. We should therefore work at all levels to bring the India-EU trade agreement rapidly to a successful conclusion.
 
 
 
 • Our cooperation is conceived for the long term. Back in the year 2000, Germany and India launched a strategic partnership. As a result, our Cabinets meet regularly – an engagement we have entered into with very few countries outside Europe. PM   visited Germany twice last year. We want to expand this exchange on both practical matters and strategic issues. My state visit to India will also serve this aim. India’s dynamic economic and social development presents excellent opportunities for us to deepen our cooperation. An inherent part of this, as I see it, is considering how we want to and how we are able to present a concerted response to the challenges of globalisation.
 
 
 
 • Given the dynamism of the powerful economies in Asia, we have a growing interest in an open and safe  , through which a large part of German trade flows move. As the host country of the   for the Law of the Sea, Germany has a particular interest in an international order based on binding law. India and Germany’s interests in this question are very similar and we would like to enhance our cooperation with India and with all interested states.
 
 
 
 • India has become ever more important to us, as regards finding answers to global problems, future of free trade, combating climate change and implementing the SDGs we adopted together in the  . Worth special mention is our trailblazing cooperation on renewable energies, in particular in the field of solar technology. But I am not interested in closer economic cooperation alone. Our two democracies are called upon to defend their values anew each day. Preserving our pluralism and openness is far from easy, and does not go unchallenged in the present day and age. We want to reawaken Germans’ interest in India as a whole, and find out more about India’s ideas for the future.
