PANAJI: The proposed 880-metre-long bridge connecting the island of Chorao (Tiswadi) to Salvador do   (Bardez) will be built by M   private limited at a cost of Rs 147.31 crore. 

 The specialized steel arch bridge has been approved by the Union ministry of road transport and highways and will be funded through central funds, sources said. Though the bridge is expected to take three years to be built, construction is not expected to commence till the land acquisition formalities are completed, government officials privy to the matter said.
 
 The two-lane bridge will have a 476-metre-long approach road built on Salvador do Mundo and a 314- metre-long approach road on Chorao, close to the   bird sanctuary.
 
 According to the detailed project report for the bridge, mangroves extensively present on both banks of the river, near the approach roads, required cutting. 
 
 “The government approval has been conveyed by the finance department along with the requisite NOC from the captain of ports and Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority. Land filling will not be done on Salvador do Mundo side to avoid excessive destruction of mangroves,” an official said.
 
 The Public Works Department will have to acquire 82,385 sq m of land for the proposed bridge, including 30,000 sq mt and 52,400 sq m on Chorao and Salvador do Mundo in Bardez taluka respectively.
 
 “Total cost of land procurement is estimated at Rs 22 crore,” a source said.
 
 With political equations changing in Porvorim, administrators in the state are hopeful that the new found bonhomie between   MLA Rohan Khaunte and chief minister Manohar Parrikar will help resolve the land acquisition woes for the bridge. The tender for the bridge was floated on December 16 and the bids were opened on December 31.
