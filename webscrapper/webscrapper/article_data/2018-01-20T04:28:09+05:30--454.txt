MUMBAI: A 64-year-old accountant with a firm at Santacruz (W) owned by MLC Amrish Patel was found   on the   near Mira Road on Friday.

 C A Kutty was at the office of Deesan Texfab, a fabric manufacturer, when income-tax ( ) officers were searching the premises. He walked out around 3pm, saying he would return in a few minutes. His body was found on the tracks between Mira Road and Bhayander railway stations. Railway police have registered an accidental death case and are checking if he ended his life. 
 
 The incident comes in the wake of searches at the premises of Patel, his family, relatives and associates over the last three days. Patel is associated with Shri Vile Parle Kelvani Mandal, which runs educational institutions, including Mithibai College and NM College at Vile Parle (W) and other places. Patel also has a strong base in Dhule.
 
 At Shirpur, in Dhule district, Maharashtra, I-T officers were manhandled while searching the house of a Patel associate and Congress leader identified as P Chavan. It is alleged that Chavan’s kin misbehaved with a female officer and took away some documents in the midst of the search. A huge crowd had gathered outside Chavan’s house on learning about the IT operation. Chavan’s kin allegedly took advantage of the distraction and walked out with important documents. “On the IT officials’ complaint, we have registered a police case under Indian Penal Code sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty) and 354 (molestation) against Chavan and his associates,” said M Ramkumar, superintendent of police, Dhule.
 
 Patel’s relative Tapan confirmed Kutty’s death, adding that he was with the firm for 35 years. Railway police recorded Kutty’s son’s statement and sent the body for post-mortem. A railway official said a motorman told the station master a body was on the tracks, after which police shifted it to hospital.
