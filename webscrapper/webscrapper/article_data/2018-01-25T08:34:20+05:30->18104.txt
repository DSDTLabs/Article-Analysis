BENGALURU: Medical education minister   on Wednesday met   in the hope of ending the ongoing controversy over the government demanding that the   (RGUHS) transfer Rs 580crore from its   for the construction of the campus and health city in  . 

 The governor had, on January 17, written to the government not to pressure the university to transfer funds and find a resolution in the Karnataka high court, where the matter is pending. The government has, time and again, pressured the university to transfer the funds, which the latter’s Syndicate and Senate have been opposing.
 
 The varsity had written to Vala seeking his intervention late last year, replying to which he had told the varsity to not transfer any funds until his communication, and his January 17 letter was to put an end to the issue.
 
 However, Patil told TOI: “I’ve explained the situation to the governor and he told me that he will get back after examining the matter.” The governor had, on January 4, written to chief minister Siddaramaiah, asking the government to obtain a clarification from the high court before moving forward.
 
 “It is brought to my notice by the RGUHS V-C that government orders have been issued to transfer an amount of Rs 580crore from the university, in exercise of powers under Section 40 of the Act. It is also brought to my notice that the university had taken a decision not to transfer the said amount of the university. Contrary to the same, the aforesaid government order has been issued,” Vala had said in his letter.
 
 Sources in the university said that they will stick to the decision of not transferring the money.
