BENGALURU: The state government has sought permission of the   to transfer   deputy commissioner Rohini   Dasari and three other IAS officers in addition to a couple of IPS officials. 

  Sources said the   is yet to clear the transfer orders. This is the second time in recent times that the government is trying to transfer Sindhuri from Hassan district. Sources added that the government had also sent the names of Bengaluru Urban (V Shankar) Mysuru (D Randeep) and Vijayapura (K B Shivakumar) for transfers as they had completed two to three years in the same district. 
 
 Sindhuri's earlier transfer on January 23, a fortnight before the Mahamastakabishekha was to commence, was stayed by the Election Commission because the revision of electoral rolls was on and officers cannot be transferred during this period. With the final voters' list released on February 28 and Mahamastakabishekha concluding, the government again decided to transfer her.
 
  Sindhuri has been issued a show-cause notice by the government and her explanation sought for not being present to receive and see off CM Siddaramaiah, when he was in Shravanabelagola for the commencement of the event on February 7. 
 
 Protocol stipulates that the district deputy commissioner and superintendent of police be present when the CM is around.
