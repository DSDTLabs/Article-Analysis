AHMEDABAD:   has cancelled a   by a family court in Surat on   of the husband by his wife.

 The HC quashed the dissolution of marriage by holding that the gesture by a man to drive his wife out of matrimonial home and to ensure that she lives separately does not create a ground of desertion.
 
 The case involves a   from Surat, who got married in May 2009. The wife left her husband in August that year. The husband moved the court for dissolution of marriage on ground of desertion by wife for more than two years. He had claimed that the wife stayed for 15 days only with him after their marriage. The family court decreed a divorce in February 2017. The wife questioned this before the HC on the ground that the family court did not take her version into consideration and accepted the husband’s claims as gospel truth.
 
 The woman told the HC that she suspected that her husband had an extra-marital affair and whenever she used to inquire, the husband started beating her and threatened to drive her out of the matrimonial house. She was forced to leave, and the husband was determined in not accepting her back.The woman also told the HC that her husband refused to reconcile and reside with her and to take her to the matrimonial home. The husband argued that he had sent a notice to his wife asking him to come and cohabit a few days before filing for the divorce.
 
 After hearing the case, a bench of Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice A Y Kogje questioned the man’s gesture of sending legal notice to his wife seeking cohabitation. The court observed that after sending such a notice, the man should have requested the court for restitution of conjugal rights. 
 
 “On one hand, the husband created a situation for the wife to reside separately, on the other, no effort was made to bring back the wife into the matrimonial fold thereby creating an artificial ground of desertion,” the court said while cancelling the divorce.
