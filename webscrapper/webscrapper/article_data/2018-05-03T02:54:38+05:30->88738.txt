NEW DELHI: The   will   Dyal Singh College (Evening) to be   and will take action against its management committee for doing so without consent, HRD minister Prakash   said on Wednesday.

 “I want to clearly state that the name of Dyal Singh College will not change. There is no question of any change and neither will any permission be given. If there are two Dyal Singh colleges, the management may name them as Dyal Singh 1 and 2 or A and B or even morning or evening. But any attempt to change the name of the college by the management committee is unacceptable and strict action will be initiated,” said Javadekar.
 
 The minister’s comments came following reports that the management had quietly renamed the college with banners of ‘Vande Mataram Dyal Singh College’ being put up.
