Director   has penned a seven-page letter in Tamil to actor   with regard to him contesting in the Producer’s Council  . Here are the excerpts from the letter which translates to…

 “Dear Vishal, what happened to you? You were doing well in the beginning, but what happened now? You have taken this Nadigar Sangam President to your head and now things are out of control. You became the President of a union which has hardly 3,000 people.   did a lot of hard work for the same. Can we ask Ritheesh to speak about it? And what did you do after coming to power? You have only given them Pongal and Diwali special bonus?
 
 Have you done a single film that educated or created awareness among the audience? You have only been dancing for dappankuthu numbers and taking advantage of audience’s intelligence. You have no right to question the state of Tamil Nadu politics. This is a rare disease that you’ve got and you should consult a doctor.
