CHENNAI: Crew members on board an   from Chennai to Kolkata on Tuesday morning experienced a few tense moments as a passenger developed seizures before a doctor on board provided timely help.

 Just as flight 6E-987 was about to take off from Chennai, a passenger in the back row suddenly developed seizures, but co-passengers could not understand what was happening.
 
 Dr  , an oncologist who was on the same flight, moved swiftly to help. “The passenger was biting his tongue and had seizures. There was no available medical history.

The on-ground medical team was far away as the aircraft was parked away from the terminal,” said the 29-year-old attached to the Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre in Porur.
 
 With help from the cabin crew, Sreyes quickly administered an intramuscular injection, and, within 15 minutes, the patient was stabilised, he said.

Observing his condition, the crew immediately informed the captain-in-command who alerted the Airport Operation Control Centre (AOCC) to arrange for medical assistance and to provide for an ambulance at the airport.
