AHMEDABAD: Eleven years after a dispute over the alleged   Ltd reached the  , a bench headed by   completed hearings on Tuesday and reserved its decision.

 In 2007, two PILs were filed in the high court contending that the club’s management had encroached on nearly 12,000 square metre government land. The petitioner had sought directions from the court to the   (AMC) and the state government for the demolition of the alleged illegal construction put up on this land, including the Golden Glory Hall.
 
 The issue even reached the Supreme Court after the high court mooted a proposal that the club pay an amount 2.5 times the market rate to the government and regularize the constructions. The petitioners objected to this interim directions by the high court for conditional regularization and unsuccessfully approached the apex court in January 2016.
 
 During the hearing in the high court, the club’s advocates submitted that the land was purchased from previous possessor through an agreement and therefore it was not an encroachment on government land.
 
 On part of the petitioners, advocate R C Jani submitted that the high court order for regularization on the payment of 2.5 times the market value can only be computed after ascertaining the market value. He said that jantri rates alone could not help establish the value and therefore a public auction should be held to ascertain the amount according to various orders of the Supreme Court and high courts. He also submitted that the club values the land at Rs 264 crore, but the real price is higher if computed at market rate.
 
 I H Syed, an advocate for another litigant, argued that the alleged encroachment by the club cannot be regularized at all because the club’s agreement with the previous occupier was invalid, since it was a New Tenure land. He said the construction came up despite various notices by the civic body and the issuance of prohibitory orders.
