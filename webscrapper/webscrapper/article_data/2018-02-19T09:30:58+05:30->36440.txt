KOCHI: The strike launched by trawler owners has led to a shortage of many popular fishes. Fish stall owners said that they have already run out of perch, squid, mackerels, sardines and ribbon fish. 

 "Exporters have large and expensive storage facilities so these fishes can last for a few days. I have already run out of perch, squid, sardines and ribbon fish. River fishes such as pearl spot, milkfish, and prawns, which will be available in the market during this protest, will be in demand. So their prices are likely to shoot up," said K A Anwar, who sells fish at Vypeen fish market.
 
 Over the past few day, the protest against the action taken by the fisheries department against those catching juvenile fishes in Munambam has been going on. The last stocks of deep sea fishes have begun to run out among traders.
 
 Mathew Joseph, founder of 'Freshtohome.com' said: "This protest will become a crisis if fishes that were available during the trawling season is not made available to traders. They will end up importing fishes from neighbouring states. Most suppliers don't have the infrastructure to transport fishes over large distances. In order to do so, they will start adding preservatives. Furthermore, traders exporting fishes will also face a crisis as they are unable to meet orders."
 
 Meanwhile, president of   Malsyathozhilali Aikya Vedi Charles George said that government should not yield to this protest conducted by fishermen and boat owners.
 
 "For many years, during the trawling season, Kerala has survived without perch, mackerels, sardines and ribbon fish. This situation created by the protest is similar. The government took a decision against trawling smaller fishes after consulting with the fishermen community, boat owners and CMFRI. It was done in order to preserve sea life and also sustain the livelihood of fishermen," said George.
 
 "The boats that were ceased were actively partaking in juvenile fishing and violating the law. We are not willing to compromise our position against juvenile fishing," said Mahesh S, deputy director of fisheries.
