MUMBAI: A couple has been sentenced to five years in   for duping several US and Singapore hotel job aspirants of crores of rupees in 2010.

 Yash Upalkar and his wife, Jagruti, were also fined Rs 50,000 each by the 47th metropolitan magistrate, A P Kulkarni, failure to pay which would add six months to their sentence.
 
 Public prosecutor Trimbakwala T A said the duo had been convicted under relevant sections of the IPC for cheating, forgery, breach of trust and criminal intimidation and under the Immigration Act. 
 
 In 2010, Upalkar launched Vision International and IT Solutions in Kurla and claimed to be recruiting for job openings in the packaging department of various hotels across the US. 
 
 Aspirants were told that they would get a salary of Rs 2.5 lakh per month and that the initial expense to send them abroad would be Rs 10 lakh. 
 
 The police said that whenever an aspirant did not have the money, the Upalkars would ask them to give whatever they could and tell them the rest would be deducted from their salary.
 
 Officials of the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) said the accused also forged documents and issued work permits with company names like Branch Sea Food Company of London, Golden State Food of America.
 
 The Upalkars gave candidates an assurance on stamp paper that their entire money would be refunded if they did not get a job abroad, said the police.
 
 Trimbakwala argued in court that the accused had cheated poor people and should be given the maximum punishment under the law. 
 
 EOW officials said they collected a large number of documents and presented several witnesses while guarding against their turning hostile, leading to the conviction.
