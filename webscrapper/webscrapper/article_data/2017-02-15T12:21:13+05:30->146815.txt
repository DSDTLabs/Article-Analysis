NAGPUR: With an aim to encourage science among school kids who usually don’t get to perform scientific experiments in their school laboratories,   (RSC) have set up a state-of-the-art innovation centre — a scientific laboratory where students can become members and perform science experiments under the centre’s mentorship, utilizing their weekends. The centre was inaugurated on Tuesday by   (NU) vice-chancellor Dr VC Kane.

 During the inauguration, Nehru Science Centre (Mumbai) director   and RSC city head Ramdas Iyer were also present.
 
 Khened said, “The government has a scheme in which two senior scientists will soon be engaged here as mentor and chief mentor. We are also open to send the children to places like Neeri or other research lab depending on their interest.”
 
 Encouraging students to develop scientific temperament, he said, “There are various set-ups where you can perform experiments, formulate your own hypotheses, falsify them, revalidate them, and bring in more statistical models, which will ultimately benefit society.”
 
 Dr Kane said, “By just telling scientific concepts to students, they will eventually forget it. By showing them those concepts, they might remember it. But, by involving them, they will never forget. That is exactly where this innovation centre comes into the picture. Right from Day One, students will get to perform experiments on their own under mentorship.”
 
  Iyer said, “The  , which is the parent organization of RSC, has taken this initiative to meet the requirement of budding scientists on a small scale.”
 
 The centre has been aesthetically designed and will be a unique facility of its kind in the country because of its unique design, said Iyer.
 
 He added that the hub has sections on break and make (Tod-Phod-Jod), start-up activities (making things with one’s own hands), other start-up experimental activities, making things from scrap, real-life problem identification and experiments, and interdisciplinary mini-research projects on subjects like physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, robotics and environmental science.
 
 He said, “In addition, there will be what is called an idea box where all visitors to the centre will be asked to write down problems and innovative solutions and drop them into the box with their contact details. Periodically, they will be evaluated for viability by a committee of scientists. The good ones will be taken up for experimentation and validation and the original proposer of the idea will be co-opted to work on the project.”
 
 HOW IT WILL WORK
 
 * School students between Std VI and XII can become individual members
 
 * For individual members, the center will be open on Saturday and Sunday
 
 * Mentors will help students perform experiments related to physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, robotics and environmental science
 
 * After becoming members, students will submit their project idea
 
 * They can start working on the project if it is approved by the expert committee
 
 * Students will need to document their daily work at the completion of each project session
 
 * School can also send student groups of maximum 40 students on prior booking basis
 
 * To become member, one can contact 0712-2770187
