AHMEDABAD: The standing committee of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has decided to take up a major drive to clean up the 20-km-long, polluted  , which passes through eastern parts of the city.

 Chairman of the standing committee,  , said the canal cleaning work will be taken up with help from local people, councillors, MLAs of the area concerned and others. Patel that during a recent visit to the area, chief minister   asked the   to take up a cleaning operation with help from the state government if required. The AMC has decided to take the CM’s advice.
 
 Patel said the clean-up drive will begin in May and will finish before the monsoon. AMC officials said that the canal, which if filled with industrial waste, will be challenging to clean, as officials will first have to stop the flow of illegal industrial waste into the canal. Officials said the AMC had in 2010 announced beautifications projects for the canal, but to no effect.
 
 In 2010, it was announced that the Kharicut Canal, which passes through Naroda, would be transformed into a joggers’ track, a green space for children and senior citizens and with a green driveway along the canal’s length. Irrigation department mooted a project worth Rs 390 crore to cover up the from Naroda to Vatva Kotha with RCC slabs and develop a 15-metre wide garden on top of the slabs. The sides were to get five-metre-wide roads. All this has remained on paper and only 3km of the canal has been covered with RCC slabs.
