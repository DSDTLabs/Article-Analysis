CHANDIGARH:   Corporation ( ), which is struggling to rein-in its falling revenue, is bearing losses worth several lakhs per month as its prime properties are either non-operational or lying vacant.

 Baithak, a Punjabi-styled restaurant at Kalagram, is non-operational since November 2015 after the experiment of outsourcing it failed. The restaurant was outsourced for Rs 6.25 lakh per month. Before it was outsourced, Baithak had an average monthly sale figure of around Rs 1 lakh and the decision was marred by controversy as the firm that had bagged the contract failed to deposit the security amount of Rs 36.30 lakh in time forcing the corporation to debar it. 
 
 While the corporation is planning to open an amusement park at the restaurant and floated tenders for the same four times, it has failed to attract any firm for the purpose. At present, the restaurant wears deserted look as it is closed for general public. The entire premises is in shambles as it has not been maintained.
 
 Similarly, Drop In, a multi-cuisine restaurant at Sector 34, is also non functional since October last year. The restaurant was being run by a private firm that was paying Rs 1.25 lakh per month as rent.
 
 Meanwhile, all five shops in Hotel Shivalik View and one in  , first five-star hotel of the city, are also lying vacant. The rent of the shops varies between Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 per month. With the shops lying vacant, Citco is failing to realise rent income of around Rs 20 lakh per annum.
 
 From the last few years, Citco has been witnessing a fall in its revenue. There are around 900 employees working in different units (industrial and tourism) of Citco, while a workforce of around 500 employees has been hired on contract through service providers. The corporation has to generate its own revenue to meet its expenditures.
