BHOPAL: Just three months after grudgingly slashing VAT on petrol and diesel, the Madhya Pradesh cabinet on Wednesday ratified an ordinance to make petrol and diesel costlier in the state. 

 Government spokesman   said that the council of ministers has approved the Madhya Pradesh Motor Speed Bill 2018, which will enable the government to levy a cess of 50 paise per litre on petrol and diesel. "The hike in rates will not happen immediately and will take some time. The ordinance will first be sent to the commercial tax department," Mishra said. The government expects to raise Rs 200 crore from this cess, which will be utilised for infrastructure development, Mishra told reporters.
 
  was quick to criticise the new levy. Leader of Opposition   said, "The state already has the highest tax on fuel in the country. And now the   government has given this New Year gift - an ordinance to hike prices on petrol and diesel. The BJP government is levying yet another cess to raise Rs 200 crore for infrastructure development. This money for construction of roads could have easily come if the government reduced expenditure on branding of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The branding and image building of Chouhan costs no less than Rs 500 cr annually."
 
  MP charges among the highest rates for fuel due to high VAT rates - 28% on petrol and 22% on diesel at present. On October 13, after PM   asked governments to reduce tax components on fuel, the MP government reduced VAT on petrol by 3% and diesel by 5%. It also withdrew an additional cess of Rs 1.50 per litre on diesel. The cuts were expected to cost the it Rs 2,000 crore in revenue, and the cash-strapped government could not sustain the largesse for long. The 50-paise cess will dampen the blow to the exchequer after the tax cuts in October.
