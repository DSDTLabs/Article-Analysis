NAVI MUMBAI: A recent amendment to the formation of   has given a glimmer of hope to owners of   registered under  . 

 The new directive, issued in a circular on March 3 by Chandrakant Dalvi, commissioner of Cooperation and Registrar Co-operative Societies, states that only 51% consent is needed, against the earlier 60%, to form a cooperative housing society.
 
 Around 200 such associations will get many benefits if they are registered as cooperative housing societies. A civic official said that buildings constructed by Cidco before 1990 have been registered under Apartment Owners Association Act. A legal consultant for the Vashi condominiums said that these associations have no legal standing and as a result, majority are ill-maintained. “Unlike Apartments Act, the laws of cooperative housing societies like paying for the society’s maintenance are binding on members. If they don’t follow the rules, they can face penal action,” he added.
 
 The directive is also being viewed by many as a way for these condominiums’ redevelopment plans. “The directive is a ray of hope, as 100% consent is now mandatory to go for redevelopment,” said corporator Kishor Patkar, fighting for redevelopment of condominiums.
 
 But the civic administration ruled out possibility of any leeway. “Any apartment owner's association getting registered under Cooperative Housing Societies Act will not alter the original contract between them and Cidco,” said an additional municipal commissioner. This means that the 100% percent consent condition will prevail.
 
 But people are hopeful that they will at least have a legal standing to fight in court for their redevelopment proposal. As a source explained, any Apartment Owners Association registered as a co-operative society, can legally forward a redevelopment proposal under the Act. A co-operative housing society needs 70% consent to go for redevelopment.
