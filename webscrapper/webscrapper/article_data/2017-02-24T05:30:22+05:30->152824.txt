 Criticising ABVP, she declared, “Umar Khalid’s case is sub-judice and he has been granted bail. Who gave ABVP the right to certify somebody as a nationalist or an anti-national?

The censorship being carried out by rightist political factions needs to end, and all progressive forces must say no to this kind of hooliganism.”
