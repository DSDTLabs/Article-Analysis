Hyderabad: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) will be coming out the new broker regulations soon, IRDAI chief TS   said here on Wednesday. 

 “We have sent the new broker regulations for the Gazette notification. The redrafted regulation will help in governing brokers and maximize value for policy holders,” Vijayan told brokers at the 14th Insurance Brokers Summit. 
 
 Pointing out that brokers accounted for 27% of new insurance last year, he urged them to make the claim settlement process more transparent by adopting technology. A total Rs 1,27,000 crore general insurance premium and Rs 4,00,000 crore life insurance premium was collected last year, even as health insurance sector has been growing at 43% per annum. Pointing out that though life insurance penetration has not even touched 4% and that of general insurance is much lower, he nevertheless expressed satisfaction at the way the sector has been growing. “The sector is growing very well, both life, non-life and even health. Future growth will come from all the industries like automotive etc. The overall growth in the economy will also propel the insurance industry.”
 
 He also attributed the sector’s growth to a slew of measures taken by the government, including Demonetisation, GST and introduction of various government insurance schemes, he said schemes like Fasal Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana for generating a “positive attitude in the people towards insurance”. “These two steps (GST and Demon) have led to formalization of the economy as insurance is also a formal part of the economy. Lot more people are coming into the formal sector for doing business from the informal sector. When formalization happens it helps an industry like insurance,” said the outgoing IRDAI chief who is set to retire next month.
