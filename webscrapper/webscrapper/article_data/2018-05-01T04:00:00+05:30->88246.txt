Surat: Airport director Dilip Sajnani was transferred on Monday triggering speculation on the social media that he was shunted in wake of the slow progress at the airport.

 Sajnani will be replaced by S K Panigrahi from Imphal airport, who will be taking charge soon. Sajnani has been transferred barely a year after he was appointed at Surat airport.
 
 Speaking to the TOI, Sajnani said, “I pray that Surat’s dream to fly internationally be fulfilled soon and the city remains safe and secure always. The love and affection Surtis have showed has been praiseworthy.” 
 
 Co-chairman of SGCCI’s aviation committee Manoj Singapuri said, “Sajnani has been forthright in calling a spade a spade. Obstruction surveys for buildings are to be done every two years, but in Surat it was done after 10 years and that too with Sajnani’s persistence. He brought all the shortcomings of Surat airport in public domain and this may have irked the people who opposed progress at Surat airport.”
 
 Surat MP Darshana Jardosh said, “We are delighted that the incoming director has an experience of handling an international airport. It’s a very positive sign for much needed international connectivity that we have been working onerously for.”
 
 RTI activist Rajesh Modi said, “Imphal airport is the third busiest in northern-east India. Since the incoming director has already been handling an international airport, he brings a ray of hope to Surtis who are looking forward to overseas connectivity.”
