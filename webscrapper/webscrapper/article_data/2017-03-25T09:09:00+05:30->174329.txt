NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old man hanged himself using a rope from the grilles of Keshav Puram   on Friday morning. Police said that the man has been identified as a resident of Ashok Vihar who had been missing from his house since Thursday night.

 Police said that on Friday morning, around 7am, Anil Gupta’s body was found hanging behind the Metro station. He allegedly committed suicide at a place which was at walking distance from his house because he was facing a financial crisis.
 
 Gupta, a property dealer in Ashok Vihar, owed a huge amount of money to several people and was also undergoing trial for a case of cheating for which he served jail time of three months. “He was sent to judicial custody on charges of cheating and was released two months ago,” said the officer.
 
 Gupta’s body was found hanging from the noose using the low-height fence of the boundary wall of the station after which it was sent for postmortem at Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital.
 
 Police said that Gupta had sent WhatsApp messages to all his loved ones around 8pm on Thursday night, bidding them goodbye. “However, they didn’t take him seriously because he was a habitual drinker and used to act in that manner regularly,” the official said.
