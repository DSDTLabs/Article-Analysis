Vadodara: Chhayapuri railway station will start functioning as a satellite railway station by end of this year.  On Saturday, Vadodara MP Ranjan Bhatt laid foundation stone for developing the railway station as a satellite station for which the Indian Railways will be spending Rs 40 crore.  “The project will help reduce congestion at Vadodara railway station which witnesses movement of more than 200 passenger trains passing through the station in 24 hours,” said Amit Kumar Singh, divisional railway manager of Vadodara railway division.  “Presently, all the train which are moving between Ahmedabad to Godhra side come to Vadodara railway station and their direction is reversed before they move towards Godhra or towards Ahmedabad. By developing Chhayapuri as a satellite railway station, all this train will directly go to Ahmedabad or Godhra from Chhayapuri without occupying the Vadodara railway station thereby helping in decongestion of the Vadodara railway station,” he said, adding that this will also help reduce travelling time of each train by around 40 minutes.  Chhayapuri is also being developed as a satellite railway station in view of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project being executed by the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited.  “Because of the high speed rail corridor, platform number seven of the Vadodara railway station will get affected and we will have one less platform for regular train movement,” said Singh.  The satellite railway station will have all the passenger amenities including station building, booking windows, catering facilities, station master office and parcel office.
