  When 18-year-old Pragati Goswami’s Class XII CBSE Board exams were going on, her father, Amarnath  , was suddenly taken ill. As he was diabetic and suffering from high blood pressure, she and her sister would take him to the doctor for checkups after coming home from the exam centre. Later, he suffered a brain hemorrhage and hospitalized. But he passed away. Five days after Pragati’s father passed away, she wrote her physical education exam. Despite the trauma, the girl secured 76% marks in Science stream.
 
  Recounting her ordeal, Pragati said, “My exams started from March 13 and it was extremely difficult to concentrate on studies as my father, a priest in a local temple, was suddenly taken ill. He complained of high blood pressure and sugar level. When my exams were going on, my elder sister and I would take him to a doctor. I was so concerned about his health that I could not focus on my studies. I used to think that in such a scenario if I managed to pass the exams, it would be enough for me,’’ said Pragati, a student of   and a resident of   here.
  
  Pragati said, “My father was admitted to a local hospital on March 28 and he was diagnosed with brain haemorrhage. He died on April 4 and I had to appear for my last exam of physical education on April 9. It was so sudden — we never expected that he would leave us. It was painful for me to write my physical education exam,’’ said Pragati, whose mother is a homemaker while her elder sister took her BCom final-year exam recently. She added, “I am satisfied with my score considering the conditions at home.’’
  
  Pragati aspires to become a doctor and had appeared for National Eligibility Cum Entrance Exam. “I am currently awaiting my NEET results and will decide on college depending on the rank,’’ said she.
