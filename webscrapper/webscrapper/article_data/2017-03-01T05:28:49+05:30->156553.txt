Mumbai: Four months after being arrested in the SpeakAsia case, a special court recently granted bail to the 56-year-old widow of Manoj Sharma, India CEO of the firm. Renu Sharma, a schoolteacher, was ordered to be released on bail after furnishing a bond of Rs one lakh. 

 The court said that irrespective of the economic offences wing’s (EOW) “suspicion of Manoj’s death”, the affidavit filed by his children saying that their father died in their presence and Renu’s statement cannot be disbelieved. Renu was arrested on October 5 last year and a previous bail plea was rejected by the court. The EOW had alleged that Renu was a signing authority and along with her husband and another accused, Rajeev Mehrotra, were directors of companies Tulsiyat Tek Pvt Ltd, Tulsient Information Systems Pvt Ltd and Seven Rings Education Pvt Ltd which were involved in the crime. The EOW alleged that since 2003 the group along with another accused, Ramnivas Pal, and others were involved in floating different fraudulent schemes in Mumbai. The agency said that the directors would receive money from investors, keep it in Tulsiyat’s bank account and later transfer it to SpeakAsia’s Singapore account. The EOW claimed Renu was the authorized signatory and Rs 710 crore was laundered from India to Singapore from a company in which she was a director.
 
 The defence said that Renu had no connection with the crime and until 2011 was working as a full-time teacher. 
 
 While granting bail, the court said, the investigating agency was unable to point out a single document signed by Renu from 2012 until her arrest to show that she was involved in her husband’s business affairs independently. 
 
 “The applicant being a is supposed remain present at school. Under such circumstances it is doubted that the applicant has taken personal interest in the business affairs,” the court said.
