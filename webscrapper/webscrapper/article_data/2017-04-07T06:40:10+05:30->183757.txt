NEW DELHI: The capital's parks seem to be turning into dens of criminals after sunset. Be it the double murder at   four days ago, or the rape of a woman at   in February, or the   rape case of 2003, little seems to have changed in terms of security.

 Park guards usually leave by 6pm. Police say that routine patrolling is conducted, but sources reveal that men in khaki seldom go inside parks, especially after being accused of misconduct several times.
 
 Nevertheless, senior officers have suggested regular night patrolling to keep out the rogue elements. Having police posts or pickets around the parks at night may also help.
 
 On Thursday, when TOIvisited the Picnic Hut park and spoke to the gardeners, they said they couldn't stop anyone from entering without being beaten up. There are four gates to the park, all of which are partially closed. A structure in the middle of the park is a hub for drug addicts and vagabonds through the day.
 
 But even policemen can't always stop anti-social elements in parks. A few months ago, a police officer was thrashed for trying to stop a group of youths from harassing a girl.
