MUMBAI: After a delay of seven years, the   has shortlisted seven contractors for the construction of two   to cater to the upcoming highrises in central Mumbai and areas near Deonar. First proposed in 2011, the project cost was pegged at Rs 470 crore; now, the cost has escalated to over Rs 1,000 crore.

 Civic officials said presently there is no water shortage in the Wadala-Parel belt, but there are several highrises coming up in the area, which could increase demand. 
 
 “As the water needs in these areas will increase drastically, we decided to expedite the water tunnel project,” said a civic officer.
 
 The BMC invited two separate tenders for the project with open technology and received seven bids. “We have given the bidders’ suggested technical details to IIT-B experts for their opinion and accordingly will soon select the lowest bidder for the work,” said additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Mukherjee. Civic officials said the process will take around two weeks, after which they will put the selected bidder’s proposal before the standing committee for final approval.
 
 While the 9.7km   to be built at a cost of Rs 602 crore will replace the existing water pipeline along the stretch, the 5.5 km   to be constructed at a cost of Rs 408 crore is expected to resolve the water woes in the area. 
 
 Civic officials said after the work is commissioned, they expect the tunnels to be ready in five years. 
 
 The BMC is constructing concretized water tunnels to augment supply and replace the old, corroded water pipelines that are suspectible to bursts and leakages.
