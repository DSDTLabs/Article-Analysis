PANCHKULA: A man duped a senior citizen of Rs 1.10 lakh in probably one of the first cases of a fraudster using the ruse of checking whether   card number has been linked with a bank account in the Tricity.

 Baljeet  , 69, a retired government employee, told police he received a call from an unknown person claiming himself to be an official of UIDAI, the agency responsible for issuing Aadhaar cards. “He asked me to give details of necessary documents to verify his Aadhaar has got linked with his bank or not,” said Singh, a resident of Rail Vihar,  , Sector 4.
 
 The accused asked Singh about his PAN and Aadhaar card and bank account number. When Singh gave the information, the accused asked for the OTP (one time password), which Singh told him. “The accused asked about the OTP from me over three times. I did not know he will take out the money from my bank account fraudulently,” said Singh.
 
 Sub-inspector  , the investigating officer, said, “The accused called from two different numbers. We have started our investigation and he will be arrested soon.”
 
 Police registered a case under Section 420 of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) at the Mansa Devi Complex police station.
