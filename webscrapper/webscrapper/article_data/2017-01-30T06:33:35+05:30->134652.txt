AHMEDABAD:  , minister of Union human resource and development (HRD), said on Sunday that the pre-poll alliance between Samajwadi Party (SP) and   in   was all about ‘pariwar, propaganda and power’. He claimed the coalition will not be able to take on   in the largest state of the country.

 “In UP, a new political drama has started today. In a joint press conference, Congress and SP leaders gave a slogan of ‘3 Ps’ that is progress, prosperity and peace. But, the real slogan should be 'pariwar (family), propaganda and power'. That is the real reason why they have come together,” Javadekar, who was in the city to attend 'Digi-Dhan Mela' in Vejalpur area, told reporters. The mela was arranged by district administration to spread awareness about digital financial transactions.
 
 “Two rejected parties cannot become a decisive force by forming an alliance. People know how UP was looted and what is the state of law and order today. A new slogan cannot change this situation. It is very clear that people are with BJP and you will see it when poll results are out in March,” Javadekar claimed.
 
 “SP has been in power for five years in UP. The party was also with Congress for 10 years at the Centre. What stopped them from bringing peace, prosperity and progress at that time? You cannot hide your sins now by changing your outer appearance,” said Javadekar.
 
 Earlier on Sunday, in Lucknow, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had addressed a joint press conference and gave a call for crushing BJP’s divisive politics to ensure progress, prosperity, peace and people of Uttar Pradesh in the assembly elections.
 
 Reacting to this, Javadekar said the SP-Congress coalition did not stand a chance to win the polls, as people were well aware of their track record.
