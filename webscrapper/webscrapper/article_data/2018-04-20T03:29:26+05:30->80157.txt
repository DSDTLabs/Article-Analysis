MUMBAI: A   was arrested for allegedly   from commuters after hitting them on their arm or wrist. It is the fourth time in two years that the   (GRP) have arrested the 17-year-old. The boy, who had been lodged at the   on Sunday, escaped from the premises a day later. 

 The teenager lives with his family in   (west). 
 
 A GRP officer said that the boy would stand on the platform near the entrance of a compartment and scout for a target. "Just as the train would pull out of the platform, he would hit a commuter closest to the door, on the arm or the wrist, forcing the commuter to drop his mobile phone," said the police officer.
 
 The accused does not have any associates and operates alone, said the railway police. 
 
 On April 12, the teenager stood towards the southern end of platform 3 at Bandra station. Around 3.15 pm, he struck a 22-year-old commuter, Siddhant Jadhav, who was travelling from Vile Parle to Dadar. 
 
 Jadhav's mobile phone slipped out of his hand and the teenager quickly scooped it up and escaped. 
 
 The next day, Jadhav lodged a complaint at the GRP's Bandra outpost. The police checked footage of cameras at the station and made inquiries with their informants. On Sunday, the teen was detained and sent to the observation home as he is a minor. Jadhav's cellphone worth Rs 11,000 was recovered from him. 
 
 However, around 12.45 pm on Monday, the boy vaulted over the periphery wall of the home and escaped. The railway police are looking for him. In 2017, he had been booked in three cases of theft, the police said.
