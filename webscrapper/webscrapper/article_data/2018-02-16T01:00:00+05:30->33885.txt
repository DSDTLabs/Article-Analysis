And the kind of love the film has received, I am overwhelmed. It is a great honour and joy to be here today with a picture that remains faithful to all my convictions and the images I have loved since infancy.”

We’re trying to do something that’s a little more difficult and thoughtful. All the adulation that we have received in the form of awards is very reassuring; we now know for a fact that we have done something right.”
