SURAT: The central government has sent   minister of state for road transport and highways   as its emissary to the Diamond City to talk to the textile traders, who are on an indefinite strike for the last four days against Goods and   (GST) on fabrics. 

 Mandaviya, who arrived in the city on Thursday, will be meeting leaders of Textile GST Sangharsh Samiti ( ) and representatives of powerloom weaving and textile processing sectors on Friday, sources said. 
 
 Navsari MP C R Paatil had made a failed attempt to divide the traders’ community by organizing a meeting at Veer Narmad South Gujarat University’s (VNSGU) convention hall on July 2. A handful of 100 textile traders attended the meeting and agreed to open their shops from July 3. 
 
 Paatil and his supporters on July 3 went to the textile markets on Ring Road along with policemen to allow these traders to open their shops, which resulted in lathicharge and injuries to at least 12 traders. The central leadership was unhappy with the way Paatil dealt with the traders’ issue. The lathicharge resulted in the indefinite strike. 
 
 Sensing trouble after the traders threatened to resign from the primary membership of the BJP, the Central Government took a decision to depute Mandaviya as its emissary to listen to the problems and demands of the textile sector. 
 
 TGSS convener Tarachand Kasat said, “We will meet Mandaviya at Agrasen Bhavan at City Light on Friday afternoon. We will demand abolition of GST on MMF fabrics and instead increasing the GST at the yarn stage. The textile traders do not want to come under GST regime arguing that 80 per cent of them operate from less than 200 square feet shops.”
 
 Leader of powerloom weaving industry Ashish Gujarati said, “Our meeting with Mandaviya is scheduled in the evening. Our demands include nill rate of GST on powerloom job-work, refund of accumulated tax credit and imposing additional import duty or cess on imported Chinese fabrics.”
