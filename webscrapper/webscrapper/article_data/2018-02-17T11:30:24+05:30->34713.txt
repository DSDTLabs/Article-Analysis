RAJKOT: Chief minister Vijay Rupani, who will be on a two-day visit to his hometown Rajkot from Saturday, will be inaugurating number of projects, including an ‘incomplete’ stretch of 40-feet Ring Road 2.

 The opposition   has alleged that the Ring Road 2 was supposed to be 150-foot-wide four-lane road, but the road that CM is scheduled to inaugurate was just 40-foot-wide two-lane road like a village approach road. 
 
 Rajkot city Congress president Mahesh   said CM will be inaugurating 11 km stretch from   to Pardi, but work on 4 km stretch from   to Pardi was still incomplete.
 
 “BJP does not have vision. The new ring road is so narrow that looks like a small village road and that too is incomplete,” Rajput said. 
 
 Rupai will also lay foundation stone of nearly 21 projects of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), city police,   and Rajkot Urban Development Authority on Saturday. He will also flag off the Rajkot marathon on Sunday morning. 
 
 According to city officials, CM will inaugurate projects worth Rs 175 crore, which includes eight projects of Saurashtra University, RMC’s cycle track near   and some town planning schemes.
