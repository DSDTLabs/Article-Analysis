Mohali: Councillors here have demanded that before banning children from playing in parks and green belts, the municipal corporation must provide alternatives first.

 At a recently held house meet, some councillors demanded that a ban should be imposed on playing in parks and green belts. “Playing in the parks that are adjacent to houses damages their windows,” the councilors had said.
 
 Keeping this in view, councillors Sukhdev Singh Patwari, Hamanpreet Singh, Sahibe Anand, Kuljit Singh Bedi said that before banning the children from playing in the parks and green belts, the corporation must provide alternatives.
 
 “We will soon find a solution to this problem. The children must get a place to play. Playing in streets is dangerous. The matter has been highlighted and will be resolved soon,” said MC commissioner Sandeep Hans.
 
 Besides this, the corporation has given its approval to set up a children-friendly park near JCT mill in industrial area Phase VIII. This children-friendly park will come up at a cost of Rs 40.98 lakh under Atal Mission for Rejuvenating and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) plan. “A detailed project report for this has been received. The house too has given its approval,” Hans said. 
 
 Meanwhile, the councillors also raised the issue of poor condition of the city parks. The councillors seemed unhappy with the work of the private companies.
 
 Parking of vehicles in parks and green belts is another issue which has not been addressed for a long time.
 
  The parks maintenance company has been under pressure for not getting such parks cleared of encroachment.
