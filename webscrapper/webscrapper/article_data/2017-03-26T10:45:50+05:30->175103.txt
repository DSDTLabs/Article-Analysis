The Kardashian family has beefed up security after   West was robbed at gun point back in October and her half-sister   had USD 2,00,000 worth of jewelry snatched from her home last week.
 
  
 
  
    personality   revealed that her family has increased security to a "crazy level", reported Us weekly.
  
  "It's an eye-opener how many people have tried to access our homes... We're protected to a crazy level," Kris said.
  
  A source close to the family also said, "Security and privacy issues have changed not only for her but for the whole family. They have security guards most of the time when they go out.
