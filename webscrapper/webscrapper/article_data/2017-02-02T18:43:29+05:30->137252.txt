 "I've had a hard time but it's behind me. I'm just planning my season for the classics, it's been going great so far. The team is super strong and super motivated. It's a great feeling to deliver this victory for my new team."
 
 Meanwhile, Ukrainian rider Andriy Hrivko of Astana team was disqualified from the Tour after punching Kittel in the face during Thursday's third stage, organisers said.
 
 Kittel sustained a cut to his eyebrow, which resulted in a bloodied face. "I got punched by Andriy Grivko from Astana. That's why I had blood on my face but I didn't crash," Kittel said in a statement by organisers. "There was some confusion in the race. My team worked well for the sprint but I was not in a perfect position and maybe my head was elsewhere too."
 
 Astana was quick to serve an apology to Kittel and his team on Twitter. The tweet read as follows
