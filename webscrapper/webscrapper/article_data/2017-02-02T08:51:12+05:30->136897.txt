NEW DELHI: Just days before 10 of its shops were damaged in Wednesday’s fire, the Rustagi family was actually planning to buy another shop in  .

 “We had recently spent crores buying new sarees and lehengas. But all of it is now burnt,” said Manish Rustagi, who is also the market president. Shopkeepers said that all the shops were shut down by 9pm on Tuesday, just like every other day. “I received a call and reached my shop within 20 minutes. At that time, the fire had not spread so widely. Later when the power was not cut for over an hour, the fire spread and caused this much damage,” Rustagi said. 
 
 Three shops of artificial jewellery and two other jewellery shops were also destroyed in the incident. “After the minor fire on Sunday, we had not expected that something this big would happen. I am the only earning member of my family and have no clue what we will do now,” said Ganeshi Lal, who owns a jewellery shop. 
 
 “Our shop has been here for 60 years and the   run in crores. We will be able to ascertain the exact amount only when we make a list of the burnt items,” said Harshit Rustagi, owner of a saree shop. 
 
 Along with those weeping over their losses, was a man who had a close shave. “My saree shop was thankfully spared by the fire. 10 of our workers had stayed back at night as they had an early morning shift. When I received a call from them I feared the worst but thankfully none of them were hurt,” said Mahesh Jain.
