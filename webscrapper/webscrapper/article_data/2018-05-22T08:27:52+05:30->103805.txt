BENGALURU: Angry over the steep hike in the price of books to be procured for their kids, parents of students studying in   in   staged a protest against the school management on Monday. The protest turned ugly when parents accused the school principal of being opaque, and forcing them to buy books from the school.

 Parents accused the school of running a business by selling books through the school. “Prices have shot up by three or four times. We can buy the same books from the open market at cheaper rates. But when we questioned the principal, he stopped answering our calls. And when we came here, his bouncers manhandled us,” said the mother of a student.
 
 Parents said classes for Grade 10 started on Monday, but without books. “We had to pay a demand draft for Rs 8,000 to the teachers for textbooks, while collecting the report cards of our wards in March. We were told that we could even get the books delivered at home. I chose that option. But now they want me to come between May 28 and 31and collect the books. On Monday, the principal kept denying that teachers have collected demand drafts. The list of books was displayed on Monday, and many parents said the publishers of some books are known to publish texts for   and not ICSE stream,” she told TOI.
 
 Heated arguments went on between the principal,  , and the parents for a couple of hours, and when there was no resolution, one parent went to the extent of lying down on the floor to force the principal to answer their queries.
 
 The parents said   later locked himself in his room. He reportedly blamed the management and sought two days’ time to get the remaining textbooks for parents who have already paid the sum to the school.
