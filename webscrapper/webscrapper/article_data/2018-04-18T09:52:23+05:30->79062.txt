MYSURU; Chief minister  , who has never had qualms in claiming to be an agnostic, on Monday performed an arati to   at a temple in   as the priest had left for the day. The CM was campaigning in the assembly constituency.

 The temple doors remained locked but the CM chose to perform the puja from outside.
 
 A local leader from   said that even though Siddaramaiah had declared that he isn’t an atheist, they had never never seen him performing arati at any temple. “He believes in social justice and equality preached by social reformer Basavanna and follows RM Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan. He has said he visits temples but never performs puja even at home,” he said.
 
 Siddaramaiah is likely to be seen visiting more temples in the coming days.
