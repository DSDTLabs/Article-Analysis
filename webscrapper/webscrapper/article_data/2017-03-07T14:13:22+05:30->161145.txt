AMRITSAR: The ‘jathedars’ appointed by the Sarbat Khalsa have appealed to Sikh bodies in the US to work unitedly to counter hate crimes against the community members. The appeal came after a recent attack on 39-year-old Sikh man  , who was attacked by a partially masked gunman outside his home in Kent town of   on March 3.

 “Not only Sikhs, but in the recent past Hindu-Americans were also subjected to hate attacks. So we have appealed to the Sikh bodies to work jointly with Hindu and other such bodies against racial attacks,” said ‘jathedar’ of Takht Damdama Sahib Baljit Singh   while talking to TOI on Monday.
 
 Holding the SGPC responsible of its alleged failure to work for promoting Sikh identity outside India through its foreign affairs unit, Daduwal said, “If the SGPC had judiciously performed its duty, Sikhs would not have faced hate attacks.” He said there was a dire need for a concerted campaign to make Americans aware of Sikhs and their identity.
 
 Meanwhile, the American Sikh Council (ASC), an umbrella organization representating US Sikhs and having 71 gurdwaras and other institutions as its members, has alerted all gurdwaras to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the law enforcement authorities. The ASC has also urged Sikh-Americans to be more engaged with all communities, inter-faith, school and civic groups in order to educate and pro-actively minimize any future attacks against community members.
