RANCHI: All roads in   led to the   on Wednesday evening as revellers poured in from all corners of the city to celebrate  . 

 The usually busy streets wore a deserted look in the morning. Government offices, schools and colleges were closed for the day. The district police had made elaborate security arrangements, which included installing   cameras at important locations, to keep the city incident-free. Drone cameras, quick response teams and additional deployment of police personnel were the other measures taken up to manage any untoward situation. 
 
 But by the time the sun set, the streets were a riot of colours and the city erupted in celebration. Revellers took to the streets with swords and flags bearing giant images of Hanuman and Ram. Amid loud music in praise of the two gods, devotees set in the mood for the evening. 
 
 Thousands gathered on the main road to watch the annual event as processions wound their way. People from various ‘akharas’ demonstrated their swordsmanship much to the delight of the crowd. Processions moved from the historic Albert Ekka Chowk to Tapovan, a few km away. 
 
    and state minister for urban development, CP Singh, and Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay attended the processions and extended their good wishes to the people.
