GAYA: Delay in the receipt of forensic lab (FSL) report in the rape-cum-murder case in which an eight-year-old girl was kidnapped, raped and strangled, has held back chargesheet in the case. Zonal IG   had directed the district police to ensure submission of chargesheet within a week. The deadline however, expired on 15 February.

 Gaya had erupted in anger against deteriorating law and order situation following the recovery of the body of the minor girl who was abducted from the Gewalbigha locality of the town on February 7. The body of the girl, apparently raped, was found abandoned in a bush near the Magadh University VC’s official residence. The area, also being the back side of the DM’s residence spread over 15 acre of land, is otherwise regarded as the most protected part of the town falling under the Rampur police station area.
 
 SSP Garima Malik said that she was waiting for the FSL report. Chargesheet would be submitted once the FSL report is available. Forensic science experts collected samples on February 8 itself from the place of occurrence. Chhotu Ravani, the lone accused of the case is currently lodged in Gaya jail. Earlier, Magadh division commissioner   said the accused would be put on speedy trial.
 
 Meanwhile, in a letter addressed to chief minister  , noted activist   while demanding a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the victim's family, alleged the girl's father was shabbily treated and the family has not received any relief.
 
 Asked about Patkar's allegation that relief has not been provided to the family, DM Abhishekh Singh said, “A sum of Rs 20,000 has already been given to the family and a proposal to sanction Rs 3 lakh has been sent to the competent authority for approval. GMC, employer of the victim's father has also given a financial help of Rs 50,000.”
