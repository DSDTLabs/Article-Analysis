INDORE: Madhya Pradesh Ranji team captain   on Saturday announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the Holkar stadium.

 
 In 2016, the 41-year-old had broken the record of most number of appearances in  , surpassing that of Amol Muzumdar playing his 137th encounter.
 
 Presently he still holds the record with 145 Ranji matches.
 
 However, despite scoring runs for his team consistently and proving his mettle year after year, the cricketing veteran from Ujjain couldn’t find a spot in the Indian Test team in his 25-year-long cricketing career.
 
 “I feel it is the right time to retire when people say that you can play more. I feel honoured that I pursued a career in what I loved the most - cricket. To call it day, it is very hard and emotional for me but then there is a time for all the players who go through the complete circle of life,” said Bundela addressing a press conference at the Holkar stadium.
 
 
  
 
 Cherishing memories of time spent at the stadium with his teammates, Bundela said, “Memories I have since I fell in love with this game are countless and I have cherished each and every one on and off the field.”
 
 Despite not being able to make it big in the Indian team in a lustrous career, Bundela doesn’t hold any grudges against the selectors. “My job was to play cricket and I played with my whole heart, their job was to select a team they did their job. If a player only plays to get selected for the Indian team then it will be very difficult for him to survive in the game,” he said.
 
 Bundela played for India under-19 squad against Australia however none from the same team could make it to the Test team.
 
 He is the third highest scorer in Ranji with 9201 runs including 24 centuries.
 
 He also expressed his will to render his services for the game as a coach for MPCA. “If the MPCA officials would want me to coach the players here I would love to that also,” said Bundela.
