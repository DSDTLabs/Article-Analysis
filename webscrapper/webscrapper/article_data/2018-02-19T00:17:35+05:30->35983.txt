Pune: Increasing awareness about mental illnesses in the community, team efforts in treating patients and how the Mental   Act 2017 may pose challenges were among the topics that came up during the interviews of prominent   at Balgandharva Rangamandir on Sunday.

 Noted psychiatrist Anand Nandkarni posed the issues to senior psychiatrists Ulhas Luktuke, Vidyadhar Watve and Mohan Agashe.
 
 Institute of Psychological Health (IPH), Thane, in association with Sigmund Freud Mental Health Research and Psycho Analysis Institute, Pune (run by Payas Bahuuddeshiya Vikas Sanstha, Amravati) had organised the event. 
 
 "Awareness and acceptance about mental illness has improved over the years. Now even faith healers refer patients to us after they exhaust their resources," Watve said.
 
 “We have a range of anti-psychotics and anti-depressants. We have reached the stage where we are talking about pharmacogenomics __rendering personalised treatment to patients," Watve added. 
 
 He was the national president of Indian Psychiatry Association.
 
 Agashe spoke about the current era of digital technology. "We have more advanced gadgets of communication on one hand and on the other, we have people who are suffering from loneliness and social alienation," he said. He also stressed on quality in mental healthcare.
 
 The country initiated National Mental Health Programme in 1987. 
 
 Since then, there have been positive changes, he said. Agashe is the founding director of Maharashtra Institute of Mental Health 1991, a state level training and research institute in Mental Health Sciences, located in Pune.
 
 Stressing on empathy in treating patients, Luktuke said there were insufficient number of mental healthcare experts. Lukutuke's ‘Prajit’ foundation is first self-help group in Pune. 
 
 The common thread that bound all three experts was their love for arts, literature and drama which, according to them, helped them in their patient-care skills and made them better therapists.
