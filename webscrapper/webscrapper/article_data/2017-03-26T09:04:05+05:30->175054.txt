LUCKNOW: Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and   national president   said on Saturday that the party's alliance with Congress would continue. 

 Speaking to TOI following the party's national executive meeting here, Akhilesh said the effort to find out what went wrong in the Assembly elections is an ongoing process. "The national executive meeting was to discuss the party's future and prepare a roadmap," said Akhilesh.
 
 We will embark on a membership drive from April 15 for two months to expand the party's base, he added.
 
 Asked if there is an attempt to target members of a particular caste in the state police force, Akhilesh said "it is for media to see why this is happening."
 
 "Some people in the meat trade are being harassed unnecessarily. I heard that even the lions and tigers in zoos and safaris are going hungry. There is nothing new in this move. Samajwadi Party government had declared that NSA would be slapped on those indulging in cow smuggling or slaughter. But, there was no crisis as we acted against criminals. But now, genuine meat traders are feeling the heat.
 
 Commenting on the anti-Romeo Squad of  , Akhilesh said the government is taking away the freedom of young people. "What's so novel about police booking a man teasing a girl? It's the job of the police. But if a boy is leisurely walking in a mall or market why should he be harassed pulled up? Every young person has the right to live with dignity and respect," said Akhilesh.
 
  "The new chief minister has said in Parliament that he is a year elder to me. Who umar mein mere se bade ho sakte hain lekin kaam mein nahi (He may be senior to me in age, but behind in work). I have done a lot for UP," said Akhilesh. "I heard that cows are being brought to the official residence of the chief minister. When I was there, a herd of peacock lived with me. I would request those peacock should be protected.
