VADODARA: In past one month, rural police has seized   (IMFL) worth lakhs of rupees. However, except in one seizure case, the police is clueless about the kingpins.

  In most cases, only the carriers of the liquor stock have been nabbed. This is mainly because the kingpins change their   after a consignment is seized.
 
 The police believes that it is difficult to reach till the kingpin as there is a big chain involved. “We arrest the driver of the truck and the cleaner who are carrying the alcohol but even they do not know about the ownership of the liquor stock,” said a police inspector. Sources said that the drivers are instructed on the phone from where to pick up the truck and from whom. “Even proper name of person who gets the stock loaded in the truck is not told to the driver. Just a pseudonym is given and the colour of the person’s clothes are told to the drivers,” said an official.
 
 After the seizure, the police tries to reach till the kingpin on the basis of the registration of the truck. The police official said that after questioning the truck’s owner they reach out to the person next in line, but even he is not the main accused. “There is a chain involved, one person sitting on top of the other and so on. Because of this modus operandi of theirs, they are able to push the illicit liquor in the state,” said the official. He added that there are chances that big guns are involved in this.
 
 Recently, the local crime branch (LCB) arrested Vikramsinh Chavda for ferrying alcohol in city and district. Rural police claims that they have nabbed a big bootlegger but sources in the city police believe that Chavda is just like any other bootlegger and there are many on top of him.
 
 In past one month alone, the police have seized liquor worth valued at more than Rs 25 lakh in different hauls.
