Vadodara: BJP’s   MP Dr Subramaniam Swamy, who had courted controversy earlier for calling Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) teachers and students ‘naxalites’, once again slammed the varsity terming it a ‘pagalkhana’ (mad house).

 Talking to media persons at the sidelines of techno-fest ‘Footprints X7’ on Sunday, he said, “Those who talk of dividing the country and removing one state of the nation and giving it to somebody else, should be termed as ‘pagals’. JNU is surely a pagalkhana.”
 
 Swamy also hit out at   scion   being considered as a youth leader by his party. “How can Rahul Gandhi be called a youth leader? A youth is someone whose age is between 17 years to 35 years,” he said.
 
 On the recent Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) poll outcome, he said that the   and Shiv Sena should forge a post-poll alliance in Mumbai and that he would work towards help build this partnership.
 
 “BJP and Shiv Sena must join hands as they are Hindutva blood brothers. I will get to work on that. On March 4, I will be going to Mumbai again,” said Swamy, addressed students on the youth renaissance for India on the last day of the national level the festival.
 
 The three-day festival is being hosted by students of M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering.
 
 Swamy also said that those who assault or dishonour women should be publicly punished to reduce crime against women.
