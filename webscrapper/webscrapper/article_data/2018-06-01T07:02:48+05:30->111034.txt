BENGALURU: Chennamanakere Achhukattu police on Thursday registered a   against   Duniya Vijay for allegedly   from carrying out their duty.

 On Wednesday evening, police officials from Tavarakere station in Ramanagara arrived at the house of film producer Sundar P Gowda, and served him a non-bailable warrant from a Ramanagara court.
 
 Sundar was one of the accused in a case where two budding actors had drowned in Thippagondanahalli reservoir, during a movie shoot in October 2017. He had failed to appear before court during the trial hearings. Taking his absence seriously, the court had issued an NBW warrant, directing cops to arrest him.
 
 “Duniya Vijay was with Sundar when police arrived at the latter’s residence. On learning about the purpose of their visit, Vijay wasted time conversing with the police, and taking advantage of it, Sundar escaped from the house. Vijay promised police that he would produce Sundar before the jurisdictional police on Thursday morning. When Sundar failed to turn up at the station, the cops filed a complaint under sections IPC 353 (Obstructing government official from carrying out duty) and 225 (Resistance or obstruction to lawful apprehension of another person),” police said.
 
 Police said the sections are not major ones, and the accused actor can obtain bail at the station itself.

The chargesheet submitted by police lists among the accused, director Naga Shekhar, producer Sundar P Gowda, stunt director Ravi Varma, assistant director Siddharth, unit manager Bharath and helicopter pilot Prakash Biradar.
