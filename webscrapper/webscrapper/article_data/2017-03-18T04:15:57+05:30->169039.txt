GHAZIABAD: Members of the Federation of Apartment Owners Association (FedAOA) and residents of Ahinsa Khand 2 in   have alleged that following the tiff between   officials and FedAoA members in a meeting on Thursday, the GDA has disrupted maintenance-related services in the areas around the residential societies.

 Alleging that it was a result of their having levelled corruption charges against Chakresh Jain, GDA executive engineer, members said that several services like supply of Ganga water and clearing of blockage in sewer connections have been suspended in the area.
 
 On his part, Jain refuted the allegations of the FedAOA members, calling them “a sham and publicity stunt for gaining attention”.
 
 “They are unnecessarily trying to malign my reputation and are conducting a propaganda campaign to tarnish my image. They can take whatever measures they want, I will come clean,” Jain said.
 
 Jain also denied that maintenance services were suspended in Ahinsa Khand 2. “No such step has been taken by GDA. Please go and verify on your own what services have stopped. We have not stopped any services.”
 
 A delegation of FedAOA members had met GDA vice-chairman Vijay Yadav on Thursday and alleged that GDA officials in charge of super-sucker machines have been demanding bribes when asked to clear the accumulated sewage water from the township.
 
 In February last year, a bench of the Allahabad high court had issued an order asking FedAOA members to have consultations with the GDA for charting short-term and long-term measures to rid Indirapuram of the persistent sewage overflow problem. A series of meetings had been held between GDA officials and the FedAOA thereafter.
 
 D K Maurya, president of FedAoA, said they were preparing a contempt petition which will be filed against the GDA for its defiance of a previous high court order to sort out sewer-related problems in Ahinsa Khand 2.
