JAIPUR: Success of   production in the state has given a reason to the agriculture department to be upbeat but it has left farmers high and dry. Reason: There are no takers of their produce. The crop was sowed in 11 districts as pilot project.

 For the first time the state experimented with quinoa and provided 1,000 kits to farmers from Ajmer, Udaipur, Kota and Jodhpur division. According to agriculture minister,  , production of it is expected to be five quintal per bigha and overall production may even exceed 2,000 quintal.
 
 But farmers who have produced quinoa are not a happy lot. “Production is certainly good but then who will buy it,” questions a farmer from Bhilwara. According to him officials assured a buyback guarantee scheme for quinoa in cooperation with export companies. “But now as harvest is set to start, these assurances remain only on papers,” added the official.
 
 Department officials claim that government is in talks with firms who will buy quinoa from farmers and process it. “An agreement will be signed with the companies and talks have been finalized with one of them. Soon these firms will start buying the crop from farmers. Even government will also buy crop to stock it for seeds,” said an official.
 
 Quinoa belongs to species chenopodium album, which is commonly known as 'bathua' in the country. It is a rabi crop. Its botanical name is Chenopodium Quinoa. The seed of quinoa is used in preparing various kinds of dishes, soups and chapati.
 
 Citing the   report the agriculture minister   said, “There was a research that stated that daily consumption of quinoa can benefit patients suffering from heart diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases and other chronic diseases.”
 
 Daily consumption of 35 grams of quinoa can help in controlling diabetes and reduces risk of cancer by 15%. In patients with chronic diseases, it decreases the risk of death by 15%, the minister added.
