CHENNAI: A teacher at a school near   is in trouble for beating up a Class 4 schoolgirl who scored low marks in a recent examination, police said on Thursday.

 Kavitha’s* wrists were swollen after receiving a caning from English teacher   on Wednesday. School officials, who saw the Kavitha’s injuries, informed her parents and sent her home early in the evening.
 
 The girl’s father Ravi, who works as an MTC conductor, rushed his daughter to the Kancheepuram Government Hospital before approaching the school officials and lodging a formal complaint against the teacher and the school with the Kancheepuram Town police.
 
 Doctors examined Kavitha, who studies at a private school in   village, 15km from Kancheepuram, said the student’s condition is now stable.
 
 Prema told Kancheepuram Town police inspector   that she beat a few students because she was upset with their performance in the exam and wanted them to do better. The principal also clarified that the teacher had made a mistake.
 
 The teacher and school officials sought an unconditional apology from the student and her parents. But some school officials told investigators that certain politicians had “twisted the issue” to malign the school.
