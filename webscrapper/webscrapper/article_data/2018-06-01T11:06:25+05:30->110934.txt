VADODARA: In 2008 she was found in a train that stopped at Surat railway station.   Patel was just four-years-old when the railway police personnel noticed her alone in the Udaipur-Bandra Express. She told the cops that she was a resident of Vadodara and since then the cops have been searching for her parents and relatives here.

 
 But, much to the cop’s surprise, no one knows the girl or her parents in the area where she claimed to have stayed. “When Anjali was found by the railway cops, she told them that she stayed in Ektanagar in Akota. The cops had brought her to the city soon after she was found but she couldn’t recall the exact location of her house,” said Saroj  , DCP (crime).
 
 Anjali was sent to Children Home For Girls but the Surat police kept writing to Vadodara police for locating the girl’s house. “We sent teams of policemen to Ektanagar on Ajwa Road and in Fatehgunj to search for Anjali’s parents. We showed childhood photographs of the girl in the entire neighbourhood in those areas but no one recognized her,” Kumari told TOI.
 
 Anjali told police that her mother’s name is   and sister’s name is Megha. But these names too didn’t ring a bell with people living in   colony in Fatehgunj, Ajwa Road apart from Akota. The police also scanned all the missing persons report in the city but couldn’t find any matching description. Anjali had claimed that her parents got down at Vadodara railway station. But the railway police in Vadodara or Surat didn’t get any call or complaint of a missing child.
 
 Police suspects that her parents may have abandoned her. “Anjali, who is 14-years-old now, wants to return to the city and trace her parents. njali will be brought to the city and taken to the area where she claimed to live,” Kumari added.
