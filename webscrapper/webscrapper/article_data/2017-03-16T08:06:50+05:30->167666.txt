HYDERABAD:   Dr C Laxma Reddy faced some unexpected heat from his party colleague in the   on Wednesday when   from Mahbubnagar, V Srinivas Goud, demanded an answer to what the government was doing to put an end to private hospitals performing   on gullible patients.

 It was during the Question Hour at Assembly that Srinivas Goud raised this issue of needless surgeries.
 
 “During a visit to a hamlet in my constituency , I saw that eight of the 14 men from that village as well as some children had unnecessary surgeries, including appendectomies. I also know of many hapless women who had their uterus removed even when there was no need for such a drastic surgery ,“ he said.
 
 “What are the provisions in the law to prevent such money-making by private hospitals? Has any action been taken against such hospitals so far?“ he asked.
 
 Goud then wanted to know why the government, instead of nailing the `culprits' who were performing unnecessary surgeries when no such surgery was actually required, was keeping tab on hospitals for parking violations and other such factors.
 
 “I brought these issues twice to the notice of the prin cipal secretary of the health department but no action has been taken so far,“ he said.
 
 Laxma Reddy later, agreed that it was true that needless surgeries, including C-sections on women, were being carried out in the state that includes appendectomies and hysterectomies.
 
 “We have taken action against such hospitals,“ the minister said, and added, “The Medical Council of India has taken action against eight hospitals for discrepancies.The health department also took action.“
