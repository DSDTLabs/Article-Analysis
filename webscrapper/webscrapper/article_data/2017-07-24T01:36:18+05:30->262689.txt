GREATER NOIDA: There were four men, four women and a four-year-old boy travelling from Jewar to   in the   when the crime took place on the night of May 25. They herded the family to a nearby field and started assaulting them. When they resisted, the criminals pointed a gun at the four-year-old, the son of the scrap dealer who was shot dead by the accused. “They said, ‘We will shoot him dead if any of you makes a noise’,” the scrap dealer’ brother-in-law told TOI.

 The little boy, who prefers to keep quite most of the time after the incident, is still shocked at what happened to his family that day. Unable to understand why the criminals held his family hostage, he said, “They took us to the field at night. It was all dark. They pointed a gun at me but my father put up resistance and warned them against harming me. The criminals then shot my father dead in front of my eyes for no reason.”
 
 The scrap dealer’s brother-in-law said they were surrounded by six men, who were armed with guns, knives and rods. . “They snatched our mobile phones, purses and whatever jewellery the women had on them. When they started groping the women, we resisted. My brother-in-law (the scrap dealer) put up a resistance. The criminals first fired a bullet at the ground and then shot him in the chest,” he said.
