AMARAVATI: Pandemonium prevailed in the state assembly on Tuesday as opposition members belonging to the   kept on disrupting the proceedings for one reason or the other. Heated arguments were witnessed when both the ruling and opposition benches traded charges against each other. Speaker Kodela Siva Prasada Rao had to adjourn the house several times following the din. 

 Tempers ran high during the discussion on budget when YSRC member Buggana Rajendranath Reddy alleged that no deal made by the government looked transparent. He said finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu made several contradictory statements in his budget speech and no evidence has been placed before the house to support his argument. He said the budget figures were nothing but mix of English wordplay and incorrect information.
 
 Angrily reacting to Rajendranath's statement, labour minister Acthannaidu said that they need no lessons from the party which looted the state in the past. He said that Jaganmohan Reddy was chiefly responsible for industrialists and IAS officers going to jail. "He misused the office of his father YS Rajasekhara Reddy and looted the state.   filed 11 charge-sheets stating that Jagan had amassed 43,000 crore through illegal means. Now, they are levelling baseless charges against us," fumed Atchannaidu. 
 
 The minister's response led to angry protests by the opposition members who demanded that the speaker not allow such statements to go into the records.
