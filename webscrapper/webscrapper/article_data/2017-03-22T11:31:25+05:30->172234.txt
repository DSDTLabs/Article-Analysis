Sona and Suhana are going back in the car. Suhana doesn't speak thinking about Sona and Dev rejecting her wish to stay together. Ishwari panics after Radha brainwashes her that Sona will soon be back in Dev's life.
 
  Dev comes back and tells them how he said no to Suhana when she asked something from him for the first time. He tells Ishwari about Suhana's demand and Ishwari gets jealous.
  
  Suhana reaches home and starts telling Bejoy about the camp and papa. Bejoy fumes after knowing that Suhana has started calling Dev as her father.
  
  
 
  
  Dev is feeling sad that he couldn't fulfill Suhana's wish and blames himself. Golu sees him sad and calls Suhana to know about how she is feeling. Suhana doesn't tell him anything and hangs up.
  
  Next day, before dropping Golu to school, Dev goes to meet Suhana. Sona tells him that he didn't talk to anyone and left for school already. The two decide to go and meet her.
  
  They reach the school and see Suhana sitting on a bench silently.
  
  In the office, Dev can't stop thinking about Suhana. He tells Sona that he is worried about Suhana and wants to fix this soon. They both reach school. Golu comes out and tells them that Suhana didn't talk to anyone, didn't eat and for the first time got scolded by the teacher. Both get more concerned.
