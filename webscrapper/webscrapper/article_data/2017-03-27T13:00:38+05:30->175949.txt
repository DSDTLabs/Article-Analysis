There's another delightful news to the fans of megastar Chiranjeevi, who is bouncing at the big screen with lucrative projects in hand.

 After making a grand re-entry to the silver screen, Chiranjeevi is upbeat about reviving his career in films with his 151 project already on cards. Titled ' ', the story of a freedom fighter is going to be told in this project, under the direction of Surender Reddy.
 
 Another detail about the movie's development is something that excites the actor's fans and Telugu moviegoers. The makers-supposedly, Ram Charan, who is again shouldering the responsibilities of a producer for this flick to,o has reportedly approached Bollywood action king   to be part of it, for a crucial role.
 
 We are not sure if this bit of news is true, though. Meanwhile, Akshay has already shot for his role as an antogonist in Rajinikanth starrer- '2.0', sequel to 'Robo', which is gearing up for a huge release across the globe very soon. 
 
 If Akshay is roped in for a Telugu movie, be it for any role if that matters, the level of Indian cinema jumps to another mile, hinting at a very good rapport of actors and film makers coming together for multi-lingual projects.
 
 Let us hope this idea materialises and await for the official confirmation.
