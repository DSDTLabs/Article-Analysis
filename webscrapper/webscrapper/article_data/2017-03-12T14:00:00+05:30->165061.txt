Past one year has been a roller-coaster ride for   Narsingh Yadav, who qualified for   and then faced a substance abuse charge, leading to life ban just before his scheduled bout at Olympics. “Amidst all this mayhem, I could stay sane because of my family’s support and love of Shilpi Sheoran, a fellow wrestler. And now that she has become my life partner, I can face anything,”says the besotted groom.

 
 Narsingh, who got married to Shilpi recently in Mumbai in a traditional ceremony, says that he has known his ladylove for more than a year. He adds, “I fell in love with her because she is a very caring girl and understands me completely. She is a naval officer’s daughter and has done her masters in English literature. The best part is that she supports me completely. Last one year was the darkest phase of my life. And it was Shilpi’s love that kept me going in this toughest phase. If my family and Shilpi were not there, I would have been completely lost.”
 
 
 Since both Shilpi and Narsingh are into wrestling, he feels it will make things easier for both of them to pursue their common passion. Narsingh adds, “I want Shilpi to qualify for next Olympics. And once my ban is lifted after the CBI investigation gives me a clean chit, both of us will try our best to win medals for the country. As it is I’m practising hard every single day.”
 
 
 Ask him how far has the CBI investigation progressed and the wrestler says, “It is in its final stage. I’m waiting for the verdict now. I’m sure that I will get a clean chit and then I will go ahead and participate in all the competitions along with Shilpi.”
