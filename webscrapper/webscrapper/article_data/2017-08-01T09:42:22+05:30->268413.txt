PUNE: A   died and three of his friends were critically injured as a speeding pick-up van hit them, barely a few minutes after they had rescued two   victims on the slushy Mulshi-Kolad road on Sunday afternoon.

 Lakhan Jagdhane, a resident of Hadapsar, died on the spot and his friends — Babalu Pimple, Rahul Jadhav and Gokul Mohote —are undergoing treatment in a private hospital in Pune.
 
 Police have arrested the pick-up van driver, Adesh Pawar (28) of Raigad district, for causing death due to negligence and rash driving, inspector (Paud) Suresh Nimbalkar said on Monday. Jagdhane’s friend, Umesh Harihar, had lodged a complaint with the Paud police.
 
 Narayan More, sub-inspector of Paud police who is probing the case, Jagdhane and his friends from Hadapsar had gone to Tamhini to enjoy the rain. “Around 11.30am, they reached near a restaurant at Gonvadi village, about 46km from here. It was there they spotted a couple lying on the road after their motorcycle skidded,” More said.
 
 “Jagdhane and his friends parked their car near the restaurant and got down to help the couple, who were in a state of shock. They calmed down the couple and helped them on their onward ride to Pune,” More said.
 
 As Jagdhane and his friends reached their car and were about to board it, a pick-van speeding towards Tamhini knocked down a Pune-bound vehicle. 
 
 “The van veered off course under the impact of the collision and knocked down Jagdhane and his three friends. All of them were taken to a nearby hospital, where Jagdhane was declared dead by the doctors,” More said.
 
 The spot where the accident occurred has a slope and prima facie probe revealed that the pick-up van driver had lost control over the vehicle. “The driver, Pawar, said the brakes of his vehicle failed. We will get an inspection of the vehicle done by the Regional Transport Office,” Nimbalkar said.
