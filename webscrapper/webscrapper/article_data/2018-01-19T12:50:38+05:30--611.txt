COIMBATORE: There has been an increase in number of students taking to drugs due to surge in representation of drinking and smoking in movies and visual media, say schoolteachers from the city.

 Around 40 teachers from government and private schools attended a capacity building programme on children affected by drug abuse in the city on Thursday. On the sidelines of the programme, the teachers said the availability of liquor and tobacco products has become easier for students now. “Petty shops near schools use one student as a courier to sell tobacco products to several other students,” said a schoolteacher from the city.
 
 In the absence of such products, students find new ways to abuse easily available substances like glue and petrol, added another schoolteacher.
 
 Schoolteachers also said they find several students to come drunk or under the influence of tobacco products to the class. “Once we found a student using a specific tobacco product. When we investigated, we found out that the student’s mother had been using the same product. She didn’t know that it was a drug,” the teacher added.
 
 The only way out is to counsel students, say teachers. Government schoolteachers say there has to be one counsellor in every government school. “If there is one such person in every school, they would counsel students individually and it would be more effective,” said another teacher.
 
 M Punitha, head of social work department,   and a former member of the  , said in their surveys in schools on the outskirts of the city, several teachers were clueless on how to deal with students who involve in drug abuse. “There should be counsellors in schools who would deal with such issues,” she added.
