LUCKNOW: Centre's approval to the premature repartition of senior IPS officer OP   for taking over as the UP DGP reflects cheif minister  's growing assertiveness and clout in the party. Despite a delay of 22 days,   held his ground and the Centre had to concede to his demand for relieving Singh from   charge.

 However, there was no immediate movement to hold the meeting of the appointments committee of cabinet (ACC), headed by the PM, which takes a call on officers' premature repartition. As days passed by there were speculations that the RSS was not in favour of appointing OP Singh as he was perceived 'anti-Dalit' - he was Lucknow SSP when there was an attack on BSP leader   in June 1995 at Meerabai Marg's guest house after her party pulled out of the coalition government. Besides, it would have also been projected as an overt Thakur card by Yogi government.
 
 As OP Singh's repartition was being delayed, there were talks that he might be replaced. However, Yogi government didn't sent any new name as a replacement. Rather, a high-powered delegation was sent CM on January 19 to convince the PMO to relieve the candidate of his choice. The perseverance paid off and Singh was relieved on Sunday. 
 
 A few days back, he appointed retired IAS officer   as the new state election commissioner. There were half a dozen names in fray - most of them backed by the RSS and the Centre, but Adityanath chose Manoj Kumar who had been posted in different capacities in the eastern UP.
 
 Of late, the CM has shown an assertive self while taking several decisions -   in Ayodhya, attending conferences of the saints and seers in Ayodhya and Prayag , leading the campain in urban local bodies elections and challenging rivals CMs in Twitter war.
