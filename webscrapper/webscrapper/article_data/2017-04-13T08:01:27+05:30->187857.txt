BHOPAL: Beware! If you are boarding a train from Bhopal, you must know that the summer for   railway division starts from April 1. And, this is not an April Fool’s Day joke. Following an old rule, Bhopal division of railways considers April 1 to be the first day of the summer. What’s worse is, the ACs of the passenger waiting rooms lie unrepaired if it bites the dust before March departs.

 The waiting room AC on Platform 1, which has at least 50,000 footfalls every day, of Bhopal station went out of order. And, of course it lay unrepaired till April 1. In case the mercury soars early, like this year, the machines are fixed only after its summer officially. 
 
 Still better, the plea of the passengers was taken seriously only in the first week this month. The officials are the worst hit. For them, the coolers have not yet arrived and they are beating the heat only with slanting table fans fixed on walls. 
 
 Shailesh Saxena, SS Commercial,  , said, “Despite the summer arriving early this year, the railways stuck to its traditional April 1 date.” “The plea of the passengers fell in deaf ears,” he said, blaming the electrical department responsible for delay in providing ACs.
 
 Now, the ACs in the waiting rooms have been fixed. The officials, however, have been left bear the brunt,” he said.
 
 Anil Malviya, senior section engineer, electrical department, said: “According to rules, the summer season starts from April 1. The arrangements start only after April 1, because of which there was a delay the repair work. The arrangements will be removed on June 15, as the heat starts melting officially. These rules bind us even as the weather is hot after June 15.”
 
 “This year none of the contractors were ready to apply for the tender before the due date. No one even supplied the coolers. Now we will go through quotation and allot some company to get the coolers installed.”
