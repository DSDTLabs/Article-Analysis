AHMEDABAD: Ghatlodia police on Friday recorded a complaint for abetment of suicide against the sister-in-law and other in-laws of a man who died almost one year ago.

 Ghatlodia police said  , a resident of   in Ghatlodia, had jumped out of the lobby of an upper floor at about 12.30pm on August 26, 2016, to end his life. From his pockets, investigators found a note reading “26/8/16, Mere maut ka karan Sansilp Vashwani And All Chabbaria family” (sic).
 
 The note was sent to DFS to ascertain if it was indeed written by Rupesh. As the opinion has affirmed the contention,  , a resident of Sarjan Tower, and the younger brother of the deceased, registered the complaint for abetment to suicide.
 
 “In his complaint, Jitendra said that Rupesh’s sister-in-law   had sent her son Nikhil to their shop ‘Daya Creations’ near Sarangpur to learn the basics of the textile business. Nikhil had left the shop after about three months due to some differences. The incident had created a rift between Rupesh and his in-laws,” said an investigator.
 
 Jitendra said that their behaviour had allegedly driven Rupesh to end his life.
