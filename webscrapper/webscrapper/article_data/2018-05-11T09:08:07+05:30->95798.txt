CHENNAI: As   dilly-dallied in proposing a solution to the problem faced by aspiring engineering students, from rural areas, who faced difficulties in remitting the fee for online counselling, the   has suggested the university to rope in a credit card company that can collect money from students and remit them online. As of now, payment can be done only through credit, debit cards or internet banking.

 
 A vacation bench of   and Justice P D   made the suggestion and directed the additional advocate-general   to get instructions from the university on the possibilities of implementing the proposal.
 
 The issue pertains to a batch of pleas seeking a direction to the university to conduct counselling for engineering courses in online and offline modes. When they came up for hearing on Wednesday, the bench made it clear that the university cannot expect rural students to remit the fee only through the three modes of payment, as the chances of them having access to a bank account in itself was doubtful.
 
 On Thursday morning, the additional advocate-general informed the court that the university would consider accepting the payment through demand draft and sought time to confirm the same with the university authorities. However, the additional advocate-general later informed the court that payment through DD was not possible, as online system would permit access to login only after successful payment of the fee.
 
 To this, the court suggested that a credit card company could be requested to open counters at the facilitation centres and accept cash payment from students that, in turn, can be remitted on their behalf online. The bench then directed the additional advocate-general to get instructions from the university on the suggestion and posted the pleas to Friday for further hearing.
