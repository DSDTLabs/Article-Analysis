The Standing Fire Advisory Council ( ), a Central government body, has roped in Bollywood actor   as the brand ambassador of fire services in India. 

 "Every service has a brand ambassador, likewise we decided to have our own. The SFAC and the Union Government approached the actor, who is already associated with the Mumbai fire brigade, to be the face of fire services," P S Rahangdale, Chief Fire Officer of Mumbai Fire Brigade, said.
 
 "Hooda has agreed to be our brand ambassador. The actor will be part of our various fire safety campaigns in future," he said. 
 
 The decision to make Hooda the brand ambassador was taken at the two-day 38th meeting of the SFAC, which began here today. SFAC is the apex body set up by the Centre to advise on fire service-elated matters. 
 
 During the meeting, it was also decided that a national-level fire drill competition be held in Mumbai. 
 
 "So far, there is no national-level sports or drill competition for fire brigade. This time, I have taken the initiative to organise fire drill competition in Mumbai," Rahangdale said. 
 
 There is a recommendation to modernise various fire-fighting equipment. 
 
 "Presently, the pay structure of the fire services personnel varies in every state. Even the designations of similar rank differ state-wise. Hence, there is a demand for uniform designations and pay structure across the states," the officer said. 
 
 The meeting will also discuss guidelines for compensation and martyr status to the firemen, the senior fire official said. 
 
 Director General of Fire services, Prakash Mishra, was present at the meeting.
