The Congress has decided to attend the Assembly on   day but raise voice against the   of TDP legislators. The party had initially decided to boycott the budget, but later changed its strategy. 

 A meeting was held on Sunday in which senior leaders said that boycotting the annual budget, that too over the suspension of MLAs of another party, would send the wrong signals to the people. “After consultations, it was decided to attend the session and protest,” PCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy told TOI. 
 
 They also decided to expose the ‘lies’ in the governor’s speech and demand the resignation of KCR. The CM on Saturday had dared the   to show one wrong statement in the governor’s speech and said he would resign in five minutes if the opposition succeeded.
 
 “We have identified several mistakes and wrong statements in the speech and will give it to media on Monday. Let us see how truthful the chief minister will be to keep his word on resignation,” said Uttam Kumar. Congress has also decided to raise its objection over allowing defected MLA Puvvada Ajay Kumar to speak against the Congress in the House. Ajay recently shifted loyalty to TRS.
 
 The BJP has also decided to attend the assembly on budget day, but to insist on revocation of the suspension of TDP members. They will ask the speaker to reduce the suspension to one or two days instead of the whole session. tnn
