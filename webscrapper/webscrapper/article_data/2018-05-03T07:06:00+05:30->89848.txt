Ludhiana: Police have booked a woman, her mother, and two brothers on charges of abetment to suicide of a pick-up van driver — Mandeep Kumar (37) from Jawahar Nagar — who consumed poison on Tuesday evening. Before taking the extreme step, Mandeep — in a video recording — had accused the four for his death. On the complaint of Mandeep’s sister, Meenu Kumari of Choti Jawaddi, Division No.5 police have registered a case against Mandeep’s wife Seema Rani, her mother Neelam Rani, and her two brothers — Deepak Kumar and Goldy — under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC.

 Complainant Meenu said her brother got married to Seema 15 years ago, and had two sons aged 15 and 8. She said: “Mandeep was a driver and the family was living hand to mouth. He had taken a loan of Rs 5 lakh from a bank to buy his pick-up van, and he was finding it difficult to pay the monthly instalment. At the same time, his wife was harassing him to give her money for maintaining a good lifestyle. This was the reason for fights between husband and wife.” Further, she accused Seema of harassing Mandeep by demanding money every other day. Her brothers and mother would also scold Mandeep for not giving Seema enough money, following which Mandeep committed suicide by consuming poison.
 
 The in-charge at Kochar Market police post, ASI Kulwant Chand, said earlier also, Mandeep’s sister had approached the police with a complaint against Seema for harassing him. However, every time they settled on a compromise. The official added that before committing suicide, Mandeep recorded a video on his phone, and named his wife, mother-in-law, and two brothers-in-law for harassing him and forcing him to take the extreme stop of ending his life. So far, no arrest has been made in the case.
