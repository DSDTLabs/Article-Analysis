NEW DELHI: More trouble could be in store for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) looking at seven matters referred to it by former   ( )   after the submission of the Shunglu committee report.
 
  A senior CBI official told   on condition of anonymity that seven matters had been referred to it for probe, out of which FIRs had been registered in two matters and a preliminary enquiry marked into another one.
  
  All these matters had emerged from the Shunglu committee report and CBI was “looking into” the four other matters before taking a decision, the official said.
  
  The two FIRs are said to be the ones lodged by the CBI recently against Delhi AAP MLA and former Chief of the Delhi Waqf Board Amatullah Khan and another in the appointment of Nikunj Aggarwal as officer on special duty (OSD) to Delhi   Minister Satyendra Jain. The CBI official did not disclose the particulars of the other five matters, one of which has also led to a preliminary enquiry.
  
  After scrutinising 400 files pertaining to decisions taken by the AAP government, the Shunglu committee is said to have observed that there has been a “colourable exercise of power” on the part of AAP government and had pointed to some serious and glaring irregularities, sources say.
  
  The report was submitted to then LG Najeeb Jung on November 27 and is yet to be made public. Jung had set up the Shunglu committee in August after the Delhi HC ruled that the LG is the administrative head of Delhi and declared decisions taken by Delhi government without consulting the LG illegal.
