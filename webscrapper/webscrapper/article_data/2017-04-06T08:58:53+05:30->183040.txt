LUCKNOW: After a spate of attacks on them, the   is finding it difficult to reassure liquor traders of their safety. In Lucknow, 109 license holders out of 203 affected after the Supreme Court’s order had approached the excise department saying they wanted to open a shop 500 metres away from highway.

 The order banned liquor vends within 500 metres of a highway. 
 
 “Such shops owners are finding it difficult to operate. Local villagers are grouping up to mount pressure on local police to uproot these licensee shops,” said district excise officer J B Yadav.
 
 A total of 866   were operating in the city before the ban on highway liquor vending. These include model shops, IMFL shops, beer bars and country-made liquor shops. A total of 203 shops have been affected. 
 
 On Wednesday, the excise department asked officials to carry out a fresh survey and find out if   or old shops were facing a threat from the public. “We have been asked to submit a report to the government in this regard,” said Yadav.
