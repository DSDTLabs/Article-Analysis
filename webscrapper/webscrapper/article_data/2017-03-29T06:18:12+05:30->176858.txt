PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A woman returned to the   on Tuesday to claim the body of her dead baby girl, a week after abandoning her in the hospital. 

 MM Deshmukh, superintendent of the civic-run hospital, said, “The baby girl was born at the hospital on March 9 and had to be shifted to the ICU due to respiratory problems. She died on March 22 and the mother left the hospital in the night without informing anybody. The body was kept in the mortuary.”
 
 Assistant inspector   of the Pimpri police said, “The hospital’s administration told us to trace the baby’s parents on Sunday. We tried to locate them with the help of cellphone number, but it was switched off. By the time we realised that the cellphone had been switched on on Tuesday afternoon, the baby’s mother,   (35), reached the hospital to claim the body.”
 
 Kale told the police that she had gone to Satara to attend the last rites of her mother-in-law and that since she’s too poor, she had to borrow money to return to Pimpri. She said she was not in a position to take back the body for the last rites and sought help for the same. The last rites were later performed at a crematorium near Chinchwad.
