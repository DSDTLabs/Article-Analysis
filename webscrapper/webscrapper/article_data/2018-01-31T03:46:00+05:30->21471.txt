NAVI MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday gave   nod to   Pvt Ltd (NMSEZ) to apply for   of its   status.

 Cidco MD Bhushan Gagrani told TOI that NMSEZ will apply to the Centre for denotification as except for IT SEZ, others were not viable owing to lack of incentives. The formal denotification will convert its status to integrated industrial area (IIA ) under the 2013 state industrial policy. 
 
 Gagrani said, “Bringing all 100% export oriented industries was not possible. However, under IIA, different industries, small, medium and big and service industry, would be set up. The role of the company would be akin to Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) on its land.” The venture would earn revenue through infrastructure development, sub leasing of land and renting out premises—85% of land can be used for industries and 15% for residential purpose.
 
 The denotification throws open 1,842 hectares—at Dronagiri, Ulwe and Kalamboli in Navi Mumbai—for development. Only 80 hectares of the SEZ has IT and IT-enabled industry. One of the pockets, measuring 162 hectares, in Ulwe abuts the south boundary wall of the upcoming Navi Mumbai international airport.
 
 Gagrani had forwarded a letter to the urban development department in January seeking change in the nature of the zone as stakeholders did not find the SEZ model profitable. 
 
 Cidco, the nodal agency, has 26 % equity while Dronagiri Infrastructure, a group of companies, has 74% stake in NMSEZ, a special purpose vehicle set up under public–private partnership.
