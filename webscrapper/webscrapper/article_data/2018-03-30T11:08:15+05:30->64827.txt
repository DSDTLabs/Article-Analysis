 According to the Union home ministry records, Gujarat has over 2,500 NDPS cases pending before different courts, while only 162 convictions have come till 2016.

Dr  , who works at a rehabilitation centre in the city, said that use of narcotics substance has become rampant among he youngsters and overdose of such substances may lead to heart failures and serious respiratory disorder.
 
 “I come across 10 to 15 cases in a month of youngsters addicted to ganja, hashish or brown sugar. Their parents want them to get rid of their addiction. In many cases, they come from urban areas like Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara,” said Anand. Sources in Narcotics Control Bureau ( ) said that seizures have increased in Gujarat as the state is also used by drug peddlers as a route to supply narcotics to neighbouring state of Maharashtra.
 
 “In Punjab, use of ganja, hashish and heroin has decreased and addicts have started using codeine-based cough syrups. This has happened due to strict implementation of law. On the other hand, Gujarat is still a hotbed for supplying ganja and hashish,” said a source in the NCB.
