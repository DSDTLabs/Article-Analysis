At a time when the suicides of school and college students for various reasons like sexual exploitation and performance pressure in education are no more news in Kerala, actor   has made the issue the topic for his latest blog post.

 The megastar, who says that 'there is no point in even advising people who resort to the torture of children - all I would say is that they should get the ultimate punishment,' however, has a few words of advice for the younger generation. He says, rather than choosing to end life when trapped in a situation of exploitation, our youngsters should try their best to boldly face them and finde solutions. 'I understand the stress levels you are subjected to while going through such episodes. However, if you don't bring your tormentors before law, they would continue doing the same, even without getting punished, and may be even torture more people."
 
 He ends the blog saying, 'I wonder who or what would emerge a savior for kids who are subjected to exploitation, and I haven't got an answer to this concern yet."
