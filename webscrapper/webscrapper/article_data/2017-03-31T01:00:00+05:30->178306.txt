Immersive is how one would describe the music that   and   create. Their outfit, ' ', is a rather interesting collaboration between classically-trained vocalist Pavithra and keyboardist Anindo. With influences ranging from Hindustani classical, blues, jazz and electronica, their songs are lyrically strong and completely captivate you in a live setting. Talking about it, Pavitra says, “We love playing live and we have enough confidence in our music. Just a little attention from the audience and you can get lost in the music.”
The duo, which met in 2014 and now have two albums between them, the self-titled 'Shadow and Light' and ' ', are already working on their third. Their musical style, though one may think is contradictory, considering Pavitra is a trained classical singer and Anindo has played in several rock bands in the country, fuses together quite organically. Pavitra explains, “Our music styles are worlds apart. But I feel there is a seamless connection we make, and parallels that we draw from each of our musicalities. We complement each other a lot. We are never invasive.”
 Anindo says, “The idea is to feed off the emotion. As long the emotion is portrayed, and we can connect the dots; as long as our music can drive the lyrical content of the song, it makes life easy.”
 Currently in the midst of finishing an online musical travel series, the duo say that nothing is off-limits for them, not even Bollywood. “We would love to make music for films, and we’ve thought about it quite a lot. Our music is quite visual, and we feel that given the right script, we can deliver something interesting,” signs of Anindo.
