HYDERABAD: Nearly three months after fake CBI officers looted  , RC Puram, customers who wanted their stolen   back are still waiting anxiously.

 They are ruing how   continues to remain noncommittal on when they can return their gold, even as murmurs indicate that Muthoot might not get their insured amount owing to certain loopholes.
 
 “I have visited Muthoot at least ten times after the robbery .Every time they give some lame excuse and ask me to take money instead of gold. Why should I suffer for Muthoot's mistake?
 
 There are the ones who failed to provide security. Now it is on them to give back my gold,“ said K Nagaraju, and added that Muthoot is following divide and rule policy to make people dance to their tunes.
 
 Many customers said that they will move court if Muthoot fails to return their gold as promised and if needed, they would not hesitate to stage a protest. They opined that Muthoot is trying to make money from the incident and that's the reason they are paying people instead of returning gold.
 
 Muthoot staff, meanwhile, said that they had already paid about 1,600 customers till date and would pay the remaining as soon as possible. “After deducting the loan and interest amount, we are paying the remaining amount to customers. We are also in touch with a jeweler in Lingampally. The ones who are willing to buy gold can approach him and get ornaments,“ said M Venkat Reddy, branch manager, Muthoot, RC Puram. Customers, however, are not happy with this move as they have to pay making charges and other taxes to get the ornaments made. “The moment I entered Muthoot office today, they started calculating and said that I would get a certain amount. I lost my temper as I had made it very clear that I need my ornament back at any cost and that I would not take the money. This lead to a huge fight,“ said BT Rao, who pledged about 45 grams of gold with the company.
