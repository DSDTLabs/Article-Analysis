Trichy: Central University of Tamil Nadu ( ) Tiruvarur has given away free organic manure to about 50 farmers in and around the varsity. While the idea was to sensitize the farmers about the use of organic manure and reduce the reliance on chemical fertilizer, the vermi-compost distributed to the farmers was produced with in the university by the organic waste generated from one of the canteens.

 It was a first of its-kind initiative from the university as part of the nationwide Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, with the help of Marutham self-help group. A total 100 bags of vermi-compost was handed over by CUTN vice chancellor A P Dash in a programme marked to sensitize farmers about the use of organic manure and reduce the reliance on chemical fertilizers. While it was a pilot project, the university is all set to establish a dedicated unit to produce vermi–compost while aiming at converting all the organic waste generated in the campus into manure.
 
 It was N Sivakami, a faculty from the social work department, who coined the idea after seeing the organic waste generated in the university canteen which otherwise is a potential resources, going to the drains. Sivakami did not only take up the responsibility, but ensured that the canteen that has been generating the waste is engaged in the task.
 
 “It took two months, semi-decomposed cow dung and earthworms to produce the organic manure with the help of the self-help group that is running the canteen in the university,” said N Sivakami.
 
 “The demand for vermi compost is on the rise and it sold in the market for Rs 12-15 per kg. While it took us Rs 12 per kg to produce vermi-compost, it was given free to the farmers. The operational cost is likely to come down, once we start producing it in the campus by setting up a dedicated unit,” she said.
