ALWAR: A 40-year-old father sold his 14-year-old daughter for Rs 7 lakh in   on Sunday. The girl was rescued by villagers when she began screaming for help while being forced into an SUV. Her father Balveer Singh had allegedly fixed a deal with Leeladhar Jat,   and   to sell her off.

 Police have registered an FIR against all four accused under section 363 (kidnapping) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). The minor has refused to return to her house, and requested police to let her live with her grandmother.
 
 In her complaint, she alleged that her mother was also a part of the conspiracy. The minor's parents work as daily wage labourers and her father frequently visited Haryana in search of employment, where he met the prospective 'buyers'. “Ishwar Singh told Balveer Singh that his daughter will be married to a 35-yearold wealthy person in Haryana and she will lead a happy life there. We are probing to see if the minor was brought with an intention to push her into flesh trade,“ a police officer said.
