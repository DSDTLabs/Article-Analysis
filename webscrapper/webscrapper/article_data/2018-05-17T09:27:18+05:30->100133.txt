ROHTAK: Wheat purchased by Hafed and Haryana State Warehousing Corporation but lying in the open at Meham and Kiloi grain markets of Rohtak was drenched after sudden heavy downpour lashed Rohtak district in the wee hours of Wednesday.

 In Meham grain market, about 4,000 tonnes of wheat kept in the open was soaked in the rain. Currently, no wheat is arriving in the grain market. Out of 45,000 tonnes of wheat purchased by both state agencies, nearly 40,000 tonnes has been lifted and stored. Remaining, 5,000 tonnes has been lying on an open plinth without being put in gunny bags.
 
 Commission agents at Meham grain market said wheat lay in the open as the agencies were short of gunny bags and they were not given sacks in time to save the stock from getting damaged.
 
 Meham market committee secretary   said the procurement agencies did not deliver gunny bags for storage of wheat and the produce had to be kept in the open which led to the damage of food grains due to weather vagaries. He said the drenched wheat would be dried first and then lifted to godown for storage.
 
 India meteorological department (IMD) has forecast thunderstorm with gusty winds at isolated places during over the next 72 hours in Haryana. It has also forecast light rain or thundershowers at isolated places during the next 48 hours and dry weather thereafter in the state.
