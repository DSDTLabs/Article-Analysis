Visakhapatnam: If all goes well, the port city could soon have its own   — much like the dazzling, upscale commercial junction in New York. At least that’s what Vedanta Group’s deal with the Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board promises. 

 The MoU was signed here on Monday, the concluding day of the CII Partnership Summit. The project is expected to be spread over 350 acres with an estimated minimum investment of Rs 10,000 crore.
 
 “For now, they are calling it the Vedanta Square. It will be a world-class city centre, modelled on New York city’s Times Square. It will have shopping malls, commercial spaces, five-star hotels, amusement centres etc,” J Krishna Kishore, chief executive officer (ex-officio secretary to government) of the AP Economic Development Board, told TOI. “The group wants to turn this into the country’s best infrastructure project. The final investment could well be a few billion dollars.”
 
 Asked about the location of the square, Kishore said the group has already identified the area and will disclose it shortly. He, however, confirmed that the project will take off soon, sometime in 2018, much like Vedanta’s other project — a zinc smelter plant — for an initial investment of Rs 3,500 crore. The total investment promised by the Vedanta Group during the summit is around Rs 2,400 crore.
 
 Also on the cards for   is a gaming edu-tech centre, the blueprint of which will be ready by April. “Following the MoU that the EDB and education department of AP signed with Unesco, we have had several rounds of consultations with stakeholders regarding the project. Unesco is helping us get investors. We are trying to create an ecosystem that will allow start-ups and established players to co-exist,” said Kishore. “The project is in line with the CM’s vision of turning Vizag into a gaming hub. No other state has anything like this.”
