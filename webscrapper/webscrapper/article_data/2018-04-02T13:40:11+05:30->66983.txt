VADODARA: A rag-picker living in slums near   was found murdered in bushes near Fulwadi bridge at   on Sunday morning.

 The deceased Ashok Devipujak’s body was noticed by some labourers.
 
 Devipujak’s wife Soni told police in her statement that her husband was missing since Saturday evening. She went to search for him in nearby slum areas when he did not return home till late night. However, when she could not find him, Soni assumed that he might have gone to their other home in the slums at Kalali.
 
 On Sunday morning, when Soni again went out to search for her husband, some labourers told her that they have found a body near Fulwadi bridge. On reaching there, Soni saw that it was Ashok’s. Soni then informed her family members about it and went to Fatehgunj police station.
 
 Police said that Devipujak had injuries on his forehead and near his left eye, which could have been caused by a pointed weapon.
 
 “It is difficult to find any clue right now as there is neither eye-witness nor does the family suspect anyone. We are suspecting that he could have been killed because of money,” said a police official.
 
 Devipujak is survived by a three-year-old son and an 18-month-old daughter, besides his wife.
