NEW DELHI: A driverless diesel engine   the   of Anand Vihar railway station   before   nearly 40 metres ahead on Saturday afternoon. Railway officials said that the engine was not connected to any coach and no damage or injuries were reported due to the derailment.

 Following the incident, the driver of the engine has been suspended and a high-level inquiry has been ordered to look into the cause. According to officials, the incident took place at 2.33pm with the engine coming to a halt on its own after derailing.
 
 “It occurred on an extra shunting line between platforms 1 and 2 of the station. The engine rolled on for about 40 metres before derailing at the end of the line. No injuries were reported and no train movements were affected due to the incident,” said a senior railway official.
 
 Investigation has revealed that the handbrakes of the diesel locomotive may have failed, resulting in the engine starting to roll ahead on its own.
 
 “There are dozens of locomotives which are shut down and parked each day on these tracks with their handbrakes applied. No such incident can take place if the handbrakes are gripping the track correctly. We suspect the brakes may have failed or were not applied properly and an investigation to look into it has been ordered,” said the official.
 
 Last week, an incident was reported in Orissa where 22 train coaches detached from the engine and sped backwards for several kilometres before they came to a halt. Railway officials, however, said this incident is not similar in any way. “This was simply a case of erroneous brakes and in all other cases, a driver is always onboard. The impact was reduced as it was not on any main line of the railway station,” said the official.
