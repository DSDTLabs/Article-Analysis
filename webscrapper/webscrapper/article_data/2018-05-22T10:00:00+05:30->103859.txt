It was raining ‘muahs’ at the special screening of   at a south Kolkata plex on Friday evening. Several well-known faces from different walks of life came down to catch the show. Over popcorn and colas, movie lovers were seen having a blast watching Laltu Biswas & Co. unfold a laughter riot. Once the screening drew to a close, many didn’t wait to greet directors   and   but smothered them with haamis.
 
  
 Little Brata Banerjee, who was catching the show with friends   and Aviraj Karan, said he’d rather run away before the show ends. “Cholo palai,” he said. On being asked the reason, the seven-year-old said, “Can’t you see people waiting to pull my cheeks? If they were throwing tomatoes at me, I would have been happier. This love is becoming unbearable.” Tiyasha, who was busy with her half-yearly exams, said she could finally enjoy all the love showered on her.
 
  
 Who said directors can’t be friends? Kaushik Ganguly, Sudeshna Roy and   were seen thoroughly enjoying the special screening of the film. “I am all for films that educate,” said Kaushik. Those who watched the film were all praise for the director duo’s take on the 
 education system.
 
 
  
 Tolly women Arpita Chatterjee, Nusrat Jahan, Tonushree Chakraborty and   turned up the heat at the screening. Looking chic in red and pink co-ords, Nusrat turned heads. Mimi, who has lost oodles of weight, was looking her prettiest best in a blush yellow top and black distressed jeans. Both Arpita and Tonushree made a splash in cool casuals.
