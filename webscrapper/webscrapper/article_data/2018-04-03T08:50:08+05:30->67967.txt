BHOPAL/GWALIOR: Six persons were shot dead as violence swept large parts of   during the Dalitcalled   on Monday. MP accounted for the bulk of nine deaths in the country.

 The administration seemed taken unawares by the scale and intensity of violence, especially in Gwalior, Bhind, Morena, Sagar, Balaghat and Satna districts. Curfew has been clamped in Morena and schools and colleges shut down in Gwalior. In view of the volatile atmosphere, Internet is switched off in all trouble-torn areas.
 
 Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called an emergency meeting and appealed for peace.
 
 He sent 550 sub-inspectors — fresh from passing-out parade on Monday — to the violence-hit zones.
 
 One of those killed, Bhind shopkeeper Mahaveer Rajavat, was mistakenly shot by police in the chaos and frenzy of violence. He was going to the police station to complain that bandh enforcers had forced him to shut shop in Machand. Police, who were misinformed that a group was heading to attack them, opened fire, killing Rajavat. He was cremated in police protection at night. Sources say some police personnel may be charged in his death. A youth named Akash was shot dead in Mehgaon village by rioters.
 
 In Gwalior, rocked by three deaths, there were chilling scenes of people shooting at each other with revolvers.
