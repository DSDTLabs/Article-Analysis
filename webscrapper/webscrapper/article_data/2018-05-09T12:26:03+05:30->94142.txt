VADODARA: The   high court has issued a notice to the   ( ) on a petition filed by its members Rajendrasingh   and Dr Mahendra Dhopte requesting that committee of administrators be appointed in the body.

 “The HC has issued notices to the BCA and its office-bearers and asked them to respond on June 21,” Rathod said. 
 
 He had also approached the charity commissioner and made a similar demand. BCA officials, however, said that they haven’t got any notice yet. “Once we get the notice, we will decide on further course of action,” a BCA official said.
 
 In his petition, Rathod has alleged administrative failures of the current management. “The current managing committee is functioning illegally as its tenure completed in 2015. They don’t have any right to run the association now. So, I demanded appointment an administrator who will govern BCA,” Rathod said.
 
 Rathod has said claimed in the petition that BCA is acting in complete contravention of Lodha Committee’s recommendations. The petition says that the illegal functioning of the current managing committee members and the absence of elections leads to the risk of losing membership and support of the BCCI.
 
 “There is no president of the association, no vice-presidents and both the secretaries are just appointees. I have also demanded that election for various BCA posts be held as early as possible,” Rathod said. He added that due to misconduct of the current managing committee BCA is deprived of the grant of funds and subsidies from the BCCI. Rathod also said that the losses to the BCA should be recovered from the current management.
