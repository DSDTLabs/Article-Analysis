SHIMLA: Chief minister   on Friday moved the Himachal Pradesh high court challenging the   Appellate   (ITAT), Chandigarh, order of December 8, 2016, which rejected his plea against the reassessment of his income tax returns ( ).

 While taking up the matter for hearing, the court had issued notice to the income tax authorities and directed them to file a reply before the next hearing.
 
 HC has also restrained the income tax department from passing any final order against the chief minister. The matter has been posted to March 9 for further hearing. The CM has challenged the orders stating that he was aggrieved by the Tribunal's order.
 
 On December 8, Chandigarh bench of ITAT headed by judicial member I C Sudhir, along with accountant member R S Syal, had dismissed the appeal filed by Virbhadra observing that additional commissioner of income tax was justified in setting aside the assessment order and directing the assessee officer to frame a fresh assessment.
 
 Later, reacting in Shimla in December 2016, Virbhadra had said ITAT is a “kangaroo court“ and accused Union minister   of manipulating the system.
 
 He had claimed that two benches of ITAT at Chandigarh had four judges, who were earlier conducting the hearing on his appeal, but for final decision on it judgesd were sent from Delhi.
