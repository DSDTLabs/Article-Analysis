HYDERABAD: Strongly opposing enhancing retirement age of professors, the   Government Doctors' Association (TGGDA) on Monday demanded that the state first implement Career Advance Scheme (CAS), failing which they threatened to launch a protest. 

 They said doctors often retire without getting promoted and said enhancing retirement age to 63 or 65 would do more harm than good. 
 
 "I joined service in 1999 and am still working as an assistant professor. People who joined along with me in other states are now heading the department and are earning more than what I am getting. At this stage, if government increases retirement age, than we have to retire at the same designation," said Bhumesh Kumar K, general secretary of TGGDA, Gandhi Medical College Unit.
 
 He said if the government failed to react in two weeks, they would launch a protest, starting with a black badge protest. "The protests will be in a phased manner. First, we will start by wearing black badges. This will be followed by boycotting elective duties and eventually all services," he said.
 
 At Annual General Body Meeting on Monday, the doctors passed resolutions on these two points and said Telangana is the only state in which CAS hasn't been implemented.
 
 "If CAS is implemented, we will be automatically promoted to designation of associate professors if we have experience of four years and have published two papers. A candidate will become a professor if he or she has about seven years experience and has about four papers published against his name," said D Ramesh, president of the association.
