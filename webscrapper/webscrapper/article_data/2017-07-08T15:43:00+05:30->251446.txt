Nagpur: Around June 13, the Nagpur LGBT Pride Group, along with supporters, began collecting letters asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rethink the laws laid down by section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Nearly a month after it began, the initiative has received a whopping 236 letters so far. “I will post the letters in a few days,” says Anand Chandrani, who is leading the initiative. “It was in my mind since quite some time. Our PM is not touching this issue. Is he under pressure or is he not aware? I’ve seen the PMO responding to all letters. I just want a reply from them, whatever it is,” Chandrani adds. Several members of LGBT have also penned down their feelings and requests for the government. The letters will be sent through post offices in the city. Many supporters have signed a pre-drafted letter to show their participation. Section 377, which criminalizes sexual activities “against the law of nature”, is not limited to just LGBT people, argues Chandrani. It is for anyone, who doesn’t procreate while having sex. “And what about contraceptives then?” he asks. This initiative should be taken by all the cities in India in order to make PM consider the issue, Chandrani adds.
