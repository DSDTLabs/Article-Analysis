Chandigarh: Despite bright sunshine during the day, the chill refuses to relax its grip over the city, courtesy the winds blowing from the north.

 “For last one week, air movement has been stable and since there was no rainfall, the situation led to formation of fog. The winds will, however, add to the cold, as they are coming from snow-laden mountains in the north. The temperatures will increase during the week,” said Surender Paul, director, Chandigarh meteorological department.
 
 On Monday, the maximum temperature witnessed shot up to 20.2 degrees celsius from 19.4 degrees celsius. The minimum temperature, however, dropped to 4.7 degrees celsius from 5.8 degrees celsius on Sunday following a clear night sky.

 For Tuesday, weathermen have forecast mainly clear sky with mist and haze. The maximum temperature is expected to be recorded at 21 degrees celsius, while the minimum will be 5 degrees celsius.
 
 While Punjab and Haryana continues to be enveloped with moderate to dense fog during most part of the day, the intensity of fog has decreased in Chandigarh since Saturday. This has led to rise in day temperatures and a drop in minimum temperatures.
