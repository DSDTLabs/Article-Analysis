Mumbai: A special   (PCOSOA) court on Wednesday convicted a 25-year-old Vakola man for sexually assaulting a nine-year-old   in 2014. The accused will be sentenced following arguments on quantum of sentence later this week.

 The boy told the court that on September 22, 2014, when he went to the public toilet, the accused followed him, closed the door from inside and sexually assaulted him. The traumatized child rushed home and informed his father about his ordeal, but by then the accused had vanished. 
 
 Six days later, when the boy was playing outside his house, he saw the accused and informed his father, who caught him. The Vakola police arrested the youth and booked him under   sections 342 (wrongful confinement) and 377 (unnatural sexual offences) as well as under section 4 (penetrative  ) of PCOSOA, which attracts a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
 
 Last year, the convict filed a bail plea, but it was rejected on July 8, 2016. “Considering the nature of the crime and the age of the victim, the accused is not found entitled to bail,” the court had said. On August 18, 2016, the court framed charges against the accused, who pleaded not guilty. 
 
 Public prosecutor Jyoti Sawant said among the witnesses was the boy who deposed and identified the accused in court.
