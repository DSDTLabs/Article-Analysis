SURAT: The political atmosphere in the Union territory of Dadra and   (DNH) is surcharged ahead of the scheduled visit of Prime Minister   in the second week of April. 

 Political pundits expect big development, with Gujarat likely to go for early polls due to the astounding victory of the BJP in the Uttar Pradesh.
 
 Sources said PM Modi is scheduled to visit DNH on April 14 for launching around four to five public utility projects by the administration. 
 
 A public meeting is planned on the ground at Sayli road in Silvassa, where the BJP leaders from both the Union territories of Daman and DNH will be present. 
 
 It is also believed that PM Modi may set the ball rolling for the merger of the union territories of DNH and Daman into Gujarat, which the former Minister of State for Home,   had hinted during his visit to Daman in 2015. 
 
 Chaudhary had stated that the central government is all prepared to merge the union territory of Daman, Diu and DNH in Gujarat, but has stepped back due to the opposition from the residents.
 
 On the other hand, political assumptions are ripe that the Congress stalwart from DNH, Mohan Delkar may join the BJP in the presence of PM Modi on April 14. Though, few days ago, Delkar issued a statement denouncing any plan to join the BJP. 
 
 A six-time Member of Parliament from DNH starting from 1989, Delkar has fought the   election as the voice of Adivasi people in the union territory. While he fought Lok Sabha election as independent candidate twice and won, he contested on the Congress ticket twice and was also the BJP candidate in 1998. 
 
 In the heated Lok Sabha election in 2014, Delkar, who contested on the Congress ticket, lost to BJPâ€™s   on a wafer thin margin. 
 
 Sources close to Delkar have refuted the claims of him joining the BJP.
