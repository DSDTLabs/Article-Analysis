KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan will hope to return to winning ways when they face the challenge of   in their seventh-round I-League encounter at the Mohun Bagan club ground on Tuesday evening.

 Having drawn their last three home matches -- against Shillong Lajong FC, Neroca FC and Indian Arrows -- the green and maroons are under pressure as they stand fourth in the table with 10 points after six matches.
 
 They will, thus, be quite desperate to pick up full points against   FC in order not to fall too behind in the title race.
 
 Mohun Bagan will continue to miss the services of Haitian playmaker and captain   and right-back Arijit Bagui owing to injuries. That means Mohun Bagan will have three foreign players at their disposal: defender Eze Kingsley, attacking midfielder   and striker Aser Pierrick Dipanda Dicka.
 
 "We have to get back to scoring goals. The path would not always be smooth but you need to find a way out. We have ourselves created this pressure and we only need to come out of it," said Mohun Bagan coach   at the pre-match press conference on Monday. "I felt in the last match against Indian Arrows, we took a lot of pressure after conceding the equaliser. The boys should not take much pressure."
 
 There might be two changes to Mohun Bagan's starting XI from the game against Indian Arrows. Central defender   might come in place of   while Surchandra Singh may replace   in central midfield.
 
 On the other hand, Chennai City FC are in the eighth spot on the table with four points from six encounters. They lost their last match 1-2 at home against East Bengal.
 
 "It is a great challenge to play Mohun Bagan at their home ground. We have been playing well but not getting the desired result," said Chennai City FC coach V Soundararajan.
