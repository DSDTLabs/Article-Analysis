Mumbai:   reported a net profit of Rs 2,049 crore for the quarter ended June 2017 down 8.2% from Rs 2,232 crore in the corresponding quarter last year as income failed to keep pace with operating expenses.

 On a consolidated basis the bank reported a 3% increase in net profit to Rs 2,605 crore.
 
 Announcing the results, ICICI Bank MD & CEO   attributed the dip in profits to   of Rs 206 crore on profits from overseas subsidiaries, which are no longer allowed to be taken as income by the RBI. Last year’s earnings included a Rs 204 crore quarterly dividend from its life insurance arm that now pays out dividends on a half-yearly basis.
 
 Kochhar also said that the company would be selling shares of its non-life subsidiary in an   this year for which a draft prospectus has been filed with the regulator.
 
 “ICICI Banks’ Q1FY18 results remained a mixed bag, while the reported bottom line was broadly on expected line. The overall loan growth remained muted due to downsizing of the overseas book,” said Siddharth Purohit, banking analyst with Angel Broking.
 
 The bank’s loan book grew 3.3% to Rs 4.64 lakh crore which was much slower than the 14.7% growth in deposits. Deposits on end-June 2017 stood at Rs 4.86 lakh crore as against 4.24 lakh crore a year ago.
 
 Kochhar said that that the gross   (NPAs) in the bank had been the lowest in seven quarters. She added that net NPAs —   adjusted for provisions — declined during the quarter. The bank reported a sharp improvement in recovery of bad loans following the sale of JP Cements, a defaulting company, to UltraTech Cement which took on the debt. The deal took place toward the end of the quarter.
 
 “As far as NPAs are concerned, actually the trend is very positive,” Kochhar told reporters on a conference call, adding the bank had been selective in lending to corporates and was growing its retail loans faster.
