Coimbatore: Summer season wildlife census would be conducted at Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) from May 21-28. The forest department has invited volunteers with prior experience to join the census, which would cover carnivores such as tigers and leopards. Forest officials said on the first day, both the volunteers and the field staff would be given training. And in the next three days, they would be taught carnivore science. “Then, the staff and the volunteers will conduct population estimation using line transect method for three days. On the last day, the data will be compiled,” an official said. This year, the department would provide the field staff with mobile phones having the MSTrIPES application to conduct the census. “Though we used the mobile app for the last census, we had asked the volunteers to install it themselves on their mobile phones. But this year, mobile phones installed with the app and tested on the field will be given to the field staff,” the official said. The official said they would take only those volunteers, who have prior experience in wildlife census. “Forest officials will accompany them for their safety,” the official added.
