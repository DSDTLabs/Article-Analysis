"To be fair, I do have an annoying gene. I annoy myself sometimes," Bono told.

 He added, "You know I've been writing about my own hypocrisy for 20 years. But the hypocrisy of the human heart is so much more interesting than a rock 'n' roll band trying to take its   seriously.
 
 "I mean, come on, would people prefer I die broke? They try to say, 'You're not idealists really' to a band who have shared everything, committed our lives to each other and various campaigns of social justice. It won't wash."
 
 Bono says he thinks that a lot of people might just not like him and his band, and that he tries to find reasons to explain it.
