Ahmedabad: In September last year, two students of crafting creative communication (CCC) programme of MICA had drowned at Candolim beach in Goa, while on a study tour. As a tribute to her batchmates and friends, Stuti Sudha, another student of the programme, penned a Dastangoi — an Urdu storytelling form — on safety at Goa beaches and later shot the narrative in the form of a film, as part of her elective project.

 
 “What happened was extremely shocking. I kept thinking about it and felt as if the sea took them away,” said Stuti. “As part of our elective on Dastangoi, we were asked to write one on a social cause. My story revolved around the conversation between the sea and a child. The sea giving out a warning, asking people to learn about it and remember its power before they come frolicking into the waves.”
 
 The tragedy occurred on a full moon during high tide, Stuti said. “We ventured into the sea that night,” she said. “However, nobody told us that it was a full moon night — there were no warnings. That became the inspiration of my project.” 
 
 A few other students of the CCC programme also worked on projects revolving around safety on beaches of Goa through different mediums such as interactive signages and installations in the sea.
 
 “Lives are lost casually on beaches,” said Pravin Mishra, chairperson, CCC programme. “When a warning reaches you at the right time, it could make a difference. That’s exactly what these students have tried to communicate. We will take this forward through some channel in Goa.”
