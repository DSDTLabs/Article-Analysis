Ahmedabad: While the common perception about police inspectors is that they get their own vehicle, the state police department found it necessary to add a clause to the requirements for promotion of  , that they should have a valid driving license.

 A notification dated February 23 by  ,   ( ) states that the list for promotion of sub-inspectors to inspectors is being prepared. In a notification issued in October 2008, it mentioned that the candidate should have a valid light motor vehicle (LMV) and heavy motor vehicle (HMV) licence. The notification asked police departments to submit the relevant documents and also inform them about cases where licences have got lapsed.
 
 Sources said that the development is being seen from both points of view. “According to the new norms, promotions are due after a minimum of seven years of service. This makes the batch of 2009 eligible. The number of applicants is very high and it is possible that the circular may work as an initial screening process beside other parameters,” said an official.
 
 On the other hand, there was also criticism. “An officer of the rank of police inspector is generally allotted an official vehicle which makes the rule redundant,” said another official, adding that the requirement may be for personal safety norms.
