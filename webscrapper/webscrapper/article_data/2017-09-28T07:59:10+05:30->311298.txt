BENGALURU: “The  ,“ said Afsar, the   in  , who lost   to the flooding. And it's not the first time this has happened. Since August 15 when the big storm lashed the city, the owner of the shop managed by Afsar has incurred damages worth Rs 30 lakh.

 “Nobody will buy damaged products, and the distributor won't take it back, so we have to throw it all out. Our computer was also damaged. No engineer or official has come here to fix the problem, and our shops and houses keep getting flooded,“ Afsar said.
 
 Tuesday night's rain left the streets of Koramangala 4th Block inundated and clogged with silt and sludge, with residents saying the water level on the road had risen to 2.5 ft in the early hours of Wednesday .
 
 “We've lost count of the number of times our house has been flooded since Independence day . Since then, we have lost our computer, printer, cot and a number of other things“ said Jane William, a resident.
 
 Right outside her house, pourakarmikas, wearing no shoes, gloves or safety equipment, were sweeping the sludgy water back into the drains.“The water is being pushed back into the drains, so the next time it rains, it comes gushing out again. Instead of desilting the drains in the summer months before the monsoon, the authorities are desilting them now,“ said Sapna Tony, her daughter-in-law.
 
 Revathi Rangachari, another resident, was sorting through her collection of classical music, many of which had been ruined by water that rushed into her house. She said: “Some of these are more than 70 years old, and now they are ruined. This is the sixth or seventh time that water has entered our house, and this has to stop. Civic agencies send labourers to do some work, but it is never supervised. We have to keep calling them and making complaints, but they never call us for our feedback. We moved here four years ago, and now we're thinking of moving out because nobody can live like this.“
