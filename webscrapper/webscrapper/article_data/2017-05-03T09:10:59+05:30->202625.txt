NAGPUR: Unidentified persons have damaged former   corporator Bandu Talvekar’s car parked in front of his residence at Tegh bahadur nagar on   in the early hours of April 30. Talvekar, who has reported the matter before Jaripatka police, said that his vehicle was targeted by   activists at the behest of a senior leader. 

 Sounding unhappy with the action, Talvekar said the Jaripatka police have merely registered a case of non-cognizable offence following his complaint. Talvekar said that on April 29 he had a heated argument with a senior BJP leader as he had been continuing to retain the sticker of ‘corporator’ on his vehicle. In the last civic election, Talvekar had lost to a BJP candidate. When asked to remove the sticker of corporator, Talvekar is learnt to have argued that the civic election earlier this year was not the last which had led to an argument.
 
 Talvekar said the police took his complaint lightly. “The cops did not even try to recover the   footage of an ATM centre which may have caught the accused damaging my car. It seems the cops are under pressure of the ruling BJP,” he said. 
 
 Jaripatka police said the probe is now underway.
