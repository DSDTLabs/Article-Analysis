MUMBAI: An app-based   aggregator service will be launched in Mumbai on Thursday. A source informed TOI that the service, perhaps the first of its kind in the city, is aimed at providing citizens access to more than 125 ambulances in Mumbai region and help them reach out to the nearest ambulance 24X7. There will also be an alternate   to book ambulances in the userâ€™s vicinity.

 Sources said that though the city has a list of ambulance services (mostly provided by NGOs, hospitals and also political parties) that can be booked through a phone call, the app will give a choice of ambulances in the vicinity. The service charge is being worked out and will be disclosed on Thursday, the source said.
 
 Users will have to log onto the app to look for ambulances in the vicinity. The moment you make a request, the nearest ambulance will rush to your location, a source said. Such requests can be made from anywhere. To begin with, the app service will be available in the western suburbs, south Mumbai and Thane, the source said, adding that by June-end, it may be available in all areas. The aggregator  , Dial4242, has been imparting training to ambulance drivers for the past three months on how to use smartphones to accept bookings and respond to requests. The aggregator also plans to provide digital payment facility.
