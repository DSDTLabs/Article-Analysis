THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sensing the danger posed by a silent campaign - initiated by certain individuals in support of paedophilia in   - chief minister   on Wednesday warned of   and their supporters. 

 In a strongly worded Facebook post, Vijayan said that the government has taken note of incidents in which even small girls were being subject to assault. "Police will act sternly in such cases. Whoever may be the suspects, they will be brought before law," he said.
 
 Terming those who support paedophilia as 'number one antisocial elements', Vijayan said not only those who attack children but those who support their act, commit a serious offence. He added that the government has already issued a directive to district police chiefs to compile a list of sexual offenders over the past 10 years for preparing a sexual offenders' registry.
 
 Recently, a Facebook post by Muhammed Farhan that described his lust for a five-year-old girl had created a storm in social media with a majority condemning his fetish and a minority supporting him. Farhan deactivated his FB account after two complaints were filed against the post.
 
 The hi-tech  , which conducted a preliminary probe into the matter on Wednesday, recommended that the youth should be booked under sections of Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act as well as Information Technology Act. The cell also recommended a case against those who posted views supporting Farhan.
 
 The discussion taken forward in FB and WhatsApp group by a section of individuals tried to portray paedophilia as a different sexual orientation and sought support and care for them. Within hours of Pinarayi Vijayan's post, several FB users who took a lenient view of Farhan's post posted clarifications saying that they had never endorsed paedophilia and would never do so. A couple of Farhan's friends also posted on FB that he had been a paedophile for long and there were past instances of him torturing minor girls.
