BENGALURU: Buoyed by the overwhelming response to its recent job fair for senior citizens, the   Vocational Training and Skill Development Corporation Ltd ( ) has now planned to conduct a course to prepare youths for the defence forces. 

  The 10-week, 11-hour per day rigorous course for those aged 17-21 will be held at the Sainik schools in   and Belagavi. It will help them prepare to join the army as a jawan or to appear for the  's qualifying exams. 
 
  KVTSDC chairman Muralidhar Halappa said Karnataka is one of the first states to have such a training course; Rajasthan and   are still considering it. 
 
 The job fair for non-pensioners in the 60-70 age group had 9,600 persons registering and 3,726 were offered   on the spot by 60 recruiters. Further, 14 senior farmers found placements as lawn-keepers in MNCs for a monthly salary of Rs 14,000.
 
 "Our core objective is to empower women and youth aged 15 to 40. All political parties address such issues, but none pays attention to senior citizens," Halappa explained.
 
  KVTSDC's next job fair in May will be for women drivers (18-35 years), who ferry children to schools. 
 
 "With increasing incidents of sexual abuse of children in schools, parents will feel secure sending their wards in a vehicle driven by a woman,'' Halappa said.
