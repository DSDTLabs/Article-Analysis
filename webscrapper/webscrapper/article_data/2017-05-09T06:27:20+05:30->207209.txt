NEW DELHI: Despite India's publicly articulated reservations, China has offered to mediate between India and Pakistan to resolve their differences.Chinese ambassador to India Luo  , who made the remark, said the development of China, Pakistan and India called for stability in the region and a friendly environment.

 “Otherwise, how can we open up and develop? That's why we say we are willing to mediate when India and Pakistan have problems,“ the ambassador said. He added though that the “precondition“ was that both India and Pakistan should accept it.
 
 Senior government officials brushed aside the remarks, saying India's position was well known on its disputes with Pakistan. Luo said China's willingness to help India and Pakistan solve their problems was based on goodwill.
 
 Addressing a gathering at the United Service Institution of India, the envoy also said it was wrong to say that China always put Pakistan first when handling its relations with south Asian countries. “Simply put, we always put China first and we deal with problems based on their own merits. Take the Kashmir issue for example, we supported the relevant UN resolutions before the 1990s. Then we supported a settlement through bilateral negotiation in line with the Shimla Agreement.This is an example of China taking care of India's concern,“ he said.
 
 On the   issue, Luo said China did not oppose any country's membership and it believed a standard for admission should be agreed upon first.“On promoting India-Pakistan reconciliation, we hope that both sides could live together in peace, because this is conducive to regional stability in the interests of China,“ he said.
