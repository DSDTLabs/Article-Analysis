PUNE: The recent arrest of the prime  ,   (25), in the wine shop manager’s assault and   case at Fatimanagar helped police detect seven cases — six vehicle thefts and a burglary.

 Assistant inspector of the Hadapsar police, Sandip Deshmane, said, “We recovered a motorcycle from Padule. During interrogation he confessed to have committed three   — a robbery at Fatimanagar, a vehicle theft and a burglary at Mundhwa. His custody has been transferred to the Mundhwa police.”
 
 The Hadapsar police had zeroed in on Padule near Shewalwadi market on December 27. Akshay is the second suspect arrested in the wine shop manager’s assault and robbery case. His brother, Ajay, was arrested earlier. Two others, a conspirator and a pillion rider, are on the run. The duo had snatched the cash bag of the manager near Empress Wines at Fatimanagar around 12.10am on October 13.
 
 Senior inspector of the Mundhwa police, Anil Pathrudkar, said, “Padule had stolen a gold chain and ring from a house at Keshavnagar in August and a bike from Mundhwa in October. We have recovered the ornaments and bike. The Wanowrie police later obtained his custody in the robbery case.”
 
 Wanowrie police’s sub-inspector Ajay Mhetre said, “We arrested Padule on the night of January 2. During interrogation, he confessed to have received Rs58,000 after committing the robbery. Of it, he spent Rs38,000. We have recovered Rs20,000 from him. Four vehicles — two stolen from Hadapsar and one each from Wanowrie and Sahakarnagar — were also recovered.”
 
 He said, “Padule had stolen the vehicles to commit crime when he was on the run in the robbery case. He is in magisterial custody at the Yerawada central prison. We have formed teams to arrest his two accomplices on the run,” Mhetre added.
