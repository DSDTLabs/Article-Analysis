SILIGURI: Heads met — Mamata Banerjee and   — at Uttarkanya on Friday, putting behind the “misunderstanding” between the two states — West Bengal and Sikkim — over a host of issues, including the two government’s opposing stands over the demand for Gorkhaland in the Hills, to carve out a hand-holding plan for development of Sikkim, Darjeeling and north Bengal.
 
 “From now, we will move together for the development of Sikkim, Darjeeling and Bengal. Whatever misunderstanding was there is past. We will move together,” the   said. Taking the cue, the Bengal CM stressted on the cooperation between Sikkim and Bengal in areas such as tourism, transport. “Siliguri is the crucial corridor for the Northeast. So is Sikkim. It is the gateway to the Northeast. The misunderstanding over Darjeeling is over now. Minor problems over transport will be sorted out at the administrative level. People in north Bengal share many things with those in Sikkim — eating habits, connectivity, culture. It is good that the meeting took place here in north Bengal,” Mamata said.
 
 
 It is coincidence that the meeting took place on a day when the Supreme Court turned down the anticipatory bail plea by Bimal Gurung accused under the UAPA and other criminal charges.
 
 At the end of the meeting,   invited his Bengal counterpart to Gangtok and Rongpo while Mamata invited him to Darjeeling and Kolkata. Political observers maintain that the BJP’s trying to foment pro-Gorkhaland forces under Bimal Gurung in Darjeeling and the threat that   has posed to Chamling’s Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) have brought the two heads of states closer.
 
 The opposition in Sikkim, and also the BJP, have been demanding the merger of Sikkim and Darjeeling to solve the “disquiet”.
 
 At a recent public meeting held at Yangyang in his native South District, Chamling too had voiced his concern over the “hidden agenda” of the opposition.
