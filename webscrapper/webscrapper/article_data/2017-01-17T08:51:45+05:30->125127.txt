PANAJI: A day after withdrawing its support for Govind Gaude, the independent candidate from Priol constituency,   (AAP) on Monday announced   as its candidate in Priol. This move was preceded by the fact that Gaude was extended support by the   (BJP) too, which he accepted.

 “By accepting the support of the BJP, Govind Gaude has betrayed us. We have withdrawn our support to him. Desai has accepted our request to contest from Priol,” party spokesperson and senior leader Oscar Rebelo said, adding that Gaude had, himself, requested AAP’s support.
 
 Dattaram Desai was AAP’s candidate for the North Goa Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 general assembly elections. Accusing the Congress of indulging in corrupt practices and using secularism as a shield, Rebello said that these “corrupt practices led to their ouster in 2014, which in turn brought in a communal BJP to power”.
 
 Responding to Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai’s accusation that AAP is contesting elections just to split Congress votes and is a decoy set up by BJP, Rebelo said that AAP is the only party that is standing up against the BJP at the state and central level.
