PATNA: Suspended BJP MP   on Wednesday termed senior party member   as a “failed finance minister”. 

 “He (Jaitley) does not know the ABC of finance and is an overrated advocate,” Azad said, adding people have gone through hardships for his decision to demonetise old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.
 
 When it was pointed out to him that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the driving force behind demonetisation, Azad said Jaitley’s failure as a finance minister and Reserve Bank of India’s poor strategies led to problems for common people. 
 
 The cricketer-turned-politician, who represents Darbhanga Lok Sabha seat, said the defamation suit filed by Jaitley against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was “frivolous”. “Enough evidences are there against Jaitley to prove his involvement in the embezzlement of Rs 400 crore of Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) when he was at the helm of affairs of the association,” Azad said. 
 
 “How could people expect Jaitley to run finance ministry when he cannot even handle the budget of DDCA properly?” Azad asked.
 
 “I personally informed Jaitley several times about embezzlement of funds when he was heading the association and also wrote hundreds of letters, but to no avail,” Azad said, adding the minister’s relatives and close friends were also involved in the scam. 
 
 Azad said Jaitley played a key role to ensure his suspension from BJP as he was constantly raising the DDCA issue.
