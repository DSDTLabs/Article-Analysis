AMRITSAR: Taking a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim of being a chowkidar (watchman),   (AAP) leader and   member Sanjay Singh said the chowkidar was now favouring the corrupt. Talking to the media in Amritsar on Saturday, Sanjay alleged, “Modi says he is a chowkidar, but now the chowikdar has connived with corrupt elements to become their partner.”

 Singh’s comment came in the wake of industrialists like Nirav Modi, Lalit   and Vijay Mallya who have fled the country ‘duping’ the nation of crores with the government failing to bring them back. 
 
 In reply to a question over the looming threat of 20 MLAs losing their assembly membership in Delhi, he cited examples of how cancellation of appointment of parliamentary secretaries in India has not led to quashing of their legislative posts. He said while the Delhi high court had cancelled the appointment of parliamentary secretaries yet the Election Commission of India recommended their disqualification from the assembly, adding they were waiting for the final verdict of the court. “Former election commissioner of India A K Jyoti has worked as the agent of PM Modi,” Sanjay alleged.
 
 He also expressed surprise over the Rs 5,000-crore defamation case slapped on him by the   group for his comments on the purchase of Rafale jets. “I stick to my words,” he said.
 
 Sanjay said the party was hopeful of a much better performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “People are fed up with the Union government as it has not fulfilled its promises,” he said while giving ‘zero’ to the performance of the Captain Amarinder Singh government in Punjab.
