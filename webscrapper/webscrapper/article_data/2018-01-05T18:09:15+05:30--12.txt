NEW DELHI:   has dragged India into its war of words with the US, now accusing New Delhi of "lies and deceit", much in the manner   accused   of the same, reported The Express Tribune.

 
 Pakistan's foreign minister   said the US is "trumpeting India's lies and deceit", that the two countries have a "nexus" and that the US "is speaking the language of Indians".
 
 "The United States and India have a nexus, they understand their interests are same in the region," said Asif, in an interview with Geo TV yesterday.
 
 These comments by Asif followed similar sentiments he expressed earlier in the day, at a meeting with the country's national security committee. At the meeting, Pakistani officials discussed responses to US President Donald Trump's New Year's Day tweet in which he accused Pakistan of "lies and deceit" and of playing America for "a fool".
 
  
  
 
 Following his tweet, the Trump administration announced it was blocking $255 million in military aid to Pakistan. And earlier today, the US also announced it was 
  - including the $255 million - to the country it accuses of providing safe haven to terrorists.
 
 In his interview with Geo TV yesterday. Asif was asked whether Pakistan will be able to survive without US assistance. The minister indicated 'yes'.
 
 "The world is vast enough and the US is not feeding us," he said.
 
 
 
 
 Asif believes the US owes $9 billion to Pakistan, in return for its services in the 'war on terror'.
 
 "They used our airspace for free, for the then rulers sold out this nation and its interests to strengthen their rule," he said referring to military dictator Pervez Musharraf, who headed Pakistan during and after 9/11, when the 'war on terror' began.
 
  "Our airbases were given to the US, our roads were devastated. If we monetise, the biggest usage was of our airspace, while they audit every penny they give us," said Asif.
