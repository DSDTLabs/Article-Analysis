LUCKNOW: With less than a fortnight left for   to retire, the race for the post of chief of   has entered the last lap. Till now, 1984 batch IPS Rajni Kant Mishra was the frontrunner for the   DGP's post, but he was appointed director general of Sashastra Seema Bal on Monday.

 Speculations are rife that Sulkhan Singh will get a three-month extension. Of late, chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi has been openly appreciating the way the police force has been functioning on public forums. It is learned that Singh handpicked the team deputed at DGP headquarters as well as in prime districts.
 
 The state government is yet to approach Delhi to seek a nod for the UP DGP's extension, but a saint-cum-politi cian with strong connections with top   leaders and a retired IPS officer, who has been striving hard for reforms in the police department, have been lobbying for him.
 
 IPS officers Praveen Singh, director general of fire services, and Gopal Gupta, director general of training, are also in the fray. Praveen Singh is the seniormost IPS officer in UP after Sulkhan.
