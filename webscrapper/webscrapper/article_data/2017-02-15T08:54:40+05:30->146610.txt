AMARAVATI: Expressing displeasure at the functioning of ministers, chief minister N   has directed them to make   more vigorously to strengthen the party base. He said that several ministers are packing their district tours with official programmes without even making a trip to the local party office. The state cabinet has discussed the political situation in the state after the officials left the conference hall soon after completing the administrative business at the secretariat. 

 The CM reviewed the party's prospects in the coming   with the cabinet colleagues. 
 
 "Don't take the   lightly. I want all of you to work overtime to ensure that the party makes a clean sweep," he made it clear and said the ministers were left without any option but to run with him.
