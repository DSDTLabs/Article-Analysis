GURUGRAM:   on January 12 revised its   and sewerage charges downwards across Haryana. Last year, they had drawn fire from Gurugram residents after they hiked charges. This revision being state-wide, the Gurugram administration didn’t have any role in it, but the latest notification has definitely led to lower rates than before.

 Huda had effected the earlier revision in April last year, when it declared that starting June 1, 2017, residents would have to pay Rs 10 per kilolitre for consuming water above 20 kilolitre a month, effectively a tariff   of around 150% for residential water supply above 20 kilolitre per month.
 
 For residential plotted areas, there are now three slabs. For consumption of up to 20 kilolitre, residents are charged Rs 2.5 per kilolitre for the first 10 kilolitres, and Rs 5 per kilolitre for the remaining 10 kilolitres. For consumption above 20 kilolitres and up to 30 kilolitres, there is a flat rate of Rs 8 per kilolitre, while for consumption above 30 kilolitres, there is a flat rate of Rs 10 per kilolitre.
 
 “For unmetered areas, the charges have now been fixed at Rs 50 for plot size of up to 50 sq m; Rs 100 for plot size above 50 sq m and up to 100 sq m. Previously, the rate was Rs 200 for a plot size up to 100 sq m,” explained a Huda official.
 
 Officials also told TOI that sewerage charges have also been slashed to just 20% of water bills, from the 25% earlier. The revision of rates in April 2017 was the first such move in 16 years. But apparently, due to the backlash from residents, they were revised downwards to ease the burden on the public. The new rates became applicable from January 1, 2018. Residents get a bi-monthly bill, with charges adjusted in the next bill.
