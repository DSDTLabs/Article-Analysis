The   is all set to back the city’s Govinda-Ganesha outfits on the   issue, triggering yet another round of confrontation with the Devendra Fadnavis regime in the run up to the festival season.

 Pointing out that the city’s festival   are slated to meet chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday to discuss issues pertaining to security, law and order and noise pollution during the upcoming festival, Thackeray said, “The Sena will go ahead with its plan if talks with the chief minister yield no positive result.”
 
 “On the eve of festivals, the government raises issues such as terrorism and environment. Red alert is promulgated right in the middle of festivities. As a result, the Hindu community celebrates festivals under duress. The government should come up with a final solution to these problems,” he added. Thackeray was talkingto mediapersons after inaugurating the Sena’s Nariman Point headquarters on Wednesday.
