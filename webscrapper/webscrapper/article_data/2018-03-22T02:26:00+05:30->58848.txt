Vijayawada: Not withstanding High Court (HC) judgement saying, collecting parking fees in commercial establishments is illegal, multiplexes and shopping malls are still collecting parking fees from the people in Vijayawada. 

 The High Court in CH Madan Mohan Vs Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad categorically said, “Parking fee is an illegal amount collected from the consumers and violates two state laws.”
 
 Though the orders were given about 15 years ago, this is not being implemented anywhere in the city. Habib Sultan Ali, chief patron of AASRAA an NGO working on consumer rights, said, “The administration has completely failed to implement the High Court orders and also to protect the interests of consumers. Malls are charging Rs 20 for two-wheelers and Rs 40 for four-wheelers for every two hours in Vijayawada. This is a gross violation of consumer rights and also the state laws.” 
 
 ‘I just went to the mall to buy something and returned in five minutes as it was not available. The parking guys insisted to pay Rs 40 saying that once the vehicle enters the parking lot it is the minimum fee everyone has to pay,” Machineni Krishna a resident of Poranki said. Meanwhile, the VMC is planning to bring a new rule on the lines of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) which says that consumers need not pay   if they show a bill of any amount or a movie ticket.
