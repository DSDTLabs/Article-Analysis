GAYA: In continuation of the ongoing exercise to ensure peaceful and fair municipal election,   DM   has served externment notice to Vicky Sharma, husband of Gaya mayor Soni Kumari. Voting is scheduled for May 21.

 Police sources said Sharma is an absconder. Earlier, arrest warrant was issued against him in connection with the April 11 violence in Tekari between the villagers and sand mafia. Tekari police station was vandalized, vehicles parked inside were torched and an ASI had suffered injuries.
 
 The omission of Sharma’s name from the first list of 37 potential miscreants raised a hue and cry allegedly due to his proximity with the police. The list was prepared by the SHOs of the respective police stations falling in the municipal corporation area.
 
 The failure to arrest Sharma even five weeks after the Tekari incident had caused embarrassment to senior police officers. 
 
 In a related development, deputy mayor Mohan Srivastav appeared in the DM’s court. Mohan claim he was a law-abiding citizen and it would be unfair to extern him from the district as it would also affect his democratic rights because he is a candidate from ward number 11. 
 
 He is also learnt to have submitted some documents in support of his claim of innocence. The DM heard his arguments and reserved his order.
