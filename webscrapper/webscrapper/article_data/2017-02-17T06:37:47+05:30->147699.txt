PANAJI: Goa State Pollution Control Board ( ) has rescheduled the environmental public hearings for three projects proposed by   and will hold the same in the second half of March. The move comes after South Goa collector Swapnil Naik deferred the public hearings, following a petition filed by advocate Savio Correia.

 The three projects proposed by MPT include enhancement of two berths, capital dredging for capesize vessels and redevelopment of berth 8 and 9.
 
 GSPCB has invited local residents and concerned citizens to send their objections or suggestions. The   for the terminal capacity enhancement at berth 5A and 6A by South West Port will be held on March 20, instead of February 17, at Vasco Residency hall. GSPCB had earlier convened the public hearing at the MPT officers' club in Sada.
 
 The hearings for deepening of the approach channel and inner basin for capesize vessels, and work on re-development of berths 8, 9, and barge berths at the port, have been rescheduled for March 24 and March 27, respectively.
 
 All three public hearings will be held at 10.30am. 
 
 Hit by the slump in iron ore exports due to ban on mining, MPT has undertaken a cargo diversification programme and has initiated capital dredging through a project worth Rs 193 crore. 
 
 The Old Cross Fishing Canoe Owners Coop Society has challenged the project, stating it would be disastrous for the environment and affect marine resources.
 
 Union ministry of environment and forests, in a communication dated September 23, 2015, had exempted MPT from holding a public hearing, but this was quashed and set aside by the   (NGT), in an order dated September 2, 2016.
 
 NGT had ruled that the Union ministryâ€™s order was in violation of the provisions of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. Correia had argued that the dates were inconvenient and would lead to minimal public participation.
