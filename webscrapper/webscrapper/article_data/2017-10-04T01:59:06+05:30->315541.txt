NEW DELHI: The sight of a   on Sunday, with partly  , puja adornments and rotting flowers only made the comparison with puja associations that stuck to eco-friendly puja rituals all the more stark. The Central Pollution Control Board, along with the Bengal Association, will award 14 puja committees for using soluble clay, herbal dyes and even tanks dug on the puja grounds to submerge the idols, all to ensure the environment did not suffer from the adverse after-effects of the annual extravaganza.

 “The idea is to encourage more puja organisers to celebrate these festivals in an eco-friendly manner,” explained Dipankar Saha, scientist who is in charge of the air lab at CPCB. “Using   guidelines, the Bengal Association judged the pujas on various parameters, and the central pollution board will give them awards.”
 
 The parameters on which the organisers were judged included the use of eco-friendly clay for idols, herbal dyes, environment-friendly decoration of paper and biodegradable items, energy-efficient lighting at the pandals and waste management at source.
 
 “We have been awarding eco-friendly associations for the last five years, but this is the first time that CPCB has teamed with us to monitor and assess the pujas on its benchmarks,” said Tapan Sengupta, general secretary, Bengal Association. “Last year, we had 42 eco-friendly associations registered with us, but the number was over 60 this year. The goal is to encourage more associations to switch to this way of celebration.”
 
 The first prize will be   jointly to the Cooperative Puja Samiti in Chittaranjan Park and the Gurugram Bengali Puja Samiti, the second to Paschim Vihar Bengal Puja Samiti and Saptarshi Sangha Durga Puja in Noida, Sector 50, while the third prize will go to Navapalli Puja Samiti in Chittaranjan Park and Milani Cultural and Welfare Association in Mayur Vihar.
