KENDRAPADA: The turtles arrived in large numbers and lay eggs at the mouth of the Rushikulya river, presenting the annual spectacle which is at once a wildlife photographer's delight and nothing short of a natural miracle. 

 Yet this year, the turtles have largely been avoiding the   marine sanctuary in  , sparking concern among experts and speculation among wildlife lovers.
 
 While 3.5 lakh turtles laid eggs this time, they have inexplicably skipped the   beach - famous for being the world's largest rookery of sea turtles. More than 52,000 female Olive Ridley turtles had laid eggs at the same beach last year. "Certain adverse situations like constant erosion of the beach, illegal fishing and bright lights at the Wheeler island missile test range may have delayed the turtles' arrival here," said environment activist, Biswajit Mohanty. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the   on the protection of turtles had, in 2004, directed the state government to protect the endangered sea turtles from the onslaught of fishing trawlers operating illegally along the Odisha coast. CEC also directed the authorities to deploy two speedy boats at Gahiramatha for patrolling during turtle congregation and nesting period. Last year, forest officials had purchased two high speed interceptor boats at the cost of Rs 6 crore. But due to non-appointment of drivers and other trained crew members, both the boats have been gathering dust in Gahiramatha.
 
 Subrat Patra, the forest range officer of the Gahiramatha marine sanctuary, said both the interceptor boats are going to be used soon.
