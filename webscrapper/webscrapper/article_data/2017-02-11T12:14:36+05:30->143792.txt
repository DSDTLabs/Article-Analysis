BALLIA: The girls of the native village of Nirbhaya, whose gangrape and killing in December 2012 had sent shock waves across the world, still travel around 10 km to go to the nearest high school. 

 This, when chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had promised one way back in 2013 when he had visited the village shortly after Nirbhaya's death. 
 
 "Let's see when the inter college is built in the village. As of now, it is only on papers," an elderly Dev Muni said. The natives of the village are sceptical of the promises made by politicians. 
 
 The CM had promised a hospital, an inter college in the village and job to four youths of the family, said Lalji Singh, Nirbhaya's grandfather. Except construction of a primary health centre, most of the promises are a distant dream, he said, adding that though the PHC has been built, it fails to serve the purpose for want of doctors and remains locked most of the time. 
 
 A new PHC has come up at the entrance of the village. It was found locked around 1pm when the TOI team visited. According to villagers, there are two staff who provide medical help and medicines for minor ailments. Some people who had gone to the hospital for medical aid, returned empty handed after seeing the main gate locked. "Most of times we have to return disappointed," elderly woman Naina Devi said. "What is the use of a hospital that fails to provide medical help," another villager   asked.
 
 The land for the college has been identified and a proposal for the construction has been sent to the government for approval, district inspector of schools (DIOS) of Ballia   Singh said.
