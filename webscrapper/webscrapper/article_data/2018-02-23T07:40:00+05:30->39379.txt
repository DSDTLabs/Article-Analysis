Chandigarh: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday conveyed his concern to NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar for the commission having relied on outdated sampling data in its recent report titled ‘Healthy States, Progressive India’. The report makes it appear that the state’s performance in health sector was declining, he said.

 During the meeting between the two here on Thursday, Khattar clarified that the data for 2016-17 was readily available at the time of the NITI Aayog report and had it been taken into consideration, significant improvements registered by Haryana on all indices compared with 2015 would have easily been recognized.
 
 In a note that the CM handed over to Kumar, it has been clarified that neonatal mortality rate (NMR) has actually shown a two point decline from 24 in 2015, to 22 in 2016, whereas the report cites the previous increase from 23 in 2014, to 24 in 2015. Similarly, the under-five mortality rate (UFMR) has declined from 42 in 2015, to 37 in 2016, whereas the report cites the previous increase from 40 in 2014 to 42 in 2015.
 
 The full immunization coverage which the report shows increased from 82.54% in 2014 to 83.47% in 2015 and it has further improved to 89.13% in 2016.
 
 According to the report, sex ratio at birth (SRB) as per the sample registration system (SRS) has declined from 866 per 1,000 to 831 from base year 2012-14 to reference year 2013-15. This is based on SRS in which 251 sampling units in rural and urban areas covering only 2,35,000 population of the state and providing information for the state only not district-wise, it was pointed out to Kumar.
