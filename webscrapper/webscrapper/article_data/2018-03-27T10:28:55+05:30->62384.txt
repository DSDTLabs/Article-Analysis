JAIPUR: With the state already facing Supreme Court’s ire for  , the latest   too has pulled up the state government granting mining leases in   in violation of the apex court orders.

 The   in 2005 restrained any kind of mining in forest areas and in   hills where permission was granted after December 2002. However, many violations of the above order have been pointed out by   in its report.
 
 According to report, not only mining leases were renewed but fresh mining leases were issued in the Aravalli hills. It said, two leases (ML20/05 and ML8/030) were sanctioned by the office of ME Rajsamand–I and Rajsamand–II in the Aravalli hills range in 2005 for excavation of quartz and feldspar minerals. The director of mines and geology directed (belatedly in August 2006) to the mines engineers to stop mining activities immediately and declare these mines null and void. But no action was taken by the mines engineers to cancel the leases. On the contrary, the lease period of ML-5/05 was enhanced (Feb 28 2015) by the mines engineer Rajsamand–II up to March 2056 (original lease period March 2, 2006 to March 1, 2036), it noted.
 
 Besides, four mining leases spread over 15.52 hectares were sanctioned between March 2005 and January 2012 even though these leases were in Aravalli hills. The leases excavated 65,147.64 metric tonnes of minerals (feldspar, serpentine and marble) between 2010 and 2017.
 
 The report further noted that the state government directed the department to dispose of cases pending for renewal of mining leases in Aravalli hills apart from 261 mining leases submitted to the Supreme Court.
 
 On scrutiny of records of mines engineers Rajsamand–I and Rajsamand–II and AME Rishabdeo, it was found that the department renewed 18 mining leases after February 19, 2010 though they were falling under the Aravalli hills as per the departments adopted definition. These lessees had excavated 16.22 lakh MT of minerals between April 2010 and March 2017.
 
 The report noted that during the test check of records of seven AME/ME offices , it was also found that 50 leases spread over an area of 5,028.52 hectares in the Aravalli mountain range were due to expire between 1996 and March 2036. However the original lease period of these leases were extended and the lease period would now expire between March 2018 and March 2056 in violation of the apex court order.
