New Delhi: Only 5% of 3.93 lakh vehicles checked at 614 pollution under control (PUC) centres in   between January 1 and 25 failed the emission test, according to data released by Centre for Science and Environment ( ) on Friday. While this may seem like great news given the poor air quality in the capital, the tiny fail percentage raises serious questions about the efficiency of the system. 

 CSE researchers claim the data gathered from the transport department only show a huge inefficiency in dealing with vehicular emissions through the PUC system. The PUC norms for on-road vehicles are extremely lax for the older or pre-BS-IV vehicles. For diesel vehicles, only a smoke density test is carried out, which are particularly lenient—for BS-IV compliant vehicles, the norm is 50 hartridge smoke density (HSU) and 65 HSU for pre-BS-IV vehicles. 
 
 The norm in Singapore and Pakistan is 40 HSU while it is 50 HSU in Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Malaysia. “It’s like the norm itself is meant to catch the absolute worst offender. Why not also catch the other bad ones,” asked a CSE researcher. Participants at a round-table on “Reinventing in-use emissions compliance regime”, held on Friday, discussed how not only were the standards lax, but there was too much corruption in the system. 
 
 “They (PUC centres) clear the vehicles because they will not get the money for the test otherwise. We have seen it happening several times,” said a CPCB official present at the meeting. 
 
 The Supreme Court has recently directed the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) to audit all the 614 PUC stations. An audit carried out by CPCB in 2013 at 76 PUC centres had also exposed a number of anomalies, including non-compliance of the code of practice, poor condition of the laboratories, non-functioning analysers. 
 
 The CSE round-table also flagged the fact that the PUC system was not even designed to test tiny particles and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions.
