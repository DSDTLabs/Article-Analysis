HYDERABAD: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) hauled up the   ( ) for its inefficiency in solid   management.

 After the civic body submitted its report, saying the quantity of   collected in the city has doubled in five years, the audit report found there was no mechanism to assess the quantity of waste generated or collected within GHMC limits, as there are no weight bridges at transfer stations (the place where all the garbage collected from households and other places). In its report, CAG also said the quantum of municipal solid waste collected in GHMC limits was not accurately known due to the same.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 The civic body said 4,090 metric tons of waste is generated every day in its limits and waste collection have increased with every passing year. In 2016, the civic body collected 3,720 metric tons of waste.
 
 GHMC's claim about more garbage being collected means the city is more cleaner compared to previous year and also there is decrease in dumping of waste in nalas.
 
 The CAG criticised GHMC's move of distributing 43.65 lakh dustbins (for  ), saying even after the distribution of bins the segregated waste constituted 27 per cent of the total waste.
 
 The CAG also rapped GHMC for not completely upgrading the three transfer stations as promised and not constructing the five new transfer stations. According to audit report, upgradation works were partially completed only in one location (Imbliban). Required land for new transfer stations was not provided by GHMC and the work also got delayed due to non-finalization of drawings.
 
 CAG recommended GHMC to prepare drawings, including layout and structural details and include provisions such as weight bridges and computerised system for billing, tracking vehicle movement and segregation facility.
