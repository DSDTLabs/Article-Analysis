NOIDA: Tension prevailed in   village of the Bisrakh area near Noida Extension on Friday after a statue of B R Ambedkar was found vadalised. Locals said it was an attempt to instigate   in the village ahead of   on Saturday. The vandalism is suspected to have happened on Thursday night and came to light early on Friday when morning walkers spotted the damaged ears and nose of the statue that stands inside a park in the village close to Mahagun Mywoods housing society in Noida Extension. 

  As soon as the news spread, local residents gathered at the spot and staged a protest, demanding the arrest of the culprits. They dispersed only after the district administration brought a new metal statue from Aligarh and replaced the old one, made of cement, in the afternoon. Local residents said the village has no history of communal divide. "This can only be aimed at disrupting Ambedkar Jayanti celebrations on April 14," Kuldeep Singh, a local resident, said. The village has 60% Jatav and Dhobi population and 40% Yadavs. 
 
 "The statue was installed at the park 25 years ago. In 2010, Noida   beautified the park, adding a fence and some neem trees. The boundary collapsed at several points and there is no check on people's entry," Singh said.
 
 "We have registered a case against unknown persons for vandalism," said SP (rural) Suniti. SDM (Dadri) Amit Kumar said "We are taking all necessary action."
