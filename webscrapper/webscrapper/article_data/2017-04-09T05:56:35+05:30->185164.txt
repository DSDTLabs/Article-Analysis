NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Friday evening received a   call about a man brutally beating up his wife in west Delhi's Bindapur. Cops rushed a team to the flat, but found it to be locked. They entered the house from the terrace and found the woman in an unconscious state.

 While she was being taken to the hospital, cops came to know that her husband was on his way to commit suicide at a railway track nearby. When a police team tracked him down, he started running away and was almost run over by a train when he was pulled out the way.
 
 “The man claimed to have consumed alcohol and had attacked his wife during an argument with a sharp object. He was counselled and handed over to the local police,“ said DCP (PCR)  .
