AGRA: For the first time,   ( ) has begun collecting information on saplings planted by social groups and private organizations in the city. The civic body is trying to ascertain how many saplings were planted, where and who is taking care of them and if any help is required from the corporation.
 
  Talking with TOI, Arun Prakash, municipal commissioner and nodal officer for the committee formed for this particular task, said, “We are trying to get the figures of total saplings planted by private organizations in the monsoon as also the spot where those plants have been planted. We are ready to help these organizations to maintain those plants.”
  
  This is the first time that AMC has undertaken the task on its own.
  
  As part of its initiative to make the city “smart”, municipal corporation is collecting the data of plantation done by the private organizations this monsoon. The AMC officials are taking help of social media to reach out and contact the organizations and people involved in the plantation drive to compile a data of total saplings planted by the private sector.
  
  Sources in the AMC said many people either forgot to take care of the saplings as they plant. Now, private societies and organizations have started to assure the corporation that they will take care of these saplings. On its part, the AMC has offered to protect the saplings by making available tree guards and if need be, the service of their personnel to dig up a pit in the ground to plant the saplings.
