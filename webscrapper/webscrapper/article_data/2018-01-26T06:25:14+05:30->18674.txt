BATHINDA: After facing heat due to continuous protests of employees over shutting down of Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant here, another protest is staring in the face of the 10-month-old   government, especially finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. Residents of nearly 12 residential colonies in the vicinity of a solid waste management plant situated on the Bathinda-Mansa road have threatened to raise their voice against the non-shifting of the waste plant away from their habitation.

 The   has called a meeting on Republic Day to decide the mode of protest after the state government, according to them, had failed to fulfil its pre-poll promise of shifting the plant from the present location. Taking up the demand of residents, the Congress before assembly elections in 2017 had promised to look for another location for the plant.
 
 After hanging fire for many months due to some matter raised by the   (NGT), the solid waste plant in   had started operations nearly a year ago.
 
 Though earlier the solid waste of only Bathinda totalling nearly 100 tonnes per day was being collected at the solid waste plant but now on the directions of the NGT, 350 tonnes solid waste per day is expected to be collected from 18 municipal councils from March.
 
 Bathinda   commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal said, “Though the municipal authorities had tried to look into some alternative place to shift the plant, but no proper land could be found. The authorities will be using a spray of an eco-friendly medicine ‘Ecolo’ to almost eliminate the foul smell.”
