TV personality  , who will be hosting the 89th   on Sunday, has vowed to "keep his 'longtime frenemy' and actor-producer   offstage." 

 Damon's film "Manchester by the Sea" is up for the best picture Oscar but he might have trouble collecting the trophy if the movie wins, as the 49-year-old popular talk show host has no plans to drop the pair's long-standing infamous feud anytime soon, according to The  .
 
  
 "I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that he (Damon) doesn't win or doesn't know that he won. My goal is to keep him offstage," Kimmel said. 
 
 The two stars fake feud started during the third season of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" in 2005 when Kimmel off-handedly ended a discouraging show by apologising to Damon, 46, for bumping him out of the show. 
 
 Since then the pair have continued to pull pranks on each other with Kimmel spoofing Damon's film "The Martian".
