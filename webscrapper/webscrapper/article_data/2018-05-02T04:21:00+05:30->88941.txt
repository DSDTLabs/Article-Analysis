Vadodara: A group of Kshatriyas from Padamla village near the city made representations to the police commissioner on Tuesday after five persons from their community were booked for the rioting that took place during a wedding procession of a Dalit family on April 25.

 In a memorandum submitted to the police commissioner and the district collector, they informed that a miscreant had written on the notice board outside a local dairy on April 21 that led to misunderstanding among the villagers. The complainant had told the police last week that Kshatriyas of the village had allegedly written ‘Only Kshatriyas can hold marriage procession and Dalits cannot. If Dalits will hold marriage procession…’ on the notice board.
 
 The representatives also said that the complaint given by Dalits at Chhani police station is also cooked up and innocents have been booked. “We held a peace meeting in the village before the stone pelting incident but when the rioting started, nobody from the community was involved. In fact, some people from the wedding procession raised slogans and pelted stones,” the memorandum stated.
 
 After the incident on April 25, when another wedding procession of a Dalit family was to be taken out on Sunday night, police had made enough security arrangements to thwart any untoward incident. On April 28, police had even arrested eight people from both the communities.
