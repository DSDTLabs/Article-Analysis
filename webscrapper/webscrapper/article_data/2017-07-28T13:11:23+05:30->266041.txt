MOHALI: Students of government primary school in   village in Sector 68,   were sent home on Thursday as the school was submerged in ankle-deep water in just a few hours of rainfall. 

 The school building is in a dilapidated state. The walls are damp and rainwater seeps through. Water also seeps into the classroom, said school principal  .
 
 “We have made four to five complaints with the education department about the poor condition of the school building. We fear it may not stand wear and tear, in which case, there will be a major accident. Rain water seeped into classrooms on Thursday and we were forced to send students of classes 1 to III back home. Other classes were held on the first floor of the building. The walls and ceiling of the school are damp and the ceiling drips in many places.”
 
 According to him, the first complaint was filed in February 2016. Since then, four more complaints have been filed but no action has been taken.
 
 The damp boundary wall of the school is also caked with weeds. Overall, the building is damaged and needs major repairs. Local councillor   said she would raise the issue with higher authorities so that action is taken before an accident occurs. The school has 255 children with six teachers and one principal.
