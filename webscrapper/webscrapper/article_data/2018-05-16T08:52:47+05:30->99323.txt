CHANDIGARH: Taking note of Rs 12 crore embezzlement of paddy stocks, Punjab’s food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Tuesday ordered an FIR against two rice millers and suspended three officials of Punjab State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (Punsup) for negligence.

 Suspended officials were Amritpal Singh, district in-charge of Punsup Faridkot and Muktsar; Hansa Singh, a Faridkot official; and Gurdeep Singh, inspector at Malout.
 
 The department officials said proceedings to impose major penalties have also been initiated for shortage of paddy stock equivalent to 96 wagons of rice worth Rs 7.20 crore and 63 wagons of rice worth Rs 4.72 crore detected in Everest Rice Industries at Faridkot, owned by Malkiat Singh, and Amyra Foods Private Limited at Lambi, owned by Rajveer Singh and Satvir Sharma, respectively.
