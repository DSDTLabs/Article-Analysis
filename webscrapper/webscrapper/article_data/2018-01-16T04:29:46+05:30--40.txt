NEW DELHI: After hanging fire for nearly two months, Delhi government’s   for   of   has been   by LG Anil  . The LG, who had earlier sent back the proposal for “reconsideration”, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had assured him that “the government will simultaneously work to plug the gaps in the system”.

 The CM was quick to take to twitter to thank LG. “Hon'ble @LtGovDelhi approves Delhi govt’s scheme for ‘Doorstep delivery of services’. All citizens of Delhi are grateful to u sir. Thank u,” he tweeted.
 
 The government has reportedly told LG that it plans to enable young entrepreneurs to come up with “internet kiosks” with adequate safeguards, from where the services can be accessed. A suitable financial model will also be worked out to provide soft loans, if needed, to the educated unemployed to set up these “kiosks”. A statement from the LG’s office said: “On the assurance that both systems will function as complementary to each other, Hon’ble LG approved the proposal and advised the administrative department concerned to finalise the proposal for setting up internet kiosks within a month (sic).” 
 
 Baijal had advised the government to reconsider the proposal and focus on digital delivery of services, “as 35 out of 40 services listed in the scheme are already available online”.
