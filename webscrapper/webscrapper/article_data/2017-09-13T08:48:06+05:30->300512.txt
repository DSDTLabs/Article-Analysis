CHENNAI: For a while, an assured 17-year-old   (2/23 in 8 overs) was troubling the big guns of Australia - Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell. The Tamil Nadu offspinner, the only shining light on the day for Board President's XI, first claimed the Aussie skipper and soon induced an error from the dangerous Maxwell.

 The young BP XI bowling unit had done reasonably well to put the brakes on the dashing Aussie batting line-up reducing them to 158 for four in 28.2 overs. But soon the youngsters got a taste of what playing at the top level is all about thanks to a masterclass in batting from the Australian middle-order and bowling attack.
 
  and Matthew Wade put on an exhibition of hitting - striking nine sixes between them - against the inexperienced BP XI bowling while the Aussie bowling attack, comprising  , Kane Richardson, James Faulkner, Pat Cummins, Stoinis, spinners Adam Zampa and Ashton Agar (444), stifled the home side by not giving an inch from the outset.
 
 The young guns who impressed in the last IPL such as Rahul Tripathi (7), Nitish Rana (19) and Washington (11) failed to make it count against a quality attack. Ambidextrous spinner Akshay Karnewar (6-0-59-1) and skipper Gurkeerat (6-0-44-0) were taken to the cleaners by Stoinis and Travis Head (65).
 
 Coach Hemang Badani admitted it was a “reality check” for them. “They need to go back and figure out what needs to be done from here if they want to take their careers forward. Australia are one of the best sides in the world.
 
 Playing a match against them gives our boys an opportunity to let them know where they stand,” Badani said.
 
 Skipper Gurkeerat said the whole experience was a “bonus” for those who featured in the match. “It was great exposure for them to play against such experienced players. It is always beneficial when you get a taste of that level,” said Gurkeerat, who scored 27.
