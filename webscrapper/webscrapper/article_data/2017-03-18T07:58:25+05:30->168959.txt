AHMEDABAD: Against the practice of scheduling a day’s gap between two papers in the   for class 10 and 12 students, around 1,000 students of class 12   will have to take two tests in a day. 

 There are around 92 subjects in the general stream from which students have to opt for seven with fixed and elective subjects.It so happens that students do not get the option of selecting their subjects. They are usually dependent on the schools because most schools don’t have faculty members for all subjects. 
 
 Thus, students opt for only those subjects for which faculty members are available in their schools Due to this situation, there are three days when around 1,000 students will end up appearing for exams for two subjects in a day. On Saturday, the exam for secretarial practice will be held in the morning while the geography paper is scheduled in the evening. 
 
 On Monday, the music exam will be administered in the morning and the exam for first language is scheduled in the evening. On March 30, general stream students will take two exams:  .
 
  B S Kella, the   of the  , said: “We have instructed schools to provide subject options in such a way that students don’t have to appear for two papers in a day.” There are 92 subjects in the general stream and the board exams are supposed to be completed in a stipulated time so it is not possible to schedule all papers on individual days, Kella said.
