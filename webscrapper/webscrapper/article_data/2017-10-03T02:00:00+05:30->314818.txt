PATNA: Opposition RJD and Congress called the   against child marriage and dowry launched by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday a political gimmick. 

 RJD vice-president Shivanand Tiwary called Nitish an ‘event manager’ with whom no one could compete. “The CM had announced various programmes and initiatives for Champaran Satyagrah centenary. Nitish had told me he was determined to provide land to the landless and if his government failed in doing so, the centenary would just be an event. Now the landless people will stage dharna outside Bhitiharwa ashram from where Mahatma Gandhi had started his satyagrah to remind Nitish of his promises,” Tiwary said.
 
 Congress leader Akhilesh Singh criticised Nitish for joining hands with the “killers of Gandhi”. “Nitish has said he will arrest priests, members of band party and even the bride’s family in case of child marriage. Is it a Taliban?”
 
 Congress spokesman Prem Chand Mishra also took a jibe at Nitish for trying to establish Deendayal Upadhyaya as Gandhi. 
 
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son and former state health minister Tej Pratap Yadav said, “Law against child marriage and dowry is already there. When my father was the CM, he had also worked on these issues.”
 
 Comparing this campaign with Nitish’s previously launched prohibition, Tej Pratap said, “All his campaigns have failed.” He cited the example of his parents’ wedding and said his maternal grandfather had gifted a wooden bed and other things to his mother Rabri Devi. “A father always gives gifts to his daughter at the time of her marriage. It cannot be called dowry,” he said. 
 
 However, Rabri gave thumbs up to Nitish’s campaign and urged him to make stringent law so that a girl child gets share in her parents’ property.
