Panaji: The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) has hailed the union government for its ‘Adopt a Monument’ scheme that envisages maintenance of historic monuments.

 “The scheme is a very good concept. There is a need to privatise the upkeep of heritage historical monuments all over India, and even in Goa, keeping in mind that we have national monuments and state protected monuments,” a TTAG official said.
 
 “Goa needs to follow suit with regards to state protected monuments. In doing so, the government needs to distinguish between religious and non-religious historical monuments. As far as religious momuments are concerned, there is a need to follow a consultative process between the government and religious body,” the official added.
