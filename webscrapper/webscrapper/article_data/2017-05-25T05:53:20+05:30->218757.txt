NEW DELHI: Sports minister   on Wednesday announced a scheme, ‘adopt a slum’, to mark three years of the Modi government. To be initiated under the aegis of the   (NYKS), the   will double up as a political outreach programme,   said.

 “Under this scheme, all the various initiatives of the central government like  , Modi app, Digital India etc will be implemented and showcased,” he said.
 
 Earmarked for a May 26 launch, starting with a “slum run”, the scheme will be the first time that NYKS, an autonomous organisation, will be setting up base in urban slums. Till now, NYKS has been concentrating on setting up youth clubs in rural areas. 
 
 Goel said the scheme, which will be monitored through youth clubs, will canvas support from local politicians, RWAs, Rotary Clubs etc. “I have asked councillors, MLAs and MPs to come forward and adopt slums,” said Goel, adding he had “adopted” Indira Basti in Timarpur. Interestingly, Timarpur is in the constituency of Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.
 
 The outreach programme, which has already faced internal resistance with reports of Tiwari being against it, had the party’s support, Goel claimed. Admitting that there were “misunderstandings” with Tiwari, which were since “resolved”, Goel said, “I am happy to say that the meeting of the BJP state national executive on Tuesday discussed the scheme and ways to implement it.” According to insiders, Tiwari has been wary of Goel’s insistence on promoting the “adopt a slum” scheme, which will give the central minister a more visible profile in local politics.
