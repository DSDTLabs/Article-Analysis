MUMBAI: This is one source of ‘earnings’ the cashstrapped BEST cannot pocket. In the last seven years, more than Rs 1 crore—in wallets, purses, bags and plastic packets—has been left behind on buses by commuters. Of this, 41% has been handed back to those who approached BEST’s lostand-found department in  . The rest lies unclaimed. 

  is the number one lost item on buses, followed by mobile phones and sunglasses. Other lost articles include books, medicines, umbrellas (mainly during monsoon), cameras, jewellery,   and tablets, and perishable items like home-cooked food in tiffin boxes. 
 
 Often, tiffin boxes are the reason why the police are called to ensure that the item is not a bomb. 
 
 Overall, 14,594 articles were left behind on BEST buses in 2016-17, of which 12,267 remain unclaimed. The number of lost articles the previous year was 12,161. 
 
 BEST officials have appealed to commuters to take care of belongings and check them before alighting from buses. 
 
 Nearly 60% of lost cash or jewellery remain unclaimed. 
 
 Officials said BEST has lockers to store lost cash. 
 
 “When one claims lost cash, one has to pay a premium of 12% of the claimed value as storage charge,” said an official. 
 
 One can make an application to claim a lost article at BEST’s lost-and-found section at the Wadala depot for up to 30 days, after which it is auctioned. 
 
 BEST will charge nominal registration and storage charges before returning lost property.
