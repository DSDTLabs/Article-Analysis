Sri Balaji, who made Kullanari Koottam with   and  , has now completed shooting his next,  , which, he says, is a city-based romcom. “There is a saying in Tamil, kaiku ettinadhu vaaikku ettala. In the film, three characters, played by hero Mithun,   and  , are after something and who gets it in the end is what the plot is all about. There is also a cute romantic track between   and Sruthi Ramakrishna,” he reveals. 

 The film also has a   as part of its cast and the director states that the dog is the biggest strength of the film, as it is sure to appeal to kids and family audiences. “The Golden Retriever is Appukutty’s pet, and will be a constant presence in the scenes between Appukutty and Mithun, who play friends from a small-town who bump into each other in the city.”
 
 Balaji says that rather than breeds like Alsatian or Rajapalayam, which look terrifying, he wanted a dog that looked appealing. However, the team couldn’t find any trained Golden Retriever at all. They enquired with many vets in the city and finally zeroed in on this particular golden retriever, called Douglas. However, they had to train the animal because it is actually someone’s pet. “We hired an animal trainer, who visited the pet’s place every day for three months, and trained him,” he informs, adding that they also got the required approvals for using the dog from the Animal Welfare Board of India. The director also made Appukutty visit the dog at its home and spend some time with him as he wanted the two to become familiar with each other as the dog had to listen to Apputkutty’s instructions in the film.
 
 Interestingly, in every scene that the dog appears, you will hear his mind-voice, informs the filmmaker. “The dog will provide counters to the hero’s actions and I wanted a voice that captures the nakkal in its punchlines. The voice had to be familiar as well, so, we roped in   from Adithya TV to lend his voice. His performance is sure to crack you up,” says Balaji.
