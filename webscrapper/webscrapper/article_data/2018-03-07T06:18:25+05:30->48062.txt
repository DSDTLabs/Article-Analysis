HYDERABAD: Few   cameras at government   make it easy for   to   taps, bed sheets and even pillows, reveal insiders. 

 Incidentally, taps are the most stolen object from hospitals. Even after replacements every few months, they are stolen again. "It isn't possible to screen each and every attendant coming in and going out of the wards. Often attendants are on the lookout to steal things," said a doctor, working at OGH. Doctors are also afraid to call out patient attendants even if they know of a   due to lack of security, an insider said. 
 
 There have been past incidents where doctors have been manhandled by attendants over treatments, delay in attending to the patient or in cases when the attendants blamed the death of a patient on the doctor. 
 
 "Doctors themselves do not feel safe inside the hospitals and every time there is an incident they go on a strike. They are assured of increase in safety measures but the ground reality has remained the same for years now. It is demoralizing and unnerving for us to see our fellow doctors being threatened or hit," added a junior doctor at the Gandhi hospital.
 
 On one hand, the health department has been buying high-end equipment and upgrading the operation theatres in government hospitals, on the other hand, the crucial issue of allotting adequate sanitation and security staff has remained an unaddressed issue, throwing all the efforts down the drain.
