SURAT: Medical students in the   will join the nationwide stir on Wednesday against the Centre’s proposal to hold an exit test (National Exit Test or NEXT) for MBBS graduates to qualify for medical practice.

 Students from government and private medical colleges will boycott classes and hold protests and rallies outside their colleges. 
 
 The protest is being conducted under the aegis of Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Surat branch.
 
 Secretary of IMA-Surat, Dr   said, “Over 15,000 students in 20 medical colleges across Gujarat will participate in the  . The students will organize rallies and protest programmes outside their respective college gates. The students will be flashing placards of ‘Hume padhne do’ during the protest.”
 
 Dr Vadgama added, “A medical student goes through a series examinations in all subjects - theory, clinical and viva - with the bar being already set high at 50% marks. Subjecting the budding doctors to exit exam is nothing but harassment. The same bill also plans to exempt foreign graduates from qualifying the examination for practice in India, which is bizarre.”
