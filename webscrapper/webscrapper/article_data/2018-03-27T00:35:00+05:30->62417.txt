Namakkal: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami inaugurated a rail overbridge at Pallipalaym, a police station at Veppadai and laid foundation stone for a bridge near Cauvery railway station on Monday.  After the inaugural function, the chief minister told reporters that he would face any challenges with the blessings of former chief ministers MGR and Jayalalithaa. “We would succeed in overcoming all the issues with people’s support,” he said. “All the opposition parties, including DMK, daydreamed that my government would fall before the budget. Then they thought my government would be dissolved before the budget session concludes. All their wishful thoughts have been belied. We had completed one year and stepped into the second year,” he said. Mentioning Tiruchengode and Erode as industrial towns, Palaniswami said his government has given uninterrupted power supply at free of cost even during summer season. Recalling erratic power cuts during the DMK regime, the CM said Jayalalithaa made Tamil Nadu as power-excess state as she had promised during her 2006-2011 tenure as chief minister.  He said Tiruchengode is the only town which has ‘four-lane’ connectivity in all the corners of the town. School education minister K A Sengottaiyan, electricity minister P Thangamani, social welfare minister Dr Saroja, environmental minister K C Karuppannan, transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar, Namakkal district collector Asia Mariam, Erode district collector S Prabhakar and other party functionaries participated in the event.
