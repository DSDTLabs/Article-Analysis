MUMBAI: Nearly a week after 650 security personnel marched into the city's public hospitals to man entry points, the crowd at campuses has declined by 40%, senior BMC officials said on Friday. Not used to such elaborate security arrangements in public hospitals, many citizens and local politicians have complained to deans about inconvenience.

 At KEM, Sion and Nair hospitals, the difference was pronounced where emergency areas were always teeming with people. At Sion and KEM particularly, the crowd has dipped by 50% as entry of people is strictly monitored physically and through CCTV cameras.
 
 At  , access gates for patients have been reduced to two, and only those with valid passes are allowed. These hospitals used to record a daily footfall of 10,000-30,000 people.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner IS Kundan confirmed there has been up to 40% fall in footfalls since guards from   took charge.“This will help us instil discipline, maintain cleanliness and hygiene. In future, helpdesks and signages will be put up to help patients,“ she said.
 
 The corporation intends to spread awareness about implications of assaulting a doctor by putting up posters. “Doctors too will be sensitized to treat patients with patience and dignity,“ she said.
 
 But crowd management has come with its share of issues. “We are getting many complaints from patients as well as local politicians after security was tightened. But we are committed to instil a sense of discipline,“ said KEM dean Dr Avinash Supe. Crowd management during OPD hours though is proving to be a challenge.   dean Dr   said the new security has made a huge impact. “During OPD hours, we are trying to restrict the number of relatives to one. While few doctors were upset that they too were asked for ID cards, we have explained to them that it's for their good,“ he said. Incidents of theft from the hospital have also declined, a source said.
