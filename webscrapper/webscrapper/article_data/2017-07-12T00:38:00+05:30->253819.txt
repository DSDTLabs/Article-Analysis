 Chandigarh: A 64-year-old rice mill owner tried to immolate himself in the parking lot of the Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday noon.
 
 Sources said Surinder Kumar of Dhuri in Sangrur reached the court premises with a poisonous substance and two bottles of diesel, accusing the Punjab Police of not taking any action on his complaint of fraud against his manager.
 
 Kumar alleged the manager duped him of more than Rs 50 crore. He alleged he lodged a complaint with the local police but no action was taken. To grab the attention of the judiciary and Punjab Police, he said he tried to commit suicide.
 
 At the parking lot, Kumar allegedly consumed the poison first and then poured the diesel on his body and set himself afire. Passers-by rescued him and informed the police. A police control room vehicle took him to Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16. Kumar received injuries on his legs. He is stated to be out of danger and under observation.
 
 The police have registered a case against him. Police said they were waiting for his medical report.
