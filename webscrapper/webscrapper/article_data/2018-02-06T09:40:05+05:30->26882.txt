CHANDIGARH: The farm crisis is something more than a minimum support price ( ) issue, said Ramon Magsaysay award winner and renowned journalist P Sainath, who was at   to deliver a public lecture on inequality and agrarian distress on Monday. The agrarian crisis,   said, is no more a measurement of input cost. It is not just the measure of the loss of life but it is the measure of our loss of humanity.

 “The farm crisis is something more than an MSP issue. There are other gains to the MSP. I can declare an MSP of Rs 5,000 tomorrow on wheat. But, if the government does not procure, who is going to buy it? There is zero planning for this. So, what happens is, you declare an MSP of Rs 5,000, the farmer goes to the trader who offers him Rs 1, 800- take it or leave it. He is still at the mercy of the trader. The procurement centres are declining in crop after crop. The government is out of the procurement game. You can just theoretically declare any MSP, but then nothing happens,” said Sainath, who has so far visited more than 900 households in 11 regions where farmer suicides have occurred.
 
 Quoting the Census, Sainath said on an average, India is losing 2,000 farmers a day. “If you compare the 1991, 2001 and 2011 Census data, the number of farmers, the main cultivators, has fallen down by 15 million. Between 1991 and 2001 census, the number of main cultivators has fallen down by 7.2 million and from 2001 to 2011 census, the number has declined by another 7.7 million.” The data showed that the farmers are mostly transforming into agricultural labourers, he said. “As the number of farmers is declining, the number of agriculture labourers is exploding,” he pointed out.
 
 Elaborating on the agrarian crisis in the country, Sainath said the crisis has gone up further.
