BHOPAL: Seeing the BSF ' ' team's breathtaking display on R-Day, no one was perhaps more awestruck than their trainer -  , deputy commander of the force's Motor Transport School in Gwalior.

 When the girls reported to him for training 15 months ago, he was shocked to know that most of them didn't even know how to ride a bicycle. "But once the training got going, we had 15 expert riders within a month, which is exemplary. I found that the girls were better in following instructions and more disciplined than men," said Chandra.
 
 The training phase was an eye-opener for him, too, Chandra says. "The last 15 months have been a learning process. I discovered that women are far stronger than men - mentally, emotionally as well as physically. None of the volunteers backed down due to the difficulties, which is truly admirable," said the BSF officer.
 
 BSF DG K K Sharma had conceived the idea of making an all-women daredevil team in October 2016. The team was ready to perform at Rajpath in little over a year's time.
 
 To put it in perspective, Chandra said: "Our (all-male) Jaanbaaz team at Gwalior was formed in 1989, but they hadn't been able to perform at Rajpath within 15 months, something our 'Seema Bhawani' did with grace. I cannot take the whole credit as the six instructors under me and the planning team did a marvelous job in contributing to their success."
