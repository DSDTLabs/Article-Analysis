Nagpur: The Forest Rangers Association, Maharashtra, has threatened to strike work if action is taken against two range forest officers (RFOs) investigating the Pench tiger poaching cases.

 On Friday, over 25 association members will meet principal secretary (forest) Vikas Kharge at Amravati where he will inaugurate the two-day conference of forest officers.
 
 In a release, president and general secretary of the association KV Bolke and Atul Deokar respectively said the police should immediately scrap the FIR registered against RFOs Pandurang Pakhale and Nilesh Gawande.
 
 “On the lines of police officers, the two investigating forest officials should also be granted protection unless a probe by sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) doesn’t find them guilty. The officials are ready for any impartial probe but no action should be taken under pressure from some local leaders,” said Bolke and Deokar.
 
 “If the locals feel the officials are bias, an impartial special investigating team (SIT) should be set up. The poaching links are deep-rooted and there are major players who are still at large. The accused seem to be closely connected with leaders having links to illegal Pench fishing, a lucrative business running into crores,” the association members have said.
 
 “The police complaint by accused Devidas Kumre, from whom 12kg tiger bones were seized, is an attempt to scuttle the probe going on in the right direction. Kumre has already told the court, doctors, police and jail officials that he was injured while running away,” said Bolke.
 
 The association alleged the Congress leaders are instigating local tribals to stage protest to put pressure to close the case. There is recovery of tiger body parts from the accused and the case needs to be taken to its logical end.
 
 On Friday, the members will be joined by ACF & DFO association. Several Amravati and Nagpur-based NGOs working for wildlife conservation will also be present.
