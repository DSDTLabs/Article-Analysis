Chandigarh: With the Supreme Court on Tuesday directing the Punjab government to respect and execute its orders regarding construction of the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, the political parties in Haryana have appealed to the neighbouring state and the Centre to make serious efforts to implement the court orders.

 Welcoming the decision, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has appealed to the Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh to take immediate steps to ensure construction of the SYL Canal in Punjab territory.
 
 “I thank the Supreme Court for its orders on the SYL Canal issue. The apex court has done justice. I appeal to the Punjab CM, Capt Amarinder Singh ji, for his cooperation in construction of the SYL Canal on Punjab territory for the benefit of farmers in both states,” Khattar said.
 
 Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda of the Congress has asked Khattar and the other opposition parties to organize and pressurize the Centre for early completion of canal.
 
 “We welcome the decision and now is the time for all political parties in the state to unite on this issue in Haryana’s interest. We have already assured CM Khattar about our support as political party on this issue,” Hooda added.
 
 Reacting on the SC order, INLD MP Dushyant Chautala, whose party had on Monday blocked highways over the SYL canal issue, said if Punjab was not willing to implement the verdict, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should come forward to ensure that it was done.
 
 Chautala also appealed to the PM to deploy paramilitary forces or any other agency for completion of the construction of SYL canal. He would contact all MPs from Haryana in Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha appealing them to meet the PM jointly on the issue, he added.
 
 When asked about the SC’s order asking not to resort any agitation on the issue, Leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala said holding protest in a peaceful manner was constitutional right and he would ensure peaceful protests.
