BENGALURU:   and  , the Dalai Lama, on Tuesday said the biggest threat to humanity is one-sided education.“We only teach material values to our children and there is no effort to make them learn more important  . This is the most destructive weapon for humanity ,“ he said in an interview to The Times of India on Tuesday .

 The absence of a holistic education leads to greed and human intelligence is used for destructive purposes. “The current system of education only promotes more material culture. It is short-sighted,“ said the 14th Dalai Lama.
 
 The spiritual leader said a draft curriculum with secularism and ethics is being readied. “We hope to pilot it as a lesson in schools. This will ensure that the next generation will be much better in terms of inner values. I may not be able to see that in my lifetime. But it will happen,“ said the 81-year-old world leader.
 
 Throughout his 40-minute interaction, he emphasized that the root of compassion and values originated from the Indian masters and dated back to 2000 years. “My 58-year stay in India has convinced me that religious harmony is possible. Today , wherever I go, I make an effort to talk about harmony and peace. India is the land of ahimsa, which means compassion here is stronger.“
