COIMBATORE: The city police on Thursday got the custody of the three Muslim youths, who surrendered before the judicial magistrate court–V in connection with the   (DVK) member H Farook’s murder case, till Friday evening.

 Farook, 31, of Bilal Estate at  , was hacked to death by a six-member gang near a slaughter house at Ukkadam on March 16. Farook, an atheist, had created a WhatsApp group and posted rationalistic views against his religion. He also had posted similar views on Facebook page. Following this, some radical outfits had threatened him not to function against the religion. But,   didn’t mend his ways.
 
 Following his murder, Anshath, Samsudheen and   surrendered before the judicial magistrate court-V, while Akram Sindhaa, Jaffer Ali and Abdul Munaf were arrested by the city police.
 
 On Tuesday,   Street police had moved the judicial magistrate court-V, seeking custody of Ansath, Saddam Hussain and Samsudheen for five days to grill them in connection with the murder case.
 
 When the petition came up for hearing on Wednesday, defence council Zakeriya strongly objected to the police custody of the trio. Magistrate R Selvakumar then postponed the hearing for Thursday.
 
 On Thursday morning, the three were produced before the court, which sent them in police custody till Friday 5pm. The trio was subsequently taken to the Big   police station for interrogation.
 
 Meanwhile,   (MMK) president MH Jawahirullah met the Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) general secretary K Ramakrishnan at Gandhipuram and expressed his condolence on Farook’s death.
