BENGLURU: Criminal Investigation Department ( ) sleuths, who are probing the alleged doping of a race horse, on Thursday questioned top officials of Bangalore  , including its veterinarian.

 A posse of CID officials visited the club to inspect the stable of Queen Latifa, the filly, and collected more samples. They also questioned other staff and took photos, sources said. Veterinarian Mahesh, chairman Jagannath, CEO Nirmal Prasad and chief stipendiary steward Pradyumna Singh were questioned, sources added. 
 
 “In the coming days, we will question more officials, including the horse trainer and manager,” investigators said, adding that no confirmation on any arrests could be made at this juncture.
 
 The probe began after a report from the National Doping Test Laboratory, New Delhi, confirmed the doping of three-year-old Queen Latifa, based on which, H Sanjeevaiah Chandregowda, member of the management committee of the Karnataka Race Horse Owners’ Association, lodged a complaint with High Grounds police on April 20. He named five club officials in the complaint.
 
 The filly was allegedly doped before a race held on March 5. The case was later transferred to CID. Samples of Queen Latifa — which won the Karnataka Racehorse Owners’ Association Million Cup — were collected on March 5 after the race. The incident took place during the richest race weekend this year, with the Invitation Cup being the biggest draw. 
 
 Lab results said the horse tested positive for a local anaesthetic, procaine. The International Equestrian Federation (FEI) classifies the drug under the ‘controlled medication’ category. Though deemed to have therapeutic value and commonly used in equine medicine, controlled medication has the potential to affect performance and/or be a welfare risk to the horse, FEI had said.
