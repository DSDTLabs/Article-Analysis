New Delhi: The   ( ) on Tuesday issued a   to Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), central government, in connection with a complaint filed by a blind woman alleging cancellation of appointment in   (IRAS) by the railway ministry due to her disability. 

 The commission has sought -- within a week -- the factual report of the woman’s candidature, reasons for rejection of IRAS service initially allocated to her and the proposed action plan of the DoPT to resolve the issue and compensate.
 
 The woman, who qualified the civil services examination in 2015, has alleged that she was initially allotted a job in IRAS. However, her appointment was cancelled because of her disability and later when she followed it up with DoPT, she was reallocated a job in Postal and Telecommunication, Accounts and Finance Service, the woman alleged.
 
 “While she was allocated the IRAS service as per her rank in CSE-2015, she has now been allocated a job which is in contravention of her rank, merit and preference of service,” said the notice issued by DCW chief   to DoPT secretary BP Sharma.
 
 “It is evident that the lady has already undergone a great deal of struggle and after painstaking efforts has cleared the civil services examination. Crucial time of training and foundation course has been wasted due to systemic delays. Therefore, it is necessary that immediate action is taken to rectify the same,” the notice further read.
 
 In her representation to Maliwal, the complainant has said that at present she is pursuing PhD from Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Born with a weak eyesight, I became completely blind at the age of 6. Surgeries were done but my retina could not be reattached. However, without wasting much time, I started learning Braille and continued with my studies. For this, I had to leave the comfort of home and stayed at a hostel for blind,” she said in her representation to DCW.
