PANAJI: US-based financial services multinational   ( ) is looking to increase its presence in the state, especially in small and mid-size retail segment.

 “Since our card members are spending most across lodging and dining in Goa, these two categories will be our focus area for expansion in the region,” CEO at American Express Banking Corp India, Manoj Adlakha, said. To try and broaden the expenditure base and increase revenue, Amex wants to rope in local merchants and retail outlets and is offering customized offers to get a toehold in Goa.
 
 Local merchants and high-end retail outlets are being offered access to high-spending foreign clients and corporate card members, who are more likely to possess an American Express credit or charge card and engage in high value transactions.
 
 “We want to ensure our card members can use their American Express cards every day for virtually all their purchases. We have made great progress in expanding our merchant network in places like retail, fuel stations, grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and online merchants,” Adlakha said.
 
 The company is exploring tie-ups with India’s largest public and private sector banks which already have a sizeable presence in Goa.
 
 “We have expanded our acquisition network by partnering with SBI and   merchant services under our OptBlue programme to expand our merchant coverage, especially in the small and medium merchant space,” Adlakha said.
