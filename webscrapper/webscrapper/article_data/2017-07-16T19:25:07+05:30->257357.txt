 Hitting out at 
  government, Sonia said "numbers may be against us, but battle must be fought and fought hard."
 
 "We can't and must not let India be hostage to those who wish to impose upon it narrow-minded, divisive and communal vision," the   said.
 
 "We must have confidence in the values we believe in. This election represents a clash of ideas, a conflict of disparate values. The election demands a vote of conscience to preserve the India that the Mahatma and that illustrious generation of freedom fighters, joined by thousands upon thousands of ordinary men and women, fought for," she said.
 
 She added, "The President and the Vice-President are the constitutional heads of state. They are entrusted to discharge duties of offices in a manner that preserves, protects, defends both Constitution and the law".
 
 Claiming that both of these are, sadly, under siege today, Sonia said,"Together, Meiraji, Gopalkrishnaji will give us best possible President and vice-president to steer society through crisis that has beset our country."
