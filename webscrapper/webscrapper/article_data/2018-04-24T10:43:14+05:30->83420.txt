 S-I   and constable  , posted at   police station in Mahoba had stopped a truck carrying illegally excavated river sand. 
 
 The driver fled abandoning the truck and informed his kin. A female relative of the driver reached the spot and started arguing with the policemen and got crushed by the truck when Vansh Gopal was at the wheels. 
 
 DIG law and order   said that both cops were placed under suspension immediately. 
 
 "They stopped the truck which was not under the jurisdiction of Kul Pahad police station but came under limits of Ajner police station," said Kumar.
 
 Mahoba SP N Kolanchi said that an FIR was being lodged against the two cops. 
 
 "The family is waiting for their relatives from Kanpur and would then give complaint. They said that the woman was killed intentionally and hence a case of murder would be registered," said Kolanchi who has deputed an additional SP to probe the matter.
 
  Following reports of cops extorting money from illegal mining players, former DGP Sulkhan Singh had revised the standard operating procedure for police personnel. 
 
 The policemen cannot attend complaint of illegal mining without roping in an administrative officer which was not done in the case.
