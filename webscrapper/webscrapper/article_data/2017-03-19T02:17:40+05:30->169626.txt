GHAZIABAD: A number of residents of   residential society in   are worried about the legality of the ownership of their flats as their apartment details are not included in the list put up by the   on its official website.

 Speaking to TOI, residents of the unlisted flats said they were worried about the future of their residential property as it was not in the GDAâ€™s official records. They said they were apprehensive about their ownership being questioned in the future. The root cause of the problem is the builder having divided bigger flats into smaller ones after the society came up.
 
 However,   clarified that the builder was responsible for the flats not being listed on the website and that residents need not fear any legal issues stemming from the situation.
 
 The main problem being faced by the 136 residents is that their flats being missing from the website was not allowing the society RWA election to be held as the guidelines of the UP Apartment Act demand that the number of resident votes in a society adhering to the Act be decided based on the size of the flats. The provision allows larger flats to have more votes. Till 2013, the society had been conducting the RWA election on the basis of one vote per flat. 
 
 When asked, Dayanand Prasad, officer on special duty of GDA, said the flats were not illegally built by the builder and did not violate the original plans of the society.
 
 Prasad said the problem arose as the builder had divided larger flat units into smaller units and sold them separately.
