MUMBAI: A month after the budget session, which was marked by sloganeering and boycott by opposition seeking  , pressure is building on CM   to convene a special session of the legislature to discuss the agrarian crisis. 

 A delegation of   met Fadnavis, while a delegation of opposition parties led by the leader of the opposition in the assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil knocked at the doors of Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao to press for their demand for a special session.
 
 Vikhe Patil told the governor that since the government had failed to stop farmer suicides, a loan waiver was the only way to tackle the situation. "We informed the Governor that while 3,052 farmers committed suicide last year, as many as 639 farmers have ended their lives between January 1 and March 31, 2017. Under such circumstances, a loan waiver is the only option," Vikhe Patil said.
 
 Pointing out the problems faced by tur dal farmers, he said, "In the absence of planning and vision, farmers have had to sell tur dal at a nominal price. Fadnavis should announce a special bonus for tur dal producers. In view of the agrarian crisis, Fadnavis should waive the power bills of farmers."
 
 Vikhe also took a dig at Shiv Sena and said, "During the budget session, we boycotted the proceedings to demand a   waiver, bu the Sena was participating in the proceedings. Now, suddenly it has woken up after the Congress and the NCP decided to meet the Governor."
 
 Fadnavis has been non-committal despite all the pressure. When opposition members had raised the issue during the budget session, he had first said a loan waiver was not the most effective of ways to tackle the agrarian problem. Later, he said a decision would be taken at an appropriate time. When the newly elected Uttar Pradesh government announced a loan waiver for farmers, it was expected that Fadnavis too follow suit, but no such decision was taken.
