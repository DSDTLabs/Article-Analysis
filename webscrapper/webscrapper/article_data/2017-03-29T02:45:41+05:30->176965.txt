It’s understandable that he will prefer Cooch Behar more than the other north Bengal districts,” Banerjee said, replying to Maynaguri MLA Ananta Deb Adhikary.
 
 Banerjee instructed Deb to expedite the Gajoldoba tourism project, which recently got a nod from the court. “It is our dream project. The court has lifted the injunction. I would like Goutam to look into the matter personally and ensure that work on it resumes at the earliest,” she said.
