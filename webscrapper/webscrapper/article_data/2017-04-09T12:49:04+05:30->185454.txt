KANPUR: A day after the birth of tiger cubs in  , the zoo administration is now waiting for lioness Nandini to litter cubs in the next two or three days. It will be a moment of extreme joy for the zoo administration as in a span of one week the zoo will also have cubs of lioness. 

 On Friday afternoon, the tigress had littered four cubs but their number could be confirmed only on Saturday. The zoo authorities are monitoring activities and the health of the tigress and its cubs through CCTV cameras. The zoo vets are expecting that lioness Nandini would too litter four cubs. 
 
 Zoo vet Dr RK Singh informed that lioness Nandini which was mated with lion Ajay is likely to litter cubs either on Sunday or Monday. "It is expected that it will litter four cubs. Nandini and Ajay were brought to Kanpur zoo from Raipur zoo in December last year. The lioness is being monitored through CCTV cameras", said Dr Singh while talking to TOI.
 
 With the birth of cubs, the number of lions are set to increase because at present there is only a single lion pair in Kanpur zoo. Lions come under Schedule-I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and are therefore endangered specie of wild animals. 
 
 According to Kanpur zoo records, lion Vishnu and lioness Lakshmi were shifted to Lion Safari in   in 2014 where both of them later died one after the other. Kanpur zoo authorities had brought a lion pair (Nandini and Ajay) from Raipur in December, 2016. 
 
 Talking about the number of cubs born to tigress Trusha on Friday, Dr Singh said that CCTV footage confirmed that it had littered four cubs of which two are relatively weak. He said that the tigress is being given chicken, vitamins and other supplements as she is now a lactating mother.
