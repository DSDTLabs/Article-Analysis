NAGPUR: Schools in Vidarbha coming under the purview of the Right to Education (RTE) Act have been given time till February 3 to register on the   online portal. Schools which fail to register before Friday midnight, will find their recognition terminated by the appropriate directors of education (primary) of the district.

 The decision was made during a meeting at the office of the deputy director of education, Nagpur at Morris College T-Point. The meeting was convened under the chairmanship of deputy director Anil Pardhi and administrative officer   along with special presence of chairman of the NGO RTE action committee Shahid Sharif. Education officers from six districts in the region were also present.
 
 A revised age criteria for admitting children to STD I was made clear. Children aged between 5 years and 4 months and 6 years, 11 months and 29 days and whose day of birth falls before 30 September will be eligible for admission. Previously, July 30 was set as the cut-off for admissions and the definition of age was not as precise, according to Pardhi.
 
 Sharif urged the officers from the districts to make arrangements to fill vacant seats reserved under RTE. However, no specific data was available at the time.
 
 Increasing the income limit criteria to Rs. 2.5 lakhs from the current Rs. 1 lakh was recommended in the meeting. “Parents are not truthful in disclosing their income on the RTE form. It is better to raise the limit,” said Sharif.
 
 The recommendation tabled in the meeting will be submitted to the state and national advisory councils under the RTE act, said Sharif.
