BENGALURU: Three men have been arrested on the charges of murdering a cab driver on March 18. The trio had also attempted to kidnap another cabbie on April 1, said police.

 The accused,  , 26, his relative  , 36, from   and  , 22, from Odisha, are all residents of Konena Agrahara and worked with private firms, said   police.
 
  
  
 Indicating that their intention to rob , if not murder the cab driver, may have been planned, police said the gang had tried stopping at least three other cabs before the victim, S Rinson, 23, agreed to ferry them to   in Tamil Nadu.
 
 Police said the gang was aware that their information — phone number and location — would easily be available to police if they booked a cab using mobile apps. Hence, they had decided to hail a taxi.
 
 “They were standing near   in DJ Halli. Other cab drivers had refused to take them as they had not booked the rides using mobile apps. Rinson, however, agreed to take them to Hosur for a price of Rs 1,500,” police commissioner T   said.
 
 The men then directed Rinson to drive through the Anekal industrial area, where one of them requested to stop the vehicle claiming he needed to relieve himself. “As soon as the car stopped, they smothered Rinson to death and drove to   forest where they dumped his body,” police said.
 
 The gang then fled with the sedan worth about Rs 11 lakh and two mobile phones belonging to Rinson. Police, who acted on a missing complaint filed by Soman — Rinson’s father — a resident of  , tracked down the trio through the stolen phones. “Based on the tower location, we started looking for Rinson near Anekal. Last week, the accused started using the victim’s mobile and it became easier for us to trace them,” police said.
