ITANAGAR: The All   Students' Union (Aapsu) has sought the attention of state and central governments to the alleged Chinese incursion in   sector in   district of the state.   demanded more proactive response from the government as an assurance for indigenous people that they are not vulnerable.

 Chinese road construction personnel had allegedly intruded almost one kilometre into the Indian territory at Upper Siang in late December. They had, however, retreated after being stopped by Indian troops, who seized their two excavators and other equipment.
 
 The apex students' body in a statement said that incursions by China clearly undermined India's sovereignty. They also alleged that the mute response and repeated downplaying of such serious developments by New Delhi reflects its ambiguity on the issue. The vexed issue of stapled visa is a glaring example whereby the people of Arunachal Pradesh have been deprived by the Centre, the statement added.
