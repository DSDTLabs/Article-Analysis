SHIMLA:  , co-accused in the   and murder case, was cremated amid heavy police security in Shimla on Wednesday. 

 His wife Mamta is still not ready to believe that Suraj, a native of Nepal, was involved in the crime. “How would I manage with two kids with my husband gone forever?” she said while interacting with media persons before the last rites of her husband.
 
 She claimed that Suraj was not a criminal. “I don’t know how my husband died inside the police lock up but now ensuring better future for my children is a challenge for me,” she said.
 
 Suraj Singh (29) was arrested on July 13 along with five others in connection with the gangrape and murder of a minor girl in   area of Shimla district on July 4.
 
 On the night of July 18, Suraj was allegedly killed inside the police lock up by Rajender Singh alleged to be the main accused. Postmortem examination was conducted at Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital but his body was preserved for re-examination by a CBI team. After conducting the post-mortem examination again on Tuesday, the CBI had handed over the body to Suraj’s family.
 
 As immediate help to the family, the Nepalese community in the area collected some money for Mamta, who is currently lodged at Nariniketan at Mashobra. For the last around four years, Suraj was working as a farm labourer at Halaila village in Kotkhai area. 
 
 The community is peeved on the custodial death and earlier they had refused to perform the last rites as family members of Suraj in Nepal and his brother in Gujarat had not informed about his death. They agreed only when the Shimla SDM persuaded them to cremate the body lying in the mortuary for the last one week.
