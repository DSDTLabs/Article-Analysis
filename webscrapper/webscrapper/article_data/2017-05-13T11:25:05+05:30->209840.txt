LUCKNOW: This financial year, there will be smaller flats on offer by   ( ). The board is anyway struggling to sell its inventory, a large part of which comprises the self-financed category in which a flat cost between Rs 35 and Rs 55 lakh.

 The board has over 15,000 unsold flats of which 7,000 are in Lucknow alone. In an internal survey, UPHDB found that most of its flats were beyond the common man’s purchasing power. So it has decided to cut down on the cost of construction and provide smaller flats, of around 60 square metre area, to people of   (lower income group) and EWS (economically weaker section) and a decision to this effect has been taken at UPHDB’s board meeting. 
 
 UPHDB’s additional housing commissioner   said, “In 2017-18, our focus will be on constructing flats in the range of Rs 12- 20 lakh. We have to bring down the construction cost to make flats accessible to the common man. The cost can be brought down by cutting on flat’s super area and also by using better technology which can give better construction in lesser time.” It has also shelled out about 15% more funds for development of projects.
