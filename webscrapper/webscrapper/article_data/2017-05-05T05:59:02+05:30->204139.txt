CHENNAI: A 23-year-old   himself dead at the   base at Tambaramon  

 Police, who identified the deceased man as   of   in Uttar Pradesh, said he was on patrol duty when all of a sudden he turned his service automatic rife on himself. His colleagues in the patrol team rushed to his side and found on the ground, bleeding from the temple.
 
 Senior officials at the IAF base alerted police who arrived and moved the body to the Chromepet government hospital for postmortem. The Selaiyur police registered a case. The incident occurred at 8 pm.
 
 Police said Gulbir, who joined the IAF in Assam four years ago and was posted to the city six months ago, had left no suicide note. Investigators are checking the call record details from his mobile phone to ascertain the possible cause for the suicide.
 
 After the postmortem was complete, police on Thursday handed over the body to IAF officers at the base. The incident has left most of the deceased airmanâ€™s colleagues in a shock. Some of them were asked to give statement to police on whether he had appeared depressed or whether they knew if he had any domestic issues back home.
 
 No details were available from the IAF about the suicide. When contacted, the defence public relations officer refused to divulge any information. He termed it a minor incident and said that no official would be able to comment on the death or the reasons behind it.
