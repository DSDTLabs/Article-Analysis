FRISHOLT ( ):   is expanding its network with the aim of doubling revenue to Rs 1,000 crore in the next four years, betting big on an innovative ‘Made in India’ solar pump for rural areas and intelligent pumping solutions for civic bodies, water-intensive industries and building segments.

 
 “We closed 2017 with a turnover of Rs 500 crore. We see Rs 1,000 crore turnover as per Indian GAAP in four years,”   India head   said recently. He said the 200 points of sale and service facilities are being set up to widen reach in the market.
 
 Apart from the locally-developed solar pump, Grundfos is using energy efficient, IT-enabled offerings from its Danish parent’s portfolio as differentiators in the Indian market that is dominated by low-cost products, often of suspect quality and efficiency.
 
 Grundfos has identified the Indian subsidiary’s IT wing as a ‘centre of excellence’ for collaborating in development of electronic brain for pumps and modules for their remote operations, including through mobile apps or home computers, through an internet of things-based platform.
 
 These ‘e-pumps’ are a “testimony to Grundfos’ commitment to sustainability and energy efficient solutions… and expected to drive global sales growth,” according to Grundfos senior director — digital offerings,  .
 
 The intelligent pumps with sensors allow civic bodies and water treatment plants to modulate pumping operations in tune with the changing demand instead of running machines at full capacity even when not required.
 
 The government’s smart city drive and river cleaning programmes, entailing efficient water distribution networks and sewage treatment plants etc, present big scope for intelligent pumping solutions from the Grundfos stable. The solar pump is bound to find large application takers as the government moves to replace some eight million irrigation pumps running on diesel.
