BATHINDA: Accusing the Punjab State Cooperative Agriculture Development   ( ) of forcibly taking blank cheques from farmers while advancing farm loans, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) on Monday held protests outside the bank’s branches in various districts.

 BKU activists asked the bank authorities not to collect blank cheques from farmers as those were used to approach courts in case of default on payments. The activists alleged that when cheques get dishonoured, the bank gets arrest warrants of farmers from courts, which was against the promise of state government.
 
 Two farmers of Rampura area in   were arrested after their cheques were dishonoured and courts sentenced them to one year imprisonment each.
 
 “Small farmers are not in a position to repay farm loans. But banks, in the name of making recovery of money, are harassing them. We are forced to stage protests and have decided to lay siege to the bank officials if they go to villages for recoveries from farmers who are unable to repay their loans,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) vice-president Jhanda Singh Jethuke.
 
 Outfit’s general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said even though the state government had claimed that no small farmer, who was unable to repay loan would be arrested or his land wouldn’t be auctioned, the banks were harassing them. “We have come across such harassment of farmers in Bathinda, Mansa, Moga and some other districts,” he said.
 
 PADB assistant general manager Harcharan Singh denied any harassment of small farmers, saying: “The bank collects post dated cheques in a legal way. Bank is adopting legal measures only for recovery of the loan money.”
