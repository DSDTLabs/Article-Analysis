NEW DELHI Former   chief   indicated to the party that she would continue as head of the Congress parliamentary party even as she declared   her "boss". 

 "He is now my boss too. Let there be no doubt about that, and I know that all of you will work with him with the same dedication, loyalty and enthusiasm as you did with me," Sonia, who spent 19 years as Congress chief, said. 
 
  Part y leaders see a significant message in Sonia telling party MPs, "As for myself, as chairperson of Congress parliamentary party (CPP), I will work with the Congress president and other colleagues in discussions with like-minded parties to ensure that in the next election,   is defeated and India is restored to a democratic, inclusive, secular, tolerant and economically progressive path." 
 
  This could mean Sonia continues in the important position of CPP chairperson, which will allow her to play a role in interacting with allies and other opposition parties. She will also be able to address CPP and deliver guidance and elaborate on the party line, something Rahul could also be expected to do. 
 
  Sonia continues to function as   chair and she called a meeting last week of leaders of 17 non-NDA parties to push for opposition unity on issues of national importance both inside and outside   in order to oppose BJP. This was the first time she led an opposition meeting after handing over the baton to Rahul.
