PATNA: After Madhubani railway station’s complete makeover last year, the entire   heartland will now be decked up in various hues and shades of Madhubani painting. 

 The Madhubani district administration has planned to beautify the walls of government buildings as well as houses in the villages of the district in order to promote the Mithila art.
 
 Madhubani DM   said the circuit house has already been adorned with beautiful paintings depicting scenes from Ramayana and seven resolves of chief minister   along with other social issues.
 
 Around 200 houses at   village have also been painted in the Mithila style. “Jitwarpur is famous for producing best artisans. Since many local artists are in the trade of Madhubani painting, I suggested them to get their homes painted to attract the attention of tourists. It will also help artists to showcase their talent to the visitors”, the DM said.
 
 Recently, the upcoming administrative building of Khajauli block was also painted along with a Vivah Bhawan at   village in   block of the district.
 
 The administration’s next project is the Madhubani district collectorate. “I was surprised when I came to know that the artisans had memorised the entire art form. The beauty of Mithila artwork cannot be ignored. I thought of tapping it to strengthen the economy of the region and attract tourists”, Shirsat said.
 
 Around 7,000sqft area of Madhubani railway station decked with the local art form has become a major attraction. Many local artists were roped in for this project, which was taken up by the East Central Railway on October 2 last year as part of ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’. The artists contributed without charging anything. However, the raw material was provided to them by the administration.
