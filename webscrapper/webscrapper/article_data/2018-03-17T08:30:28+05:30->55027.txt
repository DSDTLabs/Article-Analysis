CHENNAI: A day after the publication of a TOI report “Four   owe TN   Rs 3.29 crore”, the   Endowments contested the demand of   made by Tamil Nadu Wakf Board. The endowment has been wrongly listed as “the top defaulter” and also wrongly mentioned that it owes the Wakf Board Rs 44 lakh, said its agent U Mohamed Khalilullah.

 Khalilullah said the Wakf Board had wrongly announced that the Prince of Arcot Endowments was listed as “the top defaulter” and had not paid Rs 44 lakh as arrears of 7% contribution to the board. He said the contribution to the Board had been rightly paid till March 31, 2017 in respect of Trichy and Chennai income, and there were no arrears at all.
 
 “The contribution for 2017-18 is payable only after April 2018. The Wakf Board is wrongly demanding the contribution on   donation, for which they are not at all entitled to and we have informed the board earlier, on many occasions, that we will not pay it,” he said.
 
 The Wakf Board has overlooked the provisions of Section 72 of the Central Wakf Act, which is emphatic that donations to corpus fund are outside the purview and no contribution is payable on the same.
 
 In response to the denial, a senior accounts officer of the board told TOI: “We have carefully calculated the 7% it should pay. We have not included the corpus donations they have received.”
 
 “Our accounts show the endowment in Trichy had an arrear of Rs 1.7 lakh and the one in Chennai has an arrear of Rs 18.63 lakh. The current year outstanding is Rs 13.21 lakh in Trichy and Rs 11.02 lakh in Chennai. The total outstanding is Rs 44.74 lakh. We have communicated this clearly to them. We have also sent them reminders asking them to pay,” he said.
