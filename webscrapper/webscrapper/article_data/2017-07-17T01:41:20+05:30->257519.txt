PATNA: The crisis within the ruling   in Bihar deepened on Sunday with RJD chief   making a veiled attack on Bihar chief minister   for not supporting Meira Kumar, the opposition’s nominee in   on Monday.

 “Jo confusion me rahta hai woh bar bar dhokha khata hai (Those who are confused get betrayed again and again),” said Lalu.
 
 Though Lalu did not take Nitish’s name, he made it amply clear that the jibe was aimed at him. While addressing a meeting of RJD and Congress MLAs convened ahead of Monday’s polling, he attacked the CM for his decision to back NDA’s presidential choice Ram Nath Kovind. “An important part of the   (JD-U) will be voting for the BJP presidential candidate tomorrow,” he said, adding that people of Bihar are politically aware and cannot be fooled easily.
 
 Lalu, who was accompanied by his minister sons Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav, said the Mahagatbandhan was formed to fight the fascist and communal forces and to cut the BJP’s roots in Bihar. Hence, his party was firm on the ideology it followed, he said. Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh said it was high time all the opposition parties remained united or else the country would slip into the hands of communal forces. “Not only tomorrow, we have to remain united even in future,” he said.
 
 Earlier, Bihar Congress president and education minister Ashok Choudhary met Lalu twice at his residence. Sources in the party said Choudhary, at the behest of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, was trying to broker peace between Lalu and Nitish.
 
 Congress leader Awadhesh Singh said both Nitish and Lalu should sit together and resolve the issue as both of them had worked hard to stop the BJP from coming to power in Bihar. “We have seen that whoever dares challenge the BJP is harassed. It is important to remain together. Warna Bihar ka bhagwakaran ho jayega (Or else, Bihar will be saffronised),” he said.
