LUCKNOW: Even as Unnao police are exploring legal options on whether or not rape charges will be invoked against  's Bangarmau MLA  , in an application before a local court in February, the rape survivor had declared herself a minor. 

 This declaration, made by the mother of the survivor on her behalf, implies that if rape charges are invoked against Sengar, he can be booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, which draws punishment from minimum three years to life imprisonment.
 
 The girl has shown her date of birth as 17 August, 2002 in the application. In the same application, the girl has claimed the incident took place on June 4, 2017 at 8pm when a neighourhood woman lured her into offering a job and instead took her to Sengar.
 
 "When my daughter protested, Sengar threatened my daughter that the disclosure on this would lead to killing of her family," the petition said.
 
 It makes further description of how the alleged rape took place.
 
  "The woman is equally involved in this crime. She was present in the balcony when the rape took place," the application adds. 
 
 "When my daughter returned home and told us of the incident, we sent letters to several police officials but no one took cognisance due to pressure from the MLA. It is requested that action may be taken against both (the woman) and the MLA," the application states.
 
  has so far maintained that the original complaint by the Unnao girl was received on June 11 last year on charges of abduction against three other men-Naresh Tiwari, Shubham Singh and Brajesh Yadav.
 
 In this case, UP Police has submitted a court challan with charges of POCSO against the three .
 
 However, the police claim that no charge of rape against Sengar was received either in the original complaint or a statement recorded before the magistrate.
