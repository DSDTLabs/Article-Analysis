AHMEDABAD/NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host his ‘friend' --   and wife Sara — in his   on Wednesday. The Israeli PM will be the   to be hosted in Ahmedabad in a span of over three years ever since Modi became PM in May 2014. Modi hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping on his birthday on September 17, 2014, followed by Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe on September 13 last year.

 On Tuesday, Netanyahu along with his wife Sara visited the Taj Mahal. Later, he inaugurated the third edition of the geo-political conference, 'Raisina Dialogue', where he said that the threat of radical Islam and its terrorist offshoots can “upset” the international system and batted for stronger ties between India and Israel to overcome the challenge. Netanyahu hailed India as Israel's “natural friend and partner”, drawing a wide smile from Modi, who was in the audience.
 
 In Ahmedabad, the two leaders will hold a roadshow from the airport to Sabarmati Ashram and then go to Bavla for a visit to iCreate, the innovation and incubation centre. Both the PMs will then fly to Vadraj village near Prantij to visit the Indo-Israel Center for Excellence on Vegetables. They will also digitally inaugurate the Centre for Excellence for Dates in Kutch. Netanyahu will present Modi a special gift - the Gal-Mobile water desalinisation and purification jeep the two leaders rode on Israel's Olga beach last year.
