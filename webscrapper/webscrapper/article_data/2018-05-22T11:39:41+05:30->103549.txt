CHENNAI: A recent order by   to introduce a fee of Rs 350 per month as entry fee for outsiders to use the railway stadium in   has not gone down well among railway employees, sportspersons and local residents, who were using the facility for free for many decades.

 
 Based on petition by locals, DMK working president   has written to the   RK Kulshreshta requesting to reconsider the decision. “Since senior citizens and youngsters are using it for daily walk and exercise for betterment of health, I request the authorities to kindly consider the grievance positively,” Stalin’s letter received at the GM’s office on May 7 states. This was based on a petition given by the walkers club of Perambur to Stalin.
 
 The application form given by the Southern Railway Sports Association ( ) also demands a copy of the Aadhar card, a passport size photograph and a disclaimer that violation of conditions would result in disqualification.
 
 Employee unions like Dakshin Railway Employees Union (DREU) and Southern Railway Employee Sangh (SRES) have protested the decision saying it impacts the railway sportspersons and common men training under the railway coaches.
 
 “The stadium does not have proper facilities. The toilet door is kept locked by certain people. Even railway sportspersons are not allowed to run when certain influential retired employees practice cricket or walk in the stadium,” said A Janakiraman, former DREU president.
 
 A few sportspersons said the equipment in the gym is more than 30 years old and rusting while the boxing ring in the stadium is in a poor condition. “Demanding a fee for such poor facilities is uncalled for,” a sportsman said.
 
 SRSA secretary   defended the decision, stating the fee was imposed to control the entry of non-railway people. “Only outsiders will be charged the amount. The stadium will be free for railway employees. This has been implemented in other places like Madurai as well,” he said.
