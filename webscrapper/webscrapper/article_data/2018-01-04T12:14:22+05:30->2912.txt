LUCKNOW: Lucknow airport and city streets will get a facelift soon as part of preparations for the UP Investors’ Summit being held in the state capital on February 21-22. The state government has directed   ( ) to refurbish the airport by adding more greenery, landscaping and a smoother approach road.

 The LMC has also been directed to improve the parking system which has gone haywire because of ongoing   construction.
 
 The orders were issued by urban development department principal secretary Manoj Kumar Singh after he inspected the airport, surrounding areas and Kanpur Road.
 
 He said, “Our airport’s condition is not up to the mark and is severely lagging in comparison to the ones in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. It needs a lot of redecoration as we are hosting a grand event. So I have asked LMC to add more greenery around airport, smoothen the approach road to the airport and streamline parking system so that it leaves a good impression to the summit invitees and guests on their arrival.”
 
 Singh has directed LMC to do landscaping along the 900 metre stretch from Kanpur Road to the airport.
 
 The department also sanctioned Rs 15 crore to LMC through state finance commission funds on Monday to carry out beautification, plantation and repairing of roads. LMC will be smoothening the roads from airport to Hazratganj, Gomtinagar and VIP Road ahead of the summit.
 
 The roundabouts will also be decked up. All crossings between airport and Gomtinagar will see plantations before January 31. Singh said, “Guests will also visit tourist spots like Imambara, Residency and Bhul Bhulaiya. LMC has to ensure good roads as well as cleanliness during the summit.”
