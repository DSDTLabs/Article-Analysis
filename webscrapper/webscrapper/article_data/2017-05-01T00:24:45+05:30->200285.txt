Pune: Around 125km of roads have been dug up across Pune till Sunday for various civic works and other projects.

 Private telecom operators and government agencies like Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) dug up roads to lay cables and pipelines.
 
 As per the schedule set by the Pune Municipal Corporation, the digging phase of the project was to complete by April 30 and all roads are to be repaired by May 31. No work will be allowed between June and September, except in an emergency. Fresh permissions will be granted from October 1.
 
 “After the  , the civic administration has stopped giving permission to contractors for road digging. Permissions to dig around 200km long route were sought by different companies. Out of that 125km has been dug up,” said Rajendra Raut, head of PMC’s road department.
 
 He added that the civic body has requested these contractors to use new techniques, such as the trenchless method, but a majority did not pay any heed to such appeals. 
 
 The roads were dug up to facilitate various projects like piped gas supply, Internet and telephone connections. Roads were also dug up for water, sewage, and stormwater lines, and electrical works. The city has 2,200km of roads in all.
 
 The MNGL is already supplying piped gas to around 40,000 homes in Pune, and also operates over 40 CNG refilling stations. It has plans to expand the services to about 60,000 more houses in the days to come. 
 
 Vishwas Sahastrabuddhe, a member of the citizens’ group ‘Sajag Nagrik Manch’, said the deadline remains only on paper, as roads are being dug up even later. “There is a lack of coordination between the agency which grants permission to dig, and the contractors who dig the roads,” he said. 
 
 As per PMC officials, the civic body charges Rs5,500 per running metre from private firms to dig roads, while government agencies pay Rs2,100 per running metre.
