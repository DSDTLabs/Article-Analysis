Coimbatore: A 26-year-old man was arrested for murdering his brother-in-law over a family dispute at Thaavaipalayam near Kottur on the outskirts of the city on Wednesday. The deceased was identified as K Krishnan, 32, of Palaiyur near Samathur in Pollachi. “He was a labourer. He had married Hemalatha 12 years ago and the couple has two sons. Four years ago, Krishnan developed an extra-marital affair with a 23-year-old woman, who had separated from her husband. Though he married the woman a year ago, Krishnan was staying with his first wife. He used to visit his second wife’s house at Thaavaipalayam near Kottur. His second wife used to pester him to say with her permanently. However, Krishnan refused to do so and they used to fight over the situation often,” a police officer said. The second wife’s elder brother P Mahendran, a labourer from Thaavaipalayam, had warned Krishnan not to disturb his sister. “However, Krishnan often fought with the woman. On Tuesday evening, Mahendran assaulted Krishnan using a sickle at his residence. Krishnan suffered grievous injuries on his head, nose, eyes and was rushed to the government hospital in Pollachi. He was later shifted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. But, he died without responding to the treatment on Wednesday,” the officer added. Kottur police registered a case and arrested Mahendran. He was remanded in judicial custody.
