VISAKHAPATNAM: Nagaraju  , 20, a poor tribal boy from  , would run against the wind in the dirt roads of   village in   district hoping to be a marathon champ one day. 

 On Saturday, he braved blizzards in the mighty icy heights above the Everest base camp, walked over frozen bodies to finally climb his way to the top of the world. 
 
 And what sets him apart is that he's just not one of the youngest to conquer Everest, but also he reached the summit from the perilous northern   side. Nagaraju, one of the six youth from Andhra Pradesh in the first Indian team this season, is the son of a daily wage earner. 
 
 A short while after he returned to base camp, Nagaraju told TOI from China, "I am happy to scale the mountain from Tibet side. This was an enthralling experience. I was thrilled to be standing on the highest peak. I will next attempt to conquer Everest from the Nepal south end."
