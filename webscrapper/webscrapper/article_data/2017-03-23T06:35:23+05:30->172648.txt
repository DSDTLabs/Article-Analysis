VADODARA: The Anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) was granted two more days of custody to interrogate   (CA)  , who was trapped on Sunday evening at Dahod while accepting a bribe. Agrawal along with income tax (I-T) officer Dinesh   and an unidentified man had accepted bribe from a person on whom a search was conducted by the I-T department recently.

 Agrawal was presented in a Dahod court after his two-day remand ended on Wednesday. The ACB sought Agrawalâ€™s custody for two more days as it still needed to collect evidence and locate Meena as well as the unidentified person.
 
 Sources said that Agrawal was also taken to the   at   for a voice spectrography test. The test was conducted as his voice along with the other accused had been recorded during the trap laid after a complaint by a petrol pump owner  .
 
 The accused had sought a bribe of Rs 65lakh to ensure that he was not harassed in connection with the I-T search on him. Agrawal had paid Rs seven lakh earlier and had gone to pay another amount of Rs eight lakh, but only after filing a complaint with the ACB that had laid a trap to nab the accused. Meena and his aide escaped during the raid after accepting Rs 8 lakh.
