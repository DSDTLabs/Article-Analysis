PANAJI: With coke, heroin, ecstasy,   disappearing from   along with the sun and shine, it is the   that is in demand during the off season. Most synthetic drugs as well as other narcotics like coke and heroin which come into circulation during the peak tourist season come from abroad.

 But during monsoon, with foreign footfalls at a minimum, the supply of these drugs also dry up forcing the addicts to switch over to ganja to remain high.
 
 Umesh Gaonkar, SP of anti-narcotics cell, said addicts who find it difficult to source their usual hard drugs, satiate their cravings with ganja. 
 
 “Ganja is not grown in Goa. It mostly comes from neighbouring states of Karnataka and Kerala, and also from Odisha,” Gaonkar said.
 
 On Friday, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a raid in Panaji, seized 14kg ganja worth Rs 7 lakh and arrested three men from Odisha and a juvenile. Two days before that, Vasco police in a raid had also arrested a man from Odisha with 4kg ganja. The person was found to be operating from a hut located close to the airport.
 
 A common thread in both cases is the involvement of people from Odisha and that they worked as labourers. Gaonkar said during the past three-four years, they have found involvement of migrant labourers dealing in drugs.
 
 “They bring narcotics in gunny bags and travel by rail. This makes it difficult to trace them,” Gaonkar said.
 
 But a senior police officer said it is unlikely that the migrants were acting on their own. “Do you think a small time labourer can put in lakhs to purchase and narcotics without any help? It is highly impossible. If it is a small quantity, I can understand,” he said.
 
 A narcotics bureau officer said the latest seizure clearly indicates that ganja is gaining popularity on the streets of Goa.
 
 In fact, recently, Calangute MLA and deputy speaker Michael Lobo said many boys and girls in his constituency do drugs.
