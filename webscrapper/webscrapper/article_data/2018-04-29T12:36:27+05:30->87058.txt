She spoke about the efforts she had put into the melancholic love ballad. Now that she has seen that the song is there in the film, Iman can heave a sigh of relief. While on Drishtikone, Nispal Singh, producer, was so jubilant about his house’s 50th film that he hosted its first premiere ever. Even Ghare and Baire, which starred wife  , did not have a premiere and here, he was making an exception. It’s good to see him come out of the shadows of others.   will help him clear his vision.
