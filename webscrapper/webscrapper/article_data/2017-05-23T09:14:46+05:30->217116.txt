PUNE: Conservation experts on Monday called for a central repository to track biological data of variety of indigenous flora in Pune. They were speaking at an event to mark the International Day for Biological Diversity.

 Society for   vice-president   told TOI: “There is a large variety of indigenous wild plant species which have no scientific records or nomenclature as they have solely been consumed and conserved by local forest communities. Some of these plant species bear fruits that even carry health benefits and hence need to be scientifically documented”.
 
 These indigenous wild species have so far been conserved in their isolated natural environment, and not studied. “We now need to build a gene-bank in a central location so that all these species are properly studied and detailed,” he said.
 
 He was speaking on the sidelines of a biodiversity-themed event at Empress Botanical Garden. Apart from an exhibit and tasting of these local fruits, there were various other events, including a heritage tree walk,   hunt, display of medicinal plants varieties, as well as a film screening on the biodiversity of the Western Ghats.
