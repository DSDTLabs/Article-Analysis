BHAGALPUR/PATNA:   Arijit   filed an   petition on Monday, two days after a Bhagalpur court issued a warrant of arrest against him for allegedly fomenting communal tension at Nathnagar in the district on March 17.

 An FIR in connection with the Nathnagar incident was lodged against Arijit and others on March 19. On March 24, the court of Bhagalpur CJM Anjani Kumar Srivastava issued arrest warrants against Arijit and eight others on an application filed by police. The bail petition was filed by Arijit’s lawyer before the Bhagalpur district and sessions judge. 
 
 Talking to reporters in Patna on Monday morning, Arijit refuted the allegations against him and accused police of protecting the real culprits and falsely implicating him. “I am not a culprit and, therefore, not hiding. I have moved an anticipatory bail petition,” he said. 
 
 Arijit accused the Nathnagar police station SHO and DSP of lodging the FIR at Bhagalpur MLA (Congress’s Ajit Sharma)’s behest. “They have pitted two communities against each other. A section of a particular community hurled bombs, shot at policemen and physically abused women, but they have not been caught yet,” said Arijit who unsuccessfully contested the assembly election on BJP ticket from Bhagalpur in 2015.
 
 He said the BJP would fight against the ‘fake charges’. “Why shall I surrender? I am in court’s shelter,” Arijit said.
 
 Arijit’s father called the FIR a “piece of garbage”. “The FIR is nothing but a piece of garbage, registered by corrupt officers of the area. My son made no mistake,” minister Choubey told reporters.
 
 Former CM and RJD vice-president Rabri Devi, on the other hand, alleged Arijit was being protected by the state government. “Law and order has collapsed in  . Criminals are not being arrested; women are being harassed; murder and kidnapping are the order of the day,” she said.
