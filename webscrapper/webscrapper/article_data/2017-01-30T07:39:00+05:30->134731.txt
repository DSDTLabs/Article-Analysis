KOTKAPURA:   tried to woo the farming community by listing the welfare schemes launched by the NDA government in its two-and-a-half year term. He also attempted to project Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch Parkash Singh Badal as the biggest sympathizer of farmers.

 Equating Badal with late Prime Minister   and former deputy Prime Minister Chaudhary Devi Lal, who were called the champions of peasants’ causes, he called Badal as the flag bearer for the causes of farmers in Punjab. Modi also termed Badal as a highly-tolerant person who never loses his cool, even when the opposition parties indulge in mudslinging.
 
 He said that his government at the Centre was working to double the income of farmers by year 2022. The PM also stressed on the need to save water repeating his slogan of ‘Per Drop More Crop’. Without commenting on the contentious SYL issue, Modi strongly advocated the necessity of water for farming and avowed to provide water to villages situated at the tail ends of streams.
 
 “We know that if the Punjab farmer gets adequate supply of water he can grow gold on his farm. We are promoting micro-irrigation under per drop more crop initiative and 15 lakh hectare land has already been covered under it. We are also for value addition for farmers with which farmer can earn up to $1 with value addition in various segments where now farmer is earning Rs 1,” Modi said.
 
 He said the Congress has produced no big farmer leader of the stature of Badal and due to Badal, Akali Dal was called ‘Kisano ka dal’. He accused opposition parties of using derogatory words for Badal. He asked Sukhbir and Harsimrat not to expect good words from such leaders who don’t know the limits of decency.
