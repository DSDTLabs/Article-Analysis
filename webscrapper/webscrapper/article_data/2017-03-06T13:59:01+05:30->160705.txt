Every parent has the fear of traveling with kids, especially the smaller lot. Unexpected situations and   hazards make it worst so here are some tips to make travelling   easier.

 
 Weekends and long holidays will typically find the locations crowded so avoid these. So whether you are travelling by road, taking the bus or train or the flight, it will be less crowded if you travel during week days. You can also choose off season locations and research on things to do at those places during those times.
 
 
 Smart packing solves most of your problems. Carry important medicines if your child has particular allergies and is prone to fall ill. Keep dry snacks handy when you may find yourself far away from a restaurant at meal times. Take their favourite books, music and videos to keep them engaged.
 
 
 Wear a small sling bag which can hold all your IDs and important documents so that you don’t have to hold the baby while rummaging through your bag. Carry your child’s birth certificate or passport, if he or she has one, along for plane flights, and read and research the airline’s policies on children traveling.
 
 
 Keeping the kids minds occupied all the mind is most important so play games. Word games, music games or just singing aloud, all these helps keeping things happy and positive.
 
 
 Kids are an impatient bunch so break the journey and enjoy the ride. Keep a map handy and identify restaurants and parks on the route in advance where you can halt for a breather. Kid friendly restrooms are also of utmost importance.
