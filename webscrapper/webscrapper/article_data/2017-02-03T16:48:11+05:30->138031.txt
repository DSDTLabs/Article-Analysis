THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Girl students of the Holy Angels Convent on Thursday took to streets in Nanthancodu area of  's Thiruvananthapuram district. They were demanding the shutdown of a government-run liquor shop which was opened in their neighbourhood as part of a relocation programme. 

 On Thursday morning, the girl students accompanied by teachers, came out in force demanding the immediate closure of the Kerala State Beverages Corporation ( ) shop. Such was the strength of the protest that the   authorities posted a notice on the shop saying it should not function until further orders. 
 
 It was only after K Muraleedharan MLA and poet Sugathakumari joined the protesting students at the venue and extended support for the campaign, the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation secretary arrived at the spot and posted the notice.
 
 In December, last year, the Supreme Court banned the sale of liquor within 500 metres on either side of national and state highways across the country, forcing around 300 such outlets comprising beer and wine parlours, five star hotels and state-owned liquor retail outlets to look for new places, as they must move out latest by the beginning of the new fiscal.
 
 In Kerala, liquor is currently served only in about 30 five star hotels and around 600 beer and wine parlours; it is sold through 334 state-owned retail outlets.
