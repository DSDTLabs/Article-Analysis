HYDERABAD: Since the city   centre was introduced in 2016, the She Team has recorded over 3,000   cases. While police admit to the rising number of cases, they say that nearly 60% of them are actually registered because the woman suspects her partner’s fidelity or because of an internal dispute.

 
 
  
 
 
 “The number of domestic violence cases is high, however, not all the cases are severe in nature. Most of the cases are of the internal dispute among the couple. Most of the women who approach us complain about husbands being alcoholic and not giving enough   for home and children,” said assistant commissioner of police (She Team), D  .
 
 “Women also approach the police station suspecting their husbands of having an affair. They ask the police to give their husbands a warning. Such cases we refer to counsellors. Nearly 60% of the cases are of marital disputes or affairs,” said women police station inspector Madhavi Latha.
