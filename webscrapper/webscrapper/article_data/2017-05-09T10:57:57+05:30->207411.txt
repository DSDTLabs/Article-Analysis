KOLKATA: The Bengal BJP has demanded a   (NIA) probe into Sunday's blast at the Trinamool party office in East Burdwan's Aushgram.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh raised the demand, taking a cue from the   incident, after the state police reached the spot late. Ghosh said the nature of the blast didn't rule out the involvement of terrorists from  , prompting local Trinamool leaders to cry foul over Ghosh's plea for “Central interference in state matters“, something the party has been hinting at for quite some days.

 Ghosh, however, is well within his rights to demand the NIA investigation because the agency can probe matters relating to terrorist activities, counterfeit currency or organised violence without taking special permission from state governments. Anticipating the Trinamool ruckus against the Centre's “interference“, the state BJP president has put pressure on chief secretary Ba sudeb Bannerjee, pointing to the “tirades against BJP“ made by none other than chief minister   in administrative meetings that “brought disgrace to the Prime Minister's office“.
 
 Calling this a “breach of work ethics of administrative services“, the state BJP leader, in his letter to the chief secretary , wanted to know why he allowed this to continue for days. Ghosh also wanted to know why the IAS and IPS officers present in the meeting didn't leave as a mark of protest against the “blatant political attack against the PM“.
 
 Ghosh then made a pointed allegation against the chief secretary .“You are not supposed to join a politically motivated gathering and become a participant of diatribes against the PM,“ Ghosh wrote.
