Vadodara: Eyebrows are being raised over approval of purchase of 18 air-conditioners (ACs) by a department of M S University without mention of brand name.  It has come to light that the Department of Textile Engineering of MSU’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering had recently moved two proposals to approve purchase of 18 two ton split ACs worth Rs 8.70 lakh.  While the department itself has not disclosed the brand names of the ACs purchased by it, the proposals got approved last month not only by the accounts department but also by the office of registrar, the purchase committee and the finance and establishment committee even as none of them took cognizance of the fact that the purchase statement does not mention the brand name.  “This is surely a procedural lapse as there are four layers to keep a check on the purchase. While the department itself should have made a mention about the brand name in its purchase statement, at other levels too it should have been verified. Such lapses should not occur in a publicly funded institute,” said government nominated syndicate member Dr Ashok Mehta.  Mehta said that he has time and again demanded that proper procedures be followed for purchase. “Also, we have given suggestion that there should be two parallel deadstock registers – one which is maintained at department or institute level and another which is maintained centrally at university level,” he said.
