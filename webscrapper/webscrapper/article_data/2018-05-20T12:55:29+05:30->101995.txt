JAIPUR: A group of Class X students of an elite school in Jaipur are toiling hard in a village identifying possible areas of digital intervention to make life of villagers a bit easier. Bracing 43 degrees Celsius temperature, these minors are conducting door-to-door survey of households to provide them digital training like making online payments, checking weather,   maps, using government services through apps etc. 

 Neither they are interning with any government agency nor are they working on a school project. They are experiencing social work, which is required for applying for scholarships abroad. 
 
 Most of the Ivy League universities look for social work experience while offering scholarships in crores. “I spent a week in the village and realized that they (villagers) work very hard even for petty things like applying for a new water/power connection. Internet has reached the village but the use is very limited. Our team has shortlisted 53 services - both government and private - which are essential and giving demonstration on how to use them through a smartphone,” said   (name changed), of a private school, which has requested not to quote student's real names. All these five students will apply for higher education in the US.
