NAVI MUMBAI: For the past four months residents of   11, 13, 14, 19, 20 and 21 in   have had to deal with a number of civic problems. Bad roads, mounting garbage with no regular collection, irregular water supply and a pond filled with dumped  . Few days ago residents brought their problems to the notice of civic authorities.

 “Even a   located between Sectors 18 and 19 has been filled up with illegal debris dumping. We have brought this to the notice of the authorities a number of times, but nothing has been done,” said local corporator Netra Kiran Patil.
 
 Fed up with the indifference, residents from a number of societies collectively met those concerned and demanded that action be taken. CIDCO Chief Engineer K K Varkhedar said that following the issue of the pond he will look into the correct land use of that plot. “We have been instructed to review the use and rectify the problem as soon as possible,” he said. The other problems will also be sorted out, he added.
 
 While bad roads may be a regular feature, the area is now dotted with piles of garbage. “This is because there is no regular collection and there needs to be more public bins all over,” said Bharat Kondhalkar, a resident of Sector 20.
 
 Residents also say that many societies do not receive a regular water supply. “Supply is low, we hope it gets be normalised soon,” added Netra.
