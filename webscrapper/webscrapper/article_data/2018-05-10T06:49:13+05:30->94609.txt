PUNE: Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) has found 300 unregistered projects that are under development without sanctioned approvals in Pune and Mumbai region.

 
  
 
 Even after following up repeatedly with the projects’ developers, they have refused to register. MahaRERA authorities have written to the respective collectors and municipal commissioners in Pune and Mumbai to initiate action against them.
 
 “We have written letters regarding 92 projects of the nearly 300 projects that have been reported to us through information and after verification. The respective local authority, in this case the collectors or the municipal commissioners to take necessary action against the projects,” MahaRERA secretary   told TOI.
 
 He said they will tell the local authorities to check the sanctions of these 300 projects and has urged action against them under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act (MRTP Act).
 
 MahaRERA has received over 9,000 emails giving details of such projects. Of these, 7,000 emails were found to be valid and the total number of projects that were reported through these emails were about 700, Prabhu told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 A follow-up of these complaints found that 245 projects were exempted while 79 projects were registered and remaining would register shortly.
 
 According to the regulation, all projects that have not received occupation certificate and are being sold or marketed must be registered with the authority. 
 
 Of all the state regulators, MahaRERA has achieved the highest number of registrations, about 16,000 projects, of a total 27,000 registered across the country, so far.
 
 The recent directive of the government also plans to bring tenanted or cessed buildings and tenants of such buildings under the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), providing for the first time the same protection to these consumers as those available to other home buyers.
