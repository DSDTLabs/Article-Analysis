 Ershad had come to power in a coup in March 1982 as chief martial law administrator and became president in December 1983. Officials felt he had been charged in fabricated cases and the high court exonerated him of the graft charges. Thus, the trial court verdict was scrapped along with pleas by the state seeking stricter penalties against Ershad.
 
 There were 42 cases lodged against   after his ouster in a mass movement. He has already served six years in jail.
