GURUGRAM: Effects of the western disturbances that brought sudden rain and relief across the NCR last week seem to have faded away, paving the way for mercury to shoot up again.

 On Tuesday, the maximum temperature rose to 38.3 degrees Celsius, almost nine notches more than what was recorded on Monday.
 
  Similarly, the minimum temperature was 23.3 degrees Celsius in the day, as against 21.8 a day earlier. On Monday, rain and thunderstorm had lashed Gurugram and other parts of NCR, bringing down the temperatures significantly. Met officials said that the mercury would return to the 40(plus) region again Wednesday onwards. “Though   conditions remained in the comfortable zone on Tuesday, we are heading towards sweltering days again. But, the temperature won’t go as high as 45-46, at least in the next few days,” an IMD official said.
 
 “We aren’t expecting any weather activity for the next 3-4 days,” said  , a senior official at the IMD centre.
 
 Another senior Met official claimed the city skies would remain party cloudy on Wednesday and Thursday. The situation may change again from Friday onwards. There are chances of some disturbances on Friday and Saturday with weathermen forecasting possibilities of thunderstorm. “Also, there are possibilities of dust storm on Sunday, and rainfall next Monday, which will bring down the temperature slightly once again,” said the Met official. 
 
 The concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was recorded at 143.45 µg/m3 while the air quality index (AQI) was reported to be 200 (categorised as ‘unhealthy’) in Gurugram on Tuesday. 
 
 Though the PM2.5 concentration was higher than 60µg/m3 mark (considerable safe), the pollution level was much less than what was recorded last week. Officials claimed apart from the showers on Monday, brisk winds, sweeping across the city for the past couple of days, too played a role in keeping the air pollution in check.
