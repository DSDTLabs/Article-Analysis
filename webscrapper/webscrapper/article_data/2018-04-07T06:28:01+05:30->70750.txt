LUCKNOW: Missing IIM-Lucknow student   could not be traced, police have told the high court.

 Lucknow police stated their conclusion in a reply to the high court after two months of searching for Das. The court had issued an order to search for the missing IIM student on January 29.
 
 Das, a 26-year-old secondyear PGP student, had gone missing from the IIM campus on July 18, 2017. He was last seen coming out of a hotel in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh on July 21.
 
 The parents of the missing man had met the Union home minister on September 25, demanding a CBI investigation into the matter. They later filed a petition in the high court, asking for a CBI probe.
 
 SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar, in a verbal reply to the court, said that police tried to search for the IIM student in Kulu, Kasol, and other districts of Himachal Pradesh and also sent a team to the house of Das’s wife   in   but were unable to trace him.
 
 Now, the court has given 10 days to the police to give a documented response of the investigation they conducted. The response should also specify the method adopted by the police in carrying out the search operation. The next hearing of the case is scheduled for April 24.
 
 Senior lawyer  , the counsel for Das, said that Lucknow police were only using traditional means to search for the man. According to her, police personnel who were sent to search for him did not even have smartphones.
 
 She said police officers were seen with a photograph of Das and asking villagers about his whereabouts. She also stressed that Das had taken an exam on the day he went missing. “If Subhadip had to go out in such a way, why would he have taken the exam,” she said.
