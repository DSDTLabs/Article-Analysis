NEW DELHI: From next month, commuters travelling by an   or a   in Delhi will be able to get all details about the driver on their mobile phone. They will just have to scan a   pasted on the headrest of the driver’s seat using Delhi Police’s Himmat Plus mobile application.

 “We have now made it mandatory for all autos and taxis to have QR codes. Commuters will get all information about the driver, including their photograph, name, address and public service vehicle badge number,” said a transport department official after a   meeting on Friday.
 
 The QR code has been made a permit condition, and auto and taxi drivers have been given a month to get the code, he added. 
 
 The department believes the move will go a long way in ensuring the safety of commuters, especially women. “From the photo, commuters will be able to find out if the driver is the person in whose name the vehicle is registered,” the official said. Commuters will also be able to share details received from the QR code with their family or friends, which will help them track the vehicle. 
 
 The registration number of every vehicle will also have to be prominently displayed on the rear side of the driver’s seat. “By having the number displayed inside the vehicle, commuters will be able to note it down if required,” the official said.
