MOHALI: The   (ED) on Thursday conducted searches at the premises of its former deputy director and others in connection with a money laundering probe in Rs 600-crore ‘ponzi’ scheme scam.

 The ED officials said the houses of its former officer  , advocate Puneet Sharma in Judges and Officers Enclave, Sector 77, Ramesh Chandel in Omega City Kharar and another person in Chandigarh and Mohali were raided under provisions of the Prevention of the Money Laundering Act ( ).
 
 Gurnam Singh has been the investigating officer of the ‘ponzi’ case and was relieved from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) last year in January. Officials claimed that Gurnam Singh, the former deputy director of the ED’s Chandigarh zone, has allegedly taken bribes to the tune of about Rs 4-6 crore in purported connivance with Sharma. The raids have been launched to gather more evidence in this context, they said. ED director Karnal Singh had issued stern directives that instances of corruption in the organisation will not be tolerated.
 
 The agency had conducted multiple searches in this case last year and it had also arrested the absconding agent,  , of the alleged chit fund firm.
 
 The case, the ED had said, pertains to thousands of investors who were "systematically lured and cheated to the tune of more than Rs 600 crore by floating ponzi or pyramid schemes assuring exorbitant returns.”
 
 It had said that the alleged “mastermind” of the scheme is a Malaysian identified as Mugundhan Gangam who floated two firms –– Ms Unipay 2U Marketing Private Limited and Unigateway2U Trading Private Limited –– in India. “When thousands of people across the country invested crores of rupees in the said ‘ponzi’ schemes, the companies stopped the payouts or monthly returns (since October, 2010) and gradually siphoned off crores of rupees of investors,” it had said.
