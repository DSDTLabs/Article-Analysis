SHIMLA: While approving the annual plan of Rs 6,300 crore for 2018-19 in the meeting of state planning board, chief minister   said "there is a need to do something different". 

 He said they must do away with the past practice of laying down and approving annual plan as a routine. "We have to work for the development of those sectors that hardly find a mention anywhere. Norms should be eased for private players in vital sectors, such as tourism, youth services and sports and hydel generation, among others," he added. 
 
 "Can we improve and strengthen the existing set up? The need of the hour is to give fillip and identify such sectors in which we can excel or compete with other states. Though   is doing its best in many sectors, a lot more could be achieved," he said.
 
 He said everybody will have to think out of the box for achieving the unachieved and undertaking the development never witnessed before. He directed the officials to come out with 13 to 15 new schemes in the  .
