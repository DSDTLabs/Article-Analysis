Maharashtra Board had 41.8% OBC who cracked JEE Advanced. National boards like CBSE and ISC had 31% and 26% share of OBC students. 

 The high percentage of OBC students, said experts, is a sign that IITs are no more the reserve of educated elite and are witnessing a significant class shift. Among 1.7 lakh bright students who took the IIT JEE (Advanced) on Sunday, there were 37% OBC candidates, which was almost same as 40% open category students who tried their luck to make the cut for IITs. Qualifying score for backward candidates is 49 while for open category students it is 81.
 
 In UP, 9% general category students qualified for JEE (Advanced), only after Tamil Nadu which saw merely 3% open category students appearing for JEE (Advanced). Rajasthan stands third with 11% open category students as as against 43.5% OBC students taking the (JEE Advanced) test. In UP Board, while 269 from general category qualified for JEE Advanced, 1,710 from OBC category and 949 SC candidates appeared for the test. 
 
 Similar is the case with Tamil Nadu and Kerala where a larger chunk of   and the SCs have qualified for the IIT test through their school boards. Even in case of the Gujarat, Telangana, Andhra, Karnataka, Kerala and West Bengal state boards, a larger number of OBC students is competing for IIT seats vis-a-vis those from the open category.
 
 Higher OBCs, said officials, means there would be higher number of OBCs qualifying under the general category and not taking a quota seat.
