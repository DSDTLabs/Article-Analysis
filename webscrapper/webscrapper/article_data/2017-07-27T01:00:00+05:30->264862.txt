CHHAPRA: With a view to minimizing road accidents, the Saran district administration has decided to ban use of   while riding motorcycles.

 A couple of months back, use of helmet was made compulsory while riding bikes. Sources said offenders would be fined. Penalty for not wearing helmet will be Rs 100 for the first two times. Being caught for the third time will lead to a fine of Rs 200. Saran SP Anusuiya R Sahu has recently issued instructions to the traffic police and different police stations to organize frequent checking of vehicles and impose fine on violators.
 
 Saran district transport officer (DTO) Jai Prakash Narayan has also directed the officials for frequent checking of vehicles and ask for pollution under control certificates from motorists. They have also been asked to educate people for not using pressure horns.
 
 The transport department is also intensifying a drive to penalise vehicles with fancy or faulty number plates. Faulty plates are those that don’t adhere to the colour, size and space specifications, while fancy number plates are those that have unusual fonts or stylish depictions of numerals.
 
 “While many vehicles have plates in which the numerals and letters are not as per the prescribed size, others have fancy number plates with pictures of politicians, actors or other symbols. We will remove such number plates and the vehicle owners are asked to get new ones,” said DTO office sources.
