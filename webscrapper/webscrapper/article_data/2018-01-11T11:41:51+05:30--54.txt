Pune: "Religion is a private business. Nationalism creates narrow-mindedness. Think about humanity and welfare." This was the message spiritual guru the Dalai   gave on Wednesday. 

 He was in the city to inaugurate the second national teachers' congress organised by   at   in Pune.
 
 He spoke about the need to revive India's ancient learning. "In the 21st century, education is key but it should include moral teaching, how to deal with emotions rather than make children materialistic," he said.
 
 On the Koregaon Bhima clash, the spiritual leader said, " Whatever religion one follows, it is a personal matter. We should not mobilise or create groups and tag anybody as we Buddhists, we Muslims or we Hindus."
 
 He called on academicians to make sure that with scientific education, children are taught compassion, honesty and how to forgive. "We are humans and we need to remember this. Buddha also teaches that reason and experiment are more important than blind faith," the Dalai Lama added.
 
 He advocated the cause of global well-being and urged people not to limit their views to national boundaries. " Too much of nationalism is also creating problems. We must think about nation as a contribution for making world a better place. We have to promote oneness," he added. Calling India a complicated, new yet old nation which is the most populated democracy, he spoke about how, despite various religions, it has been a country known for tolerance. "I am an 83-year-old man. My generation is over. It is your generation and hence your responsibility to create a happy, peaceful world," he said.
 
 The Dalai Lama spoke about how there is emotional crises in the world, and India, with its tradition of ahimsa (non-violence) and knowledge can show the world the path.
