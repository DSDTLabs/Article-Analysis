Sunday will see one-act play  , from Marathi writer Ratnakar Matkari’s collection  , being staged at Bal Gandharva 
Rangmandir at 10 am. If you think you’re ‘hushar’ (smart) enough, join in the jamboree! 
 
 The play is directed by actress   of   fame. Radhika, who loves introducing children to the joys of theatre, says, “I performed many of Matkari’s plays in my childhood. His plays feature among the few exceptional scripts available for children: Beautifully capturing their psychology through his young protagonists.” 
 
 Hushar Mulanche Natak is the story of eight-year-old Shankya, who hails from a village that can’t read or write. When he learns to read, pride gets the better of him, until he meets a Vasudev, folk artistes known to travel across villages enacting stories of Krishna through song and dance. “Matkari’s works always highlight ‘Dushtancha Naash, aani Sajjanancha Vijay’ (the destruction of evil, and the victory of good), and this play has a wonderful lesson as well,” adds Radhika.

 The play, that features 17 kids between seven and 14 years of age, is a culmination of eight months of learning and work. Many of them didn’t know what drama was, before. “We worked on different forms of expression: Use of voice, emotion and body language,” Radhika shares, adding that there’s a noticeable transformation in all of them today. 
 
 Matkari is considered one of the few who can delve into the innocent, yet deep perspective of a child. Of the 98-odd works that he has penned, many of them give children’s drama its due — this play being one of them for sure. Sunday will hence be a good chance to bring out the child in you, and head for a true bacha party!
