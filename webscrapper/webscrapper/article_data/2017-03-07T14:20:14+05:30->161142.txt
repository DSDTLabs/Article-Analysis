KARNAL:   of Sagga village in Karnal district left their homes for Karnal on Monday, claiming threat to their lives. A dispute had erupted in the village between Rajputs and Dalits some days back, when a Dalit youth rode a horse chariot and played DJ on his marriage. 

 The dispute had taken an ugly turn, with heated exchanges between the two groups giving way to stone-pelting. Some policemen were also injured in the fight between the two communities. Karnal deputy commissioner   and SP   had reached the spot to resolve the issue.
 
 On March 4 and 5, the government officials and some villagers had tried to broker peace. However, the parleys failed to allay the fears of Dalits, who packed their bags and left for Karnal on Monday. In Karnal, they assembled at   before they were summoned for a meeting with the DC.
 
 A Dalit woman,  , alleged that they were being harassed by the upper caste villagers. “Some Rajput boys even danced naked in front of us. They have been torturing us by stopping supply of water, milk and other basic necessities,” she said.
 
 Karnal SDM   said the administration was working to convince members of both the communities “to maintain peace and harmony in the village”.
