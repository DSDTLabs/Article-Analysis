BENGALURU: The high court on Wednesday directed issuance of a show-cause notice to  , a Delhi-based lawyer, for what it termed "making attempts to interfere with the administration of justice". 

 The court noted that during last week's hearing on the legality of the legislation about 85% pictorial warnings on tobacco packs, Khosla alleged that hearing in these cases was not fair and resorted to shouting in the court. He was appearing for Rahul Joshi who has a PIL before the Rajashthan high court. 
 
 The case was referred to   in May last year following an apex court directive.
 
 A division bench comprising Justices B S Patil and B V Nagarathna gave this direction seeking response of Deepak Khosla as to why action under criminal contempt should not be initiated against him by March 21, 2016. The hearing on the PIL will, however, continue on Thursday.
 
 According to the court, Khosla argued in an intimidating and aggressive manner, and used 'nasty and intemperate' language, claiming that the  , which had transferred the case, lacked jurisdiction and the order was illegitimate. Later despite the grant of time, he failed to appear, instead sent a written synopsis through another advocate, seeking deferment of the proceedings. He also sent emails to the judges making allegations against tobacco companies, saying they would damage the high court's reputation .
 
 As regards  , a Bengaluru-based advocate who also appeared in the case and sent a letter to the Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court (which was also marked to the CJI), the court reserved the option of taking action against him if the need arises.
