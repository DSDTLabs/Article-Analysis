IDUKKI: The revenue officials on Tuesday evicted encroachments from 13 acres of land at   in  . The government plans to distribute the land to tribals as part of a rehabilitation project. 

  During the eviction drive, the revenue officials demolished an illegally constructed building and gate. Later the officials posted a 'government-owned land' board there.
 
  Revenue officials said the land was encroached by   several years ago. As per the Chinnakkanal village office records, the land was included in survey number 82/1. In 1977, the revenue department handed over the land to the forest department to cultivate eucalyptus trees. Later, the revenue department reclaimed the land for a tribal rehabilitation programme.

  "We will continue the encroachment eviction drive in the coming days," said Udumbanchola tehsildar.
