MARGAO: Benaulim MLA  , in a letter to Union minister for shipping, road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, has requested him to withdraw the ‘minimum educational qualification’ condition required to obtain a continuous discharge certificate (CDC), a seafarer’s identity document.

 Seamen seeking CDCs now have to compulsorily clear their secondary school certificate (SSC) examination, a rule that Alemao said would affect close to 80% of Goans working on board ships.
 
 “People who had joined ships earlier had also applied (voluntarily) for continuous discharge certificates, but there was no minimum qualification condition then. Lately, however, continuous discharge certificates have been made compulsory for all those working on ships, or else no person will be allowed to join,” Alemao said in his letter to Gadkari.
 
 The lone NCP legislator said he would personally hand over the letter to the Union minister. 
 
 A delegation of the Goa Forward Party also met Gadkari over the issue.
