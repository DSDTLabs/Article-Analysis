INDORE: Supply of green vegetables has dropped by over 25 per cent in city markets. A sharp decline in arrivals of vegetables from nearby centers has lifted  . 

 
 According to dealers of Choithram market, increase in temperature and higher transportation cost has squeezed supplies of vegetables in the market. 
 
 During the beginning of summer months, supplies from Maharashtra and Gujarat had kept vegetable prices calm but with rising temperature and increase in transportation damage arrivals from outstation markets have almost dried up. 
 
 Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Harisabzi Vayapari president Mohan Singh Goud said, “Arrivals have dropped by over 25 per cent for past one week.   are not brining vegetables in the market. We are exploring alternatives to get vegetables.”
 
  wholesale market gets most of the green vegetables from Nimar, Mandleshwar and nearby areas. Vegetable dealers said production of green vegetables drops sharply in summers due to harsh weather and lack of water. 
 
 Goud said, “The shelf life of vegetables especially leafy ones drop sharply in summers leading to early damage. Also green vegetables cannot be stored for long.”
 
 Besides increase in cost of transportation has also hit supplies from outstations. 
 
 Anand Choudhary, a vegetable seller said, “Vegetables from outstation markets have also dropped. Farmers have to pay more in transportation these days due to increased cost.”
 
 Vegetable dealers said increase in the prices of petrol and diesel has escalated the cost of transportation. 
 
 According to dealers, prices of vegetables may increase further in coming weeks as most of the supplies will come from cold storages. 
 
 Choudhary said, “As fresh supplies have dwindled, now the dependency will grow more on cold storage supplies. These vegetables will be more expensive than the ones coming from nearby farms.”
