Mangaluru: The sad state of an anganawadi centre compelled its alumni   Kavitha Sanil visit the school on Wednesday and direct the authorities concerned to take up the matter on priority.

 A section of the media had reported that the school where Kavitha studied had no  . The school, Vaidyanatheshwari Anganawadi, situated near the Kavoor Circle, is one among the first four anganwadis in the district, built around 1984. Thirty four years on, the school still doesn’t have a toilet.
 
 The centre now has 30 students-18 boys and 12 girls. While most of them relieve themselves in the open, the anganawadi teacher Srimati takes some of them to their houses provided the houses are in the vicinity.
 
 To make things worse, the kids have to cross a road every time they feel the urge to attend the nature’s call. The locals fear that the kids face a risk of a mishap every time they cross the road as vehicles keep plying on the road.
 
 The centre did not have power supply either. It is only last year that K G Jagadeesha, the then DC, facilitated electricity to the centre after requests were placed.
 
 Interestingly, teacher Srimati, who currently takes care of the kids, is also the one who taught the mayor two-and-a-half decades ago.
 
 Kavitha told TOI that she has promised her teacher that work will start within two days. “It does not come under the   limits. The issue comes under the department of social welfare. However, we have taken the responsibility to construct a toilet. I wasn’t aware of the situation of this school till date,” she said.
