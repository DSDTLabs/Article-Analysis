 has often been seen riding a horse at a popular club in Southern Mumbai. But against popular perception, it’s not for a movie. The actress has been indulging in the activity purely as a hobby that helps her rejuvenate post work. “I love horse-riding. I used to do it when we lived in  . After I moved to Sri Lanka and subsequently to Mumbai, I couldn’t pursue it much. Over the last few months, I’ve been making time to visit a club and practice it,” says Jacqueline, adding, “Whenever I am in Mumbai, and I have the time, I wake up at 5 am, and I’m atop a horse at 6 am. I spend a couple of hours; it’s therapeutic. It’s a hobby I’ve cultivated outside of work. Everything we learn cannot be work-related, right? And look at the brighter side, I’ll be prepared if a role comes by where I need to horse ride.”
The actress headed home for Christmas celebrations and has now joined her gang of girls in   to kick off 2017 in style. Once she returns to the bay, she will start the concluding schedule of her action adventure with   Malhotra. Jacqueline says, “There’s not much left to do. We have a song and a host of scenes to do. We’ll be done this month. As for the action scenes, they’re limited for my character although I do have some interesting things to do. Sidharth’s character is completely driven by action.”
