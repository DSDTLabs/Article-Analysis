 While Yadav was already in custody, the SC had directed that Lalge and Gambhire be taken into custody if they do not surrender within a week. Both men surrendered and were present before Justice Mridula Bhatkar on Friday for the hearing. 
 
 Lawyers Abhijeet Desai and Debajyoti Talukdar, appearing for Yadav and Lalge, submitted that the duo should be released on interim bail [on humanitarian grounds] as they appeared before the court and have not committed any crime when they were out on bail
 
 Additional public prosecutor Y M Nakhwa, however, sought time to secure instructions from the investigating agency and submitted that the investigating officer was not available for deliberation. 
 
 Justice Bhatkar referred to the Supreme Court order and said, “The orders of this court are set aside by the Supreme Court and, therefore, the earlier position is required to be restored.” The bench referred to a paragraph in the apex court order which stated that Lalge and Gambhire be taken into custody if they do not surrender within a week. “So also, the high court is directed to hear the matter afresh and decide the bail applications within six weeks.”
 
 Lalge and Gambhire shall be lodged in Arthur Road jail in Mumbai. Posting the matter for hearing next on February 23, the bench said the three applicants can file affidavits through their next friend/relative, if they want to, on or before February 21.
