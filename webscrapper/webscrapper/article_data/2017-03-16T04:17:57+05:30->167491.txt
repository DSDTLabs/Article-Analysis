NAVI MUMBAI: Following the incident of a nine-year-old school boy’s death due to a speeding bus after he got off his  , an activist working for child rights has written to the   suggesting safety measures for children travelling by school bus.

 Varsha Rokade, a   resident, who is an expert with the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said, “In my letter I have suggested that the pick up and drop points for   should be fixed and sign boards should be displayed at those places. At these points, white stripes like that of zebra-crossing should be drawn to facilitating pedestrians. The school authorities should regularly make the bus drivers aware about safety measures to be taken. Also, schools should make arrangements for schoolchildren to travel and implement safety guidelines as per the Supreme Court directives.”
 
 She added that a traffic cop should be appointed on the junction of the main road near the school to ensure that other vehicles do not speed and halt while schoolchildren cross the road. 
 
 “As far as possible, the routes to ply school buses should be less congested and main roads should be avoided,” she added.
