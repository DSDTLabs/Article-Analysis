NEW DELHI: Delhi high court ordered an assessment of Delhi Metro’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the event of someone going   from its stations, to see if these were being actually implemented.

 The direction for an audit of the SOPs was given by a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and P S Teji to a court-appointed committee, which was set up in July 2017 to frame guidelines to prevent incidents of   going missing while travelling on the metro.
 
 The committee was set up after a mentally-challenged 19- year-old woman went missing from a metro station on April 21 last year while travelling with her family.
 
 As per the petitioners, the woman failed to get down at Jahangirpuri metro station with her family and according to the CCTV camera footage of the next station, she was seen exiting the station after ‘tailgating’ another passenger.
 
 After going missing for nearly three months, she was found wandering in Rewari district of Haryana by a policeman, who took her to a child welfare committee.
 
 The order for an assessment of the SOPs was given after advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for Delhi Police, said that while procedures say that the exit gates have to be manned, it was not being done due to shortage of   personnel.
 
 The reserve police force told the court that it has written to the central government asking for more manpower and its requisition was under consideration. It said that the exit gates were being manned by private guards at the moment. High court then asked the committee to file a report after assessing the implementation of the SOPs.
 
 The bench listed the matter for hearing on February 12.
