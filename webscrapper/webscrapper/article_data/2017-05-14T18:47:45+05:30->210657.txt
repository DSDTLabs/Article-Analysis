PANAJI: The directorate of health services hardly receives complaints under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994, that prohibits determination and disclosure of the sex of the foetus.

 At the state level seminar held on Sunday, focussed on the above legislation, the directorate appealed to the public, including doctors, to send complaints, even if they are anonymous, against those seeking and carrying out   in the state. The directorate has even launched a new email ID set up for the purpose.
 
 “The declining sex ratio since 2014 is definitely a concern for a small state like Goa,” said Dr  , chief medical officer, family welfare, directorate of health services. She added that there will be more frequent inspections and stringent monitoring carried out.
 
 Awareness about the law is key, said advocate Pallavi Mulgaonkar, legal assistant for the state PCPNDT cell, after elaborating on the provisions of the legislation. A clinic with equipment capable of detecting the sex of a foetus must be registered under the act, she said, adding that incase of illegal sex determination, everyone from a registered medical practitioner to a family member, except a pregnant woman, can be booked under the act. 
 
 Clearing misunderstandings about the PCPNDT and the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, Dhume said these were two different acts that required medical practitioners and those running clinics to register separately under each of them. Centres performing   must register with medical superintendents of the respective district hospital and those under the PCPNDT Act must get their ultrasound clinics registered with the respective district collector.
