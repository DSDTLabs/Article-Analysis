NEW DELHI: Defending its probe against Arvind Kejriwal’s former principal secretary  , who has levelled allegations against the agency, CBI has claimed “strong, irrefutable evidence on corruption racket” run by the official. 

 “A chargesheet has been filed against Kumar in the court on the basis of solid evidence. The probe was carried out for over a year before he was charged,” said a CBI officer.
 
 On Kumar’s allegations that FIR was registered against him in December 2015 on the basis of frivolous allegations and without verification, the CBI officer said, “CBI follows all legal procedure before filing a case against somebody or arresting him/her. Every complaint received, irrespective of who the complainant is, is properly examined, verified and then any action is taken”.
 
 The allegations levelled by Kumar that he was threatened by CBI officers are “baseless”, which are coming now when he has been chargesheeted, said the officer. 
 
 Kumar was arrested on July 4 while the agency filed a chargesheet against him last month. CBI has charged Kumar, a 1989-batch IAS officer, along with eight other people and his front company—Endeavour Systems Private Limited (ESPL)—with allegedly running a ‘systematic’ information technology-related corruption scandal worth Rs 57 crore for nearly nine years from 2007 to 2015 in which he and his accomplices received a bribe of Rs 3.3 crore. It has claimed that Kumar’s alleged corruption cost the exchequer Rs 12 crore.
 
 “The charges against Kumar are based on material and technical evidence, enough to prosecute him,” said the officer. Kumar’s voice samples, email conversations and audio clips recovered from his computers are part of evidence.
