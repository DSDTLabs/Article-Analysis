HYDERABAD: Two research scholars from Osmania University have filed a public interest litigation in the AP and   high court, urging it to direct central authorities to bring back the 105th Indian Science   to Hyderabad and hold it as per the original schedule, from January 3 to 7, at the   campus. 

 In their plea, the two scholars, Somagani Kiran Kumar and Pasupula  , blamed the Telangana chief secretary, the home secretary, the DGP and Hyderabad police commissioner for the shift of venue to Manipur. 
 
 In “wrong reports... these authorities described the OU campus as unsafe”, they said.
