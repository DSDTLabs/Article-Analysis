NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of   on Thursday asked the Maharashtra government to come clean on the reasons for the   in state being reduced despite centre providing it in sufficient quantity.

 A division bench comprising justice   and justice Indira Jain directed the government to file a reply within a week. 
 
 The court was hearing a PIL filed by Gadchiroli villager   through counsel  , alleging discrimination in allotment of   quota for rural areas.
 
 Earlier, Mirza pointed out that even though the centre provided 3 litre per person every month to the state, the latter reduced it to 2 litre per month.
 
 He informed that the state failed to pick up its quota, which led to reduction in supply from the Central government. In turn, the state government gets cashincentive in purchase of kerosene.
 
 The petitioner contended that though requirement of kerosene is more in rural areas, the quota fixed by government is two litres per beneficiary per month in comparison to four litres in urban households, and of late, it was reduced to 470ml. 
 
 Following this, the high court granted interim stay to the governmentâ€™s existing kerosene distribution policy on July 1, 2015, terming it as arbitrary and irrational.
