ERODE: A group of weavers here stopped production on Saturday to register their protest against the goods and services tax (GST).

 “We cannot follow the GST regime as our business involve various steps,” said M  , one of the protesters. “GST would add not less than 25% tax on our products against the existing 0%,” he told TOI. 
 
 Weavers from Salem, Namakkal and Erode districts had held a one day fast and three-day strike since June against GST. “Around 2,000 weaving units at Sivagiri, Thandampalayam, Kollamkoil and   district have stopped production as part of the protest,” a protester said. They threatened to intensify agitation if they were not exempted from GST.
