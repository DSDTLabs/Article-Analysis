Gandhinagar: Congress MLA from Rajkot, Indranil Rajyaguru, challenged the BJP government in assembly to act against bootleggers who are freely operating in Rajkot city.

 During the discussion on the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, Rajyaguru said that rules should be implemented properly. “Recently the Gujarat assembly passed more stringent norms on liquor consumption, but even after this law there are three bootleggers in Rajkot who are openly operating their liquor and gambling dens,” said Rajyaguru, adding, “These include Payalbhai in Ghanteshwar area, Ramaben in Jangleshwar and Kiritbhai in Hadala.”
 
 “I call upon the government to take action and get these liquor and gambling clubs closed,” said Rajyaguru, pointing out, “This is the town from where the chief minister is elected.”
