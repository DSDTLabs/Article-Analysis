MUMBAI: The   has directed the economic offences wing (EOW) of the city police to file a reply on a petition by a Khar-based garment owner who claimed to have been cheated by a builder who sold him a basement in his building based on forged documents.

 The   has demolished the illegal portions of the shop and will initiate action over the unauthorized construction carried out in the basement. The EOW has already registered a case against Ankur Developers and is probing the allegations. Nimesh Dalal of Ankur Developers declined to comment.
 
 Vandana Creations, owned by Nanji Faria, had paid Rs 24 crore for a ground-plus-basement shop of area 12,544 sq ft in Rajdoot Building on Linking Road, Khar (west). Faria entered into a tripartite agreement with Ankur Developers and an investor who had bought the premises in 2011. According to Faria’s complaint, the builder produced forged documents showing that the ground floor shop had a basement with a total area of 12,544 sq ft.
 
 Meanwhile, a builder’s representative said Faria was aware about the “illegalities” at the time of the purchase. “After four years, he is crying foul,” he said. But he had no explanation when asked why the plan submitted at the registration office showed the area sold to Faria as 12,544 sq ft when the actual legally usable area was 3,357 sq ft.
 
 Faria obtained a trade licence to start his garment business. In 2013, Vandana Creations received a demolition notice from the BMC, which stated that only 3,357 sqft was legal.
