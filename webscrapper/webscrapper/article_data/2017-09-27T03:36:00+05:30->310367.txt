Panaji: The draft of the people’s charter for tourism, prepared in consultation with various tourism stakeholders, from lifeguards and taxi drivers to small guesthouse owners and entertainers, highlighting their demands and expectations from tourism, will be released on World Tourism Day on September 27. The effects of tourism on women and children also form part of the charter. The draft, coordinated by the Centre for Responsible Tourism, will then be taken to villages for deliberation, following which it will be shared with the government. Stakeholders were not happy with the tourism master plan that the government outsourced to a company and have shared their thoughts in this draft, sources said. The release coincides with the tenth anniversary of the centre, an initiative by the Archdiocese of Goa to humanize tourism.  An inter-collegiate debate competition for students of travel and tourism on the people’s charter for tourism and tourism master plan will be held . A photo contest will also be held on the theme ‘Goa, we do now know’. tnn
