Chennai: Against the backdrop of the   ‘season’ and a drought, the state health department has instructed officials to step up surveillance of dengue,   flu, hepatitis, leptospirosis and typhoid.

 With water being in short supply and people being likely to resort to drinking from sources that may be contaminated, health secretary J Radhakrishnan at a meeting on Friday instructed officials to fan out across the state to ensure water samples are tested routinely and breeding grounds for mosquitoes are cleared. “We also need to constantly monitor water sources,” he said. Deans of medical colleges, joint directors of public health and health inspectors from the districts were among those who attended the meeting.
 
 The public health department has identified Chennai’s outskirts, Tirupur, Tiruvallur, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Coimbatore and Madurai as the places that usually register higher number of dengue cases every year. Last year, there were 2,531 cases of the vector-borne ailment and five deaths in the state. 
 
 This year, sporadic outbreaks of H1N1 flu are keeping officials more busy. In January, close to 30 people from a locality in New Gummidipoondi of Tiruvallur district were admitted to hospitals with symptoms of H1N1. Three of them died. “We were able to prevent more deaths because a village health nurse followed up on a pregnant woman who hadn’t returned for a follow-up. We need to pre-empt and not wait for a death,” said Radhakrishnan.
 
 The government will continue the crackdown on quacks who, it says, often delay treatment of people with infections. Last year, health officials caught 105 quacks from various districts. According to the TN chapter of the Indian Medical Association there are 30,000 quacks in the state, mainly in rural areas.
 
 Radhakrishnan said the health department was working in coordination with the school education department to spread awareness among local bodies to address civic issues.
