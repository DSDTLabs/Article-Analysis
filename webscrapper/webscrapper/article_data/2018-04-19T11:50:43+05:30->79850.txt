AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday agreed to hear a review petition challenging its order restraining the publication of news on the surge in revenues of the company owned by  , the son of BJP president Amit Shah. The article had appeared in October last year on a news portal. Justice Paresh   summoned the state law officers to determine their view on the demand for review of the order passed by him on February 20.

 The petition to review the order was filed by  , who says he is an activist working for the rights of Scheduled Tribes. Bhabhor has contended that the gag order hampers people’s freedom of expression.
 
  He has requested the removal of the order so that freedom of speech and expression in Gujarat can be discussed in public, because the issue has a bearing on the elections of other state assemblies, particularly of Karnataka.
 
 In his petition, Bhabhor has stated that members of scheduled tribes want his opinion on the situation in Gujarat — where the BJP has been in power for more than 20 years — so that they can form an opinion on whether to vote for the BJP in the interests of the rights of Scheduled Tribes.
 
 Justice Upadhyay has asked Jay Shah’s advocates to make submissions on the matter because the order was passed on his appeal. The court has scheduled further hearing on Thursday.
 
 A civil court in Ahmedabad had restrained the media from publishing the news about Shah’s company, after he filed a Rs 100 crore suit against the news portal. The gag order was relaxed by the court earlier this year with a limited restriction that Prime Minister   not be mentioned in the report. Shah objected to this relaxation and Justice Upadhyay on February 20 reinstated the blanket ban.
