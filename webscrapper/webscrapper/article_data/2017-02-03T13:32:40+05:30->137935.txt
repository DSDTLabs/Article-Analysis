THANE: The failed robbery attempt at the   (SBI) branch in   last week remains an enigma for the police even as questions are being raised about the   systems in the bank.

 Gaining access inside the bank premises between Saturday night and wee hours of Monday appeared to be a cake walk for the thieves who made their way inside through the rear door.
 
 “The back door was the main access point for the accused as it was just a wooden door with a lock that could be broken easily. We are going through the CCTV footages that has been received from the nearby stores to get clues,” said senior inspector Madan Ballal of crime branch unit-5.
 
 The police are also questioning the bank officials about the internal alarm systems which are normally triggered in case of an unauthorized entry.
 
 ‘‘We suspect that someone familiar with the premises was involved as the robbers had duplicate keys of the iron grill doors inside, ” added Ballal. 
 
 It is learnt that three workers who carried out maintenance work inside the bank recently were detained for questioning by the crime branch unit-5 but the sleuths could not find anything substantial after interrogation and released them.
