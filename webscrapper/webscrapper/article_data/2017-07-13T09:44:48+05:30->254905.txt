 Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce president D Suresh Babu said the film industry in Hyderabad could not afford to have its image tarnished because of a few individuals getting into drugs.

 MAA president Shivaji Raja said there were 30,000 people in the film industry. “If 1015 people have been identified as being involved in taking drugs, it should not reflect on the entire industry,“ he said.
