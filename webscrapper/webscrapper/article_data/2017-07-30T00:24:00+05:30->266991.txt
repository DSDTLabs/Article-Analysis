Bhopal: A patient was diagnosed with H1N1 virus on Saturday — making it the second case in the city within a week. The deadly infection seems to have an early resurgence as usually the H1N1 cases spurt around September and peak in mid-October.

 A 45-year-old man — tested positive with the H1N1 flu — has been admitted to a private hospital. The patient’s condition is critical, said chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Sudhir Jesani. Swab specimen collection vials report has been confirmed by AIIMS Bhopal, he said. According to the district health officer, 12 samples have been sent for testing and are awaiting results. 
 
 Earlier, with the increase in the number of swine flu cases, a separate OPD for patients with the symptoms and an isolation ward was put in place. This time, however, due to the continued construction at Hamidia hospital, a H1N1 ward would be difficult, said sources in health department. The district hospital is yet to start a dedicated ‘H1N1 OPD’. Meanwhile, dengue cases continue to spurt in the state capital. In the last week alone, over 45 samples were collected for Eliza tests. Unconfirmed reports suggest that two more dengue infected patients have been detected, taking the total number of dengue cases this year to 15. 
 
 According to experts, H1N1 symptoms are similar to seasonal strains of respiratory infection. It exploits a weakened immune system to attack major organs, especially lungs. When it gets into the lungs, it can lead to pneumonia, which can be fatal. The flu can also cause secondary infections to the body leading to failure of vital organs and death.
