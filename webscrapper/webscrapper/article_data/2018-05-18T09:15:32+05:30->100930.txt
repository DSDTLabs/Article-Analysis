IDUKKI: A day after the wild elephant calf got separated from its herd at   near Munnar, the mother elephant of the calf was found dead at   near Chinnakkanal on Thursday.
 
 
 It was on Tuesday that a five-month-old baby elephant reached Chinnakkanal town. It roamed the town and later the forest officials put it in a temporary cage.
 
 
 
 
 The forest officials then began searching for its mother and on Thursday morning they found the body of the female elephant. Its post-mortem was held on Thursday by   assistant forest veterinary officer Dr   and   forest veterinary surgeon Dr C S  .
 
 “The 25-year-old female elephant died as it slipped and hit its chest hard on a rock. The body was three days old. The elephant was a feeding elephant and we suspect she was the mother of the separated calf which separated after the death of the female elephant. There are no health issues to the calf. Now, we plan to shift it to the elephant shelter at Kotoor,” said Dr Abdul Fathah.
 
 “We will keep the calf in the area till Friday morning to find out if any elephant herd comes in search of it. Otherwise, we will shift it to the elephant shelter,” added Munnar DFO Narendra Babu.
