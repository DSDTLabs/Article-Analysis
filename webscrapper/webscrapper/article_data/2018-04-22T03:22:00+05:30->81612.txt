Panaji: The   panchayat has sought more time from the high court of Bombay at Goa to file a reply in the case of allegedly illegal hill-cutting at Bobd, Socorro, for road widening. 

 Sarpanch Sandeep Vazarkar, who had been directed by the division bench comprising justices N M Jamdar and Prithviraj K Chavan to remain present, attended the hearing on April 18. The matter has now been fixed for hearing on April 25. 
 
 The writ petition has been filed by Filomena Costa Frias, who challenged the hill-cutting, felling of trees and widening of the road leading to Socorro church. 
 
 The court prima facie found that the panchayatâ€™s action in the road widening, if it was involved, was sans any legal basis. Since the public works department told the court that it was not involved, the bench directed Vazarkar to remain present. The bench also noted that substantial damage had been done and the work had no permission from the authorities.tnn
