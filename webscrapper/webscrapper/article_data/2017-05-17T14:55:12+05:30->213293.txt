BENGALURU: As individuals and players, David   and   are as different as chalk and cheese. Warner, the   skipper, wears his emotions on his sleeve, loves to have a go at the ball and the bowlers. In contrast, Kolkata Knight Riders' leader   is a difficult man to read on the field. He goes about his job with monk-like serenity, a smile is a rare gesture of appreciation or acknowledgement.

 But as captains, they have a lot in common. They are men who lead from the front, setting individual standards and team goals. Both top-order batsmen are the highest run getters for their respective teams by a margin.
 
 Warner, who has rediscovered himself as a leader with the Hyderabad franchise, has thrived and grown with responsibility, feels   coach  . "When some take the leadership role, it doesn't suffocate their own performance. If anything, they relish that opportunity and they grow with responsibility," he said.
 
 "David is one of those players who relishes the challenges of leadership. Knowing him, in his batting and fielding he has taken another step upwards," added the former Australian all-rounder.
