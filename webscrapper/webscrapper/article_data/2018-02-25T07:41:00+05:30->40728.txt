NAGPUR: Political science is a subject of social awareness because it’s the science of how society runs. The topics included in the   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) textbook are beneficial while preparing for civil services examinations like UPSC and MPSC too.

 A thorough textbook study and general knowledge is the only key to crack the paper and, therefore, eliminates the need to refer to any other study material. There are eight chapters which have compulsory questions of 15 marks each, so you should not skip any topic. The paper has first three multiple choice questions of 24 marks, which makes scoring easier.
 
 This section should be solved within first half an hour, so as to permit you with time to mull over the rest of the paper later. The remaining ones are short answer type and the last two are long answer type questions which can be elaborated on easily if you have studied the textbook cover to cover.
 
 You should read the question paper thoroughly, then go ahead with solving the parts you are most comfortable with. Students should have a conclusive study of topics such as ‘Indian Judiciary’, ‘Constitution’ and about law making procedures of our country as one long answer question is sure to be on the paper amongst them.
 
 There is also a part which tests your knowledge of the subject with open-ended questions, asking for your views or criticism of institutions. In my opinion, you should attempt this towards the end as it consumes time.
 
 Further, while writing the answers, keep in mind the marks you are aiming for. For instance, a two-mark question requires you to answer with three to four points only, so stick to the word limit and don’t waste your time in unnecessarily elaborating short answers. This will leave you with time towards the end to think about long answers and structure your thoughts.
