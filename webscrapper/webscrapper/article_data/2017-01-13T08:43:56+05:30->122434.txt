 “The agitators also said that the recent note ban has unearthed a small quantity of black money. Expecting very encouraging results, the entire nation stood behind the government and faced currency shortage for about two months. The nation was expecting that the decision would flush out significant quantity of black money. But it did not happen. The government should now launch effective and full-proof steps to curb black money,” he said.
