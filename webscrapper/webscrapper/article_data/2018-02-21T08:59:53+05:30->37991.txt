CHANDIGARH: As many as 43 snatchings have rocked the city in the first 50 days of the year, underscoring the failure of the police in curbing the crime.

 According to data from the police department, 146 snatching cases were reported in 2014, 159 in 2015, 161 in 2016 and 238 in 2017. Going by the rate at which   are striking, the figure could break the previous record by the end of the year and cross 300.
 
  
  
 
 Sources said around 70% of the cases have been reported from southern parts of the city, with maximum from areas under sectors 34 and 39 police stations. Police said sectors 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 56 and 61 are the favourite haunts of snatchers. The reason is that they are near   and provide snatchers enough opportunity to slip away into the state’s boundary. Besides these sectors, Manimajra, Khuda Lahora and   too are hotspots for miscreants.
 
 Police said drug addiction is the main reason behind the increase in petty crimes, especially snatchings. A majority of snatchers during interrogation have revealed they resort to the crime for their daily fix, police said, expressing helplessness in catching them.
 
 “It is not possible to depute cops everywhere and that too around the clock. We keep an eye out on old and notorious snatchers, but there are several first-timers,” said a police official. Police said they have arrested many accused but they are released on bail in two to three months and are back to their old ways. “Some of them are even acquitted due to lack of evidence and complainants failing to identify them in court,” said the police official.
