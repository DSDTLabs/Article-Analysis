Chennai: A 54-year-old woman died and two others escaped with injuries after suffering a five-storey-fall from a wooden   at a   in Teynampet on Tuesday night.

 S Shantha of Taramani was employed at the construction site of an eight-storey   for Aavin on Chamiers Road. On Tuesday, at around 9.30pm, Shantha along with two other workers, was carrying a load of construction material upstairs on the temporary shaft. 
 
 On reaching the fifth floor of the under-construction building, the rope from which the   was suspended snapped, causing the hoist to collapse. The trio fell from a height of about 50 feet. They were taken to government Royapettah hospital. Shantha, who landed on her head and suffered severe injuries, was later shifted to government general hospital where she died on Wednesday. 
 
 “The workers were not wearing  . We are questioning a few people,” said an investigating officer.
