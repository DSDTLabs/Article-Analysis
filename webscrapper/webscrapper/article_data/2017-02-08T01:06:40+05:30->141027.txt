NEW DELHI: Four hours after a one-and-half-year-old boy was abducted for ransom by a ragpicker on Monday, police rescued the child, Guddu, from Sunder Nagar in northeast Delhi.

 The accused, Satyaveer Yadav, had planned to demand a ransom from Guddu’s family and had locked him in a room at his rented accommodation. The family had approached the Nand Nagri police station minutes after he went missing while playing outside their house.
 
 “We had registered a case of kidnapping and formed a team to track down the accused and the child. A notice was issued on social media and at public places. The child was recovered within a few hours,” said Ajit K Singla, DCP (northeast).
 
 Police said the incident came to fore around 7pm when Guddu went out to play. According to his grandmother, after a few minutes he went missing from the spot. “We tried looking for him but no one had seen him around. The   footage from the area showed Yadav walking away with the child,” said a family member.
 
 Based on the grandmother’s statement, we registered a case and sent out teams to the possible hideouts of Yadav.
 
 Posters of Guddu were pasted at the nearby auto, e-rickshaw and bus stands. After four hours of search, police were successful in recovering Guddu from Yadav’s house. He was handed over to the guardians after a medical test.
