NEW DELHI: Suspended Aam Aadmi Party ( ) leader   today told the media that he plans to go to the Capital's Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) again at noon today "with more details on the tanker scam".

 "I will go to ACB at 12 noon today and divulge more details in the water tanker scam," Mishra said today outside his residence.
 
 Mishra was referring to an alleged Rs 400 crore water tanker procurement scam of 2012 when the  , with then CM   as its chairperson, "dodgily" awarded tenders to hire 385 stainless steel tankers from private companies. An FIR filed by the ACB in June 2016 mentions both the Dikshit regime as well as the   government.
 
 Mishra, who said yesterday he was on a hunger strike, today said he's continuing to not eat until AAP chief Kejriwal comes clean about how foreign trips of some AAP leaders were funded.
 
 In a series of letters from yesterday and the day before, Mishra questioned where AAP leaders got the money from for foreign trips, when Kejriwal said the party didn't have money even to contest elections. 
 
 The suspended AAP leader on Sunday stirred a giant storm when he alleged that he witnessed Kejriwal "take" Rs 2 crore from another AAP leader  , in what he implied was a questionable transaction.
