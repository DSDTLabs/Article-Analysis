THANE: Police will challenge a Bombay   order to release lawyer  , arrested on March 16 for his alleged involvement in illegally sourcing call data records (CDRs).

 The crime branch was embarrassed as the HC ordered Thane police to release Siddique and directed the home department to initiate proceedings against police officers for their “high-handed” behaviour.
 
 A senior police official said they consulted their legal team and decided to appeal against the order in the  . A team will reach Delhi in few days, the official said, refusing to divulge details.
 
 Siddiqui was arrested for allegedly obtaining CDRs of Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s wife and was remanded to police custody till March 23 by a magistrate court. Siddiqui’s wife appealed against the arrest in the HC, claiming her husband was wrongfully arrested without notice, which was in absolute violation of provisions under Criminal Procedure Code.
 
 A bench of Justices P D Naik and S C Dharmadhikari on Wednesday rapped the police and observed that they acted in a “high-handed” manner and did not follow “due process of law” while arresting Siddiqui and thus ordered his release.
 
 The crime branch has moved a 2,163-page   in the magistrate court of P L Gupta. A police officer said the charge-sheet has ample evidence against the seven accused initially arrested by crime branch after the case was registered on January 24.
 
 Police said they have attached 25 statements of witnesses too. A police officer said they will file a supplementary charge-sheet against the remaining accused.
 
 The main accused, Saurabh Sahu and Kling Mishra, are absconding.
 
 An analysis of the CDRs is on and telecom companies are helping police after the home ministry amended the rule which prohibits disclosure of details of people who sourced CDRs to any investigation agency.
