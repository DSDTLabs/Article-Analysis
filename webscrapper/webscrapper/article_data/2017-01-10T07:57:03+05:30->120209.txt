KANPUR:   patriarch  's elder brother   is a worried man today. 

 Though not into politics, Abhay Ram is upset over the standoff between Mulayam and son chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and wishes the feud is over at the earliest.
 
 "Since childhood, Akihlesh has been a stubborn kind of person. It's not easy to damage his future prospects. Going by his nature, I am sure he will come out unscathed and will be elected again as CM. He has performed well when it comes to development of the state," Abhay Ram told TOI on Monday. 
 
 Abhay Ram, who is father of Badaun MP Dharmendra Yadav, denied that he had visited Lucknow to mediate between brother Mulayam and nephew Akhilesh in the strife that is threatening to damage the party's prospects in Assembly polls.
 
 "I won't take any name, but everyone knows who is actually behind the strife. However, this is all about politics, in which I have least interest. You can ask me about 'khet' (farmland) and 'fasal' (crop), I will tell you more" he told TOI.
 
 "But then again, my only last wish is to see father-son duo uniting and fighting for the cause of the poor and the downtrodden," he added.
 
 On being further prodded over the ongoing family feud, Abhay Ram, without taking any name, gave a mouthful to the "people who are trying to create problems for Netaji and Akhilesh, besides their family members".
