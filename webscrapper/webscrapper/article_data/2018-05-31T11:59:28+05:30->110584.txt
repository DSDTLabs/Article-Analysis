MADURAI: The   bench of the Madras high court has granted an interim stay on ‘Solvadhellam Unmai’, a reality show being telecast on Zee Tamil television network. 

 The division bench comprising justices M V Muralidaran and T Krishnavalli gave this stay on a petition filed by R S Kalyanasundaram from Virudhunagar and adjourned the case to June 18 for further hearing.
 
 In his plea, the petitioner said that the programme organisers target innocent men and women for their show. The programme records all the illicit relationship issues pertaining to the individuals and completely ruin the reputation of women. The main aim of the programme was to improve the target rating point (TRP). It didn’t bother about individual’s right to privacy. Hence, it was necessary to restrain the television network from broadcasting the show and to direct the union’s information and broadcasting secretary, broadcasting content complaint council,   corporation managing director to take action against the channel, the petitioner pleaded.
