CHENNAI: Delhi chief minister   will attend the launch of actor Kamal Haasan’s political party on Wednesday in Madurai, the actor’s camp said on Tuesday. 

 Kejriwal is also likely to address the meeting, sources close to Kamal said. 
 
 He had called on Kamal here in September 2017, when the award-winning actor dropped hints of taking the political plunge. 
 
 Kejriwal had then said it was “important at this point when the country is facing strong forces of corruption and communalism, all like-minded people should talk to each other and work in tandem.”
