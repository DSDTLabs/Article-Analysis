LUCKNOW:   ( ) would link students’ examination form with their Aadhar numbers to avoid duplication. 

 “Linking to Aadhar will not only stop registration of the examinees more than once but will also expedite   verification of marks and certificates,” said controller of examination JP Pandey. He said linking Aadhar numbers with examination forms would also ensure authenticity of data. The Aadhar numbers would also be mentioned on the admit cards, mark sheets and certificates of students, he added.
 
  Moreover, it would be helpful in recording real-time attendance of examinees. As bio-metric attendance of a student is recorded, the Aadhar-enabled device would help track whether a student is present or not, he added.
 
 Becoming the first state university to do so, AKTU would also facilitate students’ access to their documents via digital lockers. Pandey said it would help students access their documents via the internet. The facility of the digital locker would enable students to access their digital lockers from anywhere using their passwords, he added. The locker would have documents like mark sheet, degree and migration certificate from the next session. A student can access his/her document digitally by entering the ID and password of their locker, he added.
