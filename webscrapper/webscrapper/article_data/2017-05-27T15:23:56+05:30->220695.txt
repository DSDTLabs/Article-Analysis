She says once something goes in the wash, she never gets it back. Maybe she should wash her clothes herself. Then she won't lose her pants. My mom says yoga helped her when she was 'expecting.' What was she was expecting? A surprise? She says yoga helped after delivery, too. But I didn't see anything get delivered, either. ðŸ¤” My Mom can do lots of poses. I can do the cobra pose. I'm doing it right now! And I can do the sleeping baby pose two ways - on my tummy and on my back. I'm getting very good at yoga. I better finish my stretches now. I think I hear my mom coming! @bombaysunshine"
