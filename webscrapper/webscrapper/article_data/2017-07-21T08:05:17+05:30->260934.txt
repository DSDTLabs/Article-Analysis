PUNE: Passengers travelling from   on a   (SG-534) faced a hard time when the flight was delayed by more than three hours on Thursday. Passengers alleged the airline’s officials were not providing contact details of their ground staff in Pune which added to their woes. 

 A passenger’s post on a social media platform said, “Please help.   delaying flight and no help from airline. With pregnant wife and senior citizens at Pune airport.” “The flight was to take off at 8.40pm. I am with my whole family and there are many passengers waiting. They are not confirming the departure time and are giving no facilities and no support," the passenger told TOI via Twitter. 
 
 Another passenger said, “This is getting too late. Why is the ground staff not providing any information? Passengers are losing their cool.” SpiceJet, on their part, tweeted, “Flight SG 524 is delayed due to consequential impact of ATC congestion at Mumbai and shall depart at 23.50 hours. Inconvenience is regretted.”
 
 “Your airport staff is not available/not contactable. At least provide their numbers,” the same passenger wrote. “We understand your disappointment! However, there are certain delays like congestion which are beyond our control,” the airlines answered. The recent week has seen many flights delayed at the Pune airport. They include an Air India flight, an IndiGo flight and another SpiceJet flight.
 
  Meanwhile, passengers of the delayed flight boarded it close to midnight.
