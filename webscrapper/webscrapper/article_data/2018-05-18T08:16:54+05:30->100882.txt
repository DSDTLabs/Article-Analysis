PANCHKULA: A   raged through the Terminal Ballistic Research   (TBRL) forest in Ramgarh for more than 18 hours till Thursday afternoon. Even when tree ash flew into the city, the TBRL continued to consider it a minor spark from some field test.

 The fire started around 6pm on Wednesday. Five fire tenders from  , besides those with the TBRL, fought the blaze all night, well into the early hours of Thursday, and beyond. Local fire station officer Shamsher Malik said some testing inside the forest had triggered the fire that had built into an inferno. “I sent as many tenders as I could,” he said.
 
 There was an atmosphere of fear when people of Panchkula found fly ash over their houses on Thursday morning. TBRL spokesperson Manoj Atwal said on being confronted: “A fragment from an experiment done with medium-calibre ammunition set some bushes and sarkanda (bamboo grass) plants on fire a kilometre from nearest buildings. No damage to life or property was reported.” “These fires are routine during experiment” Atwal said. “The situation is under control. We did not call the fire tenders from Panchkula, the local SHO (station house officer) did.”
 
 This is not the first time that the Panchkula set-up of TBRL is in news for wrong reasons. On December 12, 2016, a 6-foot-long, 1-foot wide, 5-quintal bomb fired in a wrong direction during a test landed outside the TBRL premises, into the forest area of Morni. Luckily, no one was injured. The TBRL officials at first denied that the bomb was their property. On January 1, 2016, another big fire broke in the TBRL jungle during yet another test.
