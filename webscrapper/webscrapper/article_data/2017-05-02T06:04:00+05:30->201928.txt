Panaji: Stakeholders in the state’s real estate sector will have to wait for around two to three months before Goa notifies the rules under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016.

 Minister for town and country planning (TCP) Vijai Sardesai said the rules would be notified in the next three months. He said that he met CM Manohar Parrikar on Monday to discuss the issue, as the Act came into effect from May 1.
 
 Sardesai told TOI that the chief minister informed him that the delay in notifying the rules was due to the code of conduct that was in force for the assembly polls. The CM said it would be done within the next three months, he said.
 
 TOI had recently reported that the town and country planning (TCP) department had drafted the rules under the central Act, along the lines of the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority’s ( ) rules and had even submitted the file to the secretariat.
 
 Although the RERA legislation of 2016 becomes effective across India on May 1, Goa is among the states that has not notified regulations under it. Only 13 states have notified the rules.
 
 According to Section 85 of the Act, rules are required to be notified by the regulatory authority within three months of its formation.
 
 Once the regulations are notified and the authority formed under RERA, every real estate project above 500 sqm will have to compulsorily be registered with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority in the state.
 
 If implemented in the letter and spirit of the central Act, Goa’s RERA rules could offer relief to existing buyers of real estate properties, both residential and commercial, who have still not got possession of their properties.
