NASHIK: Farmers in the region are a worried lot owing to constant rise in fuel prices that is adding to the production cost.

 Most of the farming activities like ploughing, watering the fields etc. are done through tractors and water pumps that operate on diesel. But since the fuel prices have gone up, the costs of farming activities have increased.
 
 Diesel prices have shot up by 39% in the past two-and-a-half years — from Rs 51.40 per litre on September 30, 2015 to Rs 71.45 per litre on May 21, 2018. And what has compounded the woes of the farmers is that the transportation cost of carrying the produce to the markets has also gone up.
 
 The farmers lamented that the cost of production has already increased due to rise in fuel prices and it is bound to increase more if the fuel prices rise further.
 
 “There is no alternate to diesel motors for cultivation during power failure. At present, 85% of the farmers in the district use tractors for ploughing the fields. The ploughing rates of tractors have increased by 30% from Rs 1,200 per acre last year to Rs 1,600 per acre this year due to rise in fuel prices,”  , an onion grower, said.
 
 According to him, the transporters have hiked their rates to transport their agriculture produce to   (APMCs) by tractors and other vehicles.
 
 “Transport cost increases if fuel prices go up. This also affects the production cost of the farm produce. Kharif season is now around the corner and the rise in fuel prices may also lead to rise in the cost of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, fungicides, among others,”  , divisional president of a grape-growers association, said.
