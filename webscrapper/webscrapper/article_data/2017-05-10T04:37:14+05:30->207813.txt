New Delhi: A Delhi   on Tuesday directed Congress leader Jagdish  , who has been given a clean chit by the CBI in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, and arms dealer Abhishek Verma to clearly answer whether or not they want to undergo a lie-detector  .

 Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Shivali Sharma said the court did not want any conditional consent and directed both Tytler and Verma to file affidavits with their respective stands or else appear before the court in person.
 
 While Tytler had earlier refused to undergo the test, Verma, who is a witness in the case, had given conditional consent and sought round-the-clock police protection claiming threat to his life.
 
 The CBI, however, had contested saying the consent for polygraph test should be unconditional.
 
 The central probe agency reasoned that the court had said on December 4, 2015 that a   detection test may be conducted, if required. CBI exonerated Tytler from all the charges earlier, following which Lakhvinder Kaur, whose husband Badal Singh was killed in riots, had filed a protest petition challenging CBI’s closure report.
 
 A Delhi court had in 2015 rejected CBI’s closure report and asked it to re-investigate Tytler’s role. The case pertains to riots at Gurudwara Pul Bangash in north Delhi where three people were killed on November 1, 1984.
