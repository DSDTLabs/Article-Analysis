PALANPUR: Mehsana town witnessed an unusual event when its municipality president Raviben Patel of   and other board members reached their offices on a camel cart on Saturday. 

 Patel said this was her way of protesting against decision of the civic body’s chief municipal officer of denying them an official vehicle.
 
 “The chief municipal officer took our car under his custody three days back. We are going to office either on two-wheeler or by foot,” Patel said.
 
 “Today, we hired the camel cart to reach office. This is to show how elected representatives of the   party are being treated,” Mehsana municipality vice-president Jaydeepsinh Dabhi said.
 
 “We have met the district collector and given him a memorandum against partial behaviour of the municipal officer. We are going to meet the governor on Monday. The party is also set to file petition against the civic body staff, who have been working as the representative of ruling   party,”   president   said.
 
 Of total 44 seats, Congress has strength of 29 in Mehsana civic body.
 
 However, chief municipal officer Navneet Patel refuted the allegations made by Patel. “The vehicle in question was with the president. However, I have to take it back to prevent its misuse. Moreover, the vehicle was used even for the long distance private travel,” he said.
