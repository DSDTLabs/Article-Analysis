The situation worsened when he started blackmailing some of her friends after accessing their skimpily-clad photographs. Sehrish was contacted by a guy named Ryaan Ali, who said he wanted her to attend a couple of events in India and Dubai. She recounts, “He first contacted me on a chat platform and asked me for my email id, ostensibly to discuss the details of the event and my remuneration. When he asked me for my verification code, I foolishly shared it with him. After that, he hacked into my Snapchat and started contacting my female friends. He downloaded their skimpily-dressed pictures and started blackmailing them for money.”
Fearing further misuse of her account, Sehrish immediately filed a complaint with the Cyber Crime Cell. “Though he hasn’t contacted me after that, a lot of my friends are still being harassed by this guy. I 
 want to spread awareness regarding this miscreant,” she says.
