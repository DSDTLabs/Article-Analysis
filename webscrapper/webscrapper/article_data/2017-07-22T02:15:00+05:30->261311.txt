Jaggaiahpet (Krishna district): Tension prevailed for some time at Jaypee   factory here on Thursday night when   staged a massive protest in front of the factory gate seeking a hike in their salaries. Some workers barged into the factory premises and ransacked furniture in the administrative office, prompting the Chillakallu police to intervene.

 On Friday morning, about 800 workers marched towards the factory. 
 
 However, the police stopped them from entering the factory. 
 
 Holding 18 persons responsible for the unrest, the police registered non-bailable cases against them under IPC section 306 (attempt to murder).
 
 Meanwhile, the factory management has agreed to discuss the issues with the workers and held a meeting with representatives Mariadasu and Ramoji Naik.
 
 The management reportedly informed the workers’ representatives that the company had incurred losses to the tune of Rs 16,000 crore and promised to increase the salaries as per labour rules after earning profits.
 
 The factory was established in 2011 and has not increased the salaries of workers since then. 
 
 About 1,000 workers are presently on the company rolls. “Most of the workers have given up their land after the factory had assured employment and good salaries to them,” Ramoji Naik told TOI. 
 
 UltraTech struck a deal with Jaypee Group in 2016 by buying its cement units in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh for Rs 16,189 crore. Presently, the salaries of the workers range between Rs 8,000 and 10,000 per head.
