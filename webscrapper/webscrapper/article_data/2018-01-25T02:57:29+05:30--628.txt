NEW DELHI: In a bid to ensure greater accountability and cut red tape, the Delhi Jal Board has overhauled its  . Chief minister  , who is also the   chairman, has been closely involved in the process. 

 With another round of   likely in the capital, there appears to be a greater urgency in redressing  , sources say. The practice of discussing pan-Delhi issues at board meets has now given way to “assembly-wise” meetings. These meets, presided by Kejriwal himself, are attended by the DJB CEO, EEs and local officials up to the level of junior engineers.
 
 An official told TOI: “The chief minister realised that the earlier board meetings had too broad a mandate and could not solve street-level issues as the stakeholders were not involved in the process. We are moving from ‘carpet solutions’ to tailor-made ones at the gali level. Under the new mechanism, a series of meetings with presentations of status, problems and possible solutions are being made at the assembly level. Twenty assemblies have already been covered.” 
 
  
  
 
 The involvement of junior staff is aimed at ensuring more realistic assessment of the situation at the ground level, an official privy to meetings said. To ensure accountability, the presentations are made available to the local MLA in advance. A file is closed only when the MLA confirms that the work has been completed satisfactorily.
 
 Each assembly gets a window of 45 minutes to an hour at the meet. “If a particular work is stuck due to bureaucratic hurdles, deadlines are fixed and a follow-up conducted,” another official said. “A part of these meetings is dedicated to fixing timelines on road restoration, as several complaints have been received about DJB not repairing damaged roads after completing the work,” the official said. 
 
 Among the decisions taken by the CM as part of this new initiative include recruitment of junior engineers on contract to tackle manpower shortfall and setting up of kiosks for bill collection.
