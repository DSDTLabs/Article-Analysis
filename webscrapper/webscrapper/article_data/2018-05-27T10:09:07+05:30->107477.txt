LUCKNOW: A year after appointing   as party vice-president,   chief   announced on Saturday that he has offered to step down to end the charge of nepotism in the party.

 
 At the meeting attended by representatives from over 20 states, Mayawati told cadres, “My younger brother, who held the position of vice-president, has offered to step down in the interest of the Dalit movement and to serve the organisation like an ordinary worker.” She added that with   stepping down, no one will be able to accuse her of indulging in nepotism.
 
 Referring to allegations of promoting dynasty politics in BSP, Mayawati said that several selfish and opportunist leaders were trying to promote their family members in the party. She also introduced an organisational change to prevent appointment of close family members of any leader, including herself, on any organisational position. The relatives may however serve as common party workers.
 
 Anand started his career as a clerk in   but forayed into business when Mayawati came to power in 2007. After demonetisation, Anand came under the lens of income tax department and enforcement directorate for links with bogus companies.
 
 The two agencies were probing Anand’s alleged nexus with some real estate players. Anand was also issued a notice along with several builders in this connection.
 
 In 2017, Mayawati appointed Anand as party’s vice president and delegated the responsibility to run party affairs in her absence but had said that he will not contest election.
