NEW DELHI: Union housing and urban affairs minister   took a dig at Delhi chief minister   over the alleged assault on chief secretary Anshu Prakash by AAP MLAs, saying he is “cautious” about mediating with the   over issues relating to the capital.

 In the course of a media interaction, Puri termed any effort to mediate as a “challenge” for him in the context of projects that are under discussion between the AAP government and the Centre. 
 
 Responding to a question whether he has achieved any success in negotiating with the Delhi government, Puri said, “Believe me this is a challenge and the question is what will be utility? There has not been any success because there have been some instances in between... Let the temperature come down. When I become hopeful then something else happens like the treatment (meted out) to the chief secretary. What do I do?” 
 
 Taking a potshot at AAP government, the minister said, “If this is the attitude, then I have to be very careful. If I call a mediation meeting and then some mis-happening takes place, then what do I do? There is no security in my room. I adopt a cautious approach,” he told reporters here.
 
 The Delhi government and the housing and urban affairs ministry have been at loggerheads over various issues including the Metro fare hike and the ongoing sealing drive.
 
 Participating in a debate in   last month, Puri had said, “In the four decades of my public life, I faced many challenges. I have tried to negotiate with terrorists, etc. This (dealing with Kejriwal) is going to be a difficult one but I will accept your challenge and try and negotiate.” He was responding to deputy chairman P J Kurien’s suggestion to mediate between Delhi government and the LG.
