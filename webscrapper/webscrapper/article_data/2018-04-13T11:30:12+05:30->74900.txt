JAIPUR: A group under the banner of ‘Third Front’ will organise agitation in front of the police stations across the state on May 9 to   against the police filing of FIR against Dalits during the   called by Dalit organizations on April 2.

 Convener of the group Dharampal Kataria, in a press conference said the   order allegedly diluting the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is a reflection of the Brahminical mindset in the highest judiciary. He demanded proportional representation to all communities in the judiciary including Dalits and minorities to remove this disparity. 
 
 He said even after 70 years the Dalits were not allowed to enter temples. “Even dogs and cats could enter a temple but not the Dalits,” asked Dharamveer could the courts could give a blind eye to the ground situation prevailing in the society.
 
 He said the Supreme court speaks about false cases were being field under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act but he asked why the police have not been able to file FIRs and make arrest the perpetrators of cases like rape and get conviction. “ It is not the failure of the law but the executing agency,” he alleged. So what is need is the system to be streamlined instead of changing the law, he argued.
 
 He said in Dangawas village in   district 40 people were named in the FIR for torching the houses of Dalits in 2015 but even after three years, 28 accused were still at large. The   Police which claims “fear among criminals and faith in common man” has not been able to provide justice the Dalits and other backward communities, he alleged. 
 
 He also asked what happened to the rape case accused   officer Madhukar Tondon who was charged with the rape of a tribal woman.
