GURGAON: A fire broke out at a beer bar in a city mall on Wednesday, amid nationwide jitters on the safety of hangout spots after the fire at two restobars in Mumbai’s   on December 29 in which 15 people died. 

 Unlike Mumbai’s 1 Above that was packed with revellers at the time of the blaze, The   on the ground floor of Gurgaon’s   in Sector 50 had no customers when the fire broke out around noon. There were only some employees inside the bar then.
 
 Moreover, Beer Café, located near the mall’s entrance, was apparently better equipped to tackle the flames, which started in the kitchen and were controlled by the bar staff themselves with the help of fire extinguishers and water sprinklers.
 
 Sources said as soon as the fire started, the smoke set the fire safety alarm ringing and activated the water sprinklers, which prevented the flames from spreading to other parts of the bar or the adjacent store of Raymond on its left.
 
 The bar employees informed the fire brigade personnel, who arrived within 10 minutes and doused the flames. Only a wooden rack of beer bottles and some other small stuff were damaged.
 
 Though customers in nearby stores got scared to see the lone fire tender on the mall premises, they heaved a sigh of relief when firemen told them that everything was under control.
 
 “Prima facie it seems that the fire was caused by a short circuit in one of the air conditioners inside the bar. By the time we reached the spot, the bar employees had mostly controlled the situation with the help of fire safety equipment. Later, we fully put out the fire,” said fire officer Sudhir Kumar.
 
 Gunjan Kumar, the manager of the beer café, said it was a minor fire and that the normal operations were not affected. “There was not a single customer at the time of the incident. We have all fire safety measures in place in our bar,” Kumar added.
