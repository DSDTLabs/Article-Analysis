CHANDIGARH:   (AAP) took on cricketerturned-politician   on Friday , describing his shift to the Congress as his “joining anti-Punjab forces“ and “weakening the people's movement against corruption“.

 In a statement issued here, AAP state convenerGurpreet Singh Waraich `Ghuggi' sa id Sidhu had targetted the Badal family for corruption and amassing huge wealth in 10 years.“But then he has been silent on corruption charges against Amarinder, who is an accused in Rs 400-crore scam of land acquisition by  ,“ he said.
 
 AAP's candidate from Batala assembly constituency said Sidhu had backed an “illicit political alliance“ between Capt   and Badal family by moving to the Congress. “If Sidhu is targetting Badals for corruption, it will not absolve him of complicity with SAD-BJP alliance's 10-year regime. As a chief parliamentary secretary , his wife didn't come out against the government. Sidhu also turned a blind eye towards corruption by staying away from Punjab,“ Ghuggi said.
