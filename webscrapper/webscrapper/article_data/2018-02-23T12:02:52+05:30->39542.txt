NEW DELHI: In the wake of the Rs 11,300 crore 
  , the   on Friday swung into action to set up new regulatory measures. The ministry has written to Hong Kong branches of four Indian banks asking them to reconcile accounts and check for irregularities, news agency ANI reported quoting sources. The four lenders - SBI, Axis Bank, Allahabad Bank and Bank of India - were issued Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) by  's Mumbai branch. 

 
 Reconciliation of an account involves confirming whether the money leaving an account matches the amount that's been spent.
 
  
  
 
 ANI further reported that state owned banks will now appoint a special representative or agency to monitor status for all loans of above Rs 250 crore and that a consortium of lenders cannot exceed 7 banks. Incidentally, in the Rotomac loan default case, the company's promoter   is alleged to have cheated a consortium of 7 banks of Rs 3,695 crore.
 
 
  
 
 These measures are effectively the first definitive steps taken by the finance ministry since the scam broke out, even as government agencies like CBI, ED and Income Tax department have cracked down on the accused. Earlier in the week, finance minister   had hit out at auditors and supervisory agencies, asking them to "introspect" to avoid cases of financial wrongdoing. "Also what were auditors doing? If both internal and external auditors have looked the other way and failed to detect, then I think CA professionals must introspect. Supervisory agencies also must introspect (about) what are the additional mechanisms they have to put in place," he had said.
