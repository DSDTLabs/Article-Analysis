THANE: In the wake of the upcoming  , the Thane police has listed the names of 50 trouble makers who are likely to be externed. This is part of the drill to keep such anti-social elements at bay in a run-up to the Thane civic elections.

 A top police officials said that the process of identifying the mischief-mongers began a year ago and the drive intensified after Ganesh festival in September.
 
 While elaborating the process, the official said that the police stations across the city were instructed to compile a database and update their records on habitual offenders and also those who are on the run. Once the database is formed, the accused are produced before the 
 
 zonal deputy commissioner of police (DCP), who gives them a warning. 
 
 If they continue to create mischief, then they are externed from the city for a period ranging between six months to 2 years, depending on the criminal background and behaviours. This decision is taken by the DCP. 
 
 Those who are externed include criminals who are charged in political cases, bootlegging and other serious offences, said joint commissioner of police Ashutosh Dumbre.
 
 “There is a possibility that the hardened criminals may play foul during the election period. Also, they could bully the voters as most of these   have a political backing. Some even threaten voters to cast their votes in favour of a particular party. So, the drive is undertaken to remove such trouble makers from not only the city, but the district. This will somewhat ensure free and fair election process,” said a senior police official.
