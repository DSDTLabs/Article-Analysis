JAIPUR : Rajasthan Technical University ( ) has granted a ‘mercy’ chance for engineering students of batch 2006, 2007 and 2008 to clear their back or pending papers in August 2018.

 These students have failed to clear their engineering degree due to pending papers. The decision has come as a ray of hope for over 3,000 students who fail to become engineers. RTU was established in 2006. The mercy chance was given to the students of initial years of the RTU.
 
 “The Board of Management (BOM) has taken the decision to provide a relief to these students of our early batches. It is likely that similar chance will be given to the students of 2009 batch also. The dates of the pending exams will soon be finalized but it is clear that exams will take place in the second week of August,” said  , teacher at RTU.
 
 The proposal came after several students from these batches have approached the university requesting them for a mercy chance. During the early years, RTU was struggling to conduct the exams and declaring results on time is also a reason that these students were given the advantage. Appearing in the exam after a gap of 10 years, Suresh Chaudhary (name changed), who is businessman based in Jaipur says that it’s a lifetime opportunity and will take his business to newer heights. “The absence of degree has cost me dearly. I have to add partners in my business to get the bank loan and other assistance which I was refused due to no degree,” said Chaudhary.
 
 Why the mercy chance is being given to students till 2009 batch? The official responded that students of the initial years were not aware of the rules and regulations dealing with the back papers. “The rule of clearing the back or pending papers in next four years from the year of passing came into effect in 2010. This is reason that mercy chance is kept for students of early years,” said AK Dwivedi, RTU.
