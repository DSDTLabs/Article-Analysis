KOLKATA: A problem that people had encountered days after demonetisation has resurfaced with ATMs in the city unable to dispense Rs 4,500, the  . 

 Professor  , who had gone to   with his daughter, tried out four ATMs but none would dispense Rs 4,500. “I was forced to settle for Rs 4,000 with the machine dispensing two Rs 2000 notes from an   located near SDF building. All plans to enjoy smaller delicacies like phuchka and chat had to be shelved,” he recounted.
 
 While Sinha’s mid-November experience had made him wiser (he realized the ATM rejected the transaction for Rs 4,500 as it did not have Rs 100 or Rs 500 notes) and hence requested for withdrawal of Rs 4,000, many others returned disappointed after the withdrawal request for Rs 4,500 was denied. 
 
 Bank officials said the supply of Rs 100 and Rs 500 notes remained much lower than optimum requirement to meet the maximum ATM withdrawal amount announced by RBI. “The limited amount of Rs 100 and 500 notes that are being loaded in the ATMs are getting exhausted soon as customers are withdrawing Rs 1,900 or Rs 1,500 at a time to avoid Rs 2000 notes. With the daily limit up to Rs 4,500, ATMs have to be filled up at least twice a day on a daily basis to meet the demand. That has not been possible yet,” the manager of a nationalised bank said. 
 
 Another bank official said ideally in every ATM, at least Rs 10 lakh worth Rs 500 notes should be stocked to service a reasonable number of customers keen to withdraw Rs 4,500. 
 
 Incidentally, RBI had on Friday instructed banks to ensure that ATMs dispense Rs 500 notes. The circular had even asked for ATMs in rural and semi-urban areas to be adequately stocked with Rs 500 notes. But banks complained that they could not comply with the instruction simply because the apex bank was itself unable to provide enough Rs 500 notes from its currency chest in Kolkata.
 
 Banking industry sources said the daily cash requirement for ATMs in the state was Rs 500 crore, of which at least Rs 100 crore had to be met with Rs 500 notes for the problem to get resolved. Retail market analyst   is hoping that it does. “I did not withdraw money on Monday because I already have too many Rs 2000 notes. I will try again on Tuesday and hope the ATM at Golpark dispenses Rs 500 notes,” he said.
