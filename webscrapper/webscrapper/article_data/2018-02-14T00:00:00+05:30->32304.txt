 Speaking to us, an elated Gowri, who participated in the festival for the first time, says, “The organizers mailed me with an offer to organize a sand sculpture expo, which I didn’t want to reject. The theme of my art was to show Saudi Arabia from my perspective. The festival was held for a month. The people and their culture were unique, so I needed to synchronize my art to their lifestyle. It was a thrilling experience; people were amazed with sand sculptures.
