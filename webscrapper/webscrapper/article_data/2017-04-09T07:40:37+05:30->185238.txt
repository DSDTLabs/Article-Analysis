PATIALA: Applauding the state government move to start an inquiry against an official of the  , over his alleged role in demanding money to remove objections on files for re-hiring staff, the re-employed varsity teachers held a meeting on Saturday and announced their full cooperation to the probe officer. The inquiry officer would take the statements of all 49 re-employed professors who had complained against Kartar Singh, deputy controller, local audit, alleging that he had demanded money from them to clear objections on their files.

 “Now the cat is out of bag. We extend our full cooperation to inquiry officer. The re-employed professors were insulted. In this corruption Kartar Singh may not be the alone while many others involved in this will also be exposed,” said Professor Jaswinder Singh.
 
 Punjabi varsity had hired retired professors during the tenure of former vice-chancellor   whereas the local audit wing of the finance department in 2014 had raised objections maintaining that such recruitments were in violation of the   guidelines. Following that the re-employed professors had then lodged complained against the officer alleging that he had sought money from them to remove objections.
