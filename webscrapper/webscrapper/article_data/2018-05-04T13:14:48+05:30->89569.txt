NEW DELHI: A day after a 14-year-old girl died after allegedly jumping off the fifth floor of her school in northwest Delhi’s Mahendra Park, her family suspects involvement of school staff in the incident. 

 Though, she did not leave a suicide note behind, her diary entries indicate that she was depressed,   said. However, her family disagreed saying she was happy and showed no signs of depression till that morning.
 
 Her best friend mentioned that they were playing half-an-hour before the incident. “She left home with me and a few others and was absolutely fine. She was the brightest student in our class and there was absolutely no reason for her to commit suicide,” she said.
 
 The friend, however, added that her friends did tell her that the girl was seen crying in the washroom during recess. They asked her if everything was fine, to which she did not respond. But the friends didn’t leave at that and informed the peon about her. Before they went to check on her again, she was dead. “I was numb and we were asked to leave the school. I have lost my dearest friend,” she added.
