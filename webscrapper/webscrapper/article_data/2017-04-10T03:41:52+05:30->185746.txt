LUCKNOW: All contracts allotted by the   will now pass through the   process. Until now, this process was applicable only to contracts of Rs 1 crore and above.

 The   has abolished that limit. A   (GO) has been issued saying that all contracts, irrespective of the amount, will be allotted through the e-tendering process.
 
 “The (PWD) department will also check unscrupulous and mafia elements from gaining contracts,” stated the order signed by additional chief secretary, PWD, Sadakant.
 
 Sources said there had been a practice of circumventing the prevailing system by breaking the contractual work into smaller segments to reduce the amount and allot it to a few ‘favoured’ contractors.
