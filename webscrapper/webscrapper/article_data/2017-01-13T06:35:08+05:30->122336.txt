HYDERABAD: Going by the records of the  , for every three fatalities of  , a death of a pillion rider is recorded. But the police have not turned their attention to   among pillion riders. Most fatalities involving two wheelers are due to head-on collisions and studies have shown that helmets can save lives, but the large number of pillion riders who are equally vulnerable are not the focus of police's the helmet drive.

 Cyberabad recorded 306 deaths of bikers in 2016, and 131 pillion riders too died during the period. Although similar records have not been maintained for Hyderabad, the ratio of   is similar, say experts.
 
 “In the case of pillion riders the maximum impact is between the head and abdomen area. Serious injuries to head or spine could require lifelong support,“ said Dheerendra Samineni, founder, Safe Drive India.
 
 The draft Road Safety Bill (Motor Vehicle Amendment Bill 2016) mandates a fine of Rs 1,000 for riders and pillion riders who do not wear helmets. The punishment can touch Rs 2,000 in case of repeat offences. Following this rule, states and cities such as Maharashtra, Mysuru, Bengaluru and New Delhi have made wearing helmets compulsory for pillion riders. Telangana is yet to formulate such rules.
 
 For Hyderabad getting the two-wheeler driver to wear a helmet is a challenging job.
 
 “Given the limited staff in   and traffic police, no matter how many checks are conducted, it is impossible to check every driver and pillion rider on the 35 lakh two-wheelers on city roads. Unless the number of two-wheelers is checked, there will be no solution,“ said J Pandurang Naik, joint transport commissioner, Hyderabad city.
