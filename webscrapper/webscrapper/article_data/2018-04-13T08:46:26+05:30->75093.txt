AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday completed hearing and reserved its order on   member Ahmed Patel’s application seeking dismissal of BJP’s Balwantsinh Rajput’s petition challenging results of August 2017 Rajya Sabha elections declaring Patel a winner.

 Rajput has questioned the Election Commission’s decision invalidating two votes by then rebel Congress MLAs on objection raised by Congress party. He has also accused Patel of indulging in corrupt practice by taking 44 Congress MLAs to a resort in Bengaluru and keeping them in captivity and spending lavishly on their entertainment.
 
 Patel filed an application in the high court seeking dismissal of Rajput’s election petition at the admission stage claiming it was filed in a faulty manner and with inadequate details, and not following the provisions the Civil Procedure Code. Patel’s advocate sought rejection of Rajput’s petition according to provision of Section 81(3) of the Representation of People Act.
 
 Patel’s lawyers submitted that Rajput had served an incomplete copy of his petition to Patel. Rajput’s allegations against Patel over Congress MLAs going to a resort in Bengaluru were levelled in a vague manner, and they do not constitute an offence due to absence of basic details.
 
 Earlier, Patel’s advocate Kapil Sibal had objected to Rajput impleading ECI as a party in the proceedings. Rajput’s lawyer defended it by submitting that since the objection was against EC’s decision, it was a necessary party. After hearing the argument, Justice Bela Trivedi had ordered Rajput to remove EC as a party respondent from the litigation.
