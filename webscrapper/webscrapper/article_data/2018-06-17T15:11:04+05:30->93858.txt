The first thing a   devotee would be asked by friends and colleagues on his return from the holy mountain would be the aravana payasam and the (in)famous unniyappam. While the aravana is sweet and edible, taking a bite of the unniyappam has always been a hard task, literally. Only those with a strong set of teeth would attempt to eat one whole. Not surprisingly, the appam was collectively tagged 'kadicha pottatha appam'. 

 Putting an end to the misery of the devotees, the Travancore Devaswom Board has now given a thumbs up to a few significant changes to the prasadam, so that people can relish it with much devotion.
 
 So why were the appams so unyielding, and what is going to change now? A source at the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) says, “A main concern of the Devaswom Board was that if they added more banana to the appam, it would lead to rancidity. So they used to fry it to the extent that it became too hard to bite. But now, they have devised a new formula with which it will stay fresh for a minimum of 15 days." The ingredients, though, would be the same for the appam - rice powder, jaggery, ghee and banana.
 
 N Vasu, commissioner, Travancore Devaswom Board says, "The CFTRI recently visited Sabarimala to study the process, and gave an assurance that they will be adopting newer methods of preparation of the aravana payasam and the unniyappam which will improve their shelf life as well."
 
 And devotees are expectedly overjoyed. Vijay Nair, who has never missed his annual pilgrimage to Sabarimala, is all excited that he can now present the prasadam to people without guilt, and see them bite into it to their heart's content.
 
 Meanwhile, the aravana is also going to have a makeover, and the amount of jaggery used has been reduced from 80% to 60%. “In terms of the flavour, the result is much better,” says the CFTRI source.
 
 The changes are expected to be executed from the next pilgrimage season.
