PUNE : Pune Municipal Corporation ( ) has demolished 14 bungalows as part of its demolition drive against illegal constructions built within 100 metres of   airport, which is a restricted zone.

 Property owners, whose buildings have been demolished, have cried foul against the action.
  
 
 “Action is being taken against these building following a high court order,”  , head of PMC’s anti-encroachment department, told TOI.
 
 The court, while hearing a PIL in June 2015, had ordered demolition of all illegal constructions built after the date of filing of the petition, i.e. October 3, 2003. A survey of the properties was conducted by the   and PMC following the order of the high court in Vadgaonsheri, Kharadi, Kalwad, Khese Park, Ahmednagar Road, Khulewadi and   areas.
 
 “A total of 147 properties will be demolished.” stated a PMC official.
 
 He said that the owners of these properties had gone to court for a stay order. Stay has been granted only for some properties. 
 
 Those whose properties face demolition have urged the government for a rethink of its action. They said that they have become victims of the civic body’s inaction. 
 
 “If the area was restricted then land deals should not have been allowed. We have paid the revenue charges to the collector’s office. They should have told us that the properties come under the zone barred for construction. But we were kept in the dark,” said Shekhar Kulkarni, an affected property owner.
