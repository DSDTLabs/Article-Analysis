ALLAHABAD: Another Congress leader Irshad Ullas has uploaded a poster of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Facebook. In the poster, Akhilesh and Rahul have been depicted as inseparable brothers, ‘Karan-Arjun’, from the 1995 Bollywood blockbuster. The poster also features Congress president Sonia Gandhi as the mother, a role which was played by actress Rakhi in the film. 

 “The Congress-SP alliance has brightened the electoral prospects of both the parties. The tie-up will ensure us a win over its rivals, Bharatiya Janata Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, in the UP elections,” said Irshad.
 
 With the alliance, both the parties will bag over 300 seats, added Irshad.
