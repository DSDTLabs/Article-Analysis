Kochi: Vigilance and anti-corruption bureau’s ( ) special cell has issued a notice to former minister   to record his statement in connection with the disproportionate  .

 Babu was told to appear before the VACB office in Kochi on Tuesday. The investigation team, however, is also planning to visit Babu at his residence to record the statement as the bureau had received information that Babu was unwell.
 
 “A complaint was filed by Babu with the home secretary stating that he has to add some additional information that he could not reveal earlier. Based on the complaint, VACB director has directed the investigation team to record his statement,” said a senior VACB official with the special cell.
 
 “We would conduct an investigation after perusing the new information he provides. If he is not providing any new information, then we would proceed with the ongoing investigation,” said the officer.
 
 Officials were planning on filing a chargesheet in the case within a month and a report in this regard was recently submitted before the VACB directorate. However, sleuths said they are not sure of submitting the chargesheet given the new set of possible information. “We cannot be sure about the date (submitting the chargesheet) right now as there is a chance of conducting a probe if the former minister gives pertinent information,” he said.
 
 VACB had registered a case against Babu and two others (allegedly his benamis) in 2016. The former minister has already been interrogated twice by VACB. Meanwhile, co-accused P S Baburam had earlier moved the high court seeking to quash the FIR citing lack of evidence.
