INDORE: The residents of   area approached ward corporator complaining about the delay in   of   connecting Paraspar Nagar with their locality. 

 The civic body had earlier hired a private agency for construction of this road. The agency had even started the construction work some four months ago, but has not been able to complete. “The contractor had started the construction work, but has stopped it for the past one month,” said Rajesh Kumar, a resident of the area. 
 
 The delay in construction work has started causing inconvenience to the residents of the area. “It has become difficult for us to use this incomplete road, and even the civic body officials are not ready to listen to our demand,” Rajkumar said. 
 
 After waiting for nearly a month or so for the contractor to resume the work, the residents approached their ward corporator Balram Verma and civic body officials. The civic body officials said that they were working on the project and it would be completed soon. 
 
 “IMC has issued notice to the contractor. If he fails to start the work before end of this month, then the civic body would terminate the contract and hire a new agency for this project,” said Verma adding that the agency would also be blacklisted by the IMC.
