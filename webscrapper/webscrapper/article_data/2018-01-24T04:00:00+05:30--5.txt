Surat: The CMP aims to create two-level network with emphasis on transit-ready streets and strengthening of mass transport that can drop people within 500 metre of their residences and work places by properly integrating different modes of transports.  Professor H M Shivanand Swamy of Cept University said, “It is a long-term strategy. The plan has defined development at different places in the city at different times.”  A transit-ready street will have wide footpaths, bicycle lane, utility area, service lane, four lanes for transport and vehicular movement and 9 metre gangway for BRTS buses.  Of the total 126 town-planning schemes for Surat, many have either been implemented or are likely to be finalized, creation of transit-ready streets will be possible only in New Surat areas.  “For the last 500-metre connectivity to residences and work places, we are looking at different non-motorized and motorized ways of transports from transit-ready streets,” an SMC officer said.  “We are looking at a scenario that will develop in the city after 30 years and planning in advance so that Surtis don’t have to suffer the chaos. Mobility is an issue in major cities of the world and last mile connectivity is a serious problem. The master plan document will help us tackle the issues of tomorrow,” said municipal commissioner M Thennarasan.
