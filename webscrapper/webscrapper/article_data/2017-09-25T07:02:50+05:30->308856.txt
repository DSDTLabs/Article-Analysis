AHMEDABAD: 
 

 Gujarat's nine nights of revelry has always attracted people from across the country but it is equally adored by many foreign nationals, be it tourists or exchange students. In fact, many students have made this city their home for the time being, are making an effort to learn the dance steps, rehearsing every day .
 
 “I love dancing and when I came to know about  , I immediately wanted to participate,“ said Joanna Geisler, from Munich, Germany . “I practise for a couple of hours after classes. Initially it was difficult to catch up but as and when we Ipractised with music, got into the groove,“ said Geisler who is a fourth-year designstudent at CEPT Univer sity. In terestingly, students at CEPT University have been performing garba in the same style and fashion for years. The six-step garba continues from the first round till the last and students have been learning the same. Many of them have been watching videos online to learn it.
 
 For many students coming from abroad, learning the dance is a way of understanding Gujarati culture too. “The most obvious question that came to my mind was why is this done for nine nights.Later I learnt, it is a form of worship and community celebration at the same time,“ said another exchange student from France.
 
 
 
 
 It was 11th year for the garba with a difference in the city on Sunday as over 700 persons with disabilities and their family members from Ahmedabad and other cities such as Kutch, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara participated in the festive fervour at a party plot in Nava Vadaj. The garba organized by city-based PHA International, a voluntary organization, saw participants swirling to the beats in wheelchairs.
 
 “The idea emerged from our observation that the persons with disabilities can't be part of the garba itself and we decided to provide inclusive environment. A number of persons earmark the Sunday of Navratri festival for the unique garba,“ said Pooja Mehta, co-founder of PHA.
