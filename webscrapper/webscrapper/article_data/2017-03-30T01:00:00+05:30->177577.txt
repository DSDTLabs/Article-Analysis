Abhay Deol, who is known to walk off the beaten path in films, has begun working on his next, 'The Field'. An American production by Guy J Louthan, the movie, helmed by  , is a crime drama revolving around the land mafia. 

 While Abhay plays a cop determined to bring down those in power, the film, set in Delhi, also stars Hollywood actor Brendan Fraser in a pivotal role. Further, it marks the return of veteran actor   to the screen after quite a while. 'The Field', touted to be Abhay’s edgiest venture till date, is not the only international project in his kitty. His next, though in Hindi, is a Canadian production. A sci-fi, the film has him travelling back in time to solve a mystery. In between shooting, the actor is also busy presenting off-beat films on digital/theatrical platforms.
  
 Interestingly, Abhay, who has shot for only one movie — 'Happy Bhag Jayegi' — in the last two years, is now doing three movies back to back. He says, “The last time I shot for three films back to back was when I did ' !  !', 'Dev.D' and 'Road, Movie'. It can get intense working like that, but now that I’m older, I'm more relaxed about the process.”
