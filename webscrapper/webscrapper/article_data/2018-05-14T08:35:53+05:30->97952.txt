PUNE: It was touted to be a tricky chase with rain threat hovering over it but   soon turned it into a walk in the park for   as they brushed aside   here on Sunday evening. Rayudu’s unbeaten 62-ball 100 not only brought up his maiden Twenty20 century, but also saw him cross the 500-run mark for the first time in the competition.

 
 
 
 Sunrisers skipper   felt the best part about Rayudu’s batting was its simplicity. “He seems to be (scoring runs) every day. To do it again and again is quite tough,” said Williamson.
 
 Rayudu has delivered for CSK each time he has come in to bat. The team did push him down the order to accommodate   at the top. But Rayudu continued to score. CSK coach   felt Rayudu’s contribution to the team’s good run in the season has been priceless.
 
 “He is one of the key reasons we are sitting close to the top of the points table. He has not only dominated the run charts but the manner in which he has done so has been fantastic. You need one or two players at the top to fire if you want to win the  . Rayudu is doing that and some other guys like Shane Watson, Suresh Raina and MS Dhoni are chipping in strongly,” Fleming said.
 
 He went on to add how Rayudu’s run-making has been contagious. “Much like Shikhar Dhawan and Kane Williamson from Sunrisers who make their skillset so infectious, Rayudu’s batting too has been contagious in the manner in which he has gone about his business,” said Fleming.
