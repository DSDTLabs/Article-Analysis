MUMBAI: A Malad resident was arrested for allegedly tampering with his passport by pasting a fake   over the   that he holds. 

 Vaibhavkumar Chaturvedi (35), who works as a salesman at a private ayurveda medicine manufacturing company, was caught during   check at the city airport on Saturday, and handed over to the  . He claimed that he committed the fraud to hide his marriage to an NRI doctor from his parents and family members. 
 
 Police said Chaturvedi got married to an aryurveda doctor, who holds a UK citizenship, in a city court six months ago. Since then he has visited her on two occasions. “Chaturvedi did not want his parents and other family members to know about his marriage so he pasted a fake work visa paper on the original spouse visa in his passport,” said senior inspector B T Mukhedkar.
 
 “In February, he visited the UK and lived with his wife for two weeks. During his stay there, he got a resident permit,” said a police offficer. “He returned to Mumbai in February-end. Later, he told his parents that he would fly to the UK on March 11 on an official tour. He did not tell them that he had got a resident visa and was going there to meet his wife,” the officer added.
 
 Chaturvedi was booked under the Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document of electronic record). 
 
 He was produced before the holiday court on Sunday and remanded in police custody till March 15.
