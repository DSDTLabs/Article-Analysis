PATNA: With the mercury moving northward, the   (ECR) has begun preparations to offer respite to passengers from the scorching heat.

 Sources said at least 14 RO machines have been planned to be installed on different platforms at Patna Jn. While IRCON is setting up free water facility, the IRCTC’s will be a paid service.
 
 Environment-friendly bamboo shades are also being set up across all platforms. According to an official, these shades beat the heat better compared to the previous concrete structures that used to absorb the warmth and heat up the platform, making it uncomfortable for the passengers to use it.
 
 ECR’s chief public relations officer   said control rooms would start monitoring the water availability at each station and check availability of clean and cold drinking water everywhere. “We will also make sure that fans on our station premises are in running condition,” he said.
 
 According to  , who frequently travels to Delhi for business purposes, it becomes difficult for him to wait at the station if the train is late, especially in summer months. “Patna has such a humid summer climate. Without overhead fans or a shade, it is difficult to wait for a train in summer,” he said.
 
 Priya Sinha, an AIEEE aspirant on way back to Kota after Holi holidays, told this reporter on Thursday she consumed excessive amount of water in summer. “I am thankful to the ECR for making RO water available to passengers at the station,” she said.
