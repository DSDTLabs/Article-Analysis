TIRUVANNAMALAI: A group of youngsters in the temple town came together on Sunday for a social cause - to clean and rejuvenate an ancient tank that has been polluted for over two decades. 

 The initiative was taken by 28 year-old M Ragavan and his friends S Ragu, Neelagandan,   and  , all residents of   street in Tiruvannamalai town, and has become a movement to breathe life into   tank.
 
 Sources said that the tank- once spread over 18 acres- has shrunk to eight acres now due to encroachment and indiscriminate dumping of waste.
 
 The tank is as old as  , say elders of the town. "Till 1982, the temple priests used to fetch water from the tank every day. It was the main water source for a major part of the town then," said 67-year-old K Shanmugam.
 
 However, the age-old practice came to an end in the mid-80s after the tank was polluted by the residents of the locality. "I am happy to see the youngsters' effort to clean the ancient tank," he added.
 
 It all started on September 18 last year when youngsters rolled up their sleeves to free the water tank from pollution. "We have cleared 20 tonnes of waste and debris till date. Apart from this, we have also collected bio-medical waste such as syringes and gloves that were dumped in the tank. We have also cleared 'Karuvelam' trees and weeds from the bunds of the tank," said Ragavan, a tourist operator.
 
 R Maruthu, 24, said that they clean the tank for eight hours from 9am to 5pm. 
 
 Many have also helped the youngsters by providing food and equipment.
 
 However, over 120 hours of hard work from the youngsters would go in vain, if the local body administration did not take necessary steps to stop the residents from letting the sewage and drainage water into the tank.
 
 Raghu said the temple administration had been maintaining the water tank before it was ruined. 
 
 "The temple administration had employed watchmen for 13 years in the 1970s and 80s to prevent people from misusing it," he said.
