MUMBAI: The man who had allegedly sent a lewd message to BJP functionary   has been identified as an   alias Sinku who claims to be a BJP activist from Varanasi. Even as a police team has gone to Uttar Pradesh to nab Singh, Shaina has sought strict action against the man in order to send out a "strong message to such perverts". 

 Last month, Shainahad lodged a complaint against Singh for sending her "vulgar and obscene messages" on her cellphone. According to the police, Singh had initially sent her birthday wishes and had even referred to her as "sister", but she said that the tone of his messages had changed eventually. She had said that he started sending "lewd and objectionable" messages.
 
 The police then registered an offence of outraging the modesty of a woman besides slapping sections of the Information Technology Act.
 
 A police said source that their team had almost got Singh and he is likely to be brought to Mumbai by Sunday. However, this could not be confirmed with any police officer.
 
  "I'm really surprised as to how the accused has been sending me such dirty messages," said Shaina. "I wonder what happens to common women. There would be several such Romeos and not every woman may dare to lodge a complaint. My purpose of lodging a complaint against such a rowdy person is to teach him a lesson as also to tell other women in society that they should speak up."
 
 Shaina said that she was planning to start a helpline through her father's NGO which will offer legal help to women who have been targeted by such perverts. "This helpline will help and guide women who are not financially and emotionally strong to fight back." said Shaina.
