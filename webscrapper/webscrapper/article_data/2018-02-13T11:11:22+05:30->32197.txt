HYDERABAD: Telangana PCC chief spokesperson   has alleged that there is a larger conspiracy behind TRS minister K T Rama Rao’s comments against the  , calling it a ‘loafer’ party. 

 He said that Rama Rao’s comments were not spontaneous but part of a well-hatched conspiracy of the TRS and the BJP to divert people's attention from the injustice done to Telangana state in the Union Budget. 
 
 Dasoju had alleged that the TRS has entered into a secret alliance with the BJP. When PM Narender Modi was spitting venom against Telangana in Parliament, TRS MPs remained silent while Congress lodged a strong protest, they said. 
 
 Calling  , a master conspirator, Dasoju said when someone searches the word 'kutra’ in Google then KTR's image appears on top.
 
 This might happen due to some technical reason but political leaders and social media peole are trolling him on this and sharing this in social media. 
 
 Actually the news related to KTR contain some other content and none of the news is related to any conspiracy thing.
 
 
 
 
 It is a very common experience for netizens in Google that it shows wrong images for right persons. If we search for movie actors and celebrities sometimes the search engine show very irrelevent images. But when it happens to political leaders it turns ugly
