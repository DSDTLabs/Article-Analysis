Surat: Bina Shah, who was awarded life imprisonment on being found guilty of murdering her sister-in-law Ami Shah in 2007, faked suicide at Lajpore Central Jail (LCJ) here on Friday. Bina claimed she had consumed 12 paracetamol tablets when she was being transferred to Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad. The doctors of the jail sent her to New Civil Hospital (NCH) for a medical check-up.

 LCJ’s senior jailor R C Adreja said, “She has been issued transfer orders and was to be shifted to Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad. Police escorts had arrived but at the last moment she claimed that she has consumed 12 paracetamol tablets and would die soon. We got her checked-up in the jail and sent her for further check-up at NCH. It seems to be a drama.” 
 
 Bina was convicted along with her sister Falguni Shah of murdering their sister-in-law Ami Shah over a dispute for a property valued at Rs13 lakh. The duo had injected Ami with an injection and then strangled her to death when she was lay unconscious. They took her body to a farm at Abrama, some 12km from Surat and burned it there. Bina has been in jail since her arrest in 2007 and was convicted in 2016 by a sessions court. She had attempted suicide in 2010. A cell phone was found from her barracks during checking in 2012. She is considered a notorious character of Lajpore Central Jail and frequently fights with doctors and jail officials if her demands are not met by them, sources said.
