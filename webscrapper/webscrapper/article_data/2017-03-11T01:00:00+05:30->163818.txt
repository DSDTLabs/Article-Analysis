It may have been released in the 1990s, but this chart buster still finds takers across dance floors in the country.  , featuring   and  , set the screen ablaze. Their inimitable jhatkas and thunderous moves are raved about even now. The song has been recreated for Abbas Mustan’s 'Machine', which will also mark the launch of Abbas’ son Mustafa. BT exclusively spent a day at a suburban studio where the third day of the song’s shoot was on in full swing. A vintage car adorned a corner of the set, suspended chandeliers added glitz, and the film’s leading lady  , along with her hero, set temperatures soaring with some sensuous moves: 

 Abbas-Mustan: We had zeroed in on Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast but had heard that it was difficult to obtain its rights. We approached the music label, and given our old association with them that started with Khiladi and continued for six more films, they readily agreed to give us the song. They didn’t even charge us for the rights. 
 
 Bosco: Abbas-Mustan called me after they got the rights. I was excited. The original had Akshay Kumar and Raveena Tandon. I’ve grown up on the song. His moves, bandana and glares are still etched in memory. Raveena was a vision in white. I’ve created something fresh keeping the essence of the old song intact. 
 
 Mustafa: I must’ve been five when the original song released. I was in love with Paresh Rawal’s glasses. Our version has a lot of energy and sensuousness, and is shot in slow-mo. We were on floors for three days. I understand that comparisons with the original are inevitable. But our version is a tribute. 
 
 Kiara Advani: Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast is played at every wedding and party. I’ve heard that song since I was a kid at almost every bash that I’ve been to. I found the opportunity to recreate the magic of that song in front of the camera. It feels surreal.
