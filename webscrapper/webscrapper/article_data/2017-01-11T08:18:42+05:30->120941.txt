BHUBANESWAR: The state government has decided to rope in Nalco to devise ways so that devotees to   in Puri can have a hassle-free experience. 

 From improving the hygiene inside the temple and the   located inside its premises to managing the rush of devotees, the three experts to be hired by the public sector undertaking will assist the   in the endeavour. 
 
 "The experts to be hired by Nalco will guide the temple authorities on how to handle the rush of the devotees and how to maintain hygiene by training and organising those selling mahaprasad in Ananda Bazar," a government officer said.
 
 Ananda Bazar is like an open dining area where the mahaprasad (abhada) is sold to the devotees. But the place is always crowded with devotees and those selling prasad. During rush hour it gets even more congested. 
 
 The premises of Jagannath Temple also gets polluted due to peja (kitchen effluent) generated from preparation of mahaprasad. Everyday about 50,000 kilo litres of peja is discharged from the kitchen to the drain, leaving behind a foul smell. 
 
 The government has also decided to adopt the best practices followed at several big temples and religious places in the country to keep the Jagannath Temple clean. 
 
 The action plan also includes improving the town's infrastructure to attract tourist flow. Aluminium giant Nalco has also been asked to take up landscaping of   so that it can be turned into a hang-out zone for tourists.
