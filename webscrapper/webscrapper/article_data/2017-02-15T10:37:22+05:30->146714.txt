BENGALURU: Late Tamil Nadu chief minister   confiscated in the disproportionate assets case and in custody of Karnataka is back in focus with the Supreme Court upholding the conviction of AIADMK general secretary   and two others.

 “If the Supreme Court had acquitted the accused, the assets would have gone to the claimants. Now that the apex court has found the accused guilty, the wealth should be handed over to the Tamil Nadu government,“ said Karnataka additional advocate general  . “The   now has to submit an application before the special court seeking possession of the assets,“ he said.
 
 Karnataka police are guarding the assets seized by income tax officials in 1996 in two locations. Of the seized assets, 10,500 saris, 750 pairs of slip pers and 500 wine glasses are in a room on the first floor of the city civil court. The I-T department handed the assets to the government in 2003 when the case was transferred to Karnataka. The assets include 21.28kg of gold jewellery worth Rs 3.5 crore, 1,250kg of silver articles worth Rs 3.12 crore, diamonds worth Rs 2 crore and a silver sword.
 
 While the special court in Karnataka took up the trial, the Tamil Nadu government had borne the expenses. Officials said the final expenses would be calculated and the balance, if any, claimed from the TN government.
 
 The SC has fined each of the three Rs 10 crore and legal experts said the TN government was entitled to sell a portion of the assets to raise the fine amount in case the convicts fail to pay the same.
 
 Ponnanna said that while the jewellery had value, the saris and slippers were not in good shape. “They have been stored in a room for a decade.We need to see if they are usable. If they are unusable, they have to be destroyed following due procedure,“ he said.
