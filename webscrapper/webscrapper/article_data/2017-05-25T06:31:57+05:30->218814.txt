Cancun: India has come in for praise at the 2017 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction for being the first country to draw up a national plan and a local strategy for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and for having made significant progress in its commitments to bring down disaster losses and check climate change. 

  Representatives of 176 countries, including more than 50 ministers and at least seven heads of state, are attending the global platform, organised by the UN's Office for Disater Risk Reduction (UNISDR). The Indian delegation is led by minister of state for home   and comprises a high-level team from the   and the home ministry, including the PM's additional principal secretary P K Mishra . 
 
  India is leading a global intervention to bring down disaster losses which pushes more than 26 million people hit by natural calamities into abject poverty every year . The UN's DRR meet in Cancun is seen as the most important global event after the Paris climate change conference of 2015 where countries will show their progress made on the Sendai declaration which binds all signatory UN nations to bring down disaster related deaths and implement the roadmap agreed upon by 2030. India is the only country which has drawn a comprehensive national plan on its roadmap to fully achieve the Sendai framework by 2030, and a short term goal by 2020 . 
 
  "India is the largest democracy which has braced the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction and has drawn a national and local strategy with a short-term goal achievement target set for 2020," said   of UNISDR.
