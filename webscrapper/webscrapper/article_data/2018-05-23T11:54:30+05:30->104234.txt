MADURAI: Violation of human rights in the police firing on Tuesday was total and those who fired the shots at the people were not in police uniform, alleged human tights activist and executive director of Peopleâ€™s Watch,  , who was witnessed to what he called police excesses.

 
 
 
 HT: Yes, we went there to monitor the protest and had informed the superintendent of police of Tuticorin as well as the   of our move to do so.
 
 
 
 
 No formal procedure was followed before the police firing. Lathicharge and tear gas should have preceded the police firing if any, but both happened only outside the collectorate premises. It was direct firing inside the collectorate.
 
 
 
 HT: Yes, there was firing in   also.
 
 
 
 HT: I saw some persons open fire, but I do not know if they were police as they were not in uniform. No proper public announcement was made before the police firing and it was indiscriminate.
 
 
 
 HT: Yes, for one if at all the police wanted to disperse the crowds they should have used pellets and not bullets. The fact that some of the victims received the bullets in their mouth is proof that the motive of the police was to kill.
 
 
 
 HT: No. They were not out of control and continued to march towards the collectorate, but it was only after the police opened fire that they entered the Sterlite staff quarters and set fire to vehicles.
 
 
 
 HT: The inquiry should be conducted only by NHRC and   and not a retired judge, as commissions headed by retired judges have failed to deliver justice in many cases.
