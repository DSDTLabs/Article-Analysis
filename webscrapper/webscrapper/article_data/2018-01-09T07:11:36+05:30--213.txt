BENGALURU : The drunk driving menace continues to be rampant in Bengaluru, which recorded the highest ever number of cases for the offence in 2017. A staggering 73,741 cases were booked last year, up by 25% from the 59,028 cases witnessed during 2016. The number stood at 62,576 in 2015. 

 Strict enforcement, frequent awareness drives to encourage motorists to hail cabs instead of driving home and warnings to cancel the licences of those caught driving under the influence of alcohol seem to have failed to rein in offenders. In fact, several schoolbus and ambulance drivers were also booked for the violation last year.
 
 Additional commissioner of police (traffic) R  , though, begged to differ. “Last year saw the highest number of   in the department’s history. But the increase is because of stringent checks. We are recommending to the transport department to suspend the offenders’ driving licences,” he asserted.
 
  
 
 
 December, the month of revelry, was also the busiest month for Bengaluru traffic police. It witnessed 10,517 drunk driving cases in the city. Records show that over the past three years, the maximum drunk driving cases have been reported in December. The number was 6,666 in December 2016 and 9,461 in 2015.
 
 Hithendra said special checks were conducted in December because it was the festive season. “Some motorists are not bothered about the penalty. They pay Rs 2,000 as fine and know they will get their licence back in three months. Stringent punishment is required against those who refuse to fall in line,” he said.
 
 As many as 1,187 motorists were booked for drunk driving on December 30, a record number for a single day, according to police. The earlier record stood at 1,090 which was achieved on the night of December 30, 2016.
 
 Motorists caught driving with alcohol content of 30mg and above per 100ml of blood are liable to be charged with drunk driving. In the US or the UK, one can drink and drive with less than 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.
 
 The Motor Vehicles (Amendment)   has proposed to increase the fine amount for drunk driving from Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000. Prince  , founder,   (CADD), an NGO, said the government should take proactive steps to curb the menace. “Traffic police should publicize the list of motorists caught for drunk driving. Their licences should be cancelled,” opined Singhal.
