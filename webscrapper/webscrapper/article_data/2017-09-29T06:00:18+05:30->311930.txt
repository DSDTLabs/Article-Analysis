RAJKOT:   BJP MLA Jairajsinh Jadeja and two others convicted in a 2004 murder case surrendered before the   in Gondal on Thursday following directions of the Supreme Court. 

 On September 19, the SC had refused to stay Gujarat high court’s order asking the trio — who have been sentenced to life imprisonment — to surrender. On August 11, the HC had reversed a trial court’s order of acquitting Jadeja and his two aides — Amarjitsinh Jadeja and Mahendrasinh Rana — and convicted them to life imprisonment. They were asked to surrender before the jail authorities by September 30. 
 
 Jadeja and 15 others were chargesheeted in the murder case of real estate agent Nilesh Raiyani, who was allegedly killed over a land dispute. Raiyani was shot dead on February 8, 2004, while he was travelling in a car. Earlier in 2010, a fast track court in Rajkot had acquitted Jadeja in the case. However, of the 16 accused, it had found Samir Pathan, an alleged associate of Jadeja, guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
 
 Later, Pathan as well as the state government approached the high court against the lower court’s verdict. While Pathan pleaded innocence, the government challenged the acquittal of 15 others in the case, including Amarjitsinh Jadeja. Raiyani’s elimination was in the chain of murders that happened over the 35 acre land and a fallout of an ugly caste war in Gondal.
 
 Raiyani was shot dead when he along with two friends — Jagdish Satodiya and Ramji Markana — were travelling in a car. While Raiyani died on the spot, Satodiya sustained injuries in the attack and Markana escaped unhurt. Satodiya lodged a complaint against Jadeja and 15 others, including local BJP leader Jayanti Dhol and former under-19 cricketer Mahendrasinh Rana.
 
 Rajkot district yuva morcha president Vinu Singhala was also murdered in the case as had wrested the land from Rana. Before Raiyani, a dismissed SRP constable Vikramsinh Rana was killed allegedly by Singhala and his men.
