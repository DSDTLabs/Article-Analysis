 is probably the only comedian who has stuck with   in times of crisis. He shot for all the recent episodes without the old team, but now the comedian, who is currently holidaying in Hong Kong, is missing his on screen family. 

 Taking to Twitter, Kiku wrote: As I holiday here in HK with my family , I miss my onscreen family @WhoSunilGrover @kingaliasgar @haanjichandan @preetisimoes @neetisimoes 
 
 
  
  
 Evidently, Kiku is missing his fellow cast members,  ,  , Chandan Prabhakar, and show's creative head, Preeti Simoes and her sister Neeti on the trip. 
 
  
  
 Even though it was said that Kapil had hurt Kiku's feelings as well, but somehow he hasn't boycotted the show and even wished Kapil on his birthday. On Twitter, he had written, "Happy BDay brother...thanks for helping me make the world laugh, there could be no better job. #respect"
 
  
 
 Kapil has been in news for quite some time now due to his alleged fight with Sunil Grover on a flight. Kapil had reportedly abused and assaulted Sunil, even hurling a shoe at him. Post the spat, comedians Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar have stopped shooting for   to stand in solidarity with Sunil. All of them refrained from wishing Kapil publicly on his birthday. 
 
 After his fight, Kapil had apologized to Sunil on Twitter. But this wasn't met with the same enthusiasm by Sunil.
