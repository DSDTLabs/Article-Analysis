After a delegation of parents and minor students aspiring to get admitted to Guru Gobind Singh Sports College met with chief minister Aditya Nath   on Tuesday, alleging fraud by the office of the   in age certification of the candidates, an inquiry in the matter has been sought by the CM. 

 Parents had claimed that while the   office was not taking into consideration age of candidates based on Aadhaar and birth certificate, ultimately increasing the childrenâ€™s age on its final report, the CMO had said that the report was fair, based on the medical examination and X-ray report of the bone structure.
