Ghaziabad: A 47-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly forging documents to grab a plot worth Rs 80 lakh belonging to his estranged wife.

 Police said that the accused, Gulshan Kumar, had used a   of one of his women friends in place of his wife’s photo to get the power of attorney from her and then subsequently sold the   to another person.
 
 Gulshan’s   Usha, whose picture he had used to acquire power of attorney, is untraceable.
 
 Gulshan’s estranged wife Rajani Thapar (42), a resident of Rajouri Garden, had lodged an FIR against her husband and Usha at Vijay Nagar police on January 29.
 
 Rajani said she had got married to Gulshan in 1998 and the couple had two sons. She alleged she was being illtreated by her husband, who runs a cooler manufacturing plant in  , ever since their marriage, but did not walk out of the house until 2016, when it apparently became unbearable.
 
 “I had bought a plot of land in Vijay Nagar’s Pratap Vihar in 2007 and built a two-storied house on it. In February 2017, Gulshan, along with Usha, got the power of attorney on my behalf. A month later, he transferred the registry of the land to his brother Harish Kumar, who in turn sold the land to one Rahul Sachan in November 2017,” the woman said.
 
 “Till this time, I was not aware of the forgery and came to know about only in December. When I confronted my estranged husband about it, he threated to kill me and my two children. In the meantime, in May 2017, he had also sent me a divorce notice,” she added.
 
 In the meantime, Rajani went to Vijay Nagar police station and lodged a complaint. An FIR under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC was filed.
