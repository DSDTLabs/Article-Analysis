PUNE: The under-construction Warje flyover on the   bypass could open to traffic by the end of June, if everything goes as per plan. 

 The   ( ) expects work on the flyover, near Popularnagar, to finish in the next few weeks. One wing of the flyover, which will cater to traffic moving towards   from Dehu Road, will be opened in June last week. 
 
 This will come as a relief to commuters, who will not have to face waterlogging issues on rainy days, NHAI officials said. 
 
 NHAI officials said they had fast-tracked work on the flyover, which had begun a few months ago. AS per officials, crucial work pertaining to a slab was completed recently. Curing will take another 15 days, work on the landing areas on both sides is nearly complete. “The bridge is expected to be made open to vehicles by the last week of June, if things go as per plan,” an official said.
  
  
 The half-a-kilometre-long, two-laned flyover will provide uninterrupted travel for those driving to Katraj. “About 75% of the work on the flyover is done,” an official said. The flyover will augment the existing flyover, which goes over Warje chowk. 
 
 The NHAI has said that they have enough precautions in place to avoid any traffic jams or chaos. “The service lanes on both sides have been opened to commuters, providing much-needed relief from traffic jams. So far, the stretch has not witnessed any snarls. Those coming from   on the bypass that wish to enter Warje can use the service lane after Dukkarkhind. All other vehicles going towards Katraj can travel in the main lane,” an NHAI official said. 
 
 The authority has also planned a similar flyover for vehicles travelling from Katraj towards Dehu Road. The work on this wing will begin after the completion of the ongoing work. “We have avoided work on both wings simultaneously to curb traffic snarls,” an official said.
 
 Residents of the area and regular commuters on this stretch said the new flyover will be of great help to them.
