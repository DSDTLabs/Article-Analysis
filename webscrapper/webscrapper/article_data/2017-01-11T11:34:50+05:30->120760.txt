Vadodara: The razing of   guesthouse of   will not take place till Friday as Gujarat high court extended the stay granted for the demolition till then. The extension was granted as the district panchayat sought time to furnish a reply on the petition filed by tenants who are in possession of the shops on the ground floor of the guesthouse complex.

  (VMC) had started razing the Pathik Bhavan on Sunday night, but had to stop the process as the shopkeepers approached the HC that granted a stay. The shopkeepers had filed a petition in the HC in 1987 and around 1995 a stay was granted. But the VMC was not a party to the suit that was filed against the district panchayat. This was done only after the move to raze the complex by the civic body.
 
 VMC officials said even reports on the fitness of the building prepared by the district panchayat had clearly stated that the structure was dangerous. The district panchayat had in the past passed resolutions that the structure should be razed.
 
 The president of   and others, meanwhile, submitted a memorandum to the district collector against the razing drive by VMC. The memorandum alleged that it was his responsibility to take care of the properties of the panchayat. He claimed that some material stored by the panchayat in the premises was also damaged. He claimed that the VMC had damaged the property of the panchayat and should compensate it for the damage.
 
 Patel has also raised the issue of   that was in the possession of the panchayat. He said this was a heritage structure and was also included in a recent list of such buildings in the city.
