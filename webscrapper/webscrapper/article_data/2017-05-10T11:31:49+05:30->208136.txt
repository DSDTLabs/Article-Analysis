 arrived in Mumbai last night at 1:30 am and the fans went absolutely crazy with his presence. The International music sensation is going to perform in India as a part of his ‘Purpose Tour’ for the first time ever. 

 However, it was a shocker when the media and the guests left an important event mid-way to cover Justin Bieber’s arrival in the bay.
 
 As per a close source present there, half the press and the guests left the event where music maestro AR. Rahman was still performing. They clearly did not think that the performance of the Oscar-winning music composer was important enough to sit through it till the end.
 
 It was utterly disrespectful of the press and the guests to just walk away midway of the event which was so important for the Indian fans. 
 
 Justin Bieber will be taking the city by storm this evening with a bunch of   celebrities sharing the stage with him. The event is said to start at 4 pm today at DY Patil Stadium, Navi Mumbai.
