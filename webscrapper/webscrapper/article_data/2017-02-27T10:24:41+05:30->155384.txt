NAVI MUMBAI: The Kharghar police on Sunday arrested one worker of a food stall outside a hotel in   complex. Several people have reportedly fallen sick after having food at the stall.

 However, Panvel city municipal corporation's commissioner Sudhakar Shinde has questioned the Kharghar police as to why no appropriate legal action was taken against the owner of the hotel and the food stall's vendor.
 
 “On Sunday, I visited Niramay hospital in Kharghar where a student of   college was admitted. She said she had fallen sick after eating dinner at the stall outside the hotel and has claimed that though the food was served at the stall, it was cooked inside the hotel. Hence, the hotel owner needs to be held responsible. The student's food poisoning has worsened to typhoid,“ Shinde told TOI.
