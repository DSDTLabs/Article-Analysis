Chennai: Censuring the police for their inaction over a complaint lodged against actor and BJP leader   for his controversial social media post defaming women journalists, the Madras high court reserved its order on the anticipatory bail application moved by him.

 “Why has no action been taken against him so far? When the department takes immediate action on complaints filed against the general public, why partiality is shown in taking action on this complaint,” asked Justice S Ramathilagam on Thursday.
 
 To this, the counsel representing those opposing relief to the actor, said the police were acting in a biased manner since Shekher was a relative of the Tamil Nadu chief secretary. However, denying bias or partiality, the police told the court that they had sought the details of the original post of Shekher from  , since it has now been deleted.
 
 In his petition, Shekher submitted that he was not the author of the post and that he did not know its contents when he “forwarded” it after receiving it from his Facebook friend Thirumalai Sa.
 
 Pointing out the case registered by the cybercrime cell of the police had IPC sections, including those related to intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, statements conducive to mischief, promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will and any word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman, he said the case had been registered by making baseless allegations as though he had defamed the whole media fraternity, in particular outraging the modesty of women. There is no iota of truth in it, he said.
