HYDERABAD: A woman masquerading as a doctor slipped into   to meet her fiance's relative during non-visiting hours on Thursday. 

 
 The couple   (32) and   (25), residents of New Bowenpally, went to the hospital at 11.30am, when visitors are not allowed entry.
 
 When the security guard,  , stopped the couple,   claimed to be a doctor working at the hospital.
 
 "Rizwana said she is a doctor and should be allowed entry. When the security guard was not convinced, Rizwana showed a stethoscope and a white coat which usually doctors use. She claimed to work in labour ward of the hospital to further convince the guard," said inspector Bharath of Chilkalguda police station on Thursday. 
 
 Though the guard allowed the couple entry, he got suspicious. The guard followed them and found they were not going to labour department, rather going towards the burns ward. Pradeep then confronted the two and called the police.
 
 "The couple wanted to meet Kareem's relative, who was admitted on Wednesday. Kareem's relative had attempted to commit suicide by setting herself ablaze and was admitted with 90% burns. The duo wanted to meet her," said the police.
 
 Rizwana had recently completed her nursing course, said police. The police did not file any complaint and the couple was let off after the clarification.
