Singer   said he and brother   are rivals when they work out. 
The singer said it is a friendly competition to give each other an extra push.
 
  
  
 "There's definitely a rivalry -- there's no question. We just like giving each other that push. That community really helps. It creates a really good energy. So Joe and I are really embracing that gym culture," Nick said. 
 
 The "Jealous" hitmaker said his 27-year-old brother makes for a good work out partner as they are both pursing different goals with their exercise regimes. 
 
 "There are areas where Joe really excels and other where I really excel. I just hate cardio and Joe really loves it. He likes to run and do other things like that. For me, I like to push myself with pushing heaving weight and doing that stuff. 
 
 "It's fun. It's nice to have that type of balance. A little brotherly competition (sic)" he said.
