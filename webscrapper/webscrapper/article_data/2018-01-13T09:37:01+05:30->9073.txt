VASCO: Chief minister   on Friday said that the Union government can look at Italy, Russia and South   for transfer for technology (ToT) to build 12 mine counter measure vessels (MCMV) for the Indian   at the Goa Shipyard Ltd ( ). The total cost of the project is Rs 32,000 crore.

 Parrikar was speaking to reporters after laying the foundation stone for the mine counter measure vessel command and control design centre at GSL, which is part of the minesweeper project.
 
 He said the Navy requires new minesweepers and that only one part of the minesweeper project has been cancelled. As such this would not cause the entire project to be delayed, the CM added. 
 
 Parrikar said GSL delivers most ships ahead of time. GSL should start on the minesweeper project as early as possible, he said, adding that the project’s infrastructure is already touching Rs 13,000 crore. 
 
 The Navy has given the money for creating the ecosystem required for the project and the same should be developed indigenously, preferable in Goa, the CM said.
 
 Chairman and managing director GSL Shekhar   said all speculations the minesweeper project getting cancelled should be put to rest. “ The ministry of defence is fully committed to implementing the minesweeper project through GSL at the earliest,” he said.
