NEW DELHI: Delhi Chief Minister   today said his party will abolish the   and waive off arrears if voted to power in the capital's civic bodies, as he sought to aggressively woo voters ahead of the April 23 polls.
 
  Kejriwal contended that the house tax has become a "major" source of corruption and promised that his party, which is making its civic polls debut, will end it.
  
  He vowed to transform the three civic corporations in the national capital into "profit-making" bodies. Two of the bodies -- the New Delhi Municipal Council and East Delhi Municipal Corporation -- are currently grappling with financial losses.
  
  Taking a dig at the ruling  , the chief minister said its councillors could be seen travelling on scooters before the previous MCD elections, but are now zooming around in expensive cars.
  
  He also promised that the   will ensure that municipal staffers get their salaries on time.
  
  "We will abolish the residential house tax and waive off tax arrears if AAP comes to power...the party is preparing its detailed manifesto which will be released soon," he told reporters here.
  
  The residential house tax is an important source of revenue for civic bodies.
  
  Kejriwal added that the commercial house tax will continue to be in place.
  
  To a question on allegations by political rivals that the AAP always announces freebies ahead of the polls, Kejriwal said the Delhi government is saving money on its projects which is then spent on public welfare.
  
  The three municipal corporations -- SDMC, NDMC and EDMC -- go to polls on April 23, while votes will be counted on April 26.
