HYDERABAD: The   (NHRC) has issued a notice to Telangana government taking   of the plight of the 14-year-old HIV/AIDS afflicted boy reported in these columns on Wednesday.

 Diagnosed with full-blown Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( ), the boy was made to shuttle to and fro to four state-run hospitals for treatment within a period of 24 hours along with his aged grandmother.
 
 In its notice issued to the chief secretary, Telangana, the NHRC called for a report in the matter within six week time, while quoting the TOI report verbatim in its notice. “It is not an isolated incident as denial of treatment to HIV patients commonly occur but they never come to light. In one way, the government hospitals are far better compared to the open discrimination practiced by corporate hospitals in such cases,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, president,  .
 
 However, in its notice, the NHRC sought explanation why instead of initiating treatment of the patient, ‘they made them run from one hospital to the other’. Meanwhile, the 14-year-old boy is awaiting an appointment with gastroenterologist and a neurologist at   (OGH) before the state run Chest hospital’s Antiretroviral Therapy(ART) centre can start his treatment with drugs.
 
 More than ART drugs, the boy seems to be in immediate need of hospitalisation, requiring expert help from a multi-disciplinary team of doctors as he has been diagnosed with HIV induced dementia, according to the discharge report written by NIMS hospital doctors on Monday. “He is critically ill and may not survive unless he gets immediate attention ,”added Mustaba Hasan.
