LUDHIANA: Against fears of technical glitches, the first day of e-way bill system for supply of goods above Rs 50,000 to other states remained normal on Sunday. However, city businessmen attributed it to less load on official portal (www.ewaybillgst.gov.in) as transactions' number was limited due to the holiday. 

 They said efficiency of the system could be judged on a working day, and if the government wanted the e-way bill system to work smoothly, it should come out with alternatives for bill generation like a mobile app.
 
 Jasmeet Singh Prince, president of Ludhiana Transport Welfare Association, said, "The processing was slow, but e-way bills were being generated unlike the last time when the site crashed. Today being Sunday could be one of the reasons for the site to work fine. Real efficiency to handle huge number of transactions can be gauged only on working days."
 
 According to  , a member of  , "I was easily able to generate e-way bill for a consignment that I had to send urgently to Delhi. However, I am doubtful whether the online system will run as smoothly as today when there was hardly any movement of goods."
 
 Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers' Association, Ludhiana said, "Considering a high number of users in every state, the e-way bill system will not work efficiently and smoothly until the government launches a mobile app or comes up with some more alternatives to generate e-way bills. At present, there is only one means of generation of bills and that is through the official e-way bill web portal."
 
 Pawan Garg, deputy excise and taxation commissioner ( ), Ludhiana, said, "From April 1, e-way bill system was started all over the country and it functioned smoothly. Considering it is a new system for our registered dealers and transporters, we have deputed three ETO-level officers for resolving any issues they might face."
