Indian actors, let alone TV actors, rarely do the full monty on screen. However,   is an exception to the rule. Last seen in the TV show ' ', Shravan has done a nude scene for Ramman Handa’s short film titled 'Karma'. He says, “I was apprehensive about going nude for the film in the beginning, but I decided to understand the relevance of the scene, the director’s vision and the target audience. My director explained the character’s state of mind and the decisions he would make. Also, it is targeted at the international audience, which is what made me agree to do such a scene. Honestly, it may sound titillating to the rest, but shooting in the nude is no fun, honestly.”
Ask him if he altered his diet to up the oomph factor before the shoot and he replies, “Not much, because the character is a regular guy, who might not necessarily look extremely fit. However, I just went low on carbs and cut down my water intake.”
