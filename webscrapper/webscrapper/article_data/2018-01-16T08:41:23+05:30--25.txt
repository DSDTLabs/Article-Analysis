AHMEDABAD: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) activists who had gathered at the three-storeyed Paldi head office of   in Ahmedabad were relieved when news broke that VHP leader   was admitted in a hospital in Shahibaug area in an unconscious state. Shouts of   rent the air in jubilation. Earlier in the day, many VHP workers were seen terribly worried about their missing leader.

 VHP activists blamed the BJP-led governments of Gujarat and Rajasthan for Togadia’s disappearance, and some threatened of dire consequences if anything happened to him. Since afternoon the youth brigade of VHP had begun to gather at the head office. Some of them even blocked an AMTS bus and traffic at Paldi crossroads.
 
 “Police intervention had brought the situation under control. A heavy police deployment followed soon after a few activists blocked traffic,” said a senior police official. Tensions had heightened after Ashok Sharma, Gujarat president of Hindu   had rushed to the VHP office with his co-workers and threatened to intensify the agitation if the state government did not find Togadia by Tuesday.
 
 “Pravin bhai had Z-plus security and he was not a petty criminal. The state government should clarify if he had been arrested either by Rajasthan police or Gujarat police, or must be ready to face intensified agitation,” said Sharma.
