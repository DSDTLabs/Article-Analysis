Puducherry: The Puducherry police on Wednesday solved a   case within 12 hours of the crime, by arresting the accused, a 24-year-old B Tech graduate. 

 The arrested was identified as J Giridharan from Arumparthapuram. Deputy inspector general of police (law and order) Rajiv Ranjan said, P Deepa , 36, wife of Prabhudoss was found strangulated to death at her house on Tuesday. Acting on a complaint, a police team led by superintendent of police (north) Rachna Singh began investigations and managed to trace the accused, a  , and nabbed him after laying a trap.
 
 Ranjan said the accused had noticed that the couple, both working in a BPO unit, had the habit of leaving behind their house key beneath the doormat before heading out. 
 
 Similarly, on Tuesday morning, the accused saw Deepa leave home and gained entry into the house using the key hid under the mat, planning to steal money and valuables to compensate the losses he had incurred while investing in the stock market. 
 
 He was searching for some money when Deepa returned home after visiting a nearby shop. While Deepa was startled to see her house open with her neighbour inside, fearing she will expose his bid to steal, Giridharan attacked Deepa with a DVD player and smashed her head into a wall before strangulating her to death. He also sprinkled chilli powder in the scene of crime in an effort to suppress evidence. On being traced down, Ranjan said the accused confessed to the murder. Police have also recovered blood stained clothes from the accused. The arrested was produced before a local court and remanded in judicial custody.
