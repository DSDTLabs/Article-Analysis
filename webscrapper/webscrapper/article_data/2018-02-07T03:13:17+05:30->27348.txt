Ghaziabad: The Union enviroment ministry on Tuesday refused to give environmental clearance (EC) to the   ( ) for its UP Gate to Rajnagar Extension elevated road project. 

 The ministry, in turn, has asked GDA to seek clearance from the   Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).
 
 Confirming the development, GDA vice-chairperson Ritu Maeshwari told TOI, “We were pursuing the matter for seeking environmental clearance from the Union environment ministry for the elevated road project in accordance with NGT’s orders, but the ministry has asked us to seek clearance from the SEIAA instead. The matter will be now referred to the state green agency and we hope to get a clearance within a fortnight or so.”
 
 Work on the 10.3km, six-lane Hindon elevated road is complete, but its inauguration is held up as the GDA has been pursuing the matter with the Union environment ministry.
 
 In 2016, a city-based environmentalist, Sushil Raghav, filed a petition in the NGT, alleging that a portion of the elevated road was being built on land classified as Hindon bird sanctuary, and that at least three of its pillars were passing through land marked as ‘lake’ in revenue records. Following the petition, the court stayed the work on this section in July that year.
 
 Raghav, meanwhile, said that it will hardly dilute his case. “Be it the Union environment ministry or the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, the ground on which the case would be decided will be based on Environment Impact Assessment notification 2006. So, I don’t think that it would make any difference to the outcome of the case,” he added. 
 
 In January this year, the NGT directed GDA to seek environmental clearance from the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change in one month.
