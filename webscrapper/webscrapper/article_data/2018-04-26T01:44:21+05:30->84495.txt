Singer  , who has tracks like ' ', 'Jee karda' and 'Raita phail gaya' to his credit, says singer   does full justice to every song he sings.

 Divya spoke about his admiration for Arijit, on having a mentor in Bollywood and more, on the second season of audio and music streaming service audio show, read a statement.
 
 "Arijit is God to me because the kind of voice that he has, nobody else does. He is actually a proper learned classical singer, with very well-developed vocals. He is a proper educated musician. We are just singing songs, but there isn't a single song which Arijit hasn't done justice to. He does full justice to every song he sings. I think till now Arijit Singh's talent isn't completely out in the open," said Divya.
 
 "When he sings ghazals, it's a treat. He focuses on every minute detail. It's not like show off singing," Kumar added. 
 
 He considers composer   his mentor.
 
 "Shalmali Kholgade and I both made our debut with 'Ishaqzaade' and Amit Trivedi gave us a chance. I believe Amit Trivedi is my mentor," said Divya, who belongs to a family of musicians. He is the grandson of composer Pandit Shivram and son of musician Bhagwan Shivram.
 
 He said singer   introduced him to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy.
 
 "I can say that composers Gulraj Singh and Amit Trivedi are people who gave me a break to sing in movies. That is a very big step because these were big movies and to give a new voice an opportunity to sing in them, is huge," he added.
 
 The episode with Divya was made available on the music app on Wednesday.
