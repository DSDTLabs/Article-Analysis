BHOPAL: Supreme Court’s decision to cancel 634 admissions of medical students for resorting to unfair means, has in fact, impacted 1087 students. Dream of these 1087 students who took admission between 2009 and 2013 came crashing on Monday. Welcoming the decision of the apex court, Vyapam’s director, Bhaskar Lakshakar said the decision vindicates Vyapam stand. Senior lawyer Mehmood Pracha said the decision is applicable on other students also if their case is similar.

 “Facts should be the same for applicability on other students on the basis of which the entrance test was cancelled,” said Pracha. Lakshakar told TOI that apex court decision came on the plea by students. “After the scam surfaced in 2013, Vyapam cancelled the entrance test of 1087 students over three counts in 2014. These included using- different ink, engine-bogey system for cheating and miscellaneous like tampering with admit cards. Out of these 1087 students, 634 students moved MP high court to challenge the decision of Vyapam,” said Lakshakar.
 
 Students lost the case in the high court. “After losing the case in 2015, 144 students moved Supreme Court. As the apex court upheld the decision of the high court the admissions of 634 students stands cancelled,” he said.He made it clear that entrance test of remaining 453 students’ would also be treated like these 634 students. “All 1087 students’ entrance test was cancelled on the same ground so it applies uniformly to all,” said Lakshakar.“Their entrance tests were cancelled on different instances from 2009 to 2013,” said Lakshakar.Vyapam has been facing accusations of fraud since 2009, but the big revelation came in June 2013 when a racket that helped students pass their pre-medical tests was busted. This racket was led by a doctor and aided by a few Vyapam officials.
 
 Dr Anand Rai, an activist based in Indore had filed a PIL indicating corruption in Vyapam that prompted the MP High Court order a special investigation in July 2013.
