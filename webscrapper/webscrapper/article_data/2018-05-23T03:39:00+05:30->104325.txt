Panaji: Goa will host the National Award Winning   Festival, wherein 23 films of 13 regional languages that have won a national award this year will be screened. 

 The festival is being organised by the directorate of film festivals in association with the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) from May 25 to June 7 at Maquinez Palace in Panaji.
 
 “Attending a festival with such a diverse range of regional language films will help the Goan filmmakers grow. We will soon have workshops as well so that the Goan film fraternity can learn more about films,” said vice-chairman of ESG, Rajendra Talak.
 
 The Marathi films, Kaacha Limbu, directed by Prasad Oak, which won the award for best regional film, and Pavasacha Nibandha, directed by Nagraj Manjule which won the award for best audiography, will be screened on the inaugural day of the festival at 6pm in auditorium 1 of Maquinez Palace.
 
 Oak and Manjule will be present at the inaugural and will interact with attendees following the screening of their respective films. 
 
 For the closing ceremony, the Assamese film Village Rockstars, will be screened. Its director Rima Das, will also be present for a question and answer session with the audience.
 
 Incidentally, Kaacha Limbu and Village Rockstars besides Newton were screened at Iffi last year.
 
 “No other state in India sees the screening of national award-winning films except Delhi and Goa. This is a great opportunity for film lovers to watch films that have been bestowed with national awards this year,” said executive member of ESG, Sachin Chatte.
 
 Of the 23 films that will be screened at the festival, four are Malayalam language films while there are three each in Hindi and Marathi, besides other languages. 
 
 The screening is open to all on first-come-first-serve basis. However, since some of the films have an adult certificate, entry will strictly depend on the censor rating of the film.
