NEW DELHI: The   (SEC) on Monday opposed fledgling party Swaraj India’s plea seeking a common symbol to contest upcoming municipal polls.

 It submitted before Delhi high court that there are several parties in the category of Swaraj India which are registered but unrecognised and have not been given a common symbol.
 
 Appearing for the   panel, advocate Sumeet Pushkarna argued before Justice Hima Kohli that there is no reason why “such preference should be given to Swaraj India.” He further informed the court that state EC is only implementing directions issued by the Centre which alone has the power to change rules.
 
 The commission argued that the petition filed by Swaraj India is not maintanable since it doesn’t challenge the March 14 notification which bars grant of a common symbol to candidates of unrecognised but registered parties.
 
 But the party, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, maintained it has challenged the March 14 notification and assailed the state EC’s refusal to grant it a common symbol.
 
 In its plea, Swaraj India has also sought quashing of the SEC’s April 2016 notification, which said the nominees of registered but unrecognised parties will be treated as independent candidates for allotment of symbols. The civic polls are scheduled for April 22. The party alleged that the Delhi symbol order by state EC is “wholly illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and selective, destroying the very fairness of the proposed electoral process itself”.
 
 It has argued that providing a common symbol will create a level playing field between all the parties, whether recognised or not, and ensure free and fair elections.
