Madurai: It has been three months since the   ( ) acquired licence for the transplantation of organs like heart and lungs. However, there is not a single patient in the waitlist to receive such organs in the hospital.

  While organs such as kidneys, liver and cornea were harvested from brain dead S Nagaraj recently, the vital organs such as lungs and heart were not harvested. They were allotted for a couple of hospitals in Chennai, but both of them were not in a position to carry them in the absence flight facility at odd hours. 
 
 However, had there been a few people registered for the organs, someone found matching the organs could have got it. S Venkatesh, transplant counsellor from Transtan in GRH said that he has been looking for prospective receivers of organs such as heart and lungs, along with the departments like cardiology and cardio thoracic, but could not find one.
 
 He cites lack of awareness about the available facility as the reason, and that is why people are running behind private hospitals in Chennai. Transtan, the nodal agency for organ transplantation maintains a list of recipients. As per norms, the hospital, which performs the   gets priority in getting the organs. 
 
 The hospitals in Chennai find it impossible to transport them at night time resulting in wasting them. 
 
 “With the GRH having started organ harvesting from brain dead, locals can approach it for heart and lungs transplantation. Transplantation of heart and lungs would generally cost more than Rs 30 lakh in private hospitals. It can be done for free in GRH,” Venkatesh said. 
 
 C Anandaraj insisted that doctors in the GRH should take the responsibility of identifying those who require heart and lung transplantation and help them register with Transtan. 
 
 Most of the patients visiting GRH would be poor ones, and they might not be knowing about the transplantation, he said.
