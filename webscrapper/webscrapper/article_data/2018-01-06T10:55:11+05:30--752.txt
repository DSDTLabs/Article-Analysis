LUCKNOW: Reacting to TOI’s report published on Friday that   are being mostly lit in  ,   has been asked to explain where exactly it has   and what measures have been taken to ensure that bonfires are equally distributed across the city.

 Basing her query on TOI’s front-page report, mayor   wrote to the municipal commissioner on Friday asking why there was a bias in distributing firewood among the poor.
 
 She said she had been asking for the said details for the past four days as the weather became colder but had got no response from LMC officials. Her letter seeks minute details from officials like which points they have earmarked for bonfires and how much firewood is being distributed.
 
 Bhatia said, “I was also getting complaints from people that the wood LMC is giving for bonfires is either green or wet. Hence, shelterless people are finding it difficult to burn it. I have also asked for investigation into why LMC is supplying damp wood.”
 
 While cold conditions have intensified over the past week, LMC continues to provide wood only at around 365 points.
 
 After TOI reported that bonfire points were not sufficient, LMC increased the points to 450 on Friday evening.
 
 Municipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh said, “We will provide a list of bonfire points to the mayor soon. We have also sought explanations from officials on why damp wood was being supplied. I will also speak to the forest department on the same.”
