Mumbai:   has received the go-ahead from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to enter the asset reconstruction business and will have full ownership of its arm. 

 Indiabulls Asset Reconstructions, a wholly owned subsidiary of   (IVL), is the first   (ARC) in the country to receive regulatory nod under the new 100% ownership rule that was allowed in last year’s Budget. Earlier, sponsors of ARCs could hold only up to 50% in the arm. The government, aiming for greater and experienced participation, has also allowed 100% FDI in the sector.
 
 An Indiabulls Group spokesperson confirmed the regulatory nod for its ARC arm. Indiabulls is entering the ARC sector at a time when several global players are also eyeing the market, with the banking industry’s total bad loans estimated at about Rs 12 lakh crore. 
 
 Indiabulls’s ARC arm would be competing with leading names in the sector like  ,   and  . Recently, the Canadian pension fund CDPQ acquired a 20% stake in Edelweiss ARC, valuing it at about $1 billion. Several other leading names in the financial sector also have plans to enter this segment.
 
 Currently, the RBI as also the government are looking for solutions that could turn around companies which have declared bad loans, rather than stripping their assets and selling them off. The new ARC regulations have also been tightened, requiring them to pay at least 50% of the purchase price to banks in cash. These new rules have also made this business more capital-intensive, industry players said.
