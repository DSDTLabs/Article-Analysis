MUMBAI: Parents of a former student of  , Chembur, who was allegedly slapped by his English teacher in 2015, say they are still “waiting for closure“ in the case.They plan to write to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights demanding that an order in the case be passed at the earliest.

 In October 2015, the 13-year-old's parents had filed a police complaint and moved the education department after the teacher allegedly slapped the Class IX student repeatedly for not buttoning his uniform's collar. The case was then taken up by the child rights commission as well.“The commission heard all sides but we are still waiting for its final orders. We have been following up with police too, but they also are waiting for the orders,“ said Amit Singh, the boy's father.
 
 A few months after the incident, the student was suspended.His parents alleged that it was because of the complaint. “The school's top officials threatened our son in front of several students. Teachers also asked classmates to speak against our son. This is not how a corporal punishment complaint is handled. We had to move him out to another school and change our daughter's school too. Even today when we think of the episode, we feel scared. School authorities did not take any action against the teacher. Though our son is out of the school, we want justice.“ A rights commission official said the case is pending for order and can be expected shortly . Despite repeated attempts, Neti Srinivasan, school COO, couldn't be reached.
