VEIN PUIN (TARN TARAN): Despite a spate of resignations and outburst of resentment by several  , party’s newly-appointed state unit president   chose to remain quiet during his visit to   in   on Wednesday, where he had arrived to condole the death of Naib Subedar Paramjit Singh on occasion of the martyr’s  

 Skirting questions regarding resignation by AAP’s former Punjab convener Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi and Lok Sabha byelection candidate from Amritsar Upkar Singh Sandhu, besides resentment by other AAP leaders on his appointment, Mann said it was not the right time to discuss politics since he was there to share grief of the family of the martyr and to console them.
 
 However, he was critical of chief minister Amarinder Singh, stating that he had promised to give jobs to martyr’s kin after they would complete their education. He opined that the compensation and other help should be given now. “Who knows which political party will be in power then and who will keep the promise made now by the Congress government,” he added. AAP Punjab vice-president Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said that Sangrur MP Mann had announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh from his discretionary funds.
 
 While Mann was mum over a volley of charges levelled against him, his deputy Dhaliwal was vocal in saying that the resignations and opposition to the Sangrur MP’s appointment was not from volunteers but from a few leaders. “None of the party volunteer had expressed resentment, but a few leaders, especially those who had vested interests,” he maintained. Dhaliwal claimed that AAP’s centre leadership had adopted a democratic way before finalising the name of Mann. “Not only MLAs but zone in-charges, senior leaders and volunteers from state were consulted before taking a final call,” he quipped.
 
 On the incidents of killing of Indian soldiers at the border, he said that the Union government should stop condemning the incidents and teach Pakistan a lesson in the language it understands.
