MUMBAI: Four RTI activists on Wednesday filed a complaint with   (ACB), demanding criminal proceedings against chief minister  , PWD minister Eknath Shinde and   officials. 

  These four activists have been pressing for stopping of toll collection for Mumbai-Pune expressway, following alleged 'full' recovery of   and profits by the contractor (IRB   Developers). 
 
 According to them Fadnavis and MSRDC machinery was allegedly allowing wrongful collection of toll over and above the cash flow agreed between the contractor and the government, which, according to them amounts to corruption.
 
 If ACB fails to register an FIR, activists - Vivek Velankar, Pravin Wategaonkar, Sanjay Shirodkar, and Shrinivas Ghanekar said, they will approach the court in 45 days. 
 
 A senior MSRDC official clarified that almost half of the contract period went in recovering compounding interest on loan and remaining half to repay the principal amount with a smaller period earning contractor some profits.
 
  IRB, in its clarification, said: "... assuming that the projects recovery is already done is completely wrong."
