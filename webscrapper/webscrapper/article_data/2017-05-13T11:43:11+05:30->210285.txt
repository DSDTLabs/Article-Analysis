PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( ) has proposed to construct an iron bridge on   river so the 21,000 residents of Bopkhel village have access to the neighbouring Khadki Cantonment Board ( ). 

 This is a temporary arrangement until a permanent bridge is built, said municipal commissioner Shravan  .
 
 Elaborating, Hardikar said, “The PCMC has sent the design of the permanent bridge to defence authorities for final approval. Once approved, we will invite bids from contractors. That process will take two-three months. The monsoon will set in next month, rendering construction impossible. So we will complete the tender process when it’s raining.”
 
 He said construction of the permanent bridge will further take two-three years after the work order is issued.
 
 “The   does not have a pontoon or temporary bridge now. Even so, a pontoon bridge cannot be used in the monsoon. Hence the proposal to built an iron bridge,” he said. 
 
 The civic body will request the district collector to organize a meeting of officials from PCMC, defence and other departments concerned to take a decision about the iron bridge. “We need every department’s approval,” Hardikar said.
 
 Meanwhile Shrikant Ghule, member of Bopkhelgaon Rasta Sangharsha Samiti, concurred. “The permission of the defence authorities is needed for people and vehicles to pass through defence areas.”
 
 Ever since the pontoon bridge was removed by defence authorities a year ago, the local residents — students, workers and others — have had to travel an additional six to eight kilometres, spending extra time and money, to reach their respective destinations.
