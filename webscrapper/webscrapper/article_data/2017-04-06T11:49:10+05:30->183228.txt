The April 7 meeting that was to be led by Amit Shah was part of the 17 Lok Sabha constituency wise meetings in Telangana that the party planned as a first step towards strengthening its presence at the ground level in all constituencies in the state.
 
 BJP sources said that a last minute National Democratic Alliance coordination committee meeting that came up on April 7 resulted in Amit Shah putting off his Hyderabad trip. “A new date will be finalised in a day or two,” a party leader said on Thursday morning.
 
 The NDA coordination committee, it is learnt, is scheduled to discuss possible candidates for the President of India and Vice-President of India elections that are due in the middle of this year.
 
 As per the original plan, Amit Shah was to arrive here in the city on the morning of April 7. He was to address a meeting of BJP committees, starting from booth level committees upwards at the Exhibition Grounds in Nampally. He was to stay overnight in the city and leave the next morning.
 
 The state unit of the BJP had been eagerly looking forward to Amit Shah’s visit to provide a fillip to the party leaders and workers. “The meeting will be rescheduled and will be held at Exhibition Grounds. It is just a matter a couple of days or so before it happens,” a party leader said.
