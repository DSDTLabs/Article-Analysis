KANPUR: Coming down heavily on  's statement wherein he announced to float a new party after election results on March 11, senior SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav, who was in Etawah on Wednesday said, "It's not that easy to form a political party...it seems some people have lost their consciousness. There are hundreds of such parties registered with EC ( ). Some get 50 while others 100 votes. When one forms a new party, he/she also loses his/her membership."

 Former state SP chief Shivpal Yadav on Tuesday had hinted that he might form a new party after March 11 after election results were announced. "You make the government, and I will form a new party when results of Assembly elections will be declared," he had stated at a meeting in Etawah--the pocket borough of Yadav clan, after filing nomination papers from his traditional Jaswantnagar seat on SP ticket.
 
 Ram Gopal further said that the candidates pitted against authorised SP candidates will get only 100 to 200 votes. "Once the election results are declared, they will themselve come to know about their real 'position'," he said while seeking votes from advocate groups at the district court for party candidate Kuldeep Gupta alias Santu contesting for Etawah Sadar seat. 
 
 While garnering support for Kuldeep, Ram Gopal said, "Before starting campaigning, one usually visit a temple, but I have always believed in starting campaigning from a court because lawyers not only act as a shield to save many, but also capable of damaging anyone's prospects". 
 
 Speaking over SP-Congress alliance, Ram Gopal said that the alliance had been formed after consent of top leaders of SP and Congress parties. “It has come into existence after obtaining the consent of both Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi and Evey SP worker is toiling hard to retain power,” he said.
