After completing this work, footpaths would be laid along the stretch between Collector’s Office Junction and Finger Post Junction by May,” said  , assistant divisional engineer, state highways (national wing).
 
 Meanwhile, the state highways has started to relay the 2km stretch of Commercial Road from   to main bus stand junction (near railway station entrance).
