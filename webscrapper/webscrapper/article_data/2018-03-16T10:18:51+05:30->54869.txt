CHENNAI: A toddler died early on Thursday when he fell out of an SUV window and the vehicle crushed him after it hit a median, flipped over and careened into a roadside pit near   in Kancheepuram, 100km southwest of the city.

 Traffic police officers probing the accident said one-and-a-half-year-old Darshan was one of two small children in the SUV. The vehicle was carrying a total of nine people when a sudden flat tyre caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle.
 
 “Thayagaraj, 30, was on his way from   to Chennai to attend a family function with his wife and their child, Darshan, and their relatives,” an officer said. “As the SUV approached a turn on a bypass near Acharapakkam in the early hours of Thursday, one of its front tyres burst. Kasi, 50, the driver, lost grip of the steering wheel.”
 
 Darshan’s parents, who survived the accident with minor injuries, told the police that the child was sleeping when he fell out of the vehicle.
 
 “After the SUV collided with the median and snaked off the road, it rolled over and landed on the boy,” the officer said.
 
 Other motorists halted and tried to rescue the vehicle’s occupants. They took them to  , where doctors pronounced Darshan dead.
 
 “Darshan’s parents and relatives in the vehicle who were awake were horrified by what they had witnessed,” the officer said. “They said the child fell through a window of the SUV as it tumbled into a pit.”
 
 Policemen soon arrived at the accident spot but could not extricate Darshan from under the SUV. They had to wait for a crane, which lifted the vehicle out of the pit, exposing the child’s mangled body.
 
 “Kasi, the driver, sustained serious injuries,” the officer said. “The other occupants only had bruises and doctors have treated them.”
 
 The Archarapakm police said doctors at Chengalpet Government Hospital will perform an autopsy on the body.
 
 The police registered a case under IPC Section 304 (A) (causing death due to negligence).
