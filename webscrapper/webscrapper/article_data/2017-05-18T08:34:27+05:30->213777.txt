CHANDIGARH: Where there is a will, there is a way, goes the adage. And former Haryana chief minister   seems to personify it. Belying the age factor, Chautala (82) serving a 10-year   in Delhi’s Tihar jail after his conviction in the junior basic trained (JBT) teacher   in 2000, has cleared the Class XII examinations under the aegis of the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). 

 And an emboldened INLD supremo now wants to be a graduate and has asked his grandson Digvijay Singh Chautala to make arrangements for books and forms. “He has always led by example. His message is simple that there is no age limit for education, which is the most essential asset of a person. You will be surprised that he also motivated others in the jail,” said the octogenarian five-time CM’s son and leader of opposition  .
 
 As per information, Chautala took the examination last month in the jail. Sources informed that Chautala, who was given a month’s parole to attend his grandson Dushyant Singh Chautala’s wedding, opted to return to jail before the parole ended to appear in the examination.
 
 Officials in Tihar jail said Chautala was among those prominent convicts who had resumed their education or completed courses conducted by the NIOS set up in 1989. Chautala and his elder son Ajay Singh Chautala and 50 others were charged with corruption in the recruitment scam involving 3,206 JBT teachers in Haryana in 2000. They were convicted by a trial court in 2013, which was upheld by the Supreme Court.
