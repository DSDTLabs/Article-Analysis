While environmentalists and activists in the city are upbeat about the plans to rejuvenate local lakes and canals, they are apprehensive about the civic body’s ability to check discharge of sewage into the water bodies.

 “None of the projects announced by the city corporation will be successful until they stop sewage from entering canals and lakes. The proposed walkways and bicycle tracks may look beautiful, but water will continue to stink and the areas will remain filthy if garbage and sewage disposal issues along the water bodies are not resolved,” city-based environmentalist   said.
 
 R Manikandan of   said that over the years, all political parties had announced lake rejuvenation projects. “Be it DMK or  , all politicians had proposed many projects. As environmentalists, our only concern is that the bunds need to be protected. They can build anything in a scientific manner, provided, the sewage is treated before being let into the water bodies. Instead of roads, natural treatment of sewage should be undertaken there. There should be smaller channels created around the canal and water should be treated,” he told TOI.
 
 If roads are laid around every canal and lake, maintenance of the water bodies will be a problem, a former public works department engineer said. “Such roads might look beautiful. However, before starting such projects, expert opinion should be sought and environmentalists should be involved in the process. More than a decade has passed since the corporation took over the city lakes. These same promises were made then. A decade has passed and nothing has materialised. At least this time, we hope these projects will see the daylight,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, corporation officials said that   project is not about beautification. “The main project proposal is about cleaning the canal and maintaining it. Also, reducing traffic congestion by creating a pathway around the canal for vehicles and pedestrians,” corporation commissioner   said.
