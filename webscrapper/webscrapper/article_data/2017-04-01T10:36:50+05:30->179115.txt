MARGAO: Frequent   on a daily basis have now become a regular phenomenon for the   with   going on and off more than a dozen times a day.

 When contacted,   (AE), Raju Karnal, told TOI, “This problem of power interruptions is due to the failure of the incoming power supply from the neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Karnataka – the   (MSEB) and Karnataka electricity board (KEB). As a result of the additional load in the summers, we are being forced to undertake load-shedding measures. 
 
 Since we receive the power supply from Ponda power station, we receive instructions from the Ponda officials to restrict the load being provided to the industrial units situated in the Cuncolim and Verna industrial estates.”
