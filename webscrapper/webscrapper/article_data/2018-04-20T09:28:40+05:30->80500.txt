HYDERABAD: K  , the fourth additional metropolitan sessions judge, who quit after pronouncing the verdict in the  , resumed duties on Thursday and also requested the   to allow him to take voluntary retirement, apparently to avail retirement benefits. 

 Ravinder Reddy had put in his papers citing "personal reasons", barely hours after acquitting right-wing activist   and five others in the   blast case on April 16.
 
 However, the HC found that his representation seeking voluntary retirement wasn't filed in the proper format. The AP Pension rules make it mandatory for all those who want to avail voluntary retirement to file their representation by giving three months' notice. 
 
 Reddy would attain the age of 58 in June 2018 and would retire in normal course unless a two-year extension is given to him. However, such an extension is not automatic and involves a review and assessment by the HC. Though the judge didn't have the three-month service left to fulfil the norm, it is within the discretion of the HC to consider such a case, sources said. 
 
 Reddy was among the 11 subordinate court judges who were suspended by the HC in June 2016 for protesting against appointment of the judges from Andhra Pradesh to courts in Telangana. 
 
 
 
 
 The suspension was, however, revoked in the subsequent month.
 
 On Thursday, the HC suspended two more district judges facing charges of corruption. S Radhakrishna Murthy, second additional metropolitan sessions judge at Hyderabad Criminal Courts Complex, Nampally, was placed under suspension. Similarly, K Ranga Rao, special judge in Mahbubnagar, was placed under suspension. Acting on a complaint by lawyers questioning some of Raoâ€™s verdicts, an HC inquiry found that the allegations were true.
