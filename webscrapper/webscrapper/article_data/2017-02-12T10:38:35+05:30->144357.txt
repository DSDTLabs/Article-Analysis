MUMBAI: Even as   & Co. go about their business against a courageous Bangladesh outfit in the lone Test at Hyderabad, cricket fans are already waiting for the four-match Test series against Australia that begins on February 23. And, few players across generations, have enjoyed the sort of success against the Aussies that former captain   did during his illustrious career.

 So, what does the man credited with instilling the priceless qualities of self-belief and aggression in the Indian team while he was at the helm, think of the forthcoming face-off?
 
 "Well, Australia are going to find it difficult to win here," the 44-year-old told TOI, on the sidelines of an event organised to launch a new range of Tetley Super Green Teas on Saturday. "It's hard to beat India in India. There could not have been a much stronger side than the one that toured India in 2001 and yet they could not win. Even the likes of  ,  ,   and   could not beat us.
 
 "So, Australia will find it very hard," reckoned Ganguly, before adding: "I had predicted before the England Test series that it will be 5-0 in India's favour, but it ended 4-0, and against Australia it could go 4-0 as well."
 
 "In India you have to play spin well, as well as bowl spin well to win. It's as simple as that," said Ganguly.
 
 This, precisely, is also the major attribute that has seen India dominate so much at home over decades. "It's the spinners that have made India so dominant at home over the last 25 years. They just keep coming one after the other.   and Harbhajan in my time,   and Jadeja now," said Ganguly.
