 The reason why the government decided to ban his entry into China was revealed by the   when a Bieber fan posted a question on its website asking why the Canadian singer was not allowed to perform in mainland China. 
 
 “We sympathize with your feelings. Justin Bieber is a talented singer but is also a controversial young foreign idol. We understand that there are records of his bad behavior, whether it is in his private life abroad or on stage….," the bureau said, adding, “His inappropriate manner has caused public discontent. In order to regulate the market order of show business in China and purify the market environment, it was decided that performers of inappropriate behavior will not be welcomed.”
 
 Bieber was video taped being carried up the Great Wall in Beijing by Chinese body guards. This was seen as something in low taste by Chinese Internet users. The artist has had several run-ins with the law which include drunken driving. 
 
 “As far as we are concerned, he has engaged in a series of bad behaviors, both in his social life and during a previous performance in China, which caused discontent among the public," the Beijing bureau said. "We hope that as Justin Bieber matures, he can continue to improve his own words and actions, and truly become a singer beloved by the public," it explained.
