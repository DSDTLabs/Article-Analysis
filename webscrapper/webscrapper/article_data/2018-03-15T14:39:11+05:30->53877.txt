MYSURU: Till recently it was only some political parties and activists, who were opposing the use of   (EVMs), but now residents of a remote village in HD Kote taluk have put up banners in their village demanding paper   voting system instead of the EVMs.

 These banners appeared in the Huvinakola village of HD Kote. A few local youths belonging to the   (BVS) have put up the banners demanding the replacement of EVMs in the upcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections.
 
 “We want  . Across the world, 198 countries have paper ballot system. Only two countries, including India, have these EVMs. We want paper ballot system back,” a banner read.
 
 Swamy Mahadev, a local youth leader attached to BVS, told TOI that they put these banners in the month of February. “We have a democratic system and this is our demand. Paper ballots can ensure fair election and there will not be any doubt about the election results. Complaints regarding the functioning of EVMs have been reported from many parts of the country. As we are living in a democratic country we are raising our voice and expressing our concern,” he said.
 
 “It is only a demand. We are engaged in creating awareness about various social issues,” he said.
 
 An official told TOI that the district administration is not aware of the banners of such sort put up in the village and said he would send officials concerned to the spot. However, he admitted that it was not illegal. “Confidence building measures will be taken up in this regard. I will depute ZP CEO, who is the Sveep nodal officer,” he said.
 
 The official said all these issues will be set right once the Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (Sveep) is taken up by the officials in the area.
