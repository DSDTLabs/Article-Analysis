 Chandigarh: A local court on Monday directed the head of the gynaecological department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, to inform whether a 10-year-old rape survivor who is three months pregnant can undergo an abortion.
 
 The court issued summons to the doctor to be present in court on Tuesday and give opinion on whether abortion at this stage will affect the health of the child, who was raped allegedly by her maternal uncle, or not. He had sexually abused her six to seven times at her house on his visits. It was found that the girl was pregnant after she complained of stomach ache. The accused had been arrested on the complaint of the girl’s mother. Later, she had filed an application in the court to allow the 10-year-old to abort the foetus.
 
 The court had directed doctors to conduct a medical examination of the girl. During the resumed hearing on Monday, two doctors from GMCH appeared in court with a medical report. The court, however, refused to accept it and issued summons to the gynaecological department head.
 
 Under Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, abortion is a qualified right. It can only be performed by a registered medical practitioner before 12 weeks of pregnancy. In case the woman has been pregnant for more than 12 weeks – but for less than 20 weeks – opinions of two medical practitioners are required. However, an abortion is permitted only if continuing the pregnancy poses a ‘substantial risk’ to the woman’s life or to her ‘physical or mental health’.
