BENGALURU:   managing director & CEO   said the obsession of benchmarking a company’s performance with Nasscom’s forecasts do not do justice to the $150-billion IT services industry.

 He said   is an aggregation of a large spectrum of companies and there is a large dispersion in the business models and business strategies of these companies. “A few years back, it made sense (to benchmark). We should move on from that,” he said, appearing to indicate that it was time to focus on the progress companies are making in dealing with the new digital technologies.
 
 Nasscom had forecast a 7-8% growth for 2017-18 in constant currency. But   does not look like it will hit those numbers, given the performance in the past three quarters. When contacted, Nasscom president R Chandrashekhar said, “We have ourselves been saying this single number no longer represents the totality of what’s happening in the industry. Taking the aggregate revenue growth percentage, that is not a meaningful representation of what is happening in the industry.”
 
 Meanwhile, TCS has made a $440 million (Rs 2,809 crore) letter of credit to software firm   as financial security in its on-going legal tussle with the American company.
 
 “This means that unless and until the case is decided, there is no requirement for us to make any payment. Based on the legal advice received and our internal assessment, we have decided to disclose this amount as contingent liability. We will go through the appeal process,” said V Ramakrishnan, CFO of TCS. He clarified that it’s not a penalty and won’t have a material impact.
