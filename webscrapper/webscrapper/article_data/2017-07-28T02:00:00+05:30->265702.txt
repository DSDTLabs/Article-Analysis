PATNA: JD(U) hit back at its Rajya Sabha member   on Thursday for criticizing CM   over joining hands with the  . 

 “Ali ji should recall the day he was elected as MP. The way he is talking reflects his dual standards. If he has problem he should resign as he was elected with the support of BJP MLAs who were then part of the government in Bihar in 2012,” JD(U) spokesman and   said. Ali’s Rajya Sabha term will end on April 2, 2018.
 
 Ali expressed his displeasure over Nitish severing ties with the RJD and Congress. “I am personally not happy with the decision. Nitish had left BJP in 2013 because of its communal stance and announcement of   as the PM candidate. BJP’s that face (communal) is more prominent now. I will express my feelings whenever I get an opportunity to meet him (Nitish),” said Ali. 
 
 “Nitish ji always strived for corruption-free all-round development of Bihar and this is his only agenda. Nitish did not compromise with his ideology and resigned only after he realized that there was no option left before him due to the adamant stand of RJD over resignation of former deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav even after CBI lodged an FRI on July 5 in land-for-railways hotels deal,” Neeraj added.
