LUCKNOW: Lucknow bench of the Allahabad   on Monday directed the   to apprise it of the decision of the high-powered committee constituted under the chairmanship of the chief secretary to deliberate on the issue of granting and renewing licences of   and meat shops.

 The court passed the order on a fresh petition filed on Monday after it was apprised that the state government had already pondered on the issue and constituted the said committee which is scheduled to meet on April 10. The court set the matter on April 13, directing the state to file requisite affidavit detailing the entire thing.
 
 Meanwhile, hearing another petition highlighting the plight of meat vendors in Lucknow after the crackdown on illegal sellers, the court posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday after the state government sought a dayâ€™s more time to file a reply.
 
 Earlier, a bench of Justice AP Sahi and Justice Sanjai Harkauli expressed serious concern that meat shops were forcibly being closed without considering the renewal of their licences. Hearing the petitions moved against inaction of the state agencies in renewing the licences, the bench perused the legal and constitution provisions in this regard.
 
 Considering the judgment of the apex court in the Laxmi Narayan Modi case, the bench was of the view that there cannot be complete prohibition of consumption of meat as such the slaughterhouses cannot be closed. It was, however, agreed that the slaughtering and selling of meat could be regulated as per law.
 
 The state government put forth its stand that the government did not intend to ban consumption of meat which means that it was not going to close all slaughterhouses and meat shops but in fact the state government wanted that the establishment of slaughterhouses and meat shops should be regulated.
