SURAT: Gold jewellery worth Rs 1,49,500 and a CCTV video recorder were looted by three unidentified robbers at gunpoint from a jewellery showroom at   village under Limbayat police station limits here on Monday. Police are yet to get any lead about the robbers. 

 Three unidentified persons were booked at Limbayat police station for looting jewellery from  , a jewellery shop, located in the crowded market of Parvat. The complaint was lodged by Ramesh Chaudhary. The robbers arrived at the shop at around 3.20 pm and escaped with the valuables. They took out a pistol and pointed it at Chaudhary. They tied his hands and legs with a rope and escaped with the valuables. They also took the CCTV recorder with them to ensure no evidence was left behind. 
 
 The robbers escaped in a white car. The movement of the car was captured in a CCTV camera installed at a private establishment. The neighbouring shops did not have CCTV cameras and hence no clear video of the robbers could be got. 
 
 A loot of over Rs10 lakh worth of jewellery was carried out in the same shop 10 years ago. “The loot was detected then. We are investigating the case and will nab the robbers,” assistant commissioner of police, B division, N S Desai said.
