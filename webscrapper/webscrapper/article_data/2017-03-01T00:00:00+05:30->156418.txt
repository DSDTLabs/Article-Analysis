It was four years ago that   wrote and directed Shutter, which went on to win critical and commercial acclaim. Joy Mathew is now writing his next, which will have   in the lead role. The movie will be directed by Gireesh Damodar, who has worked as an associate director to Ranjith, Padmakumar etc. “The film has been titled Uncle, and will revolve around a family, like Shutter,” says Gireesh. “The social and political milieu of Kerala is of much importance in the movie and it’s about an unusual situation a family is made to face. Mammootty will be seen in a different role altogether.”

  On scripting the movie, Joy Mathew says, “It was originally a small subject but it developed over time. With Mammootty coming on board, it will be a full-fledged project. I can’t reveal the subject but it’s a socially relevant one, and very strong. Think of a 17-year-old girl and her dad’s friend, uncle. That’s all I can say now.”
  Gireesh has been in the industry for more than 15 years, and there is a reason he took his own time to direct a movie, he says. “When I do a movie, I wanted it to be a really good one. My friendship with Joy Mathew goes back to 30 years. So when we casually discussed a subject once, we decided to take it up. We are now looking out for the 17-year-old actress. She has an important role in the movie.” 
 
  The movie will be shot in Ooty and Kozhikode.
