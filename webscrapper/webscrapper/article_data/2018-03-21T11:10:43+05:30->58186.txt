BAINA: A new airport   was opened on Tuesday at Baina beach, by Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari. 

 The passenger ferryboats Drishti Two and Drishti Three, which have already been made operational between Vasco, Panaji, Old Goa and Sinquerim, are expected to be used by tourists landing at   to travel to these areas using waterways. 
 
 Gadkari said that the Goa government should also consider connecting the new airport coming up at Mopa by waterways.
 
 The airport ferry terminal at Baina beach is just five kilometres away from the Dabolim airport and free shuttle service will be provided to tourists to get from the airport to Baina beach. Bookings can be done online or on the spot by passengers.
 
 “Waterways will reduce pollution. This waterway will help foreign and Indian tourists travel to their hotel by boats. As a result, diesel consumption will reduce and people will enjoy another facet of tourism by travelling over water. This is a win-win situation. This will create new employment as well,” Gadkari said, asking hotels to invest in their own private terminals where the ferry boats can land with the hotel’s guests.
 
 The Drishti Marine ferryboat terminal is fully dismantleable in keeping with coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms.
 
 “In phase two, we will start a ferryboat service from the Airport Ferry Terminal to Baga, Sinquerim, as well as Chapora Fort. At the same time, we will simultaneously start a service to South Goa to Mobor beach and Palolem Beach,” Ravi Shankar, CEO, Drishti Marine, said.
 
 This is a new beginning for water transport in Goa, said I  , chairman of   (MPT), on whose behalf Drishti Marine is operating the ferry service.
 
 Tickets for ferry services have to be booked online at www.drishtiferry.com.
