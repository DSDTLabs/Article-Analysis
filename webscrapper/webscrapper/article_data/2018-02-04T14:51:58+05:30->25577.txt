 However, when we contacted Suresh Babu, he said that Mohanlal’s casting is yet to be confirmed. Suresh Babu had earlier told us, “The story follows the life of Lathika, a textile salesgirl, who is based in Thrippunithura. Because of the metro work, she had to vacate her home and shift to Aluva. The crux of the film is about her attempts to meet her inspiration, the Metro Man, who had spearheaded the project.”
