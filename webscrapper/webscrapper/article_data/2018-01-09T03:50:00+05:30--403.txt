Margao: The Gawda Kunbi Velip and Dhangar Federation ( ) has demanded that the government take immediate steps to process all pending applications under the Goa tribal employment generation programme (GTEGP) under the tribal sub-plan, by January 26, failing which it has threatened to launch a “protest fast” at Azad Maidan, Panaji. Addressing reporters on Monday, general secretary of the federation, Rupesh Velip, said that while the directorate of industries, trade and commerce was the implementing agency, the loan amounts were disbursed through Tribal Multipurpose Co-operative Society. After a modification to the scheme, the loans are disbursed through EDC, which has led to delays, he said. TNN
