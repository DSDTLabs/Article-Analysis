AHMEDABAD: The Admission Committee for Professional Undergraduate Medical Educational Courses ( ) will   for admissions on 14,000 seats in   in Gujarat on Wednesday evening.

 The admission process for state quota students has already been delayed. It is supposed to be over before the admission process begins for the all India quota.
 
  Till date, one round for admissions in the all India quota has got over, but ACPMEC has not been able to declare the provisional merit list. After the merit list is out, the students will be called for mock round, to file their choice for college.
 
 The committee is likely to announce schedules for admission in all courses, but the prevailing flood situation across the state might defer the decision. Sources said that the committee has sought guidance from the state government in this regard, as nearly 1,000 students have not been able to get their documents verified due to adverse weather conditions. A meeting will be held on Wednesday to decide on admission schedules.
 
 The admission process is taking place online for the first time for the 14,000 seats in medical and paramedical courses, and 37,179 students had obtained PINs. 
 
 There are 33,026 students who got themselves registered online, but only 21,989 students could complete the process of verification of documents.
