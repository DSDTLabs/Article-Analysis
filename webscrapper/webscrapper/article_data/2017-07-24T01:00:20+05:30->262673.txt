 According to a Huda official, several shops, eateries, liquor vends and nurseries that were illegally set up in on the strech were razed by the department. 
 
 The move came after the development body received complaints from residents, who recently shifted to the condominiums developed in new sectors along SPR. They informed the development authority about the shrinking green space that they had been promised, owing to the  . 
 
 The illegal structured had not only destroyed the green space, but had also deprived residents of pedestrian space. Roadside parking was also resulting in huge traffic jams on the stretch during peak hours, said an official.
 
 The urban development authority had acquired 90 metres of land on either side of the SPR to develop a green area and widen the road in the future. The illegal structures came up along SPR between Sector 62 and 65.
 
 “To ensure that encroachers do not return to the area, the authority has decided to fence the area and develop greenery,” Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav said, adding that the greenery would not only add to the aesthetics of the area, but also help check pollution. 
 
 However, residents of the area were satisfied with the demolition drive. “Earlier, people used to park their cars by the roadside to visit shops, leaving little space for commuters. This led to huge traffic snarls during the peak hours. Now, we hope the traffic flow to be smooth as there will be no obstruction,” said Ritesh Malhotra, a resident of Sector 65. 
 
 Manoj Yadav, a resident of Sector 62, heaved a sigh of relief and hoped that the area would be safe now onwards. “The crowding of this stretch had given rise to criminal acts here. Now, we hope the situation will be peaceful,” Yadav said.
