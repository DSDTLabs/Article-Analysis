AMARAVATI:   Kumar, principal secretary to the government, instructed the officials to review all the petitions for the   lands and allocate lands or houses on the basis of the eligibility of the petitioners as well as the availability of the house lands. 

 He participated in the review meeting with the revenue and municipal officials on Thursday. Since there is a scarcity of housing lands in cities, towns, mandal villages, or major pachayats, the steps should be taken to allot built houses of G+2 model for the petitioners, Dinesh said.
