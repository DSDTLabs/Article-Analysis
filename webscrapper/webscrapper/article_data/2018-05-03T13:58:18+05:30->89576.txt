COIMBATORE: Residents of   at K K Nagar near Saibaba Kovil on Wednesday staged a   after the civic body continued to lay roads, despite heavy rain.

 On the third Zakir Hussain Street, roads were dug up to lay new ones. And the work on laying the new   has been going on for a week now. When it rained heavily three days ago, the workers didn’t stop the work and continued to unload materials and lay the road.
 
 “We asked them to lay the road after the rain. We told them that the tar won’t stick properly and there was no point in laying such a road. But the workers threatened us and told us that they will continue to lay the road,” said A J Hussain, a local resident and district secretary of SDPI.
 
 On May 1, he said, the residents petitioned the corporation assistant engineer, Angeline of ward 10, where the road is located and requested her to ensure the road is of good quality.
 
 As there was no action, the residents on Wednesday took to the roads. “Police officials and corporation officials reached the spot and held talks with us. They told us that they will ensure that the road work is carried out as per the norms and the quality is maintained,” Hussain said.
