NEW DELHI:   president   on Monday stressed on the "resilience" of the Tibetan spirit, drawing from the 2500-Buddhist tradition, and said the community is not scared of Communist China.

 "When people ask are you not scared of China? China is so powerful economically, militarily, politically. We say we are not, Communism is 100 years old while Buddhism is 2,500 years old, there is no competition between the two," Sangay said at the launch of the community "Thank You India" campaign, marking the 60th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's arrival in India. Expressing gratitude towards India, the CTA president said the ancient civilisation and culture of   that were "almost destroyed" had been preserved by India.
 
 Sangay said the Tibetan community wanted PM Modi's 'Make In India' initiative to succeed, as their movement was originally 'made in India' with its leaders being born, brought up and educated here.
