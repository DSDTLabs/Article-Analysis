AHMEDABAD: The city civil and sessions court got a new principal sessions judge in M K Dave, who has been transferred from Patan district by the   high court.

 Judge Dave has been appointed head of this court after P B Desai retired from the post last month. Judge Desai was designated to hear sensitive cases under the   (NIA) Act, Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) as well as the post-Godhra riots cases of the   massacre, which is being prosecuted by the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT).
 
 After Desai’s retirement, the charge of cases being tried under NIA Act and Pota have not been delegated to any other sessions judge.
 
 It is expected that the high court may designate the principal sessions judge, Dave, to preside over these cases. The city sessions court’s main public prosecutor   said, “The notification for designation of the principal judge for NIA, Pota and Naroda Gam has not been issued yet.”
