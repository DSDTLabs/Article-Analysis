Between the C P Pavalavannan subway bustling with traffic and the busy Saidapet railway station teeming with commuters is a dilapidated structure on East Jones Road where time stands still. A look at the cracked walls and broken iron gates give away little of the buzz around the building, which till three decades ago helped to fund education of children.

 It is not very difficult to coax old timers to reminisce about the glory that was once a signature of this landmark structure. S V Janakiraman, who runs a laundry services in the area remembers that the building was constructed in two phases. "While the hall was built in 1913, the second portion was constructed 10 years later," he said. A plaque on the premises bears the name of Vankayala Kuppiah Chettiar of Mambalam with an inscription saying: ‘This hall with verandah was constructed for Saidapet Annadhana Samajam, April, 1924’.
 
 The   was one of the few such facilities that were available in those days. "It was operated as a marriage hall, one of two in the locality. Several marriages used to be conducted in the hall that charged a nominal charge of `30 in 1971," said Janakiraman. Revenue generated from the hall was donated for running a school on Seshachalam Street that offered free noon-meals to students. He said since the facility was meant for philanthropic activities, it was known as ‘Annadana
 
 Chatram’.
 
 The hall lost its relevance when the school started receiving government aid. 
 
 According to Janakiraman the one acre plot housing the heritage structure is under litigation. Though there was an attempt to convert the building into a tahsildar’s office, it did not materialise.
