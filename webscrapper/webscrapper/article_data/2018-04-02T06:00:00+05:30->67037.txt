Deva Katta is finally going to begin his Bollywood sojurn with the remake of his 2010 film, Prasthanam. “The shooting of the film will start from May 25 in Lucknow. Unlike  , which had a Vijayawada backdrop, its Hindi remake is set in Uttar Pradesh. While Sanjay Dutt will be reprising the role of Sai Kumar,   has been roped in to play Sharwanand’s character and   will play Sudeep Kishen’s role,” informed a source. 
Apparently, Deva has already decided on the runtime of the remake. “There have been certain changes made to the script to suit the sensibilities of the Hindi audience. Deva Katta felt that the love story between   and Ruby Parihar was a bit loose in the original version so he has made it meatier and integrated it to the overall plot of the remake. The runtime of the movie also has been trimmed to 2 hours 10 minutes,” the source revealed, adding, “The heroine will be finalised in a couple of weeks. As of now, the makers are sticking to the Telugu title for the remake as well.”
