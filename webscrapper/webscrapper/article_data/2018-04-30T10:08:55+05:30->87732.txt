CHENNAI: Imagine a train ride where you can see the scenic beauty of the western ghats through the large windows of an air-conditioned chair car, in the   section or a trip from Madurai to   where you can witness the blue sea from the Pamban bridge. 

  officials are planning such tourism packages to capture the crowd during the summer holidays. Along with Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), discussions are under way to give an experience of 'eco-tourism' and 'temple tourism' on these two sections, especially for foreign tourists.
 
 According to sources, the proposals for tour packages between Madurai and Rameswaram and one to the Sengottai-Punalur section are being discussed . Though railway officials in the zone are keen on having a vistadome coach for the two circuits, it is not available. A vistadome coach has huge windows beside the seats and also has a see-through glass roof which gives the passenger an all-round view of the scenery around the train. .
 
 Railway officials are now planning to operate the air-conditioned chair car coach for the tour packages in the absence of the vistadome coach. The AC chair car coach will be the one used in   train which has a comfortable seating and wide windows.
 
 The first package likely to get a green light will be a trip from Madurai to Rameswaram on the Pamban bridge.
