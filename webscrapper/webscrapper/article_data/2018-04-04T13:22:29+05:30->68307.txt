GAYA: A record 569 villages were   in   during the last two months under the ‘Saat Nishchay’ initiative of CM  .

 The electrification figure was discused during a review meet held in the Gaya collectorate on Monday. According to an official press release, there were at least 683 non-electrified villages in the district on February 7, the day CM Kumar reviewed the execution of development schemes in the Magadh division.
 
 The electrification of 569 villages between February 7 and March 31, 2018, has brought down the number of non-electrified villages to 114. DM   has directed the electricity department to electrify the remaining 114 villages on a war footing.
 
 The DM said fast-paced work was being done on the ground in the district, but the process of uploading the related data to official websites was lethargic. As a result, Gaya appeared to be lagging behind certain other districts of the state. 
 
 The DM directed the officials concerned to upload all the data by April 10, 2018.
