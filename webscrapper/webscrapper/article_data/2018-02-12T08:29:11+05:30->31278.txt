PUNE: Four years ago, when   joined   in Goriya village, she never thought that changing school was going to be a lifechanging decision for her.

 
 It was at her new school where Manu, then 12, was introduced to shooting. In less than four years, she is in India’s senior   team as a 10m air pistol shooter. At 16, she will be the youngest woman participant to represent the country in shooting World Cups.
 
 Manu started competing only two years ago. She is already national champion in all three categories she is eligible to participate in — youth (U-18), junior (U-21) and senior — with 15 medals from the   in December last year.
 
 “We have a small 10m range in our school. I used to participate in all sports earlier, but I stopped everything once I tried shooting. Within a month of practising, I got my first pistol and it only got serious from there,” Manu said. “It is a manual range and not the one with electronic targets, but I have no issues with that. If you keep the basics intact, you can adjust to other things.”
 
 Other than a clean sweep at the Nationals, the standard XI student had recently clinched gold in the 10m air pistol event at the Khelo India School Games by bettering the junior (U-21) national record in New Delhi. But then, she is more about future than history.
 
 “I know it will be a big year for me, but I am not taking any pressure,” Mauu told TOI. “I am just a beginner; pressure is more for people who have already played at higher level. I am not taking it lightly, but I am also not losing my sleep over it.”
