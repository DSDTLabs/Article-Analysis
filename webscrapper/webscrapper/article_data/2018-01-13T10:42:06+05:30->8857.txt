 Nitesh Khare, honorary animal welfare officer under the Union government’s Animal Welfare Board of India, alleged that he was recently threatened by a constable at the   police station when he went there to file a complaint.
 
 S P Jadhav, the senior inspector of the Wakad police, said, “We have not come across any complaint about an animal welfare officer being threatened. Had such a complaint come to our notice, we would have taken strict action. All police stations have been instructed to deal with animal cruelties strictly.”
