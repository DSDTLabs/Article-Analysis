 Neil's aunt took to the mic, to dole out 'Babuji Zara Dheere Chalo' and 'Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu'. The food, we hear, was scrumptious, with Indian chaats and parathas on the menu. And of course, there was a truck full of Neil's favourite food item, candyfloss. Many of the dishes on the menu took local inspiration such as Jodhpuri Kabuli Palao, Bikaner Ki Sangri, Jaipuri Kurkuri Bhindi, Jaisameri Macchli and Rajgharane Ka Maas. All guests were handed out a return hamper comprising of Mojri footwear from Patiala, Punjabi parandas(hair accessory) from Ludhiana and attractive leheriya dupattas handpicked by Nishi Mukesh from the local bazaar.
