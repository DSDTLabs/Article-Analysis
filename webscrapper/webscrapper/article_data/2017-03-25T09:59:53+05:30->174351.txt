GUWAHATI: The National Highway Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited ( ) has been asked to finish building the   road within this year. 

 The decision was taken after a Silchar-based NGO, People's Society, approached the Gauhati high court and asked it to direct the PWD and the   (Road) division of Meghalaya to cooperate with their Assam counterparts and complete the remaining 2.8-km stretch of the road soon. The petitioner's counsel, Bishwajyoti Purkayastha, said, "Construction of the remaining stretch of the road had been suspended for a very long time due to an interstate boundary dispute between Assam and Meghalaya. 
 
 The North Eastern Council, Shillong, informed the court that construction of the remaining stretch of the road had been handed over to NHIDCL and might be completed in 2017-2018 fiscal year. tnn
