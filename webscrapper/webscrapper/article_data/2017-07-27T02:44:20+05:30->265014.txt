NEW DELHI: Little regard for road safety, absence of cops at critical junctions and non-functioning traffic signals are some of the factors contributing to the rising of number of accidents at night. More than 50% of the road deaths take place past midnight. According to   records, 612 fatal accidents took place in the city between January and June this year. In other words, road accidents claim three   a day on average.

 A study conducted by the traffic police revealed that the two ring roads were veritable deathtraps, with 203 people perishing on these arterial stretches that connect almost all parts of the city, this year.
 
 Almost 50% of the pedestrian deaths took place either due to lack of designated footpaths in many places or for the reason that the victim was crossing the road at night. 
 
 Nearly 80% of the deaths involving two-wheelers were caused by two factors: they toppled after hitting another vehicle or a pole due to speeding.
 
 The maximum number of fatal accidents occurred between 11pm and midnight. Cops say that private cars were found to be biggest killers on road during this time.
 
 Most of the accidents took place near flyovers and junctions. At night, apart from the two ring roads, highways—GT Karnal Road, Rohtak Road, NH-8 and Grand Trunk Road—passing through, the city accounted for most of the other fatalities due to lack of monitoring by cops or the transport department.
