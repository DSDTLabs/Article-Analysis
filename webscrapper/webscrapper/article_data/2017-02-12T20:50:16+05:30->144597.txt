BEIJING: Chinese soldier,  , who has arrived in his home village, has not yet decided if he wants to live in China for good or return to India. He is accompanied by his son,  , daughter in law, Neha and grand daughter but Wang's wife and daughter have stayed behind.

 It is not clear if his wife and his daughter, who are believed to have stayed back for health reasons, will later join   in his village in Xian province of China. There are signs the family will take a decision after seeing how things turn out for them in China. Indian authorities have stamped a one-year visa on his Chinese passport giving him sufficient time to decide his next course of action. 
 
 Chinese government has taken the rare decision of giving a relatively long two year visa to his son and grand daughter in what appears to be a signal that Beijing wants them to stay back. 
 
 The Chinese television and news websites carried pictures and video showing Wang in tears as he met his loved ones and acquitances after decades. The Chinese media is painting a picture of India stopping Wang from visiting his home country but there is no explanation about why it took the Chinese embassy in New Delhi several decades to provide him with a passport since he was released from jail in 1969.
 
 This is 77-year old Wang's first visit to China since 1962 when he strayed across the border from China. He was detained and stayed in jail till 1969 after which he has lived in a   village. His son, Vishnu, thanked the Chinese government formaking arrangements for the visit and expressed sadness that the visit did not take place earlier. 
 
 The Chinese media also showed interviews given by his wife, Sushila, in Hindi, which were taken in India.
