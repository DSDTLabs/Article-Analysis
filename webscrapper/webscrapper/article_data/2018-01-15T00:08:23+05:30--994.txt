Thiruvananthapuram: New Year plans to resume   at Rajiv Gandhi Academy for Aviation Technology ( ) will not become a reality. The academy staff had planned to begin the flying training from first week of January, but, the training is likely to begin from next month only.

 The delay in obtaining airport entry permit for the new chief flying instructor (CFI) is the latest hurdle to restart the flying training at the academy. There had been no flying training in the academy for the past six months, due to absence of CFI.
 
 According to academy authorities, the CFI needs to attend a mandatory aviation security (AVSEC) training and clear the examination to receive the airport entry permit.
 
 “The procedure for obtaining airport entry permit for three months or for one year is a long process. So, we had applied for one-month airport entry permit for the CFI Captain N Mallikarjun, but, we were informed that he needs to attend the aviation security class to receive the permit. The norms for airport entry permit were made stringent recently,” said Gopakumar R L, secretary of RAGAAT.
 
 “The new CFI has already received the training in aviation security while working in the previous flying school and we have asked him to send application for the certificate from the flying club, else it will be a long process to complete the training again. There are institutes for AVSEC training in Hyderabad and Mumbai, but it will further delay the flying training at the academy. We hope to resume the training from next month after completing all mandatory procedures, if the CFI receives the AVSEC certificate from previous flying club soon,” added Gopakumar.
