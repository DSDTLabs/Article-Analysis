CHENNAI: In a first, the Madras high court recognised a religious organisation as the legal   of a deceased person, and declared it eligible to receive compensation in a motor accident claims case.

 
 Justice A M Basheer Ahamed permitted St Maria Auxilum Sisters’s Congress, represented by its mother general Sister Animariya, to claim compensation for the death of Sister Alangara Mary.
 
 On March 1, 2002, Mary died in a road accident. Claiming the death occurred due to rash driving of the bus, the Sisters’s Congress in which Mary was a member approached the motor accident tribunal for ex gratia.
