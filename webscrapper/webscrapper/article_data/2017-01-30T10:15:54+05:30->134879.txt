BHOPAL: The engineering students of   ( ) will soon have to score minimum 31% in both theory and practical exams to clear a paper. In the review meeting held on Monday, the university has decided to make changes in the ordinance.

 All over the state, there are around 200 engineering colleges affiliated to RGPV. On the condition of anonymity, a senior official of RGPV told TOI that the final decision will be taken after a feedback from colleges and teachers. Recently, RGPV was criticised after students scoring zero marks in theory were able to clear the semester.
 
 According to sources, the new rule will be applicable on students taking admission from the next academic session.
 
 In 2015, RGPV had introduced ordinance 4B for Bachelor of Engineering (4-year-degree programme) candidates who had joined under the Choice Based Credit System ( ) which was applicable after July 2015. 
 
 “The university and college give on 60:40 basis in a paper carrying 100 marks. Under ordinance 4B, the mandatory rule of scoring 31% out of 60 marks to clear the paper was removed and students were required to score 31% out of 100. It means that even if a student scores 0 marks, he can clear that paper with the help of marks given by a college as no institution would like to fail its student. This is where the problem lies,” said a senior official on the condition of anonymity.
 
 The ordinance was implemented to help students who were weak in one or two subjects and were unable to clear the exam. However, two years after regularisation of the ordinance, RGPV found that students were taking undue benefit of it. 
 
 The review meeting will also decide the future of students who failed in their first semester. "Decision will be on whether re-exam for such students should be conducted or not," said an official of RGPV.
