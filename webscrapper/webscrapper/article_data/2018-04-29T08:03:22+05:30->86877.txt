KOZHIKODE:   (SDPI) will take out a rally in the city on Monday defying the ban order imposed by the police.   state president Abdul Majeed   said the party has decided to hold protest marches to the office of the district police chiefs in all districts on the same day.

 SDPI had scheduled a rally and public meeting here on April 19 to protest the mounting attacks against dalits and minorities in the country in the wake of Kathua incident. The meeting was postponed to April 30 after police imposed prohibitory orders when the hartal on April 16 turned violent. Faizi said SDPI had sought permission well in advance. “Police placed before us some unreasonable restrictions. They wanted us to inform them in advance what the leaders would speak at the rally. This reminds us the Emergency,” he said.
 
 SDPI leaders said police finally withdrew permission for the rally on Friday morning.
 
 “There is a clear partiality in the police approach towards SDPI. They allowed CPI, DYFI and the INL to hold meeting despite the ban. We want to know why the LDF government and police are denying us our democratic rights,” he said.
 
 Faizi said nearly 2,000 people were arrested in the name of violence during the social media hartal, which is unheard of in  . “Many of those arrested were charged IPC Section 153 (a) for causing communal tension. Police distorted the anti-RSS slogans as slogans against the Hindu community,” he said.
