LUCKNOW: The police on Monday finalized the hashtag which needs to be used to highlight complaints pertaining to the upcoming assembly elections over Twitter.

 “Twitter users can alert us about violations or issues by adding #UPPOL17 while tagging @UPPolice. Local police will be asked to check the complaint,” said DGP Javeed Ahmad while revealing the selected key words along with   CEO, Raheel Khursheed.
 
 The department had received about 500 suggestions through crowdsourcing. The one offered by Delhi-based communication strategist, Navneet Anand was finalized. “The idea was to come up with a crisp but conveying hashtag and we preferred this one,” said additional superintendent Rahul Srivastava, who heads the social media cell of the police.
 
 The department will popularize the hashtag with the help of radio stations and other media outlets. As majority of people use smartphones these days, a huge number of complaints pertaining to violation of model code of conduct are expected in the coming weeks.
 
 The police department’s Twitter Seva initiative, kicked off seven months back, has been gaining a lot of traction. The cell handles about 115 general grievances on Twitter daily, hence a hashtag was required to segregate poll-related complaints.
