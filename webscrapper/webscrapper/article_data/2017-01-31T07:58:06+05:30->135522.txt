JAIPUR: While complaining about paucity of funds, the   government has failed to   lying in its coffers optimally. In nine months, the government has been able to spend only 55.78% of the sanctioned plan budget, with agriculture and   lagging far behind.

 Though the agriculture department organized the Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet (GRAM) 2016 to focusing on concerns of farmers, in reality it managed to spend about 27% of the allocated budget.
 
 For the 2016-17 financial year, the department received Rs 2,078 crore, but managed to utilize only Rs 564 crore.
 
 From the Rs 484 crore sanctioned for the   (PMKSY), an important scheme for the water-deprived state, the department could only use about Rs 98 crore (20%).
 
 Similarly, under the   scheme aimed at increasing production of wheat, pulses and rice, the department managed to disburse only Rs 39 crore (12%) from an outlay of Rs 323 crore.
 
 The Kisan Sewa Kendra, meanwhile, spent a measly Rs 9 crore from Rs 109 allocated to it.
 
 Figures of the horticulture department too reflect poor execution in implementing schemes for farmers. While Rs 447 crore was allocated for several schemes, only Rs 119 crore was spent by the department.
 
 The total plan outlay of the state government for 2016-17 was Rs 67,000 crore (without UDAY). Out of this, Rs 44,378 crore has been spent. In 2015, the government had managed to utilize 53.57% of the sanctioned budget.
 
 The budget management of the public works department (PWD) was also poor. As per available data, the government sanctioned Rs 5,239 crore to the department. It, however, managed to spend only Rs 1,499 crore, constituting 28.5% of the total allocation.
 
 Though it pushed for projects under public-private partnership (PPP), not a single penny from the sanctioned Rs 199 crore was spent on such projects. Concerned minister Yunus Khan could not be reached for comments.
 
 The medical and health department too could utilize only 59% of the sanctioned amount. But the free drug distribution scheme, which had come under severe criticism, saw an expenditure of about 75%.
