BENGALURU: Cash-strapped   ( ) has decided to pledge 200 corner sites at the extended layouts of Sir M Visvesvaraya and   6th Phase to raise Rs 200 crore needed for developing   there.

 In a letter (No: 3684/2018) to the   dated February 6, 2018, BDA commissioner Rakesh Singh sought the government’s permission for it. If the government gives its consent, this would add to the 400 sites the agency has already pledged with various banks to raise around Rs 371crore.
 
 
 
  
 
 Sources said BDA is forced to pledge sites and raise money due to severe shortage of funds which is hampering development of layouts. “Every layout needs basic infrastructure and that costs money. For instance, water connections, undergound drainage and roads in the extended Sir M Visvesvaraya Layout and Banashankari 6th Phase Layout is estimated to cost nearly Rs 180 crore. We also need another Rs 250 crore to Rs 280 crore for other work,” a source said.
 
 On why the BDA is not selling the sites at full value instead or mortgaging them — given that banks do not lend money equivalent to the value of the site and also charge interest— a source said it’s because the sites don’t command full value.
 
 “If we auction the corner sites, they may fetch about Rs 70 lakh each as the layouts lack basic amenities. Once developed, they will fetch at least Rs 1crore,” the source said.
 
 “We are at minus Rs 7,000 crore (revenue shortfall). It was minus Rs 5,000 crore and it’s adding up. I have to pledge land only to get some loan and repay some debt and build whatever we can,” Rakesh Singh said.
 
 Also, there aren’t enough takers for these sites through auction given the lack of facilities. Last year, the agency invited bidders for 30 corner sites to be sold in auction in various layouts but managed to sell only five.
