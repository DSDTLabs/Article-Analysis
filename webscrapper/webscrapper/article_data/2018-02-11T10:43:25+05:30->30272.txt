PATNA: The state vigilance investigation bureau (VIB) has found loopholes in the cancellation of contract for upkeep of all airconditioners at   and Hospital ( ) and submitted its report in this regard to the Patna high court on Thursday.

 The division bench of Justices   and  , while hearing a Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) filed by one Babban Prasad Singh, had asked the VIB on December 4 last year to probe the allegations. Singh, in the LPA, has challenged the cancellation of the 30-month contract given to him only after 22 months. He contended that the contract was later given to electricity department without any prior intimation to him.
 
 “The court had found unsatisfactory the supplementary counter affidavit filed by PMCH against the LPA. The documents submitted about the rates supposedly quoted by the electricity department were also found to be misleading,” Babban’s counsel   said. 
 
 The VIB report found that a backdated entry was made regarding the dispatch of cancellation letter in the dispatch register and peon book of PMCH. The court found it to be a prima facie case of criminal conspiracy and asked the vigilance department to lodge an FIR against former PMCH superintendent Dr Lakhinder Prasad and others for their alleged involvement in the case. 
 
 Prasad, in his counter affidavit, stated that the appellant had been asking an exorbitantly high rate for maintenance of ACs and that was the reason behind cancellation of his contract.
 
 “The court had dismissed the writ petition following Prasad’s counter affidavit. Babban, however, filed an LPA and it was later found in the investigative report that the electricity board had not quoted any rate against the tender,” said PMCH counsel and additional advocate general-4 Anjani Kumar.
