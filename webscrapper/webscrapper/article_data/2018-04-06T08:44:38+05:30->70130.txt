CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government will rehabilitate 254   that had migrated after two persons were burnt alive in an inter-caste violence in Mirchpur village of Hisar district eight years ago, minister of state for welfare of Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes   said here on Thursday.

 “The decision in this regard has been taken on the initiatives of the chief minister. The Mirchpur incident happened on April 21, 2010, and the victim families were forced to migrate and wander for eight years due to negligence of the then   government,”   said.
 
 The affected families will be rehabilitated on over eight acres of land at   in Hisar district from June 1, he said after meeting with a delegation of Mirchpur villagers here on Thursday. 
 
 The Dalits had fled the village after 70-year-old Tara Chand and his 17-year-old physically challenged daughter Suman were burnt when their house in Mirchpur was set ablaze by members of an upper caste on April 21, 2010. The trigger for the mayhem was said to be a dispute between upper caste men and a Dalit man over a barking dog.
 
 At least 18 houses were destroyed in the attack. The incident, which made national headlines, happened during the Congress rule in Haryana.
 
 Financial assistance for construction of houses would also be given to the 254 families under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, Bedi said.
 
 “The government had given them the option of choosing between Hisar municipal corporation, Barwala municipal committee, Uklana and Hansi municipal council. But they expressed their desire to settle at Dhandoor,” he said, adding that the Mirchpur incident had become a national issue during the regime of previous government. “But unfortunately victim families were left in lurch due to lack of willpower of the previous regime,” the minister said.
