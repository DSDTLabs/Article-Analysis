Chennai: Days after a 14-year-old student from government school in Kumbakonam died due to snake bite on the school premises, the state’s school education department has issued a government order (GO) announcing   scheme for students (and their families) of government and government-aided schools. 

 The compensation is applicable to any cases of accidents leading to injury or death. Education minister K A Sengottaiyan last week had announced the scheme that provides Rs 1 lakh compensation in case of a student death, Rs 50,000 for heavy injury sustained by a student and Rs 25,000 for minor injuries. This is applicable to students across primary, middle, high school and higher secondary school classes in government and government-aided schools in the state.
 
 Currently, there are 55.73 lakh students studying across 37,201 government schools, while another 29.51 lakh students are studying across 45,603 government-aided schools in Tamil Nadu.
 
 This will be applicable to any injuries or accidents – be it electrocution, insect bites, water accidents, injuries sustained during tours, while participating in NCC or scouts, sports events, Red Cross or while touring and participating in government-sponsored schemes and functions in the state, etc.
 
 The GO states that the government has granted powers to the school education director R Elangovan to release these funds in case of any injuries or accidents. 
 
 Earlier this month, B Rajesh, a Class VIII student of a government-aided higher secondary school at S Pudur, had reportedly died of a snake bite while playing in the school.
