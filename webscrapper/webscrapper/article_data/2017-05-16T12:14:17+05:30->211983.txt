Pune: Minister of state for defence Subhash   on Sunday said Pakistan was fighting a proxy war in Kashmir to cover up the failure to resolve its own internal issues.

 Bhamre told TOI, “There is no immediate solution to the Kashmir issue. But, the government is considering all options to resolve the issue.”
 
 The minister added that Pakistan is a victim of terrorism, but does not heed to it. “Pakistan has taken a dual stance on terrorism. They term it as bad terrorism and good terrorism at a time when the whole world is facing the menace. We need to fight it. We hope Pakistan will realise it soon,” Bhamre said.
 
 Praising the strength of the Indian armed forces, the minister said, “The Indian armed forces are capable of carrying out cross-border operations and the last year’s surgical strike has proven it. If the situation arises, our armed forces can carry out surgical strikes better than the US and or Israeli forces.”
