BENGALURU: The   on Monday had a visible green tint to it.   harnessed discarded flowers to come up with ecofriendly, safeto-use and   for the festivities.

 Psychiatric patients processed flowers that were sourced from marriages, temples, community halls, flower shows and gardens for free over the last few months. From segregating them based on colours to drying the petals, they did it all. The petals were then sent for crushing to make colourful powders out of them. All along, they were guided by their instructor  .
 
 Once ready , the colours were sold in pouches to staffers, patients and their families and other visitors at the hospital's outpatient department.
 
 The activity lasted for months, helping the participants focus and build concentration. “I liked the activity. The flowers were soft and smelt so good,“ said a patient.
 
 Separating the flowers based on their colours helped patients identify things. They were are asked to cut them using scis sors and remove the pollen. “This activity is highly rewarding and helps build concentration. This way, a patient also spends time doing some thing productive. Work is assigned according to each person's ability,“ said Mythri.
 
 “As these flowers are trash for others, we col lect them to help our patients. An activity like this keeps them engaged,“ she added. Over 75% of the work, like drying and cleaning the flowers, was done by the patients. “It was important to clean all the flowers as pres ence of any pollen grain could alter the tone of the colours. Also, it's very important to cut the flower in shape and a few patients mastered that skill,“ said Nimhans staffers.
 
 The patients included people from remand homes, day boarding and those from the hospital wards.
 
 “It's a wonderful activity where patients extract natural colours. Also, the process of segregating petals according to colours helps improve their concentration and attention,“ said Dr BN Gangadhar, director, Nimhans.
