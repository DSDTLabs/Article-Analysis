NEW DELHI: An additional district judge of Delhi is in the dock after   found that he set aside a 2012 order last year when it was not even under challenge before him.

 Slamming him for “demonstrating complete lack of knowledge of basics of law” HC has said such orders “will result in a rule of jungle and not rule of law.”
 
 Justice Valmiki Mehta has also sent a copy of his verdict, containing stringent observations against ADJ to the acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal, to bring the officer’s conduct to her notice.
 
 Justice Mehta directed that “the judgment of this court be also sent to the Inspecting Judges Committee of this judicial officer for 2016” and requested the committee (a panel of HC judges that monitors judges of subordinate judiciary) to consider not only the illegality by ADJ in passing the judgment but also the strong observations made by HC. The court’s rare rebuke, where it singled out a subordinate judge, came while hearing an appeal by Delhi Transport Corporation ( ) against the decision by ADJ.
 
 In 2012, DTC won a suit against   for illegally displaying its ads on a bus queue shelter owned by the corporation. The court granted a decree in favour of DTC faulting Vidya Mandir for putting up an   without a licence. A year later, DTC filed an execution petition to enforce the 2012 order and won again.
 
 However, Vidya Mandir Classes Ltd again moved court, this time claiming it is not liable to execute the decree since the order was against Vidya Mandir Classes. The court trashed the objection but in appeal, the firm won a bonanza –ADJ over turned the 2012 decree itself, which was not a matter of challenge by Vidya Mandir.
 
 Justice Mehta listed these transgressions by the AJ and observed, “I am forced to say that the first appellate court has travelled totally beyond its jurisdiction and assumed powers which no law of this country gives.” HC also took a dim view of the ADJ’s defence that he acted because he found the 2012 order illegal.
