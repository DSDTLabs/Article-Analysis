HYDERABAD: People turning up at the doorstep of so-called 'diabetologists' need to be clear about who they are actually visiting, say experts, who warn that the 'diabetologist' tag is not a legally approved by the   (MCI). 

 The term is loosely used to refer to either an endocrinologist (a super-specialist doctor in   and other hormones with three years training after the PG medical course) or an MD general physician (three year PG course after MBBS) practising diabetes management. Experts say a third group also use this tag and they are the cause of worry.
 
 "This third group mostly comprise   who may have gone through   for a few months and started practising as diabetelogists. Since these courses are not recognised by MCI, their practice can be called illegal," said Dr  , director, Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Adiposity.
 
 Dr K Ramesh Reddy, MCI member said only endocrinologists or MD general physicians are entitled to practice diabetes management. 
 
 "If any one else claims to be a specialist, they are liable for action for violation of MCI's code of ethics," he said.
