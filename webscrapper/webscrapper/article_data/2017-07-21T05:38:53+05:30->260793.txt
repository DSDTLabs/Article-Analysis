NEW DELHI: Drumming up ascension of   as the 14th President of the country,  's SC morcha organised countrywide celebrations on Thursday, sending out a message about how the saffron party had worked towards the emancipation of the Dalit community.
BJP SC Morcha netas burst firecrackers and distributed sweets as they went around Dalit colonies across the country to celebrate Kovind's victory. “We organised utsav in Dalit colonies,“ said BJP SC Morcha president and Lok Sabha MP Vinod Kumar Sonkar.   has been a president of the SC Morcha.
 
 Sonkar said all state heads of the Morcha were asked to celebrate the occasion with community members in remote villages since Kovind himself came from humble origin and faced several odds in his journey from the village to Rashtrapati Bhavan.
 
 Political pundits have said Kovind's candidature was a masterstroke for BJP as it woos the Dalit community, mainly in his home state of UP. However, Sonkar said elevation of Kovind should not be be seen through a political prism. “Our ideology speaks about the elevation of the last man in the row and Kovind ji is the best example of it,“ he said.A success for party's Dalit outreach: BJP SC wing
