Jehan Daruvala, Indian racing driver talks about how his life changed.

 You make your own destiny. At least, I did, when I decided to pursue racing professionally. I didn’t realise the impact it would have on me as a person and my life. From being a sheltered kid all my childhood, I was thrown into the real world at a very young age. It was scary; but it has made me who I am today. I’ve grown independent, strong and I’m ready to take on any challenge that comes my way. Being in a competitive sport has made me mature. I’ve learnt to control my emotions and frustrations that come with the ups and downs of racing. This emotional balance has become one of my biggest strengths. 
 
 I’ve also learned the hard way that nothing in life comes easy. I’ve had to sacrifice my family life, friends, food I like to eat along the way. I faced many ups and downs during my karting years (in the British KF3), but I overcame all odds and came out as a champion. Over the years, I’ve learnt to block negativity and instead of being demoralised, I only focus on moving onwards and upwards. 
 
 I discovered how to achieve success after every failure. Coming closer to success is a step-by-step process. You plan, you practise and you change. 
 
 My passion for the sport and my desire to be the best has motivated me more than ever to reach the pinnacle of the sport and remain there. My ultimate goal is to be a Formula 1 driver; but in this ultra competitive racing world, it’s going to be an uphill task. I’m going to push hard all the way, and I have to be at my physical and mental best. In a nutshell, I am fortunate than most to be living my dream. I feel exhilarated at being the driver of my fate.
