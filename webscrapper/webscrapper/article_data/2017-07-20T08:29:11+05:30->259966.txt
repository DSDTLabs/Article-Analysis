RAJKOT:   sessions court rejected a   accused’s   on Thursday. 

 According to case details, accused Sanjay   had abducted a 17-year-old girl in his autorickshaw and allegedly raped her. 
 
 Seeking Parmar’s bail, his advocate argued before the court that the victim had not been abducted, she had eloped with the accused and had consensual sex with him. 
 
 However, the government pleader argued that the victim was not old enough to decide what was right or wrong for her as she had not attained maturity at the time of the crime. Hence, if the accused was granted bail, it would set a bad precedent in the society. 
 
 Taking the government pleader’s argument into record, the sessions court in Dhoraji rejected Parmar’s bail plea.
