MUMBAI: Ticket aspirants from the Sena and the   are happy that their parties did not reach an accord on seat sharing for the civic polls and parted ways. 

 The split has kindled hopes that aspirants from both parties will get a chance to test the waters in the elections to the BMC. 
 
 Since 1997, the Sena and the BJP have contested the civic polls as allies. Since the Sena considered Mumbai as its fief, it was not keen on parting with many seats as a result the political aspiration of candidates from the BJP took a backseat.   and BJP contested the 2012 civic elections jointly, while the former put up candidates on 144 seats, the latter got only 65. “Our workers at the ground level are happy because now they may be able to contest on over 200 seats, leaving around 25 for the RPI. Earlier, our karyakartas felt that they were stifling their aspirations as the Sena got more seats. Now such feelings have abated,” said a BJP Mumbai office-bearer. “Due to the break-up with the Sena, we will have more scope to spread across Mumbai and the suburbs,” said Amarjit Mishra, Mumbai BJP general secretary.
 
 Sena has shakhas (branches) in each of the 227 wards. Local shakha pramukh hold sway over the area, iron out civic hassles an even “adjudicate” on personal disputes. Shakha pramukhs help the party connect with the constituents and reap rich dividends during elections. “Shakhas help us connect with locals,” said Suresh Kale, a Shiv Sainik since the last 43 years. Kale served as a shakha pramukh in Wadala for 23 years and is a contender for a BMC ticket. “Because of our alliance with the BJP, local Sena leaders could not grow. This will not be the case henceforth,” said Kale.
