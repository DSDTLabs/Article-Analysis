Seventeen years back,   (composer, lyricist and guitarist) and   (guitarist) met at a friend’s place to discuss work on a graphic novel. As Rahul played some tunes on the guitar the friend owned, Sukanti declared that forming a band is a better idea. From then on, they started rehearsing at Rahul’s pad and formed the first line-up. Along with   (bassist) and   (drummer, percussionist), this Kolkata-based band is a combination of traditional alt-rock and other musical and sonic influences.

 Ask them about the unusual band name, and Rahul says, “It’s the space between Saturn’s two major ring systems that appears to be void, but is actually a force field of resonating particles. Resonance being a key component of sonic vibrations, we thought it was a cool name for the group.” And what’s their USP? “Creating original music in English that is not bound by stylistic choices. We have taken the sound anywhere we thought would fit the content of the song. Rock, rap, ballads, African influences, heavy metal… we do what the song demands,” shares Sukanti.
 
 Drawing lyrical inspiration from life, society, Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Lou Majaw, they are currently working on their second album. “However, the current music scene could do with meaningful lyrics and a marriage of tradition with innovation,” feels Rahul. With the motto of ‘music never stops’, travelling to remote places like Tura, Meghalaya and   to perform in front of an audience excites the group. Says Sukanti, “To see the sheer joy that music can bring to an audience that rarely has a rock band from outside the region, performing for them is a different experience altogether.”
