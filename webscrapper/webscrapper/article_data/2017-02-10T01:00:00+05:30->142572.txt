 What is interesting about her is that she plays a unique instrument called ‘kazoo’, and has learnt to play it all by herself. Kazoo is a membranophone, a musical instrument that modifies the player’s voice by a vibrating membrane. It adds a buzzing timbral quality when vocalised. One has to ‘hum into’ it rather than ‘play it’. The instrument apparently produces different sounds to different syllables like doo, rrr, wooo or brrr.
 
  “I fell in love with its edgy sound and picked up my first kazoo in London and after many trials, I finally learnt how to play it. Over time I started playing carnatic, jazz, even saxophonic tones with it. I received much appreciation for my kazoo renditions of Ranjish Hi Sahi and Somewhere Over The Rainbow. I am often called for kazoo sessions for ad films and songs,” she signs off.
