HYDERABAD: When the   (CID) sleuths raided the   at night, they were taken aback at the sight of a snarling pack of dobermen, labradors and German shephards to keep people at bay. The dogs were trained to provide round-the-clock security at all the dens and raise an alarm. 

 The surprise element did not end there; while seizing evidence from the dens, they came across several sacks filled with condoms, which the sleuths initially thought were rice. 
 
 On questioning the accused, investigators found the racketeers were fluent in English and enjoyed all the luxuries in their house like air  ,  ,   from their racket earnings. 
 
 The NGO that tipped off the police were working on leads for the last one year and conducted several decoy operations to verify the presence of minor victims. 
 
 At the police entered the brothel houses, some of the accused claimed that the women rescued were relatives by producing fake IDs, which were kept ready with a common surname. 
 
 "These gangs have an understanding with other prostitution gangs and they even exchanged girls. We discovered that during weekends, customers would stand in queues for their turn. It also reveals how organised the operations were,'' CID in-charge Sowmya Mishra said.
 
 The role of three anti-trafficking units of CID came under the scanner as activists questioned its overdependence on NGOs to bust the organised trafficking racket, instead of acting on its own.
