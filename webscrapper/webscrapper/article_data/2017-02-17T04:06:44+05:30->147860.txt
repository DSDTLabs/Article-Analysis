CHENNAI: A public interest litigation petition in the Madras high court has challenged clearance for constructing a 112-foot Shiva   in the Velliangiri Hills by  .

 According to the president of the Velliangiri Hill Tribal Protection Society, the organisation was formed to conserve the natural resources of the hill, besides preventing encroachment. 
 
 The managing trustee of Isha Foundation, Coimbatore, had acquired land measuring 3.26 acre at Ikkarai Poluvampatti village. It had also acquired three acre of benami land in the village. According to the relevant Government Orders (GOs), the village was under the ambit of Hill Area Conservation Authority (HACA).
 
 However, Isha Foundation constructed foot Shiva without getting approval from various departments. 
 
 In its application to the town and country planning department, the foundation failed to provide a plan explaining details like parking area, administrative blocks, eateries, road access and sewerage plan. As the foundation was constructing a public building for worship, rules mandated approval from town and country planning department, hill area conservation authority and district collector.
 
 The construction also violated the provisions of Tamil Nadu Protection of Tax and Eviction of Encroachment Act, 2007. Using “muscle and money” the foundation was constructing the illegal structure, said the  .
 
 The land acquired for construction was fertile farm with standing rice crops. Despite the presence of a major irrigation channel, ‘Raja Vaikkal’ or ‘Raja Canal’, the district collector had provided certification for the area being bereft of irrigation facilities, or dependent solely on groundwater. The catchment area of the Noyyal river, the lifeline for Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts, was being obstructed by the illegal construction.
 
 The court has posted the matter for further hearing on Friday.
