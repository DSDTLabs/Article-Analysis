RANCHI: Quality coaching will be available all over the country for sportspersons who will leave a mark in internal sporting events in future, at the government's expense. 

 The state sports department, with its eyes set on the 2024 Olympics, will send promising athletes from the state for better coaching under the new "Excellence Program". 
 
 "It can be anywhere in India. If an athlete requires to train under the best coaches in the world, we will send him or her abroad as well," said sports minister Amar   Bauri in Ranchi's Suchana Bhawan on Monday evening. 
 
 Last year, during the Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, archers Deepika Kumari, Lakshmi Rani Manjhi and woman hockey player   almost won medals. According to Bauri, the success of the athlete trio gave the government to lay emphasis on sports infrastructure and prepare more medal prospects. 
 
 The department said it constituted a special fund of Rs 2 crore for this program. Athletes competing in individual and team sports will be eligible to apply for the program. A committee, constituted of former national and international sportspersons, under former Olympian hockey player  , will recommend the applications after scrutiny. 
 
 Ranendra Kumar, director of the sports directorate, said there are plans to rope in a premier hockey academy from India and archery coaches from   to train athletes.
 
 As the state is struggling due to shortage of coaches, the department on Monday said it will send former national and international athletes for degree courses in coaching. "The existing residential schools will be strengthened by good coaches and new ones will be opened shortly," Kumar said. There are 26 residential schools and 85 day boarding schools for budding athletes.
