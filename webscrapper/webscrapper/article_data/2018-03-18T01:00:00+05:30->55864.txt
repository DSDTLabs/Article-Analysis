It’s dumdaar talent on &TV’s ' ' that hit the tube last evening. But what caught our attention were the unusual and unique jodis like nanand-bhabhi (sisters-in-law), jeth-bahu (brother-in-law/sister-in-law), mother-daughter, guru-shishya and many more whose chemistry was zordaar and moves, mazzedar! Even the judges  ,   and   couldn’t help exclaiming how these relationships, interspersed with unmatched dancing, have raised their expectations of what next! While Lara, with her elegance, is fast becoming everyone’s favourite, Ahmed and Dana are leaving no stone unturned in explaining the technical aspects of this dance treat.

 Tonight’s episode of auditions is set to raise the bar yet again with some entertaining performances. 
 
 Tune in to 'High Fever… Dance Ka Naya Tevar' tonight and every Saturday-Sunday at 9.30 pm on &TV.
