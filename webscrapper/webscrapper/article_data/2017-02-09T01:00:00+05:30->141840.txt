What was supposed to be a reel accident turned real on the sets of TV show 'Beyhadh' recently. It all happened during the elaborately-planned wedding sequence of   ( ) and Arjun (Kushal Tandon). The track required a fire to break out while the couple is taking their pheras. 

 However, the accident turned real for the crew on the set at  . The fire went out of control and burnt the entire 'mandap'. We hear, a major tragedy was averted by Kushal, who pulled Jennifer out of danger in the nick of time. 
 
 Kushal who has got burns on his neck, hands and legs, told us about the accident. He said, “When I saw the entire mandap in flames, I first rushed out. Then I saw that Jennifer’s lehenga had caught fire and she was standing there hiding her face. She was scared that if she also ran out, she would fall and suffer bigger injuries. In that fraction of second, I ran inside again and pulled her out. While I tried dowsing the fire on her 'lehenga', I got burnt and   (Vajani) helped put out the fire on me. I know it sounds filmy when we narrate the incident, but thankfully we are all safe.” Jennifer who was quite shaken with the incident added, “The only reason I just stood there was because I thought if I would panic my entire wedding ensemble would catch flames. I figured one of the action directors would step in. But surprisingly, Kushal saved me.” Aneri, who also suffered burns said, “Within a few seconds, the entire mandap collapsed. Had it not been for Kushal’s presence of mind, anything could have happened.” The shooting was stalled for a couple of hours after the incident.
