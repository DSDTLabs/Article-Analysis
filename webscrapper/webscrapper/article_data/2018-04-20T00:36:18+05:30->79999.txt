NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority has set the ball rolling for the construction of a state-of-the-art football   in   Sector 19, a project that has been in the pipeline for more than six years.

  plans to build a world-class   stadium of   standards in Dwarka, with state-of-the-art playing and training facilities. The proposed stadium would be spread over 62 acres and will accommodate over 18,000 spectators. The playing field would be more than 100 metres long and nearly 70 metres wide, an official said.
 
 “We are in the process of roping in a consultant for the project and a RFP (request for proposal) has been prepared,” DDA vice-chairman Udai Pratap Singh told TOI. Work on the football stadium is expected to start this year with the process being fast-tracked.
 
 The initial cost of the stadium was pegged at around Rs 100 crore four years ago but officials from the land-owning agency said that a revised budget is yet to be finalised as the design of the stadium has been changed to make it comply with international standards.
