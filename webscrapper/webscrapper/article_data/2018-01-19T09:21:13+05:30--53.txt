On a day when the mercury soared and on-court temperature pushed 60 degrees, former No.1  , pointed at the thin line that separates testing physical limits and endangering or risking players' health. Djokovic, a six-time champion here, put out big-serving, athletic Frenchman   4-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 in a secondround clash during which both players struggled with the heat. They gasped for breath, doubled over time and again in a bid to stall play in the near-3-hour exchange. The pair served 26 doublefaults between them and didn't total even half that number for aces. It was that kind of a match, that kind of a day at Melbourne Park.

 
 One of the first things  , who opened proceedings on the Rod Laver Arena, checked when she entered the court was cold towels. Players turned to ice vests, wet towels and even doused themselves with cold water at change overs for relief on Thursday.
 
 And Friday promises to be worse. Djokovic called the conditions brutal. "We both struggled. Maybe he struggled a bit more at the end of the second set and the entire third set. At times we were both just trying to get a little bit of extra breath, a few seconds more, so we can recover."
 
 Monfils, who opened the year with a title in Doha, started well, but began to feel the heat in the second set. The Frenchman, who was being advised by the doctor, took a bathroom break at set-all. The 31-year-old said it was the hardest conditions he has ever played in. "It was tough to breathe," Monfils said, adding that it was a risk to be out in the middle. "I played two-sets-and-a-half for nothing, just to please the official. It's a bit risky."
 
 Monfils said, "I got super dizzy. I think I have a small heat stroke for 40 minutes. I try to cool down. But even with the ice towel, the water, I think my body was super warm."
 
 Chair umpire John Blom, trying to get the game going, handed Djokovic a time violation.
 
 The Serb said he didn't object to it, despite the conditions, because he was given a pre-warning. Monfils, one of the sport's characters, said, "At one stage I said to the chair umpire that the 25-second rule, there's no need. At the end, I was like, Okay, I don't want to rally so much. I want to, but I know after one or two rallies I be done."
 
 The conditions led to a debate on how much is too much and if the roof should've been rolled over. The  's extreme heat policy is to be used at the referee's discretion when the temperature exceeds 40 degrees, taking into consideration the temperature index which includes humidity.
 
 Djokovic said, "There are certain days when as a tournament supervisor, you recognize that you might need to give players a few extra hours until the temperature comes down."
 
 Defending champion   needed to knuckle down to end the feisty challenge of hardhitting German Jan-Lennard Struff with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6(4) win in the second round.
 
 One of the top gun casualties on the day was the women's third seed Garbine Muguruza who fell to Taipei's Su-Wei Hsieh 6-7 (1-7), 4-6 in a shade under two hours. Joining her on the sidelines was Briton's Johanna Konta who fell 4-6, 5-7 to American lucky loser Bernarda Pera. Among the men, seventh-seeded David Goffin was shocked by Frenchman   6-1, 6-7 (5-7), 1-6, 6-7 (4-7). Former champion and ninth seed Stan Wawrinka, coming back from knee surgery, fell 2-6, 1-6, 4-6 to American Tennys Sandgren.
 
 Fourth-seed Alexander Zverev beat big-serving German Peter Gojowczyk 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3; Fifthseeded Dominic Thiem rallied to score a 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win over American qualifier Denis Kudla; 12th seed Juan Martin Del Potro beat Russia's Karen Khachanov 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4-7), 6-4.
 
 Women's No.1 Simona Halep put out Canada's Eugenie Bouchard 6-2, 6-2; Former champion Angelique Kerber dismissed young Croat Donna Vekic 6-4, 6-1; Karolina Pliskova came through easily, beating Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maria 6-1, 6-1 in 44 minutes. 
 
 
 
 
 Melbourne: India's Rohan Bopanna and France's Edouard Roger-Vasselin, the tenth seeds in the Australian Open men's doubles draw, came through a tough first-round exercise on what was a good for Indians. The Indo-French pairing beat American Ryan Harrison and Canada's Vasek Pospisil 6-2, 7-6 (7-5).
 
 In the second round the Indo-French pairing will play Argentina's Leonardo Mayer and Joao Sousa of Portugal. India's Divij Sharan and American Rajeev Ram, seeded 16, scored a 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 win over Marius Copil of Romania and Serbian Viktor Troicki in another first round clash. The all-Indian combine of veteran Leander Paes and Purav Raja did well to move past Austria's Andreas Haider-Maurer and Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-2, 6-3.
