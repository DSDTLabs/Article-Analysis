While acting in   and   as a fraudster, actor Kunchako Boban might have not thought that he would face similar quacks in his real life. 

  56-year-old C J   from Kattappana was arrested on February 16 for allegedly cheating Mollywood actor   of Rs 25 lakh by promising investment in  .
 
  The arrest happened based on a complaint filed by the actor alleging that the accused had collected Rs 25 lakh from him a year back as his share to buy property in Puthencruz, Kochi worth Rs 50 lakh.
 
  Varghese was supposed to pay the amount in advance. He had agreed to invest the remaining Rs 25 lakh but didn't do so even after three-month period specified in the agreement with the landowner. And though the landowner returned Rs 15 lakh since the deal did not occur, Varghese did not pay the money back to the actor.
 
  A cheque he later gave Boban bounced. He also offered a property he owned at Kanchiyar to Boban. This, too, could not take off as the land was pledged to a bank.
