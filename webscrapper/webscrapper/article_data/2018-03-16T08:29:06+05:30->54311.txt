PUNE: A sessions court here has convicted and sentenced a 50-year-old man to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment for repeatedly raping his minor sister-in-law for more than two years after she attained puberty.

 The incident came to light in April 2015. Additional sessions judge   found the accused guilty of the offence under Section 376 (2) (f) (i) of the Indian Penal Code which refers to   on a woman by a relative or a person in a position of trust or authority towards such woman and rape when the woman is below 16 years of age.
 
 Similarly, the court also found the accused guilty of offence under Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act which deals with sexual assault. The court sentenced the accused to 10 years’ rigorous jail for IPC as well as POCSO offences. The sentences are to run concurrently.
 
 According to the prosecution, the girl did not go to any school and assisted her brother-in-law in masonry work. After she attained puberty, her brother-in-law started sexually exploiting her for almost two years till the girl, fed up with his acts, left the house in April 2015. The girl was found wandering around   when a police constable took her to his senior inspector and the latter assigned a policewoman to ascertain the reason for her woes. 
 
 During the trial, the accused took a defence that she had falsely implicated him when he asked her to leave their home on learning about her relations. 
 
 The court cited the medical evidence and also observed that no woman would put her chastity at stake by falsely implicating a person for matters like forcibly taking away her earnings.
