NOIDA:   Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the Eastern and Western peripheral expressways simultaneously after March 15, officials privy to information on the projects have said.

 The   and the   will connect NH-1 and NH-2 from the western and eastern side of Delhi. The 135km EPE is expected to divert around 2 lakh vehicles that would have otherwise passed through the national capital, considerably cutting down pollution. It envisages signal-free connectivity between Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gautam Budh Nagar ( ) and Palwal. 
 
 Officials in the National Highways Authority of India said a proposal had been submitted to increase the speed limit to 120kmph on the EPE. If cleared, the speed limit will be the first for any expressway in the country.
 
 The officials said they also planned to install the country’s first closed tolling system on the expressway, under which booths will collect toll on the basis of the distance travelled and not the entire length.
 
 Currently, the speed limit for passengers vehicles on Indian expressways in 100kmph. The recommendations about increasing the speed limit and installing the closed toll system had been made by a committee constituted by the Union road transport ministry.
 
 “Once opened for traffic, we will not charge toll from travellers as soon as they enter the e-way but only when they exit it. Commuters will be given tokens on entering and they will have to be shown at the toll plaza at the time of exiting,” said Kishore Kanyal, the project director of EPE.
 
 “The proposals will also ensure there is no traffic congestion at the eight interchanges,” he added.
 
 The officials said there would be eight toll plazas along the expressway at Sonipat, Baghpat, Ghaziabad (2), Gautam Budh Nagar (3) and Faridabad. The booths will start collecting toll once all the facilities are in place. The high-speed stretch will also be monitored by around 300 CCTV cameras on both carriageways.
