VISAKHAPATNAM: The city police arrested four persons on Sunday for their involvement in the murder of former corporator Chilla  . She was smothered to death by the accused for property gains. 

 Satyavathi was found dead in her three-storied building at Allipuram five days ago and following investigations and leads provided by forensic experts, the police suspected murder rather than natural death.
 
 Speaking to the media here, deputy commissioner of police (law and order)   said the accused have been identified as 25-year-old  , his wife   and two minor sons, who had been living as tenants at Satyavathiâ€˜s residence.
 
 Raju, a daily wage worker, had hatched a plan to eliminate Satyavathi and sent his youngest son to stay with her. The boy was given a mobile phone and Raju asked him to call once Satyavathi was asleep.
 
 Subsequently, Nagaraju smothered the woman to death with a pillow and returned to their room with gold ornaments. However, based on forensic clues, the police were able to nab the accused.
