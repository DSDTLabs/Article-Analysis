PANAJI: The chances of pulling grounded vessel,  , after two months at   have brightened with the range of the tide likely to get larger during the next few days, company officials said on Friday. On Saturday, the high tide will touch 1.90m. On other days its range will be 1.99m on Sunday, 2.06m on Monday and the highest of 2.12m on Tuesday. “We are positive that we will be able to pull it into deeper waters for an underwater survey to carry out further repairs,” a source said.

 Two tugs of 60 tonnes and 22 tonnes have been requisitioned, while a third one on standby, if needed, to pull the vessel, which suffered much damage during the peak monsoon season.
 
 While being towed into   in mid-July despite warnings by captain of ports citing unfavourable conditions, the vessel hit a sand bar and drifted to Miramar beach.
 
 Within a week, the shoreline showed some changes, as a stretch of the beach for about 100 metres started retreating towards land. This was due to obstruction of the vessel to wave dissipation on the beach. But the dent in the shore has changed while there have been also other changes, as the vessel shifted gradually towards the northern part of the beach.
 
 No attempt was made to pull the vessel out on Friday.
