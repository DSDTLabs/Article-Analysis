Sundeep, who stick to experimenting with characters since the beginning of his career looks like he is in no way letting it go when coming to taking up assignments that help establish him in both Tamil and Telugu industries. 

 While the actor is currently shooting for a bilingual film titled 'Aram Seidhu Pazhgu' under the direction of national award winning director Suseenthiran, buzz is that the actor also jumped at the opportunity to work with another Tamil film maker Thiru. 
 
 Thiru has worked with actor Vishal for three of his films and has created an image for himself. The movie is again said to be a bilingual.
