 Chennai: Adding strength to the opposition, AIADMK dissident leader and R K Nagar MLA TTV Dhinakaran said if the DMK moved a no-confidence motion in the assembly, he would support it. Emerging from the assembly hall, after the governor’s address on Monday, V K Sasikala’s nephew Dhinakaran told reporters, “There is nothing wrong in joining hands with the opposition to do good things”.
 
 Dhinakaran on Monday made his debut in the assembly, creating quite a buzz in the political corridors. The ruling AIADMK ignored him totally, but the opposition, DMK and Congress besides AIADMK’s erstwhile allies, greeted him on the floor of the house. 
 
 Accompanied by his supporters, V T Kalaiselvan (Vridhachalam MLA) and E Rathinasabapathy (Aranthangi), Dhinakaran was all smiles when he entered the assembly hall, much ahead of the start of the session. Taking the seat of his supporter and disqualified MLA P Vetrivel, the rebel leader reciprocated as Congress MLAs greeted him.
 
 DMK MLAs and former ministers K N Nehru, M R K Panneerselvam and S Raghupathy also greeted him. Ruling party MLAs and ministers, including chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, avoided eye contact with Dhinakaran. After the opposition MLAs walked out of the house, Dhinakaran was seated all alone until the governor’s address ended.
 
 In the morning, as soon as he arrived in the assembly lobby, his supporters raised slogans hailing him as the future chief minister of the state. Even as he walked into the assembly hall, his supporters tried to follow him but were stopped at gate 4. An argument broke out between the disqualified MLAs, who were in black shirts, and policemen. They showed their ID cards and demanded that they be permitted to enter the lobby, but policemen refused to allow them anywhere near the assembly hall.
