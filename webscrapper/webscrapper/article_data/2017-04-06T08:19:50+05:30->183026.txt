LUCKNOW: The issue of Babri Masjid and   should be settled out of court on the negotiation table and not on the streets amid politically motivated slogan-shouting, said members of the   (AISPLB), in Lucknow, on Wednesday. 

 Conducting its executive meeting at Shia PG College, the board also demanded the Central government form a stringent law against the arbitrary triple talaq in-one-sitting, on the lines of Sati prohibition. 
 
 Discussing other controversial issues, the board reiterated that cow slaughter and eating cow meat was ‘forbidden’ if it hurts people’s sentiments and appealed for a complete ban on cow slaughter across India. “Recently, we sent a query on the issue of cow slaughter in India that at times leads to violence and communal disharmony to Iraq-based Ayatullah Bashir Al Najafi. He replied saying it was ‘haraam’ (forbidden) if human blood is at stake over animal blood and we should be considerate towards our countrymen,” said board spokesperson  .
 
 The board also demanded separate commission to decipher social, religious and economic issues of the Shia community be formed by Union government, since the   formed under   had left the community out. “Whether the committee’s findings were implemented or not is not our concern. There should now be a different committee for rights of Shias,” added Abbas.
