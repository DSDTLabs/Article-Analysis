HYDERABAD: In their rebuttal submitted to the Guntur collector on Friday, the family of   denied the findings of the district-level scrutiny committee (DLSC), which took the view they are not Dalits. 

 Rohith, a PhD scholar at the  , had committed suicide on the varsity premises, on January 17 last year. 
 
 The family's rebuttal comes over a month after collector Kanthilal Dande issued a showcause notice to Radhika and   seeking clarification as to why they should not be declared as other backward class (OBC). 
 
 While the DLSC has proposed cancellation of their scheduled caste (SC) certificate, the final decision lies with the collector. He is expected to deliver his verdict after scrutinising the family's submission. 
 
 In their 30-page rebuttal, the family has, meanwhile, contradicted the findings of the committee and have submitted documents to back their claims. "We have submitted statements by locals, living in the same area as the Vemula family, who have declared that they are Dalits," said the family's counsel Bhim Rao. 
 
 While the committee in its report has enclosed Raja's (Rohith's brother) birth certificate as proof that he belongs to OBC, the family in its rebuttal has produced his paternal grandfather's letter, which states otherwise. "In a letter to the collector, the grandfather himself had stated that Radhika and her children both belonged to the SC community and that he himself had submitted the application for Raja's birth certificate in   panchayat of Guntur district," said Rao. 
 
 The family's recent submission also comprises Rohith's father  's statement made before the media soon after his son's death. "Mani Kumar himself said how he left the the family 30 years ago and had no connection with them. In this case, Radhika's caste was passed on to the children," said Rao.
