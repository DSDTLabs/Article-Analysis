PANAJI: The width of three important bunds, Palni, Pachlai Palni and   in   will be maintained at 3.5 metres, but no rubble soling and asphalting will be allowed on the road above these barriers against tidal influence.

 Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) has accepted the recommendations of the water resources department (WRD) at its 170th meeting recently. The civil works to repair the bunds and dumping of massive quantities of mud had sparked off a controversy, as islanders of St Estevam villagers had alleged that roads were being built under the garb of strengthening them. 
 
 Activist, late Fr Bismarque Dias and Mateus Saldanha had filed complaints before the national green tribunal (NGT), challenging the work being done by the agriculture department’s soil conservation division. They had alleged that mangroves had been felled and dumping of red mud would adversely affect the khazan land, mangroves and ecosystem.
 
 After NGT’s direction, a GCZMA expert member, Antonio Mascarenhas had inspected the bunds in February 2016, and had found road metal and basaltic material dumped on bunds and extensive reclamation in CRZ 1 area. 
 
 He had recommended in his report submitted to NGT that the red mud be removed carefully, bunds width be reduced to the original status and locally available clayey material be used.
 
 But while some office bearers of the bund’s tenants associations said broader bunds were needed to withstand the tidal force, some activists wanted reduction of the bund width to 2.5 metres.
 
 The WRD official said that barge movement is causing turbulence of water and leading to breaches. Making a bund with traditional method of silt and grass is not possible due to lack of such skilled manpower. 
 
 GCZMA accepted the recommendations, but restricted the width to 3.5 metres, without soling or tarring.
