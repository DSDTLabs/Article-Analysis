 Working women prefer to cook tasty, but less time consuming dishes while keeping in mind the calorie content in the food they make.  , a teacher from  , said, "After breaking the fast, people have a tendency to gorge on full meal cooked with fats and unsaturated oil to bring the typical taste of iftaar. While in my family we are very strict about our daily diet during Ramzan because greasy food causes fatigue and gives trouble while offering namaz, we take lots of fresh fruit juices and green leafy vegetables to cleanse our digestive tracts. The age-old tradition of greasy meal meant for iftaar is now slowly decreasing and people are instead trying to be more health conscious by opting for baked dishes and green leafy vegetables." Afsana Sheikh, another homemaker from  , has restricted her family's diet even for suhoor, the early morning meal.
