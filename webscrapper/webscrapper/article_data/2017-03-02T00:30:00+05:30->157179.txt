Bengaluru: The cabinet on Wednesday decided to bury the 2011-batch KAS recruitment controversy by not going for an appeal against the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal (KAT) order. The KAT had quashed the state government’s decision to annul the recruitment to 362 posts of gazetted probationers (Group A and B).

 The U-turn comes three years after the state government spiked the final selection list on grounds of corruption and nepotism during interviews conducted by the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC). 
 
 “We will not file an appeal against the KAT in the high court. The appointment letters will be sent to the selected candidates,” law minister T B Jayachandra told reporters. 
 
 The moves is a breather for the 362 candidates as their careers would have been at stake had the government decided to file an appeal in the high court. The recruitment process pertaining to the 2011 batch got mired in a controversy after H P S Mythri, one of the candidates, alleged malpractices and corruption in the interview process and submitted a representation to the advocate general. The government had ordered a probe by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) into the final selection list prepared by the KPSC. Based on the CID’s interim report, the government cancelled the selection process in August 2014 after it was found that 46 candidates had indulged in malpractices. However, the aggrieved candidates filed an appeal in KAT stating that it was not fair to punish everyone for the malpractices, if committed, by a few. The KAT quashed the government order in October 2016 and directed the department of personnel and administrative reforms (DPA) to issue appointment orders to the selected candidates in two months. 
 
 The KAT had observed that if the state government is not satisfied, it may investigate into the allegations made by candidates. “After the inquiry and verification, the government has to segregate tainted and non-tainted candidates. There was no attempt made to such an exercise before cancelling the process. The cancellation of the entire selection is illegal,” it had noted. 
 
 Following this, pressure started mounting on the government from the candidates and political leaders, including former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy. Though a majority of the Congressmen were in favour of going on appeal against the KAT order as the recruitments had happened during the BJP regime, the Siddaramaiah government chose not to go for an appeal as it would delay all the state-level appointments. 
 
 “We have not appointed any KAS (Karnataka Administrative Service) officer so far because of this confusion. We have now accepted the KAT verdict and will go ahead with appointments,” Jayachandra added.
