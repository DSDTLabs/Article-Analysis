NAVI MUMBAI:   residents continue to bear the brunt of bad roads and poorly maintained sewage and stormwater lines even after 7 months of the node being transferred from Cidco to NMMC. 

  Residents have been complaining that potholes have surfaced on nodal roads, exposing the shoddy patch work done by NMMC as part of its pre-monsoon preparations. 
 
 Even the   body has not been clearing the garbage regularly or removing encroachments from the footpaths. 
 
 However, NMMC executive engineer   said, “But most roads are in better shape this year as compared to previous seasons. Asphalting was carried out on many roads before the monsoon. During Cidco’s regime the infrastructure was in a mess. However, we have redressed most of the issues.” 
 
 Contrary to the civic body’s claim, one of the residents, Ranjit Jadhav, said, “We are left to live in the dream’s paradise that we will have primary facilities after NMMC taking over the node, but that did not happen. Both the agencies are the same. NMMC has neglected the area as Cidco did for last two decades. We have no proper roads, streetlights or drainage.” 
 
  An NMMC official said the pothole-filling work is on as a temporary arrangement. The civic body plans to develop the node on the lines of Belapur’s sector 15 area.
