JHANSI: Referring to the infamous guest house incident of 1995 when   was locked up in a room as   leaders paraded outside, Union minster   said that if the BSP chief was attacked again by SP leaders she could come to her.

 Addressing a public meeting here on Friday, the   MP said, “She can take my number, I will come and save her. Last time it was   who had saved her from SP workers’ wrath, this time she can take my help.”
 
 She hit out at the BSP chief while commenting on the former’s decision to support SP candidates in the forthcoming   and Phulpur bypolls, slated to be held on March 11.
