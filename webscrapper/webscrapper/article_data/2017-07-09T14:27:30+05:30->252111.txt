 legend   said he loves rap music and considers the genre to be urban poetry. 

  
  
 The 75-year-old music legend said he was blown away when he saw Jay-Z and Kanye's West's join 2011 "Watch the Throne" tour and thinks people write off the genre too easily as a lot of "swearing and bravado".
 
 "It's a funny thing. A lot of people look at rap and think 'Ah yeah, well it's just a lot of swearing and cussing, and bravado'. But seeing the show, it's a lot of poetry. I was impressed. I think seeing a whole show, you get a better idea of what it is they're on about. So I enjoyed the show."
 
 "It's urban poetry, you know? When you see the show, you get a little bit of time to sit back and look at the songs and what they're talking about and what they mean".
