BATHINDA: Taking note of ‘goonda tax’ allegedly being extorted from transporters at Guru Gobind Singh Refinery, near Bathinda, the leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly   has asked the Congress government to release a white paper on the issue.   said the state government should investigate who were behind its collection. 

 The   (AAP) leader asked the government to make public the names of politicians at whose behest ‘goonda tax’ was being collected and that the money collected under it in the previous years should be recovered from them. 
 
 Khaira, along with party MLAs, visited the refinery on Monday evening and held a meeting with the officials. He said he would take up the matter in the upcoming budget session of the state Assembly.
 
 Khaira told the TOI, “Collection of ‘goonda tax’ is a blot on the face of Punjab as it is dissuading industrialists from setting up units in the state. Punjab is losing investment due to it. Punjab chief minister Captain   has admitted that ‘goonda tax’ is being collected and has directed the DGP to control it. But despite that, the illegal tax is being collected by the henchmen of Congress leaders. Earlier, the Akali leaders were collecting it, and now the Congress leaders are minting money. All this should stop so that confidence of investors could be revived and Punjab could get investment.”
