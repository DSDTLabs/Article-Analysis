HYDERABAD: Chief minister   on Tuesday claimed that the   would win 106 out of 119 seats in the 2019 Assembly elections. This was revealed, he said, in a survey in the state. 

 Addressing a public meeting in Adilabad, the chief minister again criticised the Centre for not increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for various produce. Using typical Telangana jargon, KCR questioned as to how big the loss would be if the Centre hiked the MSP. "Farmers are being neglected. We will fight together to get what is due for them," he said. 
 
 In a reference to the violence that broke out between Adivasis and   in Adilabad some months ago, KCR blamed 'some parties' for trying to create differences between the two groups. 
 
 The CM announced that a domestic air strip would be constructed near Adilabad town on 350 acres. He also promised to set up a junior college with Marathi as medium of instruction in view of the sizable Marathi populace. A townhall too would be constructed. 
 
 Chandrasekhar Rao's speech was interrupted time and again by people shouting. The upset CM asked the police the reason for the shouting. When told, KCR asked: "So why should they shout?" An angry KCR even asked the noisemakers to shut up, but in vain.
