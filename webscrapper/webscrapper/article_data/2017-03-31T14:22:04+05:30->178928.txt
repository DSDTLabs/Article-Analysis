NEW DELHI: Union home minister   reached out to the youth of Jammu and Kashmir and asked them not to protest against security forces in the valley. The minister's statement comes a day after J&K police chief said that young men in Kashmir were committing suicide by rushing to encounter sites and throwing stones at security forces.

 Rajnath Singh, while speaking in Lok Sabha, said, “I feel that the youth of Jammu and Kashmir, who resort to stone pelting, are being brainwashed by certain forces that are in Pakistan. I would like to appeal to them not to be swayed by Pakistan. Pakistan is trying to destabilise India in this way."
 
 In a stern message to terrorists, Rajnath Singh stated that the Army is dealing with terrorists the way they have to be dealt with.
 
 “Our soldiers are dealing with terrorism the way it has to be dealt with. We are doing it now and we will keep on doing so,” Rajnath Singh said.
 
 Singh directly accused several Pakistan-based social media groups for egging Kashmiri youth. “Groups on social media such as WhatsApp and Facebook are being used to instigate the youth and a crowd is brought together. These groups on social media are operated by people living in Pakistan,” he said.
 
 Three civilians were killed while around 18 others were injured in protests that broke out very close to the encounter site in   last week, with protesters pelting stones at the security forces, allegedly to help the terrorist to escape.
 
 The Army Chief General Bipin Rawat had warned stone-pelters, stating that those obstructing anti-terror operations of the Army in the Kashmir valley will be treated as anti-nationals and will be dealt with accordingly.
