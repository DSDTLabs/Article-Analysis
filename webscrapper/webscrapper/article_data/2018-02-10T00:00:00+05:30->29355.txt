An HR training professional by the day and a filmmaker by choice, Rajesh Rajan’s latest video,  , is a take on sexual and  . As hard hitting as the lyrics and the visuals are, Rajesh says that he never wanted to be preachy through the video, but in fact, wanted to address the issue in a realistic yet cinematic manner.
What prompted him to make a video on sexual and physical abuse? “We read about such incidents on a daily basis and it angers us all. We all have a different reaction ranging from anger to frustration and we know that it has been happening for a very long time and that prompted me to make a video on the subject. I don’t want to preach through the video. It’s an emotional reaction to incidents like these and that’s what I wanted to show through it,” says Rajesh.
 Rajesh, who has acted, directed, produced and even sung for the video, says that the video has a very unique way of story-telling. “Kaateri is the 64th form of the Divine Spirit and in English, it literally means vampire. If you look at the lyrics, it’s about Kaateri punishing people for their wrong-doing. The way I’ve even sung the song is unique,” he says.
 The video, he adds, has been shot entirely in Bengaluru and over a year and a half of preparations have gone into it. “Though the shooting took only four days, the pre-production and post production took a long time. Initially, I had approached well known names to act in the video, but due to certain reasons it didn’t work out ,” he says, adding that the technicians who’ve worked on the video have done an excellent job. “The people who’ve worked on this video are excellent in their respective fields and usually do not take on any project unless they know that the matter is substantial. Such is their caliber,” he says.
 Ask him about his future plans, and Rajesh says. “I want to get into filmmaking and I hope that this video can speak volumes. I also hope to act and direct movies in the future,” he sums up.
