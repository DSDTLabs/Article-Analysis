THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the state   approving a proposal by the director of medical education to spend Rs 11.87 crore for the   of all government   hospitals in the state, the old rusty cots and beds and shabby and unhygienic wards and toilets there may well be a thing of the past.

 The finance department has already released the fund for the project titled ‘creation of patient-friendly hospital environment’.
 
 Special waiting and dining areas will be provided for bystanders in all MCHs so that they don’t have food inside the wards and corridors of the hospitals. In addition to this, more canteen facilities will also be provided there.
 
 All rusty cots and old beds and bedsheets will be replaced as part of the plan. More laundry and automatic cleaning facilities will be provided, apart from floor cleaning and sweeping machines. The fund will also be spent to buy water purifiers that can dispense hot water and movable dustbins to be installed in wards to avoid littering.
 
 Modern wheelchairs, patient-friendly cushioned trolleys, patient transfer cum emergency care ICU beds with x-ray compatibility for trauma care victims, etc will be the other facilities that will be provided.
 
 The OP wings will now be having public address system with electronic display boards in addition to the   surveillance to monitor the movement of the people. All the waiting areas of the patients will get television sets. In addition to this, the project also envisages new toilet facilities, fresh look for wards with paintings, new floors and new lighting system.
