 comes to Anika in an emotional state. He takes her to the kitchen and begins to feed her. He is shaken by what Bajaj had told him. Anika is surprised by this sudden change in Shivaay. 

 Shivaay then goes to Rudra and confides in him. He tells her how he feels guilty for trying to know about Anika's background, when he was the one who had forced her to get married to him. Rudra advises Shivaay to keep Anika happy henceforth. Shivaay resolves to do so. 
 
 
  
 Pinky calls Shivaay to inform him the puja will take place the next day. Shivaay tells her to cancel it. Pinky acts as if she doesn't know anything. She tells him that now they don't have a problem with Anika's background as she is the granddaughter of Mr. Bajaj. Shivaay confesses that she is not. 
 
 Later, Shivaay gets a call from the orphanage and the lady tells him that she has got details of Anika's mom. Shivaay is initially reluctant but then goes to the mentioned place. He finds prostitutes asking him for money. All this is basically Pinky's plan to mislead Shivaay.
