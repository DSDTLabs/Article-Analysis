NEW DELHI: Days after he was sacked from the Delhi cabinet,   MLA   alleged that health minister   was involved in a Rs 300-crore “scam”. He claimed that the scam pertained to procurement of “unwanted medicines”. 

 Besides this, Mishra alleged that 100 ambulances were purchased for Rs 23 lakh each, while an automobile company was ready to supply the vehicles for Rs 11 lakh each. He also alleged Jain’s involvement in transfer and posting of doctors in violations of standard rules. “Many junior doctors were promoted and appointed as medical superintendents superseding many seniors,” he said. 
 
 TOI could not independently verify the documents Mishra presented before media to back his claims. However, AAP dismissed the charges, saying they “were nothing but entertainment for the media”.
 
 “In an interview to a newspaper, Jain claimed that he earmarked a budget of Rs 300 crore for advance purchase of medicines. Now,   is saying that the hospitals do not have medicines. This is a scam,” Mishra said during a press conference at his residence on Saturday.
 
 He alleged that “on the pretext to fight dengue and chikungunya, Jain ordered advance procurement of medicines for six months even though the hospitals did not need those medicines”. The medicines were “dumped in three warehouses, which lack facilities to safely store medicines,” he added. 
 
 Jain did not answer calls made by TOI. Even texts sent to him did not elicit any response.
