BHOPAL: After BJP’s landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections, former chief minister   said that with Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, the party will win the 2018 assembly elections with a three-fourth majority in the state. 

 “It has been an unprecedented win in Uttar Pradesh, in a state where the party was finding it hard to reach a majority,” the veteran BJP leader said. “This is the victory and magic of the `mahanayak’ (great chief – Narendra Modi) and his senapati (commander-in-chief) Amit Shah,” he said.
 
 Gaur argued that whatever rival political parties may say, the environment in the country is in full favour of the BJP. “Narendra Modi is here to stay and not just for the next 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He will be Prime Minister for much longer than that,” he added.
