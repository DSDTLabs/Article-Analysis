MADURAI:   Makkal Sangam, a new movement, was launched in Madurai on Sunday. Launching it, convenor of the lawyer's wing of the movement, P Rathinam said that it will work for uplifting the downtrodden communities and also stand up for the rights of all. 

 "We chose the name of Bhagat Singh because he was a staunch patriot and nationalist from the age of 21. He is relevant even today and is a role-model for today's youth," he said.
 
 The meeting resolved to abolish caste discrimination in the society and also fight corruption in Tamil Nadu with an iron hand. The movement would also fight for total prohibition for a better society. 
 
 The present day legal aid centres continue to confine their activities to functions and ceremonies, Rathinam said. "We plan to set up legal committees across the state, which will help ordinary people seek justice," he said.
 
 The organisation also resolved to support Justice  , who was criticised for making comments on late chief minister  's death. 
 
 The party' flag, red in colour with a chakra in the centre, was unfurled at the meeting. "Red stands for socialism and equality, and the chakra, the beginning," Rathinam added.
 
 Advocate   welcomed the gathering. Advocate Yuvaraj proposed a vote of thanks.
