On the occasion of International   today, Google has decided to feature the work of 12   from around the world through interactive doodles. Each element, in the form of a visual narrative, represents a moment, person, or event that has impacted lives of these women.

  The inspiring messages have been translated into more than 80 languages and shared on Google's search page in countries around the world.
 
  
  
  Among these 12 doodles, there is one by a Bengaluru based comics artist and illustrator,  , titled “Up on the Roof”. This   is about a girl who reads books on her terrace and with every page that she completes, she grows wings that help her take flight.
 
  Google has also encouraged other women across the world to share their own personal stories with the hashtag #HerStoryOurStory on Twitter.
 
  
  
  Google says that it has been moved by the candor, intimacy, and bravery of these stories.
 
  “We hope that the combined power of words and images help bring these stories to life in a way that invokes feelings of understanding, empathy, and spirit of the day,” read a statement from Google.
 
  International Women’s Day came into existence more than a century ago after more than 15,000 women marched in   to demand better working conditions and voting rights.
