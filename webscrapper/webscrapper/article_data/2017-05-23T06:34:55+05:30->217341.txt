HYDERABAD: A person whose Innova vehicle was sporting a fake registration number was arrested by   police on Saturday. The arrest was based on a tip-off by an individual who actually owns another Innova with the real number. 

 Cyberabad police, in an official release issued here on Monday, said that G   of   owns an Innova vehicle with registration number TS07EC3663 and it was being used for company work. Sometime ago, Veeresh received three e-challans for various traffic violations. When he looked through the  , he found that the erring vehicle was a silver colour one, but their company's Innova was white. "On Monday, Veeresh spotted the Innova bearing the same registration number as his vehicle. He immediately called 'Dial 100' number and police caught the vehicle with the help of a patrol team at Balanagar,'' the release said.
 
 The accused using the fake number was one Rafiyuddin and a case was registered against him.
