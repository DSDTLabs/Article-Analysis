  : The state government has asked all officials - from district magistrates to block development officers - to meet people at least once a week and take steps to address their grievances. 

 A notification issued by the general administration department says, "The offices should fix timings to address public grievances and (it) should be done at least once a week. The day of the week fixed for the meeting has to be given proper publicity." It also seeks that the officials send action taken reports to the general administration in the first week of every month.
 
 In addition to holding public meetings, district magistrates, additional district magistrates and deputy commissioners have to visit at least one subdivision and one rural development block every month. Subdivisional judicial magistrates have to visit at least one block every month while block development officers have to visit all panchayats and village councils once a month. Secretaries have also been asked to monitor administrative activities, visit the districts and hold meetings with officials.
 
 Chief minister Biplab   had already put in place a system of accountability for ministers and legislators, making it mandatory for them to meet the people thrice a week. "This is a model of decentralization to speed up developmental activities of the state. Neither the chief minister nor other ministers and legislators were elected to sit in offices. People elected us to serve them," Deb said.
 
 To reach out to party workers,   ministers have been asked to sit in party offices for two hours twice a week to listen to the grievances of party cadres.
