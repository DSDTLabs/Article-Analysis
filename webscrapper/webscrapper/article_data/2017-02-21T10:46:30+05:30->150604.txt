CHENNAI: With the closure of 500   in the state,   revenue is likely to come down by Rs 60 crore each year. With this order, the number of   in the state will be around 5,700. “Total prohibition is Amma’s motto and we are taking forward her principle,” the chief minister   said after signing this order. 

 The state earned Rs25,846 crore from excise revenue and sales tax from liquor sales during last fiscal, a 77% increase in the last decade. AIADMK’s electoral promise was to reduce the number of outlets, closure of bars and setting up of rehabilitation centres for addicts, before introducing total prohibition. The liquor shops will be closed based on the recommendations of the district collectors. 
 
 At first, liquor outlets in rural areas will be identified and closed as the revenue from these shops are low compared to those in urban areas. “We are yet to identify the shops which will have to be closed. Announcement on the number of shops to be closed in various districts will be done after a month. Each shop earns around Rs1 lakh and during weekend it will be more. But closing the shop depends on the location, whether that shop is in urban or rural areas,” said a senior Tasmac official.
 
 Around 30% of the state’s revenue comes from over 6,000 Tasmac outlets. Before May 2016, the daily turnover of these outlets was between Rs68-70 crore per day, with weekend sales touching Rs90 crore. In the financial year 2015-16, Tasmac earned Rs 26,188 crore, which did not dip too much after the first round of closures last year.
