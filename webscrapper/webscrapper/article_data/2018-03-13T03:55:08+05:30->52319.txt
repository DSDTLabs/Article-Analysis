The   exam's   had four printing errors and students who attempted them will get seven bonus marks. The paper was held on February 28. 

 At a meeting of chief moderators last week, it was decided to recommend seven bonus marks for the errors. 
 
 A chief moderator said question 2 (2) read: 'Give two uses...' instead of 'give its two uses' (referring to thermodynamics). Also, question 3 (4), mentioned 'Calculate change in internal energy', but it was printed as 'Calculate internal energy', said   of Sathaye College, Vile Parle. Students will get bonus marks here. In question 6 (4), a chemical equation asked was out-of-syllabus for which students will be given two bonus marks and in question 8 (b), the equation of isocyanide was asked in a wrong pattern for which one bonus mark will be awarded. 
 
 General secretary of   teachers' Organisation, Anil Deshmukh, said, "These minor misprints change the meaning of the questions."
 
 Deshmukh said even those who just wrote the question and left it blank could to get bonus marks. State board secretary Krishnakumar Patil said, "We are still to receive a recommendation from the moderators."
