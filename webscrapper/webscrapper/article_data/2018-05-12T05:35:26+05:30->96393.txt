AHMEDABAD: The   high court on Friday issued notices to the state government and other authorities concerned, over a public interest litigation ( ) demanding that poor children be given free admission to preschools under the Right to Education Act ( ).

 The petitioner, Chandravadan Dhruv, took exception to the present method of granting free admission to poor children on 25% of the seats at private schools under RTE laws. 
 
 He submitted that the government grants admission in class I to poor children under RTE laws and also advertises so.The petitioner urged the high court to direct the state government to implement the RTE Act properly and provide for free admission to preschools, nurseries and kindergartens at “associate” schools. These are the schools run by a trust or company that also runs preschools. These preschools are thus associated with the primary and secondary sections. The petitioner contends that section 12(1)(A) of the RTE Act clearly provides for the right of a poor child to free education in the preschool section at schools.
 
 Dhruv said he made representations to all the authorities concerned in the state government, including the chairman of Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, but did not get a response. The high court has sought a reply from the state government in the second week of June. Meanwhile, Sandip Munjyasara, a student at   (GFSU), also sought directions from the HC for transparency in the implementation of RTE laws.
