NOIDA: The family members of Gazhal, a student of DPS World School Noida Extension, have written to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, seeking his intervention in a fair probe. 

 Gazhal passed away on Tuesday after she reportedly received injuries at a   competition in her school. However, the school management denied any role in it.
 
 Lal Chand Yadav, Gazhal’s father said that he is not satisfied with the police probe so far. “The police have registered an FIR against five officials of the school. However, they have not questioned them or detained them for investigation,” Yadav said.
 
 He said that he had also met district magistrate N P Singh and superintendent of police (rural) Sujata Singh and lodged a complaint.
 
 The district magistrate said that the student’s family met him on Sunday. “I listened to their grievances at length and instructed the SP Rural to do a qualitative investigation into the matter and do justice. I have also talked to the SSP Gautam Budh Nagar about the same,” he said.
 
 The family members have also launched a social media campaign on Facebook, Twitter seeking justice for Gazhal. 
 
 Awdhesh Awasthi, SHO Eco-Tech III police station said, “The police are also recording the statements of the accused named in the FIR. We are also collecting evidences and analyzing the same. We will take suitable action once we get concrete evidence,” he said.
