KOCHI: Former GCDA chairman   said that the allegations of him acquiring the furniture from the official residence of   (GCDA) chairman as well as of GCDA losing land during his tenure are baseless. 

  " I have not taken anything away from the residence for personal use. An inquiry should be held to check where the officials erred. The keepers of the key after I moved out are the ones who are to be questioned," said Venugopal. He added that the current chairman   approves of his incorruptibility in the matter. He was speaking at a press conference at the Ernakulam Press Club on Tuesday.
 
  "It was during the occupancy of the previous authorities the GCDA that land was misappropriated," Venugopal added.
