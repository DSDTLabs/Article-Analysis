CHANDIGARH: Day one of the   concept launched in  , including Chandigarh, witnessed   as most of the consumers were caught unawares about the move. State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd ( ) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), which own over 95 per cent of nearly 58,000 petrol pumps in the country, launched a pilot project for daily price revision of petrol and diesel in five select cities from Monday.

 As TOI conducted reality checks in the city, people gave mixed response to the concept. Most of the people found the concept of calculating fuel rates on a daily basis confusing and not customer friendly. They termed it as another task in their daily busy schedule to remember or inquire about the fuel rates. However, the consumers seemed happy that they won’t be subjected to steep hike in fuel rates anymore.
 
 All the retail outlets (ROs) will be informed about the next changed rates via email or SMS daily and also by dealers mobile application ‘xsparsh’ by 8 pm to be made applicable by midnight. A retail outlet owner said, “We have received instructions in writing from IOC about the effectiveness of changed rates on a daily basis. Every day by 8 pm, we will receive new rates, whether up or down, which will be displayed by LED boards and will be made affective by midnight.”
