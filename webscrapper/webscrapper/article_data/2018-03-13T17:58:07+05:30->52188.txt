  Juned, a runner from Palwal, who finished 1st in the 21km, said, “This was my first trail run and I enjoyed it. I am used to running on the roads, but this was a new experience. I loved the challenge and adventure here.” While most were in competitive mode, several runners participated just to be close to nature and have fun. Hemant Singh, a Gurgaon resident, said, “Trail Run is something that takes you close to nature.
