SURAT: More than 3.25 lakh people have visited the four recreational facilities in the last one-and-half-month of summer vacations for schools in the city and the number is expected to cross 5 lakh by May-end. 

 An income of around Rs 1 crore in two months for   from entry fee collection at the recreational facilities was unthinkable until two years ago. 
 
 The  , Aquarium at Pal, Botanical Garden at Ugat and the old historic fort have become the centres of attraction for people of the city after renovation. 
 
 Varsha Pandya, a young housewife from City Light, had young cousins visiting her. She didn’t know where to take them for an outing. Someone suggested her to take them to   Nature Park as it has 49 species of 385 animals there. She took three of her cousins in BRTS bus to Sarthana and spent a whole day there. Next day, she took them to marine Aquarium at Pal and on the third day they were off to Botanical Garden. The fourth day was spent at the newly-opened portion of old historic fort. 
 
  has provided citizens a number of facilities in the past few years to relax and enjoy. Of late, Surat is more than just eating out on footpaths and chowpaty. 
 
 “We are building recreational spots for youngsters so that they can enjoy during vacations. Like our mass transport system, the recreational facilities too have got people’s thumbs up,” SMC’s standing committee chairman   said.
