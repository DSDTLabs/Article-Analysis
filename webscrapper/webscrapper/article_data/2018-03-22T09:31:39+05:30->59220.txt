HYDERABAD: For three days, Qutbullapur MLA K P Vivekanand rode   buses plying from his constituency to the   via different routes and compiled a list of problems faced by passengers that he can take up with the concerned authorities to alleviate commuter woes.

 IT professionals he interacted with on the bus asked for an AC bus from Nizampet to   and women passengers demanded ladies only buses. “On all three days, women passengers said they wanted exclusive buses for ladies,” K P Vivekanand told TOI, adding that many passengers also complained about not enough buses plying during peak hours.
 
 The 40-year-old legislator said he understands the hardships that commuters face as he used to travel by an RTC bus every day during his college days (1997-2001), from Qutbullapur to Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology on Road No 3, Banjara  , and back. “Travelling in a bus is nothing new to me,” he said.
 
 “In the last three days, I saw there are many passengers who have to travel standing due to lack of seats. If more buses ply, passengers will be benefitted,” he said.
 
 On day one of his bus journey to the Assembly on March 19, Vivekanand travelled by an ordinary bus. On day two, he was joined by Serilingampally MLA A Gandhi and Kukatpally MLA M Krishna Rao. The three MLAs will now meet transport minister  , TSRTC chairman as well as managing director to resolve commuter problems.
