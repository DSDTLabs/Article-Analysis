Despite a series of modifications being made in the controversial film   including its renaming as  , the   on Friday again raised a demand for a complete ban on film.

 Speaking to media in Jaipur, Karni Sena observer   said that filmmaker   should forget dreaming about the film's release.
 
  
  
 All efforts of Bhansali and CBFC ( ) shall go down the drain as we will never allow the screening of Padmawati anywhere in India or abroad.
 
 "We are still adamant on our demand. Let there be a complete ban on the release of Padmawati," he added.
 
 Kalvi also demanded a complete ban on the 'Ghoomar' song. "We don't want any changes in the said song, however, we demand a complete ban on the same," he said.
 
 He also questioned the 'authenticity' of the panel formed by the CBFC to review the film.
 
 Not all of them were historians, hence, their suggestions hardly make a difference, he said, adding that the CBFC proposed to bring in nine historians in the panel but ended calling only three historians "which speaks volumes on their seriousness to justify our demands".
