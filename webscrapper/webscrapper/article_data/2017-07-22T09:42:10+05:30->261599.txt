AHMEDABAD: On June 24, 2015, a 25-feet crevasse opened up on the   underpass as the road caved in. That death trap gulped in a 40-year-old scooterist, Viraatben Vantani, who suffered a hit to the spine and sustained multiple fractures. Two years later, on Friday, the same spot began to cave in. More than Rs 15 crore of taxpayer money was pumped into repairing this horror hole - with the assurance that it will never endanger citizens again. 

 At the time, the civic body had announced that sewage lines had corroded over time, leading to frequent cave-ins on the stretch. Soon, the   (AMC) announced the replacement of 6km sewage lines between   and Pallav Crossroads. The work went on for 18 months as there were some hurdles near the Havmor stretch in Navrangpura. Fund allocation was also a problem. 
 
 Mahesh Kadia, 53, an auto-garage owner in Mithakhali gaam, said that cave-ins have become an annual problem in the area. "Two years ago, a girl had fallen inside a big crater in the road when she was riding," Kadia said. "We had tried our best to save her life but she had sustained multiple fractures. The road has become deadly again," Kadia alleged that the civic body comes up with only temporary solutions. 
 
 Prakash Jain, a chemist from the area, said that he has been observing the negligence of the civic body for 20 years. "The authorities have now stopped traffic movement on this road, but can it solve the problem?" he said. "It will increase the traffic snarls, in fact."
