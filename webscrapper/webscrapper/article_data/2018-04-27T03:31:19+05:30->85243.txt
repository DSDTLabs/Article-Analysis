GURUGRAM: The   of the   project, Valecha, has roped in   to give a report on why a concrete chunk on the flyover fell off this Monday. The report will be submitted to   in a day or two.

 
 According to sources, NHAI is yet to receive any report on the incident. The contractor has suggested IIT-Bombay inspect the stability of the structure.  , team leader of project consultant Indian Technocrat Limited, said, “IIT-Bombay will act as the proof consultant for the project. They will check everything and conduct necessary tests.”
 
 The safety audits for pedestrian and traffic movement on the flyover have been done by the contractor. Madhusudhan Rao, project manager of Valecha Engineer Limited, said, “We have already conducted our own tests. But if we get a proper report from a government institute (IIT-Bombay), it’s better. We hope to give the report to NHAI by Friday.” 
 
 Dr DD Sarode from the civil engineering department, IIT-Bombay, said, “It is evident that there was a lapse in quality measures during construction. Flyovers and bridges will undergo vibrations and this factor is always taken into consideration during construction. So, we cannot say vibrations caused the damage. But the damage is not a major one. In this case, the ‘defects liability period’ during which the company has the right to return to the site to remedy defects hasn’t expired. The damage was also repaired immediately. It seems the slab was damaged and it will not affect the structure of the flyover.”
