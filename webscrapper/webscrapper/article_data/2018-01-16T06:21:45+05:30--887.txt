RANCHI: A 45-year-old woman, Budhni  , of   under Tisri block of   district, allegedly died of starvation on Saturday. The district administration, however, said she died because of the cold wave sweeping the region.

 
 Soren is survived by her son, 7, and teen stepdaughter   Soren. Her second husband,  , died last year. Soren used to sell plates and bowls made of leaves to earn a living but was unable to go out to work the past few days because she was ill.
 
 Sunita said there had been nothing to eat at home for the last three days. "She was sick and could not go out to collect food," she said, adding they have no ration card or Aadhaar. "Neither the village head nor any other representative of the local administration ever came to us," Sunita said.
 
 
 Baleshwar Rai, head of Thansinghdih panchayat, said he received information about Soren but she died by the time he reached the village. Locals said the woman sometimes accompanied her son to school and ate a bit from his midday meal.
 
 
 The Giridih district administration ruled out starvation as being the cause of death.
