PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   ( ) will lay a 750 km-long optical fibre network, create 300 Wi-Fi hotspots, install   cameras at 600 locations, erect smart kiosks and complete other works under the   project, at an estimated cost of Rs 600 crore.

 An optical fibre network backbone will be created. Three ducts will be laid along the road, of which, one will be available to the contractor, free of cost, for one year. The other two ducts will belong to the PCMC. The civic body, in turn, will charge telecom operators and others interested in laying their cables through these ducts. After one year, the first duct too will be rented out. While the PCMC will generate revenues from the rent, the telecom companies will find it easier to use the ducts as they will not have the hassles of getting permissions and digging roads.
 
 Seema Savale, the chairperson of PCMC standing committee, said, “The civic body is laying an extensive network of water and drainage pipeline under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. We will lay the optical fibre ducts when the roads are dug up for water and drainage network, thereby saving on digging costs.”
 
 Touching upon another important topic,  , the ruling party leader, PCMC, said, “CCTV cameras will be installed at 600 locations to bring the entire city under surveillance.”
 
 In addition to all these, a Smart City mobile app will be developed for citizens.
