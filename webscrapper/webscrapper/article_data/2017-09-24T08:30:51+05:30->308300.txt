CHANDIGARH: A day after various farmer unions began a protest on the outskirts of Patiala, Punjab chief minister   Singh urged the leaders of these unions not to mislead farmers with false statements on the loan waiver issue.

 The chief minister said the loan waiver scheme would benefit 10.25 lakh farmers of the 13 lakh farming families and this constitute nearly 80% of the borrowers in the farming community. He said the loan waiver amount announced by his government was way above the amount announced by other states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Karnataka, despite the fact that Punjab was in a much worse financial condition.
 
 He said that it was hardly a matter of weeks now for the implementation process of the farm loan waiver scheme to begin. Amarinder appealed the farmers not to resort to extreme measures such as suicide out of desperation. He added that the newly-constituted committee headed by chairman mandi board   had started work on taking cognizance of the farmersâ€™ grievances on urgent basis.
