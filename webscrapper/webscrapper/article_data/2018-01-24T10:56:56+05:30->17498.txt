The ‘Bhaagamathie’ promotional video starring  , with music by SS Thaman released few hours ago, much to the delight of fans. 

  The promotional video features a peppy song with Anushka Shetty shaking a leg with few other ladies. The video also shows shots from behind-the-scenes of the film’s shoot, with director G Ashok calling the shots. A few crucial scenes that were showcased in the trailer are shown in the promotional video too. 
 
  But what caught the fans’ attention, much to their delight, is Prabhas’ cameo appearance! That’s right, some who have watched the 3 minute-long video might’ve missed it but at the 1:51 mark,   can be seen walking into the set in a checked shirt, with a handkerchief and sunglasses camouflaging his face, even if his hair and the build give him away. 
 
  The moment is truly one for the Prabhas-Anushka fan-base, with many commenting under the video, pointing out his presence. “whooooo did you see that at 1:51 our god..prabhas anna ” (sic) says a comment, while another asks if there are any ‘Pranushka’ fans there. Looks like the fan-base has already made up a name for them too, a la Virat and Anushka’s ‘Virushka’!
 
  Prabhas and Anushka have worked together in several films and are rumoured to have been dating since long. Once in every few months, both keep denying the rumours and reinstate the fact that they’re ‘just friends’ but the rumour mills just keep churning. Recently there was news that Prabhas’ uncle, Krishnam Raju, had said that the star will be married by the end of this year. And it’s only natural that many fans assume it will be Anushka, aka Sweety, whom he will be married to. However, Anushka confirmed (again) during a media interaction that they’re both just friends. 
 
  Is it a case of ‘the lady doth protest too much’ or if there’s genuinely nothing romantic between the two, only time can tell.
