LUCKNOW: Giving relief to hundreds of allottees of   on  , the high court on Monday stayed further demolition of the township's boundary wall and asked  , which had initiated demolition of the wall for an approach road to its own project, to first produce the actual map of the area in the next hearing. 

 More than 2,500 residents of the township had registered their protest against the LMC for forcefully demolishing the boundary wall for an approach road to its upcoming project ' ' in the vicinity. 
 
 Residents complained that LMC tried to demolish the wall thrice despite protests from the allottees and is now even constructing the main gate of its project in place of the wall.
 
 When LMC refused to withdraw, allottees approached the HC. In the same hearing on Monday, the court stayed further construction or demolition of the wall and asked both LMC as well as the township's builder to produce the actual map of the site to decide the case. 
 
 While LMC claimed that it had transferred some land to the builder earlier inside the township, in lieu of which he had given LMC the stretch nearby and also signed an agreement to give LMC an approach road through the township, residents argued that there was no mention of such an agreement while selling the flats. "The builder had promised to give us a gated township with walls all around. Encroachment by LMC's township will compromise our security", said Manoj Kumar Jha, president of the RWA.
