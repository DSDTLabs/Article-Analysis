AHMEDABAD: Congress MLA   and his supporters were arrested after they held a protest on the streets of Amreli wearing helmets. Dhanani said that they were protesting as Prime Minister   had failed to fulfill the promises made in the past.

 The Congress workers led by Dhanani led a protest march from the District Panchayat office in Amreli and marched upto Rajkamal chowk where they were detained. The Workers holding banners against Modi raised slogans against Modi.
 
 Dhanani said that “The situation in Amreli is really bad, there old irrigation schemes which are yet not completed, there is lack of government engineering college in the district. The famers are committing suicide as they are not getting adequate price for their crop and even the amount of the crop insurance is not being paid to them.”
 
 “When Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat he had promised Rs 700 crore for the development of Amreli, but the amount has still not been received,” he said.
 
 The Workers sat on a dharna at the Rajkamal chowk in Amreli where the police detained them and took them to the headquarters. The Police even detained some of the women workers who were protesting at the venue. Interestingly, a couple of two wheeler drivers who stood by to watch the protest with their helmets were also detained. They were seen telling that they were not congress workers but the police refusing to hear anything detained them.
