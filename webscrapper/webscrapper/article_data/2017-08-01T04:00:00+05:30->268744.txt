Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding that candidates contesting polls be made to submit proof to substantiate details they furnish in nomination papers.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice RS Reddy dismissed the PIL on the grounds that provisions already exist in the Representation of the People Act for taking action against a candidate for furnishing false information, and hence there was no need to issue direction to authorities in this regard.
 
 The petitioner, advocate K R Koshti, had filed the PIL earlier this year. He had cited a couple of instances in which information provided by candidates was proved wrong. The court observed: “From the provisions contained in section 125A of the Representation of the People Act, it is clear that if the candidate fails to furnish information required under the Act or gives false information, which he knows or has reason to believe to be false or conceals any information in his nomination paper or in his affidavit, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or both.”
 
 The HC observed that on the basis of directions issued by the Supreme Court, necessary amendment is made to the law for submitting an affidavit at the time of filing the nomination form. “In the absence of any specific provisions in the Act or the rules for providing supporting documents in support of the averments made in the affidavit, directions asked for by the petitioner cannot be issued,” the HC order reads. The HC also junked the PIL on the grounds that the Delhi MLA the petitioner mentioned had to resign after his degree was found to be fake.
