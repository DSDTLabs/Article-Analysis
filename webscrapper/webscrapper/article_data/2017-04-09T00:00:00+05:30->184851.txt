Scents need to change depending on the season. Go for fresher and lighter scents now. 

 
 Sun rays not only mess up your skin, but also increase your chances of getting skin cancer. Put on some sunscreen. 
 
 
  Winter moisturisers are heavy and greasy. Using the same moisturisers for   will make your skin oily and cause it to break out. Switch to a light lotion. 
 
 
  Dry or calloused skin, sadly, is not just a winter problem. Give yourself a clean start this season by using an exfoliating face wash. 
 
 
  Ignore getting frequent cuts and you’ll end up looking unkempt.
  
 
  The humidity in the air makes your   frizzy and wild. Look out for shampoos which are light and ‘clarifying’ to remove deposits and get a sheen. 
 
 
  Don’t overload your mane with hairstyling products. Use as little product as possible. Go for hairstyling sprays, matte-based pomades and hair mousse.
