BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh police department is taking steps to improve the health and fitness of its police officers.

 This comes days after Neemuch cop   was fat shamed on twitter. The incident has inspired the state police department to keep a track of its fitness levels.
 
 Dinesh Chand Sagar, IGP Planning has taken the initiative to motivate the police officers to work out at a gym every day.
 
 On Thursday, Sagar gave a counselling session to the police officers to begin the ‘health gain drive’. After the session, many policemen were seen trying out the different machines at the gym — treadmill, cross trainer, weights among others.
 
 There is a gym in the police headquarters that was started one year ago, but there are only around 10 policemen who visit it regularly.
 
 Sumer Raghuwanshi, posted in police headquarters, had his first day at a gym after the counselling session. ‘I have never worked out at a gym before. But I will try and exercise every day from now,’ said Raghuwanshi.
 
 “The idea is to motivate people to be conscious of their health. Everyone should incorporate some exercise into their daily routine. I will personally see to it that maximum people start gymming after Holi is over and we will have regular counselling sessions. A good workout with a proper diet rich in protein, vitamins and other nutrients is necessary for overall fitness and strength,” said  .
 
 Raman Singh Sikarwar, DIG, when asked about the steps taken towards fitness of the police personnel said, “There are several police gyms in Bhopal which are open for every officer. It is often noticed that when police officers are on a field posting, they are usually fit, it is when they get supervisory work is when they start ignoring their health, which should be monitored regularly. Time should be dedicated towards maintaining one’s health.”
