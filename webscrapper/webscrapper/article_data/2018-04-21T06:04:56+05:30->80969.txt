KOLKATA: The West Bengal Medical Council ( ) on Friday completed drafting the chargesheet against three doctors in the   medical negligence case. Copies of the chargesheet have been sent to the doctors. The fourmonth-old had died in Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on April 19 last year, hours after she underwent a colonoscopy procedure.

 “The council has issued chargesheet to three doctors — paediatric surgeon  , anesthesiologist   and gastroenterologist Subhash Tiwary — who were involved in the treatment. The official communication is being sent to the concerned doctors,” said  , WBMC registrar.
 
 The council decided not to chargesheet Dr Mahesh Goenka after not finding substantial evidence against him. The child’s parents, however, had accused all the four doctors of medical negligence. The three doctors are likely to appear before the council next Thursday.
 
 Last year in June, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission had held the hospital responsible for deficiency in service and negligence and ordered it to pay a compensation of Rs 30 lakh to   and Shalu, the child’s parents. The commission then forwarded the case to the council to probe medical negligence.
 
 “The decision to issue charge sheet was taken after finding merit in the case. Now, the chargesheeted doctors will get a chance to defend themselves. This is a part of the procedure before the council gives verdict,” said a council insider.
