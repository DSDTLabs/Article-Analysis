AHMEDABAD: The dust is yet to settle on a murder and   at   of north Gujarat with activists continuing to throng the   every alternate day to demand justice. 

 On the other hand, the villagers and an organisation working to  , have begun preparations for wedding revelry with 27 weddings set for May 21 in the violence-torn village. Only 12 brides and grooms are from Vadavali, with the other couples being from nearby villages. Many families from nearby villages agreed to participate in the event after the mass wedding was planned.
 
 In a manner reminiscent of the 2002 riots, the mass wedding programme took shape in a relief camp, where Muslims of the village had shifted following the communal rioting of the last week of March. In 2002 too, mass weddings had taken place at various relief camps in Ahmedabad and other places.
 
 It was the   that mooted the proposal to organize a mass wedding in the village. On why such weddings are planned such a short while after the rioting with the families yet to return to their homes, the Jamiat's Mufti Abdul Kayyum Mansuri said, "We planned this event after Ramzan Eid, but the villagers insisted that it take place before the monsoon and Ramzan. We plan to spend nearly Rs 50,000 on each couple's wedding."
 
 One of the organizers, Mehboobshah Diwan, said that there are five families whose houses were torched and damaged in the riots, and they are also participating in the event. "Samul lagna (mass marriage) is organized mainly to curb the extra expenditure incurred in weddings," he said.
 
 The family of Ibrahimkhan Behlim, who was killed during the communal violence, is not participating in the event.
 
 Local secretary of Jamiat, Salim Rangrez said that when a survey of the damage was being conducted, they learned that weddings were planned for this summer by 18 families. Social activists, however, are miffed at the development.
