GURUGRAM: The city will get six additional   treatments plants under a central mission that is likely to ease the load of the municipal corporation in handling waste. 

 Officials said the six plants will come up in locations where the   master line was either unavailable or insufficient. Tenders were floated on January 19 and the project is estimated at Rs 19 crore. The project is being implemented under the Atal Mission for   and Urban Transmission.
 
 “The project has been in the pipeline for over a year, but since it is being implemented under a central scheme, it took us some time to get the approvals. We have floated tenders and are hopeful the plants should be functional by March,” said  , an executive engineer at the Gurugram municipal corporation.
 
 The plants, which will have a capacity of 30-50mld, will come up in Gadoli, Gawal Pahari, Gadoli Khurd, Sikanderpur and Dhankot. Officials said the existing pipelines weren’t sufficient to bear the load of the expanding city and would overflow at times.
 
 “The problem is that with time, the load has increased but the pipelines haven’t been upgraded in many areas. Illegal constructions have added to the load,” said a corporation official.
 
 In old Gurugram, there have been several instances of drainage water overflowing onto the roads and seeping into drinking water pipelines at times.
 
 Several councillors have highlighted the issue and have also demanded that the corporation should have at least one sewer sucking machine in every zone in addition to the two it has for the entire city.
