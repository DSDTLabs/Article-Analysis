NEW DELHI:   on Saturday has decided not to hold online entrance tests for PG, MPhil and PhD programmes. Instead, it would conduct offline tests in six cities.

 The decision was taken fearing logistical troubles and under pressure from DU Students’ Union and ABVP, who have been demanding more offline centres. However, admissions to the nine professional UG courses would be based on online tests across 18 pre-decided cities.
 
 On May 19, 2017, DU had decided to conduct online tests on May 31 and have an offline centre in Delhi.
 
 The university felt that it would not be able to cope with the logistical requirements for the dual mode of tests on such a short notice. “The dual mode of tests would require double  . We have decided to hold online tests for UG professional courses on a pilot basis,” said Maharaja K Pandit, chairperson of admission committee, DU.
 
 However, there was no unanimity on the issue as some members of the standing committee said the matter should have been referred to the academic council.
 
 The offline tests for postgraduate and research programmes would be conducted in Guwahati, Kolkata, Varanasi, Nagpur and Chennai/ Bengaluru. The final decision on either Chennai or Bengaluru would be taken based on the availability of centres.
 
 The online tests for undergraduate courses would be conducted in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jammu, Mumbai, Nagpur, Patna, Ranchi, Trivandrum and Varanasi.
 
 Among other decisions taken at the meeting was a uniform 1% point concession to women candidates in the cutoff.
 
 The standing committee also decided that while the minority colleges can register candidates on their portal, it is mandatory for the candidates to enter their preference in the Delhi University registration form.
