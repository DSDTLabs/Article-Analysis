KOLKATA:   will hope to return to winning ways when they face the challenge of   in their seventh-round   encounter at the   ground on Tuesday evening.

 Having drawn their last three home matches --- against  ,   and   --- the green and maroons are under pressure as they stand fourth in the table with 10 points after six matches.
 
 They will, thus, be quite desperate to pick up full points against Chennai City FC in order not to fall too behind in the title race.
 
 Mohun Bagan will continue to miss the services of Haitian playmaker and captain Sony Norde and right-back Arijit Bagui owing to injuries. That means Mohun Bagan will have three foreign players at their disposal: defender Eze Kingsley, attacking midfielder Ansumana Kromah and striker Aser Pierrick Dipanda Dicka.
 
 “We have to get back to scoring goals. The path would not always be smooth but you need to find a way out. We have ourselves created this pressure and we only need to come out of it,” said Mohun Bagan coach Sanjoy Sen at the pre-match press conference on Monday. “I felt in the last match against Indian Arrows, we took a lot of pressure after conceding the equaliser. The boys should not take much pressure.”
 
 There might be two changes to Mohun Bagan’s starting XI from the game against Indian Arrows. Central defender Rana Gharami might come in place of Kingshuk Debnath while Surchandra Singh may replace Raynier Fernandes in central midfield.
 
 On the other hand, Chennai City FC are in the eighth spot on the table with four points from six encounters. They lost their last match 1-2 at home against East Bengal.
 
 “It is a great challenge to play Mohun Bagan at their home ground. We have been playing well but not getting the desired result,” said Chennai City FC coach V Soundararajan.
