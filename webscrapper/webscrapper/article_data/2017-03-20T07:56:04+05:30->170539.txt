  : The department of critical care medicine of the multi-speciality   and Hospital (KMCH) conducted a one day outreach programme aimed at educating paramedical staff working in intensive care units (ICU) in the district on Saturday. 

 Medical experts conducted six lectures and four workshops at   in Salem. About 150 critical care nurses, technicians and paramedical staff from various hospitals benefited from the programme.
 
 The hospital has been conducting the programme for the last 12 years, Dr P   of KMCH said. "The main objective of the programme is to train critical care nurses and paramedics in the latest developments in critical care. They underwent training in trauma care, basic and advanced cardiac life support, hemodynamic monitoring, mechanical ventilator care, treating poison cases, infection control in ICUs and transport of critically-ill patients." 
 
 "We started focussing on small towns from last year and conducted similar programmes in Karur and Erode districts. Over 150 staff from various hospitals attended the event. Critical care nurses, emergency nurses and respiratory therapists form the first contact in management of critically-ill patients. They also play a significant role in day-to-day care," he added.
 
 The programme was inaugurated by the president of IMA MK Selvakkalanjiyam and secretary P Saralabai. Dr T Gopinathan and Dr S   from the department of critical care medicine conducted the classes.
