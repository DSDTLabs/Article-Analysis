Hyderabad girl,   who starred in recently released youthful entertainers 'Kerintha' and 'Nandini Nursing Home', is set to test the waters in Mollywood. The half-MalayaIi girl is probably one of the very few girls who made a name for herself in Telugu before going to the Malayalam industry. 

 Till today, we have numerous actresses from Malayalam industry ruling the roost in Tollywood. For a change, it seems that the actress is making her way to earn popularity with an advantage of being born to a Malayali mother.
 
 The makers of a hooror-thriller titled 'E' have reportedly signed in the actress to play the female lead of their movie, under the direction of Kukku Surendran. 
 
 Let us wait and see how the actress gets to reap the best out of both the industries.
