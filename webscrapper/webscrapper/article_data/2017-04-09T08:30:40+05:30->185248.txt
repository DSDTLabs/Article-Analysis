DHARAMSHALA: The   Cricket Association (HPCA) stadium hosted a different game on Saturday as top   leaders and their supporters were seen huddled inside the premises to discuss there strategy for the forthcoming Assembly elections. What made the even more interesting was presence of Union health minister JP Nadda, with his supporters almost declaring arrival of a new leadership in the state party unit. 

 Assembly elections are due in the state by year-end and there are already speculations regarding BJP’s chief ministerial candidate. While BJP in Himachal in the past saw two power centres, one led by P K Dhumal and the other by Shanta Kumar, consolidation of Nadda in national politics has added another dimension to political equations within BJP in Himachal. While no public statement was made regarding the meet, former chief minister P K Dhumal and JP Nadda held a closed-door meeting over lunch to discuss party affairs. 
 
 Member of Parliament Anurag Thakur, acted as host for the summit but did not participate in the meeting held by the two leaders. All other party leaders and close aides of even Shanta Kumar (sitting MP from Kangra) from across the region gathered at the Kangra airport to welcome the Union health minister. Shanta Kumar was also expected to attend the program but could not make it. His office sited his busy schedule for skipping the programme. 
 
 Rakesh Pathania, former associate member of BJP, former ministers Kishan Kapoor and Ramesh Dhawala, Ex MLAs Parveen Sharma, Sanjay Choudhary, Vipan Parmar and Dullo Ram accompanied Nadda to the cricket stadium. “We are here only because of our leader (JP Nadda) otherwise we maintain distance from HPCA,” said a BJP leader requesting anonymity.
 
 Sources in BJP said that party workers and leaders who were sidelined by the Dhumal clan were now trying to project a new face of the party in Himachal Pradesh.
