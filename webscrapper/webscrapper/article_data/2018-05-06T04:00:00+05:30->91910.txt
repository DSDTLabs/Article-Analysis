Vadodara: Even as the race heats up for the next mayor of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), eyes are set on the ward 11 seat that has been lying vacant since the last four months after the death of former deputy mayor Mamta Kale. It is a general category seat for a woman candidate and so is the mayor’s post that falls vacant in June. Sources in the civic body said that the two-and-a-half-year term of the mayor will expire in June. The next mayor of the city will be elected by the general board of the civic body in the same month. As per the rules, a general board meeting of the civic body must be held before the twentieth of every month. It is expected that the election of the mayor will be made in such a meeting before June 20. Hectic lobbying has already started for the mayor’s post. It is not only the women corporators who are lobbying, but even heavyweights of the ruling BJP have thrown their hats into the arena to ensure that their confidante is picked up for the post. Many believe that barring standing committee chairperson Dr Jigisha Sheth, the contest is amongst equals. The vacant ward 11 seat has, however, added an interesting dimension to the situation. Kale had passed away in January and polls for the seat have to be conducted before six months that expire in the month of July. The preparation of polls, however, is yet to begin. Sources said that if the BJP considers a person who is not a corporator for the mayor’s post, it may make the person contest on the vacant ward 11 seat and see that she is elected. This has also led to hectic politicking for the ward 11 seat with senior members pitching names from their own lobbies for the ticket.
