AHMEDABAD: A 39-year-old homoeopathic doctor hanged herself at her parents’ residence in Vastrapur on April 29. Her family members have accused her estranged husband and in-laws of abetment to suicide, in a complaint filed with Vastrapur police. The family alleges that the accused were demanding Rs 10 lakh as dowry.

 According to Vastrapur police, Dr Mounvi Shah was found dead in her bedroom at Chitrakut Bungalow. She had left a note describing the frustration with her marriage and the strained relationship with her husband and in-laws. “Her mother,  , 64, has mentioned in her complaint that Mounvi married Niraj Shah, a resident of   near   in Vasna, in January 2007,” said a Vastrapur police official. “Niraj and family members soon allegedly demanded Rs 10 lakh as he was aspiring to migrate to Canada.”
 
 In February, Mounvi told her mother that even after their honeymoon in Shimla, their marriage had not been consummated. She also complained of Niraj’s rude behaviour and the harassment from Niraj’s father, mother, and sister. “Between August 2007 and April 2011, she was sent back and forth from her in-laws’ house,” said the official. “When a reconciliation attempt failed in April 2011, Mounvi started living at her parents’ house. Niraj and his family would allegedly take her home only when there was a social event.”
 
 The last straw was the death of Mounvi’s father in January this year. Nobody from Niraj’s family turned up for the last rites. In February, there was another round of talks but Niraj’s family insisted that divorce was the only way out. Soon afterwards, the family received a notice from the family court following Niraj’s application. “The complaint mentions that Mounvi tried to save her marriage and thus did not lodge a complaint,” said the official. “The investigation has started on the basis of the note found from her room.”
