AMARAVATI : The political scene in   got hotter on Sunday when BJP announced   has been appointed as the president of the state unit of the party. A powerful Kappu leader from Guntur, Kanna was in dramatic fashion lured back by BJP days after he quit it and announced his decision to join YSR Congress.

 
 A minister in the Congress government and five-term MLA, Kanna joined BJP soon after the Congress rout in 2014. According to sources, the BJP central dealership was in direct touch with Kanna. Lokesh from TDP and YV Subba Reddy from YSR Congress were in touch with him. But, at the last moment, he decided to stay on in BJP. Kanna’s appointment has led to deep resentment among some BJP leaders, particularly Veerraju’s group.
