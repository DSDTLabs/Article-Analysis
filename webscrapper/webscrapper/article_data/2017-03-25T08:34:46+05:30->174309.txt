LUCKNOW: Despite being curable, tuberculosis (TB) is still leading to deaths in India. While lack of awareness allowed the infection to catch people unaware,   was also to be blamed, said   expert Prof  . 

 Addressing faculty and doctors from the city at Sanjay Gandhi   here on the occasion of World TB Awareness Day, Dr Prasad said, “About 50% of the doctors are not able to diagnose TB correctly. The problem needs to be corrected to arrest conversion of general TB cases into drug resistant ones.”
 
 To note, India has pledged to eradicate TB by 2025. On this, Dr Prasad said, “India cannot think about achieving the target till the issue of wrong diagnosis is addressed.” TB awareness programmes were also organized by various city hospitals including King George’s Medical University. 
 
 Head of pulmonary medicine department, Prof Surya Kant said that malnutrition in the society provided a base to the opportunist TB bacterium. “Many people skip their breakfast which lowers the body’s immunity and makes them vulnerable to infections including TB,” he said, adding that those working in the health sector must work to build and maintain their resistance power.
