Lucknow: In an attempt to motivate people to exercise their universal adult franchise in the upcoming state elections, the district administration has started sending official letters with stamped reminders telling officials about their right to vote. 

 Lucknow goes to polls on February 19, which is a Sunday. Additional district magistrate (finance & revenue) Nidhi Srivastava said, in compliance with the directives of the Election Commission of India, the district administration had initiated a number of steps to increase voter awareness in the city. “Stamping a message on every official envelope sent by the district administration is a novel way to remind people to cast their votes,” Srivastava said.
