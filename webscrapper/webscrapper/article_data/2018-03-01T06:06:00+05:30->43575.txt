KOLKATA: CBI has registered an FIR against RP Infosystems for defrauding a consortium of 10 banks, which includes Punjab National Bank, of Rs 515 crore. This is the first bank fraud case registered in the city after the   Modi-PNB scam broke out. 

 The consortium alleged the city-based company, along with its four directors, for the fraud committed by availing bank funds on the basis of false and fabricated stock/debtor statements and forged drawing-power letters. Other than  , the consortium includes SBI, Canara Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce,  , Allahabad Bank and  , among others. 
 
 Central Bank has a Rs 82-crore exposure, while Canara Bank has Rs 81 crore and PNB Rs 73 crore. After Canara Bank registered a formal complaint on February 26 against RP Infosystems, which manufactures and trades in desktops and laptops across India under brand name ‘Chirag’, CBI sleuths raided several places in Kolkata, Howrah and North 24 Parganas. 
 
 Even its office at BBD Bag in central Kolkata was raided. Among those named in the preliminary FIR are the company’s four directors, including Shivaji Panja, Kaustav Roy and Vinay Bafna. When contacted, both Panja and Roy said: “We have cooperated with the CBI earlier and will cooperate with them this time too.” 
 
 The FIR also alleges that Letters of Credit (LCs) opened by various consortium members on the applications of the company started devolving from 2012 due to non-maintenance of funds. The company also inflated its receivables.
