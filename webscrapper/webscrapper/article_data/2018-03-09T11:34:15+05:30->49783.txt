BHUBANESWAR: Dissent has surfaced within BJD over its decision to nominate media baron   and educationist   to the  . The discontent has prompted the party spokespersons and other senior leaders to defend chief minister  's choices.

 BJD leader and former chairperson of the state women's commission,  , who was also an aspirant for an Upper House berth, openly expressed her resentment at being 'overlooked'.
 
 "Injustice has been done by not nominating a single woman to the Rajya Sabha. There are two crore women in the state. Don't they have the eligibility to represent the state in the Rajya Sabha? I was informed that my name was on the short-list but, today. I am a disappointed woman," she said.
 
 She also expressed displeasure over leaders from western Odisha being 'ignored' for the Rajya Sabha. "All three members of the Upper House from the state - Dilip Tirkey, A U Singhdeo and A V Swamy - whose tenures will end in April, hail from that part of the state. So at least one leader from the region should have been nominated," she added.
 
 Munna Khan, another Rajya Sabha aspirant, said BJD would have done better to nominate him to the Upper House as it would have satisfied members of the minority community to which he belongs. "Since chief minister Naveen Patnaik has already taken his decision, it would not be proper to comment further," he added.
 
 Defending the chief minister's decision, textiles and handloom minister Snehangini Chhuria said, "Naveen babu must have considered all aspects before making his choices."
