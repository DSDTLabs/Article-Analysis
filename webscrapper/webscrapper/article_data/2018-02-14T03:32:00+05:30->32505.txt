Nagpur: The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has been unable to find even a single buyer for flats constructed for higher income group (HIG) at Gorepeth and Bhamti. The sale of Gorepeth flats had been put off since last four years due to a land dispute. A NIT official told TOI the tendering process and open auction was held for HIG flats last month, but no one turned up. “We are again planning to go in for an auction soon,” he said. In 2011, NMC had started construction of HIG flat scheme with 15 flats each of 2BHK and 3BHK adjacent to the canal at Gorepeth. Deadline to complete the scheme was set as December 2012. NIT completed the construction of nine flats — six 3BHK and three 2BHK — in 2014. The project was stuck due to land dispute with the family of IAS officer Atul Patne. NIT was planning to complete the entire scheme and then auction the flats. However, the land dispute stretched on, and remains unresolved even now. NIT recently tried to auction the nine completed flats, keeping on hold the remaining flats. Known for its planning, NIT had constructed 3BHK with super built up area of 1,396 sq ft (129.79 sq m) and kept offset price of Rs1,02,14,080, which comes to 7,316.67 per sq ft. Super built area of 2BHK was 1,053.94 sq ft (97.95 sq m) and offset price was Rs80.40 lakh, which comes to Rs7,628.51 per sq ft. Similarly, NIT had constructed 200 flats of 1BHK, 2BHK and 3BHK at Bhamti along London Street. NIT started auction of the flats in January 2014. NIT got good response for 1BHK and 2BHK flats at that time while only 30 of total 70 3BHK flats were sold. Auction for remaining 40 flats was done along with the flats at Gorepeth scheme recently. The built up area of the 3BHK flats is 956.77 sq ft and offset price is Rs53.35 lakh. NIT officials said there are some reasons behind the setback in sale of HIG flats. “Purchaser has to pay ground rent of 2% of total value of flat to NIT every year. Ground rent becomes high when it comes to 3BHK flats. Flat owner would have to pay NIT’s ground rent, and also NMC’s property tax every year. Also, there seems to be not much demand for flats in the present condition. Another reason could be there is less demand for 3BHK flats or those costing above Rs40 lakh,” he said.
