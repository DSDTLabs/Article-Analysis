Rajkot: The anganwadi and Asha workers on Thursday continued their protest against the state government demanding pay hike despite local administration threatening to cut their wages. 

 Over 30 anganwadi and Asha workers have been sitting on a protest outside the Rajkot district collector’s office since Wednesday. The woman workers have gone on a hunger strike to press for their demands.
 
 However, on Thursday, health of five protesting anganwadi workers deteriorated and were shifted to civil hospital in Rajkot for treatment.
 
 Those who were hospitalized were identified as Rajeshwari Dave, Chhaya Solanki, Bhavna Jadav, Vanita Chavda and Meghna Khambhaliya.
 
 Sources said that Dave’s condition was critical and she was shifted to a private hospital in Rajkot later in the day.
 
 Rajkot municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani warned agitating women workers to resume the work or their wages would be cut.
 
 Anganwadi and Asha workers from across the state have been protesting in their respective districts for wage hikes.
