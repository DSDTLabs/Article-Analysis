PATNA: The woman (30) who accused a top   for Population Activities ( ) official of sexual harassment and character assassination during her association with the UN body said on Saturday she feared threat to her life.

 Addressing a press conference here, she also accused the Pataliputra police station SHO of not taking up her FIR properly and sought security. The woman also said she was not provided a copy of the FIR she had lodged on February 21. “I visited the police station today but the SHO was not present. He talked to me over the phone and asked some very personal questions unrelated to the case,” the woman said, adding she would write to the DGP to transfer her case to another police station.
 
 The woman was associated with UNFPA for gender alliance programme in Bihar through an NGO. Working as state manager for the programme, she and her team had developed mobile-based ‘Bandhan Tod’ app for rescuing children from child marriages and creating awareness against dowry atrocities. “Since I mentioned the NGO’s name for the first time in the press meet today, I fear for my safety,” she said.
 
 She had earlier written a complaint letter to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on February 2, requesting her to waive off the diplomatic immunity to the UNFPA official.
 
 When contacted, rural SP and officiating Patna SSP   said he would consider providing security to her only after receiving a request letter for that. On the alleged hostile behaviour of Pataliputra police station SHO, Prasad said he had no knowledge about it. 
 
 Patna zonal IG   said the woman’s case would be taken up as per the standard operating procedure (SOP). “An FIR has been registered and further action shall be taken as per law,” Khan replied to a text message to this reporter.
 
 Meanwhile, students from various schools and colleges have planned a march in her support at Kargil Chowk on Sunday.
