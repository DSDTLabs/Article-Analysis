MUMBAI: The state government pulled down 11 websites after receiving complaints from the entertainment industry that they had uploaded pirated content.

 The   Cyber Digital Crime Unit (MCDCU), started last August for systematically eliminating websites that upload pirated content, pulled down these websites.
 
 Brijesh Singh, special inspector general of police, Maharashtra cyber cell, said the collective viewership of these websites was over 80 million.
 
 The initiative, the first of its kind in the country, was launched by the Cyber Cell of Maharashtra police following directions from the Home Department. Laxman Kamble, the lone police inspector attached to the state government's cyber cell, said in a bid to contain piracy, a multi-stakeholder model was created on a pilot basis. Industry stakeholders and officers of the Cyber Cell are members.
 
 Kamble said the pilot project was started after CM   received complaints from media conglomerates   and Star. He said that based on London metropolitan police’s ‘IPCO’ unit around 9,000 websites, under lens for piracy, were studied and 19 parameters applied to shortlist these portals. Action was sought under Section 149 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure. AGENCIES
