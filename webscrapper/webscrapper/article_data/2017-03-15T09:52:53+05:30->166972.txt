Actress 
  has been showered with praises for her feisty performance as a madam of a brothel, in the trailer of her upcoming film ‘Begum Jaan’. The actress along with the film’s director   and producer were recently spotted at the Kolkata airport, going about their professional commitments, when a male fan approached the star for a selfie. Being the fan-friendly celebrity she is, Vidya reportedly obliged the fan's request and agreed to pose with him, however, things took an ugly turn when he got too close for comfort. 

 According to online reports, the male fan put his arm around Vidya without even asking for her consent. Feeling uncomfortable with the overly friendly gesture, Vidya allegedly warned the fan not to do that and the same was also conveyed by her manager. However, during a second attempt at clicking a picture, the man once again put his arm around her to which Vidya hit back asking him what he was doing saying “this is wrong”.
 
 Pointing out that he couldn’t behave himself, Vidya refused to take a picture and walked off. 
 
 Speaking about the same to an online portal, the star explained that one tends to get uncomfortable when a man or woman intrudes into one’s personal space. According to the report, the Vidya admitted that she is a ‘public figure’, but also pointed out that she is “not public property”.
