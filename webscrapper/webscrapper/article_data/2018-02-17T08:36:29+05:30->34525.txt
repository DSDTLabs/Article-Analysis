PUNE: Most aspirants who will take the   (PUP) Scholarship and the   (PSS) examinations on Sunday will be from the district. However, the overall number of examinees has dropped by nearly one lakh.

 The   (MSCE) chairman Dattatray Jagtap admitted that the low scholarship amount — Rs 100 per month — even lower in rural and other categories, is turning aspirants away. Jagtap addressed a news conference on Friday.
 
 “Some students take the exam because it is a prestigious scholarship. But poor students need a meaningful sum to continue their studies. The scholarship amount must be increased as the current structure has been around for a long time. This can be why the total number of applicants has fallen by nearly 95,000 over the past year,” he added.
 
 The MSCE sent two proposals to the state government in August and September 2017 to increase the scholarship amount, and to remove the rural-urban divide.
 
 “ For PUP, we proposed an amount of Rs 500 per month, and Rs 750 for PSS. We had also proposed removal of categories that would reduce the scholarship amount in rural and tribal areas,” he said.
 
 “Many students go to ICSE, ISC, and CBSE-affiliated institutions. Fewer students apply for PSS due to the National Merit-cum-Means Scholarship,” MSCE commissioner Sukhdev Dere said. A student should secure at least 60 marks or 40% for the scholarship.
