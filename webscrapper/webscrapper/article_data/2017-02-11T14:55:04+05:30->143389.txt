 The actress, along with Ewan Gunn, Brand Ambassador,  , was speaking at an event to celebrate International Scotch Day. 
 
 "I do love drinking with my dad but the person I enjoy with more is my sister. Because we get into these talks about whose Scotch is better. She naturally veers towards something which is more smoky, while I prefer the sweeter, mellow flavour."
