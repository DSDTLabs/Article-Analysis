CHENNAI: Stop treating unequals as equals and stop mindless application of service rules while preparing   list of technical persons in police department, the   told the state government.

 The issue pertains to the practice of deciding the seniority list of police personnel working in the   of the department, based on the marks obtained in the general training provided in police training college, without due weightage to marks obtained in special technical training exclusively provided to technical personnel.
 
 P K  , a sub inspector (technical), attached to police telecommunication branch,   approached the court to quash a recent seniority list and direct the department to refix seniority based on marks obtained in technical training.
 
 Allowing the petition,   said: “The rules are very clear that due emphasis was placed on the technical knowledge of the personnel to be recruited as sub inspectors (technical). Elaborate training has also been provided on the technical side for the purpose of handling their jobs. Such technical posts are not interchangeable and the personnel have to remain on technical side till retirement. They are not vested with the normal power of even registration of FIRs.”
 
 Such being the case, it is rather preposterous that the administration has given undue weightage only to the proficiency of such technical personnel in general training, completely wishing away their proficiency in the technical training, he added.
 
 He then quashed the seniority list dated February 13, 2007 and directed the department to recast the seniority based on technical expertise.
