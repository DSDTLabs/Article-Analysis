KOCHI: The much-delayed   of the   (Cusat) will be ready by end of the month. Though the authorities had plans to get the pond ready by last monsoon, it could not be completed. 

 "We have kept a deadline of March 1 for inauguration and are working towards it. The construction of the rubble wall is on," said P Sathi, Cusat's engineer in-charge.
 
 She said that they had initially pumped water into the pond but now the water level is getting  . "Once the construction is over we expect natural water recharge to be fast," she added.
 
 The pond had faced hurdles right after the construction began in 2014. The work was held up after the contractor found rocks and boulders at around 5-7m depth. It was after a technical assessment by the state groundwater department that the work was restarted last year.
 
 The semi-dug pond was filled with water during the rains in 2014 and it took more than a drought year to dry out the water indicating that the university could tide over its water shortage if its taps this potential source.
 
 A rubble wall is being constructed around the pond. Being built at a cost of Rs 1.50 crore, the pond adjacent to the   has the capacity to hold at least 30 lakh litres of rainwater.
 
 "We hope that this will help us address the water problem in the hostels and residential quarters at least partly. While the full capacity will be seen only in the rainfall months, there is adequate water now. We had to pump out the water frequently while the construction work was going on because of fast natural recharge," an official said.
