HYDERABAD: As he forges ahead on his Federal Front plans, TRS president and chief minister   will play host to former Uttar Pradesh CM and Samajwadi Party (SP) president   at Pragathi Bhavan here on Wednesday. 

 Senior TRS sources said   will explain the "mission" he has taken up to foray into national politics during his meeting with Akhilesh, who will be accorded a grand welcome at Begumpet airport after making a touchdown. He is set to take a chartered flight. 
 
 The ruling TRS has planned a rousing reception led by animal husbandry minister T Srinivas Yadav. Apart from the minister, members of the Yadav community, public representatives and other leaders will be at hand to receive   at the airport. KCR's son and IT minister KT Rama Rao had stopped by in Lucknow last week to meet Akhilesh and invite him to Hyderabad. 
 
 Sources said Akhilesh is an important cog in the political wheel for KCR to work out a formidable anti-BJP and anti-Congress alternative before the 2019 elections. UP with 80 Lok Sabha seats holds the key to formation of the government at the Centre. The ground reality is that SP had secured only five LS seats in 2014, while BJP won 73 seats. SP also lost last year's assembly polls. 
 
 But what came as a clincher was the coming together of SP and Mayawati's BSP in Gorakhpur bypoll earlier this year, won by an SP candidate. The seat had fallen vacant after incumbent MP Yogi Adiyanath became CM of UP. According to an analysis, if SP and BSP were to contest the Lok Sabha polls together, the combine will be able to win 50 seats based on the number of votes they had secured in the assembly polls last year. This is a calculation that has not been lost on KCR, sources said. 
 
 His confidence is that if several parties join to keep BJP and the Congress at bay, the alternative force - the Federal Front as he refers to it - will have enough arsenal to form the government at the Centre.
