BHOPAL: The   (MoHFW) has sought service extension of Dr  , head of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Raipur. Dr Nagarkar is also the additional director  ,   since June 2015. 

 Amid speculations of a new director joining AIIMS, Bhopal, the Union health ministry has requested the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, which is the parent department of Dr Nagarkar, to retain him for four more months or till the time extension is granted by the Union government's Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC). This was confirmed by Santosh Sohgaura, the deputy director (administration) of AIIMS, Bhopal.
 
 Recently, Bhopal MP and AIIMS, Bhopal governing body member Alok Sanjar had said that interviews for the post of a director have been completed and is awaiting ACC approval.
 
 Dr Nagarkar's extension of service for a year as director of AIIMS, Raipur came to end on February 5. However, in light of the new MoHFW letter, sources said Dr Nagarkar will continue to head the premier institutes until the start of 24x7 service in the premier institute. AIIMS, Bhopal, which became operational in 2012 is yet to start 24x7 service. While the number of patients being treated at AIIMS has been increasing on a monthly basis, the infrastructure is yet to be fully functional to meet the growing demands of the state capital and its adjoining districts. The average indoor patient department (IPD) intake of patients for the previous year was 16 per day, for a facility with over 400 beds.
 
 Sources said that the extension of Dr Nagarkar will provide stability to the management of the two institutes in Raipur and Bhopal.
