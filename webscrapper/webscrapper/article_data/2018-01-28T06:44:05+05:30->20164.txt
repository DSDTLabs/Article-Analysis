NIZAMABAD: Bringing about a spirit of competition into the field of social entrepreneurship is a challenge, said   entrepreneur, philanthropist and founder of  , Gururaj Deshpande. 

 Speaking to STOI, he mentioned 'capacity building' as another major challenge to be tackled. 
 
 "In the case of social entrepreneurship, the beneficiary unfortunately does not pay for the innovation in many cases, something we are trying to change. Hence bringing about a competitive spirit is challenging. Although the passion is evidently present among social entrepreneurs, they lack executional excellence required in capacity building. Technology platforms, systems, policies, must be designed in order to scale an innovation up to a national level," said Deshpande. 
 
 He also stressed the need to 'co-create' social innovations. "In the private sector, a few ideas get funded and a few become public and grow into large companies. However, in most cases, they get acquired by a larger company, a process that does not happen overnight and involves several rounds of talks and review in order to set a particular standard according to the larger company's needs," he said
 
 "Similarly, we need to develop a system where people can experiment in various sectors and if innovators are able to demonstrate the feasibility of their product, the government can then go ahead and set tough standards that need to be met. If this is done, a viable innovation can be built," said Deshpande, while pointing out that tier 2 cities are comparatively better suited for social innovations. 
 
 "Tier 2 and 3 cities have to start taking pride in what they're good at. Cities like   are better suited for innovators attempting to solve issues faced by the rural population in India," he said.
