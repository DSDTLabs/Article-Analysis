PONDA: The pre-monsoon showers have raised the water level at   marginally, an official said. The water level which was at 2.6m before the showers, was raised to 3.1m on Monday. 

 Efforts are under way by the water resources department (WRD) to maintain the level by rejuvenating the river. As the water level was decreasing, a WRD official said that the situation could turn critical if there are no monsoon showers within a fortnight. However, the pre-monsoon showers on two consecutive days have raised the water level by 50cm, said the  , executive engineer and in-charge of   plant. The WRD pumps water from River Opa and supplies it to   and Tiswadi talukas.
