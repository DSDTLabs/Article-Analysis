JAIPUR: Products worth several lakhs were   in two different incidents that took place between the intervening nights of Friday and Saturday in the city. 

 In a   near  , a plywood unit was gutted after the flames engulfed the unit’s warehouse and production area on late Friday night.
 
 According fire officer Jalag Ghasiya, products worth over Rs 70 lakh were gutted. “We rushed five fire tenders in the area to contain the fire. The reason of fire is stated to be short circuit in the manufacturing unit. After two hours, we were able to douse the fire,”   said, adding that electric supply to the area was blocked for a few hours to ensure no untoward incident takes place.
 
 The fire officials added that two fire tenders from Chomu fire station were called in to douse the fire. “It seems that there was short circuit in electric cables which sparked fire. Later, the blazes also engulfed the manufacturing area inside the unit due to which some equipment was also destroyed,” added Ghasiya.
 
 In a similar fire incident, a saree showroom in Bassi area of the city caught fire and four fire tenders were sent to showroom to douse the fire. “Here too, garments worth several lakh were gutted. The electric fault had sparked the fire and soon the entire showroom was up in flames,” added Ghasiya.
 
 The residents of the nearby area informed the Bassi police station about the black smoke emanating from the window and shutter of the saree showroom. When the police reached the area they found that entire showroom was up in flames.
 
 “Several garments and other important things were burnt. Four fire tenders after one hour of exercise doused the fire,” Ghasiya said, adding that nobody was hurt in these two separate incidents of fire.
