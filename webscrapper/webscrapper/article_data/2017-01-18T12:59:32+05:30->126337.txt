SP knows that they have ruined Uttar Pradesh during their five-year rule and now the masses will give them a fitting reply),” said  ,   national general secretary and West UP in-charge. Siddiqui was in Meerut at a Bhaichara meeting for the party leaders.

  Adding that the state had suffered under the SP rule, he said that it was time for BSP supporters to come together for the betterment of the state.
  
  He further said that the state has suffered a lot in SP rule and it is time that BSP workers come together to get the state rid of them. He also said that the party was campaigning ‘quietly’ and that results would be tremendous.
  
  “We have always been on social media. We want to connect with the youth. But, we also engage in door to door campaigning. We’re doing everything at our own pace and not making any noise about the same,” added Siddiqui.
