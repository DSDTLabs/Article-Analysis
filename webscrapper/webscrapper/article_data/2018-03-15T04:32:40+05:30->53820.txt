MUMBAI: Two   from  , around 133km from Mumbai, appeared for their   exams on Tuesday, hours after their   died and the body was being taken for  .

 Vinod Chowdhary (45), a farmer from Dhundalwadi village, was ailing for a while. He passed away around 3am on Tuesday. His daughters, Pooja (15) and Deepika (16), had slept a few hours earlier after revising their lessons and had to appear for their final Geography paper on Tuesday.
 
 The Arts students of Vinay P Patil Junior College, Dapcheri, burst into tears on hearing about their father’s death. The entire village arrived at the Chowdhary household to console the sisters, two minor brothers and their mother, Sarita.
 
 Their college professor, Vinod Sonawane, rushed to the girls’ home, concerned about them appearing for the paper. “It was hard on the sisters but we convinced them to write their exam, else they would lose a year,” said Sonawane.
 
 The girls realised that by writing the exam they would be keeping their father’s dream alive. “My father wanted us to study and become independent. If we did not write the last exam, we would have lost a year. My father had spent his hardearned money on our education,” said Pooja, after she wrote the exam at Thakkar Bappa College, Talasari.
 
 When the girls left home in the morning to reach the centre, around 8km away, the villagers were preparing for the final rites. The college authorities travelled with the sisters to the exam centre and ensured they were comfortable while taking the exam. The girls reached the centre around 10.30am and the exam began half an hour later.
 
 The girls are bright in studies, said Sonawane. “They did well in all their papers. We did not want them to miss their last exam,” he added.
 
 They wrote their papers till 2pm, by when their father’s body was cremated. The girls told teachers they did well in the Geography paper too.
