Peeling onions will soon become a tear-free experience — thanks to a new breed of the pungent bulb being developed in America.

 It has taken more than 30 years of work by crop scientists to produce the “sunion” described as crunchy and full of sweetness and unlike traditional varieties won’t bring tears to the eyes.
 
 They are smaller than normal onions but if kept in a cool dark place can stay fresh for up to six months.
 
 Developed through   and not   in a laboratory, the sunion has just gone on sale in the United States but there are plans to make it available in the United Kingdom.
 
 Slicing a traditional onion releases a volatile compound called lachrymatory-factor synthase which on contact with eyes triggers the body to produce tears to reduce the irritation.
 
 In standard onions, the amount of these compounds stays the same or increases over time — but in sunions the pungency is greatly reduced and the result is a sweet, mildtasting onion that doesn’t release the gas when cut into.
 
 Currently, sunions are only being grown by farmers in Nevada and Washington where the climate is ideal for the crop.
 
 They were harvested in late summer and early autumn and now going on sale in the US until March or April, depending on supply.
 
 “We won’t allow the onions to be sold until they reach peak flavour and tearlessness,” said Lyndon Johnson, onion manager at Bayer Vegetable Seeds.
 
 “We want to ensure we have stringent quality requirements to maintain our promise of no-tears to customers.”
 
 The search for tear-free onion has long been a Holy Grail for  , scientists and farmers — a Google search over a million and a half results and YouTube videos on how to reduce the tears — ranging from freezing the onion to peeling them under water.
