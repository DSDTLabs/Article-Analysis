NEW DELHI: A senior   official has in a series of tweets praised   and lambasted  , saying the former are "disciplined" while the community of the latter is rife with "disruption, crime, and  ", reported UAEviral.com. 

 
 Dhahi Khalfan, Lieutenant General and Head of General Security in Dubai, posted these tweets after Dubai authorities arrested a gang of Pakistanis for smuggling drugs. The Pakistani press said he's known to make controversial statements. Perhaps because of that, he has a whopping 2.66 million followers. 
 
 Khalfan tweeted posting a picture of the arrested Pakistanis, with a comment below it that said, as translated by UAEviral: "Pakistanis pose a dangerous threat to gulf societies because of the drugs they bring in to our countries. We must impose strict procedures at the entrances [of our countries]."
 
  
  
 
 Then he wondered why it was that Indians are disciplined but Pakistanis aren't.
 
 "How come Indians are disciplined while disruption, crime, and smuggling are prevalent in the Pakistani community?", he tweeted.
 
 The official then went on to say that that no one in Dubai should hire Pakistanis.
 
 "I invite our citizens to not employ Pakistanis...It is now a national duty to stop hiring Pakistanis," tweeted the Dubai official.
 
 He added that Pakistanis were a "danger" to the Gulf region.
 
 "Pakistanis pose a dangerous threat to Gulf societies because of the drugs they bring in to our countries. We must impose strict procedures at the entrances [of our countries]," tweeted Khalfan.
