CHENNAI: On the eve of the launch of   Haasan’s political journey,   working president M K   on Tuesday, in a snide reference to the launch of a political party by the actor on Wednesday, said paper flowers that do not spread fragrance wilt. Kamal had called on DMK president MKarunanidhi on Sunday and Stalin had welcomed him warmly.

 In a letter to cadres, Stalin said parties may come and go, but DMK was like a banyan tree that has spread its roots and branches wide and cannot be shaken by anyone.
 
 “When seasons change, some flowers may bloom and later wilt. Similarly, in the   political arena, glamorous parties (referring to   and Rajinikant) are like paper flowers that bloom without any fragrance. But DMK is the lifeline of Tamil people in protecting their rights and language and no one can shake it. Cadres are the fence protecting the party and I being the working president have a big responsibility towards you,” said Stalin.
 
 Recently, Stalin said democracy was a “sky” for all, but few birds could cover the distance. “Enamoured by politics, new birds want to fly. Democracy is asky for all. The political arena is watching how much distance a bird can fly on its own strength,” he had stated.
 
 Observers say Stalin’s letter and its timing was aimed at keeping the DMK flock together. “DMK has been promoting family members of partymen at all levels But, a new person, who has become a member and works sincerely may feel left out. Stalin’s statement is aimed at retaining these disgruntled cadres so that they are not attracted to Kamal’s or Rajini’s party,” said senior journalist Tharasu Shyam.
