PANAJI: Union Ayush minister   said he has been regularly pursuing the matter of the inclusion of yoga as part of the school syllabus. Naik, however, clarified that he has not been pushing for it as a mandatory subject.

 “The ministry of Union human resource development (HRD) wants to introduce yoga in school syllabus and work is under way. We are also pursuing it. Since some are not in favour of the same, we will have to do it by taking everyone aboard,”   said in reply to a question at a press conference on Thursday.
 
 He said that though the HRD ministry has not formerly introduced yoga as part of the syllabus, many   have voluntarily started teaching it. “Some schools teach yoga during the physical training class. The response has been quite good,” the minister said. He also said the aim is to teach yoga from class V onwards and give weightage to the syllabus as the student goes to the next class.
