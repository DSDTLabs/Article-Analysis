KOCHI:  , a leading urological cancer and robotic surgeon at   and Asian Cancer Institute, Mumbai, never thought that one day he would foray into the world of writing.

 Dr Srinivas was in the city to introduce his first fictional book titled ‘A Tale of Two Homes’ to a group of his friends and admirers assembled at  .
 
 Regarding his new book, Dr Srinivas — who successfully built a homestay called Raven’s Nest in the lap of   by overcoming various hurdles—said that it was a fictional narrative basedon real events.
 
 “My own experiences motivated me to write the book. It is about my struggle to build a homestay in Nigiris while trying to prevent my flat in Mumbai from getting demolished. Living in a building which has been earmarked for demolition was like an emotional roller-coaster ride as the tension and stress of not having a roof over one’s head is unimaginable. My book is a mix of the best and the worst times in my life,” said Dr Srinivas.
 
 “Building a home far away while seeing my current home breaking away in front of my eyes was a painstaking experience. But I have presented the story through the prism of humour by giving it a comic rendition,” he said.
 
 The book title may sound very similar to ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ written by writer Charles Dickens in 1859. “The two books might share a common name and hence mightbecompared. But this comparison ends there,” he said.
 
 “When my wife said that she was looking for a second getaway hope in Goa, I didn’t agree with it as there won’t be much difference as the weather in Goa was hot like that in Mumbai. I was looking for a place where the air is fresher. Finally, wedecidedto makeNigiris our second home and my love for the hill station played a significant role in it,” he said.
