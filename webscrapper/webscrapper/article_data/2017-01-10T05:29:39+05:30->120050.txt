THANE: A 41-year-old NRI-based in London was arrested for allegedly partnering with her brother to dupe a relative of Rs23 crore on the false promise of investing it in the realty market. 

 Neishaa   was detained at the   last week following a lookout notice issued by the Thane police for her alleged role in conning Rajesh Tailor (55) along with the other accused Pavan  , who is in custody. 
 
 "We had issued a lookout notice against Gharat and her husband   for extorting Rs23.56 crore from Tailor. Gharat had flown from London, while her husband, a dentist, is still in England. She was arrested on January 3," said police inspector BS Tambe.
 
 Kulavoor was arrested on a complaint lodged by Tailor.
 
  "Kulavoor claimed to be a businessman and had asked me to give him money to construct buildings," said Tailor. As he is a distant relative, he and his family gained my trust and duped me. For seven years he and his family extorted money from me. In July 2015, when he called me up and threatened me to not visit the country, I realized that I was being cheated." 
 
 Tailor and Kulavoorentered into a partnership in 2006. It was decided that the NRI would finance the projects and Kulavoor would supervise operations.
