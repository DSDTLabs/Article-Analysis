CHANDIGARH: For A   and his family members from Sector 51, the yearly   during the summers has already started afflicting them from Friday. Currently, there is no water supply in their house.

 
 And they are not the only ones. Around 70 more houses are reeling under severe water crisis. In addition to it, 1112 houses have no water supply in the evening. The worst affected are the residents who are on first and second floors as they have low water supply in their houses in the morning too.
 
 
 Mandal expressed shock that the area despite boasting plenty of ground water, faces the same crisis every summer. He added he had appealed to the municipal corporation to install more   in the area to eradicate the problem of low pressure water supply since a survey revealed there was plenty of ground water in the area.
 
 
 He said the residents are dependent on the boosters to get their overhead water tanks filled. The society booster comes to the rescue of the group housing. If sufficient numbers of tube wells are installed in the area, the issue can be resolved easily.
 
 
 Parveen Garg, member of the citizen welfare society said that the root of the problem is the genset which is installed on the water booster in the area. This has not been operational for the past six months. As and when there is no electricity in the area, the residents are bereft of water. S S Bhardwaj, president of the citizen welfare society informed TOI that they demanded expansion of the water storage at Sector 52 because of an increase in the occupancy for which Rs 16 crore was sanctioned but the work hasnâ€™t started yet.
