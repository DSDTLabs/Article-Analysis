Panchkula: A day after TOI team conducted a reality check at the petrol pumps for selling loose petrol openly,   deputy commissioner Gauri Prasher Joshi directed the District Foods and Supply Controller (DFSC) to conduct an inspection of the petrol pumps.

 When contacted   Joshi, she said there is already a restriction on selling loose petrol. But soon after the violence that took place in Panchkula on August 25, Section 144 was imposed whereby there would be a ban on selling of loose petrol to any individual.
 
 DC further informed that she has instructed the DFSC to conduct a survey of the district and take strict action against the persons found violating the law. She said, “I have asked DFSC to ensure all petrol pumps are following the guidelines issued by the administration. I have also asked them to conduct a special drive in this direction. In any case, if a person is found guilty, a strict action would be taken against them.”
 
 On Monday, TOI team throughout the Tricity in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali purchased loose petrol from petrol pumps, which were easily available.
 
 According to Petroleum Act, 1934, loose petrol cannot be possessed until safety measures are met, making its sale difficult. However, administrations invoked Section 144 to enforce a ban on the sale of loose petrol.
