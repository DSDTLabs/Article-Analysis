CHENNAI: The TN government is yet to declare beneficiaries for several Central welfare schemes, and now has to fulfill new norms to avail funds for certain schemes. With the Centre insisting that states must complete the process of Aadhaar seeding with bank accounts for SC, OBC students scholarships, state officials say that the process is underway and will be completed soon.

 A document released by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment on Monday, states that last year, the TN government submitted direct benefit transfer (DBT) for all schemes, and that a total of 21,08,776 beneficiaries have been declared with 37% bank accounts and 37% Aadhaar seeding in the beneficiary database.
 
 Atul Anand, Commissioner in-charge, Backward Classes Welfare, told TOI, “We have already completed 96% of the Aadhaar seeding process for schemes in our department, including the pre and post matric scholarships”. He added that around 10,000 beneficiaries are left and that the process will be completed in a month or two.
 
 The state is yet to declare beneficiaries for pre-matric and post-matric scholarships for SC students for the last two years and has not submitted fresh proposals to build hostels for SC students. The state has been proactive in schemes pertaining to Protection of Civil Rights Act, Prevention of Atrocities Act, rehabilitation of manual scavengers, prevention of alcoholism and drug abuse and BC skill development.
 
 Former MP and former member of the National Commission for Backward Classes, S K Kharventhan, alleged that despite repeated requests, the state government “does not send lists of beneficiaries to the Centre for several schemes”.
