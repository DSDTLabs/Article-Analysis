NAVI MUMBAI: Citizens and environmentalists have claimed that there is a revival in   at certain sites in   taluka but   district authorities state they are regularly taking action against illegal sand-mining in their jurisdiction.

 A local activist recently intimated Raigad district collectorate and Panvel tehsil office about illegal sand-mining at Vaghivali, near Jui Kamothe.
 
  
  
 “There were around six boats loaded with suction pumps to do illegal sand-mining at Vaghivali on Sunday. We have taken long-shot pictures across the sea creek, and intimated the authorities about it. This must be stopped,” said an activist.
 
 Sources said the wet sand illegally collected from Vaghivali is transported to another spot nearby, from where it is taken in vehicles to be sold at construction sites.
 
 Environmentalist Sumaira Abdulali said, “I had complained about revival of sand-mining next to Savitri river in Mahad earlier this year. Bullock carts were seen at Kihim and Awas beaches, near Alibag, to take away precious sand, which denudes the picturesque coast. Top state officials and the chief minister must come up with a   plan to completely end this illegal activity that is devastating our environment.”
 
 Panvel tehsildar Deepak Akade said, “We are regularly monitoring all sensitive sites where sand-mining used to occur. But we have not come across any instance of illegal sand-mining in the taluka. Even at Ganeshpuri, where   had complained about sand-mining, there is no illegal activity.” But he added that if there are fresh complaints, they will again check them so that it ceases for good.
 
 TOI had recently reported about illegal sand-mining near the railway bridge next to Juinagar station in Navi Mumbai. It had stopped after environmentalists reported about it to the district authorities, but locals pointed that the sand-miners sometimes return on public holidays when government offices are closed.
 
 Another activist, Anarjit Chauhan, reiterated, “Besides filing FIRs, officials must apply strong Acts like MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act), Environment Protection Act and contempt of court (for use of motorized suction pumps) as there is a mafia behind such sand-mining activities, which is literally looting Mother Nature. Only strong punishment, like a jail term, can serve as a strong deterrent.”
