CHARMINAR: Despite being among the oldest bridges of Hyderabad, the   lies in a shambles now. With the old bridge being taken over by the vendors, motorists and the pedestrians have been left with no space and facing a tough commuting along this stretch.Worse, with authorities turning a blind eye, the bridge has turned into an open urinal space and dumping yard for the local residents.

 “The foul smell emitting from the bridge is unbearable and spreads all over the vicinity. Instead of ensuring that the bridge is kept neat and clean, officials concerned have gone silent on the issue. Though several complaints have been registered with the authorities concerned regarding the problems of commuters, nothing has been done to improve the condition of the bridge,“ said  , a resident of the Mustaidpura.
 
 Apart from the civic workers, even common citizens are responsible for the plight of the Puranapul, say the commuters using the flyover next to the bridge to travel to various destinations in the city .
 
 “Though scores of people use this bridge, which has also become a place of earning money for vendors, none of them are willing to take any responsibility to maintain it properly .It is extremely sad to see the current situation that the bridge is in. People must also do their bit to keep the bridge neat and clean,“ said Jameel, another motorist.
 
 Locals, meanwhile, urged the   (GHMC) authorities to turn their attention to the condition of the bridge and do the needful soon.
 
 It was way back in 1578 AD that this bridge was built over the River Musi. According to the chapters of history , it is the first bridge ever constructed in the city and among the oldest in South India. It was constructed during the reign of the   dynasty to connect the   with Hyderabad.
