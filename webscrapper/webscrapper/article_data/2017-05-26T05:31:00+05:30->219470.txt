A lot has been spoken about   and Shraddha Kapoor’s sizzling chemistry in ‘Half Girlfriend’, but when Bombay Times recently met the actor and asked him if the two shared a great rapport as kids, Arjun said, “We have met each other at just the typical clichéd birthday parties as kids. She is younger than me, her brother is my friend. We were an acquaintance but we were always comfortable around each other, even when we met at social events and all there was an ease to us and so there was nothing that we had to break the ice per say.” 

 Though   and Madhav’s chemistry is the film was well received by the audience , the film failed to garner the same response.
