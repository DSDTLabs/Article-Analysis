MUMBAI:   will launch a new postpaid plan with monthly rental of Rs 199 from May 15, which will offer   at 50 paise per minute and international roaming at Rs 2 per minute. Currently, it offers a Rs 309 monthly rental postpaid plan, which is its lowest tariff deal. 

 
 For the Rs 199 monthly-rental plan, customers will not have to pay any security deposit for availing international calling services. The plan also offers unlimited   and 25 GB data, among other services.   will offer calls at 50 paise per minute to the US and Canada, Rs 2 per minute to the UK, France and Singapore, and Rs 3 per minute to Hong Kong and Malaysia. Calls to the Middle East, Israel and Nigeria will be charged at Rs 6 per minute. Jio will offer international roaming at Rs 2 per minute for voice, Rs 2 per MB and Rs 2 per SMS in the US, the UK, Singapore and the UAE. 
 
 Jio will also launch three postpaid packs of Rs 575, Rs 2,875 and Rs 5,751 — offering unlimited voice and data. However, these three will be valid for one, seven and 30 days respectively.
 
 “These plans will once again challenge the industry status quo by offering the lowest tariffs in India and abroad to postpaid users, who end up paying disproportionately higher as compared with the prepaid segment,” Jio said in a statement. “These highly attractive and customer friendly tariffs will help customers to remain connected wherever they are without worrying about bill shocks they have been used to for years,” Jio added.
