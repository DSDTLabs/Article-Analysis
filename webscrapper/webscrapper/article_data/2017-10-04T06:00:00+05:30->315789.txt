Looks like director   might just win Balakrishna’s nod to direct the much awaited   biopic. Speaking to Hyderabad Times, the   filmmaker says, “Yes, I have been approached to direct the biopic on NTR garu. I’ve met   garu a few times in this regard and a decision will be taken soon. Personally, I’m a huge fan of NTR garu and I’m a bit nervous as well. Besides being one of the most loved matinee idols, NTR garu is one of the greatest political leaders India has produced. Depicting his life on screen is no easy job. I want to make sure that I would be able to do absolute justice to the project.” 

 
  will be essaying the role of his father, former Chief Minister of united  , NTR in the biopic. Admittedly, the filmmaker has four other offers in hand, but if things go according to plan, then he will choose NTR’s biopic over every other project.
