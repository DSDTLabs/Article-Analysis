The committee, chaired by the sub-collector, has the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) divisional environmental engineer as the co-ordinator. It comprises of the joint director of agriculture, personal assistant (agriculture) to collector, farmers’ representatives K Rajamani and A Eswaramurthy and dying units’ representatives S Selvakumar and R Ramasamy. It should conduct inspection twice a month or whenever a complaint is made and also should report to collector KS Palanisamy every month. The collector constituted the committee following a tripartite meeting held to discuss the allegations raised by farmers in Ganapathipalayam and Karaiputhur panchayats, where as many as 40 large dyeing units are functioning. In a report, the agricultural department had said though soil in the region was not polluted, groundwater salt level had gone up. A senior revenue official said, “As the committee has representation from the farmers and the Dyers Association of Tirupur, apart from revenue and agricultural officials, it would act as a supervising body.” Meanwhile, some of the farmers from Ganapathipalayam said that the committee comprises of farmers, who could act in favour of the polluters.
