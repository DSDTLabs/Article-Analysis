Vadodara: Dilip Rana, a resident of Fatehpura, was arrested on Sunday by police in connection with a theft case registered at Raopura police station last month. Rana had stolen Rs 1 lakh cash from his employer’s surgical tools shop near Jubileebaug.

 Interestingly, the complainant Dharamveer Arora had lodged the complaint against his another employee – Ramesh Chavda. Arora had stated that Chavda used duplicate key of his shop and had entered in the wee hours of January 12. He stole the cash which were kept in a drawer.
 
 During investigation, the police learnt that Chavda had no role in the theft. Cops then focussed the investigation on the role and behaviour of other employees working in Arora’s shop. A police official said that he had formed a surveillance team to keep a tab on other employees during which they learnt that Rana had not visited his home since the theft and after few days he had even stopped coming for work.
 
 When the police checked Rana’s crime record, it came to light that he was a regular gambler and was even arrested in the past by City police station. On Sunday, after he was nabbed, Rana admitted to committing the crime as he wanted money for gambling. Out of the stolen money, cops could recover Rs 62,000 from him.
