PATNA: Reacting over PM Narendra Modi’s ‘raincoat in bathroom’ remark on his predecessor Manmohan Singh, Bihar CM   on Monday said one should always use dignified language.

 “Debates take place in democracy. People put forward their views during such debates. But the language should not be objectionable,” Nitish told reporters after his weekly ‘Lok Samvad’ programme here. 
 
 Nitish, who is also the JD(U) national president, further said people should maintain “certain standard” in their speech. “If you are holding a big and high post, your language must be of that standard,” he said without taking anyone’s name.
 
 In an oblique reference to Modi’s ‘DNA’ barb against him during the 2015 assembly elections in Bihar, Nitish said, “Different sorts of undignified remarks were made against me, but I never broke the barrier of dignity. I never lowered the standard of political debates.”
 
 To a question, Bihar CM also denied making a U-turn on the issue of demonetisation and asserted his views that the Centre must tell the people about the benefits of note ban. “It is an interpretation of media that I have made a U-turn on the note ban issue. I made my viewpoints on demonetisation very clear during a recent panel discussion in New Delhi, in my speech during the birth anniversary celebrations of socialist leader   in Patna on January 24 last and also during my reaction on the general budget on February 1,” CM said.
 
 “Large number of working people, especially those in unorganized sectors, have been adversely affected by the demonetisation. Several people have lost their jobs. The Centre should take necessary steps to ensure that people who have been rendered jobless should get alternate source of income,” he said.
 
 Nitish also said he had asserted time and again that no drive against black money would yield desired results unless an effective drive is launched against the holders of ‘benami’ properties across the country.
