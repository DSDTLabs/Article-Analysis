AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday issued notice to the state government over a petition filed by a life term convict in the 2002 Sardarpura massacre case, who has been seeking remission in sentence on the ground that he suffers from HIV infection.

 One of 17 convicts in this case, whose punishment of life imprisonment was upheld by the high court in last October, has filed a petition in the high court seeking directions to the   authorities to follow a state government circular issued in 2013 to consider granting remission to a prisoner in cases of HIV/AIDS and cancer.
 
 Petitioner’s advocate   said that the convict suffers from HIV infection since 2009. This is the third occasion on which the convict has raised the issue of remission before jail authorities. 
 
 When his application was not considered for the first time, he moved the high court which directed the jail authorities and the state government to take a decision on the issue within stipulated time.
 
 However, officials did not take any decision on the convict’s representation. The convict made applications twice again, but failed to get any response. This led him to move the HC once again.
 
 After issuing notice to the state government and the jail superintendent ,   has kept further hearing in June.
 
 Thirty-three persons, mostly women and children, were burnt alive in a room locked from outside by a violent mob in north Gujarat village of Sardarpura on March 1, 2002. 
 
 In 2011, a special SIT court convicted 31 persons and handed down life imprisonment to them. Last year, Gujarat high court upheld conviction for 17 persons, whereas it acquitted 14 others.
