NAGPUR: Unclaimed deposits lying with the Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( ) have always been a topic of debate. Now, an   query has brought to fore that a whopping Rs351.15 crore are lying with EPFO’s regional office at Nagpur. This huge amount belongs to over 7.56 lakh employees, who have failed to claim their hard-earned money.

 The reply by EPFO’s central public information officer (CPIO) RW   also informed that over 16.66 lakh employees have been enrolled with the Nagpur office till February-end this year. He, however, failed to reply to a couple of queries by RTI activist Abhay  , who sought information on criminal cases filed against companies for not depositing provident fund of employees from January 1, 2017, to February 28, 2018. Even information on how many persons were convicted and sentenced for withholding PF was not provided.
 
 Thule, however, informed that there are seven types of pension provided by EPFO, apart from those at superannuation. These include pension for children, disabled and widows as well.
 
 According to Kolarkar, the PF accounts become dormant and the funds remain unclaimed when employees don’t claim it after retirement. However, reasons like official discrepancies, corruption, red-tapism, and issues in the online application are never been accounted.
 
 He lamented that EPFO or banks didn’t make any effort to contact the depositors or their nominees regarding unclaimed PF money. “Even if you try to claim it, they raise suspicion and force you to go through long and tedious procedure of providing documents, including making an affidavit. On the other hand, there is always a threat of unclaimed money getting siphoned off by unscrupulous elements,” the activist said.
