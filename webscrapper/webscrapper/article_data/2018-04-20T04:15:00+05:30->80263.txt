Vadodara: Women from the city won’t have to search for affordable sanitary napkins now.  A city-based foundation has decided to install sanitary napkin vending machines at 21 different locations in the city. On Thursday, two vending machines were inaugurated at the GSRTC depot in the presence of Vadodara MP Ranjan Bhatt. Swati Bedekar, who has launched the project under brand name ‘Sakhi’, said that they will install more vending machines at public places in the coming months. “We installed the first two at the ST depot as women frequent this place. Many times women, who arrive at the depot from outside, have to search for sanitary napkins. These machines will come in handy for them,” Bedekar told TOI. The vending machines will be installed at new district court premises, women’s hostel, M S University, railway platform, aanganwadis and Makarpura bus depot. “The idea behind installing such machines is that we want to make sanitary napkins accessible to every woman. We have made sanitary napkins popular in rural areas and now we are focusing in the urban localities,” Bedekar added. The vending machine that has been designed by Bedekar’s husband doesn’t need electricity to function. The user has to put in a Rs five coin and the machine will give out two napkins. The sanitary napkins dished out by the vending machines are being made at the manufacturing units run by Vatsalya Foundation that was started by Bedekar. The Vadodara division of railways has already kept a sanitary napkin machine in the waiting room on International Women’s Day last month.
