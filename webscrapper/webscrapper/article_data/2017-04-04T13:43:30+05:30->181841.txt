PUNE: The Shop Act licence allows a bakery to appoint only one worker, but in the case of a bakery in Kondhwa three partners had illegally employed six workers who suffocated to death in a fire on December 30, 2016, pointed out the charge sheet filed by police in the Pune cantonment court recently. 

 Investigations have revealed that the partners Abdulla Chiniwar (27) from NIBM Road, Mohammad Ansari (24) from Hadapsar and Mohammad Chiniwar (59) from   had failed to adopt security measures and intentionally locked rolling shutters from outside, thereby preventing the escape of workers when the fire broke out.
 
 The workers were sleeping on the mezzanine floor of "bakes N cakes", a bakery located at Ganga Avenue Co-operative Housing Society on Kondhwa-Saswad Road in Pune, when a huge fire erupted due to a short circuit around 4.30 am.
 
 The deceased were   (27), Shanu Naseem Ansari (22),   (23), Fahim Naseem Ansari (21), Nazim alias Zubaid Naeem Ansari (25) and Feroz Raees Ansari (21) -- all from Uttar Pradesh.
 
 The charge sheet, filed by inspector Varsharani Patil from the Kondhwa Police Station, said the partners had illegally extended the mezzanine floor without obtaining permission from the   (PMC) and allowed workers to cook, eat, stay and prepare bakery products on the floor.
 
 Lawyer M. M. Sayyed, who represented the partners, said on Monday that the charge sheet has been transferred to the district and sessions court for conducting trial. The court has reserved its order on the bail applications, he added.
