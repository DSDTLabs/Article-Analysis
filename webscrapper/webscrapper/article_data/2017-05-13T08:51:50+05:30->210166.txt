HYDERABAD: Drafting of a new students' union constitution has become a bone of contention between the students and   (UoH) administration as a few students have now raised objections to administration's proposal to appoint vice-chancellor,  , as the patron of the union. 

 Earlier, on April 24, students held a protest against the draft constitution in front of the dean of students' welfare office. Subsequently on May 10 , Kuldeep  , president of students' union was issued a showcause notice by the chief proctor over the protest. 
 
 Students have condemned the move claiming that by amending the students' union constitution, the university is trying to curb its rights. "The students union is an autonomous body and cannot have the VC as its patron. If we ever protest against any kind of anti-student policies, the VC as the patron of the union will have the power to dissolve the union any time, which is unacceptable," said Nagi. 
 
  Varsity officials, however, argue that the move is only aimed at legalising the present system. "The students' union constitution is being re-written by the university since the present constitution under which the union is formed has no sanctity. The committee constituted by the university will draft proper constitution as is required by the ordinances. However, whether the VC will be a patron of the varsity or other clauses on which students have raised objections are yet to be decided by the committee," said  , pro-vice-chancellor 1 of UoH.
