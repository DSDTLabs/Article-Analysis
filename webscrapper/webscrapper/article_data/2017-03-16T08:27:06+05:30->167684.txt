KOCHI: Rekindling the hopes of constructing 185 million litre a day (MLD) drinking water treatment plant and distribution network at  , chief minister   has assured that the government will explore all possibilities to allot land for the project. Responding to the submission by   MLA, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government will soon convene a meeting of all the stakeholders.

 Chief minister said that the   (KWA), which is to implement the project, has identified land which is suitable for construction of the plant in Karumaloor panchayat. There is also plan to buy six acres required for the project from HMT. A meeting of officials of various departments and people's representatives and ministers concerned will discuss these issues.
 
 Though the foundation stone of the plant was laid by former chief minister   in February , 2016, the work couldn't be started as Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Kinfra) failed to hand over six acres of land required for the project. The state government has already given administrative sanction for the project and earmarked Rs 235 crore. The Kinfra had promised to give the land, but later they informed that the land is hooked in the legal dispute. “The project which would have solved the drinking water problems in many areas including Kalamassery , Eloor, Thrikkakara and Che ranelloor remain hooked in unavailability of land. This is one of the major drinking water project in the district. So, the government should take urgent measures to allot land for it,“ Hibi Eden said.
 
 The project, designed by KWA almost two years ago, has been facing problems mainly due to the lack of land for constructing the plant.
 
 The plant will treat the water from the river Periyar. A 7km-long inflow pipeline will be constructed to bring water from Eloor to the proposed plant. Water will be supplied to Eloor, Kalamassery, Thrikkakara, Maradu, Chellanam, Kumbalam and Kumbalanghi municipalities and Kochi city.
