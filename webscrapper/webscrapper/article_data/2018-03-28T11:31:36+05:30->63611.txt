THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The police are yet to zero in on the real motive behind the murder of R  , but they have reasons to believe that a woman might be at the centre of the mystery. Rajesh was talking to her on phone when he was attacked by assailants and she heard his screams and panicked.

 At the same time, she alerted Rajesh’s friends, who were heading towards the studio after their programme. They in turn alerted the police. “We know that this woman, who lives abroad, made several attempts to reach his friends to alert them before one of them responded,” said Kilimanoor CI SV  , who is investigating the case.
 
 Police, however, did not identify the woman.
 
 Rajesh’s body was given to his kin after an autopsy and inquest. There were 20 wounds on his body, of which three were deep and potentially fatal. His right wrist was almost chopped off. Another wound below the right knee broke his bone and the third one was on the calf of his left leg. Police believe that he died due to excessive bleeding.
 
 The inspector said that Rajesh and Kuttan reached the studio on a bike. Rajesh went home and returned with some food for Kuttan. Then he went inside the studio called the woman and then the assailants arrived.
 
 Kumar added that the woman and Rajesh got acquainted with each other while Rajesh was working at a radio station in Doha. Police suspect that his sudden return from Qatar six months ago might have something to do with the issues triggered by this relationship.
 
 Also, Rajesh was to leave for Chennai early on Wednesday morning on a business trip. Kumar said that the police could not contact this woman or her husband and make inquiries as they were still abroad. Police are now trying to locate the car used by the assailants. Kuttan has told the police that he can identify the attackers.
