KOCHI: The lax attitude of authorities has once again come to the fore as people’s protest became a near success with the   (KWA) officials straining their nerves on Monday to reinstate water supply to the colonies where the pipes had gone dry for over a week.

 More than 300 people were forced to leave their homes and camp on the road from Vyttila to Tripunithura at Thykkoodam on Sunday, blocking the traffic as the promise to reinstate water supply remained unfulfilled till late night. 
 
 The residents, around 100 of them, were charged with sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 283 (obstruction in public way) r/w 149 of the IPC.
 
 Residents in Thykkoodam, MES, Mountain and   had blocked the road on Sunday night disrupting traffic for a few hours. The protesters had called off the strike late night after officials promised water supply by Monday night. 
 
 Vyttila councillor P S Shine said that the work on the pipeline was progressing. “The water supply is expected to be reinstated by midnight,” said the councillor. 
 
 “KWA has been supplying water through old six-inch pipelines and water was not reaching every household due to low pressure. The relaying work was done to ensure availability of water,” said the councillor.
