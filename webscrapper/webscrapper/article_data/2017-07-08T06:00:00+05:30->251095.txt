Visakhapatnam: City girl Sharanya Mudundi was crowned the 'Little Miss Grand Sea Intercontinental' at Grand Sea Universe-2017 held in Sofia, Bulgaria, recently. Adding feathers to her cap, she also won the titles 'Little Miss Grand Sea Asia-2017', 'Miss Popularity' and 'Best Interview' at the fashion  .

 Nine-year-old Sharanya represented India and competed with children from 30 countries. She also won the title ‘Little Model Earth India-2017’ and ‘Grand Prix Winner Model-2017’ at an international children’s pageant 'Little Model Earth' held at Johannesburg, South Africa, in March this year.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sharanya said, “I was on cloud nine after I won the titles at Sofia. Although it was a challenging task, bagging these has boosted my confidence. The theme being 'Beauty for a purpose', there were different rounds during the contest including interview round, national costume round, talent round and evening gown round. I also showcased our rich Indian culture and traditions. I performed yoga in the talent round and it was one of my memorable experience at the global fashion stage." 
 
 Daughter of MSN Raju and M Swati, Sharanya is a Class-V student in Delhi Public School. Balancing both academics and fashion shows, she said that it is the support of her parents coupled with time management that helps her to focus on both. 
 
 National Director of India Valentina Mishra, who hails from the city, said, "She is the only Indian girl child to represent India on the global map and to win at an international pageant twice this year." Valentina was awarded the winner of best director of the year by MMSEA BG, an international agency.
