AHMEDABAD:   Ramdas Athawale on Sunday called for amending the law to raise the upper limit for caste-based reservations beyond the 50% set by the  . He said this will reduce   who are accused by upper castes of usurping their jobs through reservations. 

 Athawale called for 25% quota for economically backward classes (EBC) in jobs and education “to avoid caste-conflicts.” He said that Parliament should soon amend the law to make this possible.
 
 “In Gujarat, Hardik Patel is demanding reservation for Patels while in Haryana, Jats are demanding quota,” Athawale said. “Similarly, there is a demand from quota from Rajputs in Rajasthan and Marathas in Maharashtra.” 
 
 He was speaking to journalists at a press conference at the circuit house in Shahibaug area of Ahmedabad.
 
 “At present, there is 49.5% reservation for SC, ST and OBCs. If 25% reservation from general seats is given to members of quota-seeking castes such as Patels, Rajputs, Brahmins, Baniya or Marathas, total reservations will reach 75%.” Athawale said. He said the the reservations for EBCs should be limited to families having annual income of less than Rs 8 lakh.
