Navi Mumbai: In a brazen daylight robbery on a   street, two   robbed an engineering student of Rs 2 lakh while he was waiting at a bus stop. 

 The incident occurred around 6.15 pm on April 30 near the Rapid Action Force camp on Kharghar-Taloja Road.
 
 The student has been identified as Johar Ali Shaikh, 22, a resident of sector 12, Kharghar. According to the police, the victim was carrying the cash in a polythene bag which he had hung on his bike handle, parked near the bus stop at Papdichapada near the RAF camp. He was waiting for his brother as they had planned to go to an engineering college in Mahad, Raigad district, where Shaikh had to deposit the money toward his admission fees. 
 
 Spotting Shaikh alone near the bus stop, two strangers on a bike came up to him and asked directions to an address in Owe village. While the bike rider kept Shaikh engaged in conversation, the pillion rider snatched Shaikh's polythene bag and both sped way. 
 
 Shaikh chased them on his bike, but in vain. He later informed his brother and they went to Kharghar police station where an FIR has been registered against the duo under sections 392 (punishment for robbery) and 34 (common intention) of IPC.
 
 Senior inspector Dilip Kale said, "We have zeroed in on the suspects and got some leads about their whereabouts. A police team is on their trail out of the city and will nab them soon."
