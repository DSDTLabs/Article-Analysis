Shhh... says the guide as he walks visitors through the “designated bat zone“ in the backyard of the  . “They're fast asleep. So we prefer not to disturb them.“

 While visitors -especially in the late evenings -have come across swarms of fruit bats hurtling through the grounds before flying into the night only to return at daybreak, few may know that the museum authorities decided to make the area a `silent zone' so as not to frighten the flighty mammals. “We allow people to speak in this part of the museum premises only in the evenings,“ he adds.
 
 For more than two decades the grove behind the museum's   has been home to more than 2,000 Indian flying foxes (a species of fruit bat), but it was only in 2012 that a board was put up stating the significance of the area. The plaque states there are 49 species of fauna on the premises that support the fruit bat. This information was based on a World Wildlife Fund survey , which also studied the trees (in this case tamarind, copper pod and sapota) where they make their home.
 
 “There are a few areas in the city like Theosophical Society and   where fruit bats are found.But the museum is the largest habitat,“ says G Vijay Kumar, honorary secretary of Madras Naturalists' Society .
 
 The plaque unfortunately now lies under a heap of branch es and leaves, h av i n g b e e n knocked to the ground along with several trees after Vardah stormed through the grounds last month.
 
 After the cyclone the bat population is said to have been reduced by more than 30%.“The cyclone killed many, while several of them have disappeared. We are hoping they return because they are critical to the ecosystem,“ says one, explaining that fruit bats (through their excreta) are efficient pollinators.
