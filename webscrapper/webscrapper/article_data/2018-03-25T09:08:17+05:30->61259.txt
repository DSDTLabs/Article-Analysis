 A majority of those arrested for snatching get bail quickly, sometimes just a day or two â€” a fact the police have acknowledged. In its report to the Punjab and Haryana high court, police said most of the accused in snatching cases are repeat offenders. This because the accused are arrested under weaker Sections 356 (criminal force during theft) and 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code ( ). Under Section 379 (theft), the punishment ranges from a fine to a maximum of three years in prison. Under Section 356 (criminal force during theft), the punishment is a maximum of two years in jail. They are released on a cash surety, which generally ranges from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000.
 
 However, in Mohali and Panchkula, snatchers are booked under Sections 379B and 382 of the IPC. The Chandigarh Police had sent a proposal to the ministry of home affairs to book the accused under stringent sections. Police had sought approval to add Sections 365 B and 379 A of the IPC in cases of snatching. The minimum jail term under Section 379 A would be five years, which could go up to 10 years.
 
 
 
 
 The high court was recently told that despite repeated communications, the ministry had not given a positive response to amend the IPC to book snatchers under stringent sections. The high court had recently issued a notice to ministry of home affairs secretary to file its reply by the next date of hearing on April 3. The court had taken note of the spurt in snatchings after advocate H C Arora had filed a public interest litigation (PIL). The petitioner had sought directions to the police to take effective steps to check snatching incidents.
 
 In its report to the high court, police had stated that out of 77 persons arrested in 2014, 24 were released within seven days, 15 within 15 days and 14 within 30 days. So, 53 out of the 70 arrested were back on the roads within a month of their arrest.
 
 The trend continued in 2015 as well. Out of the 122 persons arrested, 34 were released on bail within seven days, 31 within 15 days and 18 within 30 days. Till March 2016, out of 37 people arrested for snatchings, 21 were released within seven days, five within 15 days and four within 30 days.
