  : The chaos at pick-n-drop zone of the   has become a nuisance for flyers with honking vehicles causing hold-ups and delays. 

 The facility, which was supposed to regulate vehicles movement in rush hour, provides six minutes of free-time to a vehicle, but hardly any vehicle meets this deadline and ends up paying up for the delay.
 
 From the parking lot, one needs to walk down to reach the terminal with an elevated curve. As the distance between parking lot and terminal is around 300 metres, passengers often take their vehicles to the pick-n-drop zone causing jams. Outside the terminal, private taxis continue to pile up in front of the arrival terminal, causing inordinate delays.
 
  Imposing fine on violators at the pick-n-drop lane has failed to make things better. Authorities last year started imposing a fine of Rs 250 on vehicles parked in that area. 
 
 Even officials lost steam in due course. "In the past two years I did a lot of work. However, the biggest disappointment was that despite taking several measures illegal parking outside the terminal could not be stopped due to lack of support from visitors," said airport director  , who has been transferred to Srinagar airport. 
 
 The way taxis and other vehicles block the lane, it's almost impossible to move out of the area in the six minutes free-time. 
 
  Visitors are forced to pay the parking fee due to illegal parking. "Is it my fault if I could not come out of the airport due to illegal parking? Why would I pay money when I did not commit any mistake," said  , a Bhopal-based IT professional.
