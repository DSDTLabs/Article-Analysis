PATNA: RLSP chief and Union minister   met RJD chief   at   in Delhi on Thursday night, giving rise to speculations over political realignments in Bihar ahead of 2019 general election.

 Lalu, who is currently serving a jail term in connection with the fodder scam, was on Thursday admitted to the Delhi hospital for treatment.
 
 Lalu’s younger son and leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said in Patna on Friday morning that Kushwaha’s was a courtesy call. “But we will welcome Kushwaha if he joins us because he is feeling suffocated in the NDA. We will in fact welcome everyone from the NDA except CM Nitish Kumar,” Tejashwi told reporters.
 
 Though Kushwaha has denied any plan to quit the NDA, the RJD has openly invited him to their fold on several occasions in recent months. 
 
 Once considered close to Nitish, Kushwaha parted ways with him and floated the RLSP in 2013. Sources said he started feeling uncomfortable in the NDA ever since Nitish-led JD (U) rejoined the alliance and formed the government in the state in July last year.
 
 The RJD also appears to be wooing leaders of Ram Vilas Paswan-led LJP. “There’s a move to form an anti-BJP front ahead of the 2019 general election. I appeal to like-minded LJP leaders, except Ram Vilas, to join hands with us the way (HAM-S president Jitan Ram) Manjhi-ji did,” Tejashwi told newsmen on Thursday.
 
 Citing neglect by the NDA leadership, former CM Manjhi quit the BJP-led alliance and joined the Grand Alliance of RJD and   on February 28.
