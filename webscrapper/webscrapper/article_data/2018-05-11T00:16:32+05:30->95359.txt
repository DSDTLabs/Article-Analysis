To cash in on the success of their premium stores that have been setting record sales,   plans to remodel the stores, starting with the outlet at Power House in Thiruvananthapuram.

 “We plan to float small independent tenders. Our plan is to make these modelling changes in about Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh and not spend too much money. The remodelling will make the stores appear much more modernized, with good interiors and exteriors, so that customers would feel more comfortable,” said H Venkatesh, managing director, Bevco.
 
 The revamp of the store in Thiruvananthapuram is a pilot project. Officials from Bevco said that they plan to revamp other premium stores across the states depending on the results at the new store.
 
 The current senior officials at Bevco have approved the designs of the interiors and exteriors proposed as part of the renovation work at the Bevco outlet on Power House road.
 
 Venkatesh said that the renovation work at the store would begin at the end of the month after the tenders are prepared and awarded. and the store would be ready in 25 days.
 
 Apart from this, Bevco will float another tender to digitalize their infrastructure. Venkatesh said that the digitalization of their stores would enhance their bookkeeping and inventory movement, making it easier for the company to study customer needs and choices.
 
 They also plan on introducing card payments at the point of sale across all their stores. Currently, this facility is available only at 100 outlets.
