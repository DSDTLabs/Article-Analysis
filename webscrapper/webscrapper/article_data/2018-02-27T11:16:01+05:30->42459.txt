KOTTAYAM:   (SWTD) is all set to launch the first solar-powered cruise boat in the country. The multi-purpose cruise boat is under construction at a private boatyard in Aroor. The construction of the boat, which will cost Rs 3.5 crore, is expected to be completed in nine months.

 The cruise boat is designed for holding meetings, gatherings and parties. It has two decks with the lower one an airconditioned one. There are 100 pushback seats in the lower deck. The upper deck is open and can be used for parties or serving food. There is also a small space which can be used as a kitchen and as storage area. The boat will operate between   and   and the bookings can be made at either of the boat stations.
 
 
 SWTD director Shaji V Nair said the work was in full swing ever since the design was cleared by the   ( ).
 
 The concept design was by the department of ship technology of the   (CUSAT). The boat is also a hybrid one as it can be operated using a generator and can also be charged from a grid. The air conditioner operates on a generator and in the absence of solar energy the boat can be powered using the generator.
 
 SWTD is eyeing to tap the potential of MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions or events) tourism, where large groups, usually planned well in advance, are brought together for a purpose.
 
 MICE tourism was on a downward trend in the state in the last few years, mainly due to the liquor ban. “People have opted for other destinations like Sri Lanka and Goa in the last few years,” said Sreekumar, a tour operator in Kumarakom.
 
 However, the relaxations in the liquor policy has brought back scope for MICE tourism.
