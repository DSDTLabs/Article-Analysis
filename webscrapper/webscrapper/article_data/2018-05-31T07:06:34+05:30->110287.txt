HYDERABAD: The   were forced to unblock the Twitter account of activist Vijay   following an outrage. Police blocked him on Twitter as Gopal, who led the campaign against parking fee collection by commercial complexes in violation of rules, was regularly tagging them whenever malls and multiplex theatres in the city violated the law. 

 
 On Wednesday, @hydcitypolice unblocked Gopal and addressed him as 'Dear Citizen' after   took on the police. Gopal told TOI: "On Tuesday, when I tried to tag city police on a parking violation, I realised that it blocked me. I was surprised, and I think they may have blocked me as I have been making too many complaints about parking violations. It was because of my fight against parking irregularities in the city that the state government brought out a policy of free parking. Initially, the city police responded to my tweets and took action. When I realised I was blocked, I tweeted to my followers about this. There was an outrage against the police move, and it was because of their support that cops were forced to unblock me." 
 
 He said that he would continue to complain against the irregularities in collection of parking fee as well as highlight schools and colleges collecting donations.
 
 One Srikanth Raj tweeted to the DGP and minister KTR, "This not fair, unblock the ID immediately." After unblocking, police tweeted, "We regret the inconvenience. We answered ur issues earlier, with all status-updates available with us or which we tracked on behalf of you dear citizen-regarding issues which you reported. We tried our best to address and answer. We appreciate your efforts too."
