KOLKATA:  , arguably the poorest in India as far as their   is concerned, will finally get a hike from this April. The passage of two bills – West Bengal Legislative Assembly (Members’ Emoluments) (Amendment) Bill, 2017, and   (Amendment) Bill, 2017 — has promised a Rs 5,000 raise for each MLA in the state, taking their   to Rs 17,500. 

 The ministers of the state, who earned less than the MLAs, also received a salary hike. A minister-in-charge (MiC) will now get Rs 22,000 per month, while a minister of state (MoS) will get Rs 21,900. The chief minister’s salary has been fixed at Rs 27,001, though Mamata Banerjee does not draw a salary and receives only a token Re 1. The speaker’s salary will be Rs 27,000. 
 
 The daily allowance of ministers has been revised to Rs 2,000.
 
 Congress MLA Nepal Mahato furnished a comparative study of MLAs’ salaries in different states to show how poorly paid Bengal representatives MLAs are. He said MLAs from Telengana, the newest state, earn the highest – Rs 2.5 lakh. “Even MLAs from UP, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Jharkhand earn more than our MLAs.” 
 
 CPM MLA Sujan Chakraborty, however, sounded a discordant note when he said this revision was not desired when former MLAs are discounted from the benefit of the raise. Chakraborty added that if salaries needed to be raised at all, it should be carried out across the spectrum — in Panchayats and municipalities as well. Parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee countered Chakraborty by saying that the latter was thinking of his own future when he too would become a former MLA.
 
 Chatterjee added that during the Left regime, MLAs’ salaries remained poor throughout. 
 
 “In today’s world, it is very difficult to carry out basic activities honestly with such a meagre salary. It should have been much better. But it will improve with the betterment of financial health of state exchequer.”
