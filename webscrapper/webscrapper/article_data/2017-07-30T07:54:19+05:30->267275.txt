HYDERABAD: Goons can no longer set their eyes on the   (TTD) wealth as the TTD is planning to ramp up its security   by installing high-resolution cameras with facial recognition technology. 
 
 The camera system will be fed with data of criminals, and the cameras would instantly recognise offenders like thieves, kidnappers, laddu counterfeiters, liquor smugglers and even terrorists and alert security personnel. 
 
 "We already have data of about 3,000 criminals who committed various offences in the past in Tirumala and Tirupati. We would now approach our state police department and of other states like  , Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra for their list of criminals. We would also contact central security agencies for data on terrorists,"  , TTD chief vigilance and security officer, told STOI.
 
  In another initiative, the darshan queue at the   would have 32 door frame metal detectors (DFMDs) against the exsisting four units that are operating near the maha-dwaram (main-entrance). "Four of the 64 waiting compartments of the Vaikuntam complex will get eight new DFMDs to allow thorough scrutiny of the thousands of pilgrims entering the temple every hour. Eight baggage scanners would also be installed," TTD executive officer   said.
 
  An overhauled command control centre in Tirumala would have a state-of-the-art Video Wall (with TVs streaming CCTV footage).
 
  "With these advancements, we can conduct real-time patrolling of Tirumala. We will also be training our personnel on scrutinising camera footage for detecting crimes. They will alert field staff for quick response and action," the CVSO said.
