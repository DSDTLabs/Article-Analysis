Panaji: Terming the Congress’s public outreach campaign ‘Jana, Gana, Mana, Nomon Tuka Goykara’ a “publicity stunt”, the   on Wednesday said the state government was serious about resolving the mining issue. 

 “The Supreme Court is on vacation. The government will approach the court once its reopens. It is ironic that the Congress Legislature Party has formed a five-member committee that claims it will find a solution to restarting mining operations in Goa, when one of its former CMs is out on bail in the mining scam,” BJP functionary Dattaprasad Naik, said. He also said it was ludicrous for the Congress to set ultimatums for the governor to act on their pleas to appoint a new CM for Goa. “Now they say they will petition the President. These claims are ridiculous. Our CM will complete a full term in office,” he said, adding that the BJP Yuva Morcha will stage motorcycle rallies across Goa to mark four years of the BJP government at the centre. The rallies will be held everyday at 4pm, from June 1 to 6. tnn
