DHANBAD: While at least 23,000 teachers are required across the  , only 2,300 exist to run the show,   Neera Yadav said on Thursday. 

 Expressing her concerns over the teachers' crisis and recruitment processes, she said, "There are few hurdles in the recruitment process and the government is working towards getting rid of them at the earliest."
 
 Yadav said that the state government is serious on educating the female population and a decision has already been taken to open colleges for women in 11 districts. Twelve districts, with a majority of people from the backward classes, have been chosen to open model co-education schools, she added. When asked as to how the government planned to improve the standard of education in government polytechnic colleges, the HRD minister said the education department is looking into the issue.
