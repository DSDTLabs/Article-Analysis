 Senior party functionaries have come forward to accept responsibility after the   was reduced to a single-digit figure in the  .
 
 But Kishor, who famously promised he would get 220 seats for the Congress, has not returned to party headquarters.
 
 After waiting six days since the results were announced, four-time UP Congress Committee secretary Rajesh Singh finally had two “Missing” posters of “PK” put up. The message: Anyone, worker or leader, who finds and brings Prashant Kishor — the self-acclaimed Chanakya — to a Congress workers’ meet will be awarded Rs 5 lakh. Singh’s controversial posters — one outside the UPCC headquarters and another in Hazratganj in Lucknow — went up on March 17 and were pulled down shortly after. Angry Congress workers hung it up again, only for the posters to be brought down again late at night on the instructions of the party office.
 
 When TOI spoke to Rajesh Singh, he said, “From the start,   had us believe he was no less in stature than Rahul Gandhi himself. Over the last few months, Congress workers worked tirelessly, and with complete commitment, because they care for the party and its leaders. This, despite Kishor’s arrogance, and even when his team of 20-somethings questioned our integrity and checked on us. Now, when all his claims have fallen flat, everyone is blaming Rahul Gandhi while PK has conveniently disappeared. My posters echo the sentiments of every worker in the Congress party who genuinely wanted this party to do well.” 
 
 While Singh has since been suspended from the party for 6 years on charges of indiscipline, some senior leaders accept that over-dependence on Prashant Kishor might have hurt the party’s interests and demotivated workers and leaders.
