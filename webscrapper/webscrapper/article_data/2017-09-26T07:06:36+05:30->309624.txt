BENGALURU: Are medicines meant for women in labour being given to cows? That's what health minister KR Ramesh Kumar claimed at the   on Monday, but health department officials told TOI the minister's statement was based on a case filed by the deputy drugs controller, Belagavi in 2010. 

 "Two months ago, a gynaecologist in Hassan said some medicines required for women in labour were not available even after indenting for them. We checked and learnt that the medicines meant for women were given to cows to yield more milk," the minister said at an immunization event in Belagavi.
 
 Drug inspectors had booked the case under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act against a retail   in 2010 in Mangasuli, Belagavi for selling   Veterinary to farmers for milch cows. Oxytocin Veterinary is used to induce labor contractions in cows. Interestingly, Oxytocin is also used for pregnant women to strengthen labour contractions during childbirth, and to control bleeding after childbirth.
 
 The pharmacist had sold the drug without prescriptions and the objective was to get more milk from cows, the deputy drug controller had alleged.
 
 When contacted,  , principal secretary, health and family welfare department, said the medicine mentioned by the minister was not of government supply. "The medicine sold without prescription by a private pharmacist for increasing milk quantity in cows was found during the inspection of the deputy drug controller," she said. 
 
 "In 2014, the wholesale and retail sale of Oxytocin was banned as its misuse by farmers was rampant. The drug manufacturers are supposed to supply it to veterinary medical colleges directly and not to pharmacists. However, when the case was booked against a pharmacist in Mangasuli, the charges were that he sold it without prescriptions and had no data on the sales. Women who consume milk from cows adminstered Oxytocin can develop male characterstics," said  , deputy drug controller.
