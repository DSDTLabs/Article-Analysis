Bathinda: A soldier’s widow has asked the Army to allow her to remain in its quarters at the Bathinda cantonment with her three daughters. Rajinder Kaur, wife of deceased Naik Satnam Singh, has also sought all ex gratia benefits following the demise of her husband.

 Addressing mediapersons, in presence of Punjab Congress general secretary Virpal Kaur Sukhna, Rajinder said, “My husband was coming from Delhi to Pathankot while driving a senior Army officer’s private vehicle on February 5, 2015. The vehicle met with an accident near Mukerian town and her husband died while the officer escaped unhurt. My husband was marked on leave from duty as he was not on official duty due to which I only got the pension and no ex gratia assistance. Now the Army authorities have asked me to vacate the house in the Bathinda cantonment in September. I am unable to look after my three daughters.”
 
 Virpal said they were trying that Satnam be considered ‘on duty’ when he died while driving the vehicle of a senior Army officer so that his widow could get all the benefits admissible to the families of soldiers who die on duty. “We will also approach Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh with the request to impress upon the Army authorities to help the widow.”
