PANAJI: A laterite wall with a fence of steel chain links will be constructed along the perimeter of the   to keep wild animals from entering the area. 

 “Every zoo has to have a perimeter wall. In Goa, we have a small zoo and its surrounding forest is declared a sanctuary. If we don’t fence the area, the movement of animals cannot be restricted,” principal chief conservator of forests  , said. He also said the sanctuary currently has only a cattle-proof trench.
 
 Sources said there have been a few instances of wild animals entering the sanctuary surrounding the zoo, thus creating a sense of fear among the forest officials that they may access the zoo itself.
 
 “Very often, panthers come in during mating season. Even herbivores such as deer wander into the area searching for food,” sources said.
 
 Steel chain links, which have been proposed to be used for the fence instead of chromium-plated iron links, are expected to cost Rs 2-3 crore more, but are touted to be more durable than the latter, a forest official said. “The material is not available in Goa, so a national-level tender may have to be floated for the links,” the official added.
 
 The perimeter wall is part of the master plan to upgrade the zoo. The plan was prepared by the department and sent to the   for approval.
