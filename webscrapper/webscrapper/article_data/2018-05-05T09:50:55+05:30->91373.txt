LUCKNOW: The Congress party moved a petition in UP   on Friday for cancellation of membership of its rebel MLC Dinesh Singh.

 
 MLC from Rae Bareli, Dinesh Pratap Singh had quit Congress and joined   on April 21 in the presence of BJP chief   and CM Yogi Adityanath.
 
 In its petition, Congress has cited relevant sections of anti-defection laws to support the plea to cancel Singh’s membership. Citing section 7 of the UP legislative council (disqualification on the ground of defection) rule read with Article 191(2), 191(2)(1)(a) of the 10th schedule of the Constitution, Congress leader in   ‘Lallu’ said that a public representative who resigns from the party also ends up losing the seat.
 
 “He was a Congress MLC. Since he is no longer a member of the party, he cannot enjoy membership of Vidhan Parishad on Congress symbol,” said Ajay Kumar.
 
 Before joining BJP, Singh, once one of the most trusted Congress lieutenants, had claimed that he was tired of the work culture within the party. He said that the party worked like a private limited company. His younger brother Rakesh Singh is   from Harchandpur.
