After a series of melodious, romantic songs like 'Soch Na Sake', 'Tum Jo Aaye' and 'Wajah Tum Ho', which were lapped up by music patrons,   can now be heard in a completely different kind of groove. She has sung the vibrant '  2.0', an EDM version of 'Gulaabi Aankhen', which is expected to become the party song this year.

  Talking about the track, Tulsi says, “It required a carefree, bindaas attitude in the rendition and I have tried to project that in my tone. 
 I’ve sung it in a rugged, grungy manner. I was literally dancing while recording the song. The song’s production is new-age. It’s a mix of trap and hip-hop, which is huge in the West but had not been explored in Bollywood as much. Composer   has delivered an extremely catchy tune. Kumaar’s lyrics are fantastic too. I’ve tried to do my best to justify the vivacious spirit of the song. I just hope my fans enjoy the song as much as I did while working on it.”
