PUNE: Dressed in vibrant costumes with white-washed faces, two clowns will take centre stage at Kalachhaya Cultural Centre on February 5 to tell a tale of not-so-romantic love.

 Organised by the city-based International Association for Performing Arts and Research ( ), the wordless play, titled ‘Mandragora Circus’, will be staged by Argentina-based artists Mariana   and  .
 
 “The reason we roped Mariana and Juan is because they have extremely different technicalities when it comes to performing. Merging the art of circus into theatre is fabulous,” Prasad Vanarase of IAPAR said.
 
 Through a novel combination of loud expressions, perfected circus stunts and captivating background score, the clowns will weave a story that takes us through the tumultuous story of love. The lack of words in the play will be filled with acrobats, tumbling, jumps and loud expressions that will represent the roller coaster journey that a relationship is.
 
 Silva said, “It (the play) came from the need to tell a story using the circus techniques that we both have been developing since 1998.”
 
 The show premiered in 2003 in Trelew, Argentina. Since then, the nomadic theatre group has performed in more than 42 countries. In India, the duo has performed in Hampi, New Delhi, Mumbai, Kochi and Kollam.
 
 Apart from the play, IAPAR with Silva and Bracamonte will conduct workshops on ‘Introduction to Circus skills’ on February 10 and 11.
