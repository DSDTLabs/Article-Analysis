Vadodara: Nilkesh Desai, who was held on Saturday for cheating three citizens by boasting his connections with mayor Bharat Dangar, was also arrested for forging identity and business cards of a city-based advocate.

 Lawyer Chandrakant Raval had registered case of cheating against Desai in February.
 
 Desai, a resident of Wadi, was arrested for three cases of cheating in 2014 and 2015 for which Raval had bailed him out. During the proceedings, Raval had given his visiting card to Desai. Earlier last year, Raval learnt that Desai had faked his identity card of Bar Council of Gujarat.
 
 When Raval had given his complaint at the police station, police called Desai to give his statement in which he denied the charges. But, his wife told the police that he had showed his identity as a lawyer after which they got married. She also told the police that in connection with a case, Madhya Pradesh police had seized Desai’s car in which the police had found legal documents of several persons, blank cheques and fake identity card of Bar Council of Gujarat.
 
 Cops were directed to take Raval’s complaint by court after he had filed an application when the police refused to register the case.
 
 Desai had conned three aspirants of Mukhyamantri Gruh Yojana on Makarpura by boasting of his connections with Dangar.
