AHMEDABAD: The Smart Party, a political outfit floated by a former IPS officer,  , and his friends in June 2017 is struggling to raise funds. 

 The party had announced that it would contest the December 2017 assembly polls and is searching for candidates. “Funds are crucial when you are planning to contest an election” said a senior party member. In the state, a third front or an alternative to the BJP and the Congress have not fared well. In 1996, Shankersinh Vaghela had formed the Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP) after breaking off with the BJP. Later, Vaghela’s party merged with the Congress.
 
 Keshubhai Patel, a former chief minister of Gujarat, had formed the   Parivartan Party in 2012, which contested the assembly elections that year. However, the party was able to win only two seats. Patel won from Visavadar while Nalin Kotadia won Dhari. In 2014, before the general elections, the GPP merged with the BJP to support Narendra Modi’s prime ministerial candidature.
 
 “Some funds that had been promised are being delayed for one reason or the other,” said a senior Smart Party member. “However, we will contest the forthcoming Gujarat assembly elections.” Party sources said that before kicking off for the search for candidates, the Smart Party needs proper planning for which they need funds. “We are working hard to gather legitimate funds and are hopeful of a positive outcome,” said a member of the Smart Party.
 
 Sharma, a 1992-batch IPS officer who had resigned from the force in February 2015, had said that the party would employ a unique strategy to contest the 2017 assembly polls. Sharma who is a practising lawyer, had said that scrapping of the prohibition policy would help gather revenue which could be used for many welfare schemes. He had said that if his party came to power or acquired the power to influence the government, it would withdraw all cases registered against the Patidar stir leaders.
