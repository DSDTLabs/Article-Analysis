PUNE: The   police on Thursday arrested two sweet gabbers for stealing cash while embracing their targets. With their arrest, the police have solved as many as eight cases and recovered Rs2.5 lakh cash from the duo, who loved to party using the loot.

 The suspects, Manjari resident   alias Katale (24) and Prabhu alias   (20) of Hadapsar, have 12 similar cases registered against them with the Pune city police. In July last year, the Market Yard police had arrested the two men as well as another accomplice.
 
  
  
 
 A probe revealed that after being released on bail, Jagtap and Dhumal had shifted their base in the district and had started targeting people, mainly bank customers, in Shirur, Ranjangaon and Bhigvan. “The two men would give people a warm hug after seeking small favours, such as asking directions to a house, lodge or shop, and steal their cash,” said  , inspector of the local crime branch of Pune Rural police.
 
 Gawade said last year, on November 11, two well-dressed men riding a motorbike approached a Shirur-based trader Kapil Bora seeking help with an address. “While talking to them, the duo pretended they knew Bora very well. One of them hugged Bora and stole Rs40,000 while embracing him,” the officer said. Even before Bora realized that his cash was stolen, the duo had moved on.
 
 Bora had lodged the complaint with the Shirur police. Later, four more thefts that involved a similar modus were reported in Shirur. “While probing these cases, we obtained CCTV footage from various establishments and identified the duo. In the course of collecting information, we realized the men were using the same modus as observed in Pune last year,” Gawade said.
 
 After ascertaining their identity, the police team took the men into custody from Theur phata in Manjari. “Jagtap and Dhumal admitted their involvement in the thefts,” he said.
 
 The police have detected eight cases, including six from Shirur and one each from Ranjangaon and Bhigvan.
