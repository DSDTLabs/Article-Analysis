 "I could not book a movie. I was like; a movie career is not going to happen for me. Movies in the '80s were, they were doing things in the '80s like, what's that one with   and  ? 'Lethal Weapon.' Those were the years, '80s movies were like that."
 
 "So, I was not a '80s movie person. I thought, well, I'm going to have a career in theatre and maybe some television. Suddenly, independent film happened. It was like this whole world opened up. When those three movies came out at the same time, I went from being a TV actress to suddenly being a film actress," Moore, 56, says.
