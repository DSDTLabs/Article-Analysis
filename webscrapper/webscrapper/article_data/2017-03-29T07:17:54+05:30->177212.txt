 Quoting official data, HHF president Mujtaba Hasan Askari said Telangana recorded 11,846 new cases of HIVAIDS during 2016. With this, the total PLHIV population in the state has increased to 1,73,398 (Pre ART2016).“This is an increase of seven per cent in the HIV AIDS cases during 2016 over the previous year (2015). But, if the data prior to 2015 is taken into account, one cannot deduce whether the burden of the disease has increased or decreased as it pertained to undivided state. At an average, 950 to 1,000 new cases of HIVAIDS were reported every month during 2016,“ he said.
 
 Askari said the total HIVAIDS burden in Telangana seemed to be underestimated. “We found discrepancy between the numbers shared by   (TSACS) and the data obtained from ART centres. TSACS officials claimed that the difference could be on account of transfers to ART Link centres or ART Plus centres,“ he said.
 
 The Foundation also conducted a detailed field level survey across the state and submitted the findings to the project director of TSACS. He said the TSACS did not share data on HIV-TB co-infection in the state. Incidentally, the mortality due to TB in HIV cases is very high.
