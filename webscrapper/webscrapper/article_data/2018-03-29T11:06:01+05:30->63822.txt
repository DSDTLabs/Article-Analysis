SANGLI: Shri Shivpratishthan Hindustan chief   on Wednesday said the state government had unnecessarily spent time and money investigating his alleged role in the   violence and that it should have instead probed the Naxal links to the incident. 

 In an exclusive interaction before the rally organised in his support at Sangli, Bhide told TOI that the state government is “unnecessarily spending time and money over investigating the matter in which he had not played any role.”
 
 “It is a waste of time and money. I have other works to do. We have planned to install a golden throne of   (at  ), the work of which will begin soon,” he said.
 
 Sitting alone in his small room in the   area of Sangli, Bhide was busy calling his ‘dharkaris’ (followers). He said he would not attend the rally and neither speak on the issue. 
 
 Asked about his allegation regarding Naxal links to the Koregaon Bhima violence, Bhide made a personal attack on Prakash Ambedkar, leader of the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh. He claimed that the husband of Ambedkar’s sister was a convicted Naxalite. “There is government evidence. His sister is the wife of a convicted Naxalite.”
 
 When asked about Bhide’s claim, Ambedkar told TOI, “No comments. I don’t speak about people with an unsound mind.”
 
 Earlier, Bhide had claimed that the Koregaon Bhima violence was a pre-planned conspiracy. 
 
 Recently, MP and chairman of the Raigad Development Authority Sambhajiraje Bhosale had welcomed Bhide’s resolution to install the golden throne. Bhosale had, however, said that the project should be proposed through the authority. “We will follow the process. Even while buying railway tickets, you have to stand in queue,” said Bhide.
