GANDHINAGAR: There was an uproar in the state assembly and the house had to be adjourned, for four minutes, till the end of question hour, over the alleged scam in the   (GSPC). GSPC spent more than Rs 20,000 crore on the KG basin gas exploration project without starting commercial production in ten years.

 Tejshree Patel, the Congress MLA from Viramgam, following her question on the GSPC KG basin gas exploration project, accused the BJP of carrying out a scam. Deputy CM Nitin Patel, ministers and BJP MLAs vociferously opposed this statement.
 
  had asked when production had begun in the KG basin; what was the value of gas recovered in the last two years; and how much money was spent on the project thus far. 
 
 The written reply by deputy CM Nitin Patel stated: “So far, trial production has been started. No commercial production has been started yet. As on December 31, 2016, a total of Rs 14,738.41 crore has been spent (taking GSPC’s share as 80%).” The government did not specify the interest paid on the sum, which was not included in the figure above.
 
 Tejshree Patel said there had been a huge scam in GSPC, while Nitin Patel retorted that the Congress did not spare land, sky or even funds for soldiers in its corruption. 
 
 In response, leader of opposition   and senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil accused the treasury benches of creating a disturbance in the house to avoid giving details of the GSPC scam.
 
 Vaghela said: “The BJP government tried to avoid Tejshreeben Patel’s question by prolonging the replies by ministers. They did not succeed and had to face questions. The deputy CM and other BJP leaders caused an uproar to avoid answering. Another Congress member, Shaktisinh Gohil, said that the CAG had certified the irregularities in the house and the BJP needs to answer. He said that as the BJP did not want to give an answer, they were forced to protest.”
