GURUGRAM: Residents of   organised a mahapanchayat at 11am on Sunday to demand the release of those youth from their village who have been apprehended for   and vandalism — including setting a Roadways bus on fire and attacking a school bus carrying children — as part of their agitation against the makers of film Padmaavat. 

 On January 24, around 18   from Bhondsi were apprehended by   police, of which two juveniles have been acquitted since then. On Sunday, villager   said, “It’s unfair that instead of catching the hooligans who posed a threat to the villagers as well, cops framed our innocent children.” 
 
 The villagers have been saying the apprehended youth, who were picked up by police, were returning from tuition or sports practice, or were mere spectators to the vandalism. 
 
 “If cops have any evidence against them, they should show it to everyone. They have nothing against our children. Once tainted with a police record, the youths’ future will be spoiled,” said  .
 
 The parents of those apprehended have threatened to start an agitation if the youth are not released. They have decided to meet deputy commissioner   and police commissioner   on Monday, seeking their intervention in the matter. The villagers have already met the chief minister on January 31, but have not received any assurance from him.
 
 “We want an impartial probe in the matter. We seek justice from these officials and hope they will find the actual culprits,” said Bishan Singh.
