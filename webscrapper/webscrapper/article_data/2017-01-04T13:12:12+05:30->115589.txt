NAGPUR: The tall claims of   (NMC) to protect green cover in the city were exposed on Tuesday when huge branches of old trees were felled at   area without any reason.

 The garden department granted permission to contractor   on December 15, to fell big branches of these 60-year-old trees on the boundary of Tilak Nagar ground considering the branches were bending towards electric lines.
 
 However, a visit to the spot found that none of the branches were bending towards electric lines as these lines are exactly opposite where the tall trees are standing.
 
 These trees are good bird habitats and the branches were being chopped when it was time for the avians to return home. A day before TOI had already reported how bird species are dwindling owing to habitat destruction.
 
 This is not the single spot where huge branches were felled. Contractor showed garden department’s permission based on an application by area’s corporator  .
 
 Thakre denied her role in felling huge branches in Tilak Nagar area. “I will inquire into it. I have not sought any such permission to fell branches in Tilak Nagar.” She admitted though that branches were being trimmed near Ambazari road for safety reasons.
 
 NMC officials on the condition of anonymity said permission to fell big tree branches was granted in  , Tilak Nagar, Ambazari, Marar Toli etc on letter issued by corporator Thakre only.
 
 It seems no spot survey was done by NMC garden department before granting permission to fell these branches. But garden department officials deny the charge.
 
 However, after the garden department was informed about it, the felled tree branches weighting 3.5 tonnes were seized and transported to Ambazari garden.
