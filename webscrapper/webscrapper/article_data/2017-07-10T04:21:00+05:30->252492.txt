Nagpur: Chief minister   has not given any concrete assurance over the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) demand to increase the Goods and Services Tax (GST) grant. The BJP-ruled civic body is upset with the   grant citing that it is much less than expectation.

 On Sunday, mayor   along with ruling party leader Sandip Joshi, former mayor Pravin Datke, deputy mayor Deepraj Pardikar, opposition leader Tanaji Wanve and others met Fadnavis and demanded increase in the GST grant.
 
 Fadnavis said the demand was valid but the decision has to be taken for all municipal corporations. “Large-scale developmental works are going on in the city. I will ensure no paucity of funds for the works,” he said.
 
 The state government is yet to finalize GST   of the NMC. The state’s urban development department (UDD) issued a notification on July 4 releasing GST grant for July to 26 municipal corporations, including the NMC. In the notification, NMC is shown to have been granted Rs42.44 crore. 
 
 Principal secretary of urban development department Manisha Mhaiskar told TOI that the grant for Nagpur and Mumbai were yet to be finalized. “Nagpur and Mumbai did not submit audit figures of last five years’ revenue. Grant of these two cities will be finalized after receiving the audit figures,” she said.
 
 The NMC had sought Rs88.63 crore per month (Rs1,063.56 crore per year) as GST grant from the government. The NMC is likely to get much less than expectation.
