NEW DELHI: Are the coaches at the   (NCA) getting picked without consulting its committee members? Sources allege that   chairman   and committee members, including director  , have not been consulted over appointments of coaches and other staff members.

 
 Not consulting Vengsarkar, a cricketer with the experience of more than 100 Test matches, has surprised many board officials. "How can two people pick coaches for zonal academies for age-group camps without consulting Vengsarkar?" a board official asked.
 
 When TOI tried to reach out to Vengsarkar, he was not available for comments.
 
 NCA chairman Niranjan Shah confirmed that a series of appointments have happened with consulting the committee headed by him. "The board has been keeping all other committees informed about its decision except the NCA committee. There is a vendetta against us," Shah said on Saturday.
 
 With Committee of Administrators (CoA) not involved with the appointment of NCA coaches because it isn't a policy decision, a board official said anomalies are happening at the NCA. "At least, an email should go out to the committee members to ensure that the members are aware of all the appointments," the board office-bearer said while adding that board would be conducting a meeting of the NCA committee soon.
 
 A   manager, who didn't wish to be named, denied there was nothing wrong with the appointment of coaches at the NCA. "There isn't any irregularity happening. All the deserving candidates are given due diligence and just because the committee members aren't involved with the running of the NCA, it doesn't mean the candidates picked are bad. The real deal is that the NCA members want to come and attend NCA meetings and that is why they are desperate," the manager said.
