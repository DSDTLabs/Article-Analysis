 villain   is still basking in the excitement of having landed a role in Vijay starrer  . 

 Incidentally, it was a character he did as a fan of Vijay which paved the way for his bagging the role, he says. 'I played the lead in a Tamil movie titled   which is about three hard core fans of Vijay. One day I got a call from Vijay's team asking whether I would be interested in doing a role in Bairavaa. Mine was a positive character in the movie, as a friend of Keerthy Suresh,' he says.
 
  But what got him thrilled was his meeting with Vijay, he says. 'It was my first day at the location and we were shooting a song when I saw Vijay walking in. I automatically stood up but he came and hugged me, asking me to sit. It was a total kili poyi moment for me. 'It is an achievement that a Malayali actor played a fan of an actor like me' he told me. I never expected him to notice my movies,' signs off Roshan.
