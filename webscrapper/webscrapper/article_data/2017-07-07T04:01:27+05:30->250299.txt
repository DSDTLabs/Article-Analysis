GURUGRAM: Residents of   Township in Sector 54 alleged that   firm Suncity Maintenance Pvt. Ltd., has been charging them common area maintenance (CAM) charges, but the developer has cut off all value-added services. Following this, the district town planner (DTP) on Wednesday directed to have an external auditor carry out an audit of maintenance.

 “This office has examined the complaint: ‘Illegal charging of CAM charges by Suncity Maintenance Pvt. Ltd., Sector 54’. It has been decided the issue pertaining to IFMS and CAM charges shall be dealt with after evaluation by external auditor, which shall be appointed by you. Charges will be borne by developer,” states the letter (a copy of which is with TOI) issued by DTP to senior town planner (STP) on Wednesday.
 
 “On June 30, they withdrew all value-added services…   had to arrange alternatives urgently… Surprisingly, Suncity Maintenance Pvt. Ltd. has also sent invoices in their name of CAM charges, which also include water consumption charges,” states a complaint letter written by SRWA to the deputy commissioner’s office.
 
 “The developer also collected interest free maintenance security deposit in lieu of maintaining statutory services. Now some residents were threatened with serious consequences if they fail to pay CAM charges. We fear it’s a threat to life and security of residents, and request authorities to look into the matter,” said Abhay Punia, SRWA.
