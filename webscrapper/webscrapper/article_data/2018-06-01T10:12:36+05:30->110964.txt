NEW DELHI: The   and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is in talks with   to start hawking khadi fabric and ready-made garments, apart from village industry products — such as honey, soaps and shampoo, some of which have already found their way on the marketplace.

 
 The talks are aimed at encashing the recent boom in the sale of khadi products and making them available at doorsteps. Numbers shared with TOI showed that during 2017-18, khadi sales grew nearly 25% to Rs 2,503 crore. This came on the back of a 29% rise in 2015-16 and 33% growth in 2016-17.
 
  
  
 
 While KVIC had started online sales, a tie-up with Amazon is expected to make products much more accessible. Over the last few years, it has expanded sales channels by going beyond its own stores to enter into tie-ups with companies such as Raymond, Arvind Mills and the  , apart from store-in-store arrangements with the likes of Globus. KVIC is also opening Khadi Malls in addition to revamping its existing stores.
 
 Currently, several sellers are registered with Amazon to sell Khadi-branded products such as shampoo and scrubs, but KVIC now wants to directly come on to the platform, realising that the middle class is increasingly relying on online shopping to meet its day-to-day requirements.
 
 “We have held preliminary talks with Amazon and the arrangement should be worked out shortly,” said a KVIC official, who did not wish to be identified. The government agency is, however, not looking at immediate tie-ups with Flipkart or other marketplaces, sources said.
 
 Under the deal with Amazon, KVIC will maintain its own stocks and warehouses.
