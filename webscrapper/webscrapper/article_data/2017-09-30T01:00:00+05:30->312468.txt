Actress   has lashed out at the troll, who ridiculed the attire she had worn at a recent event in  . It all started a few days ago when   uploaded a video of her event on Twitter. Her white anarkali dress was targeted by a troll, who said she must have got it ‘free of cost’. 
The actress hit back soon after, saying, “No ! Unlike others I don’t wear rented clothes! Everything I wear is my own, hence you will see me repeat my clothes often ! #noshame.”
 With celebs being increasingly targeted on social media, BT got in touch with Kavita for her take on the latest incident. She said, “Trolls behave very nasty with celebs. Perhaps, these people have nothing better to do at home; otherwise, why would they pass negative comments on others? So, while I was not angry, I had to tell the hater to shut up and behave.”
 Why did she allude to ‘rented dress’ in her tweet? “Well, it is a common practice. Some celebs don’t like repeating their outfits at public events, and hire it from designers. However, I am a shopaholic and I love buying new dresses everyday. I have a walk-in wardrobe full of clothes and I don’t let go of any opportunity to flaunt them. I can’t comment on how others choose to dress, but I will never wear rented outfits.”
