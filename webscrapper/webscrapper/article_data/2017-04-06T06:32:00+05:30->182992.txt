KOLKATA: Bengal’s network of state highways has become highly fragmented, thanks to the government’s denotification of several stretches to save liquor establishments dotting these thoroughfares. This has put a question mark on the separate existence of the West Bengal Highway Development Corporation Limited (WBHDCL), the agency chief minister   had brought into existence soon after assuming power in 2011.

 Only a few of the 19 state highways have not been denotified at all. In terms of absolute number, only 277.3km of the state’s 4,505km-long   network have been denotified. While that may not seem like much, it has to be remembered that since most state highways have been affected, it has effectively changed the contour of the road network. 
 
 Right after coming to power in 2011, the chief minister brought about WBHDCL, modelled on the   (NHAI), to build new roads and repair existing high-speed corridors for better connectivity. Now, with the fragmentation of the state highways, the grapevine has it that WBHDCL will eventually be merged with the PWD. Incidentally, Indevar Pandey, the principal secretary of PWD, is also the managing director of WBHDCL.
 
 After the denotification, the most important question is, who will be the custodian of these stretches, as far as repair, augmentation and maintenance is concerned. “As of now, PWD is entrusted with the job of repair and maintenance,” said a senior PWD officer. “But since these stretches become urban municipal roads, the respective municipalities may be asked to take care of these stretches in future,” he added.
 
 Now, the only major project to be handled by WBHDCL is the 270km North-South corridor linking the districts of north and south Bengal. A Rs 4,500-crore project with 70% Asian   assistance, the corridor passes through Tribeni-Kalna-Katwa Road, Chanditala-Seakhala-Champadanga Road, Barjora-Durlavpur More (Mejia) Road and  , said an officer.
