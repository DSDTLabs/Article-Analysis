KOHIMA: The poll juggernaut in Nagaland got rolling on Sunday with 109 election teams departing for various polling booths in rugged, distant parts of Mon, Phek and Zunheboto. The election on Tuesday, with about 530 'vulnerable' polling booths, is going to be a tough test for electoral officers. 

 "Out of 2,156 polling booths, 1,100 have been identified as critical and 530 as vulnerable," Nagaland chief electoral officer   said. Only 566 booths have been classified as 'normal' this time.
 
 'Vulnerable' booths are those which face the risk of violence. "Booths where villagers have sought voting for a single candidate or those where two candidates are from the same village have been identified as vulnerable because they could witness clashes," Sinha added. Mokokchung district has the highest number of vulnerable polling stations. Wokha is another district with a large number of vulnerable booths.
 
 With over two-thirds of the polling booths in vulnerable or critical zones, the   is leaving nothing to chance. The chief electoral officer was confident that all systems are in place for free and fair election.
 
 In booths marked 'critical', stringent surveillance has been put in place. In the last election, these booths saw over 75% of the voting. "CCTV surveillance will help check the practice of multiple or proxy voting," Sinha said. He added, "We have provisions to monitor the booths in real time by live-streaming."
 
 More than 250 companies of central armed police forces, mostly of  , have been pressed into service. Apart from that, armed police personnel from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are also helping out.
