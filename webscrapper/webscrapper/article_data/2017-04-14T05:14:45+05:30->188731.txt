NEW DELHI: With Maldives plunging into fresh political uncertainty, foreign secretary   paid on Thursday a “courtesy call” on President   in Male.

 With four opposition parties, including former President Mohamed Nasheed’s   (MDP), joining hands to form a formidable alliance against the government, Yameen’s position has appeared increasingly shaky in the past few weeks. The opposition has accused him of using the cops to harass and intimidate its leaders.
 
 While India did not say anything officially about the meeting, Maldives said in a statement that Yameen expressed “sincere appreciation for the continued support and assistance provided by the Government of India”.
 
 “President also expressed his firm commitment to further elevate existing relations through different avenues of cooperation. In this regard, the President noted that commercial relations between the two countries would further enhance the greater economic cooperation and development,” said the statement.
