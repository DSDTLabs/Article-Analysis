LUCKNOW: Senior   leader   triggered a row on Sunday when he made remarks about Prime Minister  's caste drawing severe criticism from the BJP.

 At a programme organised by traders here, a person while raising concerns related to the business community mentioned that both Modi and BJP chief   also belonged to the same section of the society.
 
 "Tell them to make laws in favour of the community... Amit Shah is from our community, but Modi is a 'Teli'," Agarwal said prompted a strong reaction from some members of the audience who were apparently not pleased at the remarks.
 
 Reacting strongly, UP BJP chief   said, "We condemn the attempt made by SP general secretary and   MP to link the name of the prime minister with a community, and demand that he should tender an apology."
 
 In a statement, Pandey said the prime minister of India does not belong to any particular caste or community and represents all the 125 crore people. "SP indulges in caste politics and wants to create differences in the society for its vested political interests," Pandey claimed.
