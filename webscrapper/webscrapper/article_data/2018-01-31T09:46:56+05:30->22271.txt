The work has been assigned to a consultant and after the report, the tender process will be initiated.

This will empower the civic body to demolish any public or private property to widen the road. RMC commissioner Banccha Nidhi Pani said, “We have proposed underbridge on Kalavad Road and for that we need to demolish some of the private property. Therefore, we have declared this area as line of public street.”
