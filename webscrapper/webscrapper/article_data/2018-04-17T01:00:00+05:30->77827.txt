Have   and   tied the knot or have they not? Well, after many twists in the tale, BT now has it that the two are finally married. The shaadi, a hush-hush ceremony, took place on April 6 in Mumbai.

 Shakti and Neha had kept everyone guessing about their relationship status since June 5, 2014, when they got engaged following a courtship of two years. While many speculated that the two had actually tied the knot and not just got engaged, the couple refuted the buzz vehemently. More rumours surfaced when their  , expected to take place in November 2016, was postponed indefinitely because of demonetisation.
  
 And just when everybody was under the impression that they were going steady, Shakti left to work on some shows in Indonesia, triggering news of more trouble in paradise. Back then too, the actor denied any truth to the buzz. Interestingly, when BT asked him about his marriage plans recently, Shakti said that he and Neha have no immediate plans to tie the knot, as they would rather focus on their careers.
 
 However, the couple seems to have had a change of heart since then. About his wedding, Shakti says, “We had the haldi ceremony in the morning and pheras in the evening. It was a private affair with only our immediate families in attendance. Both of us have been relatively free over the past few months and so, decided to take the plunge. It seemed like the perfect time, as I am planning to take up something soon and will become busy.”
 Remind him about the speculations that they got married two years ago and he says, “I can’t change that because being public figures, we are bound to be judged and speculated upon all the time.”
 
 So, has life changed post marriage? “The feeling is yet to sink in and I don’t feel like a married man yet. Abhi tak kuch samajh nahi aa raha, but it’s a nice feeling.”
 
 The couple plans to head to Norway for their honeymoon.
