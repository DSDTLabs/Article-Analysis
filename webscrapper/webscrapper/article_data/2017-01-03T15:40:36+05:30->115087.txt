Kolkata: When   MP   appears before the CBI on Tuesday, the agency is likely to question him about his suspected involvement in Rose Valley’s operations as the officers claim to have got their hands on photographs proving his presence at a   “delegates’ meeting”.

 “Bandyopadhyay was a member of the parliamentary standing committee on finance when he attended several Rose Valley programmes. He was seen at a delegate’s meeting at   where he addressed Rose Valley agents,” said a CBI officer. During the UPA regime, Bandyoapadhyay was a member of the parliamentary standing committee, headed by former Union minister  .
 
 After the Saradha bust in March 2013, the same standing committee was entrusted with filing a report on Ponzi firms. The following year, the panel also came up with a report on micro-finance institutions where it talked about the dangers of Ponzi firm operations, post-Saradha scam bust. Bandyopadhyay was a member of the panel when the report was tabled in  .
 
 In November last year, he reportedly received a text message from the CBI, seeking his email ID, a move that the Trinamool claimed was part of BJP’s “vendetta politics”. A few days later, Bandyopadhyay received CBI summons in the Rose Valley probe. He sought time from the CBI twice, till the agency turned down his plea to defer the date beyond January 3.
 
 According to sources in CBI, investigators have taken a stock of his assets and foreign tours to trace any Ponzi money. He is likely to face questions regarding a sedan he has been using. Investigators suspect the car was gifted to Bandyopadhyay by someone holding a key position at Rose Valley. The investigators are also looking into his foreign trips to find out if any of those was sponsored by the Ponzi firm.
