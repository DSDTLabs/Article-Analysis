BHOPAL: In yet another initiative to nab impersonators in the exams,   has now made it   at the exam centre.

 The initiative was recently launched with supervisor exam where photographs of 3 lakh candidates were clicked and saved by Vyapam. Impersonation in exams is a major issue, which has prompted Vyapam to adopt several measures. On a few occasions, the impersonators were nabbed at the last stage of recruitment process. Vyapam has been trying to filter such impersonators at the written exam only. However, the biggest issue was to cross-check each candidate. Sources said it was not feasible to do it manually at the exam centre. By clicking the photographs of the candidates, the authorities can easily cross-check it digitally, as the entire data of the candidates is available with the board.
 
 When contacted, Vyapam director Bhaskar Lakshakar said the objective of clicking pictures was to ensure that the impersonators would not escape easily. “This is additional security aspect of exam. Through this we can easily cross-check the candidates,” he said. Sources said the facility will enable Vyapam to carry out verification of candidates in future also, if they appear in another exam, as their data will be intact.
 
 Lakshakar said Vyapam has been putting in place several security initiatives in past two years to nab impersonators. After taking the charge in 2015, Lakshakar has been endeavouring to switch over to digitisation. Since November 2015, Vyapam has stopped conducting off-line (pen-pencil) exam. 
 
 After repeated failure to get a   (PSA) – the post left vacant since the arrest of   kingpin Nitin Mohindra in 2014 – the professional examination board has developed a unique software, ‘Exam Process Automation System (E-PAS)’, to end human interference and check sabotage while processing results.
