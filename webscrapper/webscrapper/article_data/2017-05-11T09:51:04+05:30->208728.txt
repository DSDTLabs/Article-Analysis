KOLKATA: While   was being interrogated by the cops, his   raised voice against rumours that were allegedly being spread to   before the verdict is out. 

 Few know that on Sunday Vikram went to the cemetery where   is buried. Vikram's childhood friends,   and Richi Richardson, had accompanied him there. "Sonika was a very good human being and her death is a big loss for all of us. We went to the cemetery after 4pm. We had a talk with one of the burial ground executives. Vikram had taken lilies and white roses. He broke down completely at Sonika's grave," Roy said.
 
 Their initial plan was to go to Sonika's house from the cemetery. "But by then, the media trial had started in full swing. People made all sorts of allegations without knowing the truth," Roy said. The trio then changed their plans and Vikram had headed back to his Swinhoe Lane residence. 
 
 What has upset Pritam is that some are taking advantage of Vikram's silence. "People are not respecting their true relationship. No one is understanding the loss Vikram has suffered. Vikram and Sonika had been dating from November-end. Vikram has brought Sonika over to my house too. Sonika was known to my wife and other friends. We have seen how both of them cared for each other. Instead of understanding his loss, people are crucifying him. This is gross injustice. I can vouch for the fact that Vikram would never do anything irresponsible which would cause any harm to Sonika," he said.
 
 "There are several evidences showing that they had gone on a holiday early this year. Close friends were privy to it."
