CHARMINAR: An auto stand near   on the busy   road is throwing   haywire even as cops are turning a blind eye to the problem. Haphazard parking by autos is congesting the road leading towards Talagadda, Asifnagar, Karwan and other busy localities and forcing other vehicles to a crawl. 

 "Traffic policemen are busy intercepting only two-wheeler and four-wheeler drivers for violations and are ignoring the rampant violations by auto drivers. No one is checking whether the drivers at this auto stand have proper documents. Even some minors are found driving autos in a careless manner on this route," said Younus, a motorist.
 
 Provocative attitude of the drivers and rough driving has become a bane for motorists on the stretch. In an effort to get a customer, autos often zigzag their way between vehicles and stop in the middle of the road. But despite such violations, auto drivers go scot free.
 
 "If anyone fails to put on a helmet, traffic cops take pictures and hand over a challan. But traffic personnel neglect errant auto drivers at this stand. Even when cops take some action, the auto drivers leave the place for the time being and return later to continue their wayward practices,"' said  , another motorist. 
 
 Exasperated commuters are now wondering whether the traffic police will take action to curb these aerant auto drivers and decongest the Mehdipatnam stretch.
