The makers of the alternative comedy 'Coffee With D', that features  , have reportedly being bearing the brunt of the underworld. It has been a tough ride for them ever since the release of the film’s trailer that triggered a controversy over its story — that narrates the fictitious journey of a journalist interviewing an underworld don. So much so that the movie, scheduled to release earlier this year, was pushed ahead due to inevitable 
circumstances.
 
 Director   says, “The film’s producer   and I started getting threat calls from the underworld ever since the trailer was launched. We’re being threatened to change the dialogue of all the scenes of the character of the underworld don, which they say is in negative light. With the threats intensifying, we had no option but to lodge a police complaint. My belief in the movie has now compelled me to release the uncut (albeit CBFC certified) version irrespective of these threats.
 
 The movie also features  , Dipannita Sharma and   in pivotal roles. 'Coffee With D', produced by Apex Entertainment, releases January 20.
