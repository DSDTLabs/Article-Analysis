KOLKATA: An air controller's split second delay in assessing a situation and giving clear instructions to pilots of three aircraft put passengers of two flights in peril this December.

 The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau ( ) is investigating the “serious incident“ that took place this winter. Pending the report, the controller in question has been shunted out of the air traffic control ( ) tower.
 
 On the morning of December 11, the controller at the tower in Kolkata airport had three aircraft on his hands. An Emirates flight to Dubai and an   flight to Hyderabad were taxiing for take-off from the main runway while a   flight from Singapore was approaching to land at the airport.
 
 A routine affair at that time of the day, the controller asked the Emirates aircraft to line up from Taxiway K and gave it clearance for take-off. The IndiGo flight was asked to queue up and was next in sequence to hit the runway and take off. The SilkAir flight was around 6 nautical miles from touch down and approaching the landing strip at 320 kmph.
 
 For some reason that is cur rently being looked into, the Emirates flight stood at the Madhyamgram end of the runway for one minute and 15 seconds before starting its take-off run. The rapidly approaching SilkAir aircraft was now 2 nautical miles of touchdown.
 
 The SilkAir captain saw the Emirates flight streak over the runway as it steadily descended for landing. Moments later, with less than a minute to touchdown, the pilot suddenly saw the IndiGo flight on the runway as it braced for the take-off run.
 
 With the runway occupied and time running out, the pilot decided to abort landing. He changed direction and began a steep ascent and withdrew the landing gear.
 
 Unknown to what was happening just over it, the IndiGo flight shot across the runway and then took off at 285 kmph. Suddenly , to his horrow, the flight captain saw the Silk Air plane right before it.Sources said for a brief second, the planes were at the same level with barely 0.6 nautical miles separating them.
 
 “The IndiGo aircraft took off and followed the instructions of ATC. The SilkAir aircraft carried out a go-around. This led to a situation of reduction in horizontal separation between the two aircraft,“ the spokesperon of IndiGo said.
 
 SilkAir has provided AAIB with all necessary flight reports to aid the investigation, its spokesperson said.
 
 A senior official at Kolkata airport said the incident could have been avoided had the controller not cleared IndiGo take-off or asked SilkAir to discontinue approach. He, however, felt the SilkAir captain could have informed the ATC when it decided on the missed approach instead of saying it after being given landing clearance. “Perhaps, visibility that dips in winter mornings also played a part,“ he added.
