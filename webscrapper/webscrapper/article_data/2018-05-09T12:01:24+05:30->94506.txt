KOCHI: The prices of chicken increased to Rs140 per kg from last week’s rate of Rs 90 per kg in markets across the city. The price hike has come at a time when the demand is set to increase especially with the wedding season and Ramzan to begin soon. The increase in price was attributed to dwindling supply from farms in   by shop owners.

 “Due to the summer heat, a greater number of chickens die in farms. This has reduced the output from farms. The price hike has led to a decrease in number of buyers andwehavehadto decrease our stock as well,” said P Basheer, a chicken shop owner at   market.
 
 The cold storage prices have also risen in the past week. “The price of chicken is Rs180 per kg whereas last week it was Rs150,” said   S, owner of   cold storage.
 
 Meanwhile, the increase in wholesale rate of chicken has not affected the menu prices of hotels and restaurants in the city. “So far we have not directed the owners of restaurants and hotels to increase the prices even though the prices have increased over the past week. If done so, the business will suffer even more, now that it is summer season,” said  , general secretary of Kerala Hotel & Restaurant Association. Restaurant owners confirmed that the menu prices remain unchanged.
 
 The price hike would bear no effect on meat products and processed meat according to Saji Essow, general manager of  . “We have procured a tender which enables us to buy chicken from farms at a fixed rate for one year. So, the price hike will not affect the prices of products sold at our retail outlets,” he said.
 
 The people buying chicken directly from the market for domestic consumption have been the worst affected. “We used to buy chicken for Rs95 per kg but recently we have stopped buying it as frequently. With the prices rising, it is getting too expensive to buy chicken,” said  , a householder.
