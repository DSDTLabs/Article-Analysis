KOLKATA: An alleged “abduction” and theft case where a 17-year-old student of Class XI of a reputable city school was forced to forgo his brand new costly   on February 14 near   in broad daylight has sent the cops in a tizzy.

 Though police are calling it a case of ‘kepmari’, where the boy’s phone was snatched, the circumstances leading up to the incident have led a section of officers to treat it seriously. “It’s clear that a phone snatching gang has become reckless and carefully choosing their targets in the heart of the city. Hence, there is a need to nab the suspect at the earliest,” said an officer at Lalbazar.
 
 According to the complaint, the victim — who was walking down S N Banerjee Road towards   station from the Free School Street crossing around 2pm — was waylaid, then threatened near Regal Cinemas and then “abducted” for half an hour. The suspect had reportedly forced the victim to follow him before letting him go near the Metro Cinema.
 
 The police on Friday, though, claimed they have identified the suspect — a snatcher from Howrah — and will be arresting him soon. “We have reconstructed the crime scene and found CCTV evidences of the victim handing over his phone to the suspect. However, there was no   at all as claimed by the boy,” said an officer from the central division.
 
 The father of the boy, a resident of Karunamoyee near Tollygunge, alleged: “My son was walking down S N Banerjee Road from   towards Esplanade Metro station to catch a train. Barely 100 metres from the New Market PS, he was accosted by the suspect, who misled him by intimidation and threat, took away his handset and made my son follow him for a kilometre to a spot on Madan Street. Here, my son was threatened and told to leave.”
