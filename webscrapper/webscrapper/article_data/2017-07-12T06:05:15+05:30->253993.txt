New Delhi: A   is not expected to   control over his vehicle even if another driver is not driving properly, a tribunal   has said while awarding Rs 19.60 lakh compensation to the widow, minor children and parents of a vegetable seller who died in a road accident.

 The victim,  , was accused of driving his rickshaw-cart on the wrong side. The tribunal also pointed out that Jugendra’s rickshaw-cart was on the extreme right side of the road, whereas the car which hit it had considerable road width available for driving his vehicle. 
 
 Jugendra, 28, died of head injuries on October 28, 2016 when a car rammed him. The erring driver, however, contended that the deceased was driving his cart on the wrong side of the road and it was the victim who hit the car. The insurance company with which the car was insured asserted that the accident took place due to the vegetable seller’s negligence.
 
 “Even if it is accepted, for the sake of arguments, that the deceased was moving with his rickshaw-cart on the wrong direction of the road, it cannot be brushed aside that rickshaw-cart is a slow moving vehicle...,” said the motor accident claims tribunal (MACT) presiding officer Sanjay Sharma.
