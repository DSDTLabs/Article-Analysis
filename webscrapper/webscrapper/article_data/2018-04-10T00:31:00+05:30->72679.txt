Trichy: The absence of officials to distribute nomination forms at cooperative societies in Manapparai in Trichy and Karambakudi in Pudukkottai led to protests by DMK and AMMK on Monday. 

 The primary agriculture cooperative credit societies (PACCS) at Muthappudaiyanpatti, Mondipatti and Pudhupatti in Manapparai in the district were to issue the forms on Monday for the third phase of the cooperative societies election which will be held on April 16. 
 
 As the officials failed to turn up, functionaries of DMK, MDMK and VCK protested by submitting the nominations to a calf to register their disapproval at Muthappudaiyanpatti. In Pudhupatti, they handed over the nomination to an effigy of the officer. 
 
 In Andhanallur, DMK candidates and their supporters locked the PACCS office as the officials were not present. 
 
 In Pudukkottai, opposition party cadres staged a road blockage as officials were absent at the PACCS in Mullankurichi and LD bank in Karambakudi.
 
 Since the nomination process commenced in March 26 for the election on April 2, there were a series of allegations against AIADMK for attempting to capture the entire posts across the state including the districts in Trichy region. 
 
 In Trichy, 608 cooperative societies will elect board of directors this year. This includes cooperative societies of milk, industries, handlooms, khadi, fisheries, social welfare, engineering, silk development, social welfare and noon meal department. The elections were planned in four phases on April 2, 7, 16 and 23.
