LActor   and model   have reignited their relationship rumours after the two were spotted having a romantic outing.

  
  
 According to reports, the pair headed out for a breakfast date together on Wednesday at Gasso restaurant in  , California.
 DiCaprio and Morrone opted for a casual look during the outing, with the former donning a navy blue zip-up hoodie, dark wash jeans and white sneakers. The actor completed his look with a Dodgers baseball cap and a pair of sunglasses. 
 
 Meanwhile, Morrone rocked a white t-shirt which she teamed with loose-fitting grey ripped jeans and a large tan hat. During the outing, the model was seen linking arms with the Oscar-winning actor and even sweetly kissing him on his shoulder as they walked to their car.
