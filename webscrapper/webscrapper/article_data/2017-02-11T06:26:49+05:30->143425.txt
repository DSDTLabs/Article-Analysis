As part of the   English Teaching Assistantship ( ) that aims to strengthen   abilities of middle  , six teaching assistants from the US have been working toward   of students in the state since July last year. 

 The program, under United States India Educational Foundation, placed 19 American graduates as ETAs in schools across different states. While the program was introduced to Chennai in 2013-14, this year is the first time where the program has branched out to Kanchipuram and Puducherry.
 
 The teaching assistants, who will be here till March, shared their experiences at a press meet at the US Consulate on Friday. Stephen Gay, one of the assistants, said they hope to inspire students to think about the language that will help facilitate understanding the texts better.
 
 Grace Oxley, another teaching assistant, during her classes grouped proficient students with those not so proficient in English to encourage peer learning. "When you tell children that everyone needs to talk and converse with each other for the entire team to be graded well, they ensure that all team members put in an effort," she said.
