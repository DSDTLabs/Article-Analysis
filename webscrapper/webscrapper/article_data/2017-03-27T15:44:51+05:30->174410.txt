 Ever since Arunabh Kumar, CEO of The Viral Fever was accused of molesting women, many celebrities have spoken out against the evil that hounds all workplaces - harassment at work.
 
 Sonakshi too put out a word out in her conversation with a leading daily. Sonakshi expressed that most women choose to keep shut in order to not face repercussions or death stares at work place. The 29-year-old also felt that women are till date blamed for whatever goes wrong with them and to their dismay they get no aid or support from fellow female colleagues.
 
 Sonakshi further expounded how government must support women and empower them so that they can stand up for themselves.
