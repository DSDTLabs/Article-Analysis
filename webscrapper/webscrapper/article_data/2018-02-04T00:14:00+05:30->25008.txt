Madurai: As part of zonal level anti-corruption drive, Madurai railway division here has commenced a special drive on vigilance from February 1 onwards. Teams of officers from commercial and RPF (Railway Protection Force) are conducting this special drive across the division. As part of the drive, inspections are being conducted at all mass contact areas of railway premises including parking facilities provided at the stations, booking offices, reservation offices, parcel offices, food plazas, vegetarian refreshment rooms, non-vegetarian refreshment rooms, catering/stalls at the stations, reserved coaches and pantry cars on trains. Officers and supervisors are deputed for conducting inspections at these public interface points of railways. This pro-active joint check is aimed at reaching out to the travelling public.  Divisional railway manager, Neenu Ittyerah said that they are also campaigning to popularise the newly introduced vigilance helpline number 155210 during this drive. The helpline will be functional round-the-clock, through which passengers/ customers can inform the railway vigilance department on instances like the demand of a tip/bribe/extra money for offering any services on railway premises.  An e-mail address is also introduced to contact the vigilance department, Southern Railway in case of complaints by the travelling public. They can also email their complaints to vigcomplaints@sr.railnet.gov.in. “We request passengers to communicate any corruption in railways to divisional authorities. The vigilance helpline is displayed in all stations. Public can contact the helpline number to report the corruption, and we will take action against the complaints,” DRM said.
