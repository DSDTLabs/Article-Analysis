   president Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that he was against the the Nanar refinery project as it would destroy the environment in Konkan. 

 "If people of   want the project here, then we will support the demand. A suitable spot should be found," he further said environmentally damaging projects like Enron power plant and Jaitapur nuclear plant were being forcibly set up in Konkan.
 
 Backing locals in Konkan when protests erupted over the refiner project, Uddhav had said that the unit should be shifted to Vidarbha.
 
 Chief minister   is at loggerheads with   leaders over the proposed crude oil refinery, and till date has shown no inclination to change the location. He even ticked off industries minister Subhash Desai publicly for unilaterally announcing in front of Nanar residents in Uddhav's presence that he had cancelled the notification for land acquisition for the proposed refinery. Uddhav questioned the credibility of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and demanded a mechanism be evolved whereby the voter can be sure his vote has gone to the party he voted for. Uddhav said he supported all persons who wanted EVM to be either scrapped or made more credible. The Sena leader was in Nagpur after a gap of three years to review his party's performance in the ten parliamentary constituencies of Vidarbha.
 
 On   parliamentary bypolls, Uddhav said he would take a decision in coming two to three days. "It will depend on what stand other parties take in Palghar. We want all parties to support Shriniwas, son of late Chintaman Vanga. We are supporting the sons and daughters of deceased leaders everywhere. So we expect reciprocation," he added.
 
 Asked about huge backlog of Vidarbha, Uddhav said this question should be asked to finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar and Fadnavis.
