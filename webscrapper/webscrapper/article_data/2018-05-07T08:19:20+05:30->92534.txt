PATNA: A large number of books of Bihar Text Book Publishing Corporation (BTBPC) meant for free supply amid students in government schools were seized from   printing press at Kachwaha Road under the Gopalpur police station area in Patna district on Saturday night. The press was not authorized to print these books.

 Sampatchak block development officer (BDO) Kunj Bihari Singh said the books were meant for supply under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan to the students from Class I and above. Several printers across the state were awarded tenders for that, but not the Sunaina printing press.
 
 Gopalpur police station SHO   said the printing press with the materials and equipment were sealed in the presence of the BDO and Punpun circle inspector Yogesh Chandra. “The seized printed materials were in huge quantity and could not be moved. That’s why we sealed the press,”   said.
 
 He said an FIR on the written complaint of Rashid Hussain was lodged against the press’s proprietor Balaji. “Rashid owns Heva Printing Press. He found the books meant for supply to BTBPC being sold in open market on Khazanchi Road,” the SHO said.
 
 He said along with Rashid,   Agarwal of Miscellaneous Printing Press,   of Patna Offset Press and Sudhir Prakash of New Ratan Priya Printing Press had also approached the police.
 
 The matter surfaced after Vijay and Sudhir, who were given the tender, found the books available in open market though they were yet to start printing these books, the SHO said. He said Hussain and Shailesh had secured tender to print mathematics book for Class III and Hindi books for Class II respectively. “In addition, several seized books at the press were printed in the name of Patna Offset Press,” the SHO said, adding all suspects fled from the back door after raid.
