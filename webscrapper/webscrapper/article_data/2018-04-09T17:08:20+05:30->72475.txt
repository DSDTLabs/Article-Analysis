 said she has faced anxiety troubles while growing up.

  
  
 The 24-year-old   said smaller things being out of place often trigger a sense of unsettlement in her, as trivial as seeing her apartment in a "mess". "I wasn't an anxious child at all, but as I've got older, I've felt more anxiety moving into my life. Usually the little things I get anxious about are indicative of a bigger thing."
 
 "For me, making a decision that's going to affect something in the future is overwhelming. Or I can be fine for a long, long time, and then I'll walk into my apartment and then (panic) that things are a mess," Fanning told .
