KOLHAPUR: Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) Hospital, run by the state government, has been included in the National Cancer Grid (NCG) established by the Tata Memorial Hospital. 

 The NCG is linked to 104 hospitals across the country to help treat cancer patients. The   is attached with   (RCSM) that will be an added advantage to develop trained taskforce.
 
 In the initial phase, the staff will be trained for surgical and chemical treatment of cancer and in later phases, with the availability of machineries, radiation therapy will begin. At present, around 300 cancer patients are treated at CPR every year.
 
 D  , dean of CPR Hospital, said, "The inclusion of CPR in NCG will help patients from the region. Also, the doctors will get advanced training from Tata Memorial Hospital. The centre is attempting to decentralise cancer treatment facilities as it is overburdened with thousands of patients. The centre prefers hospitals attached with colleges and the CPR was on their mind. We are going to select a team of surgeons which will undergo training at the Centre located in Mumbai and the centre will refer the patients from the region to CPR henceforth."
 
 The patients from the region go to hospitals located in Pune and Mumbai for cancer treatment. The radiation therapy requires costly machineries and infrastructure which local facilities cannot afford. Currently, the patients from the region have to wait for at least two months for undergoing radiation therapy at the hospitals based in Pune and Mumbai. The CPR administration is planning to start centres for radiation therapy at Shendapark. The   Cancer Centre, run by private doctors, is also listed in the NCG.
 
 "In future, we are planning to set up high speed Wi-Fi facility at the hospital. The facility will be helpful in telemedicine. Several workshops organised by the Centre will be telecasted to our doctors," said Ramanand.
