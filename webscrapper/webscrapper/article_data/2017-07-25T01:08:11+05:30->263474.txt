NAVI MUMBAI:   node, which is being developed around the proposed international airport, has been facing massive infrastructure problems in almost all the sectors. 

 Water-logged roads surfaced with potholes, broken sewage pipes and storm water drainage system are a common sight and have been affecting the   badly. 
 
 Cidco officials say the infrastructure development has not been at par with how things have progressed in other parts of the city.
 
 “The node has been facing intense infrastructure woes and the residents are facing the odds due to poor infrastructure development in the node. An entire stretch of a road in sector 3 has been water-logged and even the roads leading to the housing societies are in a bad shape,”  , a local resident said.
 
 The storm water drainage system has been broken and choked in sector 5, leading to water logging on the road and the stretch was not repaired even ahead of the monsoon, residents said. Sewage water has been reportedly flooding a spot in sector 19 where a MSEDCL distribution box has been installed.
 
 Another resident Pradip Chinta said, “The civic authorities have ignored the infrastructural work. The housing societies have been developed without basic infrastructure facilities.”
 
 Cidco Ulwe node superintending engineer   said, “Corrective measures are being taken. The contracts for various works have been awarded. The transition period has been a difficult time for the residents.”
