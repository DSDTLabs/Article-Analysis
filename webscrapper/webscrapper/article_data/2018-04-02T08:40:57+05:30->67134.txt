RANCHI:   on Saturday placed three persons under arrest and sent nine students to a   in connection with the  . On Friday, eight of these suspects were detained by police. While two of those arrested, Satish Pandey and Pankaj Singh, are owners of Study Vision, a coaching centre at Chatra, the third accused, Hamesh, teaches at the institute. Of the nine students, seven are from Chatra while two were brought from Patna for investigations. 

  Chatra SP Akhilesh B Variar said the leaked paper reached Study Vision through the two students in Patna. "However, we are not sure where these students got the question papers from. We are questioning the students to establish national links, if any. No links with Delhi have been established yet," Variar added. 
 
  Jharkhand police detained the Patna students on Friday after their counterparts in Chatra pointed the needle of suspicion towards them. Police said the leaked questions were circulated on WhatsApp as hand-written notes on March 27, a day before the mathematics exam. The questions, and their answers, were in exact sequence as that in the paper. While police sources initially said Pandey was linked to ABVP, Yagywalkya Shukla, organising secretary of   in Jharkhand, denied the charges. 
 
  Shukla told TOI Satish Pandey is neither a district office bearer nor a member of ABVP. "He held the position of district coordinator of ABVP for Chatra before the students' union elections held across the state in December 2017, but was later removed from the organisation. Only students can be office bearers in ABVP and Pandey was not enrolled in any course and his membership was therefore void," he said.
