Gurgaon:   of Sector 56’s   demanded removal of   from the society after bouncers allegedly attacked two residents on Wednesday in the society.

 According to the residents, bouncers are being used by the security agency to threaten them on several occasions. Talking about Wednesday’s incident, Sudha Srivastava, a resident of Kendriya Vihar said, “It is not the first time that bouncers have been called by the security agency. Yesterday, there was a quarrel between two groups of residents and one group employed bouncers to beat the other group. “Security guards and bouncers can easily be bribed and be used against the residents. They often pass lewd comments at women. We demand immediate removal of bouncers,” said a resident and a mother of two, requesting anonymity.
 
 Residents in other societies also called it an unhealthy trend. “It has become a habit to hire bouncers to show muscle power. As confrontations between the RWA, developer and residents rise, many agencies hire bouncers to show muscle power to the residents,” said RS Rathee, President of Gurgaon Citizens’ Council, a citizen platform.
