NOIDA: Twenty-nine school transport   or their drivers have been fined during the transport department’s drive carried out last week to check for the non-compliance of the Supreme Court guidelines for school buses.

 Some 21 buses/minibuses have been issued challans for being unfit while two private vans were issued challans for ferrying school children even as the vehicles were not registered as commercial school transport vehicles. Further, six autos/Eeco/Maruti vans have been issued challans for ferrying school children illegally.
 
 Assistant regional transport officer (enforcement) Gyan Mohan told TOI that the department officials have checked school buses/vans belonging to as many as 60 Noida schools during the drive started by the transport department on April 27 in the aftermath of the Kushinagar accident. During the first week of the drive, some 60 buses from Noida schools were checked, of which around 30 buses were found non-compliant with the SC guidelines for school buses like the presence of fire extinguishers, CCTV cameras and proper documentation of the drivers and conductors.
 
 These include buses from schools like Mayoor School, Modern Public School, City Public School, Bal Bharati Public School, Lotus Valley International School, Ramagya School, etc. Officials found that while there are 1,694   belonging to the district’s 425 schools registered with the department, not all the vehicles are being used in the transportation of children. “A total of 1,432 school buses which have been registered and are being used for transportation while there are around 237 (seven-eight seater) vans being used for transporting school children,” ARTO Gyan Mohan said.
