Trichy: The ongoing stir by transport corporation employees has brought down the price as well as the sale of vegetables at the Gandhi Market here.  With the stir by TNSTC employees entering sixth day on Tuesday, small time vendors purchasing vegetables in bulk could not make it to the Gandhi Market, traders said, adding that sales of vegetables have plunged at least by 50 per cent and so have the prices. Even as the officials claim that 80-90 per cent of the fleets are being operated, the number of fleets at five depots of TNSTC in Trichy do not match the claims as most of the buses operated by part-time drivers return to depots after 6 pm.
