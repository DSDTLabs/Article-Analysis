RAJKOT: In a tragic incident, three small siblings were charred to death when their hut caught fire in Gigasan village of Amreli district’s Dhari taluka on Wednesday night. 

 Preliminary investigation suggested that a spark from the earthen cooking stove could have sparked the blaze. The children -   (6 years), her younger sister Daya (4 years) and two-year-old brother Sailesh -- who were sleeping inside were charred in the blaze. 
 
 Their parents   and his wife Sajan had gone to water the wheat field near-by when the incident happened. They saw the hut on fire and even called other locals by raising an alarm, but it was too late. The makeshift hut was made of jute and thick dry grass bundles that resulted in the fire spreading very quickly. 
 
 Atul and his wife, who are natives of near-by Malsika village, had come to Gigasan four months ago and taken the farm of   to sow on lease. As the electricity is supplied at night for agriculture, the couple started the motor and started watering the fields at around 1.30am. Their eldest daughter lives with Atul’s parents in Malsika. “It looks like they forgot to extinguish the hearth after cooking meals at night. A spark from the burning wood might have resulted in the fire,” said investigating officer KM Dabhi of  .
