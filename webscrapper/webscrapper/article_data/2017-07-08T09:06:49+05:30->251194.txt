CHENNAI:   of the   struck work on Friday protesting the local body’s proposal to expand privatisation of   to cover more than 70% of the city.

 More than 300 permanent and temporary conservancy workers attached with the CITU-affiliated   participated in the demonstration near the Chepauk state guest house. The primary concern of the striking workers was that privatisation would reduce their wages and could even render them jobless.
 
 At present, a conservancy worker is paid a daily wage of Rs 295 under the central government sponsored Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana. Protesting workers alleged that they never never receive the amount in full, as they are “forced to pay cuts” by supervisors. Even otherwise, the current wage structure is too thin to sustain a family, said A Mariappan, who has been a conservancy worker for seven years. “If garbage collection is privatised, we could lose the (present) wage too,” he said.
 
 The fear stems partially from the fact that once the corporation implements the proposal, the private contractor would take over the wage burden from the local body. Former CPI (M) MLA, A Soundararajan, said private conservancy operators cannot boast a clean record. “Since when conservancy was privatised, there have been problems and scams. They only look to make money,” he said.
 
 P Srinivasulu, general secretary, Red Flag Union, said conservancy workers wouldn’t hesitate to call an indefinite strike by end of July, in case their demands are not met.
 
 Corporation officials brushed off the protest. “It is just a union attempting to flex its muscles,” said an official. Highlighting that the proposed move is different to the deal signed with Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited, as the contractor will not be paid per tonnage of waste removed but based on performance. Officials said they will soon hold a second round of public consultation to discuss landfill remediation project.
