KOLKATA: Mousumi Bhattacharjee has won a  , in which the   directed an insurance company to consider her husband’s death from malaria an accident and pay up. The insurance firm has complied with the order. But Bhattacharjee’s ordeal is far from over.

 On Monday, TOI tracked down the woman’s flat at Daspara in Kaikhali and found that the insurance company has indeed paid a sum of Rs 11.5 lakh to the bank, but the bank has allegedly refused to return the property documents mortgaged with it, seeking another 2.5 lakh from Bhattacharjee.
 
 “I have won the case, but only on paper. I still don’t have my property documents. The bank is asking for Rs 2.5 lakh as interest for the last four years. I don’t know when my ordeal will finally be over,” said Bhattacharjee on Monday evening over phone from her brother’s house in Siliguri.
 
 Bhattacharjee recalls she had spent several hours making rounds of the bank and the insurance office to get the claim. “On days, I would have to wait for three to four hours at the insurance office and on other days, they would simply ask me to go and come several weeks later saying that the person concerned was not in office. However, I could see him in the next cabin,” she said.
 
 She said that after her husband’s death, she has to rely solely on her brother for their daily expenses. Her son Swagat is a   at  . 
 
 “My husband left behind a meagre amount, with which I can barely afford my son’s college fees. I have to depend on my brother for running our family. How can I pay Rs 2 lakh now? The bank should immediately release my property documents,” she said.
 
 Bhattacharjee’s lawyer   said they have already asked the bank to return the documents based on the commission’s order, but the bank has allegedly refused. “I will write to the commission alleging that the order was not executed completely. It’s a violation of the commission,” Chakraborty said.
 
 TOI could not speak to the bank authorities for a clarification from their end.
