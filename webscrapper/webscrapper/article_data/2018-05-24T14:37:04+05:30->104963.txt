COIMBATORE: Union minister Pon   has called for a detailed probe into the violence at   during the anti-Sterlite protests and the police shooting.

 BJP was the first to oppose the Sterlite plant at the proposal stage itself, the BJP leader told reporters here on Wednesday. “Back then, there was no public support when I opposed the plant and observed a hunger strike. DMK and other parties supported the plant at that time and now they are staging a drama by opposing it,” he said.
 
 “The parties that brought the plant here should be blamed for the police shootout,” Radhakrishnan said, adding that if public had supported BJP when it was protesting against the plant, such a situation would not have come.
 
 When asked about the advanced weapons used by police for shooting the protesters, Radhakrishnan said that he was not aware of the details. “A detailed probe should be ordered to bring out all the facts to light,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP state president   said it was the failure of the state intelligence machinery that resulted in the death of 11 people. “It is a complete failure of the state intelligence machinery. They failed to anticipate violence and take measures to prevent it,” she said and demanded that outfits that instigate people into violent protests should be identified and controlled. 
 
 “Otherwise, such violent protests will happen across the state,” she added.
