CHENNAI: Investigators of the Rajasthan police anti-terror squad on Thursday took terror suspect Mohamed   to the Big Mosque in Triplicane and to Mannnady in connection with the probe of his reported funding of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ) militant group.

 Mohammed Iqbal, 32, of Mylapore, who police arrested on charges of collecting and transferring funds to ISIS through Mumbai-based Jameel Ahmed is currently in custody at the Kotturpuram police station.
 
 An officer said an armed escort took Iqbal, with his face covered, to various spots in the city where investigators believe he carried out illegal activities and met his accomplices while living a double life as a salesman of used laptops and cellphones.
 
 A joint team of the Rajasthan police anti-terror squad and Tamil Nadu police are probing his links to ISIS. Police arrested Iqbal after Jameel Ahmed, his contact in Mumbai, gave him up to investigators.
 
 Police are searching for three businessmen in the city who acted as Iqbal’s accomplices and were part of a   module of ISIS sympathisers and agents. Investigators are also looking for four college students in the city who they suspect were Iqbal’s associates. Iqbal himself is in solitary confinement, with Rajasthan police officers guarding him round the clock.
 
 “Based on Iqbal’s admission that at least 14 men were involved in the Chennai module, we are taking him around the city to arrest other members,” an investigating officer said. “Iqbal was making plans to fly to Syria to fight for ISIS.”
 
 He said Iqbal reported to Abu Saad al Sudani, who acted as his handler, and was looking to radicalise young men with a “call to jihad”.
