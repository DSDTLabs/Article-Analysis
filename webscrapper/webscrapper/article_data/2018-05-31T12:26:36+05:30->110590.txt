Kaalbaishakhi is set to keep a date with Kolkata all year. This forecast hasn’t come from the Meteorological office, but singer-songwriter  . The popular musician is not only working on a love ballad — Kaalbaishakhi — but will also bring a total of 12 songs that have nothing to do with films.
Anupam is collaborating with SVF Music for the dozen songs, the shoot for one of which has already begun. “Work on the songs started around six months back. I am a regular composer and my film songs are well appreciated. Even then, there’s always the need to do music for music — songs that have nothing to do with films,” said the composer, who began shooting the music video for Kaalbaishakhi from May 28. The music video is directed by  .
 
 Talking about the need to explore the indie music space,   said, “Music portals are increasingly becoming more important and I feel this can stop piracy as most listen to songs on paying a minimum amount for subscription. Also, a song can reach out to the listeners the world over. So, my audience in New Jersey or Austria or anywhere else in the world will be able to listen to my song at the same time. Each song will be accompanied by a music video as visual appeal today has become very important.”
 
 About the changing soundscape of Bengal, Anupam reflected, “In the ’90s, no one was listening to film songs and the focus shifted to band music. Nowadays, no one buys albums. So, change is a constant. I wanted to make the most of the digital stores to capture my listeners.” The lyrics of Kaalbaishakhi go like: Kal kal kal baishakhi ashuk/ amar aji baishakhi ashuk and the composer, who is looking forward to the Friday release  , smiled and said, “The song talks about my desperation for a girl.”
