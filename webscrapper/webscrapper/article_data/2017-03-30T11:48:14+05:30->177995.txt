AGARTALA: The Tripura high court on Wednesday banned the use of   with foreign-made kit in the state after a couple filed a petition, claiming to be the holder of a patent to the technology for battery-operated e-rickshaws in India. 

 The ban came after two days of long hearings on the petition filed by Lipika Das (Sinha) and her husband Kanishka Sinha. The high court has asked the state government to take appropriate steps to enforce the ban. 
 
 Most e-rickshaws do not have certification of compliance with prescribed safety norms, have not been registered and do not follow the stipulations under the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2015, the high court said. 
 
 The joint transport commissioner (JTC) has been asked to crack down on unregistered and illegal e-rickshaws. The JTC has been asked to form a committee to stop illegally imported and installed Chinese electric autorickshaw kits. The court also asked the JTC to ensure compliance of all vehicles with the rules in the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act.
 
 Besides the capital, all urban and semi-urban pockets of the state have been flooded with e-rickshaws driven by   over the past two years. Despite repeated appeals, the state government has not taken any stringent measure against them.
 
 AMC officials, however, argued that a large number of owners and drivers of such vehicles with illegally installed electric batteries and kits have been issued licenses and permits. Congress legislator Ratan Lal Nath said even that is an illegal process. "The Left Front-backed trade union CITU has been illegally issuing chits in the name of permits," he said.
