RAJKOT: The   will pad up for their first match of the season against   on Friday, It is the ultimate cocktail that   has offer for which Rajkot is seemingly being decked up. In the middle of all this, there's  , the seasoned Delhi cricketer, who clearly looks like he talks faster than he thinks but actually doesn't, who's putting his experience to work here.

 Having won two IPL titles for KKR, he's been there and done that.
 
 Gambhir knows what's at stake here. It's the quality of cricket that the Lions can come up with that Gambhir is focusing on.
 
 "They're a good team," says Gambhir and he would know a thing or two, having lost both the league matches to the Lions last season.
 
 If the Knights have to begin this tournament on a winning note, they'll have to get their bowling attack in order from the word go.
 
 Umesh Yadav, the Vidarbha pacer who bowled impressively in the fourth Test against Australia, will not be around for KKR's opening game recovering as he is from a lower back injury.
 
 Andre Russell, KKR's West Indian allrounder, isn't around either, facing a one-year ban because of a doping violation.
 
 These are factors playing on Gambhir's mind. He has hopes from the likes of   and Ankit Rajpoot, even as he expects Robin Uthappa Â­ with who he's formed a formidable opening pair, Yusuf Pathan and Manish Pandey to come to the party.
 
 Knights know well that if they've got openers of a certain pedigree, the Lions have the same, with added muscle too, in Brendon McCullum and Dwayne Smith.
 
 "It's the team effort that matters. That's what has helped us season after season," says Gambhir. The KKR captain feels that young chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav should be protected from all the spotlight. "We should not talk about Kuldeep a lot. He should be left alone to hone his skills. We are not going to put too much pressure on him as we have other bowlers who can take that pressure."
