MUMBAI: Tiny tots from Sunflower   School, Malabar Hill, are using art for a cause. Through a three-day exhibition that began Friday and displays its children’s works, the school is raising funds for flood   in Assam.

 The exhibition by children aged two to four years is under way at the Nine Fish Art Gallery in Byculla.
 
 “The theme of the exhibition, focusing on the ‘Earth as our Home’, is significant in today’s age of climate change,” school principal Aruna Thakkar said. “The children learn about these concepts and the environment through innovative teaching methods involving art and a number of excursions throughout the city, from art galleries to the zoo.”
 
 The show has 80 items of children’s art, ranging from drawings to collages, using a wide variety of materials and techniques. “The breadth of their learning is expressed through their work on a mural akin to the one by Brinda Miller at Lion Gate as well as their representations of horses similar to M F Husain’s famous painting,” Thakkar said. 
 
 The exhibition saw 60 families on the first day. All of the children’s work is up for auction, with the proceeds going to   relief worj in Assam.
