BHUBANESWAR: It has been a double whammy for   in the state. Already reeling under demonetisation, the outbreak of   has added to the woes of poultry farmers and businessmen. They claimed the sale of   has dropped by 60 to 70 % in the peak season while the prices have also fallen by Rs 20 a kg. Cashing in on the crisis, mutton and fish vendors have raised prices. 

 People have shunned chicken and eggs. "Though we are aware that bird flu does not infect humans easily, but why to take risk?" said Lipsa Priyadarshini, a collegegoer. 
 
 "Situation is really grim. Winter is the season when we do the maximum business. The sale is very low for the last one month and we don't have money even to buy feed for the chicken. If the situation continues like this we don't have any option but to let them die without food," said Sk Karim, a poultry trader in Unit-IV market here. 
 
 Market sources said the price of chicken has reduced from Rs 140 to Rs 120 a kg in a month. Similarly the price of eggs per dozen has reduced from Rs 55 to Rs 50. "Eggs are highly perishable items and we cannot store them for long, which is leading to huge loss," said Jitendra Pradhan, a chicken and egg seller at Patia.
 
 The poultry traders said hotels, restaurants and fast food centres have also reduced their intake as public consumption has gone down. People are not preferring to take chicken following the outbreak of bird flu. They are not convinced that the disease won't spread by eating well-cooked meat. "We cannot force them. It has affected the overall business of the restaurants as a large number of customers order chicken items," said Aditya Samantray, a restaurant owner in the city. 
 
 Sajid, owner of a fast food centre, said, earlier he used to sell at least 100 egg-chicken rolls and 50 plates of chowmin and 50 plates of chilly chicken daily. Now the sale has reduced to less than half.
 
 "I had to retrench two staffers as sales have gone down in the last one month," he said.
