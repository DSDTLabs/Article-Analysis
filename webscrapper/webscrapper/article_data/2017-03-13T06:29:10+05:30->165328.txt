SURAT: An unidentified caller was booked at Hazira police station on Saturday for allegedly duping a 29-year-old engineer of Rs76,400 in online fraud. In an unusual method adopted by the fraudster, the victim was twice duped when the call was still continuing on mobile and the latter carrying out financial transactions through an   (ATM) here. 

 Sunil Sharma, an employee of   office, was duped in May 2016. Sharma had registered for an online job search website and subscribed for its service costing annual subscription of Rs7,300. He was supposed to get job notification e-mails. After a year when his subscription was going to end, Sharma received a call from some person who introduced himself as an employee of the online portal. He asked Sharma if he wished to continue his subscription with them. 
 
 Since the victim had got a job, he refused to continue the subscription. The caller told him that he can return Rs7,300 directly into his account if goes to the ATM with his debit card. The victim went to the ATM and inserted his card even as the call was on. The caller asked Sharma to follow his instructions and collected the victim’s debit card details. The fraudster spent Rs47,400 from the bank account of the victim. As soon as the call ended, Sharma came to know through SMS that money has been deducted from his account. He made a call to the caller and asked why money was withdrawn. The caller said it was a mistake and told him to go again to the ATM so that the deducted money could be deposited back into his account.
 
 Sharma again went to the ATM while the call was continuing on mobile and the fraudster spent Rs29,000 from the victim’s account. “The complainant was duped twice by the caller. We are working to identify the caller,” said police.
