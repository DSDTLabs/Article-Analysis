 “The party will write to the state government for appointment of the   Lokayukta,’’ said senior leader and former mayor Yogesh Behl, who has been appointed the opposition leader.
 
 “The NCP, which has got 36 seats in the 128-member house in PCMC, will sit in the opposition,’’ he said.
 
 Those who were in the race for the opposition leader’s post included senior corporators Mangala Kadam, Nana Kate, Datta Sane and Ajit Gavhane.
 
 In the last 15 years, NCP had implemented several development works, including BRTS, slum rehabilitation schemes, construction of flyovers, and widening of roads.
 
 “We were confident that citizens in Pimpri Chinchwad will vote for the NCP once again,’’ Behl said.
 
 The BJP has come to power for the first time in PCMC by winning 77 seats in last months’ elections.
 
 “The NCP will oppose any irregularities in the municipal corporation. The functioning of the ruling party should be transparent. The present ruling party (BJP) defamed the NCP and it created misunderstanding among citizens in the twin township. When we were the ruling party, we functioned in a democratic and transparent manner,” Behl said.
 
 The party had won with a brute majority in 2007 and 2012 elections.
 
 Both NCP chief Sharad Pawar and party leader and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, besides city unit chief Sanjog Waghere, have expressed confidence in the appointment of Behl as the party leader. Behl is a powerful orator and six-time corporator.
