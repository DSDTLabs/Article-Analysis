CUTTACK:   sleuths seized 80 grams of   worth Rs 8 lakh and 5 kg ganja and arrested two persons from   on Monday. 

 The accused, Manoj Kahali, 26, and Dilip Kahali, 28, are notorious drug peddlers, excise officials said. They used to procure brown sugar from   and sell it in small quantities to drug addicts in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar.
 
 To avoid detection, the duo had packed the brown sugar in small paper packets. In the past three months, this is third major seizure of brown sugar here.
 
 The flying squad of excise department seized 45 grams of brown sugar from Jobra and arrested one person on February 8. On January 31, they seized over 450 grams of brown sugar worth Rs 50 lakh from a car near   in Gandarpur. The two arrested persons included a former tax collector of Khurda municipality.
 
 Speaking about the modus operandi, excise officials said the small drug peddlers initially distribute brown sugar to the youths for free and when they become addicted to it, the peddlers find their permanent customers. "The racket is functioning in a well-planned manner. The drug peddlers are now getting brown sugar delivered at their homes in Cuttack," the excise officer said.
 
 The peddlers contact their suppliers in Balasore over phone and through some delivery boy their packet is sent to Cuttack. "Even if we arrest the delivery men, they have no information about the gang leader," said an excise official. Excise officials said brown sugar is transported from West Bengal to Balasore and from there it is distributed to rest of the state. tnn
