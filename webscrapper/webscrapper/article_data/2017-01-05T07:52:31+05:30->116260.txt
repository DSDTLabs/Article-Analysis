LUCKNOW: In a first of its kind move, state government will have all   operating their official fleet without pressure horns. Considering that noise pollution caused by vehicles and unnecessary honking give rise to major public inconvenience,   has called a meeting of   of all departments to remove   from vehicles. The move has come on the directions of the chief secretary. A separate government order, first of its kind, will be issued by end of this month to all government departments.

 Though use of pressure horns is a punishable offence under the MV Act, the accessory continues to be used by drivers. “Though MV Act bans use of pressure horns, the GO would be an executive order to enforce the law,” said sources in transport department. 
 
 It was decided in the meeting of the funds management committee held on December 27 under the chairmanship of the chief secretary that   should stop using pressure horns. Government vehicles, trucks and roadways buses use pressure horns more than others. “Trucks are checked more often for pressure horns but government vehicles certainly are big violators,” said sources in the transport department. A fine of Rs 1,000 would be imposed along with compounding fee on defaulters. Drivers of government vehicles and those sitting beside them will have to wear seat belts.
