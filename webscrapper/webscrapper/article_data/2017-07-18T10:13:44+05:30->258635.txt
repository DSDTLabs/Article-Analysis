KOCHI: The Roll-On Roll-Off ( ) service, proposed by the  , is yet to find an agency to operate the service. 

 Though the Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) has been roped in, the proposal by the agency has put the corporation authorities in a difficult situation. 
 
 “They have demanded that the vessels should be handed over to them. Besides, they should be given money for operating the services,” said an official with the corporation. 
 
 Meanwhile, there are demands that the operation of the Ro-Ro services should be entrusted with the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL). 
 
 “Even if any other agency is entrusted with the operation of Ro-Ro, they will sublease it to some other local contractors. This will again lead to chaos and accidents as such people don’t have the required expertize. So, it will be better to rope in KMRL. They are implementing the Water Metro project in Kochi,” said a councillor from the ruling front.
 
 The Ro-Ro vessels, constructed by Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL), have completed their trials. The vessels are now kept at the dock in the CSL. 
 
 Recently, the corporation had procured the vessels from the CSL prior to GST coming into force on July 1. 
 
 Meanwhile, the Cochin Port Trust is yet to complete the construction of jetties. Moreover, the vessels should secure all clearances, including safety certificates, from authorities concerned. 
 
 The cost of vessels is around Rs 3.8 crore each. The vessel has the capacity to carry four trucks with a load of 10 metric tonnes, 12 cars and 50 passengers or three trucks, 18 cars and 50 passengers.
