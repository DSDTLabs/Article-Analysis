PUDUCHERRY: Union external affairs minister   expressed deep concern over the increase in number of Indian   crossing the international maritime boundary line (IMBL) for fishing leading to their arrest and seizure of their fishing vessels by the Sri Lankan navy.

 Replying to a letter by former Lok Sabha MP   urging her to initiate efforts to secure the release of 17 fishermen from Karaikal, who were arrested by the Sri Lankan navy, Swaraj asked him to sensitise the fishermen community along the Palk Bay on the seriousness of crossing the IMBL and encourage them to diversify into deep-sea fishing.
 
 “There has been a marked increase in the apprehension of Indian fishermen and their fishing vessels in the last 10 days indicating increased number of Indian fishermen crossing the IMBL for fishing. You would appreciate that such increase does not help our diplomatic efforts to secure the release these fishermen and fishing vessels,” Swaraj replied.
 
 She said the Indian consulate in Jaffna confirmed that Sri Lankan navy arrested 17 Indian fishermen and seized their two mechanized boats for crossing the IMBL and fishing in Sri Lankan waters. 
 
 She said the Indian high commission in Colombo raised the issue with the Sri Lankan government and expressed optimism that the Sri Lankan government would release the arrested fishermen at the earliest.
 
 The Union minister said India and   had decided to resolve the recurring humanitarian issue in a holistic manner. 
 
 India had apprised Sri Lanka on the measures undertaken to phase out bottom trawling and to help fishermen to diversify to deep-sea fishing.
