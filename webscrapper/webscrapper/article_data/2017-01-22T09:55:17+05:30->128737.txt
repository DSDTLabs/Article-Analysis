 Accusing   MLA   of treason and creating misunderstanding between friends, former MMC chairperson and chairman of Ravindra Bhavan, Baina,   announced on Saturday that he is no longer supporting Naik. He has now extended support to Naik’s arch rival, Congressman Sankalp Amonkar.
 
  Khadapkar alleged that during last council election, when he was sure of a hattrick win, Naik fielded a candidate against him. “He was instrumental in my defeat and in an attempt to pacify me, gave me the charge of Ravindra Bhavan,” Khandapkar said.
