TRIPUNITHURA: The flash   going on at Indian Oil Corporation’s (IOC) bottling plant at Udayamperoor entered its fourth day on Monday. Workers resorted to the strike alleging delay in providing treatment to   (28), a contract worker, who had suffered 45% burn injuries while on duty on Friday.

 In the absence of an ambulance, Akhil was taken to a nearby hospital in a motorbike of one of his colleagues. 
 
 Akhil belongs to CITU union and irrespective of political differences, all workers decided to keep away from LPG refilling process from Friday.
 
 However, the company management has taken an adamant stand by saying that they will call a compromise talk only after the withdrawal of the strike. 
 
 “We are on warpath not for any new contract agreement but for a safe working atmosphere,” said a union spoke person. 
 
 Though the plant deals with highly inflammable liquid petroleum gas (LPG), the situation inside the plant is terrific as there is not even an ambulance service to meet with an emergency situation, said a worker from the INTUC union.
 
 Earlier in 2014, the factories & boilers department had temporarily cancelled the licence of the unit after finding lapse in safety measures which resulted in a major LPG leak from a bullet tanker.
 
  On Monday morning, representatives of CITU, BMS and INTUC unions boycotted the talks held in the presence of labour commissioner, citing the presence of AITUC representatives.
 
 Later, talks held at collector’s chamber in the afternoon. It also failed.
 
 In the coming days, a shortage of nearly 600 loads of LPG cylinders will be experienced in the open market, which spreads over seven districts in central Kerala.
