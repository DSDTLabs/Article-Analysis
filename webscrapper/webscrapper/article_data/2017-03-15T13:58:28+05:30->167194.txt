BHUBANESWAR: Resentment is brewing in BJD's Koraput unit since the suspension of former MP and party's district president   on Sunday by party president   for six years for  . 

 Though Pangi is yet to reveal his next course of action, political observers feel Pangi leaving the party will cost BJD dear as the former Parliamentarian is a popular   and has good organisational skills. Being a veteran politician, Pangi enjoys a solid tribal base and his expulsion has created a possibility of division in the party in the district, said  .
 
 Trouble began for Pangi after he blamed former minister  , Rajya Sabha member N Bhaskar Rao and energy minister Pranab Prakash Dash for not suggesting the name of Dumuri Khilla for the post of zilla parishad chairman on Sunday. 
 
 "I was not taken into confidence while choosing the candiate though I am the district unit president. The energy minister, Rabi Narayan Nanda, N Bhaskar Rao and Koraput MP Jhina Hikaka conspired against me," said Pangi. "I have done nothing wrong. I will decide on my political future after I get my suspension letter. If the party suffers in the district then it will be these leaders to blame," he added. 
 
 Party spokesperson Rabi Narayan Nanda refuted Pangi's allegations as baseless and dismissed any speculation that suspension of Pangi will have any negative impact on the party. According to Nanda, on March 5 in the district BJDs enlarged executive committee meeting it was unanimously decided to accept the decision of party president Naveen Patnaik for the post of ZP chairman and name of Prabhu Jani was selected by the party.
 
 However, Dumuri Khilla and few of Pangi's supporters raised slogans against Naveen Patnaik and burnt the party flag, he said. Since long Pangi has been involved in anti-party activities and after his suspension more tribal youths will join the BJD in the district. The party will emerge stronger, he added.
