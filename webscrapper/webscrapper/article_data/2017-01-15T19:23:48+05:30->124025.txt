KOLKATA: Another   has bitten the dust in Bengal. Dipping sales had threatened to close this single screen theatre. However, demonetisation was the last nail that broke the camel's back.

 In December this year,   in Salkia downed its shutter. Said owner Sumit Singh, "The hall had opened its doors in 1981. During those days, the hall enjoyed great patronage from the viewers." 
 
 Amitabh Bachchan's "Anusandhan" had run for 18 weeks. "Ram Teri Ganga Maili" had a dream run of 21 weeks. "Even 'Sultan' performed well. But one 'Sultan' can't help sustain a 118-seater theatre," Singh said.
 
 According to Singh, it used to take Rs 90,000 a week to run the theatre properly. However, that collection would be less than that. "How could I continue by sustaining such losses?" he asked.
 
 Post-demonetisation, the situation turned very grim. "I couldn't run a single night show from November 9 to November 30. Finally, I decided to down the shutters. There are quite a few multiplexes that have come up in the vicinity. People are heading towards them. I was left with no option but to close down my theatre," he said.
 
 On being asked about his future plans, Singh admitted that he has no intention of doing anything with the movies. "I have had enough of movies. I might use the space for making real estate investments," he concluded.
