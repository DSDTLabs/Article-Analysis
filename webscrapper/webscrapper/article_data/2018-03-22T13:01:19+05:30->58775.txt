CHENNAI: Jurists, disability rights activists and senior bureaucrats from the state government gathered here on Wednesday to discuss about the new Rights for Persons With Disabilities (RPWD) Act,  . 

 The Act fell short of expectations when it came to certain aspects of inclusive education and maintenance for people who undergo abuse or exploitation, said  , state commissioner for the differently abled.
 
 RPWD Act promises free and compulsory education for all children with disabilities up to the age of 18 in a school of their choice or neighbourhood school. 
 
 While the Right to Education Act, 2009, dealing with children in the age group 6-14 clearly says that the government should reimburse fees of students enrolled in private schools, the RPWD Act remains silent on reimbursing fees of children with disabilities who enroll themselves in secondary and high school courses in private institutions, Roy said. 
 
 There are no clear provisions in the RPWD Act explaining who will be liable to pay the maintenance in case of persons undergoing abuse or exploitation, he added. 
 
 Addressing a gathering organised by  , IP Dome and other NGOs, advocate P V S Giridhar said the Centre had cut budgetary allocations for SSA and RMSA functioning under the Union human resources development ministry towards inclusive education. “The allocations should increase for better implementation of the RPWD Act.” 
 
 Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh in his speech reiterated the efforts by the judiciary in recognising the rights of the disabled in several decisions, including the   vs Union of India case concerning concession for air travel.
