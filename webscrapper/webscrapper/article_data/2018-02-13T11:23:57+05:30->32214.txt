HYDERABAD: The recent incident of a young cricketer collapsing and passing away on the field after suffering a   brings to the fore the absence of cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training among people.

 Right from not identifying a cardiac arrest to not knowing when to seek help and crowding near the person, the absence of knowledge results in loss of many lives, say experts. Emergency response teams that attend to medical emergencies say panic and delay in identifying the gravity of the situation makes things worse.
 
 
 “At many accident spots that I have gone to as a responder, I’ve seen people leaning over the collapsed person to the extent that they may choke the person. Also, if there are more than 3-4 people around, they try doing things like sprinkling water or trying to stop the bleeding from an injury instead of identifying signs of a cardiac arrest,” said Vishnu, a responder with the EMRI.
 
 While there has been on and off efforts by organizations to take CPR training to the masses, the need of the hour is to teach CPR to school children, school teachers, bus drivers, cab and auto drivers, traffic police and even firemen, say experts.
 
 But before getting down to that there is a need to have trainers. “There is a dearth of training centres as well as trainers,” said Dr SSC Chakra  , coordinator,  .
 
 Also, there is a need for funding to set up such centres. There are about 50 training centres in the country run by various organizations. “We have planned to establish 15 training centres across the country, one of which will be in Hyderabad. The first centre has been set up with funding from NRIs in   and the next one is coming up in Hyderabad. But 15 more centres aren’t enough. So, we need to focus on training people who can then train others,” added Rao.
