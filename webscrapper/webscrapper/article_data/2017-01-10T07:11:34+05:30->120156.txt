JAIPUR: In a bureaucratic oversight by the state government, two IPS officers of Inspector General (IG) rank were given promotions this year while six IAS officers kept at their previous rank.This has made these IPS officers senior to the babus although all of them have the same date of joining.

 The two IPS officers Sanjay Agrawal (Police Commissioner, Jaipur) and Hemant Priyadarshy were promoted from the rank of IG to Additional Director General (ADG) on January 2. The slip up may have happened as the two are from 1992 batch but joined the services a year lat er on September 5, 1993, the date when the six IAS officers in question Tanmay Kumar, Akhil Arora, Alok, Aparna Arora, Shikhar Agrawal and Sandeep Verma ­ also joined.
 
 “Ideally, the promotions should have happened on the basis of the date of joining.However, because the batch year (the year in which a candidate is selected in UPSC) and the date of joining are usually the same, this slip-up happened,“ said a senior level bureaucrat. As per the hierarchy, an officer of ADG rank in the police services is on a par with a principal secretary rank officer of the administrative service. With the slip-up, the two IPS officers have superseded in rank the six IAS officers.
 
 Department of personnel (DoP) has admitted to the error and is now working to rectifying it. “We missed this fine print. Such an issue has never come to us. The case will be resolved soon,“ said Bhaskar A Sawant, secretary , DoP.
 
 TOI understands that now there are only two options before the government. Either they roll back the promotions of the two ADGs or they promote the six IAS officers to the rank of principal secretary .
 
 “At present, there is need for more principal secretaries. Most likely the government will promote the IAS officers,“ a senior official of DoP said.
