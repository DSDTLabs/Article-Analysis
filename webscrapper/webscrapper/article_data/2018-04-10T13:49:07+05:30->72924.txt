VADODARA: The   ( ) standing committee turned down a proposal to form a public trust for heritage in the city. The decision was taken as the civic body already has a small heritage cell looking in to heritage buildings and their renovation.

 The proposal for the trust was moved before the standing committee in September 2015, but no decision was taken regarding it and the item was held. The committee took it up again last month, but did not take a decision and postponed it.
 
 Sources said that the proposal was taken up for discussion again in the standing committee meeting last week. But the committee decided to turn down the proposal and send it back to the administrative wing. The administrative wing too does not seem to be keen on pushing for the trust any more. The proposal was moved in before the present standing committee chairperson Dr Jigisha Sheth and municipal commissioner   took over.
