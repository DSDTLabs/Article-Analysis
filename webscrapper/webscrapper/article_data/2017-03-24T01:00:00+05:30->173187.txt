Seventeen years ago,   decided to pay a tribute to his favourite perfume and cologne —   — by naming his band after the fragrance! The three-member troupe comprises Kieran (keyboards/vocals), Andrea-Jo Franco (vocals) and   (drums/ percussions). Says Kieran, “When we first formed the group, there were other members. Back then, we used to perform as a full band but eventually, we all got busy with other things. While   and I have been singing together for almost 17 years, Kristofor has been with us for three years.” 

 Inspired by different kinds of genres, they believe that their   has more rock and classic influences. “We love improvising on songs and give them our own take. We have a repertoire of over 2,000 tracks. We have been thinking for the last few years, maybe we should retire, but we have such a good time performing, that we are still at it,” says Kieran.
 
 Though passionate about playing music, the three of them also have alternate professions. While Kristopher is a journalist, Kieran and Andrea dabble in other part-time businesses. “We have been performing for so long that no matter how busy we are, we make time to jam with each other. We understand each other and know what to expect from one another.”
