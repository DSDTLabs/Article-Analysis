Nagpur: Dreaded poacher   alias Rahul Chhiyalal Pardhi was sentenced to three-year rigorous imprisonment by Judicial Magistrate First Class of Desaiganj on Friday in a case of tiger poaching. Last month, Kuttu had also been sentenced to three-year jail by JMFC SS Sayyed in Bhandara district.

 Following a tip-off from Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), Nagzira, Wadsa forest department had caught Kuttu and five other poachers near a farm on May 17, 2007. However, after completing identification process and other formalities, forest officials had to let go of the gang since there was no strong evidence against them that day.
 
 On May 29, officials found two traps and a knife at the farm following which a primary offence report (POR) was registered. When Kuttu was nabbed by a joint team of CBI and wildlife crime cell in March 2015, the same was intimated to Wadsa forest department. “We took over the case again and presented him in the court on January 21, 2016,” said assistant conservator of forests PG Kodape, who was investigating officer in the case.
 
 On Friday, JMFC Desaiganj KR Singhel ordered three-year imprisonment and a fine of Rs500 under sections of Indian Forest Act, 1927 and Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. 
 
 Kuttu used to operate at Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) corridor areas and had confessed to killing at least 6-7 tigers. He had escaped Bhandara police custody in January 2016 and was caught jointly by UP STF and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) from Lakhimpur Khiri on December 16, 2016.
