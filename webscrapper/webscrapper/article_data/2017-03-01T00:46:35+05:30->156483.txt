Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court observed on Tuesday that a judge hearing violence cases registered during the February 2016   was "under pressure". The high court neither mentioned the name of the judge nor specified the "pressure". "We are getting the impression that there is pressure on the trial judge. Don't pressurize the lady," a division bench, comprising Justice S S Saron and Justice Lisa Gill, said during the resumed hearing of a petition on cases pertaining to the   violence. 

 Additional solicitor general of India, Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Haryana government, assured the court that appropriate action will be taken against anybody intervening in the judicial functioning. The court also adjourned the next hearing the alleged Murthal rape case to March 15.
 
 The bench referred to some media reports regarding an assurance by the state government on withdrawal of criminal cases. "It is a cause of concern. It should not appear that cases are being withdrawn under pressure," observed the court. 
 
 Senior advocate Anupam Gupta, who is assisting the high court as amicus curie, submitted that since high court is hearing the matter and monitoring the cases, the state cannot make any promise for their withdrawal, as it could affect the sanctity or respect of the court in the eyes of public.
 
 The investigation of more than 2,100 criminal cases registered against the protesters for violence during February 2016 pro-quota stir in Haryana has been monitored by the HC since June 2016. Ilaqa (area) magistrate have been sending the progress report of such cases to the concerned district and sessions judge for forwarding to the HC.
