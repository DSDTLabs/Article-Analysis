BHOPAL: Union water resources minister   on Friday said the country will soon have potable water from sea at just 5 paise per litre. Trials for conversion of seawater into potable water have started in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu.

 
 Addressing the inaugural session of a two-day   at  ,   said it was unfortunate that some states were fighting over river water distribution while nobody is concerned about river water going to Pakistan. India shares 6 rivers with Pakistan.
 
 “Water from three rivers is flowing into Pakistan. But neither does any newspaper write on it, nor does any MLA demand to stop it,” Gadkari said.
