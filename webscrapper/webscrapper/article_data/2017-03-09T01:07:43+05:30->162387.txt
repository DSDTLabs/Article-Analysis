MUMBAI: Following a price crash and oversupply, there has been a record export of onions so far this year; 24 lakh metric tonnes of onions have been exported so far, as against 11.15 lakh in 2015 and 11.7 lakh in 2014.

 Officials said this was suppose to stabilize wholesale prices in the state, one of largest producers of onions, but even these record exports have not had any impact to pricing, which continues to nosedive. Onions continue to fetch Rs380-460 per quintal, as against the production cost of Rs 950 per quintal at the  , Asia’s largest onion market yard. Compared to last year, there has been over-production of 25 lakh metric tonnes of onions. 
 
 Although only about 10% onions grown in the country have been exported, the figure is important to keep price parity in wholesale markets.
 
 Exporters said the central government’s decision of giving a 6% export subsidy helped push some of the produce out of India.
 
 According to figures from the market committee, a daily supply of 30,000-35,000 tonnes is coming in to the market yard, as against 12,000-15,000 tonnes last year.
 
 Due to good rain and increase in area under production, it has been a bumper crop but the prices that slid last December due to demonetisation are struggling to stabilize even now, the fag end of the season.
 
 An exporter from Nashik said there was demand for Indian onions abroad and they fetched good prices. UAE, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are some buyers.
 
 Bumper production in states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka too has been cited as the reason for the glut, which had ensured that prices remain subdued throughout the year. State government officials said there have also been issues with storage in market yards. The entire dip in price and other losses due to rotting and lack of storage capacity is estimated to be close to Rs 800 crore.
