AHMEDABAD: Police on Wednesday nabbed two accused, who were at large, for stealing thousands of watre meters from AMC’s warehouse in Jamalpur. They were identified as Sajid Ali Syed, a security guard at the warehouse, and Pradip Goswami, the son of a former watchman, who lived in the warehouse compound.
