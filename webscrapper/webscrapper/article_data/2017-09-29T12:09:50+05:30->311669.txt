AMBALA: Flaunting a height of 210 feet, holding a 50-feet long sword, world’s largest effigy of Ravana can easily be spotted behind the tall eucalyptus trees on the   road, a 45-minute drive from the   railway station towards Barara.

 Dwarfing all others, the effigy of the demon king which   club makes every Dussehra, has made it to the   five times already and is aiming to find a mention in the Guinness Book of World Records.
 
 The effigy of the demon king would be lit up at Barara in Ambala district on September 30 with the help of remote control. The 210-feet effigy has been filled with eco-friendly firecrackers. 60 artisians took six long months of hard labour to finish the gargantuan figurine costing the club a little more than Rs 25 lakhs.
 
 The president of the Sri Ram Leela club Tejinder Chauhan said, “It takes immense effort to make the effigy and even more to make it stand straight. Even a little mistake could bring our-six-month long hardship to zero.”
 
 He said he had started to make the effigy in 1987 when the height of the Ravana was 20-feet. 
 
 The club had since then increased the height of the effigy every year till 2015 when the height was stopped at 210-feet due to space constraints.
 
 “The club has spent more money than before as the material used in the effigy is bought at a price after the levy of 12% and 18% GST tax rates,” said Chauhan.
 
 It was informed that about 30 quintal iron, 10 quintal bamboo, 1.5 quintal fibre, 1 quintal paper and 2000m cloth were used to prepare the effigy which weighs 4ton.
