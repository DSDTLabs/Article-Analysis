Mumbai: The world’s second largest reinsurer   has set up shop in India, with an investment of Rs 100 crore, and will inaugurate its first domestic branch on February 1. The company has been in business with India for 87 years, but has been able to establish locally as a reinsurer only now, after the law was amended to allow reinsurers operate through a branch structure.

 According to  , who heads Swiss Re, India, the company sees a lot of potential in crop and health   and in supporting a national catastrophe cover on which it is talking to the government. “India has a huge talent pool to support the insurance business which is why we set up our global business centre in Bengaluru.”
 
 “Given that the penetration of property and casualty insurance is only 0.72% of the gross domestic product we see a need to grow the market,” said Sampat. She added that even after natural catastrophes the insurance penetration in India has not risen.
 
 Swiss Re is among the first five foreign reinsurance companies to obtain a licence to sell reinsurance in India. “We will continue to be actively involved in supporting the development of the Indian insurance market and making India’s society more resilient. Our clients and partners will benefit a combination of innovative, customised risk transfer and capital management solutions, as well as our knowledge transfer and risk services support and delivery,” said  , CEO, of Swiss Re’s reinsurance business in Asia.
 
 In terms of the guidelines brought out by the  , branches of reinsurance companies need to retain 50% of the risk they underwrite in India. In other words they can pass only half of the risk and premium to the international market. Half the premium would have to be invested in India. In return the locally incorporated companies will get the right of first offer from the non-life insurance companies.
