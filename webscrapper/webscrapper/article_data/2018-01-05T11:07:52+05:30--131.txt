NEW DELHI: The   today took credit for the Centre deciding to not completely scrap the 8 percent interest-bearing Government of India (GoI)  .

 
 
 "We can be legitimately proud that our protests forced the government to issue GoI taxable bonds once again. Huge relief for middle class,   and retirees, tweeted senior Congress leader   today.
 
 The government had, on Monday, January 1, said that its popular  , 2003, earning 8 per cent interest per annum, will cease subscription from January 2.
 
 Chidambaram and others roundly protested this move. The former finance minister said it was a "severe blow" to the middle class and a "deplorable act" on the part of the government.
 
 "Modi government scraps 8% taxable bonds dealing a severe blow to the middle class. How will the risk-averse average citizen save?" Chidambaram said in a tweet on January 1.
 
  
  
 
 After Chidambaram and others protested, economic affairs secretary S.C.   on January 2 tweeted that the 8 per cent Savings Bonds Scheme, also known as RBI Bonds Scheme, will not be closed but will now be replaced by a 7.75 percent Savings Bonds Scheme.
 
  
  
 
 Chidambaram then wondered why Garg only tweeted this new bit of news without issuing a formal notification.
 
  
  
 
 He called it "strange".
 
  
  
 
 Finally, three days later, yesterday, Garg tweeted announcing that the 7.75% Savings Bonds Scheme had been notified.
 
  
  
 
 These 8 percent, and now 7.5% bonds are one of the last resorts for senior citizens and retirees wanting to earn higher interest income at a time when fixed deposit (FD) rates are falling.
 
 By comparison, FDs by banks pay about 6.25% to 6.75% interest rate. With a clear advantage to earn more from the government, these bonds gained popularity in the last one year after FD rates started coming down.
