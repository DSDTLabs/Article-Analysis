LUCKNOW: Uproar over possible moral policing notwithstanding, women in the city have welcomed the anti-Romeo squad. 

 "I'm glad it's being implemented. Such a move will deter ruffians from harassing girls," said Anupama Singh, mother of two girls, who had come to pick them up at a prominent school in Gomtinagar. 
 
 Food stalls outside   have been a favourite haunt of youths. Today, it was a different story, said students. Pragyanjali Singhal, a   student, said, "There are many food stalls here. Boys used to hang around and passed lewd comments. The presence of police will surely make a differnce." 
 
 School girls also welcomed the move.  , a Class IX student, said that at the time of programmes at school, like annual function or farewell, the situation worsened as ruffians made nasty comments about their attire. "Last year, after our annual function, a group of inebriated boys created ruckus close by. Thankfully, my parents had come to pick me up so I was safe," she said. 
 
 For Sonali Singh, student of a coaching student, " At least now there would be somebody looking out for us.Most of the times girls don't even report eve-teasing or harassment cases," she said.
 
 However, Krati Singh a college student, didn't agree. She said the move restricts freedom. The police cannot or should not stop anybody from standing anywhere. "Policemen must see their presence as a preventive measure. It is not a power given to them," she said.
 
 Aanchal Singh said removing fast food stalls outside colleges would be a sureshot way of getting rid of ruffians. "If they removed these stalls, most of them are anyway encroachments, I am sure we would be rid of miscreants as well because eating out is their best excuse in case they get caught or are questioned about their presence outside schools or colleges," she said.
