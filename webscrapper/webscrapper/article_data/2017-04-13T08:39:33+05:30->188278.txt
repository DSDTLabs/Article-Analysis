MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the   authorities to submit amended plans and approvals to show that a children's park has been excluded and not destroyed for the proposed Cuffe Parade station for the   line. 

 The direction came after advocate  , representing   (MMRDA) and   (MMRCL) said a revised plan for the station has now excluded 3,375 square metres of the park and that work will be carried out on the area shown as a road in the development plan.
 
 The HC had in February stayed until further orders the proposed cutting of 5,000 trees for the Colaba-Andheri Seepz line while hearing pleas challenging it. The petitioner's advocates said the park was destroyed despite the ministry of environment and forest refusing permission to carry out work there since the area falls under the coastal regulation zone (CRZ). 
 
 But Bagalia maintained the park has not been touched. She said the revised plan had been approved by the CRZ authorities. "According to you, the children's park is not disturbed at all. Then why did you remove all the plants?'' the bench asked.
 
 To see if the children's park area is excluded and whether there was destruction, the judges said they would see the "proposals, agenda under a resolution in the meeting so far as Cuffe Parade station is concerned". They directed MMRDA and MMRCL to place on record the revised plan on April 24. 
 
 When Bagalia said the petitioners were against the project, the judges said the authorities must not be under the impression that somebody was objecting to the Metro and pointed out that at the end of the day, it was for ease of transport for citizens. "By doing so, you can't massacre other important aspects needed for human living. There should not be carelessness and recklessness in damaging something that cannot be restored," the judges said.
