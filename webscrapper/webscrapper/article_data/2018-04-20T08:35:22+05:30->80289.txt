NEW DELHI:   on Thursday questioned the   verdict in the judge B H Loya case, saying the circumstances in which the judicial officer died were a deep concern for those who had faith in the judiciary. Despite the SC concluding that there was nothing suspicious in Loya’s death, Congress said it would continue to demand a probe and rejected BJP’s allegations that   was the “invisible hand” behind the petitions. 

 Party spokesperson   termed the allegations a “malicious attempt” that exposed BJP’s “jitteriness” and said the ruling marked a “sad letter day”. Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the “truth” would catch up with   chief   as he responded to BJP’s attacks with a sharp jibe on Twitter, “Indians are deeply intelligent. 
 
 Most Indians, including those in the BJP, instinctively understand the truth about Amit Shah. The truth has its own way of catching up with people like him.” Surjewala said questions raised by the case could only be settled by a probe and not by statements of a few judges to an administrative inquiry. 
 
 Calling again for an “impartial probe”, Congress said there was a preponderance of statements and evidence to question the natural death theory. “Judge Loya’s death was even raised by the four senior-most judges of SC... This only proves that even the SC judges were concerned about protection of rights and the independence of the judiciary,” it said. The reference was to the January 12 press conference of four SC judges in which they attacked the CJI for allotting sensitive cases to “preferred” benches.
