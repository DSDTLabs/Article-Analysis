SHAHJAHANPUR: The woman who was allegedly raped by former Union minister   has now lodged a complaint with additional director general alleging that the ex-minister and his aides have forged an affidavit in which she has “agreed” to withdraw the case against them.

 This comes days after the   government decided to withdraw the 2011 rape and abduction case lodged against him in Shahjahanpur. That decision did not cite a reason for withdrawal.
 
 In her complaint filed on the integrated grievance redress system (IGRS), popularly known as   portal, she said if her charges were found to be true, another FIR should be filed against   and his aides.
 
 The survivor told TOI, “I hope that the complaint filed by me on IGRS is taken seriously and if my allegations are true then an FIR should be filed against Chinmayanand and his aides.”
 
 Claiming threat to her life from the former minister, she said, “I have serious threat from Chinmayanand and his aides. They can attack me or my minor child anytime. I want this case to be transferred out of the state.”
 
 Despite many attempts, the former minister was not available for his comment.
 
 In her 2011 complaint, the woman had alleged that she was kept at an ashram in Haridwar and raped by the former minister. Her father had lodged an FIR against him at   police station in Shahjahanpur. However, Chinmayanand moved high court, which had stayed his arrest. The case is pending.
 
 On March 9, Shahjahanpur administration wrote to the prosecution officer of the case for the withdrawal of the case. The note did not cite any reason.
 
  has been a three-time BJP MP, having won from Badaun (1991), Machchlishahr (1998) and Jaunpur (1999). He was made MoS for internal security in Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.
