INDORE: While IMC has been complaining that   for the civic body, it has failed to tackle the  .

 Vendors and hawkers keep coming back at the same place. Now they have started using easily movable temporary structures to run their shops.
 
 While IMC claims vendors hamper road traffic, hawkers complain they do not have any other source of income.
 
 “This hampers our daily income badly. We earn on daily basis and if they take away our stalls, we lose a day’s income. It become difficult for us to survive,” said Raman, a tea vendor at Saket. Officials said they understood problems of vendors but could not permit them.
 
 “It’s not just a single cart that causes problems, they encroach upon roads that lead to traffic congestion and several areas of the city like Rajwada have been converted into hubs for hawkers. We cannot allow this to continue,” said IMC’s additional commissioner MS Chouhan.
 
 “If you remove a cart today, someone else will come appear with a new cart the next day,” Chouhan added.
 
 Earlier the civic body returned carts to the vendors. However, they have stopped the practice and do not return them.
