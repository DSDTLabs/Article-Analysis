NEW DELHI: Protests erupted at   University’s Sutlej hostel on Friday when several students had their mess privileges taken away due to non-payment of dues. According to students, this happened because they haven’t received their fellowship money to clear the dues. Though the matter was resolved on Friday night when students were given an extension of two months, many from other hostels are wary of going through the same ordeal as they too are reeling under months of debt. 

 “Around 227 out of the total 348 residents were told that they won't be served food in the mess,” said  , president of Sutlej hostel. “Many of these students couldn’t pay their dues because they haven’t received their fellowship money yet”. 
 
 According to Jha, students had cleared their dues till December, claims they haven’t received any money since then.
 
 He, however, points out another problem with Sutlej. “There is a huge backlog of dues, because many students don't pay up before leaving the hostel,” Jha said.
