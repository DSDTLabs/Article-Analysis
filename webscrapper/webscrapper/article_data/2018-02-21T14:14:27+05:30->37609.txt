PATNA: The   ( ) will start the drain and manhole-cleaning work in mid-March to prevent waterlogging during the monsoon later this year.

 Unlike earlier when most of the nullah-cleaning work was done manually, the civic body is planning to use technology for the purpose, PMC deputy municipal commissioner   said and added the empowered standing committee had given its nod for the same.
 
 “Two machines will be hired for three months, which will cost the PMC around Rs 80 lakh. One machine can operate even inside 20-ft wide lanes, while the other will be used on the main roads,”   said, adding the pre-monsoon cleaning exercise would cost around Rs six crore in addition to the Rs 80 lakh to be paid as rent for the two machines.
 
 Patna mayor   said the biggest challenge was to prevent waterlogging in the areas where the drains did not have outlets or where the drains were not linked. “Certain drains were destroyed because of the construction work undertaken by other departments,” she said and added the PMC would work on this problem.
 
 Sources attributed the PMC decision to use machines to the death of two workers while cleaning a manhole near the I-T roundabout last year. The duo had entered the manhole without any safety equipment and died of asphyxiation.
 
 The PMC has now also decided to provide mask and oxygen cylinders for such workers. Anand said they would target to clean all the drains by the June end although the work would continue till July 15.
