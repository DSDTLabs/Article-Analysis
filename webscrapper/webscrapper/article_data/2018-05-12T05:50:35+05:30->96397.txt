AHMEDABAD: The   high court on Friday rejected two PILs demanding that the   ( ) and the state government take possession of land allegedly encroached on by   on SG Road.

 The petitioners wanted the   to direct the authorities to auction the land, if they indeed wanted to sell it. They submitted that the club itself valued the land at Rs 264 crore.
 
 In 2007, two PILs were filed claiming that the club’s management had encroached on 12,000 square metres of government land. The petitioners demanded that the alleged illegal construction on this plot, including the Golden Glory Hall, be demolished.
 
 The issue reached the   after the high court proposed that the club pay 2.5 times the market rate and have the construction regularized. The petitioners objected to this interim direction for conditional regularization and unsuccessfully moved the apex court in January 2016.
 
 The club’s advocates submitted that the land was bought from the previous possessor through an agreement and this was therefore not an encroachment on government land.
 
 The petitioners held that the HC order to regularize ownership on payment of 2.5 times the market price could only be computed after ascertaining the market price. They held that jantri rates were not enough and a public auction must be held to ascertain the value, according to various orders by the   and HCs. They claimed that the club valued the land at Rs 264 crore, but if the real price was to be computed at market rates, it would be higher.
 
 It was also argued that the alleged encroachment cannot be regularized because the club’s agreement with the previous occupier was invalid, since this was “new tenure” land. The construction was put up despite notices by the civic body and prohibitory orders being issued.
