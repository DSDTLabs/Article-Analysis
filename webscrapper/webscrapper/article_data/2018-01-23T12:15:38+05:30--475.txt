VADODARA: Ahead of the convocation ceremony, cops detained MSU senate member Kapil   on Monday morning while they kept a watch at residence of former senate and syndicate member Dr I I  , who had earlier sought permission to immolate self. 

 Even as Joshi, a vocal critic of MSU vice-chancellor professor  , insisted that as elected senate member it was his right to attend the convocation ceremony for which the police department itself had issued special pass, Joshi was not allowed to attend the ceremony. 
 
 “I had told the cops that I had no plans to protest against the President. Yet, the cops, who were completely clueless on why they were detaining me, misbehaved with me,” Joshi told media persons. 
 
 Cops had also made attempts to detain Pandya, the former president of   (BUTA). But since Pandya was not at his residence, the cops reached his residence and remained put up till the time the convocation ceremony got over. 
 
 “When the cops called me, I told them to give me in writing stating the reason for this mental torture which me and my family members faced without any reason,” said Pandya, adding that he had not broken any law and hence police had no authority to reach his residence. 
 
 On Sunday, Joshi had put hoardings across the city alleging irregularities by MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas which were later brought down by Vadodara Municipal Corporation. 
 
 Interestingly, although cops had reached senate member Narendra Ravat’s residence, Ravat did attend the convocation ceremony while a cop remained stationed with him in his car.
