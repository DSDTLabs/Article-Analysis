BHBUNESWAR:   Ashok Panda on Tuesday said   recorded over 30 per cent growth in terms of foreign tourist arrival in the last three years. Addressing a news conference here, Panda said more than one lakh   visited the state in 2017 - a marked improvement over the 71,417 foreigners who visited in 2014. 

 There has also been a growth in the number of domestic tourists who visited the state in past three years. "While 1.07 crore tourists from within the country visited Odisha in 2014, the number increased to 1.40 crore in 2017," Panda said.
 
 A brand campaign for Odisha Tourism in national and international platforms, a well-planned marketing strategy, organization of national and international events and making international flight services operational from Bhubaneswar to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok are considered as some of the key reasons behind the growth in domestic and international tourist flow into the state.
 
 For safety of the tourists visiting the state, the government has set up eight tourist police cells at Puri, Chandrabhaga, Dhauli, Gopalpur, Nandankanan, Lingaraj Temple, Satapada and Chandipur. "Tourist police patrolling has been in operation on the Puri-Satapada and   routes," said the tourism minister.
 
 To queries on expanding the tourism potential of the state, Panda said the tourism and the forest and environment department have been developing the scope of eco-tourism potential in the state.
 
 Speaking on the Baristha Nagarika Tritha Yatra Yojana - the annual pilgrimage programme for senior citizens that started in 2016 - the tourism minister said five tentative trips have been proposed for 2018-19.
