ISLAMABAD: In probably one of the most innovative such initiatives, Pakistan is planning to press donkeys in service of cementing ties with Beijing, the hope being that these quadrupeds could achieve better results than career diplomats as beasts of diplomatic burden.

 Experts said this isn’t such a doltish idea, as the move could serve another purpose as well: proper utilisation of the   ( ).
 
 The provincial government has, as a matter of fact, declared a Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa-China Sustainable Donkey Development Programme to foster breeding and export of donkeys to China. 
 
 According to media reports, donkey hides fetch anywhere from 18,000 to 20,000 Pakistani rupee per piece on export to China, which makes this such a kick-ass move.
 
 The initiative is based on the fact that donkeys can be sustainably developed in   where jackasses abound and are otherwise a neglected group of animals. 
 
 That these close cousins of mule have value in China for their skin —the gelatin from hide is used for manufacturing high-value medicines — helps.
 
 According Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-CPEC website, “Under the proposed project, it is planned to develop and enhance the donkey population so as to ensure regular and uninterrupted backward supply for export of live animals and enhancing income of donkey breeders and traders in the province.” 
 
 The website further trumpets: the proposed project will help in improving socio-economic status of donkey rearing communities through improvement of health and production of local breeds.
 
 In 2015, Pakistan had placed a temporary ban on export of donkey hide, fearing extinction of the neddy, as well as for the possible consumption of its meat.
