Rajkot: A massive fire broke out in an oil tanker anchored around 15 nautical miles off Deendayal Port Kandla on Wednesday. 

 The fire broke out in oil tanker MT Genessa, the 183 meter long vessel which is carrying around 30,000 tonnes of high-speed diesel. Sources in Coast Guard, which swung into action, said that 26 crew members were safely evacuated from the burning ship and two of them suffered burn injuries.
 
  As many as nine tugs from Kandla and Mundra along with vessels of Indian Coast Guard, Navy and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) were trying to control the blaze till late in the night.
 
 Coast Guard is trying to douse the blaze using tugs and rigs available from nearby resource agencies. Interceptor Boat C-403 is coordinating rescue and fire fighting effort. The pollution control team activated ICG Dornier into. Coast Guard pollution control vessel has also been dispatched to the site to control oil spill if any.
 
 “The fire was very serious. Luckily, one of our tugs was close by when the fire broke out at around 6:15pm. Immediately, the crew members were rescued and five more tugs were dispatched for dousing operations,” Ravi Parmar, chairman, Deendayal Port Trust, told TOI. 
 
 Two pollution control vessels of the coast guard were expected to reach Kandla by midnight. Parmar said that the fire is suspected to have sparked in the accomodation quarter where the crew members on the vessel live. 
 
 The vessel of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) was to offload the high-speed diesel at Kandla port.
