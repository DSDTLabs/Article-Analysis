AHMEDABAD: The   on Tuesday directed the   to pay Rs 50,000 as   to a   who was not released from prison though remission of his sentence had been recommended to the government. The court held that the prisoner’s fundamental and human rights had been violated. 

 Justice A J Desai was not happy with the state government’s approach in dealing with the prisoner, Prabhatji Dabi from Mehsana, who had already served more than 13 years in jail. After the recommendation of remission was made last year, he was supposed to be released on January 26 this year and an order was issued in this regard a day earlier.
 
 According to Dabhi’s advocate, Dilbur Contractor, the release order contained two conditions for the grant of remission — on having served 12 years in jail and the lack of any incident of abscondance in the last 10 years. On January 26, he was about to be released, but jail authorities were ordered to contain him at the last moment on the grounds that Dabhi had jumped furlough once and had not surrendered to jail authorities. He was arrested and punished with a one-year jail term, which was to run concurrently.
 
 The state government was told that Dabhi’s abscondance happened much before the 10-year period and the subsequent conviction resulting in one-year imprisonment had already been served. However, the authorities did not consider this aspect. Dabhi moved the high court and Justice Desai concluded that the government had committed a mistake in this case resulting in the violation of prisoner’s human rights because he had to spend seven more months in jail.
