NAGPUR: The Kasansur Local Organizational Squad (LOS), a formation of banned CPI (Maoist) in south Gadchiroli, murdered 55-year-old police warden (patil)   (Kumoti) of   village in   taluka. The Naxalites had abducted Pungati on Wednesday evening. He was found with his throat slit, and the face and head smashed with a stone, outside Lanji village on Thursday.

 The Naxals, who left a letter in the pocket of the slain police warden, claimed that they killed Pungati because he was a police informer. The Kasansur dalam, led by commander  , has claimed in the letter that they held Pungati responsible for the information of their presence in the forest of Tadpalli in Etapalli on January 10 this year. Naxal area committee member (ACM) Kamlesh had been gunned down by a combined force of Quick Response Team (QRT) and Etapalli police post party here.
 
 An experienced cop said the Kasansur dalam members appear to have assumed or got information that Pungati was having links to the cops from Etapalli police station. 
 
 Sources said Pungati had gone to his farm along with son, daughter-in-law and wife to guard the crop. Pungati’s wife had a verbal tiff with the heavily armed Maoists when they came in a group of around 15 to take him away. She tried to challenge them, but was overpowered by the rebels. Pungati did not return later in the day, and the body was discovered outside the village at day break.
 
 Additional SP  , in-charge SP, Gadchiroli, condemned the heinous murder and said the Maoists target anyone who stands for development. “Maoists have so far killed around 500 innocent tribals on some or the other pretext. Their labelling an innocent tribal as a police informer is the easiest modus operandi to eliminate someone,” he said.
