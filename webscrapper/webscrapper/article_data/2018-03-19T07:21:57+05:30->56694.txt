CHANDIGARH: Three labourers were burnt to death and six others sustained injuries in a devastating fire that broke out in three paint manufacturing units in industrial area in  . The fire, which was probably caused by a short-circuit at around 4.30am in one of the factories, rapidly engulfed the other two, forcing workers to jump off rooftops. 

 Inspector Rishi Kant, SHO,   police station said a case of negligence causing death has been registered against factory owner  , manger  , and three unidentified supervisors at Rai police station on the complaint of family members of one of the victims. 
 
 "We are collecting DNA samples of relatives for profiling with ashes recovered from the remains of the factory room. We have also asked the fire department and industries department to provide us copies of safety norms for such units," said Rishi Kant.
 
 Sources said initially, the fire in one unit was not noticed. As it spread, it triggered a blast, waking labourers sleeping on the roof. Before they could react, the fire had spread to all the three factories.
 
  It took 10 fire tenders five hours to douse the flames. Since this was a chemical fire, the flames took time to settle as fire repeatedly broke out when inflammable material mixed with water. Forensic experts collected samples and examined places where the fire could have broken. 
 
 "Our first priority was to carry out relief operations. We have initiated the process of identification of the deceased. At the same time, we are also recording statements of the injured and those employed in the factory,'' said Sonipat SSP Satender Kumar Gupta.
