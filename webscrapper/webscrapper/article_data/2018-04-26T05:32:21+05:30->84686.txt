MUMBAI: Green campaigners have questioned the   over its decision to cut big branches of an 85-year-old rain tree in   (west) on LBS Road, on Wednesday.

 
 The same tree was earlier saved by ‘Chipko’ movement pioneer   in October 2005 when the MMRDA was planning to hack it. “Many citizens informed me that the branches of this landmark tree were being chopped by S Ward staffers. We were told that the branches were being trimmed. However, we fear that this trimming may have gone too far, hence the experts should look into it. This was a special tree once hugged by activist Sunderlal Bahuguna and his wife  ,” said activist   of the NGO Plant and Animals Welfare Society. An official from the BMC’s gardens department of S Ward said, “We have undertaken the trimming of several trees along LBS Road ahead of monsoon. Hence, the branches of this rain tree were cut so that it does not topple over. Its roots were damaged during some civic work, hence some branches have been trimmed.”
 
 “We have take all the requisite permission to trim the branches. It is being done only to help this big tree maintain its balance,” he added.
