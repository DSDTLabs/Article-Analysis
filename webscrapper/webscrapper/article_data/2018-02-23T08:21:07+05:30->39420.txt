BENGALURU: The department of higher education said it is looking into   to procure marks cards equipped with near-field communication ( ) technology despite being forbidden from doing so. 

 On Thursday, TOI had reported that the university, ignoring the November 2017 directive to stop use of NFC marks cards and certificates, approved the Rs 3.3-crore (annual) bid from an Andhra Pradesh-based printer for procuring them. Hours later, the principal secretary, the department of higher education, said the university's January 18, 2018 bid approval was on the government's radar. The directive to stop using the NFC-fitted marks cards came after a series of cases of them being fake surfaced. It has also turned out that the department had on February 2, slapped a notice on the university, asking why it disobeyed the directive and approved the bid.
 
 "The university responded to us a wee k later, saying that the bid process was completed much before the November 2017 directive reached it. We are yet to decide on what action needs to be taken next," an official from the higher education department said. As per the tender documents, accessed by TOI, the university approved the financial evaluation of the tender on January 18 this year, two months after the government's directiv e to all universities. 
 
  "The direction from the government came to us on November 13. But, our tender process was completed on October 24. We've written to the government saying we have completed the MoU with the third party. If the government asks to cancel it, we'll do it," Prof K Byrappa, vice-chancellor of th e university, had told the media on Wednesday.
