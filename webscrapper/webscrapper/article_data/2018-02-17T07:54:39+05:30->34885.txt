BATHINDA: The state consumer redressal commission has directed Bathinda Improvement Trust (BIT) to refund money paid by flat allottees in view of non-fulfilment of conditions during the construction.

 Earlier in March 2017, the local bodies department had placed 10 officials including four executive officers and engineers under suspension, taking note of irregularities in the construction of flats in  , a housing scheme of BIT. 
 
 The allottees had complained about the alleged use of sub-standard material in the construction of flats and had even met Punjab local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu.
 
 Naresh Garg and  , counsels of the allottees, said, “The state commission on Thursday decided the matter and ordered the BIT to refund full money of the allottees.”
 
 Manmohan Kalia Enclave scheme was hanging fire since 2010 and nearly Rs 20 crore had been spent on building 96 flats of 1,650 square feet each. The buyers were waiting for the allotment of flats since 2013 when the trust authorities were supposed to hand over the possession.
 
 The BIT had started the scheme on   road near Transport Nagar and 96 flats were built under the scheme out which 60 were sold through draw of lots whereas 36 remained unsold.
 
 “We paid Rs 26 lakh for each flat. The trust authorities had assured to allot the flats in October 2013, but these are still to be allotted to their rightful owners,” said one allottee Sunil Singla.
