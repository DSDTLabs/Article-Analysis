MUMBAI: A 65-year-old   who is in jail for allegedly  , moved the   for bail claiming the girl and her parents, who were  , had been  . 

 Justice Mridula Bhatkar declined to release the accused Abdul Shaikh pointing out that there were other witnesses and a medical report that the prosecution had cited as evidence against him in the crime. 
 
 “It appears from the submissions of the prosecution that the material witnesses—two eyewitnesses and the medical record of the victim—are available. She was a girl of three-and-a-half years old,” said Justice Bhatkar and added that the court had also gone through the deportation papers. 
 
 While refusing bail, the high court asked the sessions court to complete the trial before December 31.
 
 Shaikh was arrested on March 24, 2015, for raping his neighbours’ minor daughter. The Kalwa police charged him for the offence of rape under the Indian Penal Code and for sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Shaikh’s lawyers claimed that he was in jail for around two years and though the charge sheet had been filed, trial had not proceeded. 
 
 The victim and her parents were Bangladeshi nationals and were deported by the order of a magistrate in October 2015. Since the victim and her parents were not available for giving evidence, the trial had stalled, the lawyers contended, while seeking bail. 
 
 Additional public prosecutor Deepak Thakery opposed bail pointing out that the victim was a minor. The prosecutor said that there were two eyewitnesses who were available to testify during the trial. The medical certificate that confirmed the sexual assault was also produced by the prosecution.
