MUMBAI: A government railway police ( )   was   by three men who were in an inebriated state, at   station early on Tuesday.

 Two of the accused—Rajesh Devgadhi (32), a hawker, and Salim Shaikh (47), a real estate agent—have been arrested; their unidentified aide is at large. They are accused of attacking constable Suryakant Yelhe (49) who was on night patrol duty.
 
 Around 1.20am, Yelhe spotted the men creating a ruckus on the east-west-connecting railway bridge. “The three were drunk and damaging the platform indicator when Yelhe gave them a warning and told them to vacate the   premises,” said Vasai GRP senior inspector Mahesh Bagwe.
 
 Instead of leaving, the trio got into an argument with the cop. Yelhe thought they had finally seen reason when they began to walk towards the eastern side, saying they were on way to their respective homes. 
 
 As Yelhe began to climb down the stairs to return to Platform Four where he was seated earlier, they charged towards him and pushed him down the steps. Yelhe landed on the platform and ended up dislocating his shoulder and injuring his legs.
 
 Yehle managed to grab hold of Devgadhi and Shaikh while their friend fled. In the melee, Devgadhi, too, fell off the staircase and hit his forehead. Yehle is being treated at Alliance Hospital in Nalasopara and will undergo a surgery for his shoulder.
 
 The accused have been charged under Indian Penal Code sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging duty) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from duty).
