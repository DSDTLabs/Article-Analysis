NOIDA: A 24-year-old   was found hanging from an iron road on the terrace of the HCL office in Sector 126 around 6 pm on Monday.

 Police said Deepak, who had been working at the office for the past four years as a sweeper, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself with the help of an electricity cable. The incident occurred around 4 pm when Deepak went to the terrace above the corporate office on the fifth floor of the building.
 
 Expressway SHO   told TOI that the body was found when Deepak’s younger brother  , who also works in the same office, went looking for him.
 
 “It seems that he went to the terrace, which is usually unmanned. Bunty spotted his brother’s body and informed his family members and police around 6 pm. The body was removed from the noose in front of his family,” he said.
 
 As no suicide note was found near the body, police said it seems to be a suicide.
 
 “The family members have demanded a compensation of about Rs 30 lakh from the company but the company wants to settle it at Rs 7 lakh. The incident has led to a dispute between the parties,” an officer said.
 
 A spokesperson for HCL told TOI that Deepak was a contractual employee of CB Richards Ellis, which handles facility management for the company. “We will get back with more details,” the spokesperson said.
