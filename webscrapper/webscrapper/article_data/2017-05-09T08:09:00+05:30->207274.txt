GURGAON: The stalemate over holding   continues as the Haryana government for the second time failed to submit the final notification of ward delimitation to the high court on Monday.

 The civic elections have been pending for over a year now, and there does not seem to be any urgency on the part of the state government to expedite the process so that the polls can be held at earliest. The court has posted the matter for hearing on May 26. 
 
 The   and some residents had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court earlier this year, objecting the way the new boundaries for each ward were drawn by the district administration.
 
 The court had then asked the state government to respond to this objection. The government then claimed that it was only a proposed notification, and a final notification was yet to be published, thereby implying that the redrawn boundary was not final.
 
 The state government was supposed to submit the final notification to the court on Monday, but it rather informed it that the final notification is still under preparation. The court then listed the matter for May 26.
 
 While urban local bodies minister Kavita Jain could not be contacted by TOI despite repeated attempts to understand why the government was delaying the process to hold elections, her husband and   spokesperson Rajiv Jain claimed that the his party was keen to hold MCG elections as soon as possible. “There is no delay from our end whatsoever and we want to hold the election as soon as possible. However, I will find out what is the reason for the delay,” he told TOI. Gurgaon deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh, who heads the ad-hoc committee to oversee the delimitation process, also could not be contacted despite several attempts.
 
  “There is absolutely no credible reason why the   government should delay MCG elections, which have been pending for more than a year now. The court also seems to come to their aid,” said Arun Kumar, a sector 40 resident.
