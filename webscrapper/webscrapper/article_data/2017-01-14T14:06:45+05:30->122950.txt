QUEPEM: Former   (QMC) chairperson and four-time councillor   was elected unopposed as QMC chairperson on Friday morning, at a special meeting held in the council hall. The meeting had been convened due to the sudden resignation of former chairperson Filu D’Costa, recently. Project director of the District Rural Development Agency (South), Laura Britto, was the presiding officer.

 D’Costa was elected unopposed as chairperson after Congress swept the civic polls with 9 out of 11 seats in November 2015.
 
 Speaking to TOI, D’Costa said, “As per mutual understanding, I have resigned from the chairperson's post to make way for Pereira. My one-year term as chairperson was decided at the beginning”. 
 
 Sources said that four councillors will get an opportunity to head the council during the four-year term. Sources alleged that Pereira had planned to support the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is he wasn’t made chairperson. 
 
 With the assembly election in mind, Quepem MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar requested D’Costa to step down to avoid any rebellion, sources said.
