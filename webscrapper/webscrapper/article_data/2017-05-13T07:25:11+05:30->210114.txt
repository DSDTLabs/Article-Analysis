NASHIK: A farmer from Vasai's Kopri village has given wings to the ambitious project of starting an academy to train tribal, rural and poor students who aspire to appear for the   (UPSC) examination and join the Indian Administrative Services (IAS). 

 Kashinath Patil on Thursday donated two buildings, whose market value is reportedly Rs 32 crore, for the academy to the Sri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST) which has undertaken the project in Shirdi. The buildings are located on an estate owned by him in   town near Shirdi.
 
 The trust's chief executive officer, Rubal Agrawal, said the multi-storied buildings have been constructed on a 9,700 sqm land at village Nighoj in Rahata, some 10km from Shirdi. "Patil formally transferred both buildings to our trust on Thursday," she said.
 
 Patil is a Saibaba devotee and runs 'Sai Shelters' along Mumbai-Shirdi route. The shelters offer accommodation and other facilities to pilgrims travelling on foot.
 
 Dr Suresh Haware, president of the trust, said retired IAS and IPS officers have agreed to teach at the academy. "The academy will provide free training and guidance to poor youths from rural and tribal areas. We hope to see more youths from the tribal belt of north   joining the administrative services in the near future," he added.
