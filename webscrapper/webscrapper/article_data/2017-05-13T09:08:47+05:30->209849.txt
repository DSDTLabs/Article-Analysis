LUCKNOW: Senior   leader and state vice-president   has threatened to sue   chief   after the expelled leader of her party, Naseemuddin  , hinted that she had asked him (Siddiqui) to eliminate him.

 Daya Shankar had hit the headlines for his controversial remarks on Mayawati leading to his expulsion from the party. He was also arrested and sent to jail. Later on, he was reinstated in the party. Daya Shankar’s wife Swati Singh is now minister in the Yogi government.
 
 Talking to TOI, the BJP leader said that Siddiqui in his press conference had disclosed that the BSP chief, Mayawati orders physical harm to those who attacked her politically. “She had ordered to burn the bungalow of a leader and had desired to eliminate another who had commented on her” Daya Shankar quoted Siddiqui’s statement. This shows, said Daya Shankar, that Mayawati had conspired to kill him also and he would confirm it from Siddiqui before suing her.
 
 It was on Mayawati’s instructions that a number of BSP leaders had threatened to kill him and the police should lodge a case against her. “I had also been threatened by a number of mafia dons at the instance of Mayawati,” claimed Daya Shankar. 
 
 “I reiterate that the BSP chief auctions the party’s ticket to earn money,” he said, adding that Mayawati expelled Siddiqui to save herself from the investigation which he was facing and both were involved in corruption and irregularities.
