RAIPUR: Staff at three   are under investigation following allegations that they refused a   widow in labour admission, thus forcing her to deliver her child in a shed in 47°C weather without any medical help at hand.

 The incident was reported from the Bilha block of   district, one of the places where a pilot run of the PM Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, which aims to bring down maternal mortality, is being carried out.
 
 The widow, Muskan Khan, 27, a resident of village Sirgitti, lost her husband two months ago. When she went into labour on May 17, her neigbours called for the Mahtari Express — a free ambulance service for expecting mothers — but were kept waiting for one and a half hour. While waiting for the ambulance, they took her to the community health centre, where they alleged the guards abused them and the doctors asked them to take Muskan to Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS) in Bilaspur.
 
 According to her neighbours, the doctors at CIMS refused her admission as well, saying they had no vacant beds. Thereafter, she was taken to the district hospital, but was allegedly turned away from there too. Muskan’s neighbours alleged they were turned away despite having a reference letter from Chhattisgarh urban development minister Amar Agrawal. When the issue was taken up with the district administration by the media, Muskan was promptly admitted by the district hospital.
 
 Despite several attempts, TOI was unable to contact divisional commissioner Niharika Barik. CIMS PRO Aarti Pandey denied any patient named Muskan had approached them, but doctors at the district hospital admitted that the staff on duty “committed a mistake".
