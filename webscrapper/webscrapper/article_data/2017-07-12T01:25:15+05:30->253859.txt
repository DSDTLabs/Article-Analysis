Mohali: Police on Tuesday booked three persons for duping a Balongi resident of Rs 12.5 lakh on the pretext of sending him to England.

 The accused were identified as Sandeep Rana, his wife Menu and Rahul Kumar, all residents of Mullanpur. They were booked on the complaint of Krishan Kumar.
 
 The incident happened in 2016 when Krishan Kumar approached the accused after seeing their advertisements for sending people abroad. Krishna wanted to apply for work permit in England.
 
 The accused took Rs 12.50 lakh from Krishan Kumar assuring him that he would get his visa within 6 months and it would be valid for 6 years.
 
 Krishan, who belonged to a middle class family and worked in a private organization as a security guard, had taken loan and borrowed some money from his relatives for the purpose.
 
 He submitted his documents with the accused in June last year. After submission of the documents, the accused directed him to get back after four months.
 
 However, when Krishan approached the accused regarding the visa to England, they started giving excuses.
 
 In the month of January this year, Krishan approached the accused, but he was shocked to find out that the trio had shut down the office and switched off their cell phones.
 
 After failing to trace the whereabouts of the accused, the Balongi resident finally decided to approach the police and filed a complaint. After investigating the matter, an FIR was registered against the accused under relevant sections of IPC.
