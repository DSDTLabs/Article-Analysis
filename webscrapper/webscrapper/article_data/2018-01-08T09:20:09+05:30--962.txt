HYDERABAD: The ruling TRS is readying its armoury to counter the opposition Congress' stance on sand mafia. It also wants to take on claims that 24x7 power supply being extended by the TRS government to the agriculture sector is an outcome of power plants set up by previous   government. 

 Not just the Congress, the TRS also wants to counter the   for taking credit for improving power generation scenario in   through central schemes.
 
 Chief Minister   has taken a serious view of the Congress and BJP taking credit for 24x7 power supply to farm sector. The Congess has in fact charged the TRS government of having failed to generate a single unit of power through power plants that were started after KCR-government came into office.
 
 On sand mining, sources said KCR wants ministers to get details from their departments and to come out with statistics on revenue status during 10-year Congress regime and the huge revenue earned during just the last three years of TRS rule.
 
 "KCR is not happy with the way TRS ministers and its leaders have been countering misleading campaigns by the Congress, BJP and TJAC on issues such as sand mafia, power supply, proposed input subsidy scheme for farmers and crop loan waiver scheme. The ministers and TRS leaders have been asked to study subjects thoroughly and give befitting replies to Congress and BJP," a senior TRS leader said.
 
 The ruling TRS has decided to take on the Congress both outside and inside the   with proof of its failures in its 10-year rule. A major area that is going to be targeted is graft. TRS leaders will challenge the Congress to submit proof on allegations being made by them.
 
 TRS leaders will also intensify campaign explaining that KCR government is spending over Rs 50,000 crore on welfare schemes.
