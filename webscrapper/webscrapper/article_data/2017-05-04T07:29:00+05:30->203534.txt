LUDHIANA: Two   snatched a purse from a lady --   -- while she was sitting in an autorickshaw. After she raised an alarm, a few meters away the bike of the snatchers slipped, and the commuters nabbed them, gave a beating, and handed them over to the police. However, when Kaur, along with her husband,  , reached the Shimlapuri police station, the police allegedly made them wait for an hour to get an FIR registered.

 Gandhi, an advocate, said, his wife had gone to Jalandhar to meet some relatives. On Tuesday afternoon, she returned from there and hired an auto from the Bus Stand up to Gill Road. Later, when the auto driver slowed down to pick up more passengers near Gill Chowk, the miscreants snatched the purse of his wife. After Kaur informed her husband, to reach Shimlapuri police station, they both waited for an hour there to get their FIR registered. “Later, when I told the cops I would go to the office of commissioner of police to get the FIR registered, they listened to us and lodged an FIR.” The purse contained a gold chain, mobile phone, and some cash.
