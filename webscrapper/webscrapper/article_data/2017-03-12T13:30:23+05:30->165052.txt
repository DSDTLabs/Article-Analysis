BHUBANESWAR: Planning to go out for shopping but worried about   space. Don't worry, for now you can book a parking space even before seting out from home. 

 The Bhubaneswar One web portal, which is sort of an e-platform and information bank, will furnish parking-related data. There will also be an app that will allow people book parking space. The design of the app will be such that it will provide GIS-based data on the location and parking space available.
 
 The service will soon be launched by   ( ). 
 
  Sources in BSCL said the pre-booking of parking space will be done under Smart Parking Management System, which is one of the six components of Master System Integrator (MSI).
 
  On March 7, the state government gave go-ahead to the BSCL to implement MSI, which will act as the central command centre for all IT-based services to be undertaken in smart city projects. 
 
 Official sources said pre-booking can be availed in 5,500 street parking lots and 1,500 multi-level car parking (MLCP). So far, the BSCL has decided to set up MLCP at two busy locations at Unit-II near   and Saheed Nagar. While Rajmahal lot can accommodate 452   and Saheed Nagar MLCP will have space for 256 cars. Both the projects will be completed within one and a half years.
