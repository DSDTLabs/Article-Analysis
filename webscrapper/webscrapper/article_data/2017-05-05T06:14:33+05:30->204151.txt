 Ramdev said the Haridwar-based FMCG player has recorded Rs 10,561 crore in revenue for 2016-17 with most of its products, including ghee and toothpaste, garnering healthy market share in their respective categories.
 
 “We will become the largest home-grown FMCG player in the next one year,“ said Ramdev. The company's aim is to double its revenue year-on-year, Balkrishna added.
