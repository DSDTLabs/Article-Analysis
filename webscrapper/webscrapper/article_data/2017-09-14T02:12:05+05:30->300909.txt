GHAZIABAD: In its effort to keep the city clean, the   has introduced a   programme, wherein sanitary workers will be cleaning streets, especially in the prominent market areas, at night. According to the municipal commissioner, C M Singh, the logic behind the move is that sanitary workers will get enough time to clean, which otherwise becomes cumbersome during the morning.

 “It was felt for a long time that sanitary workers, who usually undertook sweeping jobs in the morning, didn’t get enough time, so we came up with the idea of ‘night sweeping’ in our internal meeting,” said Singh. “It also came up in the meeting that instead of employing our regular sanitary workers, we should outsource it to private agencies. When we floated the tender, there were many companies willing to take up the job. So the work was awarded to companies and ‘night sweeping’ is already being done in market places across the city,” Singh added.
 
 There are fifteen spots, mainly market places, which have been identified across five municipal zones. “Apart from sweeping the roads, the work also entails cleaning of drains, which is relatively easy because there is not much rush at night,” added Singh. “The sweeping work during winter will be begin at 8pm and will go on till 12am, while in summer it will be 9pm to 1am. The work will be done under the supervision of   appointed zonal officer,” Singh added.
 
 In addition to this, GMC has simultaneously introduced door-to-door civic waste collection work which will be chargeable.
