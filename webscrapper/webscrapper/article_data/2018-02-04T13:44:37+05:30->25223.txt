Panaji: The state government’s high-powered committee has accepted the recommendation of Goa   to increase its staff strength by 20%. The move is likely to be good news both for law enforcement in the state as well as for those aspiring to join the force. 

 A senior government officer said that following discussions last week, the committee discussed the   proposal and agreed to fill 1,228 police posts. Once the minutes of this meeting is prepared, it would be sent to the chief minister for approval, he said. 
 
 Once done, Goa police would be able to recruit 120 ministerial posts and five superintendents of police (SPs), 13 deputy SPs, 60 police inspectors (PIs), 300 police sub-inspectors (PSIs), 250 assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs), and 300 head constables and constables.
 
 Goa police currently has 6,051 personnel. They maintain law and order along with the  , which is 2,068-strong. A senior cop said that currently there are around 300 vacancies across levels in the Goa Police.
 
 “This is highly inadequate when it comes to important events in Goa," a senior police official had said. “Thus, we are compelled to requisition staff from neighbouring states and also from central forces.”
 
 Goa police, in its proposal, stated that the influx of migrants, tourists, and the state's rapid industrialization has resulted in an increase in organized crime, economic crimes, and cyber crimes. Also, the increasing number of vehicles has put a lot of pressure on the traffic units of Goa Police.
 
 The proposal also states that while over the past few years, a number of posts of constables have been created, there has been no proportionate increase in posts of head-constables, ASIs, PSIs, PIs, DySPs, and SPs.
