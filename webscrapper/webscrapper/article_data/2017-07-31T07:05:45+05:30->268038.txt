KOLKATA: A 42-year-old Trinamool Congress Bhangar II panchayat karmadakhya was shot on Sunday morning, stoking fresh tension in the area hit by land protests since January. Trinamool was quick to blame “Maoist elements“ disguised as protesters for the murder; the protesters, led by Left Front chairperson Biman Bose, blamed it on the raging infighting among TMC factions. The Leftists later took out a rally to protest the alleged land-grab attempts.

 According to sources, Asikur Rehman (also known as   locally), the karmadakhya, was returning after a meeting at Trinamool leader  's Uttar Gazipur home. Arabul is also the Bhangar-II gram panchayat sabhapati. Around 10.30am, Rehman along with Arabul and others were having a tea near Natunhaat. Arabul's son Hakibul -who said he's a witness -said: “Some unidentified people shot at them. The bullet hit Babu Sona on the head. Their real target was my father who luckily survived, ducking. We took him to the Jirengacha hospital; he died.“
 
 Hakibul alleged, “They (protesters) had been targeting our party leaders for the last couple of days. Only the night before, they had ransacked the home of panchayat member   in  , forcing him to flee with his family .“ While Arabul wasn't available for comment, party leader Kaisar Ahmed too resonated the same allegations. “This is the handiwork of Maoists who have taken refuge here. They are selectively targeting Trinamool leaders and fanning violence,“ he claimed.
 
 Baruipur police superintendent Arijit Sinha said: “It is too early to comment on the case. We have received some specific allegations.“
 
 No arrests were made when reports last came in.
