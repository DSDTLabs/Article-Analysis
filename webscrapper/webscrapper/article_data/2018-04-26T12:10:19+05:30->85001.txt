Director   is yet to collaborate with actor   for a film. Recently, the director revealed as to why he has not helmed any project with Mohanlal as the lead yet.

 Speaking about a misunderstanding caused between the two, Jayaraj reportedly said that after ‘Desadanam’, a film with a backdrop of rain was finalised with Mohanlal in the lead. However, due to some undisclosed personal issues, the director dropped the film despite locking songs, locations and costumes for the movie.
 
 Meanwhile, Mohanlal was vacationing with his family in  . He apparently cut short his trip and came back to shoot for the film only to know that the film has been chucked without informing him. After that, although the director approached the actor with various projects, he did not show any interest in them. In fact, Mohanlal reportedly kept the film’s script of   for three years before saying that he is not interested. The similar thing happened with Jayaraj's recent historical drama ‘Veeram’ also.
 
 The director reportedly still wishes to work with him and believes that it would be his best movie if he agrees to associate with him.
