 Vikram Chopra, a resident of Sector 43, had come to attend the “ladies sangeet” of his neighbour at Westwood with his two sons around 9.15pm. Rahul returned to the SUV (Toyota Fortuner) around 10.30pm. After 10 minutes, Rahul, heard someone knocking on the window and rolled down the glass. That is when a heavily-built man pulled out a gun and threatened Rahul. In the meantime, another man came from the other side and ordered Rahul to sit on the back seat. 
 
 One of the accused drove away the vehicle, with Rahul on the rear seat. Rahul said he jumped out of the vehicle after the accused had driven for over half a kilometre.
