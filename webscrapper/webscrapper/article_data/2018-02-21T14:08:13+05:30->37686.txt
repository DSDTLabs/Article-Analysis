NAGPUR: An Indigo Airlines flight from Lucknow to Hyderabad made an emergency landing at Nagpur   around 9am on Tuesday, after one of the patients fell unconscious on-board. The passenger — P Narsingh   — is a former chief commissioner of income tax.

 Rao was shifted to a private hospital from the airport. Hospital sources told TOI that Rao got unconscious in the flight for a few minutes due to which the diversion was made. He was stabilized and later admitted to the hospital. An MRI was done and the findings were normal. He is at present under observation and cardiologists are conducting investigation.
 
 Nagpur, due to is central location, is often used for such emergency landings for medical as well as technical reasons. In November last year, Spicejet’s   flight had made an emergency landing here after its cabin was filled with smoke.
