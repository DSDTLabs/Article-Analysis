LUCKNOW: The   became operational in the early hours of Sunday after remaining shut for almost 12 hours. A morning flight landed at   airport on Sunday. The airport had shut after reporting radar problems. Nearly 20 flights to and from the city were cancelled. 

 The   (AAI) had despatched teams from Delhi and Kanpur with the alternate data card that got corrupted on Sunday. 
 
 "We bought the part of instrument landing system (ILS) from Kanpur and Delhi and around 12.30am on Sunday, our engineering teams fixed the DVOR," said Lucknow airport director PK Srivastava. The DVOR had snapped around 4.30 pm on Saturday which led to cancellation of 20 flights to Lucknow. 
 
 Lucknow handles 90 schedule commercial flights daily, 45 arrivals and 45 departures, apart from "double digit" charter operations in this poll season.
 
 The AAI is studying how this problem can be avoided in future. Air   chief A K Dutta has sent technicians from Delhi to see how backup can be created for the data card that got corrupted on Saturday. "This data card is the same for both the original and the backup VOR. We will see how to have a different card for the back up," he said.
 
 Passengers arriving on different flights said it was around 1.30 am when an announcement was made about the departure of their flights for Lucknow. "There was no clear information as to when my flight will eventually leave for Lucknow. So I decided to wait at the airport and around 2am, I learnt about when my flight will take off for Lucknow," said   who arrived on the Delhi flight.
