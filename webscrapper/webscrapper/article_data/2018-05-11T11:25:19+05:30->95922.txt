MUZAFFARNAGAR: On a mundane afternoon of a sizzling summer day,   was given a treat, and “respect” also, so to say, at an unlikely place-- the district magistrate’s office. He was politely treated with jaggery and cold water by officials at the DM office in  , a district often referred to as the sugar bowl of the country due to abundant sugarcane production.
 
  After gulping the cold water and catching a deep breath, Kumar said, “Look, it is not about jaggery, it is about the respect, which common people hardly get in government offices. I felt respected when I got this kind of welcome in DM office.”
  
  In a welcome gesture, the administration has started offering jaggery and cold water to all those who visit the DM office for work.
  
  “Offering sweets to visitors has been our custom. We are doing nothing new. People come to our office from far flung areas in this scorching summer. Giving them cold water and jaggery if the least we can do,” said DM  .
  
  “People come here with their issues in this hot weather. If they get a warm welcome it will make the ties between the petitioners and administration better,” the DM said.
  
  Expressing his opinion, a lawyer, Firoz Rana, said, “It is a positive move. This is the first time that an IAS officer is paying more attention to the service of people.”
