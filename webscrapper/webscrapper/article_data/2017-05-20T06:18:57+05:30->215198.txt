PUNE: A   working with an   in Yerawada was shocked late on Tuesday night seeing a man peeping into the   she was using.

 The woman immediately raised an alarm and the man started running away. The security personnel and others nabbed him. All of them were shocked when they found that the man was none another but a housekeeping staffer working with the company.
 
 The woman on Thursday lodged a complaint against the suspect with the Yerawada police. “We have arrested 21-year-old Saurabh Vitkar of Shivajinagar for voyeurism,” said Balasaheb Gaikwad, an investigating officer of the case.
 
 This was the second incident in the past one month in which men were caught peeping inside the women’s washrooms in IT companies. Last month, a former housekeeping employee of another IT company was caught for a similar act. He was also taking photographs.
 
 Gaikwad said the Tuesday’s incident occurred around 8.30pm when the woman had gone to the washroom. “The suspect was in the men’s room. There is a gap between the wall and the roof separating the men’s and women’s washrooms,” Gaikwad adde.
 
 He said the suspect had climbed up the wall and peeped inside the women’s washroom. “When she noticed the man, she went out and raised the alarm,” Gaikwad said.
 
 The suspect jumped down and started running. But he was caught by the security guards and other employees of the firm. “The woman was so frightened that she was not ready to lodge the complaint initially,” Gaikwad said. “We have arrested the suspect under section 354 (C) (voyeurism) of the Indian Penal Code,” Gaikwad further said.
