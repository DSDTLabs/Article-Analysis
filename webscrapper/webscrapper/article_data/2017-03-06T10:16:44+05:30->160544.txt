The PM also blamed the SP government for “stalling Centrally funded projects”, including the ring road in Varanasi, Varanasi-Sultanpur and Varanasi-Gorakhpur highways. 

 Even the roads dug-up for laying cables were not repaired by the state government as it suspected that people would start giving credit of the works to BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, Modi said, quipping “Yahan bhi khuda hai, wahan bhi khuda hai, jahan nahin khuda wahan kal khudega,” to describe the state of dug-up roads.
 
 Talking about Varanasi, he said: “When tourists come to the city, everyone from tea shop owner to the hotel owner benefits. I want to bring 24x7 electricity to the city, adding “ My vision is clear. There should be no shortfall in irrigation for farmers, education for the children, income for the youth and in healthcare for the elderly.”
