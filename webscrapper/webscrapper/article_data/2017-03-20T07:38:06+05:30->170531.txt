HUBBALLI: Hundreds of people of Betageri town in   district were in for a shock on Saturday. They found worms in the rice supplied under the   government's Anna Bhagya scheme through a fair price shop in the town.

 No less than 50 families -comprising labourers, farmers and the underprivileged -complained that rice was infested with worms and pebbles, and found it difficult to sift them through. On learning about the incident, offi cials of the food and civil supplies department rushed to the shop and recalled the spoilt bags. They supplied grains afresh to all the families. Under Anna Bhagya scheme, each underserved family gets 515 kg of rice, depending on its size. This is not the first time such complaints have surfaced in the state.  , a resident of Betageri, bought provisions from the fair price shop (No. 46) and discovered live worms while cleaning the grains. “I checked with neighbours who also bought rice from the same shop. They confirmed the presence of worms and stones in rice,“ she added.
 
 Another resident, Parvati, said the quality of rice was bad, and she needed to clean it at least thrice in clear water.“In these times of crisis when we get water once a month, where do we get quality water,“ she said.
 
 According to residents, the entire lot of 125 quintals was of low quality and full of worms. Gadag's deputy director of food and civil supplies, Ashok Kalghatagi, told TOI: “On receiving complaints, we visited the shop and found the grains were of indifferent quality . We have since withdrawn the stock. Also, five bags of rice supplied from Gadag godown of the   had worms in them. This could have happened due to an increase in moisture.“
 
 The officer said his department will periodically assess the quality of grains at fair price shops, and promised action against licence-holder RM Putti for supplying rice with worms.
