AHMEDABAD: The imports of silver in Gujarat have gone up significantly in the past month or two, in expectation of a price rise. In February, it touched a 38-month high of 102 metric tonne (MT), an increase of nearly 27 times against the corresponding period last year, when imports stood at 3.55 MT. There has been a significant — near-600 times increase — in   month-on-month against 0.17 MT silver imports in January 2018.

 Bullion traders claim that the imports have increased multifolds, as stockists have begun purchases expecting a price rise. “Silver prices have remained constant for a long time now and there is a buzz in the industry expecting an increase in prices in the days to come. Investors and stockists are therefore looking actively at purchasing silver,” said Piyush Thakkar, a city-based bullion trader.
 
 Silver prices stood at Rs 38,150 per kg on Friday. The last time the imports were higher than this was in December 2014 when silver imports stood at 166.96 MT. Jewellers also feel that the high industrial demand and foreseen demand is also one of the reasons for buoyant investments in silver.
 
 “Silver has widespread industrial applications and therefore, ahead of an anticipated price rise, industrial units tend to procure silver in bulk. That apart, stockists and jewellers also tend to make routine purchases in line with their demand,” said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.
 
 Analysts also claim that of late, the equity market is relatively stagnant and there are hardly any returns, due to which the demand for precious metals has gone up.
 
 “The equity market is relatively stagnant these days. Therefore, the investor focus has shifted towards precious metals. Since silver prices have been more or less stable, there is a strong buzz in the market for the prices to go up and therefore, stockists and investors are making purchases. In fact, the demand for gold too has witnessed an increase,” said  , secretary,   (IBJA).
