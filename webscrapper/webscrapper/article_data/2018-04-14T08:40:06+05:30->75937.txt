CHANDIGARH:   government plans to introduce English as a subject in LKG and UKG at 119 of its schools as part of a pilot project, said state educaton minister   on Friday.

 At present, English is introduced in Class III at state-run government schools. 
 
 Sharma, who was speaking after paying tributes to the architect of India’s Constitution, B R Ambedkar, in Rewari on Friday, said teachers were being paid well and they were trained in all spheres. “The state government wants to ensure better level of education,” he added.
 
 He confirmed that they had received complaints of private schools overcharging in the garb of admission and building fund charges. “People have also complained of schools selling shoes, socks and books at the time of admission,” he said.
 
 Sharma said an advisory would be issued next week that no school would charge any fund in the name of admission and building fund. “The issue of affiliation given to such schools is being considered,” he said.
 
 Later, the minister also inspected   and shared his experiences with students, and donated Rs 5 lakh to the school.
