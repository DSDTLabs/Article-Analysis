MARGAO: A scrapyard situated in a residential area at Chandrawaddo in   was gutted in a fire on Tuesday afternoon. 

 Margao station fire officers Gil Souza and Ashok Parit led teams of fire personnel in dousing the flames and saving property worth nearly Rs 4 lakhs. Souza told TOI that the department received a distress call at around 2.23pm and two fire tenders were immediately rushed to the site to contain the blaze.
 
 “This scrapyard, leased to 35-year-old Mohammad Rafiq Johar, is located in a residential area without a valid   from the fire department. Fortunately, there were no casualties,” Souza said.
 
 While sources claimed that a CNG cylinder burst led to a fire, fire officials are investigating the cause, as they suspect fuel left in tanks of cars scattered in the scrapyard could have ignited the fire, that resulted in a loss of approximately Rs 40,000. 
 
 This fire incident once again highlights the issue of the danger posed to local residents as these scrapyards haven’t shifted from their present location to the outskirts of town. The   collector had assured to provide them with an alternative site at Verna, that hasn’t yet materialised.
