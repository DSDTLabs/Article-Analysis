NEW DELHI: A six-year-old boy was allegedly sodomised by three   at their ashram in central Delhi’s IP Estate over the past one month. The matter came to light on January 14 when a helper, Rahul, saw the boy crying and coaxed him into telling what had happened.

 In his statement to the police, the boy said that the accused men used to threaten him that they would throw him off the balcony if he told anyone about the incident. The boy was an orphan and had been adopted by one of the   six months ago when he was brought to the ashram by a member.
 
 Police said that four counsellors at the ashram spoke to the boy about the sexual assault. However, one of them was allegedly brutally thrashed by one of the accused. Two FIRs, one for the boy’s   under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the second for the counsellor’s thrashing, have been registered at IP Estate police station. A medical examination of the boy was conducted at Lok Nayak hospital.
 
 One of the accused, identified as Amarjeet, has been arrested while two others — Chandan and Mangal — are absconding. Police said they are raiding every possible hideout of the accused to arrest them.
 
 The helper told the police that he often saw the boy crying, but he never told him what had happened. 
 
 “He would ignore my questions. He always looked scared. After I kept asking him, he finally broke down and told me the truth on Saturday,” Rahul said.
 
 Rahul then informed the counsellors about how the trio had been abusing the boy. The counsellors then interacted with the child. 
 
 One of them also tried to question Chandan as to why the boy had been targeted. However, Chandan lost his temper and thrashed her after which they called the police.
