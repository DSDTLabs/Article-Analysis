NEW DELHI: Angered by his wife’s nagging, a 30-year-old man bludgeoned her to death on Wednesday night in south-east Delhi’s Sangam Vihar. He then stuffed her body into a sack and lugged it to Neb Sarai in  , from where it was discovered on Thursday. 

 After interrogating the accused, the cops said that when Nargis, 29, once again pestered her house-painter husband to find regular employment, an incensed Anish picked up a spade and hit his wife a number of times. His eight-year-old son tried to intervene, but Anish beat him and ordered him to lock himself and his two siblings inside a room. 
 
 After initially denying having killed his wife, Anish eventually confessed to the act. Chinmoy Biswal, DCP II (South), said, “Anish said they had regular quarrels, but yesterday he was particularly angered and had bludgeoned his wife with a spade.” The man told the cops that he planned to throw the body into a canal, but had left it near N Block in Neb Sarai when a pack of dogs chased him.
 
 Around 8 am on Thursday morning, a resident noticed the bloodied sack and informed the cops.
 
 Family members of Nargis alleged Anish regularly thrashed her for asking him to get proper employment. He worked as an itinerant painter and was reluctant to find a job that brought in regular income to supplement the money that Nargis earned as a worker with a private company. Anish hadn’t earned a penny in the past few months, and this was a constant trigger for arguments, including the one on Wednesday, a relative said. 
 
 “Nargis called my wife and told her about the fight, but we thought it was just a regular quarrel they always had,” said Javed, the murdered woman’s brother-in-law. “The cops detained Anish after we informed them about the phone call she had made.”
