Lucknow: After a gap of 12 years,   Students Union (LUSU) elections are likely to be held in August. LU has received a letter from the government directing all the state universities to hold elections in August this year.

 LUSU elections were last held in 2005. In 2012, the university had announced the students union elections, but they were stayed by the high court on a petition filed by a student leader.
 
 “The university has received the circular from the government in which, among the 27 points to improve the quality of education, the state universities have been directed to hold students union   in August this year. The vice-chancellors of all state universities will meet in June to discuss the issue,” said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh.
 
 The university is ready to hold the elections if the stay is vacated, said LU spokesperson NK Pandey.
 
 Last year, LU agreed to hold ‘direct elections’ in which students directly chose their representatives by way of secret ballot. The university had also written to the government requesting to direct the state administration to submit LU ‘categorization’ in the high court to get the stay vacated, he said. “If the stay is vacated by the court the university will hold elections and submit a new categorization for organising the elections,” he said. 
 
 Categorisation means putting up an education institution in a particular category depending on the format of the election it wants to adopt. The format could be direct or indirect.
 
 LUSU elections were not held in 2006 after the university introduced Lyngdoh committee recommendations as provided in the 2006 Supreme Court order. 
 
 In 2007, the students union elections were banned in all UP universities by the Mayawati government. Later, the ban was lifted but it was left to the universities to decide whether they wanted to hold elections. LU did not hold elections till 2011.
