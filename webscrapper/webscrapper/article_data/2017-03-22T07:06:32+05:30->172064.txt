DHARAMSHALA: Two BJP MPs from   on Tuesday met Union minister of state for civil aviation   and urged him to provide air services to Shimla.

 The two BJP MPs -   from Hamirpur and   from Shimla -- met Sinha with a representation to restart the Shimla aerodrome, Jubberhatti, which is lying unused for a considerable period now.
 
 "Shimla is one of the top hill stations of the country and the flight connectivity can boost the number of tourists visiting it," Thakur told Sinha while urging him to provide air link to the Himachal capital.
 
 He added though most of the tourists prefer roads to reach Shimla due to scenic surroundings, the air connectivity can reduce travel time and boost the visits by very busy people.
 
 Shimla's airport at Jubbarhatti, located 2,196 metres above sea-level, has been shut for the scheduled flights since September 6, 2012, affecting tourists and business travellers to the state.
 
 However, airports at Kullu and   in the state have been functioning. agencies
