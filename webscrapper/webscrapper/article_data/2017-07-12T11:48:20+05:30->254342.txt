AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Tuesday denied a 19-year-old rape survivor from a village near   to terminate her 26-week pregnancy. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP), which prohibits abortions beyond 20 weeks.

 Justice A J Desai refused permission for the abortion after the high court received a medical report stating that the gestational period was 26 weeks and four days. There was no abnormality detected and the girl shows no sign of any associated pregnancy complications. The doctors opined that the risk from abortion at this stage is higher than delivery at term.
 
 The girl had complained that she was “totally innocent and will have to face punishment for her entire life for the crime committed by someone else”. She urged the court to take a sympathetic approach in view of the peculiar set of facts. “The court may permit the petitioner to terminate her pregnancy and allow her to enjoy her right to life with respect in society, else the petitioner will have to suffer disgraceful and dishonoured attitude for her entire life for no fault of hers and it will ruin her future,” the petition read.
 
 During a hearing last week, the high court came down heavily on   at Vadodara for giving legal advice to the high court instead of submitting a medical report and opinion.
 
 Earlier, the high court denied permission to  in cases where pregnancy had advanced beyond 20 weeks. However, in one such case involving a 13-year-old, the   granted permission for abortion. Later, the high court also granted permission for abortion to minor rape survivors.
