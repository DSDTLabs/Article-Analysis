After spending 13 weeks in the   house, DU girl   has been evicted from the reality show. Nitibha, who is a graduate from  , says, "I think I was expecting this after spending only two weeks inside the house. I thought I’d get evicted before celebrities like Rahul Dev and Karan Mehra. But I am overwhelmed by the response that I have received on the show. I think my stay inside the house has been clean and non-controversial." She adds, "In the house, people get into fights by default. There is nothing you can do apart from your tasks. Your mind gets filled with negative thoughts. The environment is very stressful, that is why people tend to overreact."

 Talking about her equation with  , a commoner from Noida, Nitibha says, "Initially, I was under the impression that I might not get along with Manveer or Manu Punjabi because of their loud behaviour. But when I started spending time with them, I realized that they are good people. Manveer does cute little things for you, and I also started reciprocating. But after winning the ticket to the finale, he became confident that he might win the show, and I think because of the difference in our expectations, we had a fight. However, we respect each other. I think he’s one of the strongest contenders, and can win the show."
 
 Now, Nitibha plans to spend some time with her friends and family, who have stood by her throughout her Bigg Boss journey. "I will spend time and chill with my friends and family now," she says.
