Director   has directed a music video,  , to create awareness about the life of  . This song is composed by   and written by Vivek.Kiruthiga says that her work on this video has totally changed her opinion about transgenders.

 Talking about the music video, she says, 'I went to many transgender's home and had interactions to know more about them, through a city-based NGO. While working on the video, I understood their emotional feelings and the research I did changed my perception towards them. Earlier, when I saw them on roads, I used to sympathise with their way of living. But only when I spoke to them I realised that they are the most affected people in our society and that they need our support.They don't need our sympathy; all they want is empathy and the right to lead a dignified life.Through Sadhaiyai Meeri, I have tried to feature the truth of their lives. Twelve transgenders have acted in this song and all of them are first-time actors. The entire song was shot in the city .Santhosh Narayanan immediately agreed to work on the song in spite of his busy schedules.Though the tune is peppy , the visuals convey the required emotions. In fact, we wanted this contrast in tune and visuals.'
 
 This song will be released on Valentine's Day . Ask her why she chose for a Feb 14 release, she quickly replies, 'I feel they are the ones who are deprived of love in this society. They had been showered with love when they were kids. The moment their family came to know about them, they were abandoned. They grew up without proper care or love, which they actually need, and that's why we planned to release it on Valentine's Day .'
