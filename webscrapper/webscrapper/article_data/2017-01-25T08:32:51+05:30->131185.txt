BATHINDA: Punjab Congress chief   claimed on Tuesday that chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was behind terrorism in the state in the 1980s and was in touch with “extremist forces” during that time. 

 Addressing a rally in Bathinda’s Kot Shamir village, he said documents recently declassified by US external spying body CIA had revealed Badal’s connections. “The latest disclosures of a CIA report on ‘Punjab extremism’ has unmasked Badal, and made it clear that he is to be blamed for the spread of terrorism in Punjab,” he said.
 
 Sharpening his attack, Amarinder said he had tried to work with then SAD president  , then SGPC chief late Surjit Singh Barnala, and Badal to normalize the situation in the state. “Though Tohra and Barnala reached there, Badal, who might have known about the Army action, evaded reaching Amritsar. Badal had conveyed to the Union government that things were not in their hands and the Army operation was carried out,” he said. 
 
 Amarinder said Badal had at that time sided with extremists against the Punjab government to promote his personal fortunes. “He had sowrn on the Akal Takht that he would stop the Army at any cost, but stayed away when the crisis erupted,” he said. “Now Badal seems guilty of desecration. I will throw him in jail if he is found guilty of sacrilege. He played the communal card even earlier to promote his political interests. The latest incidents appeared to be an attempt by the Akalis to create communal polarization ahead of the assembly polls.”
