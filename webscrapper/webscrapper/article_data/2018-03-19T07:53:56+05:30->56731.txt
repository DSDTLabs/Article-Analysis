AHMEDABAD: A 38-year-old woman called   on Sunday morning and informed the staff that she was going to jump into the   and named a professor of   (GU) for   driving her to the extreme step.

 Avan from Ellisbridge police station soon reached the spot and rescued the woman. After getting to know her case, the police also called upon the GU’s acting registrar who assured police of action in the case within seven days.
 
 According to Ellisbridge police, the Sabarmati resident works as an assistant professor with a private university in the city. In 2012, she had registered as a PhD student. According to her application, the dean of her respective department, however, had threatened her that he would see to it that she doesn’t complete the course work within stipulated time and even allegedly demanded Rs 3 lakh to smoothen things. Meanwhile, her five year registration period got over.
 
 “She claimed that she had approached senior GU officials including the vice-chancellor over the issue but she did not get anything except promises. She had even given an application of complaint to GU police station for which she was called upon to write her answer on Sunday. When she reached the Gulbai Tekra police chowky, she did not find anyone and that was the last straw. She decided to end life and came to the bridge,” said an investigator.
 
 Piyush Patel, acting registrar of the GU, has given in his written reply to police that a committee meeting had taken place over the same issue and they will resolve the matter within seven days.
