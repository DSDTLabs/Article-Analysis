KOZHIKODE: It was supposed to be a freewheeling   between chief minister   and writer M Mukundan, which was expected to unravel the personality of the politician. However, it ended up as a ‘public meeting’ where Vijayan spoke about the culture of intolerance in the socio-cultural sphere.

 Addressing the gathering for nearly 25 minutes, Vijayan asserted that the intolerance of a section of people is a challenge to the world of literature and culture. “The condition is such that people outside literature command writers as to what they should write and what they should not, and they try to be the last word on literature,” he said, referring to the murders of activists and writers like M M Kalburgi, Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare. 
 
 On Friday evening, the chief minister’s office (CMO) said Vijayan was not keen on an interaction, said one of the organizers of Kerala Literature Festival. “In an interaction with audience participation, lots of questions are likely to be come up, something the CMO was not keen on. Though it would have given Vijayan an opportunity to express himself in a more informal manner, it did not happen,” said an organizer.
 
 Meanwhile, festival director   said the nature of the session was planned in advance and Vijayan was informed of the same. At the same time, Vijayan, who was delayed by over 45 minutes owing to other meetings, said that he did not know it was an interaction. Incidentally, the CMO programme chart had scheduled an hour for the meet at 10.30am.
 
 “Had it been a freewheeling friendly interaction, it would have been interesting, for which I had prepared many questions. But owing to time constraints and some unforeseen reasons, we had to redesign it, but it is great that the chief minister found time to attend the festival amid his busy schedule. We hope we would be able to have the interaction at the next edition,” said Mukundan.
