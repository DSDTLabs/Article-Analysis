NAGPUR : The   being held in the city has failed to generate the expected response this year. Participating farmers blame it on the one-month delay in organizing the fair. “People have already stocked the grains in April, which is the right time for annual purchase,” they say.

 The fair, going on behind the Agronomy department of the College of Agriculture near University library since Friday has been organized jointly by the   (ATMA), a state government body, and the Shendriya Shetmal Utpadak Sanstha (SSUS), a farmers’ organization.
 
 Ghanshyam Chopde of Srisudha farms said that people have already stocked the grains and the extreme heat is keeping them away from the fair. Echoing Chopde’s views,   from Waki Saoner, said, “A farmer’s job is to produce grains. Without adequate support from government, farmers cannot organize such fairs successfully,” he said.
 
 Ghanshyam Khandate, a farmer from Ganganer in Mouda district, said that every year he and others participating in the fair find it difficult to meet the demands of consumers. “At times, we would have to return to our villages to get the products demanded by the people,” he said.
 
 Dilip Kalmegh, vice-president of SSUS, admitted that the delay in organizing the fair was one of the major reasons for the poor response. “People generally purchase grains for the whole year during April. We have got good response every year in April. Next year, we will be prepared with a strategy and if need be organize it on our own,” he said. 
 
 Kalmegh has got support from Sahebrao Dhote, Ashok Verma, Prakash Hunde and other organizers of the body for planning a better fair next year.
 
 On the other hand, ATMA, which is in-charge of the fair, said the farmers’ organization had made their plans late this year, leading to delay in organizing the event.
