NEW DELHI: A 33-year-old mentally unstable man slept with his 65-year-old father's body for three days at their one-room house in outer Delhi's  . 

  Assuming his father was 'asleep', he did not inform any one about him and continued to live normally, until the stench spread in the neighbourhood and police were informed. 
 
  Police received a PCR call from the neighbours, following which a team was rushed to the spot. When they checked the house they found the man sitting next to his father's body. Police said the father,  , died nearly three days before his body was found. Singh and his son had been living there for last few years after his daughters were married. 
 
  The son told police that he thought Singh was asleep and he did not want to disturb him, so he sat alongside and had food. He said he even asked his father if he wants to eat. 
 
 Police were informed by the neighbours after stench surrounded the area. They suspect the man died a natural death since there were no marks on the body.
