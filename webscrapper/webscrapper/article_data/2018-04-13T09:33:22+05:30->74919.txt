MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Thursday granted bail to traffic inspector   who is lodged in jail in connection with the death of Usha of  , which was allegedly caused by him.

 When his bail petition came up for hearing before justice  , the petitioner’s counsel told the court that Kamaraj was innocent in the case, regarding which he had been in jail for more than a month. He would cooperate with the investigation.
 
 Following it, the court granted him bail. 
 
 It may be recalled that Usha and her husband D   were proceeding to Trichy from   on a two-wheeleron March 7 . The traffic police stopped them near the Thuvakudi toll plaza. But, Raja stopped his vehicle a few steps away and showed them the necessary documents. He then took a jibe at the traffic police’s handling of bike riders.
 
 Kamaraj, who heard this, followed the vehicle and reportedly abused Raja using filthy language besides kicking the bike. The woman fell from the vehicle under the impact and died. The Boiler Plant police had registered a case under Section 304 (2) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of IPC against the inspector.
 
 It is also noted that the husband also filed a case before the high court bench seeking CBCID probe into the case and the same is pending.
