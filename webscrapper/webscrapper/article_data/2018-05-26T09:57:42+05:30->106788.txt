PUDUCHERRY:   lieutenant governor   Bedi called on Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit in Chennai on Friday.

 Bedi invited him to the Union territory to address   here on   challenges in the areas of security and environment.
 
  She also insisted him to enlighten the officials on skills required to improve employment generation in the territory.
 
 Bedi said Purohit accepted her invitation and promised to visit Puducherry.

 The parties have been accusing Purohit of attempting to meddle in the administrative affairs of an elected government. 
 
 “With Hon’ble Governor of Tamil Nadu. Invited him to visit Puducherry and address officers on regional challenges in the areas of security, environment and required skills for enhanced employment generation. He has kindly accepted the same (sic),” she said in a group WhatsApp message.
