Coimbatore: City roads will soon become   free as the civic body has finalized the tenders to carry out patch work. The corporation has sanctioned Rs 7 crore for the purpose and the tenders would be opened on January 18.

 “We will issue work order within a week and complete the work by January-end,” said a senior corporation engineer.
 
 As per the tender documents, 72 works have been listed. “Each work comprises patch work of potholes in three to five streets. We have identified major roads damaged due to rain and they will be repaired on a priority basis. The other roads will be taken up in the second phase,” the officer said.
 
 Corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan said he had received several complaints regarding potholes and unmotorable roads. “We have finally got the amount sanctioned from the state government and will complete the work on a priority basis,” he said.
 
 Ashok Srinithi, a member of Paattali Makkall Katchi (PMK), and his team had conducted a survey across the city and photographed all the potholes. “We found 500 potholes in the city and requested senior officials to take action. Two youngsters have already lost their lives because of the official inaction,” he said.
 
 While the tenders have been called, the PMK man raised the question of officials compromising on the quality of patch work. “Roads are not laid as per norms. And as such, they get damaged after every rain. Let them complete the work and then we can assess it. I am sure that this patch work will be an eye-wash and the money will go to various officials as commission,” Ashok said.
 
 Other civic activists, meanwhile, called for a comprehensive quality control committee and wings in the corporation. 
 
 “Quality assessment is an important factor in civic infrastructure projects and the civic body should appoint a committee or create a separate wing for it,” said K Kathirmathiyon, secretary of the NGO Coimbatore Consumer Cause.
