HYDERABAD: Hailing   as the first crossover film in the country, Bollywood director and producer and Television host   said that it is high time that we stop segregating cinema into regions and start depicting every movie as `Indian Cinema'. “Bahubali really taught us the true meaning of this word `crossover'. The first crossover film in Indian cinema is actually Bahubali. We have to stop segregating our cinema into regions...We have to call it Indian cinema....We are a very tall industry and make some spectacular films and we have to be very proud of that and must start projecting, promoting and platforming these movies...“

 Karan Johar said while speaking at the   here on Saturday. On the digital wave sweeping the entertainment industry in India, the film maker, who was speaking on the theme `Reel to Real: The Business of Imagination', said that the only way the Indian film industry can combat the digital wave is by getting the content right.
 
 Stressing on the necessity of focusing on skills,   Johar said the country needs more academic institutions that teach the grass roots about film making.
 
 “It is my dream to open one...I learnt on the job, which is not the way to learn. We were just nepotistic students...we went because our fathers were prolific film makers and we got access to the sets and were fortunate. I was not trained to make K2H2 (Kuch Kuch Hota Hai) and I got lucky. But that was not the way to begin, I should have worked actually much harder,“ he said.
 
 “People say I am a product of nepotism. Yes, I am, but if I wouldn't have done anything with it, that would have been a problem.But what people take away from you is the tremendous sincerity hard work and passion that has been put in the craft,“ Karan added.
