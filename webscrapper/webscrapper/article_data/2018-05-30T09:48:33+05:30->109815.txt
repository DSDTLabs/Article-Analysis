 The rider of the bike was wearing a white shirt and a helmet, while the pillion rider had masked his face with a handkerchief and worn a cap to hide his identity. The police have requested the public to inform them if they came across the snatchers captured in the footage.
 
 The duo went on a spree snatching chains from four women on the streets within a span of three hours on Sunday morning. All their targets were elderly women who were unable to overpower them. The victims were identified as Vasundhara, 61, a resident of Samiyar Thottam, Seventh Avenue,  , Srimathi, 62, a resident of Coats Road in Pondy Bazaar, Fathima Beevi, 61, a resident of Vivekanandar Street, Ashok Nagar, and  , 67, from   who had come to Chennai to visit her relatives.
 
 "We have noted the registration number of the vehicle which was fake," said an investigating officer. "They seem to be previous offenders who were well-acquainted with the escape routes. Men from such gangs usually go on a spree targeting several victims in a single day," he said.
