TRICHY:   helpline 1098 has come of age. Its success can be gauged from the fact that children have become emboldened to approach it themselves; recently a 16-year-old bride from a rural area in Trichy district called up the helpline and asked the agency to save her from a marriage that her family was forcing her into. Such information received at the right time helped Childline prevent 53 child marriages last year. 

 It was in April 2016 that Childline got a call from a child in an interior village in  . She said her marriage was to be held that midnight and pleaded with the agency to rescue her. The girl said she would take her own life if the marriage was not stopped. 
 
  rushed to the village and stopped the marriage at the nick of the moment. 
 
 “We could reach the village only 15 minutes before the marriage time because it was an interior village. It was their custom to conduct the marriage at midnight. The girl was rescued despite the family’s objections. She has since resumed her studies,” coordinator of  , Trichy, S Thiyagarajan said. 
 
 Unlike previous years, information about child marriages is being conveyed by people because of increasing awareness about the helpline. “School teachers and college students play a very important role in giving such information.   to explain to them the consequences of child marriages have brought such a positive change,” said director of the organisation Dr J Godwin Prem Singh. He said about 41 school awareness programmes were organised during 2016-17. More than 100 child line volunteers have been identified and trained by Chlidline Nodal Organisation. 
 
 Childline Nodal organization on Saturday said that they prevented 53 child marriages in Trichy from April 2016 to till date though there were many cases going unreported. 
 
 Child marriages are still prevalent among a particular community in Thuraiyur, Manapparai and Vaiyampatti areas.
