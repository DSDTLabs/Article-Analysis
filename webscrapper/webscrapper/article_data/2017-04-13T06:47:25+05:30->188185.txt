KOLKATA: Cool moves by  , stirring performance by  , chartbusters on the console by local boy Kunal Bose and the will-he-won’t-he over Shah Rukh Khan… The opening ceremony at the Eden Gardens on Thursday has the making of a cliff-hanger.

 Home team Kolkata Knight Riders will take on Kings XI Punjab in their first match on the home ground on Thursday evening but before the first ball is bowled, the crowd will be treated to a Bolly extravaganza. This year, venues hosting their first game of the season are having opening ceremonies before the action kicks off.
 
 The gates will open at 5pm and fun will start from the word go. DJ Kunal will keep the crowds on their feet. “Apart from the team anthems, I will play many songs from Shah Rukh Khan’s movies because this is his home ground and the crowds will love it,” said Kunal.
 
 Shraddha Kapoor and Monali Thakur’s performance will start after 6pm and will feature a traditional dance segment representative of Kolkata. “Sharddha will dance to some of the recent hits in the club circuit while Monali will belt out her hit tracks. The idea is to build up the excitement,” said an official. The toss will take place at 7.30pm and the teams will walk out into the park at 7.55pm. KKR will walk into Eden gardens with one victory and one defeat under their belt.
 
 On Wednesday, the only question on everybody’s lips was if King Khan would be at the Eden Gardens to watch the opening ceremony. While there were murmurs that he will definitely show up because it was KKR’s first match on the home ground, nobody could confirm. “He is busy shooting for a movie. So we are not sure if he will come. His presence will lift the mood of the team and have the crowds on their feet,” said a source in KKR.
