BHOPAL: Yasodhara Raje Scindia, state minister for sports and youth welfare, has strongly denied that she and her sister, Rajasthan chief minister  , were seeking an appointment with BJP president   to complain against MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan about his comments against the Scindias at an election rally in Ater, as reported in TOI’s April 4 edition.

 “I have neither sought an appointment with my national president nor did I or my sister go to Delhi to meet him,” she told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 On her reported remark that she was ‘unable to take some initiatives as industries minister’, she pointed out that she was talking about her constituency, Shivpuri, and not about the entire state. “It’s wrong to interpret it that way. I was telling people in Shivpuri that although I tried very hard, I was unable to bring an industrial unit there because of the global meltdown in those days. To compensate for this, I held job fairs and vendor/buyer meets, which were very successful,” she said.
