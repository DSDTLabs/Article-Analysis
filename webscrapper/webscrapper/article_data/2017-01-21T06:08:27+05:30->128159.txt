Jaipur: Actor Rishi Kapoor said that   should not be named after politicians.

 The actor was speaking at the   (JLF) on Friday on the occasion of the release of his autobiography, ‘Khullam Khulla’. 
 
 There were eminent people like singer   and industrialist JRD Tata who had served the country better and deserved the honour.
 
 The veteran actor stirred a controversy last year by questioning the trend of naming roads, airports and railway stations after the Gandhi family. He had earlier been accused of being a BJP sympathizer.
 
 On Friday, he said he had no intension of joining politics – he remains an entertainer who speaks his mind.
 
 Asked about demonetization and its impact on Bollywood, he said, “Demonetisation has not affected Bollywood at all. Bollywood has no  . It is real estate and the black market that is, rightly, suffering.”
 
 The actor also spoke about his family and the legacy of his father and grandfather. He expressed happiness that at 64 years he continues to work in the film industry along with his son  .
 
 He also dwelt on the difficulty of performing to the heightened expectations of the audience after the 1973 film, ‘Bobby’. “It became difficult for me to compete with contemporary actors after that,” he said, adding that belonging to a family of thespians did not make things easier. “You are just as good as your last film.”
