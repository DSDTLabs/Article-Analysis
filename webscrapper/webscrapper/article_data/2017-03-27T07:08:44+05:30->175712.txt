NEW DELHI: Amid mounting uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's Asia policy, India and Singapore will review their ties next month when Singapore foreign minister   visits India.

 While there has been no official announcement yet, Balakrishnan is likely to visit India in the third week of April, government sources here said.
 
 Apart from helping India with urban solutions and smart cities, Singapore remains an increasingly significant partner for the government in defence, counter-terrorism and maritime security cooperation.
 
 Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj and Balakrishnan are expected to follow up on decisions taken by the the two governments during PM Narendra Modi's summit meeting with his counterpart Lee Hsien Loong in October last year.
 
 The meeting will come against the backdrop of the unpredictability which has come to mar US foreign policy since Trump took over as president. Both Singapore and India are waiting to see if there's any method, or coherent strategy at work in Trump's Asia policy, not least with regard to the US strategic and economic focus on the region under the Barack Obama administration.
 
 Singapore, in fact, was one of the strongest proponents of Trans-Pacific Partnership, Obama's flagship 12-nation trade deal around the Pacific, until it was abandoned by Trump immediately after he took control of the White House. Both India and Singapore are worried about the possibility of a dilution of the US Rebalance to Asia under Trump as they believe it could create a security vacuum in the region.
 
 Even as a steadfast and longstanding partner and friend of China, as Balakrishnan recently chose to put his country's ties with Beijing, Singapore has encouraged strong US military presence in the region. It has also exhorted India to increase its profile within the Asean region which remains central to Singapore's foreign policy .
