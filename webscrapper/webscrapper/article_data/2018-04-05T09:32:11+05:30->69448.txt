CHARMINAR: Drivers evacuated from the iconic taxi stand near the   railway station, last month, to make way for a multi-level parking complex for the metro station in its place, were on Wednesday, allotted a different place in the same area to continue their business. But while the inauguration of the stand did bring some relief, members of the taxi drivers association urged the authorities to earmark a permanent place near the railway station for them soon, as their earnings would take a serious hit otherwise .

 
  
 “I have been here for over 15 years. We pick up our customers from here every morning and this is my life now. While we are happy that they have allotted a temporary piece of land to us, we hope that the authorities come up with a permanent solution at the earliest,” said  . There were many like him who aired similar concerns.
 
 Trying to allay their fears, Nampally MLA,  , from the All India   (AIMIM) who visited the spot to inaugurate the new stand, spoke to the drivers and assured them of not being forced to evacuate from the new space.
 
 “The drivers are a closeknit community and have nowhere else to go if they are forced to vacate this place also. We will ensure that they are not robbed of their livelihood,” Hussain said.
 
 The taxi stand that was handed over to   (HMRL) was one of the first to come up in the erstwhile Hyderabad state after the Nampally railway station was built by the Nizams in 1907.
 
 “We will just manage in this new but smaller and temporary place for now. Development should not be done at the cost of our livelihoods.
 
 We are hoping that the MLA will keep his promise and see to it that are interests are protected,” a taxi driver said.
