BENGALURU: The   and JD(S) will fight the 2019   elections together to take on the BJP.

 
 Announcing the pre-poll alliance on Friday, AICC general secretary in charge of Karnataka, KC Venugopal, said: “We want to take this coalition to the next level by contesting the 2019 polls as allies. Senior leaders of both parties will decide on a seat-sharing formula in the coming days.”
 
 TOI had, in its Friday’s edition, reported that Congress and JD(S) may enter into a pre-poll pact for 2019.
 
 CM   said both parties have come together to fight the communal forces and this will pave the way for realizing the Mahaghatabandhan envisaged by many regional parties to take on BJP. “The bypoll results on Thursday have shown BJP can be defeated if like-minded parties come together. We will firm up a force against BJP for the Lok Sabha polls,” he said.
 
 Venugopal said the coalition government will complete its five-year term. “It is the wish of AICC president   that this coalition works in the larger interest of the nation,” he said.
