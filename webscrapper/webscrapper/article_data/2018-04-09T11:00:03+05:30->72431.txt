CHANDIGARH: With the opening of the double-lane project between Dappar and Chandigarh, the   railway division has started the process of chalking out a revised time table for the trains plying and departing from the Chandigarh railway station. Officials said the departure and arrival timings of trains at the station will be advanced by five to seven minutes as per the revised time table.

 
  
  
 
 Sources said the division is also planning to propose to divert four of the trains which are plying between Ludhiana and Mohali and extend the same till Chandigarh. Plan for increasing the frequency of trains between   and Ambala is also being considered.
 
 The Ambala railway division has already submitted the project of cutting down the travelling time of   trains by increasing the speed from 110 KMPH to 130 KMPH.
 
 Another project in pipeline is Tejas train with which the travelling time from Chandigarh to Delhi will be reduced to two hours and 55 minutes. The time table for the train has already been announced by the northern railway but the announcement of starting the same is yet to be made by the ministry.
 
 Dinesh Sharma, divisional railway manager at Ambala division, said the division is chalking out the revised time tables, which will be submitted to the higher authorities for a final nod.
 
 He added that the revised time table for the trains is usually finalised in the month of October but they are planning to make the changes in the local traffic soon. He said though the double-lane track has been opened for the traffic but due to some technical work, the division is completing some last minute works, which will soon be completed.
