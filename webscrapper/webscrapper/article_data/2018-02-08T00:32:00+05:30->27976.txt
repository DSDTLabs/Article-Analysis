Udhagamandalam: An elephant calf was found dead at a patta land near a reserve forest in Singara range in the north division of Nilgiris on Wednesday.

 Nilgiris forest officials were unable to conduct postmortem as three elephants stood guarding the carcass of the calf. 
 
 “The calf could be around one-and-a-half years old and might have died on Wednesday morning. It was found on land belonging to Nelson Estates near the reserve forest area in Bokkapuram beat in Singara range,” said forest range officer Kanthan. 
 
 “We could not ascertain the sex of the calf as two female elephants (one might be the mother) and a tusker were guarding the carcass since morning,” he said. “When we tried to go near the carcass, the elephants chased us for about 500 metres,” he added.
 
 Even as the tusker had left the spot in the evening, two other elephants stood there and were found in an agitated state, Kanthan said. “We have postponed the postmortem for Thursday. The elephants might leave the spot once smell starts emanating from the carcass,” he said.
