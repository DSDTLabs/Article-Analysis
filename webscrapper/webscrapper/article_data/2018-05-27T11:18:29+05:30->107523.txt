Coimbatore district's rural will police stations are to set up mini libraries soon with Minister for   and Rural Development S.P. Velumani, as a new project.

 The police stations purchased the books with the help of 36 Rotary clubs of Coimbatore and they will be dispatched to all the police stations in a few days, said senior officials. The mini libraries inside the police stations will be set up by the Rotary clubs under their jurisdiction. 
 
 The proposition is to build a library in all the 36 rural police stations, three women police stations and three traffic wing stations.
 
 According to Pa. Moorthy, Superintendent of Police (Rural), whose brainchild is the mini library project, the allocation of a library at a department can be a good way of promoting reading habits among police personnel as well as visitors.
