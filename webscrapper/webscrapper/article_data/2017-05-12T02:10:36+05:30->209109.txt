KANPUR: In a scene straight out of a   movie, a   was called off when a girl barged into the venue with a pistol, claiming that she was the “lover” of the groom and they were “secretly” married at a temple.

 The drama took place on Wednesday in Shivli area in   district just moments before Devendra Awasthi was to be solemnised with a girl. An eyewitness said the groom’s alleged lover made a sudden appearance during the “jaimal” ceremony and pointed the pistol at him and told him that he could not marry another woman as they were already a couple. “As the groom argued with her saying he did not even know her, she turned the pistol towards herself and threatened to shoot self,” said the guest. She also alleged that she was pregnant with Devendra’s child.
 
 The situation turned for the worse for Devendra when the bride refused to marry him, leading to a scuffle between the two sides. Elders intervened and finally the bride’s family called off the wedding.
 
 “Nearly 500 people had gathered. My cousin is very upset about what has happened but she did not want to marry a cheat,” said a relative of the bride.
 
 Another eyewitness said the bride’s family took back the cash and other valuables which it had given to the groom’s family. “The ex-girlfriend of Devendra, on being pacified by elders who suggested that she resolve the matter amicably, too returned home,” he said. Inspector Radha Mohan of Shivli told TOI, “Though no case has been registered, police are verifying the villagers’ version.”
