VISAKHAPATNAM: Confusion heightened in the port city on Wednesday as cops remained unsure if   president and Tollywood star   would participate in the proposed candlelight rally on   on Thursday.

 YSRCP supremo Jagan is likely to land in the port city at 4 pm on Thursday to participate in the candlelight rally. According to sources, he may be taken into custody at the airport itself. The same treatment would be applied to Pawan if he comes to Vizag. 
 
 Forces from across the state have been deployed since Tuesday night as chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is also expected to land in the city on Thursday to participate in the Partnership Summit that is to be held on January 27 and 28.
 
 Sources said all district SPs have been asked to stop youth from trying to reach Vizag to participate in the protest. However, several Pawan Kalyan fans had already reached the port city by Wednesday evening. 
 
 “If the cops lathi charge or fire smoke pellets to stop the youth, Pawan Kalyan would land in the evening. We will not utter a word during the protest. We will sit silently with tricolour flags in our hand and black ribbons around the mouth. As per   guidelines, people can stage protests without any arms or intention to create disturbance. We will observe a silent protest,” Jana Sena leader Vannemreddy Satish said. 
 
 Meanwhile, Jana Sena cadre met advocates at the district courts on Wednesday and students in Andhra University. They also distributed leaflets. The CPM and YSRCP had already extended its support to the youth. 
 
 Speaking to media persons here on Wednesday, police commissioner T Yoganand appealed to YSRCP leaders, Pawan Kalyan fans, students of various colleges and youth not to come to RK Beach on Republic Day and also during the Partnership Summit. He said the red alert sounded by the central intelligence agencies would be in force for 15 days before and after January 26.
