NEW DELHI: Delhi   (DJB) on Thursday took several decisions to tackle deaths due to manual cleaning of sewers as well as rising ammonia levels in   that has affected water supply.

 “The board has approved deployment of 200 specially-fabricated machines for cleaning of sewers in narrow lanes. This will also eliminate the practice of the manual scavenging as the machine is expected to reduce human involvement in cleaning sewers to a bare minimum,” said an official.
 
 To make sure that ammonia doesn’t get mixed with raw water, an additional 2,400mm line from the Delhi subbranch near   water treatment plant would be laid to reduce dependency on Yamuna for raw water.
 
 “Till this line is laid, a wall is being constructed between drain 6 and 8 in   in   to segregate industrial waste and raw water that flows through the canal to Delhi. The wall will stop ammonia getting mixed with raw water,” an official explained.
