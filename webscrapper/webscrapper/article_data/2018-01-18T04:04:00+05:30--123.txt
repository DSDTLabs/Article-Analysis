Vadodara: ‘Leap before you think’ seems to be the policy that the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has adopted while tackling slum rehabilitation projects in the city. 

 It is not just Sanjaynagar project in Warasiya but even the one in Sahakarnagar in Tandalja that is hardly making any headway.
 
 While alleged irregularities are the reason that Sanjaynagar is mired in a controversy, Sahakarnagar is seeing no progress because of a pond there. The pond is hardly around 4,000 square meters in surface area and is more like a large pit filled with sludge. But located in the centre of the site, it made progress difficult. Also, an order of the Gujarat high court has given strict directives to conserve water bodies.
 
 With the pond existing on a part of the land, the VMC was initially looking to ensure that the waterbody is kept intact and the contractor who was taken up the project is compensated for the loss of land. But it has now transpired that the pond is of much larger size in the records of the irrigation department.
 
 The end result is that no development has taken place on the site apart from that of clearing the debris that were left behind after the razing drive. The residents of the slums here are being paid rent so far. The civic body had razed 1,428 houses and 75 shops in early July at Sahakarnagar.
 
 “The matter is pending with the state government. Till a decision comes regarding it, we cannot resume work,” said an official. The official added that the state government had now clearly instructed that no slums should be razed without taking over the land.
