THANE: There was high drama in the district court on Friday when businessman Raj Kundra, an accused in a cheating case, said he would recover Rs 100 crore from the complainant. 

 Ravi Bhalotia, a vendor for a Kundra-promoted company and the complainant in the case, took exception to the remarks and with the help of his counsel,  , filed an affidavit in court saying the utterances of the accused were nothing short of a threat.
 
  Kundra and his actress wife, Shilpa Shetty, who accompanied him to court, are accused of cheating and breach of trust along with three persons associated with Best Deal TV (BDTV), a shopping platform. 
 
 Additional sessions judge   ordered that the five accused should give an undertaking in court that they would refrain from such acts.
 
  Counsel for the defence   also intervened and defused the situation. Nikam tendered an unconditional apology and told the court that there could be some "misunderstanding" as his client, Kundra, had sent a Rs 100 crore defamation notice to Bhalotia and he must have been referring to it. 
 
  Later in the day, Bhanushali said his client filed a non-cognizable (NC) complaint with the   police station saying Kundra had threatened him in open court. 
 
 The district court was packed to capacity, its corridors filled with visitors and even advocates eager to catch a glimpse of the actress and hear the proceedings. 
 
 The police had a difficult time controlling the swelling crowds and had to call in reinforcements. 
 
  The arguments by both the prosecution and the defence went on for well over three hours. The court is likely to pass its order on Saturday.
