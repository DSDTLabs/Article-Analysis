MUMBAI:   Chief Minister   today said his government was "sensitive and positive" towards the demands of   and tribals, who have marched from Nashik to Mumbai to draw the administration's attention towards their problems.

 Fadnavis was responding to a discussion in the Assembly, initiated by Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who lauded the farmers participating in the 'Kisan Long March' for their peaceful   while demanding a complete loan waiver and compensation for hailstorm and pink bollworm pest attack on crops.
 
 
 
 
 The   in South Mumbai turned into a sea of red this morning as thousands of farmers, carrying red flags, converged here after walking around 180 kms from the neighbouring Nashik district over the last six days.
 
 The farmers plan to surround the Assembly complex to press for their demands of an unconditional loan waiver, and transfer of forest land to tribal farmers who have been tilling it for years.
 
 The CPI(M)-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha is spearheading the protest.
 
 "They (the protesting farmers) reached the Azad Maidan early this morning from the K J Somaiya Ground in the eastern suburbs so that students appearing for their board exams are not hassled due to traffic jams. The Mumbaikars are also taking care of them," Vikhe Patil said in the House.
 
 He questioned the need for a ministerial committee to discuss the demands with leaders of the protesting farmers after they reached Mumbai.
 
 "Why couldn't the government talk to them before the march began from Nashik on March 6. Such hardships for tribals and farmers could have been avoided," Vikhe Patil said.
 
 NCP leader Ajit Pawar also appreciated the protesters for not causing hardships to students appearing for exams.
