NEW DELHI: A 40-year-old   of a   in northwest Delhi’s   was   on Saturday for allegedly   two   on several occasions. The accused was arrested after the students submitted their complaint to the school authority on Friday.

 Police said that the accused, Avadhesh Prajapati, a Hindi teacher, was charged under sections of molestation and Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. 
 
 The students told cops that Prajapati used to touch them inappropriately and used his blindness to shield the crime. 
 
 “The girls alleged that Prajapati used to call them for extra-classes and used to touch them inappropriately. When they confronted him, he started crying and asked them not to make a joke of his blindness,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Sources said that the school principal often got complaints regarding Prajapati’s behaviour, but took no steps against him. The accused, however, denied the charge of touching girls inappropriately. 
 
 Even after numerous confrontations in the past, Prajapati allegedly continued to molest his students. On Friday, however, the two girls confided in each other and decided to take up the matter with the school authority.
 
 “They discussed the matter with their parents and then with the school administration. After that, they approached the police and narrated their ordeal,” the police officer added. 
 
 DCP (northwest) Aslam Khan said that two cases have been registered against the teacher. “Some more students are coming forward with complaints. Further necessary legal action will be taken against the accused,” she said.
