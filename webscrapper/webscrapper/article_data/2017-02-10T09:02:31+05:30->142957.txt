AURANGABAD: At a time when educating girls was still a taboo, a few visionaries from the region dreamt something progressive and decided to open avenues of study for fairer sex. 

 After battling all odds, Sharda   came up in 1916 as Marathwadas first girls schools. It has continued to scale new heights during its illustrious 100 years journey, empowering girls through education along the way. 
 
 The school, which began with a strength of 21 students and one teacher, has flourished into one of the most reputed institutions in the state with total intake of 2,200 students and staff of more than 50. 
 
 As the centenary celebrations are lined up on February 13, veterans associated with the   (SBES), current parent organisation of Sharda Mandir Prashala, recalled the struggle they faced to let the school operate. 
 
  and Rajarampant Pol were the founding fathers of Sharda Mandir Prashala. “Opening a school for girls was a courageous move in those days considering the prevailing social conditions and mindset. Nevertheless, the duo had made up their minds,” SBES chairman Dinkar Borikar said.
 
 During a period between 1916 to 1940, Sharda Mandir Prashala served as the only institution offering education to girls studying beyond standard IV. 
 
 “The next ordeal for the founders was to facilitate education to girls up to matriculation. The then Hyderabad based rulers granted permission for the same only in 1946. Before that, the founders had approached Nagpur university and   to ensure girls study upto standard X and appear for reputed examination as Marathi medium school,” trustees said. 
 
 Many believe that it would not be an exaggeration to say that most of women from Aurangabad are alumni of Sharda Mandir Prashala; with the network spread across the globe.
