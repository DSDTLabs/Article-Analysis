 Prof Anil Mishra of the chemistry department has been appointed admission coordinator by the university for the second consecutive year. “Centralised admission will help the university maintain and retrieve uniform admission data of the students as and when required by the university. The application process for the new academic session will begin tentatively on March 20. The admission process will be in online mode,” said admission coordinator Anil Mishra. 
 
 According to vice chancellor S P Singh, the university this year will reduce number of courses offered in BA reducing the number of subject combinations. Keeping in mind the less scope of the BA course offered university had already removed BA in Social Work, Police Science and Rural Development which offers 60 seats in the admission committee meeting held last week. The number of seats in BCom self-finance will be increased this year given the rising demand for the course.
