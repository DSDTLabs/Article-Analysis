HYDERABAD: The central government is unlikely to accept the   government’s request to sanction 10 lakh more   gas connections as there are already excess   connections when compared to number of families in state.

 Under the Deepam scheme, the deposit for the LPG is paid by the state government to the oil companies. The gas regulator is also provided free. The   government has said that at least 10 lakh more Deepam connections are required to make Telangana a kerosene-free state.
 
 Sources told TOI that the data available with oil companies shows that numbers of domestic gas connections in state already in excess by 10 lakh. “There are 1.04 crore families in Telangana, but the data with oil companies shows 1.14 crore gas connections. In such a case, there is no possibility that the Centre will allot 10 lakh more connections to Telangana,” a source said.
 
 The TRS government’s target is to first make   kerosene free. In Greater Hyderabad alone, there are about one lakh families who still use kerosene supplied to them on subsidy by the government. “A survey has been taken up to weed out beneficiaries who already have LPG connections but have not declared them and are still availing the subsidy kerosene,” an official said.
