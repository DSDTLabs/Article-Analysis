Currently seen as Queen Olympia in the historical show ' ',   is all set to be seen in a completely different avatar at the same time. She will explore the comedy genre with  's ' ', in which she will be seen as  . She says, “The character belongs to a Punjabi family, where everyone is named Parminder; this leads to utter chaos when anyone calls out the name.”

 Ask Sameksha if she was nervous to share screen space with actors who are known for their impeccable comic timing and she replies, “I was a bit nervous in the beginning, but I am comfortable now. I try to observe them and adapt to their comic timings. The most challenging part was the accent, which is completely different from my character in 'Porus'. While one is Queen Olympia who has a Greek accent, this one is set in present times, with a complete Punjabi touch. Since I am a Punjabi, it was easier for me to play this role. It is also a challenge to switch from intense to comic and I wanted to test myself to see to what extent I can perform. The character I play in 'Khichdi' is relaxing. It is also rejuvenating to shoot for the show, as I enjoy each minute here.”
