KOLKATA: A Bhowanipore trader was found dead at his newly bought house in   on Monday morning. No external injury was found on Bhaboranjan Bhawal, 54, and the exact reason of death could be ascertain after the autopsy. Police have started investigating into the death but none was arrested till late Monday evening.

 According to Bhawal family members, he used to stay over at his Khalisakota Pally house in the weekend to engage labourers for construction works. “My father would visit the house every Saturday, stay two nights there and return to our   home on Monday. But we couldn’t get in touch with him since Sunday night. Our calls on his cellphone went unanswered. We contacted a relative who stays nearby to look into the matter,” said Amit Bhawal, the deceased’s son. 
 
 When Bhawal’s nephew Mithu, who lives at  , reached the house, he found the collapsible gate locked. He could see his uncle lying on the floor. Initially, he thought Bhawal was sleeping but when he did not respond to Mithu’s call, the latter raised an alarm. Neighbours rushed to the house and informed police. The cops prised open the gate and found Bhawal, barely clothed, dead. Two glasses and a wine bottle were found around him. The keys to the collapsible gate were later found in front of the house.
 
 “We have already initiated an unnatural death case. No external injury was found on the body. We are waiting for the autopsy report to know the exact cause of death,” said Dhrubajyoti Dey, DCP, zone II, Barrackpore commissionerate.
