Popular TV host   is thrilled about playing the female lead in the upcoming “dark comedy”  . “It’s an intriguing movie that is entirely content-driven. You can’t label any particular character as the hero or heroine. And I’m trying my hand at comedy for the first time. It’s a very challenging role with multiple shades,” says Anasuya. 

 With a cast full of comedians —  ,  ,  , Shakalaka Shankar, Siva Reddy, Ravi Babu, Tagubothu Ramesh, Mangli, Chitram Seenu, Kota Sankar Rao etc., — the actress will have to do something special to hold her own. But Anasuya sounds unfazed. “I just love being part of great stories. It doesn’t matter whether I’m part of an amazing ensemble cast; playing a solo lead; antagonist or whatever,” she says adding, “What’s most interesting about Sachindi Ra Gorre is that it will have an Oggu Katha (traditional folklore of Telangana) style of narration. Though I’m from Telangana, I never got to properly experience our ethnic folklore. In that sense, this film is a sort of eye-opener for me.”
 
 
 
 
 Sachindi Ra Gorre, jointly produced by Deepak Mukut, NM Pasha and associate producer Aparna Kitey under Soham Rockstar Entertainment, Entertainment Studio, is currently in shooting phase. And the filmmakers are pleased with the way their ‘hatke’ film is shaping up. “We are extremely lucky to have such an ensemble cast of talented actors. It’s a mad, eclectic, great bunch,” exudes producer Pasha. 
 
 Associate Producer Aparna Kitey adds, “This crime-comedy is going to be really unique and we are proud to be producing it.” Director Sridhar Reddy Yarva nods in agreement. “It’s been a challenging yet thoroughly entertaining journey for me. With an ensemble cast as big as this working together, every day of the shoot is unpredictable. As each of these experienced actors have a different style of working, they approach each scene differently and everyone works at their own pace. So it’s been fun all the way so far,” he says signing off.
