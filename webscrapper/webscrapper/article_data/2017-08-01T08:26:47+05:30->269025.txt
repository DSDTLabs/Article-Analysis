IMPHAL: Manipur deputy chief minister Y Joykumar Singh on Monday told the assembly that the death toll in the Imphal   has risen to five with three more persons succumbing to the toxic brew. 

 Raising a call attention motion during the ongoing budget session, legislator   criticized the government for its failure to curb large-scale availability of Distilled Indigenous Country (DIC) liquor in Manipur which is a dry state. He also demanded compensation for the victims' kin. 
 
 Among those who consumed the spurious country liquor at   in Imphal West, two died on Saturday. The other three succumbed to the toxic brew on Sunday and Monday. Of the 81 persons who were rushed to various hospitals in Imphal, 24 are still undergoing treatment, said Joykumar, who also holds the excise portfolio.
 
 Joykumar added that two liquor vendors have been arrested in connection with the incident and an FIR has been registered against them. Samples of the spurious liquor seized from the duo have been sent to the forensic laboratory for tests, the deputy CM said.
 
 Joining the motion, chief minister N Biren Singh said the only way to curb the menace is to amend the Manipur Liquor Prohibition Act, 1991,which allows distilling country liquor for religious and customary purposes. Taking advantage of this clause, people distill country liquor and the same is being made readily available in the state, he added. 
 
 Meghachandra said a large number of people are dying because of liquor-related ailments in the state.
