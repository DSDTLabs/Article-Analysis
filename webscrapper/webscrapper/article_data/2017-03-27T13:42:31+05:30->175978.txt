German writer Franz   had questioned a century ago in his short story ' ' if a man is free in the true sence as the "law is invisible" and the "court untouched". And now, news is that Kafka's iconic short story is adapted into a Hindi play titled ' '. 
 
 Directed by  , the play addresses "situations" in present day India which are similar to the early 20th century Europe. According to her, people in India are going thtough Kafkaesque experiences. 'Giraftari' attempts to pillory the system in a contemporary narrative, much like what Kafka's path-breaking literature did to the Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy in his time, reported PTI.
  
 "The bhaav (feelings) used by Kafka in every scene depicted the social order of the day. We have tried to simplify it and adapt to the local conditions here. This play is about a man's arrest and why he was arrested," she told PTI.
  
 Talking about adapting the 20th century play to the present situation in the country, she further told PTI, "In totality, nothing has changed in the modern world. The man was alienated from the society in the 1920s, 1930s, 1950s and even in 2017, the system, the law remain the same...people follow the system foolishly without logical conclusions." Pandey believes that   should have a purpose, and give the audience a "thought-provoking" experience.
  
 Kafka's 'The Trial' was written in 1914-15 and was originally titled 'Der Procez' in German. The short story has been a benchmark of 20th-century critical interpretation and subject experts have even considered it as a "mirror for any sectarian reading". Pandey took a year to write the play adaptation for which she referred to almost 40 books by Kafka to recreate his literary genius in a dramatic form.
