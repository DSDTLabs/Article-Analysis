It is after a long time that a rare butterfly has been spotted.

 Sharing the details about the butterfly   said, “I had first spotted it on March 26. But, at that time I could not click its picture for proper identification. I also waited for three more hours on March 26 hoping to catch a glimpse of the butterfly again, but it did not turn up. Next day (Tuesday) too, I could not spot it. But on Wednesday, when I and  , a fellow photographer visited the park, it obliged us with different poses comfortably. ”
 
 Talking about its origin he said, “It is generally found in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and   except the extreme Northwest. It can be seen flying in open areas before and after rain in the forested plains and hills. However, it has never been seen at Butterfly Park in Chandigarh before.”
 
 Chief conservator of forest and wildlife department, Chandigarh, Santosh Kumar said this is the outcome of the experiment that they have started in the Butterfly Park. “We have arranged supplementary nectar in the shape of over-ripened fruits. A special bed has been created wherein we have provided minerals, animal urine and dunk and bird droppings.”
 
 “It has been experienced that even as a lot of host plants facilitated breeding of butterflies, they did not stay there due to lack of nectar. Although we have provided a lot of flowering, all butterflies do not come for flowers alone,” he added.
