BHOPAL:   general secretary and former chief minister   on Thursday launched his three-month long   after offering puja at the Raja Ram temple in Orchha in Tikamgarh district. Digvijaya was accompanied by his wife Amrita Rai and senior state Congress leaders Rameshwar Neekhra and Mahesh Joshi. Singh was also joined by former Rajya Sabha MP Satyavrat Chaturvedi. 

 On the first day of the yatra, Digvijaya Singh launched a scathing attack on the   government. Speaking to reporters, Digvijaya Singh said, "The   government is behaving like the British Raj. It has purchased 17,000 police batons and sticks to beat the people. The administration has cordoned off Mandsaur and neighbouring areas before the June 6 farmers' congregation."
 
 He also claimed people of the state are angry with the 15 years of BJP rule. Petrol prices are constantly rising and farmers are not getting fair rate for their produce, while the government keeps making inflated claims about farmer welfare, he said.
 
 During his six-month Narmada Parikrama, Digvijaya Singh had announced that he would go on another yatra which would be political in nature. Earlier this month, he held a meeting with state Congress president Kamal Nath and AICC general secretary in-charge   with regard to the yatra. It was decided that Digvijaya would work for party unity and galvanise workers who have taken a backseat.
 
 The former chief minister has also been appointed chairman of the Congress coordination committee for the upcoming assembly elections. Now, with his 13-member committee, he will go from district to district and visit every assembly constituency mobilising the party's work force. The yatra will end on August 31.
