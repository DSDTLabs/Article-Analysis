Aurangabad: City based Vihang Special School will mark World Down Syndrome Day on Wednesday, by raising traditional ‘Gudhi’ on its premises, to raise awareness about the medical condition.

 Gudhi is a bright coloured silk cloth tied to the top of a long bamboo. It signifies the celebration of the Hindu Marathi New Year. The Gudhi will have a sock tied at the end of it as a symbol of the support for people with down syndrome.
 
 Vihang Special School works towards the integration, acceptability and rights of disabled people into mainstream society.
 
 Project head Aditi Shardul told TOI that the school through this initiative wants to address the misconceptions about the disease.
 
 She said, “The disease is often clubbed together with mental retardation. Though it is a form of mental retardation, it is very low in severity. People with the syndrome are cheerful and easier to deal with.”
 
 She added that the congenital disease allows for early intervention, as it can be detected during pregnancy.
