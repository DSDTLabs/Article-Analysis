Trichy: If unsafe pavements are a threat to pedestrians, mostly the senior citizens, the pavements that are in good condition but occupied by hawkers and encroached by traders also add to the woes of the pedestrians. “Several stretches of the pedestrian platforms in Thillai Nagar and Bharathidasan Salai are in good condition but encroachments by shops and hawkers push the pedestrians to walk on the main road,” D Prakash, a shopper in Thillai Nagar said.

 Apathy of the officials in maintaining the pedestrian pathways along Royals Road, which houses hospitals, ITeS firms, and shopping complexes, is no different.
 
 However, the multiple cavities and uncovered slabs of the platforms cause solid waste getting into it, leading to clogging of the drains. The clogged drain only adds up to the tasks of sanitary workers who had to fish out the solid waste and silts, wasting the manpower and time yet again. If the open drainage canals were properly covered with slabs, the burden of sanitary workers could be lessened, says city-based social activists and residents.
 
 The open drainage canals on Williams Road dotting central and state government offices, schools, besides a private multiplex has no proper pedestrian platforms to reach the offices and theatres from nearest bus stops. If the pedestrian platform was maintained well, solid waste would not get accumulated in the drainage canals, say sanitary workers. “It is hard to change the people’s behaviour, but the drainage canals on the Williams Road were covered, open urination and dumping of waste would come down,” a female sanitary worker said. Similarly, Sastri Road has several craters on pedestrian platforms through which people can take a look into the streams of drainage canal flowing beneath. However, one step into the crater without attention may land them in a hospital.
