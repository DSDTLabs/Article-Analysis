Coimbatore: The special investigation division of the Crime Branch-CID on Wednesday got the custody of the main accused in the Sasikumar murder case, A Mubarak, for two days.

 The CB-CID, which is investigating the case, had sought 14 days custody of Mubarak. When the plea came up before the district court here, the CB-CID officials told the judge, Christopher, that they had vital clues but they wanted to grill Mubarak to know the actual motive behind the murder of the Hindu Munnani spokesperson.
 
 But the judge observed that 14 days was a long time and raised doubts on the course of investigation by pointing out that the police had been investigating the case for nearly a year but were yet to ascertain the motive behind the murder.
 
 Meanwhile, Mubarak submitted a petition requesting the judge not to send him in police custody. When asked about it, Mubarak said he feared police torture. “I have not given them anything in writing and they do not have any evidence against me,” he told the court.
 
 After listening to the police and Mubarak for nearly an hour, the judge granted two-days police custody of Mubarak. The police were asked to produce him back in the court on January 5 by 5pm.
 
 C Sasikumar was brutally hacked to death by a four-member gang while he was returning home on his motorcycle near the Sakkara Vinayaga temple at Subramaniyampalayam village on September 22, 2016.
