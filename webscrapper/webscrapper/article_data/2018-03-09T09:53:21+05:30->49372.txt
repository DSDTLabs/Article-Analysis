VADODARA: The   (VMC) that is facing stiff resistance from environmentalists over Vishwamitri project has decided to change the name of the special purpose vehicle (SPV) that it had floated for the project. The SPV has been christened   (VRRCL) indicating that the project aimed at reviving the river and not merely developing a riverfront.

 VMC had been receiving series of representations regarding the environmental impact of the project on the river and its ecosystem. Activist Rohit Prajapati had also approached the   ( ) in 2016 and questioned the project. He had said that some activities proposed by VMC were illegal as it hadn’t taken environment clearance before commencing the project.
 
 In July 2016, the VMC sought to withdraw its environmental clearance application by stating that it wasn’t in order. The civic body had stated that the environment clearance application seemed to be made in haste and clearly at a premature stage. tnn
