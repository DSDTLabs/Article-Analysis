 President of the PSGPC Tara Singh, its former chief Bishan Singh and general secretary Gopal Singh Chawla raised provocative slogans against the Indian government. 
 
 Intelligence sources said that the   denied the Sikhs permission to hold anti-India demonstration at the Wagah border, which could have added to the ongoing bitterness between the two neighbouring nations.
 
 Sources said that the PSGPC held a demonstration on getting a nod from the   (ETPB), whose deputy secretary (shrines) Imran Gondal was also seen during the protest. 
 
 In a joint meeting held on June 30, the PSGPC and ETPB had decided to take up the issue regarding denial of pilgrimage to the Indian Sikhs for the martyrdom anniversary of fifth Sikh master Guru Arjan Dev and death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in Pakistan on June 8 and June 28, respectively.
 
 According to the Indian railway authorities, Pakistan didn't send the Sikh pilgrim special train on both occasions due to which the devotees couldn't travel to the neighbouring country. 
 
 "This is not something new. Pakistan government has always been trying to exploit the issues to create disturbance in India. This time they have deliberately made an issue by first not sending the Sikh pilgrimage special train and now blaming the Indian government for the same by inciting religious sentiments of gullible Pakistani Sikhs," said sources.
 
 Bishan told TOI, "Sikhs of Pakistan want liberal visa policy to visit India and pay obeisance at the Golden Temple and the five Takhts. Similarly, Indian Sikhs also want to pay obeisance at the historical gurdwaras in Pakistan. We have urged both governments to facilitate these visits by keeping politics aside."
