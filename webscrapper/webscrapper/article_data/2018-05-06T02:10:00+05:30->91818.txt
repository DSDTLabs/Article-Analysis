Tirupati: A post-graduate medical student sent a complaint to governor ESL Narasimhan on Saturday alleging that she was being sexually harassed by three doctors of Sri Venkateswara Medical College. 

 According to the student, she sent an email to the governor a month ago, giving a detailed account of the harassment she was facing by Dr P Ravi Kumar, head of the hospitalâ€™s paediatric department, Dr D Sasi Kumar and Dr A Kireeti. She claimed the governor replied to her mail and ordered an inquiry. 
 
 A five-member committee was formed by the college principal to probe the allegations. The student said in her latest letter that the college environment became worse after she filed the complaint. 
 
 Dr Ravi Kumar said the charges were lies and that he too has filed a complaint against the student.
