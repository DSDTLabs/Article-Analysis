Chandigarh: A Sector 23-based government school that came in the limelight after a Class VIII student was allegedly raped in the park behind it on August 15, is yet to learn any lessons. 

 According to Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights, no security arrangements have been made to date and boundary walls are still without railings, putting the security of children at risk. The commission came to a conclusion that school lacked security measures after carrying out a surprise inspection on Tuesday. During the inspection carried out on Tuesday, it found electricity switchboards broken, children’s schoolbags heavy, and sharp-edged furniture. The committee asked the school to devise a mechanism for decreasing the “bag load”.
 
 The school has also been advised to install a complaint boxes in the junior wing also and make them accessible to children. The team also inspected Shishu Niketan Senior Secondary School, Sector 22, and found that children there too were carrying heavy schoolbags and that more complaint boxes were required there.
 
 Members of the commission asked principals of both schools to check the complaint boxes every day. Students were found to be using auto-rickshaws for transportation, a violation of Safe Transportation Policy for Students (Straps). “These are also unsafe from the safety and security point of view. Some auto-rickshaw drivers were found inside the school building. This violation needs to be checked immediately,” said a member.
 
 At Shishu Niketan, the commission also pointed out to a passage to the basement running through the washrooms for nursery section.
