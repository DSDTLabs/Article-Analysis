 is all set to star in ‘Noor’ as well as a movie based on ‘Ittefaq’. Having been part of two action   in 2016, Sonakshi is now signing movies that have unique storylines and genres that she has not tried before. 

 Speaking to a daily, she said, “The first question I ask myself before signing a film now is how this character will challenge the actor within me. It all falls into place once I’ve managed to answer that question. I want to play characters that I’ve not essayed before, and be part of different movies. ‘Ittefaq’ is a fresh premise. The story demands the character to be played from two perspectives. I found that interesting. It’s not completely black or white. It has some grey areas too, and that’s what drew me towards this film. ‘Noor’ on the other hand, is the most relatable character I have played. That’s what I love about it. Sunil Sippy has approached this film so differently. Every role is demanding in its own way. The action films were physically demanding and the new movies challenged me to bring a certain reality to the characters. I am enjoying the variety of characters that I’m getting to portray.”
