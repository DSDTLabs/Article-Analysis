Tirunelveli:   currency with the face value of Rs 3 crore was seized from a gang by Tirunelveli city police. Investigations revealed that the gang had swindled the money from its owner after promising to get the money exchanged for new currency notes on commission basis.

 While the police arrested six people in connection with the case, six more, including the owner of the old currencies are being investigated. The arrested accused were identified as S Milton, 47, from Kottar, J Amarnath, 45, and his elder brother Peter Samkumar, 49, from James Town, P Devapichai, 41, from Nagercoil and D Selvanayagam, 60, from Sittuvilai from Kanyakumari district and C Jayapal, 52, from Alagiripuram in Melapalayam in Tirunelveli city.
 
 Police said the demonitised notes all in Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denomination belonged to Palraj from Alwarkurichi. He recently got Jayapal’s contact while he was trying to exchange the notes. 
 
 Palraj, who did not know what to do with the large amount of demonitised currency, immediately agreed to the opportunity provided by Jayapal, even though the latter demanded a large sum as commission for exchange. 
 
 Once they stuck a deal, Palraj took the money to Chidambaranagar, the place fixed for the exchange. But Jayapal, who was waiting there, had a different plan. He along with his gang members stole the old notes after attacking Palraj and escaped from the spot.
 
 However, the gang’s luck ran out as they were caught by police. Upon questioning, police came to know about the owner of the demonetised notes. He was also picked up for questioning. While the all six accused were lodged in prison , six more who were involved in the crime are being investigated.
