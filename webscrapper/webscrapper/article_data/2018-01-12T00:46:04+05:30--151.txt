Salem: Archaeologist ‘Aragalur’ Pon Venkatesan said the Kangeyamudaiyar community people were still living in Rayappanur village in Villupuram district. King Krishnadevarayar had built a fort at Kallanatham near Rayappanur and deployed Kangeyamudaiyar people to take care of the region. He nominated Samalu Madhu Eagamun Iyyan Kangeyan as the first ruler of the region, which was subsequently ruled by Tirumalai Athappa Nallathambi Kangeyan, Morur Athappa Immudi Nallathambi Kangeyan and Kumarasamy Kangeyan. Aragalur was their capital city. Their lineage is presently called Kangudaiyar Zameen and they enjoy first preference in all the local temples. They also have separate burial ground in the village. “We did not know when they came to this village. Now, we have a record in the form of stone inscription,” Pon Venkatesan said. They are, however, limited to four families headed by Muthu Jayarama Kangudaiyar, Muthurama Kangudaiyar, Muthukrishna Kangudaiyar and Muthu Venkatathira Kangudaiyar. Only Muthurama Kangudaiyar’s son Lakshmana Kangudaiyar lives in Rayappanur, while the remaining has migrated to various cities. Talking to TOI, Lakshmana Kangudaiyar said forefathers had done many developmental activities in the village. “They had constructed a government school and alms houses in the village several decades ago,” he said. He makes a living by selling milk. Lakshmana Kangudaiyar said they have preserved their forefathers’ weapons such as swords, spears, small knives and spiral knives at their house.
