Chandigarh: Taking cognizance of the sudden increase in the incidents of sexual offences against women in the region, the Punjab and   high court on Tuesday observed that such incidents are a sad reflection of society’s indifference towards victims of sex crimes.

 Justice Daya Chaudhary of the high court has taken cognizance of media reports regarding increase in the incidents of rapes in the region. The HC has also posed around 25 queries to Punjab and Haryana governments and Chandigarh administration for taking necessary steps by the authorities concerned to curb such incidents. The queries posed by the court includes reasons behind the sudden increase in sexual offences, problems faced by the police in dealing with complaints against women/girls, steps taken to use scientific methods in investigation of such cases, possibility of installation of CCTV cameras in public places, factors that are leading to sexual offences and deployment of counsellors or introduction of sex education in the school curriculum. 
 
 Justice Chaudhary referred the matter to the Chief Justice for taking appropriate action on the issue. Senior advocate V K Jindal and advocate Rakesh Gupta have been appointed as amicus curiae to assist the court on the issue.
 
 In her detailed order, Justice Chaudhary has observed that such incidents were occurring in spite of many stringent laws, which shock and dishearten the conscience of the general public. In some cases, which are reported in the newspaper, girls are in the age group of even less than 10 years while in some other cases girls are not only raped but subsequently murdered. “A rapist not only violates a victim’s privacy and personal integrity but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. A murderer destroys the physical body of the victim but a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female...,” she observed in her note referred to the chief justice for further action.
