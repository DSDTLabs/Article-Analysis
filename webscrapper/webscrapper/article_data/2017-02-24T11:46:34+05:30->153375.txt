RAJKOT: Tree butchers seem to be having a free run in the city, which already has a miserably less green cover (number of trees per 100 persons). 

 While chopping fully grown trees is not uncommon, a lady doctor made a valiant but a vain attempt to save a 15-year-old lush green tree from some miscreants on Thursday. After the miscreants refused to heed to her requests, the doctor finally approached some environment activists who took live pictures and videos of the tree being chopped as well as the vehicle in which it was transported. 
 
 “It was shocking that the miscreants chopped off such a huge tree and took their own time without any fear. We suspect that a gang is involved in chopping trees across the city illegally and they must be punished. Many shop owners and building owners chop trees which hide their showroom and civic body remains a mute spectator,” said  , an environment activist.
 
 The video and pictures were finally sent to the municipal commissioner   who has promised strict action against the culprits.
 
 “We have taken this matter seriously and I have ordered the concerned officer to lodge an FIR in this case. We will take action against the culprits,’’ Pani told TOI. 
 
 “It takes years for a one tree to grow but just a few minutes to chop off it. Authorities should act promptly lest our green cover goes on decreasing,” said  , a businessman, who lodged a complaint with RMC regarding chopping of the tree. 
 
 This is not an isolated incident. Chopping trees is common but the menace is often overlooked by the civic body.
 
 Rajkot, which has million plus population, has only 4.69% tree cover, which means there are only 10.69 trees per 100 persons which is far below than the expected as per 2015 census.
 
 “We knew that trees are being rampantly chopped off in the city but this was the solid proof,’’ said  , an environment consultant.
