MUMBAI: With the   of Parliament set to begin on February 1,   have written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi urging them to collaborate to bring about a law against   (Talaq-e-Bidat).

 Following the tabling of the Bill - The Muslim Women (Protection Of Rights On Marriage) Bill, 2017 in Parliament a quick consultation was held involving over 60,000 Muslim women in different states and a draft Bill prepared. 
 
 At a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan released a copy of the draft Bill which seeks imprisonment of the husband for a maximum of one year if he pronounces triple talaq. The Bill provides for arbitration mechanism within the community structures but any person or organisation who abets triple talaq shall be punished with imprisonment up to three years. 
 
 The draft Bill lays down elaborate procedure of divorce based on the talaq-e-ehsan method involving reconciliation, mediation and dialogue between the husband and wife over a minimum 90 days period. The responsibility of carrying out this procedure is on the husband.The wifeâ€™s right to maintenance support, guardianship of children as well as right to reside in marital home must be protected, states the draft Bill.
 
 The Muslim women's organisations have demanded that any pronouncement of talaq other than the Talaak-e-Ahsan shall be illegal. Khula, Mubarah should also be recognised as a method of divorce.
