VADODARA: A nine-year-old boy living near Kamlanagar pond on   went missing from his house on Thursday morning. The boy’s mother Bina   registered a complaint of kidnapping at Bapod police station on Saturday afternoon.

 Police said that the boy Karan, who was studying in class IV, mysteriously went missing from his house. His mother searched for him and did not register any complaint immediately since he had left his home in the past as well. However, he had returned on the next day. But when Karan did not turn up until Saturday morning and Vaghela too could not find him, she approached the police.
 
 A police official said that they went to Vaghela’s first husband Vikramsinh Chavda’s house in Dabhoi.   is Karan’s biological father but the couple got divorced due to Chavda’s drinking habit. “We did not find the boy there and even checked with Chavda’s neighbours. But they told us that he has drinking habit and there are very little chances that he would have abducted Karan,” the police official said.
 
 Police suspect that Karan may have gone to child care home, where he stayed briefly when his parents were getting separated.
