INDORE: Differing from his peers, farmer   stored 3,000 bags (1 bag weigh 60 kg) of potatoes in cold storage hoping for better prices while his fellow   exhausted the whole produce at dirt cheap prices.

 Banglewala from   village is now hoping to earn atleast Rs 5 per kg as profit on his produce as potato touched Rs 20 per kg in the market in over a month from Rs 10 per kg.
 
 He said, “I had stored potatoes in cold storage when prices were Rs 8 per kg. Now prices have gone up and I expect good profit on my produce. Last year farmers had to pay from their pockets to sell potatoes.”
 
 Like Banglewala, several potato farmers have heaved a sigh of relief after potato prices touched Rs 20 per kg in the market after trading as low as Rs 3 to Rs 4 per kg.
 
 Market experts said lower production and less availability of potatoes this season help in lifting prices. Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Dhar and Shajapur are the main potato growing belt in the region. 
 
 As per data from MP Cold Chain Industries Association, about 10 lakh MT of potatoes are stored at cold storages in Malwa region as against the capacity of 12 lakh MT.
 
 Association president   said, “Potatoes contributes about 60 to 70 per cent of storage volume of the cold storages. A lot of capacity was left unutilized this season because potato crop was less.”
 
 Potato production was down by over 20 per cent last season due to poor prices.
 
 Gandhi said, “Farmers will earn good profit on potatoes this year because prices have gone up and supply is less. Farmers will gradually take out their supply from cold storages now as they will wait for further hike in prices.”
 
 Market experts expect potato prices to touch Rs 25 per kg in a month.
