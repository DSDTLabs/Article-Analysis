Last year was undoubtedly one of  's successful phases in the last few decades. But the ongoing   is a blot on the landscape. While many of the top stars have remained silent,   clarified his   on the issue through his social networking page.

 While he started off congratulating the team behind Pulimurugan for breaking the Rs 100 crore barrier in Mollywood, the actor came straight to the point writing, "I don't believe that not even one A-class theatre has been activitely functioning in running in loss. In fact, like everyone in the industry, the theatre owners too have benefitted from the golden year that 2015-2016 was, I feel."
 
 The actor condemned the film exhibitors association for holding the industry hostage with their demands of increasing profit shares. "If you account for the tax rates etc and compare it with the money the   have shelled out to make a movie, it would be easier to understand why it's impractical to agree to such demands," he says.
 
 The actor also goes to explain that multiplexes have a higher ratio (50:50) when it comes to sharing profits per ticket, but that is because multiplexes have higher number of shows per day compared to A-class theatres, he points out.
 
 "How many A-class theatres provide the same facilites to a viewer that a multiplex does? ... If the argument is that there are theatres, then why don't the film exhibitors forum form a panel or board to rate the exisiting theatres and then decide the profit ratio?"
 
 Prithviraj, who just got back from a family vacation and joined the sets of Tiyaan, signs off by clarifying, "I stand with the producers and distributors in this issue. It's not because I am a producer or a distributor but because I am a film buff who is proud of the growth of the Malayalam film industry and want to ensure that our   is one of the supporting pillars of our State."
