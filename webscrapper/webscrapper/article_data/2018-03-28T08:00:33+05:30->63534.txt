NEW DELHI: After a stunning volte face on its China policy that made it seem like India was suddenly kowtowing to China, India is trying recalibrate its approach by restoring a political level of participation in a programme featuring the Dalai Lama in   this weekend.

 Culture minister Mahesh Sharma and   general secretary Ram Madhav will participate in the Dalai Lama’s “Thank you India” programme in   this coming weekend. This comes after a letter by foreign secretary   was sent out by the cabinet secretary to all arms of central and state governments asking government functionaries to stay away from these celebrations.
 
 Gokhale personally met Dalai Lama and the Sikyong (chief of the Central Tibetan Administration), Lobsang Sangay, to ask them to move the celebrations outside Delhi. Separately the government cancelled an event on India-China relations at the government-funded think tank, Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA). A global conference on Tibet scheduled for April was also put off. 
 
 Government sources reaffirmed there was “no change” in India’s China policy. But India wanted to end the poor optics that marked the last year souring India-China relations, which included Dalai Lama’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, India’s refusal to attend the OBOR summit, capped by the Doklam crisis.
 
 “None of the core issues have changed,” said sources.
 
 As both sides prepare for a Modi-Xi summit, in advance of the SCO summit in Qingdao in June, India wants to clear the air for a smooth landing.
 
  However, in the process, an over-zealous government succeeded in conveying a very different impression, prompting some criticism.
