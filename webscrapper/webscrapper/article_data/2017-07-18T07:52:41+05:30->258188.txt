CHENNAI: When the   started from   on Saturday at 6:50am, Railway Protection Force (RPF) constable K Shanmugham was standing at the end of the station,waiting for the train to move out of the station so he could take a tea break. However, just as the last few coaches of the train were passing, a man came running and tried to leap into one of the coaches. 

 He lost his balance and his lower body was being pulled into the gap between the coach and platform.
 
 Onlookers were shocked, as they were about to see a man being crushed on the rails in front of them. 
 
 The   threw his cap and notebook on the floor and ran to the coach, pulling the man out from the jaws of a painful death. It was over, in a matter of seconds. The man was safe. He didn’t suffer a scratch on his body, but was in a state of shock. 
 
 A one-minute video of the incident, recorded by a CCTV camera at the Egmore station, stands testimony to the quick thinking and   of Shanmugham. “I’ve seen worse; on many occasions we are able to get only mutilated bodies from under the train,” says Shanmugham, a native of Salem. The high-school pass-out has been a constable for 11 years.
 
 The guard meanwhile stopped the train after he noticing the commotion. Soon enough, when the train started, the man got up and went back into the coach. Shanmugham didn’t get a chance to get his name or other details. “He was so desperate to get into that train that he could have lost his life,” he said. Senior officials in RPF have taken note and will be recommending a reward for Shanmugham’s bravery and quick thinking, an official said.
