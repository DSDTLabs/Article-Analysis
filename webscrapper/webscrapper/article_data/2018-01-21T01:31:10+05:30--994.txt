NEW DELHI: The   of government schools are all set to get a new lease of life. A mega   has been organised to procure books for the libraries, starting Saturday and going on until February 2. The directorate of education is also starting a three-tier library system, which will bring a library to every pre-primary and primary class, separate libraries for class 6 to 10, and modernisation of existing libraries.

 In his budget speech, finance and education minister   proposed this three-tier system. For the  , Rs 17 crore has been earmarked, with another Rs 100 crore to work on current library infrastructure.
 
 With this, there is also a change in the procedure for procurement of books, “to bring more transparency in the process,” according to senior DoE officials. A public notice was issued in November last year inviting publishers to submit their books for different academic levels in government schools. A total of 1,921 publishers submitted their books under pre-primary, primary, secondary and senior secondary categories.
 
 The submitted books were scrutinised by library technical committee, and the selection process will be done online. Schools will place their demand on the module after which the publishers will supply books to respective schools. Payments will be released by the committee once the books are delivered.
 
 Until last year, schools used to buy books year after year on the basis of choice and need.
 
 Now, each school has since been allocated a separate fund for procurement of books for its library.
