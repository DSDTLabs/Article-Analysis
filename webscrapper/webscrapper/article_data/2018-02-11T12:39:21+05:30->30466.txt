BENGALURU: Residents of Indiranagar-HAL II Stage on Saturday staged a demonstration demanding a "ban on bars" in their area. 

 They alleged that a bar is coming up on site number 770 on Indiranagar 100 Feet Road and is within a distance of 100 feet from a church and a school. It's a clear violation of Rule 5 of the Karnataka Excise Licences 1967, which states no licence for sale of liquor shall be granted to a shop or premises within 100 metres from any religious or educational institution, they pointed out. 
 
 "The construction must be stopped as it is within 100-metre distance from   public school and  . It's going to be a tough fight for us to stop commercialization of the residential area, but we won't give up," said  , an RWA member from Indiranagar.
 
 "Just ahead of the protest, the builder had put in a bo ard that says 'Fine Dine restaurant' whereas the construction inside shows that boilers for a microbrewery is coming up," claimed Sn eha Nadhihal, president, BM Kaval RWA. The RWAs obtained details, including construction approval plan for the building through  , and said the site owner does not have trade licence from BBMP or licence from the excise department for the upcoming bar. 
 
 When asked by the residents as to why boilers are coming up if there are no plans for a bar, a representative from the construction site said the licence is yet to be obtained. "This is not within 100 feet distance from the school or church. Trade licence has not yet been obtained," he claimed. However, he refused to speak to the media.
 
  "As per the approved construction plan, there's provision for only six cars. If the bar comes up, where will the owner provide parking space for his customers? The project will hamper peace in the residential area," said  , a resident.
