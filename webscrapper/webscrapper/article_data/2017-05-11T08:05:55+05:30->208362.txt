BENGALURU: The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the lead civic agency for a city whose roads are dotted with potholes and waste piles, is weaving a dream of taxis in the air. This despite the civic agency pointing towards empty coffers to excuse itself from providing its citizens with a smooth road network and good pedestrian infrastructure.

 Cash-starved, and technologically-challenged, the Palike’s latest move makes for a great artists’ impression of Bengaluru streets, but experts say the agency’s plan to introduce   — a small automated vehicle built on single rail channels over pillars — is not feasible.
 
 While discussions about pod taxis/cars have been on from as early as 2010-11, the BBMP has suddenly gone gung-ho about the plan after a few US firms displayed the “potential of such a network” in a congested city.
 
 It has, in fact, identified six routes for the taxi network and is ready to call for Expression of Interest (EoI) from firms keen on implementing the project soon. Said BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad: “Some American companies have already presented their technologies and ability to implement a pod taxi network. Earlier, there weren’t many organizations that evinced interest to provide solutions such as this, but now we are hopeful of implementing this.”
 
 While the carrying capacity of each of these pods is about six persons, Manjunath, quoting one of the US firms that made a presentation to the BBMP, said: “In one hour, about 15,000 people can be transported on the select routes.”
 
 The firm selected will implement the project on a build, operate and transfer (BOT) model. The BBMP claims it won’t spend a single rupee as it plans to use space on road medians, which needs no fresh land acquisition.
 
 However, civic analysts and urban planners say that this is not a feasible idea in Bengaluru. “The roads are already narrow and taking away the medians will shrink the carriageway further. What is important is to provide last-mile connectivity to people which should be multi-directional and pod taxi corridor will be a rigid structure. Feeder buses, cabs and autorickshaws are the only modes of last-mile connectivity that’ll work in this city,” said civic expert V Ravichandar.
 
 He added that a lot of firms come with solutions in search of markets where they can sell them, but the government and its agencies don’t spend enough time weighing the pros and cons of such solutions.
 
 “If they keep announcing such half-baked solutions in public domain, it’ll make them look foolish. They should suggest evaluation of these ideas by expert agencies like the Centre for infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning (CiSTUP),” he added.
 
 Stating that Bengaluru is no Disneyland, Pawan Mulukutla, a mobility expert with World Resources Institute said: “Pod taxis do not have the capacity to bridge Bengaluru’s or any Indian city’s mobility gaps. They are perhaps an abuse of technology for mass transit. I think it will meet the same fate as that of Mumbai’s Mono Rail, where they are not able to plan the second phase of expanding the network.”
 
 Ashish Verma, a mobility scientist and a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, however, said that there is no doubt about the technology or its implementation. But the question was whether it would be worth the money spent. “Will it have the capacity? Pod taxis have been used in amusement parks and airport terminals globally. However, nowhere has it served as a mass-transit or last-mile connectivity mode and it won’t even in Bengaluru. Environmentally, it may be sustainable, but it’d be like a drop in the ocean if it’s about catering to the demand in transportation,” he added. 
 
 
 
 
 * In the 90s, the state government planned Elevated Light Rail Transit System (ELRTS) which has since been buried, even though the government collected money for it through fuel cess. While the Siddaramaiah government is trying to review LRT for certain congested parts of the  , there’s no confirmation on the project yet. 
 
 * The steel flyover proposed by BDA also met the same fate because it came under severe public scrutiny. The project had to be eventually called off, with the emergence of a dairy from MLC Govindraj. 
 
 * Pod taxis were first planned for Gurugram, after the solution popped up in a mobility conference. However, the Rs 850 crore project’s EoI was terminated due to poor response from companies. The NHAI had invited technical bids, but they couldn’t be opened as it wasn’t clear under what law and statute the new technology-based transport system could be made operational.
