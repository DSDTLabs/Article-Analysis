KOCHI: Schools in the city have found themselves in a tough spot in dealing with the state government's decision to penalize schools forcing students to speak English as per a provision in the ordinance passed on Monday, making it compulsory for them to speak  . 

 "The reason why we ask them to speak in English is because the students won't speak in English on their own, as they are comfortable speaking in Malayalam," said T P M Ibrahim Khan, president of Kerala   Management Association. Sacred Heart School principal, Father   said that the reason why some parents send their kids to a CBSE school is so that they can develop communicative skills in English. "If the state government were to penalize schools for encouraging that then the whole purpose will be defeated," he said.
 
 "I don't think that the government should penalize schools for suggesting that students should speak in English because the child will not learn the language till he or she speaks it. Students speak at home and outside the home in Malayalam. So while they are at school it is important that they train in the English language," said Joel K Jose, whose daughter studies in a private school in Kochi.
 
 Valson Thampu, the former principal of St Stephen's College, Delhi, said he supports the ordinance in principle. "I do not believe that the students should not be coerced in any way. If the students are being forced to speak in English then it is because the schools have failed to motivate the students," he said. He also warned that policy should not lead to aversion against the English language.
