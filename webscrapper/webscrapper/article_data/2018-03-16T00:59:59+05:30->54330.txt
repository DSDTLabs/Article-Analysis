Trichy: Bharathidasan University (BDU) has debarred an associate professor from guiding research scholars for life after he was found guilty of having indulged in malpractices. The decision against V Jayaraj, associate professor in the computer science department functioning on the BDUâ€™s Kajahmalai campus, was taken at a meeting of the university syndicate on Thursday based on prima facie evidence. 

 The syndicate has also entrusted the vice-chancellor with the job of taking disciplinary action against Jayaraj considering the seriousness of the crime. As reported, Jayaraj had created fictitious email IDs to pose as external examiner for his own research scholars. This was found during the viva voce of his research scholar a few days before the convocation held on February 21 after which the university withheld the PhD. 
 
 It was mandatory for the PhD thesis to be evaluated by an external examiner each from within and outside the country. But the professor, by creating dubious email IDs, decided to evaluate the PhD work of his own students which was unethical and criminal offence. 
 
 Confirming the decision, a syndicate member who attended the meeting said that many of the members called for stringent punishment so that such irregularities did not recur. Saying that there were possibilities of many such Jayarajs in the university, the syndicate member said that the vice-chancellor should order a wider probe.
