NAGPUR: Though campaigning for   elections ended at 5.30pm on Sunday evening, union minister   allegedly held a meeting of around 200 people in   on Monday morning.

 Gadkari’s alleged meeting violated Section 144 CrPC currently enforced in the city after the campaigning ended and prohibits gathering of more than five people at a public place. 
 
 Congress candidate Pranali Manmode’s husband Subhash alleged that Gadkari reached   at around 10.30am where BJP candidate and sitting corporator Sangeeta Girhe resides. He was accompanied by all four BJP candidates from Ward No 11. After introducing the candidates Bhushan Shingne, Sangeeta Girhe, Archana Pathak and ex-deputy mayor Sandeep Jadhav, Gadkari appealed to the residents to vote for them, Subhash alleged. His wife is also contesting from the ward where Gadkari addressed the gathering. 
 
 Gadkari violated the model code of conduct as he addressed a gathering of around 200 people and also used a sound system. The meeting was organized without any permission, Subhash alleged. 
 
 After a tipped off, TOI also visited Shrikrishna Nagar and found Gadkari addressing the gathering. 
 
 Congress has demanded action against BJP leader for violating the model code of conduct. The party alleged that Gadkari had clearly sought votes in the public meeting. Manmode stated he would file a written complaint with the State Election Commission. 
 
 Senior BJP leader Jaiprakash Gupta, however, told TOI Gadkari had not violated the model code. “He went there to meet senior citizens associated with temple trust in Shrikrishna Nagar. When he reached there, residents gathered on their own,” he explained. Gupta, who also accompanied the minister, admitted that Gadkari also visited Jaripatka area where he met party workers. 
 
 Additional commissioner (NMC) Ravindra Kumbhare said the election department had also got a tip off. “When the flying squad reached the place, our team found nothing,” he clarified.
