GURUGRAM: The Gurugram administration said on Thursday it will provide security to   after a group of right-wing activists, among them one claiming to be the local unit of the Shiv  , shut down a dozen meat sellers in the city.

 The local outfits had earlier gone to the district administration with a petition that meat shops be shut during   but were rebuffed. They decided to take the law into their own hands after that.
 
 Meat shops in areas such as Sector 9, Dundahera, Palam Vihar, near the   mosque, Rajiv Nagar, Sukhrali and Sikanderpur were targeted. Shopkeepers in these areas were also asked to keep trays of eggs away from view so that the sight of non-vegetarian food during the festivities “does not hurt any passerby”.
 
 “We had to close two of our meat shops in Wazirabad and in DLF-5. We did so out of fear because these people can even use violence to get their way,” said Tasim, who sells chicken and biryani. Another meat shop owner in Old Gurgaon said, “We respect religious sentiments but this is our livelihood. We are being asked to not earn our bread for 10 days. There has to be some other way.”
 
  Justifying the vigilantism, Rituraj, of the local ‘Sena’ outfit, said they would continue doing so. “It is inappropriate to hang meat outside shops where those on fast can see it. We will keep a vigil and ensure such shops are closed.” The other outfit that petitioned for closure of meat shops calls itself   Dal. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, “We received their letter and we acknowledged that. They requested to ban meat shops during Navratri. We considered the request and decided it’s a personal choice, so we will not act on any meat shops during Navtari. Also, we will not let anyone forcibly close these shops. If need be, we will provide security to the legal shops.”
