AHMEDABAD: Many restaurants and hotels in the city have stopped serving chicken dishes on their own, to safeguard their custom from   related complications, after the state government issued a bird flu alert on a 10-km radius around a poultry farm in Hathijan, Ahmedabad district. Some restaurants have begun serving chicken only on request.

 Mostly leading hotel chains across the city have taken the step. The impromptu precautionary move by hoteliers seems to have been taken keeping in mind the Vibrant   next week, when a host of international delegates will pour into the city.
 
 None of the hotels have yet received any official notification from the state health department or even the civic body for taking such action.
 
 “We have struck chicken off our menu. We would continue serving preparations made of lamb meat and fish, but not chicken. Chicken dishes will be served strictly on request,” said Niraj Sinha, GM, Pride Hotel.
 
 Some hotels have even stopped procuring chicken to avoid risks. “For past two days, we have stopped procuring chicken. Existing stocks of chicken and eggs are also being scrutinized by certified food testing agencies to avoid any complications,” said  , head chef, Hyatt Hotels.
 
 Singh said they have prepared a special menu comprising Indian, Gujarati and select Japanese dishes, sans chicken, for delegates of Japanese Consulate who would be putting up at their hotel.
 
 Many hotels across the city are following suit. “We have discontinued serving chicken on our buffet after news bird flu cases were reported in city. While our suppliers are FSSAI certified, we are thinking of discontinuing chicken dishes for the time being,” said  , general manager,   (IHG), Crowne Plaza – Ahmedabad.
 
 “For those who want chicken dishes on special request, we will make them sign a disclaimer citing the health warning, so that customers can make informed decisions,” Kaushik said.
