NAGPUR: One generally comes across   their success stories, talking about the recipe to success. But Mumbai-based investment professional and entrepreneur   believes that in reality, there is no single protocol that leads to a good startup. Instead, he chose to educate budding entrepreneurs and students on how the companies are valued from an investor’s point of view.

 TiE ‘City Chapter’, under the “Impact Series 2017”, on Saturday, organized a workshop with Keni at Chitnavis Centre,  . During the workshop, the candidates got to know what does valuation mean to your company, what the company is worth, and how does one measure his/her company’s growth.
 
 Keni said, “As an investor, we assume that if I am investing in 10 companies, at least six will not return my money back. So if I have given them Rs1 crore each and then Rs6 crore is completely wiped out.”
 
 “From rest of the four, two may or may not return the money. But the last two, if invested wisely, will give back good returns,” he said, adding that one can survive in this stream only by embracing uncertainty.
 
 “It’s attractive to hear people raising money through their start-ups. One needs to be well-versed with reality, but such a case is extremely rare. It’s tough to survive as a startup. It’s important to understand that when you want to fund your business, make sure its adequately funded, neither over-funded not underfunded,” he said.
 
 “The moment you get over-funded, you tend to get over ambitious. Such has been the case with all those   which have come and gone. They all went and raised crores and it’s all gone down the drain,” the entrepreneur said.
 
 “In the current scenario, it’s less of a risk to invest in a technology-based company. The only reason is high scalability. Even companies that are not directly related to the technology industry have a greater ability to scale. Customer acquisition, for example, through use of tools like digital advertising has become a lot easier,” he added.
