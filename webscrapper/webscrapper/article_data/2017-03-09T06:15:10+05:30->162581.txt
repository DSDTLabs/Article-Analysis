KOCHI: The   service 'Pappy' was stopped on Wednesday after the owner demanded payment of four month arrears, amounting to nearly Rs 6 lakh, by the  . Since there was no response on the part of the local body to settle the dispute, the owner raised an ultimatum that he would wait for one day and return to Alappuzha on Friday. 

 Babu Varghese, owner of the ferry said: "The local body owns me Rs 6 lakh from November. As per the agreement Kochi corporation should give me Rs 2.25 lakh every month. But from November onwards, they failed to give me full amount. Though I own the boat it is being operated by a third party. The corporation pays the boat operator but he gives me only Rs 1 lakh or Rs 1.5 lakh. So far no one has come forward to solve the issue".
 
 He threatened that he would take back Pappy to Alappuzha on Friday if the issue is not resolved. The local body took the barge of Babu Varghese on lease after 11 people were killed in an accident when a speeding fishing boat rammed into a passenger boat in   in 2015. The barge, which was converted into a ferry, plies between Fort Kochi and Vypeen.
 
 "We will discuss the issue with stakeholders on Thursday," said health standing committee chairperson Minimol V K.
 
 Pappy conducts service from 5am to 8.30pm. Varghese said the barge was used to transport harvest machines to the paddy lands.
 
  "A harvest machine weighs around four tonnes and a total of seven machines can be transported to paddy lands at a time in this barge. As the summer rain started, there is demand for barges to transport machines to the paddy fields for harvesting. I will wait 24 hours on Thursday to see if there is any initiative on part of Kochi corporation to restart the service after giving the arrears due to me," he said.
