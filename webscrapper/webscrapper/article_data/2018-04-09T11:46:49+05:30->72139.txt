VADODARA: The principal district court rejected bail plea of  , an accountant, who had allegedly murdered a cycle repairer   for having an affair with his mother in Wadi in November last year.

 Mayur, who worked in a private firm on Sant Kabir Road, was nabbed on November 8 by crime branch sleuths and is in jail after his police custody ended. On March 30, he filed a bail application in the court pleading that he is innocent.
 
 In response to his bail plea, the police submitted an affidavit opposing his bail. The cops informed the court that Mayur killed Kalpesh in front of his mother and since the key-witness is his mother there are possibilities that he will influence his mother. The affidavit also stated that if Mayur is released on bail, he may threaten the complainant who is also the wife of deceased and will not remain present during the ongoing trial.
 
 The court upheld the police’s arguments and turned down Mayur’s application.
 
 Mayur had killed Kalpesh by hitting him on his head with an iron pipe in crowded   vegetable market in Wadi area, where the victim and Mayur’s mother had met. He had immediately fled from the spot on his bike and had been absconding before being arrested.
