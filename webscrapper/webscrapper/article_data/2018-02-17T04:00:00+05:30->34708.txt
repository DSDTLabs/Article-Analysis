Mumbai:  , the country’s largest lodging outfit by revenue, plans to rejig the brands donned by its properties, monetise its vast real estate assets and ramp up its room portfolio, its newly appointed CEO said on Friday, in a move to revive the loss-making enterprise.

 Puneet Chhatwal, 53, who assumed charge three and half months ago, said in his first media briefing that he plans to start by refining the company’s brand architecture wherein 144 of its hotels will sport either the  ,   or   brand. Chhatwal’s initiative cans predecessor Rakesh Sarna’s single-brand strategy under which all hotels (except budget) were to be called Taj. 
 
 “The concept of one size fits all doesn’t work as we can’t have hotels of same sizes across geographies and neither can we have same tariffs across these locations. Multiple brands cater to diverse customers and price points,” he said. 
 
 A former   CEO, Chhatwal has been tasked with turning around Indian Hotels’ tumbling fortunes. Indian Hotels, a unit of the $100-billion-plus Tata Group, has been in the red for the last four fiscals, hit by declining room revenues, write-downs on investments and debts. Chhatwal has drawn a five-year plan to improve Indian Hotels’ operating margins from the current 17% to 25% by 2022. 
 
 He plans to do so by cutting down on operational costs, selling non-crore investments such as shares in ITDC and real estate assets including unprofitable hotels and about 100 residential apartments in Mumbai as well as expanding room portfolio from 16,992 to 24,000. The company is sitting on a land bank of 759 acres, of which it could look at monetising 6% (44 acres). The management said that the room expansion will be both in India and in select international regions such as Myanmar and Africa.
