NAGPUR:   have inched up a bit in the  , but the prices are still not enough to provide any respite to farmers.

 Tur whole, the raw material for making dal, is still being sold nearly Rs 1,000 below the   ( ) fixed at Rs 5,050 per quintal.
 
 The rates firmed by Rs 250 a quintal in the last fortnight with imported tur touching Rs 4,520 a quintal, while the domestic variety getting Rs 4,450 for a quintal. Market sources said this takes the wholesale rates of   at Rs 70 a kg as against Rs 65 two weeks ago.
 
 However, much change is not expected in the coming days, said traders. Tur dal is available at Rs 75-78 per kg in retail stores.
 
 Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Grains and Seeds Merchants Association, said rates of pulses across the board are down this year. “For example, moong dal rates have come down to Rs 55 a kg, it’s Rs 75 to 90 a kg for udad dal, with most of other varieties available below Rs 100 a kg in the bulk market,” Motwani said.
 
 Sources in the retail market said moong dal is available for Rs 72 to 76 a kg, while the price of udad dal is Rs100 and Rs 78 a kg of chana (chickpea).
 
 Market sources said the rates are down because of sharp increase in production as well as huge stocking by the government. The government is buying tur from overseas markets in large quantities which has created a huge buffer stock of the commodity.
 
 However, this has put farmers at a loss as they have to settle at a price even below the MSP, said an importer of pulses in the city.
