BENAULIM: Pointing out that the   was investing nearly Rs 500 crore to expand the Goa International Airport at Dabolim, Union minister for civil aviation   on Saturday asserted that there was no question of the civilian enclave at the Naval airbase at Dabolim being shut down after the new   turned operational.

 “Why is there this fear at all? Passenger traffic is growing at 23% per year nationally. In Goa, traffic is growing above national average at 30%. If the trend continues, do you want to choke Goa? If there is an opportunity of growth, why not take it? Who told you that we are going to shut down any airport,” Raju said on the sidelines of a civil aviation conference. Union civil aviation officials felt the state required another airport and the airports would benefit the two districts of Goa. “We think it is feasible to have two airports. Had it been not feasible, a private party would not come in to build a new airport,” an official said.
 
 Civil aviation secretary Rajiv Nayan Choubey also took pains to quell rumours that the airport at Dabolim would be closed once Mopa became operational. 
 
 “The growth is so much that there is financial and economical space for both the airports to function profitably. Imagine having a choice, which is the best thing for the airlines and consumers. There will be a healthy competition between GMR and AAI, which is good for the people of Goa, good for the airlines and good for consumers,” Choubey said.
 
 Raju said the Airports Authority of India was investing Rs 300-500 crore to expand the Goa International Airport, including the addition of a new taxiway to bring down runway congestion. “Nobody even thought of shutting it down,” Raju added.
