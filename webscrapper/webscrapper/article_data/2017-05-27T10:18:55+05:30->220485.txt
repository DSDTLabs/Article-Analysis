VIJAYAWADA: Taking strong objection to Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao's criticism of   president  , Union urban development minister M   on Friday said  's statements on financial assistance to Telangana have been grossly misunderstood. 

 Accusing KCR of making derogatory remarks against Shah,   told reporters that the central government has no intention to pick fights with state governments. Prime Minister Narendra   was committed to maintaining cordial relations with all states, he said. 
 
 "Shah only referred to funds granted by the Centre to Telangana. No one can deny that there is a phenomenal increase in fund flow to states from the Centre after NDA came to power," he claimed, adding that the Centre was giving equal importance to all states even if they were ruled by opposition parties. 
 
 Venkaiah credited party leaders and activists for making Thursday's booth-level committee meeting a grand success. He exhorted party activists to go on door-to-door visits and publicise the 'pro-people' programmes of the Modi government.
 
 On alliances, he told party workers not to bother about it now. "I request party workers to not get bogged down by debates over alliances. There is lot of time before elections. These decisions will be taken later. You (BJP workers) concentrate on attracting more and more voters to our party," Venkaiah said.
