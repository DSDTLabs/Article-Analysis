GURUGRAM: Students of   called off the strike against the varsity authorities for alleged lack of facilities at the campus on Saturday. The students took to the streets on March 3, alleging that the university was extorting money from them in the name of development fees, while all the claims it made about providing facilities like sports centre, swimming pool and gym turned out to be a ‘cruel joke’.

 The students decided to call off the strike after several meetings with the university administration and a meeting with DC   on Saturday. 
 
 The DC directed the university to fulfil all the students’ demands during the meeting, students said.
 
 “It is only after assurances from the DC that we called off the strike. He has assured us all our demands will be met in one week,” said Anil Gujjar, a student. “The university authorities were earlier dithering, but they later agreed. They conceded that all our demands are justified and pleaded us to call off the strike,” he added.
 
 According to reports, the DC personally pushed for this issue to be resolved. “The DC told the university that the students’ demands were justified, and if they didn’t oblige them at this point, the issue might spiral out of control, triggering similar protests in at least 15 universities operating in Gurgaon,” sources told TOI. 
 
 A representative for Ansal University said appropriate action had been taken on the points raised by the students, and the matter had been resolved.
