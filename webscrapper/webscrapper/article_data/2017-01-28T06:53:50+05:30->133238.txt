PUNE: State chief secretary   has issued orders to withdraw a letter sent by the   department to all the   as well as schools to remove photos of any deity from their offices. He has also issued a showcause notice to the officials who issued the letter to all departments on January 1.

 “An inquiry will be conducted as to how the letter was circulated without appropriate sanctions,” Kshatriya told TOI. The letter dated January 1 was issued on January 4 and reached all offices early this week.
 
 The letter drew severe flak from political parties on Friday, with   protesting the directive.
 
 “It was neither a government resolution, nor an order or a corrigendum. The letter should have been duly signed by the section officer, under secretary or the deputy secretary or higher officials. The letter was just forwarded by an official from the department. The letter is not even cleared by the appropriate authorioty. An inquiry would be initiated against the officials of the department on how the letter was circulated,” senior officials from the rural development office under minister   said.
 
 The letter was circulated to all the zilla parishads, panchayat samitis and gram panchayat offices as well as primary health centres, angandwadis and state-run schools. It left zilla parishads confused about the implementation and they, in turn, were waiting for a clarification as it was issued when most of them were going in for elections. 
 
 Pune zilla parishad, which received the order and was awaiting clarification, will now have to issue the same to the 6,000 schools in the district and more than 5,000 anganwadis.
