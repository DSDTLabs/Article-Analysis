Rohtak: Sudeep Kalkal, who is languishing in jail on the charges of involvement in arson of finance minister Capt Abhimanyu’s residence, has on Saturday got bail in case of issuing inflammatory speech at Sonipat stand in Rohtak, one of the three cases registered against him. 

 Jitender Hooda, counsel of Kalkal said that his client was booked in three different cases – arson of the minister’s residence in Rohtak, issuing inflammatory speech at Sonipat stand, and blocking national highway during February 2016 Jat agitation. On Saturday, Kalkal got bail in inflammatory speech case while he had got bail earlier in blocking national highway case. 
 
 However, Kalkal, who is currently in Jhajjar jail, would continue to be in judicial custody due to his involvement in the third case. Notably, Kalkal would be produced in Panchkula CBI court on Monday after 2016 violence case of the minister’s residence shifted to the CBI.
