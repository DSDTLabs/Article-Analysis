PATNA: Former   (U) MP   was on Tuesday sentenced to life imprisonment in connection with a 22-year-old Mashrakh MLA   Singh murder case.

 Ashok Singh, then MLA of Lalu Prasad’s party Janta Dal, was murdered at his official residence in Patna.
 
 The verdict was pronounced by 9th Additional District and Sessions Judge, Hazaribagh, Surendra Sharma. 
 
 The court also pronounced life imprisonment to Prabhunath’s brother Deenanath Singh and nephew Ritesh Singh.
 
 The judgement was pronounced through video-conferencing at the Hazaribagh jail, where all the three convicts have been lodged since last Thursday.
 
 In 1997, the Patna high court, after hearing a plea of the murdered MLA’s widow, had transferred the case to Hazaribagh district court from Patna district court.
 
 Prabhunath Singh is a former MLA from Mashrakh assembly constituency in Bihar and former Lok Sabha member from Maharajganj in Bihar. Prabhunath was very close to former PM Chandrashekhar.
