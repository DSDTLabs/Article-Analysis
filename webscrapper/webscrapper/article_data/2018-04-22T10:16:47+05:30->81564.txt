NAGPUR: Dismissing assumptions about   cholesterol (bad cholesterol) being unharmful, well-known interventional cardiologist from Pune Dr   said traditional wisdom that   holds true. “Unfortunately, social media posts have led to people believe that one must eat whatever one wishes. It is false,” he said.

 Dr Hiremath on Saturday was speaking on ‘Lipid Management’ at the two-day Central  . “Cholesterol is required for many body functions, but when excess, it creates a problem,” he said.
 
 “Liver produces 70 per cent of cholesterol. If the liver produces more or if it is not able to uptake excessive cholesterol, there will be high levels of LDL in the blood. Sugar and fatty foods contribute 30 per cent of LDL, which finally get converted into fats,” said Hiremath, adding that bad food habits and inherent problems both contribute to LDL. 
 
 If one’s LDL is high, it will result in heart, brain, kidney problems and atherosclerosis. “One has to be aware about a good diet — red meat, egg yolk is bad. Animal protein, cereals and legumes are good,” he said.
 
 The doctor further explained that sugar is worse than fats because it is responsible for blockages. “Dietary restriction would include controlled fat, controlled carbs and high protein. That is the diet all of us should be eating at all ages, whether young or old,” he said.
 
 Use of statins to reduce cholesterol levels is also advised, said Hiremath, calling it a miracle drug. He said, “If body is not able to reduce cholesterol, statin comes to the rescue. It has saved maximum lives, only after antibiotics.”
 
 Hiremath also spoke about a new discovery called PCSK9 inhibitor, a once-a-month injection which is twice as effective as statins. “Indian companies have come forward to make this intra-muscular injection, which brings down LDL levels dramatically,” he said.
