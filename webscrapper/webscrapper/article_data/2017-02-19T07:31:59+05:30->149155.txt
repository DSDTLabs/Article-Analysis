KERI: There is a rise in the illegal trade of the   tree and forest officials in Sattari, Bicholim, Ponda, and Pernem ranges have booked cases against those involved in the business.

 These trees are allowed to be felled in Goa and traders from the bordering villages of   in Maharashtra, generally, every year in the winter season, visit Goa to purchase these trees for illegal trade.
 
 Catechu, locally known as ‘kaath’, is extracted by boiling wood of the Khair tree in water and evaporating the resulting brew. This ‘kaath’ is used as a food additive, astringent, tannin and dye. Also, an ingredient manufactured from the khair’s heartwood is used in the preparation of pan supari.
 
 Forest divisional officer, Ponda, Pradip Shet Verenkar, said, “As the Khair tree is thorny and has less value in Goa, owners prefer to sell it at throwaway prices. While granting licenses, we put emphasis that the girth of the tree’s stem should be at least 75cm. The ‘kaath’ industry is of seasonal nature and contractors come to villages bordering Maharashtra for felling these trees, in spite of our best efforts to curtail activities of illegal tree felling.”
 
 Range forest officer, Keri, Girish Bailudkar, said “There is a Kaath processing unit in Aai, Dodamarg, in Maharashtra. Felled khair trees are brought into this area.”
