AHMEDABAD: After a string of video posts by military and   that made rounds on social media, yet another video of a sepoy surfaced on Tuesday. The jawan, a native of Junagadh, claimed that the sahayaks (assistants) given to officers are treated very badly. He further claimed that he went to the PM’s and the defence minister’s offices and also written to   but all he got were punishments.

 Jogidas Sindhav, identifying self as a sepoy with Army Medical Corps posted at Military Hospital, Ranikhet and a native of Maliya Hatina, Junagadh, begins with an apology for posting the video that might hurt sentiments of many but says that there is no other option.
 
 “While the armed forces are provided the lion’s share of the central government’s budget for well-being of jawans, the picture is different. In some of the units, meals are provided not for their nourishment but for their survival. The jawans get cheapest food and fruits,” claimed Sindhav.
 
 He said that a few officers still consider the sahayaks their slaves and constitution of army is so strong that none can raise voice. Sindhav said that he didn’t want to take social media route and had been to the PM’s and the defence minister’s offices on January 21 last year with his application. As there was no reply, he again tried luck on October 28. “When the answer came, it got followed by disciplinary action and inquiry. I was subjected to harassment for a year. I again went to Sena Bhavan on January 18 this year and wrote to Gen Rawat. It resulted in a charge-sheet for writing against officers. I have been punished two times and once my pay of 14 days was cut as fine,” said Sindhav.
