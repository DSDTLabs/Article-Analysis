CHENNAI: Three days after declaring the ‘flash strike’ by   transport workers as illegal, the   on Monday refused to vacate an interim stay on it. However, the first bench headed by Chief Justice Indira Banerjee made it clear that no striking worker can be terminated from service without the permission of the court. 

 Also, noting that in no way the worker could be denied their legitimate dues, particularly those already deducted from their wages, the bench recorded its expectation that the government would clear the dues immediately by taking a loan or through any other means. 
 
 The bench refused to accept the contentions of the trade unions that the strike was not a 'flash strike' and that due notices had been served. 
 
 The judges said, "None of the government authorities or even the transport minister are affected by the strike. Only the middle and poor class people who depend on public transport are affected. Most of them are daily wage workers. They lose a day's wage if they fail to report to work. Transport workers are entitled for their legitimate dues, but people at large cannot be put to inconvenience through such strikes. We can understand the plight of the transport workers, but we still maintain that such flash strikes cannot be tolerated. "
 
 Meanwhile, the strike by the workers unions entered the fifth day on Monday, affecting passengers across the state.
