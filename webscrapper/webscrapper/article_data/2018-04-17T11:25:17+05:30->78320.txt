BHUBANESWAR: The opposition on Monday created a ruckus in the assembly over sexual assault of two minor girls forcing speaker   to adjourn the house in the forenoon session. 

 Moments after the house reconvened for the day at 10.30 am, leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra expressed concern over the sexual assaults on the minors in   and Soro areas of Balasore district, both of which came to light on Sunday.
 
 He asked the speaker to suspend the question hour and allow discussion on the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. Narasingha sought a reply from chief minister   as minister in-charge of the home department on the issue.
 
 When the speaker did not allow,   members raised anti-Naveen slogans and jumped into the well of the house. Some of the MLAs tried to climb up the speaker's podium and snatch his microphone. Amat adjourned the house first till 11.30 pm. When the house reconvened for zero hour at 11.30 pm, the Congress members continued pressing for their demand for a discussion and a response from the chief minister. On failing to restore order, the speaker adjourned the house till 3pm.
 
 Speaking to reporters outside the assembly, Narasingha said the government has been indifferent to the serious issue of sexual assault on minors. "What can be more important for the government than curbing such heinous crimes? Unfortunately, the chief minister maintains a stoic silence on the issue," Narasingha said.
 
 Echoing similar views,   MLA Rabi Naik said the same reflects the Naveen government's attitude towards women. "They talk of honour for women and mothers. Is this honour?," he questioned.
 
 BJD spokesperson and MLA Samir Ranjan Dash said the concern of the opposition is just a publicity stunt. "The government has taken the crimes seriously and will ensure the culprits get the harshest of punishments according to law. But the opposition is doing precious little by not allowing the house to run," Dash said.
