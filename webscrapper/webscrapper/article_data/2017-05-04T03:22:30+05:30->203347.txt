NEW DELHI: The  's rush to mandate RFID tags in   without adequate infrastructure has meant that 73 lakh vehicles manufactured over the last couple of years carry dud tags which may need to be refixed or updated. These tags were meant to sail you through   as you could load cash in advance. 

 But the entire scheme has proved to be a non-starter as the government is only waking up to the problem now. For new vehicles, automobile dealers will have to install FasTags from August before these come out of the showrooms. Earlier there was a proposal to roll out the move from October but the Prime Minister's office wanted it to be advanced. 
 
 These tags using the same RFID technology allow vehicles to pass through toll plazas without waiting in the queue as the payment is made electronically. 
 
 Though the dud tags are not going to pinch your pocket since these cost around Rs 50 and a new fully loaded FasTag will cost nearly Rs 100, the owners will have to spend some time to install the new one or refix the old one.
 
 Sources said poor coordination between   and transport ministry had resulted in this chaos. The push for FasTags is aimed at reducing congestion at toll plazas. "Both the RFID tags installed by automobile manufacturers and the FastTags now being sold by six banks are technologically compatible. But the tags fixed by the automobile companies are virgin ones and there is no data. Hence, there is no option for top up or recharge. All these tags have to be assigned by an issuer bank, which has to give a specific serial number and then one can put advance cash in their tag," said an official.
 
 Under the new norms, the banks selling these FasTags will reach out to the automobile dealers, who will then offer buyers the option to procure the tags provided by different banks. Till now the banks have sold about 4.6 lakh FasTags across the country.
