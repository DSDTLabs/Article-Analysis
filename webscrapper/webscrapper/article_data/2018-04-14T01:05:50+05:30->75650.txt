Noida: Over 200 parents of students studying in Bal Bharati Public School, Sector 21, marched from the school premises to the city magistrate’s office in Sector 19 on Thursday, protesting against 28%   and the annual charges in the school which have almost been doubled since last year.

 Parents complained that the annual charges, which used to stand at Rs 5,500, till last year have been raised to Rs 10,000 from this session.
 
 “When I have to pay the annual charges as high as Rs 10,000, why should I pay for the security, maintenance of health and hygiene and IT? Isn’t it the duty of the school to provide all of this?,” asked a parent, whose both children study in the school.
 
 The parents handed over a memorandum to the magistrate asking him to help in roll back of fee hike and audit of the school’s accounts for the past five years and taking back the notices issued to parents.
 
 Divisional commissioner Prabhat Kumar said that parents can register a complaint with the joint director (education), Meerut or the commissioner, and the committee will look into the same. “If someone has paid the fees, it will have to be adjusted,” said Kumar.
 
 Meanwhile, a delegation of representatives of the parents’ association fighting against the 300% fee hike in the four government inter colleges met MLA Pankaj Singh and requested his intervention in roll back of fee. The meeting was held around 12.30pm at the BJP office in Sector 20.
 
 The parents said the MLA assured them to speak to the chairman and getting the fee hike rolled back. However, Prabhat Kumar said that there will be no decision to roll back the fee hike.
