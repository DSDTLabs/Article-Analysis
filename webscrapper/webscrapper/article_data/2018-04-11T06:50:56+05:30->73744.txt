HYDERABAD: In the event of a ‘terrorist attack’ in Hi-Tec City, National Security Guard ( ) commandos will take one hour to take up rescue operations after reaching the IT corridor by road from their newly-established Ibrahimpatnam centre. The reaction time will be much less if they were to reach Rajiv Gandhi International Airport from the regional centre which was inaugurated by Union home minister   on Tuesday. It will take 40 minutes to reach RGIA, while   will take 54 minutes.

 
  
  
 
 The elite commandos will land at the famed Birla mandir in 45 minutes. If the situation gets worse, commandos will be airlifted to grond zero to undertake anti-terror operations. This real-time data on reaction time of commandos was provided during a presentation to Rajnath by senior NSG officials. Applauding NSG as “better than the best” force that could counter any challenge, the minister said terrorism is a universal problem and posing new challenges. He said security forces must strengthen their technical knowhow to counter the challenges. “NSG is like Sudarshan Chakra. It has the capability to handle any terror situation. Terrorists must fear NSG,’’ the minister thundered.
 
 The NSG Hyderabad regional centre will not only cater to Telangana, but also to Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and   to deal with any eventuality, hostage crisis, hijacking and other situations.
 
 However, by moving the regional centre to Ibrahimpatnam, the reaction time of the commandos to sensitive locations in the city would be further delayed from the existing reaction time as they were operating from a temporary premises near   Centre, Secunderabad, which is closer to key locations. To overcome this, NSG top officials have decided to set up a Task Force at RGIA.
 
 Following the 26/11 Mumbai attack, the Union government had decided to set up NSG egional centres.
