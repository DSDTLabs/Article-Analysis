The   actress   took to her Instagram account to write a moving post about Smt.   Jayadeva Yogendra, who has been in the forefront of the yoga movement for the last four decades.

 
 The actress, popularly known as Dayaben, who recently made a comeback to the show after giving birth to her first child, posted a picture with the message that read as - It was truly a great honour to be there on the 80th birthday of Smt. Hansaji and seeking her blessings! She is the person who is the reason for what I am today. ‚ù§

 Disha Vakani was blessed with a baby girl in November last year. The actress, who had tied the knot with Mumbai-based Chartered Accountant Mayur Padia in November 2015, had been a busy bee with the shooting schedule throughout her pregnancy period. It's only on her doctor's advice that she took a break. It is said that her mother-in-law had reportedly accompanied her to the shoots to look after her.
 
 On Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, that has been on the air since 2008, Daya is shown as the mother of a 14-year-old boy (played by Raj Anadkat) and TV actor Dilip Joshi plays her husband, Jethalal Champaklal Gada.
