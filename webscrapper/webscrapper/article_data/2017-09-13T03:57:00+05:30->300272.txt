Panaji: As the process of identifying land for the Indian Institute of Technology ( ), Goa, is still on, the institute is investing over Rs 45 crore at its temporary campus at Goa Engineering College (GEC) at Farmagudi, to enable it to expand academic activities before the permanent campus is ready.

 When the IIT moves to its permanent campus, the infrastructure will be handed over to GEC, Goa IIT director Barada Kant Mishra told TOI.
 
 “We have written to the state government for its permission to construct a 640-capacity hostel. The construction is expected to begin this month. The hostel is being constructed at a cost of Rs 45 crore. Accomodation for around 300 students in the hostel is expected to be ready by end of June 2018,” said Mishra.
 
 He said that work on a one-floor lecture hall complex will also begin shortly. 
 
 “We are hoping we will stay here at least for three more years, after which the new infrastructure will be handed for the use of GEC. The state government and the GEC have been very cooperative. We are glad that our students are getting a campus experience at GEC, unlike some of the other new IITs, which are even running from military barracks,” said Mishra.
 
 IIT Goa is also going to reconstruct the badminton and basketball courts at its temporary campus for the institute’s students’ use at a cost of around Rs 40 lakh, Mishra said.
 
 Two bungalows have also been handed by GEC to IIT Goa, which will be renovated and utilised for student activity. In addition, GEC is also expected to hand over two more buildings to the IIT. “Once we are handed over land for our permanent campus, we plan to complete the construction in a record time of three years. The process of identifying land is on. Till it is finalised,” said Mishra.
