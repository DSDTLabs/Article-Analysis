CHENNAI: The killers figured they had buried all the evidence with the woman’s body at the bottom of a well in Mudichur, but the victim’s cellphone on Saturday led police to the culprits — almost 14 months after the crime.

 Investigators said Parveen Banu, who was 28 years old when two autorickshaw drivers from the southern suburbs killed her and hid the body with the assistance of a third in November 2016, was from Nadupalayam in Coimbatore district.
 
 “Banu left her husband   and their two children in their house in Velliannai in Karur district in 2015,” an investigating officer said. “Ilayaraja later lodged police complaint.”
 
 The Velliannai police, keeping tabs of Banu’s cellphone, found that she had moved to Chennai in 2016. They asked the Chennai police for help. But even as a police team got closer to tracking her down, the phone suddenly went dead.
 
 “Then, on Saturday night, the telecom service provider informed us that someone had turned on the phone,” the officer said. “We arrested autorickshaw drivers, Raja, 30, of Perungulathur,  , 28, of Irumbiliyur, and Kishore, 36, of Tambaram.”
 
 “The men said Banu befriended Raja shortly after she arrived in Chennai,” the officer said. “Through Raja, she met Kishore and Manickam, with whom she started a relationship.”
 
 “On November 8, 2017, Banu visited Manickam in a house in Maraimalai Nagar, while Raja was hiding in a room on the first floor,” he said. “Manickam and Banu had a fight that night and Raja got involved. The men strangled Banu and dumped her body in a well in Mudichur.”
 
 They informed Kishore about the   and he helped them hide the evidence by weighing down the body with a boulder to prevent it from surfacing.
 
 The men later led police to the well and officers recovered skeletal remains of the victim.
