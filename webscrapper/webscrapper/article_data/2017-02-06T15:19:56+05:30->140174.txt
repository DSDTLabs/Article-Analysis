JAIPUR: About 122 passengers and seven crew members had a close shave when their diverted flight making a ‘priority’ landing at   was hit by a bird mid-air leading to leakage of fuel Monday morning. The   flight-436 from Bhopal to Delhi took off at 7.45am and was to arrive in Delhi at 9.15am. However, it was diverted to Jaipur following low visibility at Delhi airport.

 By the time flight arrived at Jaipur the pilot alarmed the airport authorities here of fuel shortage. “The pilot requested for priority landing which was given to him immediately. The flight safely landed at 9.40am. After the flight landed it was noticed that fuel was leaking from the engine,” said Jaideep Singh, Jaipur airport director. Incidentally, the pilot while requesting for priority landing and communicating with ATC throughout the landing, did not mentioned about the bird hit.
 
 “Had he informed about the fuel leakage, the landing would have been made on an ‘Emergency’ basis,” said airport official, who noticed the spilling of fuel on the runway. Upon arrival the passengers were asked to deplane immediately to avert any untoward incident.
 
 Air India Jaipur's manager, Anil Verman confirmed that flight while on the way to Jaipur was hit by a bird and they came to know about the hit after the landing. “It is yet not known why the pilot was unaware of the mid-air hit. The technical team and equipment for repair arrived from Delhi in the afternoon. Repair work is in progress and damage will be repaired soon,” said Verman. 
 
 By afternoon all passengers were sent to Delhi vis coaches and flights depending upon their urgency. “A BJP MP from Madhya Pradesh along with 6-7 others passengers who requested urgency were rescheduled in another Bangalore-Delhi flight which was diverted to Jaipur due to the same reason. Majority of them boarded coaches to Delhi. Those who expressed no urgency were provided seats in our Jaipur-Delhi flight at 2.40pm,” said Verman.
