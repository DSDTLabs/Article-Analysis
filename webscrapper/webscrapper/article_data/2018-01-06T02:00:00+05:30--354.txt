PATNA: Senior Bihar police officials were tight-lipped on the theft of around 8kg of fuses for explosives from the parcel van of Himgiri Express in Patna on Wednesday night. The fuses, which were meant for use by Army, are yet to be recovered. 

 Keeping in mind the sensitivity of the case, massive raids were on at different locations in the district. Sources said no Army officials have contacted any police officer in the state in this connection.
 
 The fuses were loaded in the front parcel van of the train at Pathankot in Punjab for Howrah in West Bengal, but were stolen between Patna Junction and Patna Sahib station on Wednesday night after breaking open one of the two padlocks on the parcel van’s shutters.
 
 ADG (headquarters) S K Singhal said he would not comment before thorough probe. Sources said RPF officers had a meeting with senior Bihar police officers at the state police headquarters on Friday.
 
 RPF sources said by senior railway officials had handed over the operation of the entire parcel van to Lance Naik Kalu Ram and another Army personnel for security reasons at Firozpur in Punjab. They were travelling in a coach just behind the parcel van of the same train.
 
 “Even the keys of the padlocks were in their possession. The fuses were inside an iron trunk and nothing else was inside that van,” an RPF official said. He said if such a sensitive item was being transported, the authorities along the route should have been alerted, but none were informed.
 
 Railway ASP (Patna) Amritendu Shekhar Thakur said RPF has initiated an internal enquiry into the theft. “The statement of train’s guard Arjun Kumar was recorded. He said that RPF informed him about the broken parcel van seal at Jhajha in Jamui district. However, RPF personnel had spotted the broken seal at Patna Sahib station itself,” Thakur said.
 
 He said the Lance Naik lodged an FIR with the GRP at Howrah Junction. The case has been transferred to the GRP at Jhajha.
