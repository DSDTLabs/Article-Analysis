Panaji: The directorate of mines and geology (DMG) has received 35 applications from   dependents, including government institutions, to take up various works in mining areas under the Goa district mineral foundation (DMF). A senior   officer said the department’s priority would be to provide clean and safe drinking water to residents of the mining belt.

 The DMG received 35 applications, 18 from the north Goa mining belt and 17 from south Goa. “We will scrutinise the applications and take a decision,” the officer said, adding that the funds would be utilised in the talukas of Sanguem, Bicholim, Quepem, Sattari, and Dharbandora.
 
 DMG staff, along with members of the DMF committee, visited the mining belt to assess the requirement of mining dependents. A DMG officer said the team conducted a week-long inspection and found that clean and safe drinking water was the need of the hour. 
 
 DMG had invited applications from mining dependents to take up work in mining areas under DMF. Rs 180 crore has been collected from both districts under the fund, of which Rs 93 crore is from north Goa and Rs 86 crore from south Goa.
 
  The fund can be utilised for a variety of works — restoring the ecology damaged by mining, tree plantation, providing healthcare and education, building a road/bridge network, desilting water bodies, installing pollution control devices and sewage treatment plants, providing assistance in agriculture, horticulture, dairy farming, etc.
 
 Recently, after the high court of Bombay at Goa expressed shock and concern over the state’s non-utilisation of mining funds, the DMG asked panchayats to create awareness about the fund, so that projects could be taken up.
