HYDERABAD: Telangana farmers, who overwhelmingly went for  , maize and   crops in the 2016-17 crop seasons, are an unhappy lot with few takers for their produce. Just like Kharif season, the Rabi season too is witnessing farmers clamouring for remunerative prices for some crops and implementation of minimum support price for others.

 One of the reasons for the increased production of pulses and chillis along with maize and soya was the call by the government to refrain from growing cotton in the Kharif season. The government had said that the demand for cotton in the international markets was set to fall and that farmers would have to bear the brunt with no takers for their produce. They also said that cotton farming mainly depends on rain or ground water, both of which were in short supply.
 
 A year down the line, there appears to be a rethink in government circles over the impact of their advice. It is learnt that a section of the party leaders are worried over disgruntlement among farmers for lack of remunerative prices for their produce. An increasing number of farmers are protesting for the implementation of minimum support price in the case of red gram and remunerative returns for chilli crops. 
 
 The refrain doing the rounds of the party is that the government should have stayed away from telling farmers what to plant, especially without putting in place a support mechanism to absorb the increased yields of other crops. “Unless we somehow manage to quickly calm the farming community, the anger will stay and spread. This is something we cannot afford,” a party leader said.
 
 Farmers are complaining that they are not receiving the promised Rs 5,050 minimum support price for redgram and have been forced to sell for Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,200 per quintal. Chilli farmers are demanding Rs 10,000 per quintal against the Rs 5,000 they are being offered for the best quality chillies.
