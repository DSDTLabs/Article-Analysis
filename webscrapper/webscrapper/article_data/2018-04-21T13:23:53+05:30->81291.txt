HYDERABAD: The Telangana Pradesh   Committee's Election Commission coordination committee chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy, along with party MLAs Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and SA  , met Chief Election Commissioner of India O P Rawat in New Delhi on Friday and requested him to write to the Telangana   Speaker S Madhusudhana Chary to restore the membership of the two MLAs keeping in view the   judgment that revoked the expulsions. 

 Senior advocate Jandhyala Ravi Shankar, who was part of the Telangana Congress delegation, explained to the   the details of the judgment and how the membership of the two MLAs stand automatically restored following the court order.
 
 They also urged the ECI to set aside the Telangana government's request to issue election notification in the two Assembly constituencies represented by Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and Sampath Kumar, which were declared vacant after the Assembly passed the disqualification motion.
 
 The Congress also urged the ECI to look into amending relevant provisions in the election rules to ensure that ruling parties do not make it a habit to expel MLAs just before elections to   membership. The two Congress MLAs were expelled just before Rajya Sabha elections, making them ineligible to vote.
