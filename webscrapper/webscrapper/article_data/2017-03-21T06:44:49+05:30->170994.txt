JAISALMER: Acting on the state governmentâ€™s proposal, Centre has initiated the efforts to start air-services in Jaisalmer. Union minister for civil aviation, P   on Monday informed the Parliament that Jaislamer will be connected with other cities under regional connectivity scheme. 

 Replying to question raised by Jaislamer-Barmer MP Sonaram Choudhary, Raju said central government under regional connectivity scheme has plans to start air services to 70 places and efforts are being made to start service in Jaisalmer too. 
 
 He however added that   and its associate Alliance Air have no plans air-services in Jaisalmer. 
 
 Choudhary said that there has been a constant delay in starting air services here even though the airport has been ready since past four years. On February 20, Supreme Airlines had announced to start air services but   did not give its clearance as the company did not fulfil security and other necessary requirements.
 
 The MP said that Jaisalmer is popular among tourists and lakhs come here, however, a large number are unable to come here due to lack of air services. He added that this causes loss to tourism industry.
