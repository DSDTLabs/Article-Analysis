  In the Mumbai municipal corporation, Congress was swatted aside by a resilient   and a resurgent  , allies who parted ways to capture the ruling and opposition space in voters' mindspace. 
 
 The pathetic show in the state capital was part of Congress's no-show in other urban centres like Pune, Nashik and Thane.
 
 Coming after a dispiriting performance in panchayat polls in Odisha, the Maharashtra results are part of a pattern of decline that started with the 2014 defeat.
 
  Since being evicted from power in Delhi, Congress has lost a string of states like Maharashtra, Haryana, Kerala, Assam, J&K and  . It has also failed to put up a decent tally in panchayat and municipal polls over two years. 
 
 Amid the gloom, the sole redeeming feature for the party was Bihar where it was a minor partner in the winning coalition headlined by JD(U) and RJD in 2015.
