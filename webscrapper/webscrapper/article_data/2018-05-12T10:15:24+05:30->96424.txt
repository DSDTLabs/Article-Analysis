NAGPUR: Complaining of mismanagement at the centre for NEET, a student knocked the Nagpur bench of Bombay high courtâ€™s doors, praying for reconducting the exam or grant of average marks. The exam was conducted nationwide on May 6.

 A single judge vacation bench comprising justice   issued notices to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), District NEET exam committee and   at Hudkeshwar, which was allotted as centre of examination to the petitioner. The respondents were asked to file a reply before May 18.
 
 Petitioner  , through counsel  , contended that she and 22 other students at the centre were handed over the paper 30 minutes late than the scheduled time. After the bell rang at scheduled time 1pm, they requested for compensatory time of 30 minutes, due to the late start. However, the invigilator ignored all their pleas and withdrew the answer sheets from them and also told them to vacate the hall.
 
 The students then immediately apprised the centre head of the fiasco and raised a complaint. When they failed to get any feedback, they went to the collectorate, under which the district NEET exam coordination committee was functioning. An e-mail in this regard was sent to the CBSE, the regulatory body of NEET, but no response was received.
 
 As the results are scheduled on June 8, the petitioner has moved to HC, citing her petition as an urgent matter concerning crucial issue of professional education. She prayed for directing the respondents for at least granting average marks for the injustice meted out to them.
