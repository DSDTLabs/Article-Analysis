PATNA: The   project of Danapur rail division is set to be completed soon at a cost of about Rs 233.65 crore. The project envisages to provide a direct coal linkage to the  .

 Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Danapur DRM R K Jha said the railways currently runs two coal rakes every day from   route to fulfil the coal needs of Barh power station. However, at least 18 to 19 coal rakes can be plied every day after the commissioning of the flyover track. 
 
 Jha said the railwaysâ€™ first-of-its-kind flyover project would provide a segregated track for running coal wagons from Hazaribagh via Rajgir-Bakhtiarpur to Barh power station. A triangle-shaped flyover track is being laid at a stretch of about 18km between Bakhtiarpur and Barh for the purpose, which will ensure that normal traffic on the Patna-Jhajha mainline section is not disrupted.
 
 The flyover track has been designed in such a way that the coal rakes will directly reach the Barh power station through Rajgir-Bakhtiarpur route and the empty rakes after unloading coal will return from Punarkh end through the alleviated flyover track on the separate Up line, the DRM said, adding the ultra-modern flyover track would be a milestone achievement for the railways.
 
 According to sources, the railways has not been able to commission this project for lack of approach lines at Mohammadpur near Barh. The railways needs about 1.25 acre land there for which compensation was paid to about 24 families way back in 2007. But they are not vacating the land, the sources said, adding the district administration officials in Barh were approached by the railways for help, but to no avail so far. 
 
 The   track was a dream project of CM   when he was the railway minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government at the Centre. The railways has now urged Bihar chief secretary to intervene into the matter and get the land handed over to the railways for completing the flyover track project, a railway official said.
