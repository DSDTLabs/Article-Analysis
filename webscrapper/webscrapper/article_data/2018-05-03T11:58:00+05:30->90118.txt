Soumitra Chatterjee’s unmatched contribution to   art and culture has always been tagged with cinema and especially with the name of maestro   and his classic works.

 
  
 Soumitra had the opportunity to act in as many as 14 films directed by Ray which came with many diverse layers of characterization, style, presentation and performance. For example,   was completely different from what   portrayed.   gifted a whole new Soumitra to Bengali cinema, contrary to what we witnessed in ‘Ganashatru’, ‘Shakha Proshakha’ or even in the Feluda series.
 
 On the legendary filmmaker’s 97th birth anniversary, Soumitra revisited his golden memories associated with Ray, whom he has often called his "mentor". While speaking about the same, the veteran actor said despite his demise, Satyajit Ray is still alive for him and also inspiring him to go ahead even at the age of 83.
 
 To pay his respect and homage to his mentor, Chatterjee has even written a book,  , in which he recalls his experience of working with Ray. The celebrated Bengali actor had superbly preserved his golden memories of the famous filmmaker in a small box to unlock it years later in this book.
