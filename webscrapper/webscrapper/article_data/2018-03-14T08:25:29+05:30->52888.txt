BENGALURU: A   doctor duo who abandoned their   midway have approached the Karnataka high court demanding Rs 15 lakh as   as the elder woman had to be hospitalized due to alleged mismanagement by the travel organizer and both could not practise medicine for six months.

 Srinagar residents Dr S Shobha and her daughter Dr S J Rajalakshmi, who is physically challenged, have accused Ezi Drive Tours & Travel and Air India of poor service.
 
 The petitioners have sought refund of their tour fare of Rs 5.7 lakh (exclusive of the compensation) and rearrangement of the Switzerland-leg of their European tour. They have cited loss of medical practice during the six months of their hospitalization. Justice Vineet Kothari on Tuesday directed Air India, which flew the women on their outward journey during which Rajalakshmiâ€™s wheelchair was lost, to deposit Rs 5 lakh with the court, while adjourning the hearing to April 3.
 
 Listing out the chain of events that messed up the trip, Rajalakshmi claimed that on July 18, 2016 her wheelchair which was checked in at the Bengaluru airport did not arrive at the London airport, resulting in her being deprived of the facility. A series of missed trains and flights led to the duo not being able to visit many tourist spots in Scotland. 
 
 The duo said the tour was to culminate on August 8 but they abruptly ended it as the elder woman encountered serious health problems and arrived home on July 27, 2016. She was admitted to Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology, they said.
 
 A direction was sought to the Girinagar police to register an FIR based on their complaint.
