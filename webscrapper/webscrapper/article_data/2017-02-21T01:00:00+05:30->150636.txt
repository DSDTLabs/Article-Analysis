Actor   of   and   fame has acted in a short film titled, Viol. “Kumaran, who worked as an assistant director in my earlier film  , had approached me for this short film. Initially, I was sceptical to take it up. But once I heard the story, I wanted everyone to watch this film. The film talks about child abuse. I play protagonist’s brother in this film. Viol is a reflection of the recent child abuse incident, but the film was shot before the incident happened in reality. We wanted to create an awareness about child abuse. We created this society and whatever happens in this society, happens to us. Instead of being bystanders, we want people to take up a step that will bring about a change,” says Ashok. On their release plans, he says, “We will be taking this film to schools and other institutions to screen it. We will also release the film online, shortly.”
