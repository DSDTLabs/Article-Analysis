PATNA: Four unidentified criminals armed with rods and stick looted four precious ‘ashtadhatu’ (alloy of eight metals) idols from   at   near   under Kurhani police station in Muzaffarpur district around 10.15pm on Friday.

 The criminals also thrashed and injured the priest, Shashi Nath Mishra (70), before looting the idols. Mishra has lodged an FIR against unknown persons with Kurhani police station.
 
 Fakuli outpost in-charge B D Paswan said the incident took place within minutes after the villagers, who had gathered there for daily kirtan, left the temple. “Mishra tried to raise an alarm after which he was thrashed by the criminals,” he said. 
 
 Paswan said all dacoits entered the temple and removed the precious idols of Lord Ram, Sita, Laxman and Hanuman. The idols were 1.5 feet high. “A team of forensic experts reached the spot on Saturday and collected evidences, including some fingerprints. Later, a dog squad was also pressed into service but failed to make any breakthrough as the dacoits fled on feet,” said Paswan.
 
 When asked, he said no one has been detained for interrogation. He was also unable to tell about the estimated price of the looted idols in international market.
 
 Earlier also, three similar idols were stolen from Ram-Janaki Mutt at   under Katra police station area in the district on June 5 last year. But those idols were recovered on July 10 as the smugglers had left them by the roadside.
