MUMBAI: The   has directed the state government to take steps within the next three months for the construction of additional jails in Pune and Mumbai.

 With a particular focus on Byculla and Arthur Road prisons and Pune’s Yerawada jail, the high court bench of Justice A S Oka and Justice A A Sayyed also directed the state authorities, in a ruling on March 1, to consider additional constructions within the precincts of these three jails.
 
 The judgment was in response to separate writ petitions filed by Jan Adalat, a para legal services and legal aid, and  , a former inmate of Yerawada jail. 
 
 The court said an eminent architect and an eminent person from the field of public health are needed to be included in a multi-member committee being appointed by the state government for making recommendations on modernization of jails across the state. The panel is to be headed by a retired high court judge and will comprise the inspector-general of prisons, a retired deputy inspector-general of prisons and an eminent scientist from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. Referring to reports filed by judicial officers, who inspected the three jails in 2015-16, the bench observed, “The condition of the two jails in Mumbai and the Yerawada jail in Pune is far from satisfactory. The jails are overcrowded. In Arthur Road jail, the prisoners equivalent to nearly triple the capacity of the jail are detained”
 
 The bench emphasised the need for a scientific analysis of the current capacity of jails and the requirement for fifty years in future. Similarly, it stressed on the improvements needed in hospitals in the central prisons.
