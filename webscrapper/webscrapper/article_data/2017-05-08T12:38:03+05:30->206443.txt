BENGALURU: In the end, it was an absolute stroll in the park for  .

 Travis Head (75 n.o; 47b, 3x4, 5x6) and Mandeep Singh (52; 43b, 4x4,1x6) did their best to help hosts   post a challenging 158/6 in 20 overs, but openers   (50; 22b, 4x5, 6x4) and   (54; 17b, 4x6, 6x4) made a mockery of the chase with whirlwind knocks as Kolkata notched up a six-wicket victory to keep their   playoffs hopes alive.
 
 
 
 The intensity of the visitors' chase was such that they cruised to 50 runs in just 3.3 overs, as the pair used brute force to hammer a toothless Bangalore bowling attack Lynn, returning to action after being sidelined for over a month with a dislocated shoulder suffered in the match against Mumbai Indians, showed no mercy as he clobbered to Aniket Choudhary for 14 runs in the first over with two fours and two sixes.
 
  
  
 Yuzvendra Chahal too was not spared, as Lynn smashed the leg-spinner for 14 runs in the third over. Narine proved to be equally destructive at the other end. The West Indian took compatriot Samuel Badree to the cleaners in the fourth over, smashing 25 runs that began with a hat-trick of sixes.
 
 He then targeted S Arvind, hitting the pacer for 26 runs with four fours and a six. In doing so, Narine, notched up his half-century in just 15 balls. The breath-taking opening stand ended when Choudhary removed Narine, but not before the duo had added 105 runs off just 37 balls. Lynn, unbeaten on 93 against Mumbai before being sidelined, departed after reaching his fifty.
 
 Colin de Grandhomme and   then perished in quick time but that didn't make any difference as Kolkata reached their target in 15.1 overs. For the hosts, it was a matter of time before they suffered their tenth loss this season from 13 matches.
 
 Earlier, if it wasn't for gutsy half-centuries from Head and Mandeep, Bangalore would barely have managed a modest total. Asked to bat, Bangalore were in deep trouble early on as Umesh Yadav (3-36) took two big wickets to leave the hosts gasping at 202. The first to go was Chris Gayle, followed by skipper Virat Kohli.
