 “Mr   sir, there wasn't a party that ended without us dancing to your songs. Our friends used to fondly call us Amitabh and Jaya because my husband is 6'2“ and I am 5 ft,“ Sunayana had written. She also went on to write: “Shah Rukh Khan sir, he was a huge fan of yours, and he made sure we watched your latest movie Raees. I need your support to pass this strong message of spreading love and giving confidence to every foreign national that they fight will be listened to (sic).“
