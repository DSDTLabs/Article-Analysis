Ahmedabad: Riding high on around 20% annual growth in past six year, the nutraceuticals market in India is expected to double to Rs 26,764 crore by 2020. Drug Marketing and Manufacturing Association (DMMA) estimates that the nutraceutical industry is likely to grow by 16% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years.

 “With demand for nutrition supplements growing amid rise in lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure, obesity and cardio vascular problems, there is a huge growth potential for nutraceuticals, a market largely dominated by multinationals and pharma giants,” said Amit Thakkar, president, DMMA.
 
 The association, formed nine months ago in Gujarat, comprises around 100 nutraceutical manufacturers and marketers, who mainly represent micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Already a hub of pharmaceutical industry, Gujarat accounts for 20% of the nutraceutical market in India. 
 
 Previously, there were no specific rules for this segment of the industry, which was governed by food safety guidelines. However, new policies and regulatory framework for nutraceuticals is scheduled to come into force from January 1, 2018.
