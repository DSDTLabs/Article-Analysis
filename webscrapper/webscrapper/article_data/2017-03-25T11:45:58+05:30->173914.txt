Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh’s power generation capacity is 17,000 MW against an average demand of 7000 MW even during the peak summers. The low demand, coupled with ‘rigid’ power purchase agreements with private producers force the state government to pay even without using the power purchased. This anomaly, is causing a loss in revenue for the distribution companies while power generation by state-owned units is just 40% of the capacity. It is because of this low demand that the thermal power units are kept in reserve shut down, officials stated.

 The average power demand is hovering around 7,00 MW this season and will hardly go up another 1000 MW during summers. During the time of irrigation, power demand might touch 11,000 MW, sources said.
 
 Despite this trend for several decades, no significant growth in the industrial power demand in the state has happened, thus stagnating overall power demand. The state government increased power generation capacity to 17,000 MW, which is more than double the average need. 
 
 Power distribution companies have sought a tariff hike of 10% from the   Regulatory Commission, this year too. As per official information, just 1,676 MW is produced out of 4,120 MW capacity.
 
  Generation Company Limited (MPGENCO) managing director AP Bharive said, “There is no problem. But, the power demand has gone down and thus the thermal power stations have to be kept in reserve shut down. The average demand is between 6000 and 7000 MW.”
 
 A low demand, coupled with power purchase agreements, is leading to power surplus status. This is leading to a revenue loss for the distribution companies, said sources.
 
 In 2016-16 and 2016-17, discoms had to pay more than Rs 3,000 crore to both the government and the private consumers without being able to purchase any unit of power, sources added.
