Mumbai: A Bombay HC bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and N M Jamdar on Thursday imposed a cost of Rs 5 lakh on a public interest litigant and   his petition, observing that it appeared he filed it with an ulterior motive.

 The PIL, by Naosharwan Yusuf in 2014, had alleged that Mohhamed Raiees aka Lashkaria, the sole proprietor of Relliance Construction Co, had caused a Rs 25 crore loss to the state exchequer by not paying a premium in a   rehabilitation   in Andheri (W), near Gilbert Hill, a prime area. Anuj Narual, counsel for the builder, said the scheme was completed and flats were handed over to 196 slum-dwellers in 2007. The provision for payment of premium for slum schemes on government plots came into force from June 2008. He thus said there was no merit in the allegations and the   ought to be dismissed. He said the petition was more in private interest and filed due to animosity with the builder.
 
 The PIL said the collector’s office had documents and certified a plot as a censused slum based on forged documents. Denying the allegations, the builder said they were also “malicious and unsubstantiated’’. The plot was part of a 1.5 lakh sq mt plot that belongs to the state. Yusuf denied his PIL was filed with personal motive and said there was no case against him. The builder said Yusuf resided on a neighbouring plot and tried to encroach on the   plot, which petitioner’s counsel, A A Siddiqui, denied.
