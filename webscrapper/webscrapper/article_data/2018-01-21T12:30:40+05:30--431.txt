HYDERABAD: Lung-related ailments, especially interstitial lung disease (ILD), have seen a 50-60% jump in the last five years alone in the state. A variety of reasons are responsible for this alarming trend, said doctors at the Apollo ILD   that was launched in the city on Saturday. 

 ILD affects the usual function of the lung to carry oxygen from the atmosphere to the blood and releasing carbon dioxide from the blood into the atmosphere. "Rise in autoimmune diseases, increase of oxidative stress in the body and acidity-related problems are among the reasons behind ILD," said Dr  , senior interventional pulmonologist,  .
 
 "It is important to determine the specific form of ILD in each person. Every patient responds differently to treatment, so it is important for the doctor to monitor treatment. Sometimes variants of certain ILDs progress dangerously fast and can take lives of patients within a few months of the onset of symptoms," added the doctor.
