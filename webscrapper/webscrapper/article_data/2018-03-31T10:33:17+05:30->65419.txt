NAGPUR: The   directed a pilot husband to pay Rs 1 lakh/month maintenance along with Rs 50,000 towards cost of litigation to his doctor wife.

 Dismissing his contention that wife being a MBBS graduate, earns Rs50,000/month that was enough for her, principal judge IM Bohari ruled that wife and children are entitled to live as per the standard of husband/father.
 
 
  
 
 “Even if wife’s future potentiality to earn Rs50,000/month is considered, we can’t be oblivion of husband’s net income of about Rs5 lakh/month. Normal rule for wife’s entitlement is husband’s 1/3rd income that would enable her to claim about Rs1.66 lakh/month. If wife’s earning is deducted from his salary, she would still be entitled for Rs1.15 lakh/month to live as per his standards,” the judge held.
 
 After their high-profile marriage on June 1, 2015, they were blessed by a boy on February 23, 2016. But differences cropped up between them and they started residing separately from March 15, 2016. The husband, employed with a leading aircraft carrier, filed a plea for divorce under Sections 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 1955.
 
 The MBBS wife then filed a plea for maintenance of Rs1.50 lakh for her and kid along with litigation cost of Rs2 lakh. She claimed that the husband was drawing a whopping salary of Rs6.83 lakh/month of which, 4.68 lakh is net salary, which comes in his hand. 
 
 Husband countered her claims contending that she was previously employed as medical officer and drawing salary of Rs50,000/month. He said his mother was suffering from cancer and big amount was needed to take her to the USA for treatment.
 
 She argued that she was paid stipend or honorarium only of Rs15,000/month. She pointed out that her father-in-law is retired as a chief adviser to UNO and had decent pension, while elder brother is employed with multinational bank in Europe, and therefore nobody is dependent on husband.
 
 “At this juncture, the husband, being biological father of the child, is under legal and moral obligations to maintain them, subject to condition that wife has no or limited source of income,” Bohari said, while directing the husband to pay Rs85,000/month to wife and Rs15,000/month to the boy towards maintenance from January 1, 2017. He was also told to deposit the amount in wife’s bank account before 15th of every month and pay one year’s arrears in 28 instalments.
