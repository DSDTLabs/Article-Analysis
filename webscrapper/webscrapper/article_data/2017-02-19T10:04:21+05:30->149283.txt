AHMEDABAD: Proving a disproportionate assets (DA) case is always a challenge for the investigating agencies, be it Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or state-based   (ACB). 

 The challenge is to build a watertight case without giving a slightest hint to the person. 
 
 Are there ways to snoop into dealings of the person by using the latest technology and collect evidences?
 
 It was the central theme of one-day training session organized by state ACB officials at   (GFSU) earlier this week where apart from officials of   and Gandhinagar, representatives of   CIBIL Ltd and Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS) also discussed various methods for better investigation.
 
 Keshav Kumar, special director, ACB, said that purpose of the event was to broaden the vision of the ACB officials. 
 
 “In the conventional method, ACB used to write letters to respective department about the inquiry which used to expose the potential case and alert the official,” he said. 
 
 “But over the years, a number of new tools have emerged from where a person’s economic activities can be monitored and analyzed. We are hopeful that the attempt would result in better investigation of DA cases,” he added.
 
 While CBI officials discussed case studies and tricky cases related to the person’s and his/her family’s income sources, other speakers talked about tools such as CIBIL score and social media.
 
 “Higher rate of conviction in DA cases by CBI can be attributed to various factors including preparation of the cases in advance and trained prosecutors. Similar practices would soon be emulated,” said an ACB official.
