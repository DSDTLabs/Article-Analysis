 Indian Olympic Association ( ) general secretary Rajiv Mehta affirmed to ToI on Wednesday that the 36th   should take place in Goa in November 2018 and that ratification for the same is only a formality.
 
  “The Goa chief minister and the Goa Olympic Association (GOA) have expressed their readiness to host the Games next year which is good enough for ratification,” he said.
  
  Mehta met chief minister   last week along with top officials of the GOA, Sports Authority of Goa and state sports federations in a bid to seek assurance that the state was in a position to host the oft-postponed Games and decide on the dates.
  
  The meeting proved fruitful and a letter from the IOA granted Goa hosting rights of the Games, pending ratification at the association’s general body meeting in December.
  
  On Thursday, Goa minister of sports Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar, issued a press release saying, “ The IOA has awarded the hosting rights of the 36th National Games to Goa, scheduled for November 2018 and has asked the Government of Goa to proceed with preparations for the mega event.”
  
  Azgaonkar’s statement followed the receipt of a communique from Mehta addressed to Parrikar. It is learned that the GOA and the CM’s office are in the process of responding positively to the letter.
