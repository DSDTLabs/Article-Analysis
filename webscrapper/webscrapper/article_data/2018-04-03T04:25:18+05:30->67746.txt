MUMBAI: The   on Monday wondered if the   sarsanghchalak,  , would be branded "anti-national" or "anti-Hindu" for his comment that the country needed a protest against corruption. 

 The RSS sarsanghchalak voiced his opinion on the same issues the Shiv Sena had been raising, said the party mouthpiece Samna. It said the development could be a ray of hope given the situation in the country.
 
  "RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat pointed out that the administration has become weak and there is countrywide corruption. Because he admitted to corruption (in the country), will he be stamped as anti-national and anti-Hindu?" an editorial in the daily said. 
 
  The Shiv Sena was the first to speak on corruption and now Bhagwat has raised the same issue, said Samna. 
 
 Invoking Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's rule, Bhagwat last week asked who should be blamed for the changed times where a woman's safety was not guaranteed. The RSS sarsanghchalak said the country needed a protest against corruption. 
 
  "The country has always taken seriously the stands of Shiv Sena supremo late   and the heads of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh," the Samna editorial said.
