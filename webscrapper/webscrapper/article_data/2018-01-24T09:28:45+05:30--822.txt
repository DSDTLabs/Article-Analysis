PUNE: Single screen theatres and multiplexes in the city that will screen Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘‘Padmaavat’’ have sought police protection to avoid any incidents during the shows.

 The film will be screened on Wednesday evening with special paid previews. The film will release on Thursday. 
 
 All multiplexes in the city will screen the preview shows. Several have offered up to 10 shows or even more after 6pm on Wednesday. Bookings for all the shows on Wednesday and Thursday are online and ticket sales at counters will start only on Friday.
 
 President of Pune Exhibitors’ Association Sadanand Mohol said the association has written to chief minister   seeking security at all theatres. 
 
 “Supreme Court and the   for Film Certification have passed the film. Single-screen theatres in Pune will show it. We have written to Fadnavis seeking additional security in view of the protests. All theatre owners have written to the police stations in their area seeking protection on Tuesday,” he said.
 
 A senior officer from the special branch of the Pune police said, “We have relayed a message to all police stations to provide requisite bandobast to cinema halls and multiplexes as per the requirement.”
 
 Mohol said they exhibit the film once it is passed by the board. “We have refrained from putting up posters of the film on our premises as they may be torn down. Protesters may cause damage to the property,” Mohol added.
 
 Neerav Panchamia, vice-president for operations at E-Square, said they will screen the film. “We are hopeful that the state government will provide adequate protection to theatres. We plan to have extra security at our theatre, ” he added.
 
 Ticket bookings were tepid on Tuesday. “The protests and calls for a ban on the film may be responsible,” Mohol said. Panchamia said there was a good response to the film and people were buying tickets.
