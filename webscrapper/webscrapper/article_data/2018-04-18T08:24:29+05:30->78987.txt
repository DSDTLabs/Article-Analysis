New Delhi: The proposed plan to shift the   (NCA) from its current location at the   to a place near Bangalore airport in Devanahalli within the next three to four years could be a fresh bone of contention between the BCCI’s old guards and the   (CoA). The plan is to come up with a new   structure too but it could run into rough weather as   and   have not been able to see eye-to-eye on several issues in the past few months.

 
 
 Registration of 40 acres of land at the new venue has already been completed and BCCI's acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary is keen to break the deadlock over the NCA. Sources said Chaudhary could call a NCA committee meeting next month to take a final call on the project. The appointment of Tufan Ghosh as COO of NCA and his lack of approval from the general body means the old NCA committee could have a final say on the matter.
 
 With the development plan and tendering process yet to be finalised, BCCI’s old guards are of the view that any NCA revamp can’t be undertaken without involving former cricketers of repute. Any budget allocation for the new NCA would also have to be cleared by the BCCI general body.
