What happens when critically acclaimed actor   and Bollywood’s original hero   share a screen space together? It is bound to get interesting. Thanks to a   channel, now, the audiences are in for a cinematic treat as the duo are seen for the first time on screen for a short film— ‘Khujli’. 

 
 
  
  
 The plot can either be considered sensitive, because of ‘middle-aged couple’ as its central characters with ‘lovemaking’ a strong ingredient or, it could also be also considered hilarious. 
 
 
  
 In a statement issued to a website, Jackie said, “‘Khujli’ is a light-hearted film. I loved the story and the way   (director) narrated it. I really enjoyed working with the team of TTT.”
 Talking about the steamy scenes in the short film, Jackie added, “When your director holds a whip in her hands, it becomes easy for an actor to be kinky.”
 
  
 
 Neena, who has worked in powerful projects like ‘Gandhi, ‘Gumrah’, ‘Saans’ and television shows like ‘Ladies Special’, has featured in a short film for the first time. Speaking to media persons, she said “Shooting for ‘Khujli’ was as much fun as reading its script. When actors have enjoyed the process of doing the film so much, I am sure the audience would enjoy it too. It was a great experience,” 
 Written and directed by Sonam Nair, this short film highlights the importance of open-minded discussion not just about physical intimacy, but also all avenues of a sexual relationship.
