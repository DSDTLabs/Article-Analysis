PUNE: The Indian student community wanting to go to the   stands a better chance to work there, experts in the industry said. 

 With almost 89% of visa applicants coming from IT outsourcing companies, the chances of Indian students directly getting employed by the US companies fell.
 
 The US government introduced a legislation in the   on H-1B visa norms at the end of January. The legislation mandates that the minimum salary for H-1B visa holders be doubled, which would make it difficult for US companies to hire foreign workers, including IT professionals from India.
 
 Experts said the   changes affected outsourcing employees and these jobs have to be filled in the US itself. Due to the lack of high skilled professionals with advanced degrees in the US, these jobs will open for Indian students as they already have the F1 visa with optional practical training (OPT).
 
  that prepares students for universities abroad on Wednesday said the rule affects India’s IT outsourcing industry which is the biggest user of H-1B visas. 
 
 “Of the top 10 companies sponsoring H-1B visas, 89% visa applications are from outsourcing IT companies. This causes an acute shortage for H-1B visas on the whole, reducing chances for Indian students who are directly employed by US companies, filing for H-1B," Dilip Oak, director of the academy, said.
 
 With stricter regulations for Indian IT companies, more opportunities will open for students with advanced degrees. In other words, more visas will be available for students.
 
 The US economy needs a skilled knowledge workforce which is in short supply today. Students should take advantage of this situation, he added.
