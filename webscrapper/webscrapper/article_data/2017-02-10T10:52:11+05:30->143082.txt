CHARMINAR: An anti-encroachment drive by traffic police led to mild tension near   on Thursday as street vendors blocked the road near   in protest against the move.

 Nampally traffic police was trying to evict the hawkers with the help of police when they had to face the ire of street vendors. Around 60 vendors staged a protest in front of Niloufer Hospital by blocking traffic for a few hours. VIP movement had increased in the area in the past few days after the furore over deaths of five women at the hospital. The encroachments on the road had further affected traffic movement. Due to illegal occupation, the road leading to the hospital had become narrow, with several tea stalls, tiffin centres and other petty businesses being carried out round the clock on the roads in the area. It was after receiving a complaint from the   that the traffic police decided to remove the encroachments.
 
 But the hawkers alleged they had lost their livelihood due to sudden police action as for many years they have been conducting business in the area and helping the patients as well as attendants at Niloufer hospital. “The vendors have encroached pavements due to which the public was suffering,“ said inspector of traffic, Nampally G Harish.
