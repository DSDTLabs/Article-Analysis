Coimbatore: Garment exporters have urged the government to address the refund of un-subsumed taxes on exports through an appropriate mechanism in the ‘GST Council's’ meeting on October 6. 

 “Apparel industry is becoming uncompetitive due to embedded taxes presently not reimbursed under rebate of state levies and (duty) drawback schemes,” said A Sakthivel, regional chairman, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).
 
 These embedded taxes include the levies on cotton, construction, electricity, input tax credit restrictions for man-made fibres used in textiles and purchases made from unregistered dealers, he said. 
 
 “Refunds of the above indicated embedded GST taxes should not be seen as an incentive,” he stated. “The industry was expecting some relief from the steep hike in working capital requirement under GST regime, through continuation of old drawback rates, till the new rates (are announced) considering the embedded taxes not subsumed in GST,” Sakthivel said. 
 
 “Apparel industry is presently passing through stagnation on account of global slowdown and also due to domestic issues including cost of doing business, transactions cost, and cost of credit,” he said. 
 
 Sakthivel urged the Tamil Nadu government to take up these issues in the forthcoming ‘GST Council’ meeting to put in place a proper mechanism for refunding the embedded taxes not subsumed in GST. Ensuring lower incidence would ensure a competitive climate for the apparel sector in the challenging global and regional market situation, he said.
