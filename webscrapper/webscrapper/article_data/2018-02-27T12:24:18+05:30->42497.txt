CHENNAI:   remains one of the ever-popular runners from Chennai. On Sunday, Raghul – who already has four   medals under his belt – completed the Ironman 70.3 in  . Raghul finished the event in 5.02.37 and was placed 15th in his age-group. Unlike other Ironman events, the distance in this event was half but the effort and exhaustion nevertheless remained the same.

 
 Raghul, who’s previous Ironman was in Sweden last August, felt the event in Colombo was definitely a challenge. “We had heavy winds throughout the course and the weather was hot,” Raghul told TOI. Not surprisingly, Raghul’s penchant for doing Ironmans has meant that he is already the 2018 silver all World athlete, and India’s No.1 ranked athlete in the age-group 25-29. He was India’s No.1 ranked Ironman last year in the 25-29 age-group category. Raghul aims to be part of the Ironman World championships. Raghul derives a lot of inspiration from his coach  , former Czech Republic Olympian who was part of 2004 Games in Athens. Lucie has won the Ironman 70.3 South Africa and Ironman South Africa back in 2009.
 
 That’s not all. Raghul is a qualified marine engineer who had stints in corporates before pooling all his energies on his passion. Raghul completed his first couple of Ironman events in Langkawi (Malaysia) in 2014 and 2015.
 
 Today, he is one of the most-sought running coach and is helping over 50 people across age-groups attain their running goals. He is the head coach at Tri Crash ‘n’ Burn which comprises more than 60 runners and triathletes who look to push the limits.
