MANSA: Concerned over the spate of   in Mansa, an   in the district, seeking   support for their kin, has decided to digitise the   of these families whose cases have been approved by the administration. 

 The 2012-batch IAS officer Sanyam Aggarwal, who is the additional deputy commissioner (ADC), will disseminate information about suicide cases for NRIs and NGOs to help the families in distress. He has also decided to start a Facebook page and put a link on the official website of the district with the theme of debt free Mansa. A case of farmer suicide at   in Mansa some months ago, in which an NRI directly helped the bereaved family after going through media reports, inspired Sanyam to take the initiative. 
 
 He said, “The idea behind putting details about the suicide-hit families is to make philanthropists to pitch in and ensure at least the children of the deceased could get education. We will ensure that technical, psychological and financial support is provided by philanthropists to the distressed families. As far technical and psychological support is concerned, the district administration will stand by the victims’ families. For financial support, the philanthropists will be asked to make direct contact with the people.”
 
 Sanyam said initially, details of only those 75 families would be put on the district website whose cases had been approved for financial assistance. He said later those suicide cases would be taken up where approval was pending or denied due to some reason. He added a committee comprising financial experts and psychiatrists would be set up to interact with the families to help them recover from stress and a helpline number would also be announced shortly.
