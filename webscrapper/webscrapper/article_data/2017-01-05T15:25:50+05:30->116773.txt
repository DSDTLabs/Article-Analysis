GUNTUR: In a surprising development, the state government is gearing to take over the green fields in the   area even as amendment to the Land Acquisition Act is under active consideration. Following the instructions of the state government, district collector   issued a draft notification for acquisition of land in four riverbank villages - Krishnayapalem, Borupalem, Abbarajupalem and Ainavolu - in the capital city area on Wednesday. The fields notified for acquisition through the act are multi-crop irrigated lands. 

 The government is planning to take over nearly 82.45 acres from all the four villages.
 
 Very recently, the state cabinet decided to go for amendment to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 through an ordinance following the Gujarat model. The government wanted to skip the conduct of Social Impact Assessment (SIA) as well as cutting down the delay in taking over the lands required for public purpose. The state government is all set to issue the Ordinance with new clauses to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. "It could be a last ditch attempt by the government to threaten the farmers to join the Land Pooling Scheme (LPS). We are going to challenge the land acquisition notification in the court as it is illegal," said farmers' leader  . He said the government itself is violating the rules and regulations set by it and the laws enacted by it.
 
 In fact, the district collector's move to issue the notification for acquisition of land at this juncture has surprised even the field-level officials in the capital city area. "We were completely unaware of the development. We were, in fact, expecting the government to go for acquisition after promulgation of the ordinance," said a tehsildar who did not wish to be quoted.
 
 Farmers in riverbank area are in a piquant situation after the state government deciding to take over even the prohibited multi-crop irrigated lands by amending the law.
