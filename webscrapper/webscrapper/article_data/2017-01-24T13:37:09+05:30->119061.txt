In his upcoming film  , which sees   reunite with Director's Special filmmaker Guruprasad, the actor reveals that he has been part of a very unique fight sequence. 'The film has a lot of comedy and fun, but it also has masala, which has been woven to be a part of this interesting narrative that   has done. One such element is a fight sequence, which sees me enter a scene of distress and take on some bad guys. Of course, what makes this run-of-the-mill sequence different is the fact that I fight with just a towel on in this scene,' says Dhananjaya. The actor says that there is a comical justification for his attire for that scene, but adds that it was an interesting experience for him to be a part of the film. The film sees   play his love interest, while veteran actress Lakshmi will be seen in a pivotal role.
