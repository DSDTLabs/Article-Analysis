Nagpur: The decision to call a state board for wildlife ( ) meeting at a very   and then putting it off for January 31 has come in for sharp criticism from the board members.

 The chief minister’s secretariat on Wednesday shot off a letter to the principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) to convene the 13th SBWL meeting on January 20 at Mumbai at 11am. Thereafter, all members were informed with the message that the agenda would follow by a separate email.
 
 Some members told TOI that, as per rules, the notice for the meeting should be issued at least 15 days in advance and agenda at least 8 days ago. Some members received the meeting notice on Thursday.
 
 “If we do not receive the agenda in time, how will discussions on crucial issues take place,” some members said.
 
 “Is it possible to get confirmed reservation for trains or flights in two days. Last time when the meeting was called at short notice, some members had problem getting confirmed berths to return to their hometowns,” said other members.
 
 The SBWL is the state’s topmost decision-making body for projects falling in wildlife areas. The chief minister is the chairperson of the board while   (wildlife) is the member-secretary. The board meetings are never held regularly as chief ministers are busy. 
 
 “It it sad that the board is functioning in such a casual manner,” said a senior board member from Western Maharashtra.
 
 The sudden intimation led to hectic activity at the PCCF’s office with the staff pitching in to prepare the agenda. Sources said there were at least 27 items on it. It would have not been possible for the members to study so many items at a short notice.
 
 “Such hurriedly called meetings will certainly have some vested interest so that objections are not raised,” said a member.
 
 In the meanwhile, one of the senior members of the SBWL and environmentalist Bittu   has offered to quit as member of the board. Sahgal was not available for comments.
