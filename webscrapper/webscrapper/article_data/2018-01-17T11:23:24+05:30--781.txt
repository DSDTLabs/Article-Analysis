TIRUPATI: A new trust board for Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( ) will be in place soon,   N Chandrababu   announced during a visit to his native district of Chittoor on Tuesday.

 The chief minister also made another announcement, putting to rest speculations about the new TTD chairman. He dismissed the rumours of Putta Sudhakar Yadav, relative of finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, being appointed as the successor of Ch Krishnamurthy, the outgoing chairman of TTD.
 Though the tenure of the board lapsed almost eight months ago, Naidu did not appoint a new board. Instead, the executive officer was transferred and a new EO appointed. Several names, including former IAS officer Lakshmi Narayana, Beeda Ravi Chandra and Putta Sudhakar Yadav had cropped up in the list of potential chairmen, but no decision has been taken yet.
 
 TDP sources said that the state wing of the   had objected to Sudhakar Yadav’s name as his phots were seen as part of some Christian events.
 
 In the earlier board, two members had been removed for various reasons. Sekhar Reddy was sacked as he was arrested following an I-T raid while G Sayanna, an MLA from  , was removed for not attending two consecutive board meetings. The new board will have a few members on BJP’s recommendations.
