BATHINDA: With former Punjab finance minister (FM) Manpreet Singh Badal winning from Bathinda Urban constituency, speculations have started over him getting the same role in the Congress cabinet. In the run up to the election campaign, Manpreet was projected as the finance minister if Congress won the majority.

 Manpreet was the FM in   government from 2007 to 2010 before he left Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to form his party, People’s Party of Punjab (PPP). He was fielded in the 2014 parliamentary elections from Bathinda constituency against his cousin Sukhbir Singh Badal’s wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal and had lost by 19,000 votes.
 
 While campaigning for Manpreet at Bathinda, Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh had termed him as his finance minister. Manpreet too had been saying that he would be happy and do a lot if he got the key to the state treasury.
 
 “It is the prerogative of the party and the chief minister but whatever role is offered to me I will discharge my duty with utmost honesty. My first mission was to win the seat for the Congress. It is up to the party now. I have a lot of things in mind for Bathinda and will not sit back till I complete those projects. For that, there will be dire need of finances and the party has assured me everything I need to fulfil the promises made to the people,” Manpreet said after his victory. After winning from Bathinda in 2002, Surinder Singla had become the finance minister in the Amarinder-led Congress government. 
 
 Manpreet won from Bathinda Urban assembly segment by 18,480 voters from Deepak Bansal of   (AAP). His followers observed Holi on his victory. 
 
 Due to his closeness to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Manpreet was considered as a key member of the party and was entrusted with the task of framing the manifesto along with former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.
