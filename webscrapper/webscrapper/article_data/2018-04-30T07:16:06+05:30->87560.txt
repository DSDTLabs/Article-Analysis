KOLKATA: An app crab driver allegedly dozed off while driving his vehicle and crashed into a bus shelter and two temporary shops adjacent to it on EM Bypass-Prince   connector early on Sunday. The driver has been arrested.

 
 The driver sustained injuries on his face, chest and limbs. The cab did not have any passenger when the accident took place.
 
 Cops said the driver,  , in his 30s, admitted that he had dozed off and that is why he lost control of the car. “The driver has told us that he had fallen asleep. When the incident happened there were not many cars around him and he was also not speeding. Had he been speeding, the situation could have been worse. It seems a plain case of dozing off while holding the steering,” said an officer at   police station.
 
 After interrogation cops said Dey has been driving from Saturday afternoon with very little break in between.
 
 “At the time of the accident he was on his way to park the vehicle at a   garage after dropping a passenger at the airport,” said the officer.
 
 This February a student was killed on the way to a PhD entrance examination and three of his friends were injured, when the app cab they were travelling in dashed into a median divider near the Metropolitan crossing on the EM Bypass after the driver dozed off at the wheels.
 
 A series of accidents where the driver dozed off on wheels, has put light on the punishing schedule that most app cab drivers subject themselves to make the profession financially rewarding.
