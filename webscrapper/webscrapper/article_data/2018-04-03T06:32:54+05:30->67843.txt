LUCKNOW: Facing opposition from teachers on the introduction of multiple choice questions (MCQ)-based examinations in the odd semesters of undergraduate courses,   has postponed its faculty board meeting scheduled on Tuesday for the second time. 

 According to the proposal, the first, third and fifth semesters of BSc course will have MCQ-based examinations while in the second and fourth semesters, theory and practical examinations will be held. The final semester will have theory-based examinations.
 
 The science faculty objected to the new pattern saying that the number of practicals will get reduced in the new pattern. 
 
  LU officials, however, denied that the meeting has been postponed owing to differences on the MCQ proposal. "Meeting has been postponed because another meeting of all heads is scheduled on Wednesday. The new dates for the meeting will be decided soon," said LU spokesperson NK Pandey.
