MEERUT: The   ( ) issued a showcause notice to controversial Unnao MP   on Tuesday over his “four wives, 40 children” remark that indirectly blamed Muslims for “the population explosion” in the country.

 The EC said prima facie the BJP MPseemed to have violated the model code of conduct and asked him why action should not be taken against him for his controversial remark. The EC has set Wednesday morning as the deadline for Sakshi’s reply. Also faced with an FIR that was filed by the Meerut police as   had made the statement here during a meeting of sants last week, the chastised MP defended himself and said “the media has misrepresented” his statement.
 
 Putting forward the argument that even Lord Krishna had 16,000 wives who bore him 10 children each, and king Dashrath had three wives, the BJP leader said he had done nothing wrong by making the statement at a religious event. “Even our Lalu Prasad Yadav has a dozen children,” he said. It’s a different matter that the Bihar politician has nine. “I never said anything against Muslims. I did not even use the term ‘Islam’. Yes, I admit that I said population is increasing because some people have four wives and 40 children. How can media relate this to Muslims?” Sakshi added.
 
 Expressing his surprise over EC’s renewed interest in the case, he told TOI on Tuesday, “I respect EC’s command and will comply accordingly. But I am surprised at the way things are twisted out of proportion. The Meerut event was a religious one...I did not use the term ‘Musalman’ even once...Is it wrong to comment on population increase in India?
 
 We have limited land and resources. If we keep on increasing the population, how long can mother earth bear the additional burden?”
