Shimla: As many as 30,000 students belonging to Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) from different educational institutes across the state will launch ‘Akrosh’ rally against the state government in Shimla on Thursday, demanding resumption of student elections, abolition of semester system in colleges and shunning “wrong practices” of selecting teachers.

 “As many as 375 buses carrying thousands of students will reach Shimla’s entry points –– bypass, Dhali and Boileauganj –– at 9:30am from where the students will begin the rally. They will gather at Lakkar Bazaar’s skating rink at 11am from where the mass protest will be launched. We have been preparing for the March 30 rally since the past three months by visiting all cities and panchayats of the state,” said Gaurav Attri, campus president, ABVP unit of Himachal Pradesh University.
 
 Attri said this rally would also involve their big leaders like national general secretary Vinay Vidrey, national organisational secretary Sunil Ambekar.
 
 “The state government is trying its best to stop students from joining the rally by conducting exams on unusual dates and teachers asking students not to join rally else their marks will be deducted. We will be launching the rally peacefully to avoid any traffic jams, but if government tries to stop the buses at barriers or anywhere, we would launch chakka jams by blocking the roads and will surrender ourselves through mass arrests which will be more troublesome for the government,” he threatened.
