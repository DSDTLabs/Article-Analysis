CHENNAI: The Enforcement Directorate and the CBI 'arrested' Parasmal   in connection with the currency seizure case involving J  , but not before the special court for CBI cases pulled up the premier agencies for seeking custody of Lodha without first arresting him.

 After the special judge, K Venkatasamy, rapped the agencies, they prepared an instant arrest memo based on which Lodha was arrested in the Sekhar Reddy case and cited as sixth accused. Reddy was arrested after over Rs 34 crore was seized from his premises last month.
 
 On the basis of I-T department information, the CBI and the ED stepped in and arrested five people, including Reddy's associates M Prem Kumar and K Srinivasulu. Lodha was picked up in Kolkata and a huge sum in new currency notes was seized from him too.
 
 After producing Lodha before K Venkatasamy, judge of the XI additional sessions court for CBI cases, at 3.45pm on Thursday, the CBI and the ED sought his custody.
 
 An irked judge pointed out that he had been brought from Kolkata and asked how without a formal arrest the ED and the CBI could seek his custody?
 Following the reminder, the agencies filed an arrest memo before the judge.
 
 Later, the judge wondered how the case could be referred to his court by the principal special court for CBI cases. He said the XI additional sessions court was a special court for the CBI's bank fraud cases from Tamil Nadu and Bengaluru.
 
 To this, counsel for central agencies said the special court had enormous powers and the XI additional sessions court was well within its jurisdiction to hear the matter.
 
 The judge then agreed to hear the case, saying it was a matter of national importance. He later remanded Lodha in judicial custody till January 19.
