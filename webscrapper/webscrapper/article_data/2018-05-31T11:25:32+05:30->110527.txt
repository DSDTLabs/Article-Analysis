 Giving more information about the same, Arvinder Singh Ranga, Commissioner of Customs said, “The exporters and trade associations have represented for seeking resolution of problems which have hindered sanction of refund of IGST paid to them. In order to solve this issue, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is observing the second IGST refund fortnight from 31st May to 14th June in which the pending IGST refunds claims will be disposed off. In this major drive to facilitate the exporters and to clear the pendency of the IGST refund we have nominated jurisdictional Deputy/Assistant Commissioners of the   (ICD) GRFL, ICD Kanech, ICD Concor, CFS OWPL, CFS KCM, ICD PSWC, ICD Baddi, ICD Pristine and ICD Jalandhar as Nodal Officers for disbursal and monitoring of the refund cases”

Accordingly Senior Officers have been appointed as Nodal Officer for the said purpose”
