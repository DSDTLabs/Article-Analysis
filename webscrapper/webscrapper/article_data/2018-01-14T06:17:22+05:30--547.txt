AHMEDABAD: Gangs torching parked motorbikes seem to be back in the city after a gap of a year or so. On Friday night, 11bikes parked near   and   Society of  , were torched by anti-social elements. Local people woke up at 3am to find their vehicles engulfed in flames. They had parked their bikes outside their houses.

 Sources in the police said that on the basis of   footage gathered from a camera installed near the shops, the cops had picked up two persons, including a minor, who are seen in the footage leaving after torching the bikes.
 
 “However we have not arrested them yet,” said a police officer.
 
 “Prima facie, it seems that the youths were drunk and were finding pleasure in torching bikes,” the police officer said.
 
 Similar incidents had occurred during 2015-16 in Ghatlodia,   and   areas of the city. The police found themselves on the back foot as it was very difficult to identify the culprits. They had committed the crime in the dead of the night and there were no eyewitnesses. Later, a gang was indentified which had allegedly torched the vehicles in Maninagar.
 
 “We were relieved when the incidents suddenly stopped after busting of the gang by Maninagar police,” said a senior cop. “This latest bike-burning incident has again put us on the alert.” Sources in the police said that local residents of the area near Fruit Market in Sardarnagar and Ambawadi had suddenly waken up at about 3 am to see their vehicles burning.
 
 
 “Fire department officials rushed to the spot and doused the fire. We have registered an offence against unidentified accused but are hopeful of cracking the case. We have detained two, including a minor,” the police official said.
