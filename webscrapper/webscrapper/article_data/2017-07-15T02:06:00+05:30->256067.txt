Visakhapatnam: A few days back, the nodal centre of   (toll-free helpline number 1098 for protection of children) in the city received a call from a bureaucrat’s daughter. She sought help from Childline officials to stop her parents from forcing her to take up science. Consequently, officials intervened and the child was assured that she will be allowed to choose the subject of her choice.

 From stopping child marriages to getting complaints against parents for forcing children to take up subjects they do not want to pursue, Childline, which is supported by the ministry of women and child welfare and the social work department of Andhra University, has been regularly getting such cases from children and at times from their relatives and neighbours. 
 
 The child welfare officials say that with increasing awareness, more number of cases are being reported these days. City coordinator of Childline A Mary Evangeline, said, “We get two to three calls daily. It sometimes goes up to five to six calls per day. In most of the cases, children themselves call rather than seeking help from someone else. A few years ago, we did not receive cases on a daily basis. Our officials are involved with rescuing, rehabilitation and producing the children before the child welfare committee.”
