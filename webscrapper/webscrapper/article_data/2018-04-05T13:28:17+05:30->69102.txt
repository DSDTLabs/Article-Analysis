PANAJI: Taking a dig at   mandal president  , who objected to the inclusion of Taleigao within the ambit of the   Planning and Development Authority, the   on Wednesday reminded him that the Greater Panaji PDA was a gift from chief minister Manohar Parrikar to former MLA Atanasio Monserrate for the latter’s support in the Panaji by-elections.

 “If   Naik doesn’t want the PDA, he should talk to the chief minister who personally signed the note for creation of the Greater Panaji PDA and who appointed Monserrate as the chairman,” AICC secretary Girish Chodankar said.
 
 Naik, on Tuesday, said that Taleigao should have never been part of a PDA since the village did not have the infrastructure to support any vertical development.
 
 Chodankar asked him to appeal to Parrikar if he genuinely wanted Taleigao to be removed from the Greater Panaji PDA. “People can see through the lies that the BJP keeps telling,” Chodankar said. “It is a BJP government coalition partner who created the PDA, so why is the BJP objecting?” 
 
 The Congress said that it would support the residents of several villages in   who are expected to hold a peaceful protest on April 6 against the Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority.
