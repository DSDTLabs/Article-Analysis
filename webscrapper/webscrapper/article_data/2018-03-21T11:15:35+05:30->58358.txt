The site which is shortlisted for the vending zone is also accident prone and the proposed vendor market on the site will create huge traffic logjams adding to the woes. A sheer lack of parking space will also create utter chaos in the area.
 
 Another issue raised was about the removal of police beat box from the site. Residents mentioned that snatching cases among other petty crimes are on a rise. Thus, the removal of the beat box will add to the woes of the residents in the locality.
 
 The residents proposed that the vacant land facing the gate number 3 of MHC should be earmarked for the proposed vendor market.
