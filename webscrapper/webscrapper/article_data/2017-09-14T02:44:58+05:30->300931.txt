KOLKATA: Everything seems to be falling in place for the New Garia-airport   alignment. After the eviction of 11 encroachers at  , the impasse over construction of the New Garia terminal has finally been solved. The construction of the station remained stuck for three years as a single ‘land-loser’ refused to part with his plot. Land for the project was vested in 2003. 

 When   engineers started construction on the land right next to Kabi Subhas station three years ago, they came across Rabin Sardar, who claimed to be a “victim of forceful land acquisition”. During acquisition of moujas Briji-27 and Goragachha 45 in Sonarpur, Rabin’s late father Manoj had agreed to accept Rs 1,47,25,735 awarded for 96 cottahs that belonged to him. But his successors came up with fresh demands, including TDS waiver and return of 7.5 cottahs from the vested land.
 
 On February 6, TOI first reported on how an individual was holding up the Metro project. The day after, at the behest of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, mayor   called a meeting at Nabanna. A series of meetings followed and the land owner accepted the rehabilitation package.
 
 “We were determined to free this land because it had already been acquired.We can’t afford to let an individual’s interest come in its way, especially when the matter had long been resolved,” Chatterjee said, happy that the project he had been assigned to streamline has taken off.
