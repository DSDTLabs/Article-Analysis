At a gathering organised recently at   for the students of   department, we saw creativity and camaraderie rule supreme. Also, there was no dearth of fun moments at the event. Many youngsters were engrossed in various creative activities and some were busy chatting about latest movies and sharing notes on fashion. Collegians also tickled their taste buds savouring different chaat items on the premises. Adding some more colour to the do, there were quite a few students who came decked up in traditional attires and caught everyoneâ€™s attention. Beating the winter blues in style, we spotted the teachers donning beautiful shawls even as they made sure the decorum is maintained.
