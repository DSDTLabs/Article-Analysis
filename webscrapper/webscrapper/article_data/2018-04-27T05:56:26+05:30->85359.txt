BENGALURU: Prime Minister   on Thursday said Bengaluru represents "Hindustan on the world stage" and said the development of Karnataka's capital is his government's utmost priority. 

 Quizzed by his 'colleague' Rajajinagar MLA S Suresh Kumar over the Centre's priorities for Bengaluru, during a video interaction with   workers from poll-bound Karnataka, Modi said: "For me, Bengaluru represents not just the state of Karnataka but entire Hindustan on the world stage. The world looks towards Bengaluru for the value it adds to the global economy. However, I have noticed serious concern over its development. This concern of lack of development is not only for the city or state but for the entire nation."
 
 Delving into the past when he was associated with BJP as a party worker, Modi recalled frequent meetings with Kumar and others, who, 20 years ago, were corporators of Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP).
 
 "When I used to go there frequently, to learn from you all, I found myself drawn towards the information technology revolution in Bengaluru. But when I became chief minister of  , and since then, I slowly started noticing the stagnation of urban development in the city. It is a point of concern for the entire country that the city is under such infrastructure crisis," he said.
 
 He exonerated Bengalureans from being responsible for the city's infrastructure crisis, hinting at the incumbent   government's culpability for the state of affairs. "I believe Bengaluru's sorry state of affairs is not the fault of Bengalureans. The city has the eagerness to contribute to the nation and wants to grow with the nation," he said.
 
 Modi said the Centre was forever committed towards Bengaluru's development and that the recent announcement of Rs 7,000 crore in Union Budget 2018-19 towards the suburban rail network is a prime example of this intent.
