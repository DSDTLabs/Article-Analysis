After a tumultuous legal battle with   and KriArj Entertainment, John Abraham’s ‘Parmanu- The Story of Pokhran’ finally released last week and the movie has been doing well at the box-office. John stood as a lone fighter in order to win the battle against his movie’s former co-producers and emerged out as a winner. 

 
 There were several reports on how no one from the   industry came to John’s rescue while amidst this mudslinging, and even he had spoken about his disappointment towards the same. However, he did not pay much heed to this and continued to focus on more important things in life, one of which was the smooth release of ‘Parmanu- The Story of Pokhran’.
 
 
 Recently, there were rumours about John being   being upset with   for not helping him in the legal battle against producer Prernaa Arora of KriArj Entertainment. It was rumoured that when all the trouble started John reached out to Akshay seeking help but the 'Rustom' actor didn’t step in. It was stated that since Akshay shares a good rapport with Prernaa, he didn’t want to intervene between the two, which left John disappointed. 
 
 
 However, now John and Akshay have clarified that there is no truth to these reports and both of them continue to remain in the best of terms. The ‘Desi Boyz’ actors took to Twitter to put an end to these rumours and baseless speculations.
