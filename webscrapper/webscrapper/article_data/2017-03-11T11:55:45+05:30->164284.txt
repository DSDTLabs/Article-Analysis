NEW DELHI: Manipur chief minister   of the Congress party won in Thoubal constituency. He has defeated BJP's Leitanthem Basanta Singh and rights activist and PRJA chief  ,who debuted as a political leader this Assembly polls. She recieved less than 100 votes.

 The three-time chief minister had a comfortable victory over Irom Sharmila with a margin of 15,000 votes. The BJP candidate Leitanthem Basanta Singh stood on the second spot after the chief minister.
 
 Sharmila broke her 16-year fast last year and floated a party of her own - the 'Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance' - to fight the Assembly elections in her quest to get the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act - AFSPA repealed. 
 
 The elections in Manipur this time are a crucial test for the 15-year-old Congress regime which is facing a stiff challenge from the BJP. The BJP leaders have criticised the ruling Congress for its alleged failure to solve the over three-month-long economic blockade paralysing the two national highways of the land-locked state, which was the key issue in the first phase of polls in Manipur.
