Out of sight is out of mind. Why else would the producers' section of Eastern India Motion Pictures Association take matters in its own hands in the absence of its supremo, who is also the chief of all things cinema in  ? If insiders are to be believed, He Who Must Not Be Named was busy when a flag of dissent was raised in  . It's common knowledge that the Dhanukas were forced to return from London after an ugly run-in with Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India, which halted the shoot of   over an inadequate number of technicians. After the loss of a crore, the umbrella body for technicians also imposed a ban on the Dhanukas, leading to the cancellation of the Kolkata chapter of their other film, Tui Sudhu Amar. I hear, despite the many calls made to him by the producers, He Who Must Not Be Named chose to remain silent. And since silence is not always golden in the filmi world, many producers lent their support to the Saturday meeting called by EIMPA and the Dhanukas against the high-handedness of the Federation. EIMPA was of little help in forging peace, but turned around at a time when He Who Must Not Be Named was out of the country. There were rumours of the Dhanukas -who slapped a legal notice against the Federation -approaching the Competition Commission of India (CCI) where warring film parties land up finally. If all goes well, the EIMPA elections will be held in September. Last time there was an election, He Who Must Not Be Named emerged as the uncontested leader. From what I see, he might not get that lucky this time 
around.
