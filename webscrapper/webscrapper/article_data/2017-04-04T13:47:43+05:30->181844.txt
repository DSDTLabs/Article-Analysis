GAYA: Gearing up to ensure a peaceful  , the district administration has identified nearly two dozen sensitive points in   town. Besides deployment of static police force at these points,   cameras would be installed in the vulnerable areas, which include   and Nadiraganj.
 
  Though Gaya is known for its iconic harmony, some miscreants over the years have been trying to fuel tension through provocative actions and words. One such attempt was made through serial defacing of the images of deities in the Ramshila area of the town eight years back. In 2012, violence and arson was reported from the   police station area following route change and absence of static magistrates from the point of deployment.
  
  But for a couple of minor aberrations, the well-meaning citizens have maintained peace and harmony in the town. According to district magistrate Kumar Ravi, altogether 70 licences have been issued to Ram Navami organizers in Gaya town. Organizing committee members would be held responsible for any deviation from the terms of licence and the processions would be allowed only through pre-identified routes. “For reasons of safety, power supply will remain cut so that high mast flags don’t come into contact with live wires. Adequate arrangements have been made for power backup and one dozen generator sets fitted on vehicles would escort the processions. Arrangements will also be made for static power generator sets to ensure sufficient light on the procession route,” said the DM.
  
  He also warned rumourmongers. Earlier, a health department official was jailed and removed from services for posting/forwarding communally provocative canard.
