BENGALURU: A lawmaker’s son brutally assaulting another youth and evading arrest for hours is a matter of concern. But political parties out to use the incident to score brownie points over rivals caused a nightmarish crawl for Monday morning motorists in the Central Business District. The Cubbon Park police station became a battleground for contending parties to put up a show of strength and motorists on Kasturba Road faced the brunt of it. Traffic ground to a halt for most of the morning on Kasturba Road. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	 



































 Scores of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers first landed at the station by 10.30am. “We want justice and the Congress government is becoming a goonda government,” they shouted. By 11.10am, Congress workers landed in dozens, accusing the BJP of politicising every incident. “Down down BJP, silly politics,” they shouted. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	 

























 At noon, a bunch of JD(S) workers holding banners of Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy sat on the pavement outside the station, shouted slogans, describing both BJP and Congress as “irresponsible parties”. “Both over-react to every issue. We want a reasonable and mature chief minister this time,” they said. The protesters seem to have forgotten that all three parties have had their share of netas’ children, creating ruckus in public places and attacking rivals. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	 

























 Hearing the commotion and watching the huge traffic jam, additional commissioner of police (west) B K Singh and DCP Chandragupta came out and persuaded workers of all three parties to clear out.
