GHAZIABAD: Alleged anomalies in the UP Rera   are undermining the objective of the much-touted Act, which was introduced around four months ago to protect the interests of homebuyers, said a section of flat owners.

 Fed AOA, a consortium of apartment owners’ associations (AOA), which has found a number of faults in the website, has recently written to urban development minister  , seeking corrective measures.
 
 Alok Kumar, the president of Fed AOA, while listing out the faults, said, “The website, which was launched by chief minister   amid with much fanfare in July, promised to contain all details about builders and their projects. However, very few builders have provided detailed information about their projects on the website. This is a violation of the Rule 14 of the   Act, which makes it binding for builders to provide point-wise details of their projects on the website” added Kumar.
 
 Kumar further pointed out that in the absence of detailed reports, buyers are likely to fall into the trap of builders. “It’s defeating the purpose of the Rera.” 
 
 The website should ideally have true disclosure on the track records of developers, status of fire, environmental and other necessary clearances, among others. 
 
 But, Kumar claimed, that only 10 % of the details have been uploaded.
 
 Despite such blatant violation of   rules, the government or the agencies concerned have done little to prevail upon the erring builders to fall in line. “Just have a cursory glance on the website and you will see that close to 200 projects have been uploaded but hardly any project carries detailed information,” alleged Kumar.
