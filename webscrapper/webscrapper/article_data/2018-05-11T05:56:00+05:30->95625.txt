NAGPUR: The National Tiger Conservation Authority ( ) has said ‘no’ to capture and treat the injured adult tiger found in Mogarkasa forest, 65km from here in Paoni range.

 According to forest officials, the   was found by forest labourer Anil Salame in compartment number 440 in Paoni forest on Tuesday (May 8). Prima facie, it seems the tiger has swelling in right front leg, and hence its movement is sluggish.
 
 As NTCA norms prohibit a free ranging animal from being lifted for treatment, the tiger is being monitored with the hope that the injury might heal naturally. The NTCA has also opposed the idea of putting out baits for the tiger, as it would make it habitual to easy prey.
 
 As per NTCA guidelines, a committee consisting of NGOs Kundan Hate, Vinit Arora, Aditya Joshi, wildlife vets Dr Vinod Dhoot and Dr Gautam Bhojane, sarpanch Ramkrishna Warkhade, and police patil Bharat Vanjari is studying the situation. The committee will submit its report soon.
