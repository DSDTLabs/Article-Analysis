Chennai:   officer  , a former city police chief, retired from service on Monday after a 34-year career in the force.

 The 1983-batch officer, whose fellow officers fondly referred to as ‘KR’, was as well known as an encyclopaediac source of knowledge about the police force, especially to new superintendents of police, as he was for his contributions to the education of poor children.
 
 Radhakrishnan, who retired as DGP, CID, civil supplies, and twice won the Queen’s Award for Innovation in Police Training and Development, had a clear understanding of how police should enforce the law, a senior officer said. “Radhakrishnan drafted several schemes on operations for the force,” the officer said. “His retirement is a loss for the state police.”
 
 During his first tenure as assistant superintendent of police in Dindigul, Radhakrishnan busted several LTTE training camps. He soon became a specialist in anti-LTTE operations.
 
 The government in November 2008 posted Radhakrishnan as Chennai City police commissioner. He won acclaim for a crackdown on smuggling of essential commodities but a outburst of violence marred his six months as commissioner. Radhakrishnan could do little to quell an ugly clash between policemen and lawyers in the high court on February 19, 2009.
