GANDHINAGAR: The  , which rules the corporation and state, has failed to maintain the   Municipal Corporation schools. The number of   ‘weak’ (C category) and ‘very weak’ (D category) increased in 2015-16.

 The state government, in a written reply tabled in the state assembly, said that in 2014-15, there were 102 C and D category schools. This number almost doubled, in 2015-16, when 202 schools were graded ‘C’ or ‘D’. Students at schools in these categories perform badly in their studies.
 
    said that the number of ‘very weak’ schools which was 69 in 2014-15, almost doubled to 133 schools in 2015-16. 
 
 Shaikh said Gunotsav is defined as an accountability framework for the quality of primary education, which includes learning outcomes as well as co-scholastic activities, use of resources and community participation. “Is the government not accountable for the increasing number of C and D category schools in the city?” Shaikh asked.
 
 In another reply, however, the government claimed that the number of such schools in other parts of the state was falling. For example, in rural Ahmedabad there were 246 schools in the ‘C’ category and 634 schools in ‘D’ category in 2014-15. The Gunotsav in 2015-16 revealed that the number ‘C’ category schools was 43 and that of D category schools was 32.
 
 In Rajkot and Patan too, the number of schools in the ‘C’ and ‘D’ categories had declined.
