Goa State Pollution Control Board will monitor the quantity of coal that is being imported from Australia and South   to ensure that it does not exceed the limits provided by the consent to operate.

 SWPL had sought relaxation and pleaded before the court to allow the nine ships which are already enroute to be giver berthing permissions and to allow unloading of coal at the berth numbers 5A and 6A.
 
 “The board will send a person to monitor on a daily basis the coal that is unloaded,” a source with GSPCB said. “The quantity that is unloaded should not be more than the permissible limits of the consent to operate.”
 
 GSPCB had recently withdrawn the consent to operate granted to SWPL under Section 21 (4) of the Air Act but the High Court had allowed SWPL to unload the vessels which were already on their way with coal.
 
 “It is only a temporary measure. The long term issue has to be resolved. We cannot stop industrial activity,” chairman of Mormugao Port Trust I   said.
 
 “The vessels were already loaded and are in voyage and will arrive on various dates till February 15,” an SWPL official said.
