The 66-year-old, best known for his role of Luke Skywalker in the hit series, was honoured in a ceremony in front of Los Angeles' El Capitan Theatre and it was attended by   and director  , along with robot R2-D2. 

 "These will be brief remarks because words truly fail me. It's hard to convey my gratitude, my joy, the exhilaration of being recognised this way. I haven't been this speechless since 'The Force Awakens'," Hamill said. 
 
 "If it weren't for the public, I'd be nowhere. From Jedi to Joker and back again, it's been a fantastic ride. Thank you so much and may the force with each and every one of you," he added. 
 
 Ford, who played the character of Han Solo in the series, remembered late Carrie Fisher at the ceremony. Fisher, who portrayed the role of Princess  , passes away in December 2016. "When thinking about today, I was really sorry we don't have the other member of our trio to celebrate with us, but I feel her presence," Ford said. 
 
 Fisher's daughter   was also present at the ceremony along with Kelly Marie Tran, who featured in recently released 'The Last Jedi'. Lucas also praised the actor and said, "Mark Hamill is a character that can't be written." 
 
 "He is extremely enthusiastic about everything that he does, and that s exactly what I was looking for when I was looking for Luke Skywalker," he added.
