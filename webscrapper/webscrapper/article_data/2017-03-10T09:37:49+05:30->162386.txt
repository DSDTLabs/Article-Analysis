LUCKNOW: With   round the corner,   asked students for their opinion on how the festival should be celebrated, in their first exam on Thursday. 

 The class XII   paper had a 10-mark question that talked about how during Holi, which expresses pure and simple joy, people start throwing colours on each other and even on strangers. The   were asked to write a speech as the   or head boy on the ‘Dos and Don’ts’ of Holi in the morning assembly. 
 
 Students came out happy and relieved that the “lengthiest paper of exams” had ended on a good note. Some students, though, claimed that the reading passages took nearly one and half hours. Others said they managed to finish before time because of practice. 
 
 Akshay, a student of Seth MR Jaipuria School, said, “The paper was easier than expected. I had been revising the syllabus 10 times a day.”
 
 Shweta, a student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Gomtinagar, said, “The paper was a bit too long. I spent too much time in answering questions of part A, and got very little time for part B. I had to skip a few questions because of lack of time.” 
 
 Teachers too agreed that the reading passages were slightly “twisted” as answers to the questions were not easy to find in the passage. However, they said children were generally satisfied with the difficulty level of the exam. 
 
 In another question, students were asked to imagine an incident where an accident takes place outside their school and students rush out to help passengers. Considering themselves as part of the rescue team, students were to pen down the incident and their friend’s role, for the school newsletter.
 
 After the exam, students celebrated Holi as they would appear for their next exam only after the festival. 
 
 “My next exam is on March 20. I have enough time to prepare for it. I will celebrate Holi with friends and family,” said Abhimanyu, a student.
