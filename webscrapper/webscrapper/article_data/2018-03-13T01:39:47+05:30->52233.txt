NEW DELHI:   should   for another   in the coming days as the   in   have   below normal. This might even lead to closure of production at Chandrawal and Wazirabad water treatment plants.

 Seeing the severity of the situation, Delhi Jal Board has approached the Delhi High court to issue direction to the Haryana government.
 
 “The water level at Wazirabad pond has fallen to 671.3 feet against the normal of 674.5 feet. There is also a reduction in release of raw water by Haryana in Delhi Sub-Branch and Munak canals, which has severely affected the production at water treatment plants. Therefore, water will be available at a low pressure for the coming few days, till the situation improves,” a DJB official said.
 
 The vice-chairman of DJB and MLA from Sangam Vihar Dinesh Mohania said supply has been curtailed by 70MGD and water rationing is being carried out so that the impact is minimal. 
 
 “We have been witnessing 30-50MGD reduction in supply due to rise in ammonia levels in Yamuna. Now, the pollution levels have reduced, but the pondage level cannot be maintained. We cannot draw water from below as it will contain silt. The time taken for improvement in situation depends on stance of Haryana as water is released every 8-9 hours,” Mohania said.
 
 The affected areas would cover most of Delhi except trans-Yamuna areas. “West, north, central Delhi, part of south Delhi, including Delhi Cantt and NDMC areas will be affected” Additionally , due to leakage inside the command tank No. 2, water supply would be affected or available at low pressure on Wednesday from 9am to 12am in Dwarka Sub City, Madhu Vihar, Rajapuri, Mahavir Enclave, Bindapur, among other areas.
