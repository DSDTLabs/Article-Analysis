LUCKNOW: Defending   against the charge that it had accommodated many “dynastic” claimants in its list of candidates, BJP president   said the   principle applied to leadership positions.

 “If Rahul Gandhi is married and blessed with a child, he or she would be a born potential chief minister and Prime Minister...that is what is meant by ‘parivarwad’,” he said on Saturday after releasing the party manifesto, adding that the same applied to SP. 
 
 “On the contrary, opportunities in our party are decided on merit and only after considering hard work irrespective of the family one belongs to,” said Shah.
 
 Shah said the alliance in UP can’t be equated with the “mahagathbandhan” that trounced BJP in Bihar as Samajwadi Party has joined hands with Congress, which he said is invisible in the state.
 
 BJP attacked the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance on Saturday saying it was an effort to deceive the people of Uttar Pradesh as Akhilesh Yadav had failed to deliver and had no answers over non-performance and poor law and order.
 
 “Yeh gathbandhan karke Uttar Pradesh ki janta ki aankho mein dhool nahi jhok sakte (They can’t bamboozle people of the state by this alliance),” said Shah, while unveiling BJP’s manifesto “Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra-2017”.
 
 Shah made it a point to argue that the addition of Congress was not resulting in any gains for SP. 
 
 “Samajwadi Party plus Congress means Samajwadi Party...as Congress is a big zero in the state,” he said.
 
 He said the party manifesto is about politics of performance and has no space for caste and community and BJP will work to take Uttar Pradesh out of the listing of BIMARU states, as has happened with Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where BJP is in office.
