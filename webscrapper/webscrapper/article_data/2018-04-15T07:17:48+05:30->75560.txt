 PUNE: From Monday, vehicles travelling on   on the Khadki lane will not be allowed to turn left towards Bhau Patil Road, as   will begin civil work on Metro pillars. 
 
 The work will begin on Bhau Patil Road, near the end of   Bridge. Commuters who would usually take Bhau Patil Road to reach Aundh have been urged to use either of the two flyovers, located at Dapodi and Nashik Phata.
 
 MahaMetro officials and traffic police officers have clarified that the Harris Bridge will remain open for vehicles travelling towards Khadki and Pune. The afore-mentioned restrictions will only be applicable to those vehicles that take a turn towards Aundh via Bhau Patil Road.
 
  
 MahaMetro officials said that they would put up barricades at the site on Sunday and the turn towards Bhau Patil Road will be closed to traffic from Monday. 
 
 An Official added that steps have been initiated to put up signage along the road between   and Harris Bridge to spread awareness among road users on the restrictions and in doing so, prevent confusion and chaos. All the necessary preparations will be done by Monday, officials said. 
 
 The work in question is part of the Metro rail work on the Pimpri to Range Hill stretch. MahaMetro has already extended the work, which includes construction of pillars and raising viaduct segments, up to Harris bridge.
 
 Meanwhile, the traffic police have issued guidelines stating that the road coming from Mumbai towards Bhau Patil Road will also remain closed for vehicles.
 
 “Vehicles that want to travel towards Aundh and Bhau Patil Road should make use of the flyover at Nashik Phata towards Pimple Gurav, and a bridge located at Phugewadi to reach Aundh,” a statement said. 
 
 The construction work on the pillar at Harris bridge is likely to consume the better part of the next two months.
