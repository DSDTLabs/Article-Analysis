MUMBAI: In a first-of-its-kind order, a   in the city has directed attachment of half the   of a divorced woman for failing to comply with a parenting plan. The plan required the woman to give her former husband access of their minor child for two hours thrice a month.

 A family court judge in Bandra on March 7 directed the attachment of salary for six months. The judge warned her that if she did not act on the consent terms, she may face further action, which can include arrest.
 
 The woman, who is in her 30s, and her husband divorced in 2015 and later arrived at a mutually agreed parental plan. For a year-and-a-half, the father, who pays child maintenance as directed, waited for her compliance before seeking execution of the order. The access was for three Saturdays every month for two hours. The custody of the child is with the mother and the father is now fighting for it.
 
 The court in its order said that in January the wife was “made aware of the fact that if she does not follow the parenting plan, coercive steps shall be taken against her person and property”. The man had moved for attachment of her salary and arrest as provided by law. His former wife failed to appear or reply to his plea in court.
