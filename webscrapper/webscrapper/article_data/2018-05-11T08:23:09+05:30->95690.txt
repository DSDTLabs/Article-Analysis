LUDHIANA: Some burglars targeted a house in Sector 38 of   in the wee hours of Thursday, and decamped with 120g gold and Rs 30,000 in cash by breaking open the almirahs. Family members of the house were sleeping at that time, and came to know about the theft only in the morning. On being informed,   police reached the spot, and suspected the involvement of a person familiar with the house, as the burglars had entered only one room — where gold and cash was kept — by breaking open a window grill.

 According to information, an elderly woman called   lives in the house with her daughter. On Thursday morning, they both saw the ransacked room and raised an alarm. Further, they accused their domestic help — hired about 20 days ago — of the theft. 
 
 The SHO at Jamalpur police station, sub-inspector  , said someone familiar with the house and the family could be involved in the theft. Apart from the new help hired 20 days ago, the family had two more domestic helps, who were living with the family for the past eight years. The police will investigate their roles and explore the case from all angles. The SI said they were tracing all the contacts of the domestic helps.
