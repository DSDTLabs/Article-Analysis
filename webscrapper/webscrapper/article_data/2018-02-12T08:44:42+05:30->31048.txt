RAJKOT: Bhavnagar police are hot on the trail of a woman and her aides who allegedly tried to extort a huge sum from a doctor by befriending him on   and luring him into a physical relationship.

 Dr   (45), who practises in Sanosara village near Bhavnagar, was trapped by a married woman named   alias Pooja from Palitana who first began chatting with him over WhatsApp. 
 
 On February 2, the doctor had gone to Palitana for some personal work. When Priti got to know, she called him at a friendâ€™s house. When both were alone in the room, the girl lured him into getting intimate. Just as she undressed herself, two persons barged into the room and began taking a video of the duo. They thrashed the doctor and threatened to fix him in a rape case. Later, they asked him for Rs 20 lakh in lieu of not lodging a rape complaint. After negotiations, it was decided that the doctor would pay them Rs 11 lakh on February 8 and let him go.
 
 Later, Dungrani, his wife and brother-in-law met the Bhavnagar superintendent of police and the probe was handed over to the local crime branch, which laid a trap to nab the accused.
 
 Dungrani was asked to come on   road with the cash. When he reached there, LCB sleuths nabbed the person identified as Ragha Aal, who had come to collect the money. 
 
 LCB sources said that they have launched a manhunt for Priti and another accomplice Bhagwan Aal.
