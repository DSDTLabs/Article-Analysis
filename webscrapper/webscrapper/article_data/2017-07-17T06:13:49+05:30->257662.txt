MYSURU: Karnataka CM   on Sunday warned bureaucrats against indiscipline and said the government will act tough with such officers.
The CM told reporters here that bureaucrats, including police officers, should maintain discipline and not indulge in anything that violates it. Making it clear he will not remain a silent spectator, the CM said the government will probe the charges of corruption and alleged special treatment to VIP inmates at Central Jail. The CM was speaking in the backdrop of the con troversy over DIG (Prisons) D   raising the issue of alleged preferential treatment to VIP prisoners in the Bengaluru prison in a report to her higher-ups. Roopa's report prompted the state government to announce a highlevel probe into the affairs in the prison on Thursday.
 
 The Siddaramaiah-led government also slapped a notice on Roopa on how her communication to her high er-ups was leaked to the media. An undeterred Roopa, however, submitted a second report on the dismal state of affairs in the prison on Saturday. The woman police officer had pointed to alleged preferential treatment to AIADMK leader V K   and stamp paper scam kingpin  .
 
 The woman officer's visits to the prison tur ned out stormy, dividing prisoners into two groups: One supporting her allegations and another criticizing her. At least 32 prisoners were moved out of Bengaluru prison on Saturday after the two groups clashed.
