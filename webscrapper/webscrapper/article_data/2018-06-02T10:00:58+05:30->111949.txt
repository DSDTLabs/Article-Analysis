KOCHI:   district collector   said that during the phase-two expansion of  , they would consider providing parking spaces for private vehicles, which bring passengers to the hub.

 Providing provision for parking spaces is essential to encourage people to use public transport system.
 
 Speaking about why the hub would play a bigger role in improving the public transport system in Kochi, he said: “The expansion of   to Vyttila will be a game changer. The availability of space for KSRTC buses at the hub could also be examined during the second phase.”
 
 Observing the first Friday of the month as Public Transport Day, the collector took a ferry ride along with Ernakulam regional transport officer (RTO) from the hub to Kakkanad. The feasibility of a feeder service to the Vyttila-Kakkanad ferry was a subject discussed by the team.
 
 D Dhanuraj, chairman of   (CPPR), said: “The Vyttila-Kakkanad ferry service had a daily ridership of 600 people during the initial stages when it was supported by a KMRL feeder system. One way to bring in more commuters would be to alter bus routes and recreate a feeder service for them. We will talk to private bus operators and the deputy transport commissioner regarding this,” he said.
 
 It is pointed out that dredging a stretch of 1.8 km further from the Kakkanad jetty would allow ferries to go till Infopark road. Currently, one ferry operates on this route. Increasing service frequency through privatisation could be successful as proven by the private bus service, said Dhanuraj.
 
 The collector also launched the project of pasting stickers to generate awareness about public transport. He also awarded the ‘Sreshta Sanchari Puraskaaram’ to the most frequent Metro commuters in May at the hub.
