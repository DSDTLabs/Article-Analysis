THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former CPM   has urged chief minister   and speaker P Sreeramakrishnan to withdraw the complaint registered against six   MLAs for damaging the properties of state assembly. 

 In a request sent to both, Sivankutty has said that the then   government and the speaker had acted in a partisan manner and had registered cases against the LDF MLAs. Hence, the government should consider withdrawing the case, he appealed.
 
 It is learnt that the chief minister has forwarded the request to the law department. 
 
 It was on March 13, 2015 that the LDF MLAs obstructed the budget presentation of K M Mani alleging his involvement in the bar bribery scam. A pandemonium was created in the assembly and the speaker was even not allowed to enter the House by the LDF MLAs.
 
 The MLAs damaged the speaker's chamber and destroyed the computer and other equipment. A loss to the tune of Rs 2 lakh was estimated then and a case was registered against six MLAs for damaging the property. 
 
 The case were registered against V Sivankutty, E P Jayarajan, K T Jaleel, C K Sadasivan, K Ajith and Kunjuahmmad Master. "Everyone has the right to submit a plea for withdrawing cases registered against him. It is, after all, a politically motivated case," Sivankutty said. Opposition leader   warned that any move from the government to withdraw the case will be dealt legally. "It was a shameful act and a black day for democracy. The state had never before witnessed such an incident," he said.
