Trichy: The city corporation has allotted Rs 56 lakh to desilt 20 major drainage canals running across the ahead of the north east monsoon.

 Apart from silt deposit, these canals are choked with plastic waste dumped by residents living along it. While illegal dumping of construction debris is rampant in these canals, the city may witness floods if the canal is unable to drain the water out of the city. 
 
 The civic body has chosen 20 narrow and wide canals in the city for desilting and expect to complete the work before the onset of north east monsoon in October. Work has been halted on a few stretches owing to the pre monsoon showers.
 
 The major canals that are undergoing desilting include Samba, Rettai, Kottai, Pirattiyur and Kathirikai canals. The work is being carried out based on the instructions from collector K Rajamani who is also assessing the progress of the work.
 
 “More than the silt, garbage in terms of plastic waste is choking the canal. Besides, illegal dumping of construction debris in the canal too would act as a barrier to preventing free flow of rain water,” said executive engineer S Amudhavalli.
 
 While weather experts have already forecast a good monsoon this year, it has now become important to clear the canal way to evacuate rain water, she said. 
 
 Though rain has been playing spoil game, Amudhavalli said, “Work is temporarily halted at such places to allow water to recede and work will be resumed again. We are expecting to complete the work ahead of the monsoon.”
