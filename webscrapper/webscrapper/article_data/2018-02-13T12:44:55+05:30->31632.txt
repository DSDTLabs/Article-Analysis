Coimbatore: Naga Annapoorani, a class IX student at a government high school in Pollachi, was finding it difficult to contain her excitement on Monday. “This is the first time I am going to visit a space research centre,” she said, smiling.

 She was part of the 100 class IX students from government schools in and around the city, who have been selected for an educational trip to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre at Thumba, Thiruvananthapuram. The initiative was taken up by the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), a scheme under the ministry of human resource development, to expose students from government schools to science and technology.
 
 On Monday, the students gathered on the grounds of the Government Girls High School on  , for a briefing session by education officials and RMSA officials.
 
 RMSA has selected 100 students each from 100 government schools in and around the city, said KKannan, its assistant district project co-ordinator. “We had asked the headmasters and headmistresses to nominate one student each from their schools for the trip,” said  .
 
 Students said though they had read about space science and rockets, they had never dreamt of going to a space research station. “Rocket man APJ   had worked at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, which makes this trip even more special,” said Naga Annapoorani.
 
 “I’m very excited about the trip. I can’t even imagine what to expect at a space research station,” said  , another student.
 
 Former president APJ Abdul Kalam had launched RMSA scheme in 2015, said Kannan. “Under the scheme, we took 20 students to   Satellite Centre in Bengaluru,” he said.
 
 “The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has arranged to take the students and has also arranged lodging for them in Thumba. RMSA has allotted Rs 2lakh for the trip. The students will leave for Thumba on Monday night and come back on Thursday,” he said. Six teachers and IRCTC officials will accompany them.
