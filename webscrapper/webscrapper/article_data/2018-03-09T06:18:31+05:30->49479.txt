CHENNAI: Owners of   registered before 1989 located in areas under the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) can directly approach their respective local bodies for   without applying through the online portal for unauthorised plots, and the local bodies can process them, the   clarified on Thursday.

 The development comes in the wake of complaints that local bodies were refusing to process applications for regularising unapproved plots registered before December 31, 1989, citing the Regularisation of Unapproved Plots and Layouts Rules, 2017, which came into effect on May 4, 2017.
 
 In a recent letter, the planning authority has said that the delegation of powers to the local bodies for the purpose has not been withdrawn, allowing local bodies to continue processing applications seeking regularisation of unapproved plots registered before 1989.
