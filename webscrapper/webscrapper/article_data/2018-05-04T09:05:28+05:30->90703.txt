KOLKATA:   is gearing up to tighten its control over the   offering   in their respective campuses. In the next syndicate meeting, CU authorities will discuss a proposal to introduce   for all affiliated institutes.

 
 When a college applies for a PG programme, CU determines the syllabus for the first three years. After this, the colleges have the autonomy to frame their own curriculum with approval from the university. However, there is a discrepancy between the syllabus being followed by the PG departments in CU and in the colleges, resulting in ‘qualitative deterioration’.
 
 “Random permissions to open PG courses in colleges have diluted curriculum. Though the gross enrolment ratio has increased, the quality of PG teaching and evaluation has deteriorated,” a CU teacher said.
 
 “Moreover, there is lack of infrastructure. Colleges running UG courses in saturated mode are trying to introduce PG courses with the same capacity,” she added.
 
 VC Sonali Chakraborti Bandopadhyay said, “In the next syndicate meet we will propose uniform syllabi for PG courses run by colleges and discuss CU framing the questions and deciding on the exam schedule for PG exams in colleges.”
