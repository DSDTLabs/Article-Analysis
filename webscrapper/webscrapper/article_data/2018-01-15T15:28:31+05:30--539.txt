NEW DELHI: The rift between the   (CJI) and four senior   judges has been "laid to rest," the   (BCI) said on Monday.

 
 "As you can see, the 
  and all courts rooms in the Supreme Court are functioning normally," ANI quoted BCI chairman Manan Mishra as saying.
 
 Mishra reiterated that the rift was as "internal issue" and had been resolved.
 
 A seven-member delegation of the BCI had met CJI   on Sunday, and after the meeting had assured that the crisis in the Supreme Court will be sorted out soon.
 
  
  
 
 "We met CJI in a congenial atmosphere, everything will be sorted out. Bar council's role is very limited, judges have assured it there will be no problem at all," Mishra told mediapersons after the 50-minute-long meeting.
 
 On Friday, in an unprecedented move, four senior Supreme Court judges - Justice  , Justice  , Justice Madan Lokur and Justice   - had publicly expressed their grievances against the CJI and had alleged irregularities within the apex court.
