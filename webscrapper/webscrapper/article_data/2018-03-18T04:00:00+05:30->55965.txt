Rajkot: A farmer suffered fracture in his hands and feet when he was attacked by loan sharks with iron pipes and bats in Saraya village of Tankara taluka in Morbi district on Friday night. According to the complaint lodged by victim’s son Sagar Dhedhi, his father Odhavji Dhedhi (57) was attacked by Ramji Varu, his brother and his associates when he went to till his farm. “Sagar said Odhavji had taken Rs 5 lakh loan on interest from Varu and had already paid Rs 15 lakh to him till date. Odhavji had deposited the ownership documents of his land to Varu as security against the loan. However, after Odhavji cleared the loan, Varu refused to return the documents to him. Tired of repeated demands to no avail, Odhavji decided to go to his farm for tilling. When Varu came to know about this, he and the other accused attacked Odhavji,” a police official said.
