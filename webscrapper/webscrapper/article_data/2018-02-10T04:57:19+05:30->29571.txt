ULHASNAGAR: Konark co-operative bank ex-CEO   has been booked for allegedly tampering with a customer's account and sanctioning an overdraft facility of nearly Rs 26 crore to 16 companies by forging documents. Makhija was booked under IPC sections related to cheating and   after bank customer Nirmal Bhatia approached Central police station on Thursday and submitted documents allegedly forged by Makhija. 

 Bhatia said that he and his partners, Satish and Harish Harchabi, have an account at the bank and an overdraft facility of Rs 6 crore. He had pledged property documents with the bank too. Bhatia alleged that Makhija misused the documents and tampered with his account to fraudulently sanction the amount under the overdraft facility, police said. The "fraud" has been going on since March 2015 but he noticed it only recently.
 
 Inspector Shashank Meher said an FIR was being registered and action will be initiated after a detailed probe. 
 
 Makhija told TOI he had quit his post six months back and he had been falsely implicated by the complainant as he had sealed his property for not paying dues of Rs 13 crore. Makhija said the complainant gave 22 other bank employees' names in the complaint but the FIR was being registered only against him. A bank director said, "Police are being one-sided without hearing us though we have not done anything wrong." Pradeep Gupta
