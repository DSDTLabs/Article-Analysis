After being criticised for his controversial remarks on sexual harassment in  , actor   said that he vows to spend more time listening and less time talking.

  
  
 In an interview, when he was asked what he'd learn from the criticism of his comments, the 47-year-old actor replied, "I really wish I'd listened a lot more before I weighed in on this. I don't want to further anybody's pain with anything that I do or said. So for that, I am really sorry."
 
  The   star also noted that he loves and respects the women that are coming ahead and speaking about their horrific experiences with the #TimesUp movement.
 
  "[With]  , a lot of those women are my dear friends, and I love them and respect them and support what they're doing," explained Damon.
 
  He concluded his comments by saying that he wants to be a part of the change that has been happening in the industry but feels that he should take a backseat for a while and keep his mouth shut.
 
  This response comes after Damon said in an interview that while he finds it   that women are speaking out against their alleged perpetrators, there is a 'continuum' with respect to questionable behaviour.
 
  At that time he said, "I think it's wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it's totally necessary. I do believe there's a spectrum of behaviour.
 
  There's a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn't be conflated."
 
  Actresses   and Damon's   co-star   were among the high-profile Hollywood women to criticize the actor's comments.
