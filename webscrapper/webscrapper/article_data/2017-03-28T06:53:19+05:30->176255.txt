AHMEDABAD: A Rajkot-based businessman who has suffered renal failure approached the Gujarat high court to clear the legal hurdles after his neighbour expressed willingness to donate her kidney to him.

  suffers from end-stage renal disease and urgently needs a kidney transplant. His immediate neighbour, Anjana Pandhi, agreed to donate her kidney out of compassion, he claims.
 
 Vagadiya made an application on January 21 to the authorization committee for permission to receive the organ from his neighbour, but the committee sat tight over his application. The norms for organ donation are more stringent, under section 9(5) of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, when the donor is not a blood relative of the recipient. This is because the authorities check whether the donor has been lured into donating the organ for money.
 
 Because the authorization committee did not respond to his application, Vagadiya moved the HC through advocate  . The advocate submitted that the donor is not a close relative of the recipient, but on account of affection and attachment towards her neighbour and his family, she agreed to donate her kidney to Vagadiya.
 
 As soon as he filed the petition, the committee took up his case and scrutinized it. The advocate said the committee concluded that this is not a case of inducement by offering money to the donor.
 
 As the proceedings began in the HC, the issue of the medical opinion arose. After performing the required tests, one Dr   in Ahmedabad, who is treating Vagadiya opined that the transplant was possible. However, Sterling Hospital in Rajkot gave a negative opinion.
 
 As the medical opinions differed, the high court last week advised Vagadiya and Pandhi to consult a listed hospital and obtain a third opinion. There are 12 listed hospitals in Gujarat whose medical opinion is considered by the authorities in cases of organ transplantation.
 
 The high court shall further hear the matter on April 10.
