GURUGRAM: A 22-year-old engineering student allegedly committed suicide by   off the   of an 11-storeyed apartment building in Sector 47 on Friday evening.

 Manuj Mehta was a final-year computer science   student of Northcap University. He lived with his step father and mother at Uniworld Garden in Sector 47. Around 5.10 pm on Friday, Manuj is believed to have gone to the terrace of the building of his house and jumped off. He lived with his parents on the third floor.
 
 After Manuj fell on the ground, a security guard stationed on the premises saw his body and informed the estate office. Soon his mother was informed. By the time, the police had also arrived. He was taken to a nearby private hospital, but was declared brought dead.
 
 Police said Manuj’s body has been handed over to his family members after an autopsy on Saturday. A resident of the society, who did not wish to be named, said Manuj had been suffering from depression which might have been the cause of his decision to kill self. However, no suicide note has been found.
 
 Sources told TOI that Manuj had stopped going to the university since last April and was undergoing treatment for depression. A police officer investigating the case said that no FIR had been registered as there was no reason to suspect foul play. “The proceedings were made under Section 174 of CrPC (police to enquire and report on suicide),” he said.
 
 (An earlier version of this report had erroneously stated that the student jumped from the university building. The error is regretted.)
