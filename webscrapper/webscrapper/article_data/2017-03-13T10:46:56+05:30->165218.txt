INDORE: The Indore municipal corporation ( ) in a bid to make   free of   has started work of laying underground ducts at  . The work on the stretch would cost Rs 9 crore. 

 With his initiative roads become free from all overhead cables and electricity lines. Each duct will be of 3 by 3 feet. Pipelines of storm water drainage and drinking water will also run through them. They will be constructed at an interval of 20 to 30 feet on both sides of the road. The ducts will be like manholes that can be easily opened for all sorts of maintenance.
 
 While preparing ducts is also a costly affair, officials claimed that in long run it would be cost effective. Officials said that this is a pilot project. Biyabani area has been chosen for beginning the work since civic supply lines here are lying in dilapidated condition.
 
 The IMC had received suggestions to create an underground passage for all cables and electric wires. However, the officials had said that the suggestions were infeasible for a city like Indore.
 
 "We are not setting up a new city. While giving a makeover to an old city like Indore, we will have to face certain restrictions. So, we have thought of creating ducts at regular intervals," IMC additional commissioner Rohan Saxena.
 
 However, replicating the model across the Smart City will be a real challenge for the IMC since the 742-acre area includes Rajwada, Satha Bazaar, Bada Sarafa and Chhota Sarafa, which are very congested places.
