NEW DELHI: Five days after a 30-year-old   was allegedly   by a group of policemen when his car brushed against their patrol vanin Prashant Vihar,   three personnel on Wednesday and started a departmental inquiry against them.

 “An assistant sub-inspector and two constables have been sent to the district lines,” said Rishi Pal, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini).
 
 A huge group of protesters, including victim Amit Jindal’s relatives and friends, had been protesting outside the Prashant Vihar police station since the past two days, alleging police inaction.
 
 On early Friday when Jindal was returning home, he had a heated argument with two policemen after his car hit theirs at Rohini Sector 14. The DCP earlier said the policemen called the control room for help. Jindal alleged that two more policemen arrived and thrashed him a little before taking him for a medical examination.
 
 “Jindal was heavily drunk and that led to the accident,” Pal had claimed, adding that the test confirmed that he was drunk.
 
 The police said Jindal had abrasions only on his hands. But after the test, he was allegedly taken to the police station and thrashed again. “They switched off my phone and demanded Rs 1 lakh to let me go. In the morning, my family had to give them Rs 60,000,” Jindal alleged. As evidence, he showed blue and black marks on his limbs and back.
