NEW DELHI: The   ( ) has observed that it may take action against the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) as well as coal-based thermal power plants in case they don’t implement the   standards set by them for these plants to control pollution.

 A bench headed by Justice Jawad Rahim made the remarks on Monday while hearing a petition moved by   activist Sunil Dahiya in May last year. The bench also questioned the suggestions made on behalf of the ministry to form a committee to assess the implementation process.
 
 “Having issued the notification, its enforcement is the primary and statutory duty of the ministry itself through its instrumentality. That has not been done till now,” the order said.
 
 The counsel of the ministry was further asked to ensure compliance of the directions in notification by the thermal plants concerned and file the report within a week when the case is heard again on September 18.
 
 In 2015, MoEFCC had set January 1 and December 7, 2017 as deadlines for new and existing coal-based thermal power plants to reduce air pollution emissions and high water consumption by them.
 
 The case filed by Dahiya challenged the ministry for the lack of implementation of emission standard   for coal power plants in May 2016. The notification issued by the ministry had expected these power plants to retrofit their power generating units with pollution control equipment and devices that reduce emission of particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and mercury which pose hazards to public health and environment. The notification also seeks steps by these plants to reduce water consumption.
