Surat: The income tax (I-T) department has started a survey on the provision shop at Lambe Hanuman Road after the owner failed to revert to the notice seeking explanation for depositing Rs 35 lakh in old currency in the bank account. 

 Official sources said that over 2,500 notices were issued by the department to those who had deposited scrapped currency above Rs 1 crore in their respective bank accounts. An additional 1,000 notices were served to those who had deposited over Rs 15 lakh in old currency in their bank accounts. 
 
 Sources said that most of the individuals have deposited over Rs 1 crore in old currencies in the bank account after demonitization from Vapi, Surat and Vadodara. The highest depositers are from Surat. Around, 20 to 25 cases related to Kishore Bhajiawala are also being scrutinized by the department. 
 
 The department had sent online notices to the tax assessees for high value deposit in old currency in the last two months. 
 
 Sources said that most of the addresses given by the assessees are bogus and that the department has started seeking reply from the respective banks regarding the details of the account holders.
