SC case has already been withdrawn as court directed us to approach Upper   Board (UYRB).   case was on pollution and excess ammonia flowing in raw water, which is no longer the case. Therefore, we are withdrawing it with option of again approaching NGT if ammonia level rises,” Mohania said.
 
 He argued that DJB is “not a party, but only a respondent in the high court case on a PIL therefore, all the cases against Haryana would stand withdrawn as far as DJB is concerned.” 
 
 Haryana on Wednesday’s UYRB meeting had sought assurance of cases being withdrawn in return of   guarantee till the advent of monsoons in July. Sources in the government said the current move is to ensure no curtailment of supply occurs in June when the demand in the capital will soar.
 
 DJB officials said Delhi continues to face a shortage of 30-50 MGD water from Haryana, which supplies it to capital from Yamuna, DSB and CLC canals.
