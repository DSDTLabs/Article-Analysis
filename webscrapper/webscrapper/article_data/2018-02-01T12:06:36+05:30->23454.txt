BENGALURU:   working president Dinesh Gundu Rao has been the most aggressive in the party when it comes to countering the  . In a chat with TOI, Rao says the poison of communalism is destroying society.

 
 
 
 Shah’s statement only shows he has no confidence in his state party chief, B S Yeddyurappa. The former chief minister was seen literally bending to touch the Shah’s feet, a man 20 years his junior. It smacks of a ‘me- too’ category. Our campaign will be under chief minister Siddaramaiah. Our leader is not tainted apart from some wild allegations made by the BJP.

 This is a bogey which is the creation of the BJP. They need an alternative narrative to justify their divisive agenda. The Congress is against fundamental groups. It is going alone. The BJP has used the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen in UP.
 
 
 
 
 The Congress’s Hindutuva is the version advocated by Mahatama Gandhi, who was a deeply religious person. When he died his last words were ‘Hey Ram’. But the person who killed him was a believer of a radical version of Hindutva.
 
 
 
 
 The BJP has been saying that Hindus have been denied opportunities and benefits. When Dalits or OBCs are given benefits, why is it not appreciated by them? They are also Hindus.

The statement from Vishwa Hindu Parishad justifying the killing of M Basheer in Dakshina Kannada is made only because there is nobody to stop them. The BJP is keeping mum to such statements and PM   does not make a mention of it in his Man Ki Baat. It sends the message that they have the support.
