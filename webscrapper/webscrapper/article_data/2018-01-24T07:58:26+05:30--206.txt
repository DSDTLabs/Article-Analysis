CHENNAI: Chennai Water Desalination Plant Ltd (CWDL) is finding it difficult to pay the dues on its loan of ₹3,780 crore, said India Ratings. In a city, which reeled from a water crisis last year, the operation of   is vital — as it is the special purpose vehicle for design, operation and maintainence of the 100MLD seawater desalination plant at Minjur, about 35km north of Chennai.

 Operational since July 2010, the Minjur plant has a capacity to produce 100 MLD (million liters per day) of desalinated water from 273 million litres of sea water using reverse osmosis. Built on a 60-acre site, it is the largest desalination plant in India -- which is currently seeing lower revenue from operations.
 
 CWDL’s operating revenue has fallen 7.6% to ₹1,827.48 crore this year from ₹1,979.21last year. This has resulted in a fall in come of 6.4% to ₹1,863 crore in full-year 2017 from ₹1,992.39 crore in FY16.
 
 In its report, affirming the ‘D’ rating — instruments with this rating are in default or are expected to be in default soon — for the senior project bank loans to the tune of ₹3,780 crore, India Ratings, said “affirmation reflects CWDL’s continued delays in debt servicing due to a tight liquidity position. During December 2016-October 2017, receivable period from the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) was 13 days and average collection efficiency was 96%.”
 
 “Timely debt servicing for three consecutive months would be positive for the ratings,” said India Ratings in its report. IVRCL had won the competitive bid during the AIADMK government’s reign in 2004 and signed a bulk water purchase agreement with CMWSSB or Metrowater in September 2005. In 2006, it was asked by the ruling DMK Government to reduce the price of water. Apart from the cost of running the project, the company has also been seeing lower revenue year-on-year.
 
 The project which was originally scheduled for January 2009, eventually inaugurated in July 2010. Later, IVRCL also had differences with its partner Befesa too.
