PUDUCHERRY: The department of food safety has directed those who own or operate food businesses (small hoteliers and  ), not to use   to wrap, cover or serve food items, as it contains   chemicals. 

 Deputy food safety commissioner G L Upadhyaya sought them to use alternatives such as plantain leaves, aluminium foils and organically sourced disposable plates (made of plant origin).
 
 He said newspapers, and cardboards made of recycled paper might contain traces of metallic contaminants, mineral oils and harmful chemicals like phthalates that can cause digestive issues and lead to severe toxicity. People with compromised vital organs and immune system are at a greater risk of acquiring cancer-related health complications if they are exposed to food packed or served in such materials, he said.
 
 “Food contaminated by newspaper ink raises serious concerns since the ink contains multiple bioactive materials with known negative health effects. Printing inks may also contain harmful colours, binders, additives and preservatives. Besides chemical contaminants, the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in used newspapers also poses a potential risk to human health,” Upadhyaya explained, asking vendors to avoid their use.
