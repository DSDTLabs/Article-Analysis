Vadodara: Startling revelations have surfaced during investigation into murder of Arunkumar Balaswami allegedly by his 17-year-old friend. During interrogation of the minor accused police have learnt that he had killed Balaswami because he used to blackmail him with a bawdy video clip. Police sources said that during interrogation, the boy admitted that Balaswami and other friends used to take his money and ask him to do all work using the video. According to the boy, Balaswami had stripped him of his clothes when he was unconscious after consuming drugs and shot the video. Whenever all friends used to meet, Balaswami used to blackmail him to get water, snacks and cigarettes.  He also told the cops that he was undergoing counselling to withdraw himself from addiction of drugs. On Friday when Balaswami and two other friends went to meet him at his home, he thought they will beat him and since he was frustrated with them, he had decided to kill him. Thus on Friday when the accused boy and Balaswami were going out of his residential society on latter’s bike, he slit his throat. The police are, however, not entirely convinced by the boy’s admission. A police official said that they will take statements of their other friends to verify whether the accused is saying the truth. Besides, they will also check Balaswami’s mobile phone if the video which the accused is referring to really exists or not.
