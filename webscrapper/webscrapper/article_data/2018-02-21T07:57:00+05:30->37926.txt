Ludhiana: A DDR (daily diary report) was filed against Congress leader Kamaljit Singh Karwal and another leader Gurpreet Gopi under non-cognizable sections for an alleged attack on Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief and Atam Nagar MLA Simarjit Singh Bains on Tuesday. ADCP Surinder Lamba confirmed the news and said that not FIR but a DDR was filed against the Congress leaders.

 The LIP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders had decided to hold a protest march from Gulmohar Hotel on Ferozepur Road till police commissionerâ€™s office on Tuesday for attacking him Simarjit. In fact, party workers had gathered at the site in a large number. However, after getting assurance from the police, the LIP and AAP leaders have rolled back their protest.
 
 The Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira, co-president Aman Arora, MLA Jagraon Sarabjit Kaur Manuke and LIP MLAs Simarjit and Balwinder Bains addressed the party workers, who had gathered at the site. The leaders alleged that ruling party was misusing the government machinery for their selfish means and Congress leaders even attacked Simarjit.
 
 They claimed they wanted fair and peaceful elections so they had met the election commissioner as well but it hardly served the purpose. They told the party workers that FIR will be registered against the Congress leaders and suitable action will also be taken against them and the party members should gear up for the elections.
 
 Meanwhile, given the presence of party leaders and workers in large number on Ferozepur Road, vehicles were parked on side of the road and two lanes were blocked. It added to the woes of the commuters, who had to wait for a longer time to reach their destination.
 
 On February 18, Simarjit had alleged that he was attacked by Congress leaders at his office. The leaders of both parties even staged a protest at CP office
