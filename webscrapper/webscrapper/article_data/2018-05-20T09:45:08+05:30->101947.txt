CHENNAI: At least 15 spotted   are set to be rendered homeless with workers beginning to clear the open space on the   campus in  , where they frolicked, to make way for new buildings. 

 When a TOI team visited the place on Saturday, a group of deer was peeking out of a clump of the   on the southern side as earthmovers began devouring the greenery on the northern part. Staff at the   said the din created by the earthmovers was set to affect the deer, some of whom were born a few days ago.
 
 Naturalists said all the deer should be trapped and rehabilitated properly, as done in Taramani, before they attempt to scamper out and face the risk of being struck by passing vehicles. 
 
 While B Chandramohan, principal secretary of the   department under which the Tamil Virtual Academy functions, said he would comment on the clearing of the campus on his return, naturalists say the process was irreversible as the electricity department had built concrete structures to house transformers and that wildlife department officials should begin preparations for translocating the deer.
 
 While moving spotted deer, which are shy animals, from one place to another is hazardous and could sometimes prove fatal, wildlife authorities have successfully moved out several of the animals from within private properties in the city in the last few years. 
 
 On the last occasion, however, a deer died while being relocated from Taramani.
