The popularity that is associated with the small screen is immense and it was testified once again when the cast and crew of the highly-rated daily soap   was in   over the weekend. The group was in the fort city to participate in a mega programme, titled Serial Santhe, that was exclusively held to interact with fans of this daily soap. “And the size of the crowd that turned up, left us stunned, too. It was overwhelming to see the kind of following the serial has,” says a source from the channel. The evening saw all the characters of the serial including Radha, Raman, Aditya and Anvitha take the stage with a variety of entertaining acts. And what’s a show without a good cause attached to it? Inmates of a local orphanage were not only invited to witness the spectacle, but also presented with goodies by their favourite actors from the serial. Needless to add, Serial   left its fans with pleasant memories for a long time to come.
