Trichy: More discordant notes are being heard in the ruling AIADMK with each passing day as chief minister E Palaniswamy tries to consolidate his position in the party as well as government. On Saturday, sitting MLA and former transport minister V   sprung a surprise by alleging that the ruling party and the police were in cahoots to violate the Supreme Court order banning liquor shops on highways. 

 It was only a couple of days ago that minister Sellur K Raju claimed that the AIADMK had become a laughing stock as the party lacked a proper leadership after the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. Balaji who once wielded considerable clout in the party as well as in his district Karur, said, “The Supreme Court had ruled that liquor shops within 500 metres of national and state highways would have to shut down. However, the ruling party with the help of the police has been allowing the sale of liquor at the same spot in the name of restaurants”, he alleged. However, transport minister and AIADMK district secretary M R Vijayabaskar refuted the charges later at a press briefing. “His allegations are baseless. There is no chance for that. If so, action will be taken", he said.
 
 Balaji’s controversial statement was made while briefing reporters at an event held at Punjai Thottakuruchi village which falls under Aravakuruchi assembly constituency in Karur. He urged chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to take action to close down the illegal liquor sale as it had become a nuisance for the residents and the general public. He also lamented that neither officials from the education department nor the district administration were heeding his demand to distribute free cycles to students in his assembly constituency. “No one has invited me to the free cycle distribution function held at a school in Pujai Pugalur which comes under my constituency,” he further stated.
