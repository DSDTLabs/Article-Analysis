VADODARA: Now, you won’t have to travel all the way to any African country for a wildlife safari. A safari is coming right in the backyard of Vadodara . The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has planned a wildlife safari on a huge piece of land in Ajwa – about 20 km away from the city. Work on the safari park has started and the civic body expects to throw it open for public in six months. 

 “This will be a unique safari park wherein people will be taken around in vehicles. We will bring in animals that are not usually seen in India. It has been designed on the lines of African safari model,” said Dr Vinod Rao, municipal commissioner. He said that the project is based on public-private participation so VMC won’t have to spend any money for it.
 
 VMC officials said that herbivorous animals will be kept in the safari park that has been made as per the norms of the   (CZA). The civic body had earlier planned to shift the Sayajibaug zoo to Ajwa but the project didn’t work out.
