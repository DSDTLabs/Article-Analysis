AMRITSAR: At first sight, Rajbir Singh (40) looks likes any other poverty-stricken rickshaw puller on the street, but what makes him different from others is his philanthropist work. Strange as it may sound, but a person who barely manages to make ends meet has   for others, paid the school fee of two poor school students, occasionally pays for the   of patients, and has a ‘golak’ ( ) for on-the-spot help to needy people. If that is not enough, Rajbir has written over a dozen articles in a vernacular newspaper, and also authored a book, ‘Rickshay tae chaldi zindagi’.

 Rajbir, a high school passout, said people’s miseries motivate him to help others. “I have met very rich people, but a majority of them do not want to part with even a single rupee to help others. Thankfully, I may be poor, but I have a big heart,” he said with pride.
 
 Father of two teenaged sons -- Simranjit and Ravinder -- Rajbir claimed to have helped as many as five fellow workers buy rickshaws. “Many rickshaw pullers hire rickshaws on a rent of Rs150 a day, which leaves them with hardly anything for themselves, so I decided to help some of them to buy rickshaws.” He also claimed he helped two poor students of a government school by paying their school fee.
 
 When asked how he managed to sustain and help others with a meagre income of around Rs300 a day, he replied: “I just need to feed my family, but I make sure to save ‘dasvandh’ (one-tenth) of my income. A few of my regular customers who know my work contribute to my social work, and this is how I manage it.”
 
 Rajbir does not crib when there is no customer. Instead, he takes out his pen and paper, nicely tucked inside a small cavity made in his rickshaw, and starts writing.
