MUMBAI: From Wednesday midnight, police are likely to stop traffic movement under the damaged portion of  . The east-west traffic (Ghatkopar-Chembur) will instead be diverted to adjoining spans that have now been laid with asphalt. 

  The Thane-bound carriageway of the Amar Mahal flyover has been shut since Saturday after some of its joints were found to be damaged. The slipped joints are at the centre of the Thane-bound arm, which is right above the road that connects Chembur to   and vice versa. 
 
 A PWD official said, "Traffic from Ghatkopar to Chembur has already been diverted to the adjoining span. Chembur to Ghatkopar traffic is also likely to be diverted from midnight."
 
  Those travelling from Che- mbur to Ghatkopar or Ghatkopar to Chembur will take a left curve from under the flyover to go to the other side. 
 
 Experts said that closing of the road under the flyover is necessary as the bridge, which is being provided support, could cave in. Another official said, "There are chances that motorists or bikers may get injured if any part of the bridge falls off."
 
 Officials said that they have taken all the steps suggested by experts from IIT and   to strengthen the bridge. The PWD is in a fix over the repairs as there is lack of expertise on the bridge that was was built in 1995 using the unique Quadricon design. An official said that experts are studying the damage using advanced tools to figure out short-term and long-term solutions.
 
  Police have allocated a lane on the Sion-bound carriageway for those travelling towards Thane, but that has slowed down traffic movement, especially during peak hours. 
 
 PWD officials said the Thane arm is likely to remain shut for some more weeks as experts need time to submit a report, which will then be approved by authorities. Thereafter, process to appoint a contractor will begin.
