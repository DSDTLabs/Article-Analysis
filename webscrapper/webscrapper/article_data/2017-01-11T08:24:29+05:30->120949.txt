KOCHI: Merchants blame it on the lack of interest on part of the municipal authorities for the waste removal issue in Kalamassery. The rift between   in the local body play spoilsport in implementing the initiatives for  . 

 K M Hassan, of the merchants union of Kalamassery unit said, "The Haritha Keralam initiative of the state government has been introduced in the municipality, but there is nobody to implement it. Around 1000 shops including hotels, groceries and vegetable shops function in the local body limit. The plastic waste generated in Kalamassery every day is around two tonne".
 
 The vegetable waste generated in hotels are used in pig farms, plastic waste is taken by rag pickers and there are demand for chicken waste as handcrafts can be made from feathers, so the local body does not have much burden to endure. But the political rift among councillors takes a toll on the waste management in Kalamasserry, Hassan says.
 
 Gopalakrishnan, a merchant in the municipality limit says they have to wait for the mercy of the contingent workers of the municipality. "We have to pester councillors many times to remove waste near roadsides in our shops. The Kochi Metro construction adds to our woes. Even if waste is removed from an area, next day it will become a waste dumping yard. Metro workers also dump waste in public places", he said. The boards erected by health officials in the municipality are a most sought after waste dumping area in the municipality limit.
 
 "The problem is that we don't have a systematic waste management. People even dump waste in front of religious places. The other thing is that people dump waste during night escape being caught. There should be some system to nab such people", Capt Prem G Nath.
