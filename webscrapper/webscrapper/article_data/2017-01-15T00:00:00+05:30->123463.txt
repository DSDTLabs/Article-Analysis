The annual winter food fair, the  , which has been one of the must-visit events of Food Street, VV Puram, takes new steps in 2017. After expanding to a mini mela in   last year, this year there will be mini melas in Chandra Layout and  . Slated to take off later this month, these melas are being held because of insistence of the local MLAs following the popularity of the food festival. The other significant change is that most vendors have wholeheartedly embraced going cashless and are accepting e-wallet and card payments. 

 We managed to visit the food fest a week after its inauguration this year, with actors   and   accompanying us. Both of them are self-confessed fans of this bean that Bengaluru goes gaga over. The two sporting actors even tried their hand at making jalebis, dosas and obattus, apart from selling the famed avarekai congress mixture and the loose beans to customers, much to surprise and delight of visitors to the mela. 
 
 Samyuktha says, “I loved the obattu and halwa. It is so amazing that they make so many variants of food with avarekai. I also have full respect to the people in the kitchen. When I tried my hand at making a jalebi, I realized what an art it is.”
 
 Dhananjaya seemed to enjoy the savouries, especially the avarekai version of Gobi Manchurian, as well as the Avarekai Dosa and Avarekai Masalavade. “I look forward to this festival every year. I like the innovations and varieties,” he says.
