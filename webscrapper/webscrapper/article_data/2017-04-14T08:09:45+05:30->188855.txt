PATIALA:   farmers planning to set the crop residue in their fields on fire had better watch out. They are being watched from the skies. Four farmers of Patiala district got a taste of this reality when they were tracked real-time following an SMS alert from the   (PRSC), Ludhiana, to the district administration. A team of the Patiala SDM and enforcement wing of the   (PPCB) tracked them to their fields and challaned them for violating the norms.

 Punjab had recently started using geo-spatial data and satellite imagery to detect stubble burning. The project is the outcome of the December 10, 2015, orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the state to use remote sensing facilities to monitor and curb crop stubble burning. Though the state authorities had started using the services of the PRSC last year, it was for the first time that SMSs were being sent to district heads for immediate action.
 
 Patiala DC   said they had been alerted about some farmers of Bhasmara and Dulbha villages setting their fields on fire.. “The farmers were issued challans based on the acreage of their fields. “Patiala has been announced ‘zero-burning model district’ and challans were issued to the owners of the land irrespective of the fact whether these were being cultivated by farm contractors or not,” said the DC.
 
 The PPCB chairman, Manpreet Singh, said the board was monitoring the burning of crop residue using latest means. He said while the district authorities were responsible for taking action against the violators, the PPCB was collecting details from all district heads. He said details of the number of SMSs sent to the district heads and action taken would be put before the Central Pollution Control Board.
 
 Stubble burning by farmers in Punjab and Haryana had led to massive pollution in Delhi and the national capital region in last winter.
