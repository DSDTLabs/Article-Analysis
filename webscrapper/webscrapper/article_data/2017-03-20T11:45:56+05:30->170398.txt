NAGPUR: Bharat Mukti Morcha ( ) will be launching a five-phased   across the country from March 25 to press demand for discontinuing   (EVMs) in the electoral process.

 Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Waman Meshram, all India president of BMM, said, “Using EVMs is the worst practice in the electoral process in the world. We will continue to fight against EVMs till their usage is stopped,” said Meshram. 
 
 Meshram said that he had had filed a petition against the EC asking it to attach Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in the EVMs but it is being delayed deliberately. Delaying this is going to only help two organizations, the EC and the  . If we want to keep the democracy of our country alive, ballet papers must be used for election as they cannot be rigged,” he added.
 
 Talking about the petition filled in the Supreme Court, Meshram said, “I had filed a case of contempt of court against EC. The apex court in its verdict of October 8,2013, had clearly said that   machines can be fixed or rigged, so as a hard proof VVPAT machines must be attached to EVMs but the guidelines have not followed.” 
 
 Meshram also alleged that the EC is been pressured by the Central government to rig elections across the country. “The election commission in a reply to my letter said that the Centre is not providing funds to attach VVPAT machines, but the EC is an autonomous institution. It should have gone to the President or held a press conference as the citizens have the right to know,” he said.
 
 In the first phase, BMM will stage agitation for 72 hours, in the second phase a rally will be taken out across the city, in the third phase ‘Road Roko’ protest will be held, in fourth ‘Railway Roko’ and in the fifth phase rallies will be taken out across the district. Rajkumar Thorle, Kumar Ravikant, AS Pathan and others were present at the press conference.
