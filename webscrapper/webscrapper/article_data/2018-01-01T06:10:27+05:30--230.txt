MUMBAI: There might be an HC ban on bullock cart races in  , but the activity continues with impunity even around Mumbai. A video of one such race organised on a fairly busy road in   last Monday has gone viral. 

 Shakuntala Majumdar, president of Thane SPCA, an animal welfare organisation, approached the police on Sunday to complain about the race, which is in violation of court orders. "A volunteer who happened to be passing along that road shot this video," said Majumdar.
 
 The brief video shows bullock carts racing from Pleasant Park in Mira Road towards Bhayander. The video has also partially captured an accident that took place during the race. 
 
 "One of the bullocks is seen slipping mid-street and falling, causing the cart to veer towards the edge of the road," said Majumdar. "The person who shot the video said that the organisers quickly took the bullocks away."
 
  Majumdar said that she too had spotted a few bullocks on the main road that same morning, but assumed it was for some religious procession. "The bullocks were huge and healthy. It's only when I received this video that I realised they were actually for an illegal bullock cart race," she said. The Bombay HC has extended its ban on bullock cart races and termed the sport "cruel". The   recently reserved its order on such races. 
 
  Majumdar has submitted a complaint letter at Kashimira police station "The cops have accepted it, but they were busy with New Year's Eve security arrangements and said they would lodge an offence on Monday," she added. 
 
 While an on-duty constable confirmed having received the letter, inspector Shingare of the police station denied it. "We have not received any such letter. Once we get it, appropriate action will be taken," he said.
