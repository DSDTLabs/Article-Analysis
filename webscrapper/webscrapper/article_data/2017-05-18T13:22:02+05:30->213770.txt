HYDERABAD: As many as 10 MMTS trains were either cancelled or partially cancelled on Wednesday leaving scores of passengers inconvenienced. Officials attributed the sudden disruption to a signal failure in the morning. This also led to long delays of one to three hours. 

 Among the MMTS trains that were cancelled were Train No 47132 and 47133 (Lingampally - Hyderabad) and Train No 47108 and 47109 (Hyderabad - Lingampally). Five trains between Lingampally and   were partially cancelled. Train No 47197 (Falaknuma - Hyderabad) was terminated at the Secunderabad station. The technical snag, officials said, was reported at around 8am. This slowed down the movement of MMTS trains tremendously as manual signalling mode had to be resorted to. "While signalling failure can happen due to technical issues in remote monitoring of the route, it is a key component that also ensures safety and speed. It plays a key role in train crossovers - where a train moving on one route shifts to another route seamlessly -- without having to manually change the line and clamp it down," an official said. 
 
 While the problem was fixed about two-and-half hours later, the ripple effect of the snag was felt till late afternoon with passengers complaining of having a harrowing time making their way to destinations. Among them was   who was stuck at the   station for close to two hours. He said, "While intermittent delays in the MMTS schedule are common, on Wednesday it was insufferable. I got very late to work and had to hear an earful from my boss." Another passenger   took to social media to vent. Tagging the Union railway minister in his tweet, he wrote: "Sir due to delay in  , we are not sure whether we can catch train: 17026 at Secunderabad. Can u please help sir."
