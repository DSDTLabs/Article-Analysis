GHAZIABAD: A day after the Samajwadi Party declared its candidates for all the seats in NCR, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) announced its candidates for two seats in   and three seats in Ghaziabad. The announcement has dimmed the prospects of   tying up with the SP or the   in a pre-poll alliance.

 On Friday, the party had released a list with the names of its candidates for Modinagar and Loni constituencies in Ghaziabad. The names of its candidates for Dadri and Jewar seats in Gautam Budh Nagar and the Muradnagar seat in Ghaziabad were declared in another list on Saturday.
 
 In the 2012 polls, RLD’s Modinagar candidate Sudesh Sharma had defeated his nearest rival,   of BSP, by a margin of 13,949 votes. 
 
 Sharma has been repeated by RLD as its candidate for Modinagar in the list declared on Friday. The list also named Madan Bhaiya as the party’s candidate for Loni. Bhaiya, a Loni strongman, had lost the seat to BSP’s Zakir Ali in 2012 by a margin of 25,248 votes.
 
 In the list of 35 candidates released on Saturday, the party has fielded Ajaypal Pramukh from Muradnagar. For Dadri and Jewar, the party has announced the names of Ravinder Bhati and Kamal Sharma respectively.
 
 “We will field candidates in all 403 seats of UP. The top leaders of our party are in talks with the NCP and the JD(U), seeking their help in the assembly polls,” RLD national general secretary Trilok Tyagi told TOI.
 
 The RLD is supposed to have a strong vote base in the rural areas of Ghaziabad, particularly Modinagar and Muradnagar, where political fortunes are dependent on various issues concerning sugarcane farmers. The party also has a significant vote base in Jewar.
