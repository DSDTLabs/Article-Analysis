Margao: Mining dependents, at a meeting held at Sanvordem on Wednesday, strongly condemned the recent retrenchment of employees by the   Group, even as they demanded that the government confiscate the ore “illegally” extracted by mining companies after the February 7 order of the Supreme Court cancelling 88 mining leases.

 The meeting was held under the banner of Goa Mining People’s Front (GMPF) and was a part of a campaign to demand the immediate resumption of mining in the state.
 
 President of GMPF, Puti Gaonkar, pointing out to the high court order of May 4, urged the government to confiscate all such ore extracted by mining firms between February 7 and March 15 as it was “illegal”. The proceeds from the sale of this ore should be distributed among mining dependents, he said.
 
 Speakers also demanded that the mining leases be renewed only on the condition that all the retrenched workers are reinstated in their employment.
 
 Sarpanch of the Sanvordem village panchayat Sandip Pauskar, president of the All Goa Mining Machinery Owners Association, Sachin Parab, president of the Sesa Goa Truck Owners Association, Vallabh Dalvi, and secretary of the South Goa Truck Owners Association, Satyawan Gaonkar, were among those who addressed the gathering.
