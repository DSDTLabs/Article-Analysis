 The two countries last held talks over the two projects in March this year during the meeting of the   (PIC) in Pakistan.
 
 Pakistan had approached the World Bank last year, raising concerns over the designs of two hydroelectricity projects located in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
 It had demanded that the World Bank, which is the mediator between the two countries under the 57-year-old water distribution pact, set up a court of arbitration to look into its concerns.
 
 On the other hand, India had asked for the appointment of a neutral expert to look into the issues, contending the concerns Pakistan raised were "technical" ones.
 
 Following this, the international lender had in November 2016 initiated two simultaneous processes â€” for appointing neutral expert and establishment of court of arbitration to look into technical differences between the two countries in connection with the projects.
 
 The simultaneous processes, however, were halted after India objected to it.
 
 After that, representatives of the World Bank held talks with India and Pakistan to find a way out separately.
