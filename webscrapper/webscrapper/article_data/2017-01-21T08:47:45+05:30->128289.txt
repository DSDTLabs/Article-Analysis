LUCKNOW:   screening is set to be included in the   for  . The state health and   is working on a proposal to make it a part of the  .

 Women in initial stages of pregnancy can also go in for a pre-natal test (done around the 11th week) to find if foetus is a carrier or a sufferer of the thalassemia. In case the child turns out to be a sufferer, the fetus may be aborted. 
 
 Director, National Health Mission, Alok Kumar said, “Expert groups have pointed out that thalassemia is the most common and incurable inherited single gene disorder. But it can be prevented by genetic screening and counselling. For this, state medical colleges have been given funds to procure specialised medical equipment as well.” 
 
 Citing medical literature, Dr Amresh Singh of NHM, said, “The equipment will also be used to help couples get their thalassemia test done before planning their baby.” 
 
 Figures show that six out of 100 Indians are carriers of the mutated thalassemia gene. If a child inherits one thalassemia gene, he is referred as a carrier - many of whom can lead a completely normal and healthy life. But, if the child inherits two thalassemia genes - one from each parent - he will develop the disease. 
 
 However, there are just 25% chances of receiving the trait genes and developing the disease, 50% chances of the child being a thalassemia carrier and 25% chance for him being a normal child.
 
 thalassemia causes mild or severe anemia (a condition of reduced haemoglobin and fewer red blood cells in human body) and bone marrow transplant is the curative treatment. However finding the matching bone marrow is difficult. Besides the process costs about Rs 10-15 lakh.
