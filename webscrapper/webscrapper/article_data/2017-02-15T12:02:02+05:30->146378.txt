VADODARA: Buoyed by the success of its first sculpture camp to make artworks from scrap, the   (VMC) is looking to hold a camp on a much larger scale next month. This time around, the civic body will be reaching out to artists and rope them in after a selection process by a committee.

 The VMC had recently held a sculpture camp involving 25 artists from the city. A majority of works by these artists are ready and four of them have also been installed on prominent crossroads in the city.
 
 The civic body will be installing as many sculptures as possible at crossroads and prominent places in the city from the last camp that was held in January. The remaining will be put up at a sculpture park that is being planned at the Harni pond.
 
 VMC commissioner Dr   said that the work for the sculpture camp will be put up before the standing committee and will be taken up after a nod. “We are looking at getting around 100 sculptures made from artists. The camp will be announced through newspaper advertisements and we will invite artists to participate in it,” said Rao.
 
 The VMC is looking to have a team of mentors headed by former dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts of the M  , professor  . The team will decide on the criteria for the selection of the artists and will scrutinise the application it gets. The artists selected by the mentors will then work to make sculptures from scrap on a pre-decided theme.
 
 Given the scale of the work that the civic body is looking at, it will be approaching other institutes and organisations in the city for scrap. It has already approached the   and the Vadodara Division of the Indian Railways. It is also looking to approach the public sector units in the city and other industries.
