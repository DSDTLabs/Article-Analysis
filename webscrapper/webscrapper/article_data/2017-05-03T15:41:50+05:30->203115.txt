It emerged late last month that '  2' that had reportedly been stuck at the editing table since 2013, was revived with the film's writer-director-leading man  's production house buying it from the original producer, Aascar Ravichandran. Haasan made it clear that he now owns the movie, tweeting, "Happy to announce, Raajkamal Films International has taken over the responsibility of bringing 'Vishwaroopam 2' within this calendar year 2017..."On Tuesday, the veteran released the first posters of 'Vishwaroopam 2' in Hindi, English, Tamil and Telugu. When asked why it took four years for the film to unveil, he told Mirror, "My producer was multitasking with many films but I have now taken over the responsibility of taking my product to the audience. All the actors are returning, even those who died in the first part. The surprise new addition is   ji."

  
  
 
 The 62-year-old   added that like the 2013 original the sequel too takes on terrorism responsibly with dialogue mitigating animosity, not guns. "Not only the film but all of us will, again and again, take on terrorism," he asserted. While the original was set in the US, the sequel will be shot in India as well as several international locations.
 
 'Vishwaroopam', the 2013 spy-thriller was fronted by Haasan while  , Shekhar Kapur, Pooja Kumar, Andrea Jeremiah and Jaideep Ahlawat appeared in supporting roles. The film was produced simultaneously as a bilingual in Tamil and Hindi and dubbed in Telugu, with a soundtrack by Shankar-EhsaanLoy, lyrics by Vairamuthu and Haasan himself which   translated in Hindi.
