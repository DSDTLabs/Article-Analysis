THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the Union government dilly-dallies in taking any decision on the request by the   community in the country to extend an invite for   so that he can visit India, the Kerala government has sent out a hearty invite to the Pope, urging him to visit the state, where there is a large chunk of Christian believers, at an earliest convenient date. As per 2011 census, 18.38% of the Kerala’s 3.34 crore population are Christians.

 The invite from chief minister   was handed over to Pope Francis by tourism minister   on Thursday. Surendran, who visited the Pope in  , had a brief personal meeting with him. He went to Italy after attending International Tourism Fair in Berlin.
 
 “It was a hearty visit. Pope Francis accepted our invitation and expressed his desire to learn more about Kerala,” said Surendran. The visiting minister handed over a pack of assorted varieties of spices from Kerala and the wooden sculptor of a caparisoned elephant to the Pope as the state’s gift. “Progressive stance taken by Pope Francis in many issues has always attracted me,” Surendran said.
 
 When Pope Francis planned a tour of Myanmar and Bangladesh in November last year, the Catholic community in India hoped that India would also be part of the itinerary. There were efforts from many quarters, including from the Catholic Bishops’ Confederation of India (CBCI), to ensure an invite from the Centre to the Pope. But the BJP-led Union government didn’t take any decision on the requests.
 
 Sources in the state government said the LDF government viewed this an opportunity not only to win the support of minority Christian community but also as a chance to embarrass the BJP. If the Pope accepts Kerala’s invitation, the Union government will naturally be compelled to provide all diplomatic courtesies for the head of state to his visit.
 
 In 1986, Pope John Paul II had visited Kerala as part of his India tour that lasted for 10 days and covered 14 cities.
