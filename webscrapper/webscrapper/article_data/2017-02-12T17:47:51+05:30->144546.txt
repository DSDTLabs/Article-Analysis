CHENNAI: Before heading to Koovathur to meet MLAs staying in a resort there,   general secretary VK   on Sunday reiterated that it will be her party, under her leadership, that will run   for the next four-and-a-half years.

 Sasikala said it is not uncommon for women politicians to get targeted. "Even Amma (late chief minister J Jayalalithaa) faced many challenges while running the party. And these last 33 years I have faced these challenges with her. This is not new to me," said Sasikala.
 
 Asked about a letter that has been doing the rounds on social media which states that the party leader might commit suicide if her demands were not met with, she said it was a “fake letter.” "The letter threatening suicide is a lie. I am not scared of threats."
 
  
  
 
 
 On the 
  , Sasikala said, "Such situations have arisen even with Puratchi Thalaivar MG Ramachandran, when there were dissenters in the party. Such attempts to split the party will have no effect on our party unity." 
 
 Currently, half a dozen of MLAs in Chennai continue to remain in the city and not at Koovathur, said sources. 
 
 VK Sasikala on Sunday left for Golden Bay Resort with a modest entourage of just five vehicles. Her convoy had over 30 vehicles when she went to Koovathur on Saturday.
 
 "We have been asked to join
  later in the evening," said an AIADMK member at  , whose cars were one among many vehicles that were kept idling and ready to go. 
 
 Only around 150 people were seen gathered outside Poes Garden and the mood was fairly somber. Only a few members had painted their bodies or wore colourful hats.
 
 This compares to the over 500 supporters and general public present outside  's residence on the Greenways Road. A festive mood prevailed outside his residence.
