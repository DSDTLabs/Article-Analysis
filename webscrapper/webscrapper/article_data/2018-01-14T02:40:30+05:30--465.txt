 MUMBAI: Several truckloads of debris have been dumped over the last few weeks inside the CRZ and wetland area adjoining to   in sector 8 and 9 of   node, behind the gas depot and D Mart. The storm water nullah which opens out in the creek here is being choked by debris mafia in order to reclaim the area for a new slum pocket and illegal construction, said locals. 

 Residents have expressed fear that this may lead to flooding during monsoon and destruction of wetland. But the authorities are busy passing the buck. The dumping site is very close to mangrove stretch and may be extended further to destroy the green cover. 
 
 A forest official said that the dumping is away from the protected forest area and it is the task of Cidco and   to monitor it. The growing differences among various agencies have encouraged the encroachers who capitalized the advantage. “The dumping has to be stopped now. Else, it will be a daunting task to control encroachment,” said activist  . 
 
 Local residents say that all the agencies like NMMC, Cidco and forest wing are responsible for this mess. “Action must be initiated against encroachers immediately. We have bought homes in the towers considering the scenic beauty of the creek site. We are concerned that slum pockets will come up soon if the dumping activity continues,” said a resident Amulya Senapati. 
 
 Even heavy machinery was being used to carry out leveling the debris. PB Rajput, controller of unauthorized construction, Cidco, Navi Mumbai North, said “We have to check the ownership of the site to ensure that further action can be initiated.”
