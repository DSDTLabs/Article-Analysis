LUCKNOW: The BJP has invaded the Gandhi bastions and planted the lotus, quite firmly, in the hands of Amethi and Rae Bareli folk. Saturday's sweeping mandate for BJP resulted in the complete decimation of Congress in Rahul Gandhi's constituency Amethi. From a naught in 2012, the BJP has made a giant leap, winning six out of 10 seats in the twin Gandhi pocket borough.

 While the Amethi seat was wrested out of SP minister  's stronghold and handed over to BJP's 'Rani' Garima Sinh, the party has also lost the two seats it has won here in 2012 -Jagdishpur and Tiloi. This time, though, while four of the five assembly constituencies were lapped up by the BJP, SP's incumbent MLA Rakesh Pratap Singh will get another term in the UP assembly as a SP nominee. The Congress did only marginally better in Rae Bareli, the neighbouring constituency that Congress president   has held since 1998.
 
 Here, the party debuted on the Rae Bareli Sadar and Harchandpur seats, and conceded Unchahar to alliance partner SP, and the remaining two, Sareni and Bachhrawan, to the BJP.
 
 Alliance leaders attribute the performance to the internal troubles over seat-sharing. Congress leaders -read Priyanka Gandhi Vadra -was keen to see the Congress contest on all 10 seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli.
 
 Even though this appeared a bad electoral decision -considering Congress had only won two of 10 in 2012 -Congress pressed for total control over all seats in twin VIP zones. Eventually, the SP conceded ground on seven seats, four of which ended up seeing a contest between the SP and Congress, in addition to the common enemy, BJP.
