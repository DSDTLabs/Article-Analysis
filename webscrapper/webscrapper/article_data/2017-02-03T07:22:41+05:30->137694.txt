BENGALURU: The Karnataka   (Protection & Regulation during Emergency Situations) Bill, 2016, aims to facilitate the fundamental right of access to emergency care and treatment for injured persons, which is a key aspect of the right to life. In the absence of an efficient   system in India, bystanders can play a crucial role in providing assistance to victims within the first one hour. In order to ensure that timely assistance is provided to road accident victims, the Bill provides protection to Good Samaritans from civil and criminal liabilities by establishing a supportive legal environment.

 The Bill elaborates on the rights of Good Samaritans and obligations related to hospitals, law enforcement and court proceedings.
