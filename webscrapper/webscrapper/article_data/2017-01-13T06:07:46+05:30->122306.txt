MUMBAI:  , second of the six Scorpene-class submarines being built in India for the navy, was launched at the   (MDL) on Thursday , paving the way for her sea trials. The first one, INS Kalvari, is already undergoing trials and is expected to be inducted into the force around May.

 During the launch, minister of state for defence   said the leak of data on secret capabilities of the Scorpene class submarines last year would not have any big impact on the  's security preparedness.
 
 “The leak will not create any security issue... Several additions and alterations have been done [design and technology-wise during building of the submarines in the last five years] and the final outcome will be totally different. An inquiry has been conducted and necessary steps have been initiated,“   said adding that INS Khanderi is expected to be delivered to the Indian Navy in a year after completing the sea trials.
 
 By 2020, the last of the six Scorpene submarines will be inducted into the Navy , the minister added.
