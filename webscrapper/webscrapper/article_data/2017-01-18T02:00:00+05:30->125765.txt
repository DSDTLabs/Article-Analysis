PATNA: In a first in Bihar capital, an eight-day ‘Panchkalyanak Pranpratishtha Mahotsava’ opened amid singing of bhajans at the Shakha Maidan on Rajendra Nagar road number 5 on Tuesday.

 The Jain religious event started with a large procession of hundreds of kesariya-clad women carrying kalash on their heads. The procession originated from the newly constructed Parshwanath Digambar Jain Mandir near Congress Maidan. 
 
 Called ‘Ghat Yatra’ and led by Jain saint Acharya Sheetalsagar, the procession reached the Shakha Maidan where the grand fest will be held for the next eight days to conclude with a mahaygya for world peace on January 24.
 
 Along with the procession an idol of Lord Mahavira was also carried in a palanquin to the Shakha Maidan where huge pandals have been put up over an area of over 16000sqft.
 
 Mahotsav convenor Ajit Jain said Acharya Sheetalsagar would conduct the pranpratishtha rituals. Several other Jain saints will also participate in the rituals.
 
 A large number of Jain devotees and pilgrims from across the country have started arriving in Patna to participate in the Mahotsava. The organisers have booked over 200 rooms in city hotels and guesthouses for their stay. A team of 100-odd people from Kolkata is engaged in cooking food for the devotees participating in the Mahotsava.
