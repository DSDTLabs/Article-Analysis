Vijayawada: AP government has introduced several innovative initiatives in the revenue department in the last four years, most of which are unique and first-of-its-kind in the country,   chief minister K E Krishna Murthy, who is also the minister for revenue, said on Saturday.

 Speaking to reporters, Krishna Murthy said AP is the first state in the country to integrate land records with banks for creating charge on land online. The state was also the first in the country to complete Aadhaar linking of pattadars in land records, it was the first to implement enumeration of crop details through e-Pantam, and geo-tagging of each land parcel, and one of the few states to give access to people to view and print land records information under the Digital India land records modernisation programme. 
 
 The ‘Mee Bhoomi” portal was launched in 2015, providing revenue records like Adangal, village maps, field measurement books (FMB) for people to view and download. The portal has been viewed by more than 3 crore people since then, the minister said, adding that the government is making available 42.5 lakh FMBs online out of the total 48.6 lakh.
 
 All government land in the state have been computerised and the data shared with various departments, the minister added. The information technology initiatives of the department have reduced people’s direct contact with the departments for various land-related requirements. Online registration system has been introduced and lands in 12 districts, excluding Srikakulam, can be registered anywhere in the state.
 
 Services like issuing certificates to people by the tehsildars has been made online and simple with people getting the services from mee-seva and e-seva centers, the minister added. In addition to this, the government has also decided to create new revenue mandals, particularly in urban areas like Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Tirupati to take the revenue departments closer to the people.
