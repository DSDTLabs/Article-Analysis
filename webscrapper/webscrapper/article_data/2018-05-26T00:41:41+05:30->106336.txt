MUMBAI: The   in Bandra (E) on Thursday rescued two   that were allegedly being misused in a rally organized by the   party to protest against the increasing fuel prices. 

 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India assisted the police to file an FIR against the horses’ custodians under sections 3 and 11 of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, for mistreating the animals.
 
 PETA activists said at the political rally, people took turns to sit on the horses and click pictures. They claimed the custodians constantly kicked the horses and forced them to walk under the scorching sun for hours without food, water and shade. Both rescued horses were later transported to the civic cattle pound in Malad for veterinary care. “Keeping horses in Mumbai is illegal, and using them in rallies and protests is also not allowed,” said Meet Ashar, PETA India emergency response coordinator.
