HYDERABAD: It's a rare feat and it's happened only twice in the history of Test cricket. If   did it first,   was the second on Feb 7, 1999. Memories came flooding back of that splendid moment when the Indian head coach reminisced about his `perfect 10' ­ 1074 ­ during his media interaction ahead of the one-off Test match against Bangladesh.

 “I don't think I ever thought 18 years ago when I sat in the dressing room, going out to bowl, that I will pick up 10 wickets. It is one of those things that happen. It is nice to celebrate anniversaries of cricketing milestones as well.If it happens, it happens. It can happen tomorrow or 10 years down the line or may not happen at all. I don't think anybody gave me a chance to pick up 10 wickets,“ he said on Tuesday when asked of his achievement.
 
 The 46-year-old leggie, who played 132 Tests and is the highest wicket-taker for India with 619 scalps, said: “It is a very rare occurrence and I was privileged and blessed to be a part of that. It is something very unique. I am glad people remember anniversaries and we also celebrate cricketing anniversaries. It is very rare,“ he added. VVS Laxman, with whom Kumble shared the dressing room for many years, was elated when reminded of the feat.“It was a phenomenal achievement. To be part of the memorable occasion will be special for me because I was his roommate and I also happened to take the last catch that got rid of Akram,“ Laxman told TOI.
