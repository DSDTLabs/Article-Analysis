But after clearing the preliminary and main examinations, he was sent to the UPSC medical board, which examined him and determined that he has only 30% disability.
 
 He appealed before the appellate medical board (AMB), which examined him and concluded that his disability was 40% and declared him eligible for selection under the visually-impaired quota. 
 
 But following a last-minute complaint by a third party alleging that the candidate fudged the disability percentage to secure admission, the UPSC chairman referred the matter to an expert committee under the  . 
 
 The expert committee did not clinically examine Rizwan, but reviewed the papers and declared his visual impairment was only 30%.
 
 Agreeing with Rizwan's counsel Kandukuri Sudhakar Reddy, the CAT bench said the authorities had violated their own rules. Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Kantha Rao said the regulation relating to visual impairment clearly says no appeal against the AMB will be entertained and that its decision is final and binding.
