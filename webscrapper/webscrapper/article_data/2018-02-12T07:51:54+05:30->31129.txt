CHENNAI: Looks like   Public Service Commission ( ) does not know when Nobel-winning poet   was born. For a question it asked to group-IV candidates, it gave four options, all wrong.

 The four choices on Tagore’s birthday — May 18, 1861; May 17, 1861; May 17, 1816; and June 17, 1861 — were incorrect said candidates who wrote the test on Sunday. Tagore was born on May 7, 1861. The goof-up has put candidates in a spot of bother.
 
 TNPSC said candidates could get back to the commission in case of uncertainty over options provided and one-week time would be given after the answer key is released for feedback.
 
 Nearly 3.16 lakh (16%) of the total 20.69 lakh registered candidates absented themselves from the exam held at 6,962 centres across the state to fill village administrative offices (VAOs), typewriting assistants and other posts in various state   Thousands of engineering graduates appeared for the test for which the minimum required qualification is Class X.
 
 Following reports on irregularities in exams conducted by  , additional safety measures were taken to prevent malpractice. “Name, photo and other details of candidates were printed on the answer scripts for the first time to avoid candidate duplication,” said M Rajaram, former IAS official and TNPSC member. “No private firms were involved and only TNPSC officials were used to conduct the exam.”
 
 Meanwhile, actor-turned-politician Vijayakanth got trolled on Twitter for ‘misleading’ candidates. One among the questions was on the etymology of mannipu (apology). Though it is an Urdu word, many answered Tamil because of Vijayakanth’s famous line from Ramana, “Mannipu is one word which I don’t like in Tamil.” Twitterati trolled Captain for “letting them down with his dialogue”.
