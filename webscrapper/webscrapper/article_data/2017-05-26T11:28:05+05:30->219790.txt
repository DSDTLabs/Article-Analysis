HYDERABAD: While Uzma, the Indian woman who alleged she was forced to marry a   at gunpoint, has returned, the fate of another Indian woman who has been held captive by her husband seems unclear. 

 Mohammedi Begum, 45, from Hyderabad has been struggling to return to her country from Sialkot, where she has been held captive, for the last 10 years.
 
 Mohammedi Begum's parents - father   and mother Hazira Begum - are hopeful that Union minister   will help in bringing back their daughter. "My daughter has been suffering for 10 years in Pakistan. I plead with Sushma Swaraj to get her back," Hazira Begum said. 
 
 According to the mother, Mohammedi's husband beats her everyday. "She is physically abused and kicked. Her husband and other family members do not even take her to the hospital. My daughter is being treated like a slave," Hazira Begum said.
 
 On Thursday evening, Mohammedi made a phone call to her parents once again and narrated her plight. 
 
 Residents of New Mohammednagar, Bandlaguda, and the family were excited that Mohammedi had got a good proposal for marriage in 1996. They were shown the photograph of Mohammed Younis of Oman and they agreed for the marriage. "The nikah was performed on the phone. In less than a month's time, my daughter went to Oman," Hazira Begum said.
 
  However, little did the family or even Mohammedi know that she had gotten married to a   until she was forced to go to the country by Younis. While in Muscat, Oman, she gave birth to four children and another son in Pakistan.
 
 Mohammedi Begum's plight was taken to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj by MBT leader Amjedullah Khan sometime back and she had also responded. The High Commission of India in Pakistan is also pursuing the issue. "We know the government is seriously pursuing Mohammedi's issue but my daughter is growing desparate by the day. The process should be speeded up," Mohd Akber said.
