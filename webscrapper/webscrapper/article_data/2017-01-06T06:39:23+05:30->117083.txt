AJMER: Naya Gav was selected for the cashless village campaign as it had fewer people and only five shops.

 The   (BoB) made all efforts over the last two months to make Naya Gav a cashless village. It provided training to villagers to use cards for cashless transactions and also ran a campaign to make them aware about online transactions. But they found that illiteracy and the ‘adamant’ nature of villagers were slowing down the pace of digitalisation.
 
 BoB’s Harmara branch manager Devi Lal Dhaka said that they first ensured that everyone in the village had a bank account and gave them ATM cards. Officials also helped villagers to download the mobile banking app and trained them to use it.
 
 Dhaka said that a team from Jaipur provided training to villagers. He added that as the net connectivity of PoS machines was being done from Jaipur, which has delayed the process of getting these machines operational. “Four of the five machines will be activated in a day or two. The fifth one is pending as the shop owner has not provided his PAN number,” he said.
 
 He said that in next coming months they would install an ATM at Naya Gav. They were also planning to install micro ATMs where villagers make transactions using their thumb impression.
 
 On December 17, students of the Naya Gav school had demonstrated the online banking process by buying pen and pencils. “I accept that there has been some net connectivity problem in the village and I have requested the administration to arrange the facility,” said the bank manager.
