CHANDIGARH: The   High Court on Tuesday set aside the counselling process for admissions to   medical courses in Haryana. The court also directed the state government to pay Rs 1 lakh each to the candidates who appeared in the first round. 

 The HC ruling was on a petition filed by   challenging the prospectus issued by Haryana for admissions in MD/MS/PG diplomas for 2017 session on the ground that institutional preference granted by the state and the incentives to in-service Haryana Civil Medical Service (HCMS) doctors in the prospectus are against the provisions of regulation 9 of the Post-Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2000 framed by the Medical Council of India (MCI).
 
 The petitioners contended the institutional preference to the students who have passed their MBBS or BDS from medical or dental colleges of Haryana does not conform to regulation 9 of the PG Regulations of MCI. It was further argued the 20 per cent incentive granted for rural service also violates the MCI Regulations.
 
 The counsel for MCI contended it is a body of experts and Regulation-9 is a complete code in itself for medical admission. He added the incentives of marks granted to in-service HCMS doctors is justifiable for their service in notified difficult and remote areas and not just in rural areas.
