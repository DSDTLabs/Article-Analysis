CHENNAI: Officials in the state consumer disputes redressal commission have written to the Tamil Nadu government to start one more district forum for Chennai south as the total number of pending cases is more than 2,000, a senior official said. This is leading to delay in people getting justice in consumer cases.

  Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has stated that there should be a separate district forum wherever there are 250 cases pending. “Chennai is struggling to dispose the cases, and urgently needs another forum,” the senior official said. Chennai now has two district commissions, for Chennai north and Chennai south. The official said that more people come forward to file consumer cases in Chennai south due to the higher literacy rate.
 
 Across the state, there are more than 8,960 cases pending in 30 district dispute redressal commissions till end of April, data sourced from   shows. Around 3,000 of them have been pending for more than two years. Meanwhile, there are 27 vacancies of presidents and members in the district fora across the state. SCDRC has a vacancy of two judicial members. SCDRC president   said selections have been made and the government would be making the appointments soon. 
 
 Before the SCDRC benches of Chennai and Madurai, 3,452 cases are pending. Of these, 1,444 are have been pending for two years.
 
 SCDRC president Justice S Tamilvanan said the 31st district forum was opened in Ariyalur on May 5 and the 32nd would come up in Tirupur. TN government has sanctioned Rs2.04 crore towards construction of buildings and sanctioned Rs2.15 crore for non-building assets based on recommendations of an empowered committee, he said.
