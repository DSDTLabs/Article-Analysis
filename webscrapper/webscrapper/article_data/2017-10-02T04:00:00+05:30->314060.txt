 Security strengthened at Suvali beach 
 
 Surat: Suvali is considered one of the most dangerous beaches in the country because of a number of deaths here in the past two decades.
 
 “We have strengthened security. We have also installed signage on the beach for the benefit of people. This is to caution people about certain things in view of the past history of the place. Safety of people remains our top priority,” said Munshi. 
 
 Olpad MLA Mukesh Patel told TOI, “I have got a dredging scheme at a cost of Rs7.5 crore approved for the spot where people get trapped when they ventured out into the sea at Suvali. The project would be launched soon to minimize any danger to people.”
