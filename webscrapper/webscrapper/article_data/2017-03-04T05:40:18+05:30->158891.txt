AMRITSAR: A Sikh organization,  , has floated project ‘Oxygen Langar’ as a step towards   amid deforestation and mindless burning of stubble in Punjab.

 While talking to TOI on Friday, president of US-based Sikh body Rajwant Singh said they had suggested all Sikh organizations and individuals to make distributing plant saplings a permanent feature along with traditional langar from March 14 which was celebrated as Sikh Environment Day to mark the Gur Gaddi (installation of Guruship) Diwas of Sikh’s seventh master Guru Har Rai.
 
 EcoSikh Project manager Ravneet Singh said that traditional langar often finishes in a few hours’ time but   is a lifetime proposition. A tree will live for decades releasing much-needed oxygen for all the living beings, he said. He said last year they had given a slogan of Organic Langar.
 
 Some of the suggestions for Oxygen Langar given by the Sikh body includes distributing plant saplings, planting trees around gurdwaras, organizing walk and outdoor activities, taking steps to save water and increase recycling, setting up kirtan and katha on nature and more.
 
 Stressing on government’s role in protecting the environment, Rajwant said EcoSikh would also suggest the new state government to help farmers switch to healthy farming techniques, water conservation and provide solutions for stubble burning which was a major cause of pollution and respiratory problems.
 
 The Sikh body’s agenda for celebrating Sikh’s first master Guru Nanak Dev’s 550th birth anniversary in 2019 includes planting 10 historically significant trees in the name of 10 Gurus in parikarma of the Golden Temple, creating forest at Guru Nanak’s birthplace Nankana Sahib, energy audits of major historical gurdwaras and more.
 
 Rajwant said they would also urge the new government in Punjab to observe Sikh Environment Day as a state-level function besides implementing state-level nature protection program.
