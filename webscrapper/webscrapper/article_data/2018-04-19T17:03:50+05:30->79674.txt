NAGPUR: Justin  , 27, a native of   in  , will go down in the history of   (IIM-N) not just a student who achieved a couple of firsts for the institute, but also as someone who had won many tough personal battles. Coming from a poor background, Justin didn't have ideal conditions to make it big in life unlike many of his classmates. 

 Right from his schooling days, his family found it difficult to make ends meet. Justin remained focused on his goals and finally achieved them when Hyderabad-based Value Labs offered him associate director's job and a pay package of Rs 19 lakh. Both, the job profile and the pay, are highest so far to have been offered to any IIM-N student.
 
  An elated Justin told TOI that his family was traditionally in tailoring business before becoming a victim of industrialisation. "My grandfather was a tailor and naturally my father was drawn into the same business. But, readymade garments spelt doom for our family and several like us. There wasn't enough work and my father started finding it difficult to earn enough for our basic needs," he said. 
 
 The family would depend on government subsidies to fulfil their needs. "Ration through PDS was our main source of food," he said, adding that his family could manage a meagre Rs 50,000 a year income. However, Justin's aunts knew only education could improve the family's fortunes and ensured her nephew and his sister did not drop out of school. "My aunt took care of our studies till Class 12," he said. 
 
  Once Justin qualified for BTech from   at Trivandrum, scholarships helped him cover his expenses. 
 
 Before joining IIM-N, he worked with a software company for over two years . He wanted to pursue MBA from IIM-Kozhikode but couldn't make it in his first attempt. "I was getting older, so finally enrolled for Nagpur after the second attempt," he said.
