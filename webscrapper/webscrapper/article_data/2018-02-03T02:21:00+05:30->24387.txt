Vijayawada: War of words between mayor Koneru Sridhar and YSRC corporators led to suspension of three opposition members during the   session on Friday.

  The verbal duel started after mayor Sridhar raised some objections when YSRC floor leader B Punyaseela was speaking on the budget.
 
 Punyaseela expressed doubts on various heads, pointing out the difference in numbers in the present and previous budget copies. Her speech was first interrupted by co-opted member Siddam Nagendra Reddy. 
 
 He said there was no need to point out each and every head as the numbers given in the books were only estimated figures, which led to a small argument between the two.
 
 At that point, the mayor, pointing at Punyaseela, commented that “she does not know a thing and would not understand even after giving explanation”. YSRC member Bulla Vijay Kumar strongly objected to the mayor’s comment, and said they were asking for explanation which they are entitled to. He said the mayor should not speak in insulting language, especially with a woman corporator and also their floor leader.
 
 Supporting him, another YSRC member Jamala Poornamma started shouting from her seat. The mayor shouted back at Poornamma saying, “this is not a fair (santha) to shout” and told her keep quiet. Vijay Kumar again objected to the words used by the mayor and threw the budget copies in anger, following which the Telugu Desam members stood up raised slogans against his act.
 
 Members of both parties created a ruckus by walking into the mayor’s well. TD members demanded the suspension of Vijay Kumar for throwing budget papers. As members from both parties refused to calm down, the mayor ordered the suspension of Vijay Kumar and Poornamma and asked the marshals to take them out of the council hall. Chandana Suresh, who sat in protest before the mayor’s chair, was also suspended for the day.
