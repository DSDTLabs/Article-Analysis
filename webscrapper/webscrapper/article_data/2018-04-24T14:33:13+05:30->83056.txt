PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has demanded the scrapping of all existing planning and development authorities (PDAs).

 Stating that these are allowing abuse of power, AAP member Dean D’Cruz said outline development plans, too, must be denotified and the regional plan kept in abeyance till the TCP Act is amended to incorporate the 73rd and 74th amendment.
 
 The party said a ridiculous situation exists today where any MLA can sit as the chairperson on the board and dictate land use changes for favourites in complete conflict of interest.
 
 “A situation where the city of Panaji has its plans drawn up without taking into consideration the corporation, itself, is unheard of, and such boldness has spawned many politicians to jump into the fray, setting up arbitrary zones of planning in villages like  ,” AAP general secretary   said.
 
 “The Regional Plan 2021 was supposed to go back to the village for ratification,” D’Cruz said, demanding that the Regional Plan 2021 be sent to villages for ratification with clear guidelines using people’s participation through ward planning and gram sabhas to finalise this.
 
 AAP member   said the suggestions and corrections submitted to the TCP regarding the draft Regional Plan 2021 haven’t been taken into consideration.
