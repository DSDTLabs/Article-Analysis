GURUGRAM: Parents, shaken by the murder of Pradhyumn Thakur at   International School in Bhondsi last week, are knocking on every possible door, seeking help from different departments, to ensure safety of their children on  .

 Around 50 parents from sectors 55, 56 and 57 went to Sector 56 police station on Tuesday and demanded safety audit of all schools in the area. In their memorandum to SHO Arvind Kumar, the parents requested police to issue elaborate security guidelines for schools and ensure their strict implementation.
 
 “What happened with Pradhyumn could have happened with any other child. We want an assurance from the authorities that our kids are safe in their schools,” said Manish Jha, who shifted his children from Ryan International School to Narayan E Techno last year due to safety concerns.
 
 Parents have also approached ward councilors in their respective areas to mount pressure on schools to adhere to safety guidelines. “It is the responsibility of government agencies to ensure that schools follow the basic safety norms,” said Sushant Bhalla, whose kids study in Shalom Hills International.
 
 A group of parents also met district education officials, demanding regular inspection of schools and strict action against those flouting the norms. 
 
 “Many schools do not have proper security on their campus, which can later prove fatal,” said Ramphal Sheoran, who has a son and daughter studying in Shalom Hills International.
 
 “We will start audits from Wednesday, inspecting at least four schools a day. If any violation is detected, the schools will be given 15 days to make amends. If they still don’t comply, we can derecognise the school or take it over,”  ,  .
