BENGALURU:   national president   is set to visit coastal Karnataka next week and top of his agenda, it appears, with assembly elections looming, is to increase the polarization of votes in the Malnad and coastal regions of the state. A four-day padayatra by five firebrand MPs from the region lends credence to the intent of the saffron party’s strategy.

 The padayatra will commence from various locations across the region and culminate at a BJP rally in Suratkal, Mangaluru on Februray 19. Party sources say the five MPs include Mysuru’s Prathap Simha, Udupi-Chikkamagalur’s Shobha Karandlaje, Uttara Kannada MP and Union minister   and Dakshina Kannada’s Nalin Kumar Kateel.
 
 Sources say that while Simha will launch his padayatra from Mysuru, Karandlaje will begin hers from Udupi and Hegde from Ankola. Kateel will be join Simha later at Sullia as they head to Suratkal.
 
 At Suratkal, the five MPs, together with Shah, will hold a rally in the region. The MPs and Shah are scheduled to visit the home of Deepak Rao, one of the alleged 21 Hindu activists whom the BJP claim were murdered in the coastal region, as a symbolic gesture.
 
 “The main intent of the rally is to create awareness among the people about the killings of Hindu activists in the coastal and Malnad region,” said a BJP functionary. “We expect massive participation in the padayatra and also at the rally. The message will be delivered at the rally.”
