Ahmedabad: Poor roadworks in Ahmedabad ahead of the 2017 assembly elections turned out to be huge embarrassment, when the neta-contractor nexus stood exposed. 

 With 2019 Lok Sabha elections not far away and the Gujarat high court strictly monitoring road construction activities, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is in no mood to take chances. The AMC standing committee on Monday included a resolution to invite Expression of Interest (EOI) from nine consultants to monitor road construction and road resurfacing activities. 
 
 The final decision on the EOIs will be taken on Thursday's committee meeting. Each of the six administrative zones of the AMC will have a project management consultant who will be responsible for monitoring the progress of roadworks, execution of jobworks, quality checks , taking road measurements and even cross verification of the works. 
 
 The AMC, however, has not clarified whether the PMC progress reports will be placed in public domain for bringing in transparency in road construction projects. “There has not been any such direction from the standing committee earlier and neither do we think that there will be such a direction of putting the reports in public domain,” admitted a senior AMC   work engineer.
