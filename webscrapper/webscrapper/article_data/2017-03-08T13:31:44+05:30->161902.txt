CHANDIGARH: Alleging major scam into the re-routing of Metro lines in  , the   and government’s failure to control law and order situation in the state,   held a protest in Chandigarh on Tuesday. Led by party’s state unit president Ashok Tanwar, they tried to gherao the state assembly over an alleged land scam under the BJP government in the state but were detained by police.

 Around 40 party workers sustained injuries after the Chandigarh police used cane charge to disperse the protesters, the party claimed. Several Congress workers including Tanwar were detained and taken to the Sector 17 police station, officials said.
 
 Heavy   were made by the police to stop the Congress workers from going towards the Haryana assembly, officials said. Water cannons were deployed and the routes were barricaded by the police. As the protesters refused to pay heed to warnings, police used cane charge.
 
 “Gwal Pahari controversy is a major example of how government and the chief minister’s office (CMO) facilitated the builders by transferring the land and later cancelling the mutation. The case of re-routing the Metro line in Gurugram is similar. We (Congress) are not the only ones, even BJP leaders and MLAs have been raising the issue,” said Tanwar. 
 
 Haryana Congress general secretary Pradeep Singh Zaildar claimed three party workers sustained fractures in the police action. He said the Congress was protesting against the alleged transfer of 454 acres of municipal land in Gwal Pahari in Gurgaon to private parties at the behest of the BJP leadership. He also alleged that the route of the Metro line in Gurgaon was changed to favour certain BJP leaders, and builders close to them.
