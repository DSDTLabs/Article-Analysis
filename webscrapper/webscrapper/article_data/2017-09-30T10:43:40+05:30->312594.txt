PANAJI: One of Goa’s oldest bread, surecho pao, leavened with toddy (sur), used to be an unmissable breakfast staple. But the advent of yeast, a faster fermenting agent, and the declining availability of toddy, slowly saw the the exit of this variety from the bread basket about four decades ago. 

 This year’s Poderanchem Fest, which will be celebrated at Socorro, seeks to showcase this forgotten Goan legacy, especially for a generation that has missed out on the opportunity of relishing its unique flavour. Organized by Socorro Socio, Art and Cultural Association, the   and Zhaddancho Utsav, which will be held from September 30 to October 2, will showcase various activities between 9am and 9pm. 
 
 “Bakers stopped making surecho pao as toddy was either not easily available or was an expensive ingredient,” says   of Socorro. A block of yeast took just over three hours to get the dough ready for baking, while the toddy took more than four hours. 
 
 Fr Santan Carvalho, parish priest, Our Lady of Socorro church, says, “Surecho pao tasted delicious with kalchi koddi (yesterday’s curry) or attoileli koddi (thickened curry) or with a spread of butter or cheese.” 
 
 A young baker has been chosen for expertise transfer with Dias’s help. “We will make this bread and display it, as well as the recipe, at the festival,” he said.   believes that discerning consumers will pick the expensive bread. “Price will not be an issue for those who relish it,” he says. 
 
 “It is a challenge to bring surecho pao back,” said  , who is assisting in organizing the event.
 
 A free ghumot workshop for women and children has been planned. Former member secretary of Kala Academy, Pandurang Phaldesai and his team will be involved in the effort. 
 
 The food as usual “Goenchi boxi” will have the staple rice, koddi, pickles, bhaji and fish cooked by local villages.
