 Mujumdar was speaking on ‘Demystifying DeMo’ at AAVHAN 2017, organized by Dr Ambedkar Institute of Management Studies and Research (AIMSR), on its premises. He was the keynote speaker at the event. He said, “Look at demonetisation as a bigger canvas which began to be painted on November 8, and wait till its completion to watch its impact for the betterment of citizens of India.”
 
 Praising the initial success of demonetisation, he said, “The primary objective of demonetisation was of corruption-free India, stop generation of black money and counter feeding currency and control inflation which is successful.” Moreover, it is difficult to stop generation of black money as there are many ways to do so, he added.
 
 Talking about digital transitions in the country, Mujumdar said, “Before demonetisation, 60% of transactions were outside of banking system. Currently, 95% of transitions are through the banks which are flush with funds.” Bank loans which were written off and pending taxes were paid. This has boosted the banking system, he added.
