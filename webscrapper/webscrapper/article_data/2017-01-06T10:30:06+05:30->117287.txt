An   will make the contest truly triangular with BJP being the other major player apart from a host of smaller parties that will ally one way or the other. 

  has decided to field as many as 97 Muslim candidates of a total of 403, the highest number fielded by any political party in UP so far. The alliance will,   and SP leaders hope, reassure voters that the regional party's core Yadav-Muslim combination is intact. 
 
 At several public appearances recently, Akhilesh has said SP will benefit from an alliance, and that such a combine would deliver more than 300 seats. Congress leaders, though initially hesitant to comment on the possibility of an alliance, have also since admitted that "secular parties are under pressure" and "must come together to defeat a common, communal enemy: the BJP".
 
 Signalling that a formal announcement is round the corner, Congress CM face   has said she is willing to make way for Akhilesh if SP and Congress enter into an alliance. January 9 is also the date given to SP's warring factions to submit their affidavits of support to the Election Commission. Party insiders said it is likely that there will be more clarity on the family feud much before January 9.
 
 The SP-Congress alliance can be a winning combine in the UP polls because of its ability to cement the minority vote and to garner a section of upper caste votes that have traditionally sided with Congress. In UP, where a winning party needs 30% of the total votes polled to form a government, both Congress and SP - even with their poor show of 7.53% and 22.35%, respectively, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections - seem to be a "successful alliance" as long as there are no desertions and BJP's vote declines sharply.
