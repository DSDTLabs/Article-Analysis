AHMEDABAD: Six members of the   — a   — have been elected uncontested as board members on Friday.   confirmed that after   on Monday, some 12 forms were submitted for scrutiny out of which six forms were rejected. This left six members for six posts of board, thus electing them for the said posts uncontested. Four of these elected candidates were from the panel of the existing board, led by the club president, Yunus Sheikh. The club elections were scheduled on Sunday along with its annual general meeting, however it appears that no elections will take place now.

 Members from the opposite panel have alleged illegal contesting of elections. “There is no clarity on the reasons as to why our forms were rejected. We are waiting for a written reply from the management. There has to be transparency,” said a club member.
 
 Commenting on the issue, Sheikh said, “We have followed all the rules. We received an email on Friday last seeking appointment of a judicial officer to ensure free and fair elections. The appointment of a principal district judge was done on Tuesday. However, on Wednesday we once again received an email recommending names of a few people as the judicial officer.”
 
 “Since the officer was appointed, we did not appoint anyone else and he scrutinized the forms based on the copy of bylaws provided to him. Accordingly, six forms were rejected,” he added. Some 600 people are members of the Ahmedabad Gymkhana. Dissent appears to have been brewing against the current management for quite some time.
