Whatâ€™s most significant about Bengaluru is that it houses both cultural and historical landmarks and the high rises that add to its IT city tag with equal ease. It is no wonder that areas like Chamarajpet, which is home to many historical monuments and culturally significant landmarks, evoke as much interest among the city folk as the hotspots in the Central Business District do. Chamarajpet recently celebrated its 125th birthday with a procession that saw the participation of many folk artistes who displayed the rich dance forms of   like veeragase, dollu kunitha, yakshagana and hulivesha among others. The celebrations saw the participation of Bengaluru South MP   and the Mysuru Royal family members, which included  , along with the currently Mysuru king   and his wife Trishikha Kumari.
