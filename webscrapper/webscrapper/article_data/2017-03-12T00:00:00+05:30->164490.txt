When I mean a  , I don’t mean that you eat like one. I merely use this title as a way to classify — and to correct misconceptions of — diets that are high in liquid. What I call Water Buffalo Diets are those that make you wallow in water or other liquids, depriving you of essential nutrition. 

  You know how it starts. After a particularly unending weekend of   and binge  , you decide to turn over a new leaf or compensate for all the indulgences. You then decide to take the extreme step – liquid diet. It is actually quite bad for you. It doesn’t matter whether it’s juices, soups or water.
 
  I once had a client who came into my clinic after completing a liquid diet. It comprised lime water, reduced food intake and drinking more than four litres of water every day. Needless to say, the weight she lost came right back, and then some more. I’ll tell you what I told her: if you are on a liquid diet — no matter what that liquid may be — you will be almost completely starved of carbs, proteins and fats, all of which are crucial for your health. And, get this, crucial for long-lasting weight loss plans.
 
  Fat burning is a high metabolic activity and one needs nutrition to sustain it. Without that, the weight will come back as quickly as you lose it, and in many cases, you may gain more than you lost. 
 
  As all liquid diets are crash diets — side-effects include hair loss, brittle or weak nails as well as weaker bones, teeth or digestive tracts. Then comes, an irritable bowel. By drinking so much, you are essentially preventing your brain from sending out hunger signals. So even if you ‘feel fine’, your body will protest on its own way later. Other starvation side effects include dizziness, breathlessness, headaches, hallucinations, nausea, low blood pressure, palpitations and extreme fatigue.
 
  If you want to recover from an unhealthy phase or lifestyle, eat healthy to lose healthily.
