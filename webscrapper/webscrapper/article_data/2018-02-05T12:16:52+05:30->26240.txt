Dwayne Johnson's upcoming action film   has debuted its first action-packed trailer during the Super Bowl. The flick stars Johnson as former FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader and U.S. war veteran  , who now assesses security for skyscrapers. In China, he finds the tallest and safest building on the planet suddenly ablaze and he's being framed for the accident.

  
  
  In the teaser, Dwayne's character is missing a leg and relying on what looks like a high tech metal replacement. That fake metal leg is all that saves him from falling thousands of feet off the top of the skyscraper that seems to be the star of the movie. The opening scene depicts Dwayne walking on a connecting suspended bridge while escaping from a slew of bullets fired at him.
 
  Dwyane can be seen saving his family trapped in a building 244 floors above the ground in a skyscraper. Few minute into the teaser depicts the fake metallic leg of the protagonist with which he tries to take on the enemies which include being clinging with a rope and making a way into the glass building.
 
  This action film looks promising with its action-packed teaser. The background song 'I won't get down' is accompanied by a high-pitched music and intermittent sounds of machine guns filling up the background score.
 
  
  
 The entire trailer is shot in the nightlight as the fluorescent white bulbs fill up the landscape with constant bright lit blinding flashes filling up the screen. The teaser featuring   was launched on February. 4 .
 
  The film is slated for a July 13 release.
