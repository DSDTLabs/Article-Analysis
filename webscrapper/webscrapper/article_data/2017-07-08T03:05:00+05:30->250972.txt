THANE: A spat between a teenager and an auto driver on Friday turned ugly and both of them came to blows. The teenager, Pooja Gharat, later alleged that the auto driver did not want to drop her to the destination and assaulted her after an argument. However, eyewitness accounts do not corroborate the same. 

 Gharat, a resident of Shahad, Ulhasnagar, headed to Charai along with her friend, Aarti Duseja. “A man was already seated in a share auto when Aarti and I boarded. While Aarti wanted to go to Khopat, I had to reach Charai. The driver, Mahendra Pitale (49), was moving in another direction and told me to get off and take another auto. He was very rude,” said Gharat. 
 
 “We had an argument after which he slapped me. Later bystanders assaulted him,” added Gharat who works in a vehicle showroom.
 
 However, an eyewitness told the   that Gharat assaulted Pitale first. “When we spoke to the driver he said that Gharat slapped him first after which he attacked her. The account was corroborated by an eyewitness. She also snatched his badge after which the driver flew into a rage. We have registered a non-cognisable complaint against the two,” said deputy police commissioner D S Swami.
 
 Cops have appealed the public not to take the law into their hands.
