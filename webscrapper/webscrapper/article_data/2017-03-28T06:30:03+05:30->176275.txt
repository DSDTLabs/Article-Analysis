  “From the onset of summer, cities like Ahmedabad report more cases of vomiting, unconsciousness, abdominal pain, chest pain and falls. There has been a 30% rise above average in cases of vomiting and abdominal pain, which are attributed to the heat,” said an EMRI official. On Monday, EMRI recorded 35 cases of abdominal pain, 24 cases of unconsciousness, 20 cases of vomiting, 14 cases of falls and 11 of chest pain. Dr  , a city-based physician, said more and more offices and workplaces have air-conditioning. 
 
 “Thus, when someone goes from a low temperature to high and back, the body gets heat shock. These fluctuations can cause allergic cold, coughs and viral infections. Give your body time to acclimatize to the temperature. One should take plenty of liquid to stay hydrated. Two-wheeler riders should wear helmets to avoid direct heat to their head and cover the faces,” he said.
