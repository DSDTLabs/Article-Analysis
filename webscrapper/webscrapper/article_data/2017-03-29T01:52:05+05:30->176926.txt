For the first time in history, farmers in   are planning an indefinite strike to draw government’s attention towards their problems. 

 Groups of farmers in Aurangabad and Ahmednagar districts have started organizing meetings to galvanize support of farmers in other parts of the   for the strike which will start from June 1.
 
 Once the strike starts, farmers will produce only for their own consumption and not for market. Farmers plan to stop supply of food grains, cereals, fruits and milk in the market.
 
 “Gram sabhas will be conducted to pass resolution announcing strikes. The first gram sabha will be held on April 1 in Puntambe village in Ahmednagar. Other villages will follow into the footsteps. We will make it a state-wide agitation” said Dhananjay Dhorde, one of the farmer who has initiated this movement told TOI. 
 
 “We decided to launch this movement as the government is not sensitive towards farmers’ issues. Farmers are committing suicide years after years and nobody is bothered. No it is time that we prove our worth,” he added. 
 
 The cultivators are seeking a loan waiver, free electricity, appropriate price for produce, grant for irrigation, higher price for milk. 
 
 Farmers have faced two consecutive droughts and recent unseasonal showers have destroyed yield. The proposed strike might also snowball into a political controversy as the opposition has launched a stir against state government demanding loan waiver. The opposition has been stalling functioning of the House over the issue.
