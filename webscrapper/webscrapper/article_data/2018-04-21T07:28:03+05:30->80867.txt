PANAJI: Drishti Lifesaving Pvt Ltd which has been carrying out beach cleaning since December 2016, has conveyed to the government that it will be compelled to suspend its activity if pending bills are not cleared. A source said the company has written to the government that delays in receiving payments not only cause financial strain, but also restricts its ability to effectively and efficiently conduct beach cleaning services as resources are stretched to the maximum. “The situation is such that the agency may have no choice but to stop collecting garbage from the beaches,” a source said.

 
  
 
 Tourism minister   said “the process to clear the bills is under way”. 
 
 Drishti was brought on board temporarily after the government terminated the contract with two agencies—Ram Cleaners and Developers Private Limited and Bhumika Clear Tech Services. 
 
 It’s been over a year since then, but the government is yet to float a tender. A official said they had sent the draft tender document for the government’s approval, but is yet to hear from it. The department also informed the government that it does not have the expertise in garbage management.
 
 A source said that the job should have been entrusted to the   rather than the tourism department.
 
 A source said that after all the negative publicity in the last three years over beach cleaning, and allegations of corruption in awarding the contract, some in the department feel that the responsibility should be entirely entrusted to the waste corporation.
