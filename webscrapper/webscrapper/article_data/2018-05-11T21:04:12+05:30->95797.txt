CHENNAI: After residents of   in   complained about a number of abandoned vehicles lining the streets, corporation officials on Thursday reached the area to remove the vehicles only to be stopped by the owners of the vehicles from carrying out their duty. The officials could remove only one vehicle, much to the chagrin of the residents.

 
 According to residents, on Wednesday, the corporation officials had posted notices on these vehicles asking the owners to remove the vehicles within 15 days. But the corporation officials, instead, turned up on Thursday morning to remove the vehicles. The action by the civic body officials upset the owners, who said they needed time to remove the vehicles.
 
 “They moved a TATA Indica that had been parked here for a long time. But as they were preparing to remove another car, the owner came and sat on the road and stopped them from towing the vehicles,” said a passerby.
 
 There are at least six vehicles lining the road of Sai Baba Colony.
 
 The officials then warned the owners of the remaining vehicles to remove them within two days.
 
 When TOI contacted the official seeking a response on why owners were not given time to remove their abandoned vehicles, he said, “There were repeated complaints from residents. We should have given the owners of these abandoned vehicles more time. Now, we will go and check after two days. If they don’t remove them until then, we ourselves will remove them.”
