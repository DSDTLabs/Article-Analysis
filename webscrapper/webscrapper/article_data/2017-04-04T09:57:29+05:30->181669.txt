NEW DELHI: The   against hike in   is set to escalate as talks between the insurance regulator and the truckers brokered by the   failed on Monday.

 Sources said truckers bodies such as   (AIMTC), All India Goods Vehicles Owners Association (ACOGOA), and South India Goods Agents Association (SIMTA) demanded that the hike in premium should be suspended and they should be allowed to go through the data to assess the justification of such a hike. But   (IRDA) did not accept this saying the truckers’ representatives can go through the data and give their suggestions.
  
 “Both stuck to their own agenda and hence there was no result. AIMTC has said it will join the strike in the next few days,” said a source, who was present in the meeting.
  
 TOI has learnt that the truckers’ associations demanded that IRDA should get out of the business of fixing premium for third party insurance and this should be deregulated as it has been done in the case of premium for self-damage. 
  
 “Deregulation of self-damage insurance has worked well. So, the same should be followed here. Let IRDA fix the cap for third party insurance premium and then it will be free for the insurance companies to offer the best price,” said the source.
  
 The crisis has deepened since IRDA went ahead with notifying 41% hike in third party insurance premium unilaterally even after it had assured the road transport ministry to consult the truckers’ associations before kicking in the new norms. The revised premiums have come to effect from April 1.
