NEW DELHI: Minister for women and child development   has sought creation of a mechanism which can look into complaints of men alleging that they have been falsely implicated in cases like domestic violence, dowry and rape.

 In a letter to  , the minister said each complaint should be linked to proper identification through   and a valid phone number. 
 
 Maneka said that she has been “receiving a large number of complaints from men who claim that they have been falsely implicated in cases of dowry, domestic violence, rape etc….”
 
 Maneka explains her point of view saying that while grievances of women should be the first concern of the ministry of WCD but misuse of laws created to protect women should also be a matter of concern. 
 
 While asking “NCW to provide a window to men where they can bring up instances of false complaints against them”, in her letter to   chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam, Maneka asked it to operationalise the grievance mechanism at the earliest and suggested that it could be made part of the online complaint system.
