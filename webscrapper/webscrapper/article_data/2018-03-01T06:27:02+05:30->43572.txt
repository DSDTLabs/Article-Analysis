Actress   says she felt inspired playing the ' ' video games as a child.

  
  
 "I did not have a Playstation at home, sadly - but with my family friends, the boys in their family had a Playstation. 
 
 "I was probably I think around ten-ish when I came there. I remember I looked at the TV screen and I had never seen a girl, a woman being the protagonist in a video game and was thrilled and stood there just watching," Vikander told Games Radar.
 
 In fact, the Swedish actress said the first 'Tomb Raider' game will always mean a lot to her because it made such a lasting impression.
 
 She said: "I would say the first 'Tomb Raider' meant a lot, in the sense that I love adventure films, (and here was) a game where I suddenly could go to  , or   - those were the worlds that I read books about and dreamt to go to when I was a child. That will always mean a lot, because I was quite young."
