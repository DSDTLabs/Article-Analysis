Panaji: If you drink and drive, beware. Goa police has procured 100   and four laser speed radar guns (LSRG) to crack down on drunk driving and speeding. 

 TOI was the first to report the government’s approval of the purchase. As the number of accidents have increased over the years, Goa police had conducted a detailed study which revealed that speeding and drunk driving are among the main causes of accidents and fatalities on Goan roads. 
 
 The new equipment, which costs Rs 60 lakh, has already been put to use by the police, and a number of challans have already been issued. The speed gun can catch any speeding vehicle 300m before it reaches the gun, by which time a photo and video evidence would be captured. The fine is Rs 400 for taxis and Rs 300 for private vehicles. 
 
 Director general of police (DGP) Muktesh Chander told reporters on Tuesday that the laser speed radar guns would be placed at strategic locations to catch violators. Apart from being prosecuted under appropriate provisions of law, the violator’s licence will also be seized and forwarded to the road transport office (RTO) concerned for suspension, which will last around three months. 
 
 Chander said that the LSRGs are portable and can be set up anywhere. He mentioned how speed limits are often violated on the Mandovi and Zuari bridges. He also said that speed guns won’t be placed in locations where there are no speed limit signs. 
 
 Every 30 hours, a person is killed in an accident in Goa either because the deceased or the driver of the other vehicle was rash and negligent. This year, 800 persons have been fined for drunk driving so far.
