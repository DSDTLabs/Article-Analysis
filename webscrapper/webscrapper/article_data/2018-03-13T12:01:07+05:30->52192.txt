BIHARSHARIF: At least 40 hostellers from different branches of   (NCE) were admitted to a hospital in the wee hours of Monday after they complained of nausea, vomiting, loose motion and acute stomach ache.

 Some of the ailing students — Rishav Raj, Siddharta Kumar, Apurva Kumari and Puja Kumari — being treated at the hospital said they ate rice, dal, potato ‘chokha’, curd and salad for   in the hostel around 10pm on Sunday. Soon after midnight, they started feeling uncomfortable and by 4am most of them began vomiting. They also claimed they were taken ill due to the inferior quality of food.
 
 Confirming the claim of the students, one of the hospital doctors, Dr  , said, “It appears to be a case of food poisoning, but the incident should be investigated.” 
 
 He, however, did not talk about the food item that made the students ill.
 
 According to NCE hostel mess in charge Ravi Panday, the students fell ill because of over eating and not food poisoning. “Despite the small amount of money I receive from each student (Rs 72) for three meals and a cup of tea, the quality of food is very good,” he said.
 
 The college’s officiating principal, Dr C B Mahto, who was in the hospital told this newspaper he would take strict action after an investigation was carried out in this connection.
