NEW DELHI: It took about 15 hours for   MP Neeraj Shekhar to complete his 19 minutes speech in the   as the Upper House witnessed repeated protests and adjournments in the past two days. 

  After he was permitted to speak during the budget discussion on Thursday, the SP law maker stood up to speak at 12 in the Rajya Sabha on Friday. But within minutes the House was adjourned due to protests from the TDP members. Even  's Derek O'Brien was spotted expressing his anguish over the adjournment during the first half of Friday. 
 
  Shekhar could speak only when the House resumed post lunch. When he was asked to limit his speech, the visibly upset SP law maker said he had been trying to speak since Thursday and the time allotted for his party was also cut. Targeting Prime Minister   over the "selling pakoda" remark, Shekhar said the PM cannot understand the pain of a father who somehow gets his son educated by going beyond his means.
