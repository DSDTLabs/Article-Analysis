PUNE: The Pune circle unit of the forest department has procured 20 air blowers to fight fires. 

 The forest circle comprises Pune, Bhor and Junnar divisions with ranges that cover Pune district. Forest officials said 875 hectares have been damaged in wild fires in the last three years across the district. 
 
 Vivek Khandekar, chief conservator of forest (Pune), told TOI on Sunday, “Forest fires are a worry and we need equipment to deal with them. The government has given us 20 air blowers, which have been distributed to our Pune, Bhor and Junnar divisions.”
 
 An air blower generates a stream of air at high speed to put out a fire and controls it from spreading on the ground.
 
 Forest officials said fires were set “deliberately” by local villagers. “Since most fires start in the late hours, we cannot reach the spot with equipment because of the rough terrain and other factors,” a senior forest official who did not wish to be named told TOI.
 
 On January 3, forest guard   succumbed to serious burns sustained while controlling a wild fire in Bhor tehsil. “Advanced fire control equipment and a safety kit would have saved him,” the official said. 
 
 The Pune circle has 380 forest guards, 57 officers and 138 forest rangers who need safety kits. Khandekar said, “We have identified places from where   start. Our teams are now camping there to act quickly if fires break out.”
 
 A senior forest official said the government must pay attention to the safety of ground staff who are often in vulnerable situations. “Awareness campaigns for villagers to understand the possible damage caused by forest fires is necessary. Abroad, forest staffers are provided with advanced fire-fighting kits equipped with oxygen masks and fire proof clothing. Advanced methods are being introduced to control fires. China uses helicopters to douse them,” he said.
