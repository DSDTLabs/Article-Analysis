Gaya: With the bidding process initiated, the proposed culture-cum- convention centre at   is likely to be ready in 18 months. 

 While laying the stone of the ambitious project on February 1, CM Nitish Kumar had said the convention centre would have a main auditorium with seating capacity for 2,000 persons, six smaller auditoriums with capacity to seat 500 each and a banquet hall with a capacity to accommodate 1,000 guests. The Rs 145-crore project is being executed by the state building construction department. 
 
 Giving further details, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said on Thursday the state-of-the-art centre would also have an audiovisual chamber. “To be built using earthquake-resistance technique, the structure will have rainwater harvesting, sewerage treatment, sprinkler fire-protection and fire alarm facilities, among others,” he said and added it would also have a multipurpose hall.
 
 The estimated cost of the project was initially Rs 98 crore, which has now been revised to Rs 145 crore, the DM said. Asked about comparatively less footfall of foreign tourists at the recent Buddha Jayanti celebrations, the DM cited lack of air connectivity as the main problem. 
 
 “International flights between Gaya and foreign destinations being seasonal in nature, there are serious connectivity issue around this time of the year as foreign airlines operate flights only between October and March,” he said and pointed out the National Commission for Minorities has raised the connectivity issue at the higher level of governance.
