Kolhapur: District and sessions judge R G Awachat on Thursday sentenced a 45-year-old man to life imprisonment for murdering his elder brother on December 2, 2013 while holding his wife and son guilty under section 325.

 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the   convict, Madhukar Bapu Karale of Naragewadi in Karveer taluka, failure to pay which will mean an additional simple imprisonment of two months.
 
 The judge, however, ordered the release of Karale’s wife Ranjana (37) and son Nilesh alias Sardar (20) as they have already been in jail since December 3, 2013, a day after Dagadu Bapu Karale (60) was murdered.
 
 The mother-son duo were fined Rs 2,000 each, failure to pay which will mean a month’s simple imprisonment. 
 
 Public prosecutor Ashok Randive said that there was a dispute between the two brothers over a piece of land and the matter is pending in court. 
 
 “On the evening of December 2, 2013, the brothers quarrelled over the issue of cutting grass on the controversial land. Soon, the family members of Madhukar and Dagadu started attacking each other with sharp weapons, resulting in Dagadu’s death on the spot,” he said.
 
 Three members of Dagadu’s family were injured in the incident and admitted to the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital (CPR) for treatment, said Randive. 
 
 A total of 15 witnesses were examined during the trial.
