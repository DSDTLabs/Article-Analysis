Ranveer Singh’s affinity for rapping may very well find its way to his next film. If reports are to be believed, the actor will not just stop at singing. He might even write the lyrics of his songs.

  
  
 ‘Gully Boy’ is Ranveer’s second collaboration with director  , after their 2015 multi-starrer ‘Dil Dhadakne Do’. The film sees him paired with ‘Dear Zindagi’ star   for the first time, and Ranveer expressed his excitement about working opposite her in a video on his social media profile.
 
 
  
  
 Ranveer and Alia both play singers who emerge from the streets in ‘Gully Boy’.
