Ludhiana: With the motive of eradicating hunger from society, a city-based NGO called ‘Feeding India’ has launched its first ‘feeding van’ to serve food to poor people residing in slums of the city throughout the day. ‘Feeding India’ member Anirudh Sahi stated that after passing several hardships, the members have successfully launched their ‘feeding van’ to serve food to poor people living in slums across the city.

 He stated: “For this initiative, we have first collected leftover food from several marriage palaces in the city, parties, and different religious functions, and stored them in a cold big freezer so that it remains protected from fungus and spoilage. After that, all the collected foods items have been placed in different drums inside the modified van to feed poor people, mostly children facing malnutrition due to lack of resources. Today, we have distributed the stored food items in a slum near Opkar Nagar. Several children had taken advantage of this initiative on the very first day of its official launch.”
 
 Another member of the NGO said: “This project was possible only because of the hard work done by our members, as we did not get any financial support from either the administration or politicians. One of the best things about this NGO is that it was totally run by students, and the money for food and van is also contributed by students themselves. The message our team would like to convey to Punjabis — who are famous for their lavish weddings, where most of the time huge quantities of food are left over — is that they should, instead of discarding that food, give it to us so that we can feed the poor and needy people of society.”
