VISAKHAPATNAM: Eight months into their second   course, students pursuing the two-year diploma in elementary education ( ) of batch 2016-18 are yet to do their first-year examinations. 

 After repeated pleas and protests, the state government permitted them to appear for the recently concluded Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) which, if qualified, makes them eligible to write the upcoming teacher recruitment test —   (DSC). However, it is not sure whether the government will allow them to write the   exam without them writing their first-year exams.
 
 With a hiatus of three years, the state government this year may announce the DSC notification for 14,000 teachers’ posts in the next one month and fill them before the next academic year commences. DEd students are in a quandary as they now have to prepare for first-year, second-year and DSC exams as they will likely be conducted a few days apart. 
 
 Second year DEd student at the District Institute of Education and Training (Diet), Bheemili, DVS Ratnakar said that future looks grim for them with the growing uncertainty over their exams. “We are currently busy with our record work of   year. If the government conducts DSC during the same time as our exams, we have no choice other than missing the DSC preparation as we cannot ignore our exams. We request the government to plan the exams accordingly,” said Ratnakar
 
 Another second year DEd student V Mounika said that they were promoted to second year in July 2017. “The 2016-18 DEd students pinned their hopes on the teachers’ recruitment through DSC because our course will be completed in the next four months. But we are not sure whether the government will allow us for the DSC. Even if it allows us, we may not be in a condition to prepare for the DSC as our year-end exams will be likely to be conducted at the same time” she said.
