VIJAYAWADA: YSR Congress MLA R K Roja was on Saturday detained at the   for more than two hours as she arrived from Hyderabad to take part in the ongoing National Women's Parliament (NWP) at   here. She was later shifted to Hyderabad. Roja was not allowed to attend the conclave though she was duly registered and invited, as police suspected she "might create trouble" at the venue. In fact, Roja is also a member of the   'welcome and reception committee'. 

 A delegation of YSRC leaders later met director general of police N Sambasiva Rao, protesting against Roja's detention, but was told that there was "credible information" that the MLA was planning to stage a protest at the NWP venue.
 
 The firebrand legislator later at a press meet in Hyderabad said she did not plan to disrupt the event.
 
 Roja claimed that she was detained at the airport on the pretext that Tibetan spiritual guru the Dalai Lama was to take flight to Hyderabad. However, she was escorted by women cops into a car and taken to a police station. The Nagari MLA recorded the episode on her mobile phone as she was being put into a police   and wondered as to why the government was preventing her from attending the NWP.
 
 She demanded to know why the CM Chandrababu Naidu was 'scared' of her participation. "Chandrababu Naidu and the organisers said the event is apolitical. That is the reason why I have come to take part. The police told me that they are taking me to a hotel and instead took me to Guntur," she said. She sought to know from assembly speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao as to why he had extended invitation to her when then they did not want her participation in the first place.
