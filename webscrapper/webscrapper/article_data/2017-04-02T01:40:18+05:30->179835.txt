RAIPUR: A day after   adopted the toughest law against   by making it punishable with a 14-year jail term,   chief minister   said in Jagdalpur on Saturday that those who kill cows in his state “will be hanged”.

 Singh was replying to a question from reporters whether the state government was considering any tough legislation to check cow slaughter. “Is cow slaughter happening anywhere in the state? Have any cows been killed in our state in the last 15 years?” Singh posed a counter-question. Then, with a smile, he said: “Jo gai ko marega, unko latka denge (We will hang those who kill a cow).”
 
 Rejecting the CM’s claim, state Congress general secretary Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said cow slaughter is rampant even in places close to the state capital but no effective action seems to have been taken.
 
 Even those associated with the ruling party are involved in the transportation of agriculture cattle for slaughter, he alleged. “The talk about hanging those who kill cows is just an attempt by the chief minister to go with the flow of  ,” Trivedi remarked.
 
 Raman Singh had taken the initiative to ban cow slaughter in the state in the very first year of his office after coming to power in December 2003. The Chhattisgarh Agricultural Cattle Preservation Act, 2004 provides for imprisonment up to seven years and a fine of Rs 50,000 for the slaughter of cattle, possession of beef and transport of agriculture cattle for slaughter.
