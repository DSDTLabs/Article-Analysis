DHARAMSHALA: Facing opposition from people, the team which had come to seize a 25-year-old ‘Sainik Cafe’ failed to execute the task. The cafe is a prominent place of the town, adjacent to war memorial – a place exhibiting the sacrifice of the soldiers from Himachal Pradesh.

 The show also adorned a political colour as few   leaders were also present there in support of civilians and restaurant owners. After much hue and cry amid strong opposition, the team failed to seal the cafe.
 
 Property belongs to   and was leased out to a former   personnel’s family in the name of Ranjeet Singh. It came into dispute after the welfare board had filed a civil suit to vacate the cafe. The team had come to execute orders of the court of sub-divisional magistrate. It was on January 9, 2017, that the court had ordered in favour of the board.
 
 Counsel for the cafe, Monika Kashyap, told TOI that they had not served the notice of any execution. “Moreover, the officials have no power to bypass court as the matter is pending in divisional magistrate’s court,” she said.
 
 Sub-divisional magistrate Shravan Manta, however, said the order was served to the party and only after that the team had gone to execute the same. “We have served the notice and it is just a legal process which is being followed,” he added.
 
 As the team reached, the people there started asking for the record and copy of the notice. It was said the notice for the execution was not served while it was the simple copy of orders which was sent to them and they had no knowledge of the surprise visit of the team.
