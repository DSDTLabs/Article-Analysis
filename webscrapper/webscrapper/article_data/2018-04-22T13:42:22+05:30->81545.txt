PATNA: The   (PMC) will replace the sodium vapour street lights with light emitting diode (LED) bulbs across the city from May 5 to save power. 

 Delhi-based Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), an energy service company of the government of India, is handling the project with an estimated cost of Rs47 crore.
 
 “The officials of all the 75 PMC wards divided into Bankipore, Pataliputra, Patna City and   circles will conduct a survey to know the exact number of LED bulbs required in the respective areas,” Patna mayor Sita Sahu told this newspaper on Saturday. She said electric poles would also be installed in the areas where there is no light.
 
 There are several localities which go dark after the sunset.   of   said, “We have complained to the ward councillor many times. A bulb was then put up near the Joggers Park a few months ago, but it got diffused within a month. The LED street lights will enhance the visibility at night and keep the roads secure for us.”
 
 Ramna Road hosteller Jigyasa Shree said, “I feel unsafe while going out after sunset as there are many eve-teasers roaming in the area.”
 
 Earlier, around 850 LED bulbs were put up on major routes like Ashiana-Digha Road, Boring Canal Road, Airport Road, 1, Anne Marg, Secretariat, Gandhi Maidan and Patna City. According to sources, these bulbs were installed last year, before and after the closing ceremony of Prakashotsava.
