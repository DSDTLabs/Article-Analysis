HYDERABAD: Buoyed by the fast pace of Kaleshwaram project works, the state government has decided to speed up the works on another flagship project - the  . Though the foundation stone was laid two years ago, the works could not be taken up at a fast pace due to court cases and mandatory environmental clearance from the Centre. 

 "The irrigation department has completed the studies, including the one year pre-monsoon and post-monsoon submergence and the pollution levels, all of which are necessary for obtaining environmental clearance. We will publish the data and put in the public domain to conduct a public hearing soon," irrigation minister T Harish Rao told TOI. 
 
 The Palamuru-Ranga Reddy Lift Irrigation Project is being taken up to irrigate 12.5 lakh acres in erstwhile Mahbubnagar,   and   districts and to provide drinking water for Hyderabad. Of the estimated project cost of 35,000 crore, the state government has allocated 4,000 crore in the budget. 
 
 Officials said the state government has secured Stage I forest clearance for the project area covering 500 acres of forest land near Narlapur village in Kollapur mandal of Nagarkurnool district. 
 
 "The project will be useful not only for farmers but also the general public as it will provide drinking water. The project is being taken up with the least submergence and least environmental damage. Some political leaders approached courts and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to stall the works," Harish Rao said.
 
 Environmental clearance is required as 27,000 acres is being acquired for main trunk works and 37,000 acres for the ayacut. "Main trunk works are going on and ayacut works have not been taken up for want of land," project chief engineer Lingaraju said. The project was designed to lift 1.5 tmcft water in 60 flood days from the foreshore of Srisailam to irrigate seven lakh acres in Mahbubnagar district, five lakh acres in Ranga Reddy and 30,000 acres in Nalgonda.
