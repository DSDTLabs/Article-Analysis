LUCKNOW: The   Chandan Gupta on Tuesday disclosed here on Tuesday that he had donated blood to a Muslim youth just days before he was killed during the   on January 26.

 Since his death, the family also made their first official demand for declaring Chandan a martyr, saying he took a bullet for keeping the respect and honour of ‘Mother India’. The family made these assertions in a three-page hand-written letter by Chandan’s sister Kirti that she handed over to UP CM Yogi Adityanath.
 
 January 26, 2018 ke kuch din purv hi usne ek Muslim ko apna khoon diya aur uski jan bachaye. Mera Bhai Chandan Gupta garibo ko kapde dena, unko khana khilana aur swasth chikitsa karwta tha. Mera bhai logo ko galat kaam karne se rokta tha. Agar Hindustan mai rehakar   aur ‘Bharat Ma ki Jai’ bolna galat hai toh mere bhai ko doshi karar kar de. (He had donated his own blood to a Muslim and saved his life...If chanting   slogans is wrong, then either declare him an offender or call him a martyr. It is a request from his sister Kirti and mother Sangita, declare him a martyr),” the letter states.
 
 The family has claimed that Chandan had frequent run-ins with some Muslim boys who would litter at a local temple compound and eve-teasers among them. “If the chief minister does not honour him, then no mother would ever send her son to hoist a flag or participate in a tiranga yatra” the letter points out.
 
 The letter also narrated the sequence of the events on day of the tragic incident. Without referring to any community, Kirti in her letter stated that members of one group told Tiranga Yatra men that they would happily scream Hindustan Zindabad chants if they hear Pakistan Zindabad slogans from them.
