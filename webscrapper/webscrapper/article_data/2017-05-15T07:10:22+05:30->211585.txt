 Speaking to TOI, deputy director of the ground water and water audit department KS Sastry said the fall in groundwater levels are due to insufficient rainfall coupled with increasing demand for water. 
 
 “People are also digging more and more borewells which has led to excessive use of groundwater. The water levels will improve if there is good rainfall in the subsequent days and timely onset of the southwest monsoon,” he added. 
 
 “Groundwater depletion can be controlled if the corporation takes up certain measures such as ensuring that every apartment complex has rainwater harvesting pits,” assistant professor at Gitam University D   said, adding that vigil on excess use of groundwater and regular checks on leakages are also needed to save water. 
 
 “We receive nearly 40-50 complaints regarding pipeline leakages and borewell damage in GVMC limits,” said an official from the GVMC water supply wing.
