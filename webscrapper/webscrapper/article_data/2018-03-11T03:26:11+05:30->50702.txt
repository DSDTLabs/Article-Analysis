GHAZIABAD: Nearly 10 months after Chandrapal Singh Saini’s  , who has learning difficulties, went missing from his maternal uncle’s home in Jatwara, the SSP has been asked to conduct a probe into the case.

 A retired employee of the electricity department and a resident of Meerut, Saini (66), has been making rounds of Sihani Gate police station seeking the help of cops to trace his grandson, but the police have allegedly told him to find the boy himself.
 
 “My grandson Rohit (19) went to his maternal uncle’s house in Jatwara with his mother on May 8, 2017. He stepped out in the evening without informing anyone. When he did not return, a search was conducted, but he was not found. Two days later, a missing person’s report was lodged at Sihani Gate police station, but no effort was made by the police to trace Rohit,” Chandrapal told TOI.
 
 The matter was brought to the knowledge of DGP OP Singh during an interactive session on Twitter on March 8. He asked SSP H N Singh to conduct an inquiry. “The matter is quite old, but as soon as it was brought to my notice, I ordered an inquiry. Teams have been formed to locate the boy,” said H N Singh.
