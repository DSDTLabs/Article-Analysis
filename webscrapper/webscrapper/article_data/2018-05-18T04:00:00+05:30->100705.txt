Mumbai: New-age   has tied up with  ,   and   to insure   phones. The insurance covers any loss to mobile phones upon payment of premium up to 10%, depending on the kind of cover the customer chooses.

 According to Digit chief marketing officer Sandeep Komaravelly, surveys have showed that 10-15% of mobile phones suffer screen damage in one year and the average cost of repair ranges between 50% and 60% of the phone’s price. “The typical life of a mobile phone is 18 months. Thus, with more newer models, the repairability of old models is challenging,” said Komaravelly. Digit expects to see a clearer trend on the incidence of damage after it has sold close to one lakh policies.
 
 Buyers can choose a limited cover for screen damage — the most common damage — or for a package which includes all accidental damages and theft. The three online retailers account for a large chunk of mobile phones sold in the country.
 
 Since the premiums are paid digitally, the claims can also be settled by moving money to the customer’s account. This is one reason why the e-insurance sale is taking off.
 
 “With respect to claims on mobile product, 77% of the customers do the inspection on their own through the video/self-diagnostics app that we have, and because of this, 94% of the claims have been approved within 24 hours. Depending on the option chosen by the customer, the claim amount is credited into the customer account or settled directly with the repair centre,” said Komaravelly.
 
 This is a continuation of the company’s digital strategy to sell online through partners with policies being generated automatically in straight-through transactions. Earlier the company had tied up with Sterling Holidays and Cleartrip for travel insurance. Similarly, the company has tied up with Titan’s Tanishq jewellery chain for insurance. Tanishq customers can buy the cover for theft and accidental damages.
