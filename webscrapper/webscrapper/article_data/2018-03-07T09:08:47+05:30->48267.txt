THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: All India democratic women's association (AIDWA) has asked the government to implement the   in the private sector too. Declaring a charter of demands ahead of International Women's Day,   state secretary   said, "The Indian Maternity Benefit Act assures paid maternity leave of about 26 weeks for women employees. But, women employees working in private sectors are not getting this benefit. They are only getting 12 weeks of maternity leave. This is not acceptable. Every woman should be treated equally at least in this matter." 

 The other key demands of AIDWA include providing proper security to women working in different sectors, implementation of prevention of sexual harassment act strictly in work places and assuring minimum 250 days of work under   to a family. AIDWA will use women's day as a platform to assert its demand for the passage of women's reservation bill.
 
 "This year's women's day observance aims to raise the demands and rights of unorganized women workers across the state. They are being exploited day by day. The Union government has not done anything in favour of women workers. Our demands also include passage of women's reservation bill. This Women's Day observance is to convey message of unity and solidarity to end crimes against women", said Susan Kodi, president of AIDWA.
 
 The association will organize rallies in all districts on Thursday. In Thiruvananthapuram, the celebration will be held at Gandhi Park where various events will be organized.
