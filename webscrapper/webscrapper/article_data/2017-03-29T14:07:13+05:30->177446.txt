  A small community in Virginia has been evacuated over an explosion at a nearby plant. All the nearby water supplies have to be checked for contamination before any of them can return. While this doesn’t qualify as terrorism, it’s the latest viral crafting of fake news. Someone accessed the Cache to pull this off, so there’s potential to get another name on the collaborator family tree.
  
  Shelby (Johanna Braddy) realises that a bunch of the IP addresses for the material coming out about the blast are all coming from the same location, not far away. Once Dayana (Pearl Thusi ) realizes that most of the tweets spreading information about the damage originate in the same place, they’re sure that it’s a troll farm.
  
  When Clay asks Shelby about how she traces the IP addresses, she tells him that her boyfriend who is a photojournalist, taught her.
  
  Nimah (Yasmine Al Massri) is missing from the brainstorm. Hearing that she was not a real team member but a mascot, made her upset.
  
  With enough evidence, Clay says that the group can pay a visit to the trolls. The only problem is that this crew, in case you forgot and needed to be reminded for the 70th time, is highly illegal and covert. There are ongoing FBI and CIA investigations into this group and they can’t compromise any active missions. They decide that Alex and Harry (Russell Tovey), who has done work with this faction before, will go in and pretend to be in the market for a fake news campaign.
