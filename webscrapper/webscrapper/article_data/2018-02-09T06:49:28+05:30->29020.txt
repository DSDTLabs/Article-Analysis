HYDERABAD: Task Force police arrested a   on Thursday who committed 11 offences after he was released from Preventive Detention (PD). Police recovered 31 tola gold and 1.25 lakh from him.

Ayyan used to wear helmet and ride the bike and his pillion riding associate would wear a mask while committing an offence," police commissioner   said.
 
 As he was aware of police nabbing snatchers with the help of   footage, Ayyan always wore helmet while committing an offences. He also used fake registration plates to evade police dragnet.
 
 "Ayyan used to park the bike away from his house to ensure police will not identify his house even if they track his movement after a snatching," the commissioner said.
