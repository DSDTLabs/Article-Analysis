CHENNAI: A 38-year-old software professional riding pillion on her husband’s motorcycle suffered severe injuries when a robber on another motorcycle grabbed her   chain, throwing her off the bike and onto the road near   on Thursday night.

 The robber viciously attacked the bleeding woman before he and his accomplice, who was riding the motorcycle, sped away with her jewellery — a mugging of a heightened audacity that has accompanied a spike in similar crimes in the city.
 
 Police said P  , a techie with a private firm at Sholinganallur, and her husband Pugazhendi, 42, were returning home to an apartment complex in Thaiyur when the robbers accosted them at 10pm.
 
 Poornima and her husband were on the stretch between Kelambakkam and Thaiyur on Old Mahabalipuram Road when the robbers attempted to accost them, an investigating officer said.
 
 “Pugazhendi was giving Poornima a ride home from her office when two men on a bike approached them, pretending to ask for directions to an address,” the officer said. “Pugazhendi did not stop and the men followed the couple.”
 
 “They soon closed the gap and the pillion rider snatched Poornima’s chain,” he said. “She resisted and her husband lost control of his bike. Both Pugazhendi and Poornima fell on the road and were in a daze when one of the robbers slapped her and took her chain.”
 
 Poornima was bleeding from the neck and head. Her husband cried out for help but, by the time passersby came to their aid, the robbers had escaped.
 
 “A man who witnessed the crime called for an ambulance and Poornima’s husband admitted her to a hospital,” the officer said.
 
 The Kelambakkam police have launched a search for the suspects.
 
 “The man riding the bike was wearing a helmet but Pugazhendi could describe what the pillion rider looked like,” the officer said.
