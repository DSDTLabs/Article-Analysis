Panaji: The Congress on Thursday raised questions over chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s decision to visit the US without appointing an interim chief minister.

 “The desecration of religious crosses or Hindu idols is a sensitive issue and a political turn should not be given to such an issue. The Congress does not want to politicise it but at the same time, the government cannot sleep or go out of the country,” All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Girish Chodankar said.
 
 The Congress said that during such a critical time, it was necessary for Parrikar to delegate decision-making powers to an interim chief minister who could oversee the law and order situation in the state. “It appears that the chief minister does not trust his colleagues.”
 
 Chodankar went on to add that the Congress was willing to provide all the help required by the government to “catch and punish those responsible for vandalising sacred places” across Goa, especially South Goa. Chodankar said the series of incidents was an attempt to “intimidate people and create communal tension”.
 
 The Congress appealed to all parties and stakeholders to combat communal disturbance. “We don’t want to politicise the desecration of crosses and ghumtis. All we want is that the government ensure that from the next day onwards, not a single such incident should occur in the state. This is our warning to the government,” Chodankar said.
