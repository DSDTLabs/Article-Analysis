KOCHI:   principal sessions court, on Friday, denied bail to policemen Jithin Raj, Santosh Kumar and Sumesh, the first three accused in the   custodial death case.

 The policemen, who had taken   SR into custody, were members of the nowdefunct Rural Tiger Force (RTF). Murder charges were filed against them for assaulting Sreejith in custody which eventually led to his death.
 
 The court denied their bail plea even as the high court had, on Monday, granted bail to the fourth accused   who is also facing murder charges in the case. The ex-RTF personnel can now approach the high court seeking bail.
 
 SI Deepak was granted bail by the court after considering the statement given by Sreejith to the doctor, he did not mention the role of Deepak.
 
 The court also considered the statement of Sreejith's wife to the magistrate. There was no mention of the SIâ€™s role after she talked to Sreejith.
 
 The case pertains to the incident that happened on April 6 when Sreejith SR of Varapuzha was taken into custody after police mistook him to be an accused in a house attack case. The man died in custody on April 9.
