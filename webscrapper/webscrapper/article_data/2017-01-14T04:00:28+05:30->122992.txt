MUMBAI: The state transport department will set up a special squad in the city to curb cases of private vehicles ferrying passengers and operating as public transport without valid permits in commercial hubs of the city. Transport commissioner   said, “I have written to senior traffic police officers, requesting them to deploy a few cops for the new squad.” 

 The squad will fine violators on-the-spot and also confiscate vehicles and cancel driving licences.
 
 Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union leader   said his members were willing to assist any such squad. “We are aware of the areas in the island city and suburbs where passengers are being illegally ferried by private buses and cars. Our union members can accompany the squad and help them catch the accused,” he said.
 
 On Friday, Rao had taken a delegation to the transport commissioner’s office in   to protest against the recent hike in licence and registration fees of vehicles. “We are only demanding that auto and taxi drivers should be exempted from the recent hikes. Else, it could result in some drivers spending Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 annually and this is equivalent to a month’s earnings for some,” he pointed out.
