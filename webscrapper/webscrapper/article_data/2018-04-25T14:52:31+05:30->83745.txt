TIRUPUR: Posing as Income Tax sleuths, a six-member gang robbed a knitwear manufacturing unit owner’s house of Rs 4 lakh cash and   near Neruperichal here on Tuesday morning. To evade arrest, they also took away the digital video recorder (DVR) of CCTV cameras installed in the house.

 The incident took place when K Sivakumar, 45, left for his knitwear manufacturing unit. “My wife Santhamani, 15-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter were at home. Six men came to my house at   in an SUV around 11.30am and told my family that they were I-T officials and wanted to conduct a raid,” Sivakumar told TOI.
 
 One of his kin said the men did not show their identity cards. “After entering the house, they made Santhamani and children sit at different places. They also gave some files to the children. While one of them kept quizzing Santhamani, others conducted the search,” the relative said.
 
 After taking possession of valuables, Sivakumar said, the gang asked the family about the DVR of the three CCTV cameras installed outside the house and took it with them.
 
 Santhamani said the men did not make any phone call or use names while speaking. “When my husband’s friend came to the house asking for him, the gang wanted me to send away the visitor quickly. They also made me sign in a declaration form and told me to contact their Coimbatore office,” she said.
 
 When the men left after the raid that lasted for about 20 minutes, Santhamani called up her husband and narrated the incident. “My wife did not raise any alarm while the gang was in the house as she feared for the safety of our children,” Sivakumar said.
 
 A senior police officer said it seemed to be a well-planned robbery. “The gang might have chosen the house on the outskirts of the city considering the advantage.”
 
 The Anupparpalayam police have registered a case and further investigations are on.
