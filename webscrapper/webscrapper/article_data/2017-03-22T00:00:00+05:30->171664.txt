Known for providing a hearty laugh to both audiences and celebrity guests, Srujan Lokesh’s 
 is easily one of the most popular sitcoms on Kannada  . But seems like a recent episode of the show had a section of the audience and a few religious custodians of the   raising their hackles after Srujan allegedly compared a   to the   ritual that is followed in coastal  .
The context was where a member of the audience asked Srujan that if in accordance to a popular saying government work is God’s work, then what can a call centre job be compared to? Srujan then retorts that it is Bhootharadhane since that, too is a ritual that is held at night.
 When 
 spoke to  , he immediately offered to apologize to his viewers in the instance of hurting their religious beliefs. “What I actually meant to convey was that work is worship be it a day job like that of a government employee or a night job like that of a BPO worker or a night watchman. The show has a format where things are said in a lighter vein when it comes to individuals. But in the case of religious rituals, I would never poke fun as I value them too,” sums up Srujan.
