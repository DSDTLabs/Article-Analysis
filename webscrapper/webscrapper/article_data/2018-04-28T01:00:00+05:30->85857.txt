Naseeruddin Shah’s   had encapsulated the actor’s journey in the movie business. It also dwelled on the ups and downs in his personal and professional lives, bringing the lesser-known aspects into the spotlight. Now, BT has it that the actor is penning the   part of the book and this time around, he plans to keep it all very politically correct. The senior actor has been investing time to put his thoughts together and we hear that the second book will begin where the first part concluded.

 “It took   sir six years to write the first part. He might take that much time to write the second part, too, but this time, he plans to put down his observations of the industry and its ways in third person. He’s toying with the idea of writing about his brushes with the industry’s men and women in a funny, yet insightful manner without making it too personal,” says a source close to the actor.
