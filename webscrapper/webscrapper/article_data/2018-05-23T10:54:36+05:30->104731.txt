KOLKATA: Even as Kolkata fans stood in queue for long hours — on a humid Tuesday that gave way to heavy shower in the evening — to lay their hands on match tickets for the eliminator between KKR and Rajasthan Royals, a rain threat looms large over the match on Wednesday.

 According to the met office, there are chances of heavy rainfall in the afternoon. If that happens, it will have a major impact on the game, especially since there is no reserve day kept. “On Wednesday, there would be partly cloudy sky in Kolkata with possibility of rain or thundershower,” said Sanjeev Bandyopadhyay, the deputy director general of IMD Kolkata.
 
 If Wednesday’s game gets called off, KKR will advance as they finished ahead of RR on the points table in league stage.
 
 According to a private weather site, there is 51% chance of rain in Kolkata till 1pm. Although the website suggests that the chances of a shower will decrease to 33% by the evening, chances are expected to increase to 51% again at 7pm, when the game is scheduled to begin on Wednesday.
 
 The fans are, however, not bothered about the rain and with all tickets sold out, it is expected to be a packed house. “Even if it is a five-over-a-side match, we will stay back till the end. We had done it earlier and for a game of this stature, we will definitely not miss it at any cost,” said Subhadeep Mitra, a resident of Ballygunge and an avid KKR fan.
