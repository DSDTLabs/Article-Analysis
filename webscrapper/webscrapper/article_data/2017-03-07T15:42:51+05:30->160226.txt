MARGAO: Two students of a reputed institute allegedly desecrated the Holy Eucharist during mass at Our Lady of Snows Church, Rachol, on Sunday morning but were let off after they apologised.

 Rachol parish priest Fr Eremito   said the two students desecrated the Holy Communion and also recorded the act on their cellphone. They were caught by the local parishoners, who were about to beat them up when Rebello intervened and stopped them. 
 
 Rebello asked the students about their backgrounds and was shown identity cards of the educational institute. The students were asked to call their teachers, but, with no teacher showing up after three and a half hours, the boys were handed over to   police. 
 
 “Both boys, along with four professors, submitted a written apology seeking forgiveness. Since their careers could be jeopardised if this criminal case is registered against them, we forgave them. We also requested the boys not to repeat this incident that hurts the religious sentiments of another individual,” said Rebello. Maina-Curtorim PSI Alvito Rodrigues said that since no complaint had been registered, they were let off with a warning.
