JAIPUR: The fate of 240 students of the five-year integrated degree at Law College in   hangs in balance due to the callousness of the university administration. The   (BCI) website list of affiliated colleges shows the five-year law college affiliation valid till 2014-15. 

 The affiliation was not extended due to acute shortage of teachers and absence of basic facilities. It has no permanent faculty. The teachers are drawn either from constituent law college of RU or guest faculties from other colleges. The required number of faculties is 21. 
 
 Even after the deadline of the recognition, the university has continued admissions for three years making the students in the first, second and third year illegal, unless the BCI gives an exemption on humanitarian grounds.
 
  Six students including four girls are staging an indefinite hunger strike demanding the intervention of the HRD ministry. Umaid Chaudhary, Rishabh Yadav, Suman Meena, RP Solanki, Urmila Meena and   till the last report came were on indefinite hunger strike.
