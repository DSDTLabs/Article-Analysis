SEOUL: South Korean President   could make a trip to Singapore for a threeway summit with his US and North Korean counterparts next month, depending on the outcome of ongoing discussions between Washington and Pyongyang, a top official said here on Monday.

 
 The trip, if made, will likely be made around June 12 when US President   and North Korean leader   are likely to hold their bilateral summit, the official from Seoul’s presidential office told Yonhap News Agency. “The discussions are just getting started, so we are still waiting to see how they come out, but depending on their outcome, the president could join President Trump and Chairman Kim in Singapore,” the official said.
 
 A three-way summit was originally proposed by Moon and the North Korean leader when they held their firstever meeting at the border village of Panmunjom on April 27. The presidential office said the Seoul government was already studying the possibility of a three-way summit but that nothing has been decided or even discussed between the countries.
 
 Trump on Sunday confirmed that a US team, led by former US ambassador to Seoul Sung Kim, had reached North Korea to “make arrangements for the summit between Kim Jong-un and myself ”.
