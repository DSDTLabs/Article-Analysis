Being friends for over six years, for  , aka  , Chandan Shetty’s win on   is like a personal victory. Chandan met his friend days before he entered the house, and the tips that Keerthi gave him sure seem to have helped. We caught up with Keerthi after the finale, who, with his family and friends, watched and celebrated Chandan’s win on Sunday night.

 “Chandu deserves this win. Before the results were announced, my mother said that if Chandu wins, she will not feel bad anymore about me being last season’s runner-up. That’s how close we are. While watching the finale, I was as tensed as I was during my finale. This year, a candidate who is truly deserving and who has won hearts is the winner,” says a jubilant Keerthi.
