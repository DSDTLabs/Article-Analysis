There have been several long-lasting friendships that have emerged from the film industry. From   and Arya to Venkat Prabhu’s Chennai 600028 gang, actors do really know how to have fun with colleagues-turned-friends. But did you know   and   have been friends for years now? Well, this ‘accidental’ friendship emerged at an acting school, we hear. 

 “We met at an acting school. There were around 24 students in our class and I heard there is one guy from Chennai whose name is Vikram Prabhu. So, I was like, ‘Hmm.. Prabhu, what are the odds that he could be   uncle’s son?’ So, I called my dad and he confirmed that it was Prabhu uncle’s son. Back then, our families didn’t meet often. So, I knew of him before he knew who I was. And we were very careful about the way we introduced ourselves in class — I said my father was a lawyer and he said his family came from production side. It is an undue advantage to come from a film background and we didn’t want that to happen. So, I took advantage of the fact that he didn’t know my background. One fine day, I told him, ‘So, your dad is in my house having lunch with my dad.’ He figured out that I was from Kerala and he guessed every single person that the family knew, but he had no clue I was Mammootty’s son. Finally, we were just walking to Prithvi Theatre to watch a play and he said, ‘Please just tell me, who you are. Enough of the suspense.’ And then I broke the news! I still remember he gave me a tight hug. And now, we are good family friends and our wives are close, too. We also have ideas of working together if the right story comes by.”
