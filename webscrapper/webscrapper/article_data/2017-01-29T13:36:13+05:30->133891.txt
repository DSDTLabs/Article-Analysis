PANAJI Prime Minister Narendra   took a dig at AAP and said the party was “looking for excuses” as they know they won’t be able to win in Punjab and Goa. “I have read in the media that they (AAP) have said that the PMO put pressure on the election commission to hold the   on the same date in Goa and Punjab,” Modi told an election rally here on Saturday, without directly naming AAP.

 “If you don’t trust the umpire, then why do you come to play the game,” he asked. “This means they are preparing themselves for defeat in the assembly polls and are trying to find excuses for the defeat,” Modi said.
 
 Goa and Punjab go to polls on February 4.
 
 He also said some of the opposition parties were working overtime to criticize the Budget that his government will present on February 1. “They are putting in more efforts than the finance minister and preparing a draft to attack the government even before the Budget without even having an idea of what is going to be in the Budget. Some of them have even lined up economists to criticize it,” he said.
 
 Modi said the opposition was creating an atmosphere to blame for their defeat. “They are aware they will not win the elections in any of the five states—Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur—and they do not want to take responsibility for their defeat,” he said.
