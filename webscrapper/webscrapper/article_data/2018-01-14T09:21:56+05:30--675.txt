CHANDIGARH: A precariously tilted streetllight pole, located on the road divider of Sector 33 and 34, has been giving nightmares to the commuters. 

 The pole, which is gradually uprooting from its cemented foundation on the divider and is bending closer to the ground, has placed itself as a looming threat over people's heads.
 
 The commuters are scared to pass beneath the slanting spoke, fearing its fall anytime. "I was on a scooter the other day and I suddenly saw this   looming over my head. It can fall anytime," said  , a commuter.
 
 The light pole is seen to be coming out of its firm position from within the ground and is surrounded by broken concrete tiles and slabs, exposing its wiring as well. A reflector located right next to the pole has also broken and bent after being pushed by the pole. 
 
 "The pole has been in this condition for many days now. But, nobody seems to be much bothered by this. This can result in a huge accident anytime," said  , a passerby. 
 
 When asked about the reason behind this issue, many of the rickshaw-drivers blamed the weak foundation of the streetlight. "We do not exactly know how did this happened, but it looks like, the strong winds are behind this," said  , a rickshawpuller.
 
 However, when asked about raising the issue with the municipal corporation (MC), the passers-by blamed the local residents for not taking the matter seriously enough to report it yo get it repaired.
