CHANDIGARH: Fortis surgeon Dr Mukut Minz, a veteran of more than 3,300   transplants, received a   Shri from President Pranab Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhawan on Thursday for contribution to medicine.

 He led the AIIMS (All-India Institute of Medical Sciences) team in New Delhi that carried out external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj’s kidney transplant. Dr Minz made a combined kidney-pancreas transplant programme for type-1 diabetics with kidney failure to turn the PGI into a leading pancreas transplant centre in north India. 
 
 He set up a new department of renal transplant surgery in the PGI.
 
 He mentored the teams that performed complicated procedures such as AV fistulas for hemodialysis, in which an artery-vein connection is made to remove and return blood during dialysis. Dr Minz, formerly head of the PGI’s transplant surgery department, joined the elite medical institute in 1980 and has more than 30 years of experience in transplant surgery.
 
 In 2008, he became senior professor, and in 2015, a member of the PGI’s Governing Body. He received advanced training in organ retrieval and transplantation from the universities of Oslo (Norway), Gothenburg (Sweden), Heidelberg (Germany), Munich (Germany), and Minnesota (Minneapolis, US). He has trained more than 30 transplant surgeons, many of whom teach in India, the US, the UK, and Australia. He is visiting professor to various Indian universities.
