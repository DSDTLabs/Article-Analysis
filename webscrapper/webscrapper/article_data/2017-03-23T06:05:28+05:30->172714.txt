VISAKHAPATNAM: Contrary to the popular notion that people in rural areas or those associated with the agro sector aren’t at much risk of developing lifestyle diseases, a recent study done among the farming community of   district shows that 17.4% already suffer from high levels of blood sugar.

 For the study, a medical camp to screen   was organised at Rythu Bazar, Seethammadhara over the weekend. It was conducted by the   of South. 500 poor farmers were examined. Padmashree general physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who was the principal investigator of the camp, said, “When examined, 17.4% (that is 70 farmers) were found to be suffering from high levels of blood sugar on fasting, ranging from 430 to 470 mg/dl. According to  , fasting plasma glucose more than 110 mg/dL is considered as diabetic. It was noted that 70% of them did not even know that they have diabetes.”
 
 As per the global literature on diabetes among the agrarian sector, the prevalence of Type II diabetes (Diabetes Mellitus) is significantly lower among farmers. The low relative risk was explained by high levels of physical activity and better meal quality, indicating that farmers’ lifestyles and their work environment are health-promoting. But the results of the study in the Indian context pointed to something quite contrary. It shows alarming trends of the metabolic disorder diabetes mellitus among peasants. “Even though, the farming community is associated with hard work, good food habits, eating plenty of fresh vegetables, leading low stressful life, the prevalence of diabetes in a considerable section of the community, is a cause for concern,” said the doctor and added that malnutrition, poor dietary intake, frequent infections, economical stress, pressing bank loans, use of pesticides in crops, are the leading causes for developing diabetes among peasants in this part of India.
