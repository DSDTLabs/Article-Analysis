It’s D-day — Amitabh Bachchan-starrer 'Sarkar 3' opens in cinemas today. ‘Yeh aadmi tab tak nahi haarega jab tak janta uski taraf hai’ is one of the most recalled lines from the promos of the film. The dialogue perfectly fits Big B, who returns to his angry avatar as Subhash Nagre with the third outing in the Godfather-like franchise. Apart from a stellar performance, the actor has also lent his voice to a Ganesh aarti, one of the highlights of the film. Here’s what you can look forward to in this 'Sarkar' outing, apart from Bachchan Sr’s intimidating stares and whistle-worthy one-liners... Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma (RGV) and Amitabh Bachchan have collaborated on the Sarkar franchise after a nine-year hiatus. Bachchan’s character is reportedly inspired by Balasaheb Thackeray. The first two outings met with critical and commercial success. 'Sarkar 3' attempts to take the legacy forward, keeping the tone, tenor and the method of making the film intact. Joining Bachchan Sr is a battery of performers —Manoj Bajpayee (Govind Deshpande), Jackie Shroff (Michael Valya), Yami Gautam (Annu Karkare) and Amit Sadh (Sarkar’s grandson) to name a few. They play new characters whose lives are entwined with Sarkar’s. Evident in the promo, Sarkar has thicker allies and mightier enemies than ever before, which bring in the requisite twist to the plot. On his part, RGV says, “When we made 'Sarkar Raj', we hadn’t decided if we would follow it up with another film. But over the years, I realised 'Sarkar' had impacted the lives of cinegoers and I should come up with another story. Sarkar is a realistic superman. Whenever he encounters a problem, he deals with it with a lot of maturity and strength despite a thousand twists and turns. And that’s what people can expect from 'Sarkar 3'.”
