Tirupur: A group of farmers from Anaipalayam have petitioned the district administration against four textile bleaching units situated on the banks of Noyyal river that allegedly release industrial effluents into the river and its canals. They requested authorities to take action against the units, which allegedly violate zero liquid discharge (ZLD) norms, to save the river and also the Anaipalayam irrigation tank. Agriculture on 600 acres depends on the water from the tank, the farmers said. “We have seen four bleaching units releasing untreated industrial effluents into the open land, which then flow into the river and also to the main canal of Anaipalayam tank. The most recent instance was on last Friday, when one of the units involved in the violation during night time. When we questioned, the unit owners threatened us,” D Karuppasamy, a farmer, said. “Only recently, the farmers have collectively taken steps to desilt the tank and its canals as well as strengthening its bunds, on supervision of the public works department. But, those bleaching units continue to violate the environmental norms in the region,” he added.
