 On Monday, SCB CEO Chandra Sekhar sent a letter to the   ( ) urging the officers to keep the ground open for sporting activities. “Responding to many representations received from veteran sportsmen, elected representatives and locals, I have written a letter to the Station Commander, Head Quarters, Telangana and Andhra Sub Area ( ), Hyderabad, to keep the football ground open,” Chandra Sekhar told TOI.
  
  
 “In the letter, I also stated that though the ground is categorized as ‘A-1 Defence Land’, it is meant for sports only. Since the football ground is the only open space for football and cricket enthusiasts in the entire Cantonment, a decision has to be taken to allow them at least for a few hours during morning and evening hours,” he said.
 
 For the last one week, the Army personnel have been preventing locals from practising football and cricket at the ground, stating the premises was for training soldiers. The Army personnel had also put up a signboard on the premises declaring it a ‘military training area’.
 
 The locals, veteran football players and the SCB ward members had even met the LMA and requested the officials not to shut the ground. However, there was no reply from the LMA. The LMA might take a decision on opening the ground in a day or two, SCB CEO added.
