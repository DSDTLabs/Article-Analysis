BENGALURU: It has been almost five years since the   (Gail) commenced delivery of gas from   in Maharashtra to Bengaluru through its 1,000-km long pipeline. However, implementation of the Bengaluru City Gas Distribution (CGD) project to deliver piped natural gas ( ) to households has been tardy. 

 Union minister of state for statistics and programme implementation   on Thursday reviewed the project's progress, saying only 4,700 households in Bengaluru are using PNG. "As many as 1.32 lakh households will get PNG connections in two years. Gail   has already created infrastructure to provide connections to 57,000 households," said Goel.
 
  "Work on CNG stations in Laggere, Sumanahalli, Hennur and   has been completed. Another 14 CNG stations will be set up soon," said a senior official of Gail Gas Limited.
