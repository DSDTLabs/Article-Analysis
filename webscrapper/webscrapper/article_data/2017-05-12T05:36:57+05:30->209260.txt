LUCKNOW: A 29-year-old man committed suicide by shooting himself in Vikasnagar on Thursday.

 The deceased, identified as Anurag Bisht, worked for a private firm in   and lived alone in Vikasnagar. His parents were no more and he was a bachelor. At 5pm, his sister Poonam, who lives with her husband in Jankipuram, visited him and found his room locked from inside. When Anurag did not open the door despite repeated knocks on it, Poonam sought the help of his neighbours who broke into the room, only to find the man lying in a pool of blood. 
 
 Poonam told police that she had been calling Anurag on his phone since Wednesday evening but he hadn’t taken her calls. Worried, she had turned up at his door to check on him. Vikasnagar sub-inspector Lokesh said a country-made pistol was recovered from the site and the body had been sent for autopsy. No suicide note was recovered from the spot. There was one bullet wound on his left temple. “Why he took such an extreme step is yet not clear,” said Lokesh.
