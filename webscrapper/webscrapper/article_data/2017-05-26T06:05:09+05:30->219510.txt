Lucknow: The special   court, conducting daily hearing of the 1992 Babri demolition case, deferred framing of charges against six Sangh Parivar leaders as just one of them appeared it on Thursday. The court asked them to be present on May 30 for framing of charges, and said no further adjournment would be allowed. 

 Six other saffron leaders - LK  , former Union minister Murli  , cabinet minister Uma Bharti, MP Vinay Katiyar, Sadhvi Ritambhara and Vishnu Hari Dalmiya - would be charged for their role in the conspiracy behind the   demolition on Friday. 
 
  On Thursday, Satish Pradhan appeared before the court, saying charges should be framed against him because he was ill and unable to walk, while five accused - Nritya Gopal Das, Ram Vilas Vendanti, Baikunth Lal Sharma, Champat Rai and Dharm Das - sought exemption. But CBI judge SK Yadav turned it down, saying it was not possible to frame charges as all the accused were not present . 
 
 While the special CBI court had dropped conspiracy charged against the leaders in 2001, the Allahabad high court had upheld the order in 2010. The CBI moved the  , which in its April 19, 2017 order, asked the CBI court to add conspiracy charges against the accused in the trial. 
 
  Two other accused- Ashok Singhal and Giriraj Kishore - died during the trial. 
 
 On April 19, 2017, while ordering restoration of conspiracy charges against the accused, the Supreme Court ordered that both the cases should be clubbed and a composite trial should be held at the Lucknow court. It also asked the court to start daily hearing and finish it within two years.
