SURAT: A 20-year-old mentally ill woman was united with her family after four years on Monday since being found crying alongside the body of her dead father in   in 2012. Police’s sincere efforts have paid off, raising hopes for improvement in her mental condition too.

 Usha Vasava, a resident of Ankleshwar, had come to Kamrej on National Highway-8 with her father Ramesh in 2012. She used to help her father in picking up plastic from waste and on April 25, Ramesh died near a petrol pump in Kamrej. Ramesh, who was suffering from tuberculosis, died suddenly. Usha was with him and was unable to understand what happened to him. She was crying when the police reached the spot and the former could not provide her address to them. She kept saying Ankleshwar when officials asked her about address. The police got her admitted to Women’s Security Home. 
 
 Meanwhile, in a recent meeting at the WSH, Mukesh Patel, assistant commissioner of police, F division, Surat, collected her details and shared them with his colleagues in Bharuch. Taking interest in the case, Bharuch police put efforts to search the family with Usha’s photos and that of her father’s body. Some local people on   of Ankleshwar identified her and helped police reach Usha’s uncle and aunt who lived at Meriya village of Dediyapada in Narmada district.
 
 “Police traced the woman’s family and it is a good initiative by them. Usha’s mental condition may improve by living with her family,” said  , superintendent, WSH, Surat.
 
 “We had one clue of her address which was Ankleshwar and we thought to give it a try. I contacted my colleagues in Bharuch district and they were able to trace the family. We are happy that we could unite Usha with her family,” said ACP Patel.
 
 “Our SOG team did good work and with just the name of Ankleshwar, we were able to trace her family. It feels good for the work done,” said Sandip Singh, superintendent of police, Bharuch.
