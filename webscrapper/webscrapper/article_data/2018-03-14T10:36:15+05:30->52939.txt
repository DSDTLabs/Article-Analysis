GAYA: Taking note of the ongoing illegal sand mining operations in Barachatti police station area of the district, district magistrate Abhishek Singh has directed the mining department officials to launch a crackdown against sand mafia.

 Confirming the DM’s directive, district mining officer Manoj Ambastha said the department was aware of the illegal activities of sand mining in Barachatti police station area and quarrying in prohibited   river. Ambastha said that two vehicles laden with illegally mined sand were seized on Tuesday. Claiming that the department has never been lax in reining in the culprits, the official said raids were conducted and eight trucks and one tractor loaded with sand were seized in the recent past.
 
 Asked about reports that the local police was hand- in-glove with the sand mafia, Ambastha said he cannot say anything in this matter. “Many officers including the area DSP have been very cooperative. The department works in coordination with the police,” he added.
 
 Sources said that vehicles clandestinely carrying sand are invariably overloaded. These overloaded trucks also cause considerable damage to roads. Earlier, SSP Garima Malik said if involvement of the local police in illegal sand mining comes to light, punishment would be meted out to the wrong doing cop.
