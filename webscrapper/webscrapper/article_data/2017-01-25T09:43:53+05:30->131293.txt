 The university has been without a vice-chancellor since January 2016, when R Thandavan was relieved. The convocation, scheduled in December, was cancelled as syndicate members objected to the function without a VC. 
 
 The three-member search panel consists of PN Veda Narayanan, a retired vigilance commissioner, Dr R Balasubramanian, a faculty in SRM University and R Surendira Prasad, a former syndicate member of UNOM.
