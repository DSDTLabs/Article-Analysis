MUMBAI: Almost a couple of months after the Indian team thrashed   by an innings and 36 runs at the   to clinch the Test series, their juniors did an encore at the same venue, blasting out their English counter parts, who looked completely listless, by a massive 230-run margin to pocket the one-day series.

 Riding on magnificent hundreds by   (160, 120b, 23x4, 1x6), who slammed his second ton on the trot, and   (105, 89b, 12x4, 2x6), and their 231-run stand for the second wicket in 164 balls, the   team put up 382 for nine in 50 overs -their second highest total at this level -after being asked to bat.
 
 In fact, at one point, Gill and Shaw even looked like taking the India U-19 team to its biggest oneday total ever -4253 against Scotland in Dhaka in 2004, before both were dismissed in the early part of slog overs.
 
 They then produced a clinical performance with the ball too, needing merely 37.4 overs to fold up England for 152, to complete a gigantic win, with seamers   (4-31) and   (3-20) doing the maximum damage.
 
 Coming off an unbeaten 138 in the previous game, the in-form Gill began his assault with a beautiful on-drive for four off Matt Fisher on just the second ball of the match, and kept punching boundaries all over the park. The Punjab batsman hits the ball hard, particularly when he executes the short-arm pull to smash the ball in the mid wicket region.
 
 The final game of this series, scheduled for Wednesday here, is now just a mere formality.India Under-19s: 3829 (Gill 160, Shaw 105, Brookes 2-58) beat England Under-19s 152 (Pope 59, Jacks 44, Nagarkoti 4-31) by 230 runs.
