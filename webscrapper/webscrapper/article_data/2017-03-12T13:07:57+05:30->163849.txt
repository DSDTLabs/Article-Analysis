PATNA: Falling on Monday this year,   will have an extended four-day holiday in  . However, bankers claim to have already taken measures to ensure that customers do not face cash crunch during the festivities.

 The banks will remain shut on March 11 and March 12, which are second Saturday and Sunday. March 13 and March 14 are Holi holidays.
 
 “We have decided to allow limited loading of cash in our ATMs even on March 11 and March 14. That will ensure supply of cash to our customers, sufficient to last two days,” State Bank of India’s chief manager (ATM operations) Minisha Anand said, adding her bank would also take steps to ensure repair of technical snags, if any, in its ATMs even as the bank’s branches would have their shutters down during the four days.
 
 However, Allahabad Bank’s senior manager A K L Das said they had not received any communication from their authorities concerned to organise refills for ATMs during the holidays. “As of now, we are preparing to fill our ATMs to the full before leaving our banks for four days,” he said.
 
 The   has outsourced the job to refill its ATMs. “The agency generally inform us of the fluctuations in the holdings, and we make the cash available. However, this will not be possible during the four-day holiday as the bank branches will remain closed,” IDBI’s operations manager Brajesh Kumar said.
 
 The IDBI official, however, added the bank’s customers didn’t need to worry as the ATMs would have enough cash to facilitate drawals even during the holidays.
 
 Other private banks also said their ATMs would be prepped to prevent inconvenience to customers during the holidays. “Rest assured, no one will face any cash crunch when we will be away from our banks to celebrate the festival of colours,” said an   spokesman.
