NEW DELHI: With intelligence inputs repeatedly pointing to plans by terrorist outfits to stage a ‘spectacular’ attack on asecurity installation in  , home minister   has stressed on the need for  , central paramilitary forces and J&K police to ensure foolproof perimeter security of their respective camps in the state.

 “During the security review taken by Singh in Srinagar, which was attended by top commanders of the Army, CRPF and BSF as well as J&K police brass, possibility of stepped up attempts by terrorist outfits like Lashker-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad to avenge the recent reverses, including killing of their top leaders, were discussed. The Army and paramilitary heads were asked to ensure that their camps had breach-proof perimeter security with 24x7 surveillance, proper lighting and intact fencing. This, it was stressed, was an important lesson to be learnt from the previous attacks in Pathankot and Uri, where the terrorists could gain access to the camp due to gaps in perimeter security,” a home ministry officer said.
 
 Another key point repeatedly emphasised by the home minister at the daily security review meetings he chairs is the need for Army, paramilitary forces and J&K police to ensure that guards posted at the entrance to their camps and along the perimeter do not break from duty without having a back-up in place.
 
 “The message is clear. Even toilet breaks must not be taken without having another man in place,” the officer said, recalling what Singh had told officers at the security review in Srinagar.
 
 A couple of days ago, four terrorists were neutralised in a joint cordon and search operation in Uri. J&K police said the terrorists had planned an attack on the lines of last year’s strike at an Army base in the area, in which 19 soldiers were killed.
