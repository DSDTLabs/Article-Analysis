MANGALURU: Former Union minister B Janardhana   said he would felicitate former chief minister B S   if he provides documents to prove his allegations against chief minister Siddaramaiah that he gave money to the Congress high command to retain his seat. 

 “Let Yeddyurappa show documents to prove his allegations that the CM gave Rs 1,000 to the high command. I will personally meet him and garland him,” Poojary said.
 
 The veteran Congress leader ridiculing Yeddyurappa said that the former chief minister does not know what he is speaking. “You are a former CM and you should make sensible remarks. You don’t know what you are speaking. The media has already declared that you are the most corrupt politician of the state,” Poojary lambasted. 
 
 Further, continuing his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Poojary said, “Modi should apologize to the the people of the nation for not keeping his poll promises.”
 
 Referring to BJP’s poll promises, Poojary said that the Modi government has failed in arresting terrorists Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed. “Before election, you (Modi) had said that the BJP government will teach a lesson to Pakistan, which is playing with the lives of Indians. You also attacked Congress saying that it failed to arrest Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed. Now you are in power and arrest them if you can or seek apology from the people, especially the Congress.
