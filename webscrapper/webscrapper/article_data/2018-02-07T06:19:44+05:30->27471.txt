KOLKATA: Author-in-exile   Nasrin has criticised Bangladesh tourism and civil aviation minister AKM Shahjahan Kamal for his bid to showcase   as an   tourist city.

 Kamal plans to showcase Dhaka to representatives of 57 countries who are in the Bangladesh capital for the meet of   Ministers. He had said on Sund-ay he would showcase Bangladesh’s Islamic heritage to Muslim countries across the globe, which infuriated Taslima, who lives in Delhi.
 
 The author said Bangladesh had a secular history as it was formed after fighting the Islamic state of Pakistan, addindg that Dhaka had always been a secular city and had no major history of Islamic heritage. “The minister may have said this for commercial gains. But it is impractical. A major section of the Muslim population are converts from other religions. So, it is unwise to try to portray Dhaka as an Islamic heritage city, which is an attempt to deprive it of its Bengali culture.”
 
 “Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries are known for Islamic heritage and people from across the globe visit   and Medina but no one visits Dhaka for this purpose,” she said.
 
 She added: “While Bangladesh PM   is trying to show a secular face and has brought back the secular constitution, her minister is saying something contrary. How can the PM tolerate him?”
 
 Taslima posted similar comments on Facebook. 
 
 “Islamic terrori-sm is on the rise in Bangladesh, which is a cause for concern for the Hasina government. There is rising intolerance against minorities. Such   will fan terrorism,” she said.
