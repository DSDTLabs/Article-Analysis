MANGALURU: The statement by Ivan D’Souza, chief whip of the government in state legislative council that PM   must be sent to jail for his  , has been described as heights of foolishness by  . 

 Ivan should first understand that 90% of people have supported the move by the PM to demonetize 86% high value currency of the face value Rs 500 and Rs 1000 in circulation across India as on November 8, he said.
 
 Assailing Ivan’s statement, Srinivas Poojary said when nations such as Russia, North Korea, Myanmar carried out a similar exercise, people of these countries had expressed their lack of confidence in their leadership that took such a decision. Such remarks belittling the post of a PM only shows Ivan in poor light, he said reminding Ivan that people have accepted Modi’s decision that has effectively stopped all Congress backed violence in the Kashmir valley.
 
 It is imperative that no one politicizes issues concerning economy and defence of the country and this has been time tested tradition in the country, Srinivas Poojary said adding PMs move on demonetization is a surgical strike on forces that are inimical to nation’s economic progress. 
 
 Just as the cross border surgical strike on terror launch pads, this move is seen as a surgical strike on the black money economy that was flourishing in India, the former minister noted.
