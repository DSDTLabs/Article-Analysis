AHMEDABAD:   on Friday cleared the way for Bollywood singer   who can now sing all of her popular songs at the concert scheduled on Sunday. The HC has set aside the lower court’s stay order on singing certain copyrighted songs at the concert.

 A bench of Chief Justice R S   and Justice V M   suspended the commercial court’s decision to grant and extend interim stay on Ghoshal’s singing of songs, which are copyrighted by music company   for Yashraj Films and Zee Music. The music company had moved the commercial court against the organizers of the event, Coconut Media Box, for not having obtained licence to play or perform the copyrighted songs.
 
 While setting aside the stay order, the HC asked Coconut Media to file an undertaking before the commercial court by February 28 that it would pay licence fee in case commercial court rules in favour of Novax.
