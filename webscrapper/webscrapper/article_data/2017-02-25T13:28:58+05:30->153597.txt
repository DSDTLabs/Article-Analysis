PATNA: Five weeks after 24 people met watery grave in the Ganga while returning from a Bihar Tourism-sposnored kite festival in the riverine area across the river in Patna on  , the state government on Friday suspended an SDPO and transferred two IAS officials, one IPS officer and several   officials.
 
  The government move follows an inquiry report which blamed the tourism department and the Patna and Saran officials for the  .
  
  Sonepur SDPO   has been suspended for alleged callousness in crowd management, said a government notification.
  
  According to another notification, principal secretary (tourism)   has been transferred to the mines and geology department in the same capacity while Bihar State Tourism development Corporation MD Umashankar Prasad has been shifted to the animal husbandry and fisheries department as joint secretary.
  
  Saran SP Pankaj Kumar Raj has been transferred and asked to report to the HQ and wait for posting. Patna district administration’s magistrate (city) Manzoor Alam and magistrate (law and order) Rajesh Choudhary have also been relieved and asked to wait for posting.
  
  Sources said the inquiry report of principal secretary (disaster management) Pratyaya Amrit and DIG (central range)   stated many officials assigned kite festival arrangements did not report for duty. “Many officials are being suspended, many others are being transferred and yet others will face departmental proceedings,” said a senior official, preferring anonymity.
  
  The tragedy took place around 5.30pm on January 14 when an overcrowded country boat with around 60 persons on board capsized in the Ganga, just 50 metres away from the Sabbalpur Diara sandbar. The probe report has regretted that advertisements were issued in newspapers to invite people to the kite festival, but adequate arrangements were not made for sailing them back home.
