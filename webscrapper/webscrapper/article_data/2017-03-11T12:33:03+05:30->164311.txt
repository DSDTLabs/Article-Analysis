Men who take drugs to treat hair loss or an enlarged prostate may experience  , and the problem can persist long after they stop taking the medication, a new study has warned.

 Men with longer exposure to the drugs finasteride and dutasteride had a higher risk of getting persistent erectile dysfunction than those with less exposure, researchers from Northwestern University in the US said. The persistent erectile dysfunction continued despite stopping these drugs, in some cases for months or years.
 
 Among young men, prolonged exposure to the drugs posed a greater risk of persistent erectile dysfunction (PED) than all other assessed risk factors.
 
 This means there is a stronger relationship between taking these drugs and having PED than having diabetes, hypertension or smoking, which are other risk factors. Erectile dysfunction is difficulty achieving and maintaining a sufficient erection to have sex. Persistent erectile dysfunction continued despite stopping the drug and continued despite taking sildenafil (Viagra) or similar drug.
