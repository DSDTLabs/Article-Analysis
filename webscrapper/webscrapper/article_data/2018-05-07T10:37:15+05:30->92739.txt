JALANDHAR: The   (SP) joined the clamour for waiving the goods and services tax (GST) on langar served at Golden Temple in Amritsar on Sunday.

 SP leader Balwant Singh Ramoowalia said at a press conference here on Sunday that if Prime Minister   had ever partaken in langar, he would know it was served for free. “The PM should realise it is a tradition for Sikhs, and the entire nation is proud of this tradition of the community.   has stayed in Punjab and should know this,” he said.
 
 He said the Centre was bearing a monthly loss of Rs 250 crore just to keep Air India afloat, while GST paid by   would be just Rs 9 crore. “Is it really that hard for the Centre to announce the waiver,” he said.
 
 Ramoowalia said even the Mughals did not tax langar. “Akbar even donated 12 and a half villages to the third Sikh master,  , after he was impressed with the community’s tradition of serving free food and its concept of equality,” he said.
 
 Ramoowalia also attacked his former party, the SAD, saying it was much weaker now as it had failed to convince the PM for a GST waiver on langar.
