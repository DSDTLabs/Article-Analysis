 says he and his 'The Lost City of Z' co-star Robert   could not bond on the sets of the film while shooting as much as he would have liked. The 36-year-old actor reveals he often felt the 'Twilight' star did not like him. 

  
  
 "I wanted these relationships to evolve naturally on screen, through the work. I don't think I said more than ten words to Robert off camera."
 
 "I didn't know if he was just 'in that zone' or if he genuinely didn't like me. There was a real distance between us," Hunnam said. 
 
 But the 'Sons of Anarchy' actor adds that Pattinson started to make an effort to bond after the shoot was done. "He's reached out to me subsequently, making overtures for us to be friends now. So I think it was about the work," he says.
