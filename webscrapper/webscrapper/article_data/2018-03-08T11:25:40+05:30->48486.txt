COIMBATORE: Several political parties came together here on Wednesday to voice their protest against   leader H   for his controversial comments on social reformer EVR Periyar’s statues.

 About 60 advocates gathered outside the court complex and raised slogans against Raja. Dravida Kazhagam cadres conducted a demonstration against Raja and BJP at Sundarapuram. Police detained about 25 Makkal Kalai Ilakiya Kazhagam members, who conducted a protest outside the south taluk office and tried to burn photographs of Raja. As many as 49 Social Democratic Party of India members, who tried to burn the photographs of the BJP leader, were arrested from the Ukkadam Bus Stand on the Sungam Bypass.
 
  party cadres staged protests across 11 locations in the city. Pongalur N Palanisamy and 80 cadres were detained for staging a protest at DMK’s Gandhipuram office.
 
 “Totally, 525 people, including 22 women, were detained for conducting protests at various parts of the city,” a police officer said.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP leader and former member of Parliament CP Radhakrishnan condemned the attack on the party office and requested the cadre to maintain law and order. “We will co-operate with the police. We request the state government not only arrest those who hurled bombs at the office, but also the brain behind the entire incident,” he said.
 
 Talking about Raja’s comments on demolition of statues of Periyar and Lenin, Radhakrishnan said ideologies should be fought with discussion and not with violence. “We condemn all forms of violence even if our party members are involved in it. We have asked the cadre to maintain peace and maintain law and order,” he said.
