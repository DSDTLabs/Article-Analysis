Panaji: MPT has invested in state-of-art-the dust-control measures, MPT deputy chairman GP Rai said. Pointing out that MPT was one of the oldest ports in the country, he said it started handling coal in the 1990s using conventional methods. “Now we have state-of-the-art facilities for handling coal. We have invested a lot in monitoring equipment and even formed a separate cell for environment monitoring,” he said. Elaborating on dust control measures taken up at berths 6 and 7, MP executive engineer DD Ambe said that once cargo is dumped in hoppers (a container for a loose bulk material, which tapers downward to discharge its contents at the bottom), an aqua system is activated. “Water used is recycled water from the port’s sewage treatment plant. Coal moves through closed conveyor galleries, coal stacks are covered with tarpaulin sheets and road sweeping machines suck up dust. Coal loaded onto trucks is sprinkled with water and the wheels of trucks are washed too. The roads have been concretized,” Ambe said.
