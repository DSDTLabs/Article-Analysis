NAGPUR: Twenty volunteers of two NGOs formed a   around   to protest against dumping of waste. Members of King Cobra Organization Youth Force and   came out against the negligent attitude of the authorities which has put ecosystem of the   in jeopardy. 

 According to president of the youth force Arvind Ratodi, the lake is being polluted for over 20 years. Things got worse when waste from nearby   police station was being dumped into the lake shortly after its construction began a few days ago. “With huge amounts of waste being dumped into the lake, the marine life was severely affected. This lake housed several turtles and fish most of which have now died,” he said.
 
 Ratodi told TOI that he has taken permission from the office of the district collector and public works department to stop construction. However, there have been instances when people continue to throw waste into the lake, he said. The campaign will make people aware of the repercussions of their action. We got support of the authorities but people are still largely unconcerned which we want to change,” said Ratodi.
 
 Bhushan Pujari, a volunteer, said, “It is shameful to see such treatment being meted out to animals. This lake is important in terms of marine population. Over 70% of the fish have died in the lake. Many turtles have either gone missing or lost lives. Moreover, water snakes come out of the lake as a result of pollution and enter nearby houses, which is dangerous.”
 
 “It is important to sensitize people about this issue. We often blame our authorities for not taking action, but cases like this show how people continue act in the same way even after strict action taken by the authorities,” said Aniket Surushe, a volunteer.
