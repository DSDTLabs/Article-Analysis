 CHANDIGARH: Employees of GMCH-16 including nurses and other hospital staff staged a protest at the hospital premises demanding a cancellation of the auctioning of   canteen contract which offers food to patients at subsidized rates. 
 
 The protest started at 11 am and continued till 12:30 pm. A joint action committee comprising nurses, cleaners, lab technicians and other employees staged the protest.
 
 The protest had been going on for two days but it took a vital turn today when around 250 employees rallied within the hospital premises striking spoons against steel plates and demanding the cancellation of the auction.
 
 The Red Cross canteen provides food at subsidized rate where a thali costs Rs 20. Protestants alleged that the prices will rise up to Rs 60-70 per thali if the canteen is auctioned. This will be of major inconvenience to both patients and the hospital staff who often eat at the canteen. The auction of the canteen is scheduled to be held from May 31 by the Indian  .
 
 "A 10-15% increase in prices is acceptable, but a sudden 200% increase will not be tolerated. Such a huge increase in price will put an unnecessary burden on the patient. They should think about the welfare of the patient before taking such a drastic step," said Shobhna, one of the protesters.When asked if the patients are the main sufferers of this protest, the protestors said that full care is being taken to ensure that none of patients suffer due to the protest. 
 
 "We're organizing this protest for the welfare of the patients. As a matter of fact, we take turns protesting to ensure that nurses are available in all wards," said a member of the nurse's union.
