Curchorem/Quepem: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, at an election campaign meeting at Curchorem, on Saturday, stressed that no project will be imposed on the people without their consent, if   was voted to power in the state.

 Kejriwal was referring to the proposed coal-handling project at Assolda, which the panchayat has challenged in the National Green Tribunal (NGT).
 
 Noting the opposition to the Cacora garbage treatment plant, he said it will be moved to an uninhabited area if his party came to power in the state. Stating that the huge project cost was a waste of funds, he said, “It’s clear there is corruption here as well.” 
 
 The Delhi CM further assured to complete the mining bypass from Uguem to Kapxem, the foundation stone for which was laid by the BJP government in 2012, and later abandoned following the mining ban. 
 
 Setting up mohalla clinics in all villages, improving the standards of government schools, action against perpetrators of illegal mining, were some of the assurances dished out by Kejriwal at the meeting. 
 
 Curchorem candidate James Fernandes hit out at   for supporting the plants at Curchorem and Assolda. Neither project will be allowed, Fernandes vowed. 
 
 In Quepem, Kejriwal said that his party would initiate measures to curb corruption in projects that were eating into the public exchequer to the detriment of people.
 
 Speaking at a public meeting at the Sanguem bus stand on Saturday evening, he alleged that the cost of the Mandovi bridge, estimated to cost roughly Rs400 crore, had gone up to Rs800 crore and added that because ministers grab a share of project funds, project costs were inflating.
 
 In Delhi, AAP had reduced the cost of a major bridge from Rs 350 crore to Rs 250 crore and saved Rs 100 crore in an effort to curb corruption and kick backs, he said.
