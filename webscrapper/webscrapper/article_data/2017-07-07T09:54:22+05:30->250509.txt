NEW DELHI: It was the sight of an out-of-breath coach that prompted the   to launch a fitness audit of coaches in the country. More than one thousand coaches are currently undergoing a fitness and aptitude audit, a first of its kind initiative. "When we are talking about producing world-class sportspersons, coaches become important tools. The audit will ensure that we can provide the best coaches to our sportspersons," said sports minister  .

 Not surprisingly, the move hasn't gone down well with the coaching community. While no one is willing to talk out loud, the fitness audit has ruffled feathers, with many cautiously commenting about the lack of age limit for federation heads and other administrative posts. It's a point that Goel dismisses, pointing out that federations are autonomous. "However, ensuring that we have fighting-fit coaches is under the purview of the ministry," said Goel, citing recent efforts to hire international coaches as well as the missive to international and national athletes to take up coaching.
 
 The fitness audit of coaches in the system is one such initiative, insists  . Of the 1,200 coaches identified for the audit those who were hired in the past two years have been left out of the ambit half have already undergone the tests. This includes fitness tests that checks physical capabilities like running and flexibility as well as an aptitude test. Said a senior government official, "The   periodically, but they have to also keep abreast of the latest in their domain. Whether they have updated their knowledge is tested in this module."
 
 What is however, irking most coaches is the ministry's decision to come up with a list of all those who fail the audit. Said a sports ministry official, "Those who cannot meet the parameters of the tests or don't fulfil the minimum criteria will be asked to retire."
