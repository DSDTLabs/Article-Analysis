The 25 years of RAW celebration kicked off with Stephanie McMahon and Shane McMahon thanking the   universe for their support and extended their greetings to each and every performer who stepped inside the squared ring during RAW historic run. But Vince McMahon, the Chairman of the company was not in a grateful mood as he bad-mouthed the Brooklyn, New York crowd claiming not but him deserves the credit for this celebration.
