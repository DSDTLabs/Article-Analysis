KANYAKUMARI: As many as 263 people, including 102 women, were arrested on Wednesday as Arasu Rubber Corporation Limited (ARCL) workers picketed the collectorate in Nagercoil, calling attention to their long-pending demand for a wage hike.

 The pickets, about 600 of them, blocked the road near the collectorate, throwing traffic out of gear for a while. The agitators complained that they had wage-related concerns to be addressed but the government has neen turning a blind eye to it.
 
 Over 1,300 employees working in the Keeriparai, Manalodai, Chithar, Mylar and Kodayar divisions of ARCL in Kanyakumari district, have to make do with a meager daily wage of Rs 420, which peters out on off-season as most go jobless then, they said.
