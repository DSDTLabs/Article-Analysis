NEW DELHI:  , Bangalore remains India's mainstay in the global university rankings. For the second time, IISc has been featured in the top 100 of the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, being clubbed between 91-100 ranks. The institute was clubbed in the same group in 2011 and since then has been out of the top 100 list. 

 
  There has been no change in the top four from that of last year's list led by  , Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University, all from the US in the order of first, second and third respectively, followed by   from the UK. University of Cambridge which was in joint fourth place last year dropped a place in the latest rankings, released on Wednesday. 
 
 The annual list, compiled from a globally representative survey of more than 10,000 senior academics, highlights the top 100 most   brands. The US continues to dominate, with Harvard University taking the top spot for the eighth consecutive year, and 43 other US institutions making the top 100. 
 
 India features in the table for the first time since 2011, with the IISc, making the 91-100 banding. On this year's performance, THE's Editorial Director of Global Rankings Phil Baty, said: "This new data from more than 10,000 leading scholars across the world demonstrates that the US remains the global higher education superpower by a long, long way - it claims close to half of the world's top 100 university brand names.
 
 "What is particularly striking is that the US has actually strengthened its position in the world, with more top 100 institutions and top institutions moving up the rankings this year - despite fears that the US is suffering a 'Trump slump' in terms of its global reputation. While we have seen evidence that some international students are seeing the US as a less attractive option, with declining applications, this data from the global academic community suggests the top US universities remain the most highly regarded in the world by a mile."
