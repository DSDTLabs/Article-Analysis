 Recently, the first look motion poster of ‘Saamy Square’ got a good response from the audience and clocked in more than 3 million views on YouTube.

 Reportedly, ‘Saamy Square’ is not a sequel but a spin-off of the first part, which will have   playing the prime antagonist. The film stars Keerthy Suresh, John Vijay, Prabhu and Soori among others.
