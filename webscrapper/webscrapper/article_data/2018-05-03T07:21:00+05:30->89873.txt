Amritsar: The US-based rights body,   (SFJ), has threatened Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa over his strong opposition to its brainchild ‘Referendum 2020’ aimed at an independent Sikh state of Khalistan.

 Attorney at law of the SFJ Gurpatwant Singh Pannun tweeted on Wednesday, “Respond to Punjab jail minister — will you come to Canada or should we handle you in India.”
 
 “The people who were pitching for Khalistan from their cosy confines were playing with the sentiments of gullible Sikhs in India and they had zilch knowledge of the reality in Punjab,” Randhawa told TOI, when asked for his response to Pannun’s tweet. He said why Canada, he was ready to go anywhere in the world to accept the challenge of Khalistan. “The demand is not coming from Indian Sikhs but from the Sikhs living abroad,” said Randhawa, while advising the separatists to make Khalistan in the country they were presently living in. He further said Pannun had reacted to his strong opposition of ‘Referendum 2020’.
 
 “The SFJ has threatened an elected representative of India and I will take up the issue with chief minister Amarinder Singh, urging him to further raise the issue with the Centre to convey the threat to one of his minister to the US government through a diplomatic channel,” said Randhawa. While questioning Pannun’s Sikh credentials, he said he was a ‘patit’ (apostate) Sikh and was fanning separatist forces.
 
 This is probably the first strong statement by Khalistani elements settled in the US and Canada after the alleged cold treatment to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by the Indian government during his recent visit to India. It not only isolated the Sikh hardliners but also cautioned the Canadian government against its support to such fringe elements who had nothing to lose living outside India but had the potential to cause massive damage.
