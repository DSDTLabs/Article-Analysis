INDORE: Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Thursday congratulated the people of Indore after the city emerged on the top of the list of India’s cleanest cities. She said the feat was achieved only after residents actively backed the cleanliness drive launched by Indore Municipal Corporation.

 “The news makes me proud and gives me immense relief. I congratulate the people of Indore for the city being declared the cleanest one in the country in Swachhata Sarvekshan 2017,” Mahajan said in a statement.
 
 “I have been witness to the change in Indore for the last several decades. The city is growing fast and changing but the people of the city have upheld social coordination, the city’s culture and its ideology,” she said.
 
 “The people of the city have contributed a lot to ensure that the drives launched by IMC bore fruit. People of Indore are aware and love their city, thus the campaign started to make the city clean has yielded positive results. Indore is also called the ‘city of taste’. People have a fascination for food. But when it comes to implementing positive work and ensuring cleanliness, the attitude of residents of this foodie city is commendable,” the eight-time MP said.
 
 “People of Indore are not dependent solely on IMC for cleanliness. Each one has contributed in keeping the city clean. Whenever the corporation has sought help, people have extended their assistance. Every citizen deserves to be congratulated for the achievement,” she added.
