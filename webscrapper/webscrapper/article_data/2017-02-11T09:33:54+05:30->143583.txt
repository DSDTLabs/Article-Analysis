VADODARA: Baroda University Teachers Association (BUTA) has decided to initiate a movement to demanding central university status for M S University. 

 A resolution to this effect was adopted during the extraordinary general body meeting on Friday. However, only 22 out of 450 plus teachers, who are members of the association, remained present at the meeting. BUTA also formed a five-member committee to decide the next course of action. “To build a movement, we will be meeting all the stakeholders and associations including teaching, non-teaching and students association,” said BUTA’s general secretary  , adding that discussion meeting with different faculties will be held to build opinion and start a movement. “We will be also urging students association to join us in the movement,” said Patel. 
 
 BUTA said the central university status, MSU’s image will get a major uplift at national and global levels while higher research grant allocations from various national and international funding agencies will also increase. While there will be increased inflow of quality students from within and outside the country for both post graduate and research programmes, MSU’s degrees will also command more respect globally. 
 
 Additionally, this will result in better and increased job prospects with more attractive pay packages for university students and it will significantly decrease financial burden of the state which will be able to redistribute its resources elsewhere.
