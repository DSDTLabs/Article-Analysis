NEW DELHI: Even a decade after the Supreme Court directive to get offices of political parties shifted from Delhi's Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone(LBZ), government data shows that 10 bungalows are still occupied by political parties. While the maximum (4) are occupied by Congress, BJP has two such properties in the heart of the country’s capital. 

 The data submitted by the directorate of estates (DoE) to the   (CIC) said no fresh allotment was made after December 2010 when 4, Gurudwara Rakabganj Road was allotted to Bahujan Samaj Party. The government decision to amalgamate three neighbouring bungalows into one and allot it to BSP had kicked up a political storm during UPA-2. 
 
 The other parties occupying bungalows are Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party and Communist Party of India. According to details available on DoE’s website, a total of 27 suites —18 single and nine double suites —in VP House have been allotted to political parties. BJP and Congress occupy eight suites each. Janata Dal (United) has two suites while RJD, AIADMK, Shiv Sena, SAD, RLD, DMK, Janata Dal (S) and AAP occupy one each. 
 
 Following an SC order, all political parties were required to vacate properties in the LBZ and were given land in other places to build offices. They were required to give up their bungalows within three years of taking possession of the land. 
 
 While BJP has started building its office on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, Congress is yet to start work to shift its offices out of the LBZ. Congress has sought urban development ministry’s permission to occupy the bungalows for three more years when it expects to complete building its new office.
