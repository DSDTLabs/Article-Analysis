Chennai: City based ride sharing startup Greenpool has raised an undisclosed funding amount from investors including Polaris founder and Intellect Design Arena chairman Arun Jain and former CEO of CTS, Lakshmi Narayanan. Ravikumar Kumarasamy set up Greenpool in 2015 to offer on-demand, peer-to-peer mobile based carpooling. In February this year, Greenpool pivoted to focus on the enterprise route. The startup now offers white labelled enterprise car pooling solutions with dedicated apps for TCS, Wipro and Intellect Design Arena. With over 400 people car pooling on a daily basis using Greenpool, Kumarasamy is looking to launch in Bengaluru by early next month. “Greenpool is an idea behind which there is a passionate leader in Ravikumar and an idea that benefits the environment, safety of commuters, efficiency of transportation and above all keeping vehicles off the road and reduce congestion Ride sharing, in addition offers an experience of meeting new people and develops the ability to be sociable. In course of time, I believe efficiency in transportation will be driven by efficiency in sharing access, much the same way as public transport,” said Lakshmi Narayanan.

 “In the last 3 weeks that we implemented our car pooling solution for an IT major, we have recorded savings worth Rs 118000 and 4.1 tonnes of carbon footprint,” said Kumarasamy.
 
 The 15 member team is looking to have 50 enterprise clients by the end of the year and achieve 100,000 rides a month by the end of the year.
