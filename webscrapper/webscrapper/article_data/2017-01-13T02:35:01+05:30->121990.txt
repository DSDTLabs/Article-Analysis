NEW  : The adverse impact of demonetisation is finally showing in the state’s revenues. After a robust Value Added   collection of Rs 2,023 core in November 2016, which was 15.59% higher than the same period the previous year and more than the monthly average of 10% in 2016, it witnessed negative growth for the first time the current fiscal.

 In December,   collections were Rs 1,687 crore in December, 4% less than Rs 1,757 crore earned last year. This is clearly a setback for the state government that is now watching out for the January collections to see if things have stabilised. The average VAT collection per month in 2016 reflected growth rates of 8-10% over 2015.
 
 While the VAT department has not officially attributed a single reason to the increase in collections in November followed by the fall in December, the impact of demonetisation is evident from steep decline in tax collections from certain specific sectors.
 
 For instance, the auto sector shows that tax from sales of two and three wheelers went down by 31% in December and tax from car sales was even lower at 35%. Tax from sales of mobile phones and electronic goods was also impacted. Tax collection was down by 12% in case of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) like detergents and other non-durable commodities.
 
 The decline in tax from paint, cement, sanitary hardware, steel and iron reflects the slowdown in the construction sector.
 
 When demonetisation was launched on November 8, the state government was concerned that it would impact VAT collections. In November, VAT collected was Rs 2,023 crore. 
 
 A reason for the increase was attributed to more tax being paid between October 21 and November 21.
 
 Since   was on October 30, the pre-Diwali sales also reflected in the November tax cycle. Also, since most traders deposit VAT in the last days of the monthly cycle, tax was paid after demonetisation kicked in. It is also being speculated that traders paid tax after demonetisation by showing pre-dated sales.
 
 January’s tax collections will clear the haze on the impact of demonetisation on VAT collections. The assessment will be significant as Delhi government is just left with the last quarter of the current financial year to meet its target of about Rs 24,000 crore from VAT.
 
 Between April 1 and November 2016, VAT collected was about Rs 14,000 crore as compared to Rs 12,800 crore last year. In financial year 2015-15, Delhi government earned Rs 20,500 crore from VAT.
