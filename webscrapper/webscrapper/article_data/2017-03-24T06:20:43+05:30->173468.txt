ROHTAK: After a delay of over four months, the family of slain   head constable   was finally given Rs 50 lakh compensation by the   government on Thursday. Indora (39) was killed in mortar shelling by Pakistani defence forces in Rajouri sector of Jammu and Kashmir on November 20, 2016.

 He is survived by his wife Sunita and three school-going children, who were facing monetary troubles after losing the sole breadwinner of their family. His wife had lamented that they had to struggle for paying the school fee of their children due to paucity of funds and the delay in release of compensation by government was making the situation worse. The family members of Indora had even resorted to road blockade for announcement of Rs 20 lakh compensation, which was later increased to Rs 50 lakh.
 
 Haryana cooperation minister and   MLA Manish Grover visited Indoraâ€™s family at their native village Kheri Sampla and handed them a cheque of Rs 50 lakh. Talking to newspersons, Grover said the BJP government had increased the ex-gratia for the families of martyred paramilitary forces personnel to Rs 50 lakh from Rs 20 lakh.
