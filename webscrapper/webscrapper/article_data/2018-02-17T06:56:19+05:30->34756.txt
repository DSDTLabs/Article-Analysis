AHMEDABAD:   students made their presence felt in the all-India postgraduate National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (PG-NEET), as more than a dozen doctors from the state ranked in the top 100 of the merit list declared on Friday.

 Rajkot-based Dr   is at the top, ranking number one in India in PG NEET, with a score of 975 out of 1,200 marks.
 
 Rachit, who started preparations for PG-NEET four-years ago, along with his MBBS studies, said that he is extremely happy having achieved the feat but has not yet decided which branch he will choose for his higher studies in medicine. 
 
 Ahmedabad-based Shikha   achieved the eighth rank across India, having scored 880 out of 1,200 marks. “I have qualified to get admission in the top ten colleges in the country. I will choose between radiology, dermatology or gynaecology,” said Shah.
 
 Gujarat boy Keyur Shah stood 27th while Amay Banker, with 850 marks, ranked 30th. “I will opt for surgery. The result has more than a dozen Gujarat students ranking in the top 100 from across India,” said Shah.
 
 Ahmedabad boy Meet Chaudhary ranked 45th, with 840 marks. “In 2017, only four students from Gujarat ranked in the top 100 but this year there are around 15 students who have scored more than 800 out of 1,200. Local students have started giving tough competition in all-India competitive exams,” said Chaudhary.
 
  Desai ranked 50th in the country with 839 marks. Anshumi says that she wants to follow in the footsteps of her mother, breast cancer surgeon Dr  , who was the only woman in her class in 1988 to opt for surgery which was considered a branch for the men.
 
 “My mother chose to tread a difficult path. She is my role model and I have decided to be a breast cancer surgeon like her. I want to contribute in stemming and treating the rising burden of cancer in women in the country,” said Anshumi.
