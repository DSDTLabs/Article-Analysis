KOLKATA: Another man was arrested on Saturday for his alleged involvement with a gang that sold expired drugs as valid over-the-counter medicine. Police said the accused was picked up from the Burrabazar area. 

 “We identified the accused Paltu Hazra (35) from the statements of the two other accused, especially printing press owner Pawan Jhunjhunwala. He is a resident of Janai in Hooghly with a shop on Sukeas Lane. While Pawan erased the manufacturing date and batch details, Paltu reprinted new dates and batch numbers,” said joint commissioner (crime) Vishal Garg.
 
 The police have identified a third company whose executives took active help from this gang to dispose of unsold expired products. “We are preparing a list of the top officials of these companies. They will be interrogated,” said a senior officer. 
 
 “You can say that the two arrested men — Jhunjunwala and wholesaler  , who were arrested on Thursday — were key ground players. The main culprits who ran the show from behind are yet to be arrested,” claimed a source.
 
 Sources in Lalbazar said most of the expired medicines were generic products, sold on 17-30% discount, passing them off as fair price shop items. An officer said cops will seek help from the   traders to weed out such malpractices.
 
 The probe will also look in to the role of pharmacists who hand over unsold expired drugs. “The gang took advantage of lapses in the system,” said a source.
