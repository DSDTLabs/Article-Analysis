 and his younger son   are inseparable. From cricket matches to parties and interviews, the toddler is seen accompanying his superstar dad everywhere. Just like SRK, AbRam is unbelievably charming and brings an instant smile to everyone’s face with his presence.

 The father-son duo was spotted enjoying a long drive on   in Bandra, Mumbai on Monday. As daddy dearest took to the wheel, the little munchkin was thrilled beyond words. AbRam was seen laughing gleefully as he stood in the open-top convertible and waved out at the crowd gathered around.The onlookers naturally couldn’t contain their excitement at the sight of King   and his son. After all, don’t we all love a sighting of Shah Rukh and AbRam together?
