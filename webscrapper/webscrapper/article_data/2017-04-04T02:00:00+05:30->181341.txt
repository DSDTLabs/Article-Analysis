PATNA: The   Petroleum Dealers’ Association on Monday threatened to go on a 12-hour strike and not give fuel to any government vehicle on April 11 in protest against cases of loot at   in the last four months.

 The association members had gone on a token strike by closing petrol pumps for 30 minutes on two days last month in support of their demand for improved security arrangements and action against SHOs for not being able to arrest criminals involved in loot cases. 
 
 “There is no one to pay heed to our plight. We want permanent deployment of two armed police personnel at all petro outlets. If our demands are not fulfilled, we will have to go on an indefinite strike,” said association president Brijendra Kumar  , adding workers of at least 156 outlets in the district would take part in the protest.
 
 According to Sinha, nine petrol pumps have been looted in four months in the district.
