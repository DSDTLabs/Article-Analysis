JALANDHAR: A three-judge appellate panel of the US court of appeals, on September 13, dismissed the Sikhs For Justice ( ) claim against Facebook for blocking in India, its page advocating Punjab Independence Referendum. The judges of appellate court in San Francisco ruled that the social networking company won’t have to face a lawsuit for allegedly blocking access to the SFJ’s page in India because it was immune from liability under Communications Decency Act (CDA).

 “SFJ seeks to hold Facebook liable as a publisher for hosting, and later blocking its online content,” the judges of the appellate court wrote in their order of September 13, copy of which is available with TOI. “Facebook is entitled to immunity for hosting the content as well as for blocking it, because SFJ is solely responsible for creating the material,” the court ruled.
 
 Meanwhile, SFJ legal adviser Gurpatwant Singh Panun said they were seeking advice from expert lawyers in order to take the case against the social media giant to the US Supreme Court.
 
 In the lawsuit filed in 2015, the SFJ had alleged that Facebook had blocked its page in India “for running a campaign against forced conversions of Christians and Muslims to Hinduism through the homecoming; for exposing PM Narendra Modi’s involvement in 2002 massacre of Muslims; for advocating Sikhs’ right to self-determination and demanding independence referendum in the state of Punjab.”
 
 Pannu and other SFJ members were booked for sedition after hoardings of Referendum 2020 were put up at a few places in Punjab. Those were removed later.
