BATHINDA:   from Haryana to Bathinda continues despite police  . Four cases of liquor smuggling were registered on Saturday and police   eight persons, impounded three vehicles and recovered 492 liquor bottles.

 Seven cases of liquor smuggling were registered on April 25. Police recovered 896 bottles and arrested six persons, besides seizing two vehicles.
 
 A case of country-made liquor available in Haryana for about Rs 1,000 costs nearly Rs 2,000 in Punjab. This difference encourages smuggling of liquor from areas of Haryana located close to Punjab, falling in Bathinda, an excise official said.
 
 One case each has been registered at police stations of Maur, Kotfatta, Talwandi Sabo and Sangat. Concerned over unabated liquor smuggling from the neighbouring state, a liquor contractor said smuggling poses a serious threat to the business. If it is not checked, profits will suffer like last year. In such a scenario, he said, liquor contractors may be pushed out of business. 
 
 Bathinda SSP Naveen Singla said police is actively trying to thwart attempts of liquor smuggling and cases are being registered in large numbers due to their vigilance‚Äù.
