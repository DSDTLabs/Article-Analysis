MAPUSA: A day after he stopped work of the greenfield international airport at Mopa, local MGP MLA and tourism minister   ‘Babu’   allowed resumption of work by offering a coconut saying that   airport is needed for Goa and for the country and prayed that the work be completed soon.

 Azgaonkar and his supporters marched to the airport site at Mopa, but this time they offered flowers, coconuts and blessings for the commencement of the work which he had impeded a day earlier.
 
 “We have talked to the company representatives and they assured first preference in employment to locals from the affected villages, the land losers, the people from   and then to Goans. This word given by company officials has been accepted by us. Having faith in their word, we have held back our agitation and allowed commencement of the work,” Azgaonkar said.
 
 “First, there will be employment for 20 locals followed by employment as security guards and as the work progresses, there will be more employment generation for the locals. We need an airport for Goa and for India and I pray to God that the work should be completed soon,” he said.
