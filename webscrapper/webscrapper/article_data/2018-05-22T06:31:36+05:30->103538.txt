PATNA: The   on   was banned from Monday. All trucks and tractors carrying sand and stone aggregates were diverted from zero mile to either Rajendra Setu at Mokama or Ara-Chhapra bridge.

 “In pursuance of a letter issued by the Patna DM’s office on Sunday, heavy trucks carrying sand, stone aggregates and other material have been prohibited on   from Monday,” an order issued by Patna traffic SP PN Mishra stated.
 
 The order further stated that even tractors and medium-weight vehicles would remain prohibited on the bridge from 8 to 11am and 5 to 8pm. Gas and milk tankers would be allowed to ply on the dilapidated bridge from 11pm till 5am. The pontoon bridge parallel to Gandhi setu would remain open round-the-clock for vehicular movement.
 
 Heavy vehicles are already not allowed on the JP Setu rail-cum-road bridge connecting Digha to Sonepur across the Ganga.
 
 All such orders have been issued in pursuance of the decisions taken in a high-level meeting held under the chairmanship of chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh on May 14. It was decided in the meeting to lower vehicular load on Gandhi setu, which has been undergoing rehabilitation since February last as the gap between different spans on its eastern flank was found to have widened.
