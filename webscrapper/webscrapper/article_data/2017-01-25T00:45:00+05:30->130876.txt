Mumbai: Fifty days after   were over, preparation of results has not even started. In fact, preliminary estimates suggest that even 50% answer script evaluation has not been completed. Consequently, there is a delay in results, again.

 The   summoned heads of CAP ( ) centres on Tuesday to get an update on the evaluation work. However, just about 40 of the 200-odd members attended the meeting. While some colleges informed the university that they had completed the assessment and submitted all the data, many others stated that the work was in progress.
 
 “For many institutes, the BCom fifth semester assessment work started after the evaluation of the first year papers ended,” said a faculty member on condition of anonymity. “In fact, this was expected as the design of the examination system is faulty,” said another.
 
 The B Com fifth semester exams ended in November and the results should have been declared by now, but assessment work is still on. 
 
 Meanwhile,   told a a press conference that evaluation of BCom fifth semester answer scripts was almost over. “The corrections are almost over and result will be out in the next eight days. Today was the 50th day since the last exam. I held a meeting. There were small issues that have been taken care of now,” Deshmukh added. 
 
 Principals of colleges and other CAP centre heads said it was impossible to fulfil the VC’s promise and that his claim would fall flat. “According to me, a lot of assessment is still pending and it would not be possible to declare the results in a week,” said a principal. 
 
 It remains to be seen if the VC keeps his word. Students are surely waiting.
