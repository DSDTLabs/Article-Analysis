NEW DELHI: Perhaps it was the cussedness of the passengers on the   he was to have travelled on or of the officials at Delhi University, but   has been left without hope of enrolling himself for the MPhil course this year. The visually impaired Shukla could not sit for the entrance exam on Wednesday after he missed his train at Unnao when the people in the coach reserved for people with disabilities did not open the door for him. Then, having missed the exam,   officials told him there was nothing they could do to help him.

 Sharing his experience on Thursday after finally reaching the capital, Shukla told TOI that he had opted to travel by the   and had accordingly reached Unnao station around 2.15am on Wednesday. The 100% visually impaired youth said, “When the train arrived, we went to the coach reserved for the disabled. It was the one next to the engine. We found the doors locked. My brother and the driver tried to open it.”
 
 The trio even asked the people inside the compartment to open the door. “They looked out from the windows, but no one came forward to help us and the door remained closed,” said the disappointed youth. “It was raining and the stoppage was only for two minutes. We could not make it to the second coach for the disabled at the other end of the train.”
 
 Shukla realised he could not just climb in since the other coaches were very crowded and he could not have managed his way past them. The train left him on the platform, despairing about how he could get to Delhi in time for the entrance test.
 
 Once in Delhi, Shukla told the Delhi University authorities about his plight. “But the DU officials said that they could not do anything now.” A depressed Shukla questioned the logic of placing the two coaches for the disabled at the extreme ends of the train. And ruing his missed opportunity, the aspirant said, “There should have been a guard to open the compartment doors at stations.”
