ATTARI: Indian exports to Pakistan through India’s first integrated check post (ICP) at Attari border in Amritsar have registered a record 30% decline in the 2017-18 financial year as compared to previous year. Traders here blame Pakistan government’s blanket ban on import of vegetables and soybean from India.

 A cross-border trader and Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Commercial Association president Anil   said, “Exporters are left jobless.” He said there was apparently no reason behind Pakistan refusing to import vegetables and soybean except that its government had bowed to the diktats of hardliners who did not want to have any relations with India. “Not only are we suffering but even labourers and transporters are at loss,” said Mehra.
 
 A vegetable exporter from Bathinda, Narinder Sharma said, “We often talk to our importers in Pakistan, but they are also helpless. They are now buying vegetables at much higher prices than they used to while getting goods from India.” He said tomatoes were being sold at around Rs 5 per kg in the wholesale markets in India. “Had Pakistan been importing tomatoes, the domestic price would have been more than Rs 20 per kg in wholesale.” The Indian government should also take retaliatory action so that Pakistani businessmen also feel the heat of their government’s decision, he added.
 
 In 2016-17 financial year, the value of exports to Pakistan via   was Rs 1,063 crore, which dropped to Rs 744 crore in 2017-18. “I cannot comment on the reason for decline of exports to Pakistan through Attari ICP since it is an issue between two countries,” commissioner of customs (preventive)   told TOI.
 
 Giving details of the volume of trade, Attari ICP deputy commissioner   said India had exported vegetables, cotton/yarn, high density polythene (HDPE), soybean and other items amounting to 2.51 lakh tonnen in 2016-17 in Pakistan while there was no trade of vegetables and soybean to the neighbouring country in 2017-18.
 
 Balwinder said overall, they had registered around 30% decline in total exports and around 76% decline in the movement of trucks. He said the Indian imports from Pakistan via ICP registered a minor increase in 2017-18 as compared to the previous year, which also raised the revenue in terms of customs duty. India earned Rs 430.95 crore in customs duty on imports from Pakistan via Attari ICP in 2017-18, up by 77.72% from Rs 242.49 crore in the previous year.
 
 In 2016-17, India had imported goods, including dry fruits, dry dates, cement, soda, glass, gypsum rock/powder, aluminium ore and limestone, valued at Rs 2,907 crore from Pakistan via Attari ICP. The value of imports rose by about 17% to Rs 3,403 crore in 2017-18. However, in 2017-18 there was a minor decline in imports of dry dates, soda, glass, and cement from Pakistan.
 
 Sources said Pakistan had deliberately banned import of Indian perishable goods to dent the Indian economy and cause resentment among the farming community. “As expected, farmers suffered (due to ban). A lot of tomato growers had dumped their produce on roads and staged demonstrations last year. Tomato was otherwise exported to Pakistan via Attari,” they said.
 
 The foundation stone of India’s first ICP at Attari was laid by former Union home minister   on February 20, 2010, and it was later inaugurated by him on April 13, 2012.
