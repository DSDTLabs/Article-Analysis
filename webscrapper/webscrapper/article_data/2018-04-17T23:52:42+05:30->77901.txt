Nagpur: ‘Music under the stars’, a concert of vocal and instrumental  , had the charm of a bygone era. Organized by The   at Shankar Nagar park on Sunday evening, this event was held without any sound system. 

 “Our attempt was not to use any instrument which requires electricity,” said Mandar Pandhare, who conceptualized it. “By holding it in the park where there were noises from all sides we wanted our audience to understand the difference between sound and noise,” he said.
 
 The show was divided into four segments, the first being music for nature, which had the summer season raag Yaman as its theme and was played on flute by Shubham Chopkar. Manasi Joshi and Sayali Kinkekar played the raag on sitar and Shruti Panday, accompanied by Onkar Vaidya, made a vocal presentation. 
 
 The second segment was music for roots featured folk songs, presented by Amandeep Singh Saran, who sang the original version of ‘Dum Dum’ from film Phillauri. Kaushik Biswas sang a Bengali folk song with Parmindar Singh on an instrument called rain stick which is made with mud and gives out the sounds of flowing water.
 
 Music for worship had Gargi Gaikwad singing a fusion of hymns with a song from the film ‘Black’, ‘Haan maine chukar dekha hai’. Much to the delight of senior citizens among the audience, Shreyas Nemad presented ‘Abir gulal’, an abhang originally sung by Pt Bhimsen Joshi. 
 
 Ritesh Kalashetty played the theme song from the film Piku on sitar. The last segment, Music for Hope, had all the artistes singing Nur-e-khuda from the film My Name is Khan. “It was a mesmerizing evening unique in every way,” said writer Sumaiya Sheikh. 
 
 Though apprehensive in the beginning, Shreyas said that his rendition went off very well. “It is every singer’s desire to sing in the open, but here the performances were a mix of many genres and I was not sure how an abhang would gel. But the audience, a mix of young and old, was very receptive,” he said.
