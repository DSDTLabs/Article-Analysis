Kolkata: A city court on Friday did not find enough ‘ground’ to grant custody of   co-owner   and manager   to police. The duo was accused of negligence in the fire that claimed two lives. They were sent to judicial custody for four days. 

 “Section 304 (II) deals with negligence while IPC 308 is for attempt to culpable homicide for which ‘prior knowledge’ is an important criterion. The two are contrary claims,” chief metropolitan magistrate   pointed out to public prosecutor Pijush Kanti Mandal, who sought police custody.
 
 Gujral, who had to plead for himself for the lawyers’ ceasework, pointed out that he delegated the operations, including maintenance, to various department heads. “I am the owner but do not look into daily operations. We had contracted a third party — Magma Security — to look into the hotel’s safety and security. Besides routine check-ups, they conducted a detailed audit on March 28 and 29. Can I be held responsible for the fire? We have even submitted documents to renew the fire license to the fire department and police,” argued Gujral, pleading for his bail. 
 
 Majumdar, on the other hand, claimed he was the manager of nightclub London Pub. “I’ve been shown as the kitchen and store manager. I will plead to the court to go through the   footage and check if I ever stepped into the kitchen. There are five other managers beside me but none was arrested,” he said.
 
 According to sources, police have now turned their attention to the firm that had carried out the audit less than 24 hours before the fire broke out. “We found fire-retardant coating missing from AC ducts. This is a serious lapse. We want to see the documents of the audit that had been carried out hours before the accident. Some more persons are likely to be questioned,” said a senior police officer.
