NEW DELHI: A   has been arrested with 56 rounds of .30 bore that he had procured to eliminate his rivals in  . 

 Pankaj, accused in various cases involving murder, attempt to murder and robbery across east Delhi, is part of the Billa gang that had a long history of rivalry with Kamaljeet Bittu over distribution of cable connections in east Delhi. The police declared a reward on Pankaj, a life convict, who had been absconding since being released on parole. 
 
 “A team tracked down Pankaj with the arms near Shahdara while he was planning to eliminate three rivals within a short time and flee,” said Pramod Kushwah, DCP (Special Cell). Pankaj said he had bought the bullets from a dealer in UP. 
 
 The police arrested Billa last November after he planned to enter a hospital with Pankaj and others dressed as doctors to eliminate Bittu, who was admitted after a shootout in   on October 25. Special Cell was watching the patient and tracking Billa and his gang hiding in   in a rented accommodation. To bump off Bittu, Billa then ordered weapons and aprons on phone.
 
 Billa and Bittu started as partners but became enemies after Billa eloped with the latter’s girlfriend. The October incident caused apprehensions of a gangwar as both groups were involved in several shootouts earlier. On May 31, Billa attacked Bittu’s brother, Charanjeet Singh. This was followed by other shootouts. 
 
 Billa had roped in Pankaj to target Bittu while he was lodged in jail. The police said Pankaj had also planned to target one Neeraj following petty arguments over property deals.
