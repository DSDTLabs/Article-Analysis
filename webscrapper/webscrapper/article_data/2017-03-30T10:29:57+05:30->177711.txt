MARGAO: Citizen-centric administration. That’s what revenue minister   stressed on when he paid a surprise visit to the South Goa collectorate at the   administrative complex, Margao, Wednesday afternoon. 

 Accompanied by South Goa district collector   and additional collector-I Johnson Fernandes, Khaunte went around most of the offices housed in the complex to check on the functioning of the administration. 
 
 Though Khaunte declined to point out any deficiencies , he told mediaperons that the purpose of the visit was to ensure all infrastructural facilities required to roll out various initiatives towards citizen-centric administration were in place. 
 
 E-governance, time-bound delivery of services, digital lockers, land banks, Aadhar-based platforms, were some of the initiatives that will be launched in all offices of the revenue department shortly. 
 
 Apparently pleased with what he observed during his visit, Khaunte said, “The team (South Goa district administration) is quite vibrant.” 
 
 “We are working out various plans and mechanisms to ensure citizen-centric administration in consultation with district collectors,” he added. 
 
 On a query over the alleged irregularities in the Mahiti Ghars, Khaunte admitted that those centres have become “vulture’s dens” thereby indicating large-scale corruption, and stressed the need for the government to work out a solution.
