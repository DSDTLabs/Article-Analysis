What have we not done to get that perfect selfie, right? We have spent thousands on hair colours, tried all kinds of contouring to highlight the cheekbones and downloaded like a million filters. But guess what, there was no need for all that. Because, the   selfie comes without a price tag and is absolutely dreamy. All you have to do is strategically position your face so a ray of refracted sunlight falls on your face, lighting it up with all the seven hues. Sounds mesmerising? Looks that way too. But to nail it, you need to get your basic physics right. You know, the chapter on  ? Ok, we are kidding. Just use a mirror,  , or a CD to bounce sunlight off on to your face, creating a technicolour effect. And then, just hit click. Also, donâ€™t forget to add the #nomakeup and #nofilter hashtags while instagramming them.
