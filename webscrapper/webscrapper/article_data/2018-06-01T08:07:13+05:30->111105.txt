CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court has issued notice to Haryana minister  , asking him to respond to a plea filed by the Karnal district elementary education officer (DEEO), whom the minister had threatened to suspend in a district grievance redress committee meeting held on May 24.

 The minister and science teacher Raj Kumar of Karnal district, who had complaint against the DEEO during the meeting, have been asked to file their replies by Friday. Justice Rajiv Narain Raina passed these orders on Wednesday while hearing the plea filed by DEEO Saroj Bala and one more employee working as an assistant in her office. In her petition filed through advocate Sunil Nehra, the education officer told the HC that Raj Kumar was working as science teacher and an active member of the ruling party of Haryana. It was also stated that the teacher was in habit of making unnecessary complaints against his superiors.
 
 Nehra further added that the teacher was having some grievances related to release of his LTC and had complaint against DEEO in the district grievance committee meeting headed by labour and employment minister Naib Singh Saini on May 24 even though his grouse had been addressed by the DEEO in February.
 
 According to the petitioner, Saini on receiving complaint from the teacher recommended her suspension. She also produced an audio CD containing the recording of proceedings of the meeting in which the minister ordered her suspension before the HC.
 
 Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the minister was not the competent authority to inflict punishment upon her as only the additional chief secretary (education) to government of Haryana had such powers. The petitioner has sought directions to quash the recommendations of the district grievance committee, Karnal, in which the minister had passed orders without any authority.
