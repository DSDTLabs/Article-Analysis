A ladies’ club in the city recently organised a bash with a theme of ‘Party @ the Palace’. The do was organised at a rooftop restaurant and all the members ensured their presence. Kanchan and   played the perfect hostesses.

  (L-R) Shikha, Priyanka and Sakshi, Robby and Shruti (L) and   (BCCL/ IB Singh) 
 
 The venue was beautifully decorated with huge mirror frames. The guests were given Victorian style umbrellas as   props. We spotted Tanvi, Charu, Monica, Preety, Rimple, Palak and Shikha having a good time during the party. Heya looked stylish in a red dress. A red feather hat sported by her also complemented her look.
 The do turned out to be an entertaining one with some singing and dancing performances by the ladies. Shruti and Teena were the first ones to get on the dance floor and were soon joined by Shammi and Robby. Also present during the party were Shivangini, Shalu, Swati and Poonam.
