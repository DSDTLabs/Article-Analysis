Chandigarh: The Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) found safety and hygiene to be the biggest casualty at two government-run crèches and an anganwadi centre it inspected on Wednesday.

 Members of the panel carried out their first check at Government Anganwadi Centre, Sector 56, and found staff to be giving medicines to children without a doctor’s prescription. That’s not all. Doors of all washrooms were found broken, carpets meant for children were in tatters, there was no complaints’ box, and contractual staff had not been verified by the police, said a CCPCR member.
 
 The authorities were to put things in order and asked the officer concerned to monitor the centre every week. The commission later visited government crèche in sectors 39 and 40. Here, panel members yet again found that the carpets meant for children were torn. “During the check, wet clothes and carpets had been left dry on a swing. Recreational facilities are only for children, not for such purposes,” said Harjinder Kaur, the commission’s chairperson.
 
 Windows at the crèche were broken. In Sector 39, no safety grill had been installed on windows. The commission called this a serious lapse and said it could endanger the children’s lives.
