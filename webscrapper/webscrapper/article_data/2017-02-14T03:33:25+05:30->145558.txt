NOIDA: A school in Noida has launched a mobile application—Vaakya—for the disabled. The app is a picture-based one for the speech impaired and can be downloaded from Google Play Store, free of cost. The school has also put in place an e-commerce portal that sells hand-made products made by the special children of the institute.

 Speaking about this initiative, the director of the school said, “With this app, our mission is to give the specially abled a tool to communicate effectively and make them independent and self-reliant.”
 
 The app is aimed at those who are speech impaired, affected by autism, cerebral palsy and various other mental and physical disabilities. It is an augmentative and alternative communication tool and can also be used during rehabilitation. The app creates a combination of custom images and phrases, which can be related to an individual user in order to effectively communicate.
