HYDERABAD:   portal   said on Thursday it was pulling down advertisements on rooster sales, a day after TOI reported how Hyderabadis are doing brisk business online ahead of the   on Sankranti.

 The birds were on sale in ‘pets’ section of the website, at prices ranging from Rs 800 to Rs 1.8 lakh, in violation of a Supreme Court order, banning cock fighting.
 
 Responding to a petition against rooster sales by The Humane Society International, India, OLX’s legal team said,”As soon as we got to know about the order, we proactively deployed technical filters to prevent advertisements relating to sale of roosters from going live on our platform. Our content quality team continues to comb the site for any breach of the filters.”
 
 OlX also appealed saying that if any advertisement for sale of roosters finds way through their filters, they would ensure that it gets taken down immediately.
 
 HSI had sent a letter to Amarjit Singh Batra, CEO of OLX, urging him to withdraw all such advertisements.
 
 Cock fights are popular during the Sankranti festival in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and involve specially-trained roosters fitted with sharp metal extensions on their talons. The roosters are made to fight to the death.
 
 The OLX advertisements have been criticised by HSI for encouraging participation in an illegal activity. The advertisements were placed from several areas of the city.
