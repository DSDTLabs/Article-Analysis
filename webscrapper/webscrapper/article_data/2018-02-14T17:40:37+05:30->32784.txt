India climbed to the top of the ICC ODI rankings after their 73-run win over   in Port Elizabeth in the 5th ODI on Tuesday. 

 After victories in Durban (by six wickets), Centurion (by nine wickets) and Cape Town (by 124 runs), India were beaten on Saturday in a rain-hit fourth ODI, but stormed back to claim the series with at Port Elizabeth and with that completed their first ever bilateral ODI series win in South Africa. 
 
 This meant the Indian team ascended to the top spot with 122 points as SA slipped from 121 to 118 points. India had started the series with 119 points, two behind South Africa, and needed at least four wins to gain a spot in the rankings. 
 
 No Indian men's side since its first tour in South Africa back in 1992, has ever won a series across any format. They did win a one-off T20 match in 2006 -- their first ever shortest format but it was a single match event. The team under Kohli achieved which neither among Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid or Mahendra Singh Dhioni could ever accomplish -- win a full fledged series in the Rainbow Nation.
 
 After a series of low scores, Rohit Sharma came good when it ultimately mattered as he scored 115 in India's respectable total of 274 for 7 on a sluggish St Georege's Park wicket.
 
 South Africa did put up a fight before wrist spinners Kuldeep Yadav (4/57 in 10 overs) and Yuzvendra Chahal (2/43 in 9.2 overs) found their bearings after a rare off-day to polish off the lower-order in a jiffy as the home team were shot out for 201 in 42.2 overs.
