PUNE: Pushpa Waghmode is not getting foodgrain from a fair price shop for two months now even as she had got her   linked with the ration card. 

 
 “Last month, my name was not in the list at the shop. Even as my name was included in the list after follow-ups, I did not get ration this time because of fingerprint authentication failure,” rued Waghmode, who supports her family by working as a domestic help.
 
 Another beneficiary,  , said she has not been getting ration from January. “I took my Aadhaar card to the fair price shop on Wednesday. Even after entering details and giving my fingerprints, the data did not match,” she said.
 
 Wahmode and Rajput are not alone. Poor signal and technical glitches while matching fingerprints are leaving several Aadhaar and ration card-linked beneficiaries deprived of foodgrain in fair price shops across the district.
 
 Activist   has met several such beneficiaries and made her submission to district collector Naval Kishore Ram. She said the beneficiaries were earlier deprived because of the problems in linking Aadhaar with ration cards and the current hindrance was with the point-of-sale machines. “There is no point having equipment that do help the beneficiaries,” she said, adding that the collector has pledged a hearing in the first week of June.
 
 The state government had introduced the electronic-Point of   to check irregularities such as black-marketing and diverting foodgrain from depots. However, the machines were of not much help for the beneficiaries because of poor signals.
 
 Deputy commissioner (supply)   told TOI that they have provided a helpline (1800224950, 1800221967) for the beneficiaries to contact the authorities from 10am to 5.30pm in case of any complaint. The district supply officer has been appointed as the nominee for complaints related to the fingerprint authentication failure.
