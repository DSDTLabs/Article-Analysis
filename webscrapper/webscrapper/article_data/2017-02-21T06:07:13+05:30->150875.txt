BENGALURU: Chief minister   has ordered additional chief secretary   to conduct a probe into the   forest fire in which a forest guard was charred to death.
The CM was disappointed with forest department officials for failing to take precautionary measures to check the fire and save the guard. Addressing them during the state wildlife board meeting here on Monday, he asked, “Why was no action taken to stop the fire from spreading at Bandipur forest?“ The officials maintained that it was the handiwork of miscreants. The situation, they said, went out of control as the miscreants targeted four to five places in the area. Not convinced with the response, the CM further asked, “When was the last time you visited the forests?
 How did the miscreants gain entry there and what were you'll doing when this happened?“ Later, forest minister   told reporters that the state government would provide a compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the family of  , the guard who died fighting the flames in Kalkere range of Bandipur forest.
