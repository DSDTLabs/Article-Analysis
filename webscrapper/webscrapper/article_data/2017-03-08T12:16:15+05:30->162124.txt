SHIMLA: The Himachal Pradesh high court has sought a fresh status report on progress in construction of Theog-Kotkhai-Rohru National Highway.

 A division bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   passed the order after going through a report filed by a two-member   about the progress of construction work.
 
 The bench said, "We have gone through the report and it appears that all the concerned authorities are taking steps in order to take the work to its logical end." In its earlier order, the court had constituted the monitoring committee to oversee the progress of the work with a direction to submit its report fortnightly.
 
 The court listed the matter for further hearing on April 24. The road is one of the most important roads to the apple belt area and it carries about 70-80% of the stateâ€™s entire apple produce. But unfortunately the condition of the road is so pathetic that it is considered as one of the worst route in this hill state. During peak time of apple harvest season, traffic goes up from July to September.
 
 The condition of the road worsens during apple season when heavy loaded trucks with apple boxes cause huge traffic jams and become a nuisance for the commuters. Instead of three hours it takes 10-12 hours to complete the 80-km journey as traffic jams last for several hours. Besides, apple crop worth hundredagencies
