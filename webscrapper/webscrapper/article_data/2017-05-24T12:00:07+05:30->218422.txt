A lot of hue and cry has been made around over the titling of the upcoming   film, based on M T's book Randamoozham, as 'Mahabharata'.

 After politician   said that she won't allow the movie to be named thus, MLA V T Balram recently wrote on his social media page that he is waiting for a blog post from Mohanlal that will "Educate sankhis like Sashikala, what Mahabharata actually is all about."
 
 While a section argues that titling M T's version of the book as Mahabharata will confuse people, the rest are of the opinion that the epic is not confined to the book, but is a collection of many stories and sub-stories that spread even beyond the book format. "It's not limited to the monolithic text by Vyasan and it's not just a book of religion either," says Balram, in his social media post.
