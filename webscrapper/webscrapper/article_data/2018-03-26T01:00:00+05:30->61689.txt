SASARAM: Almost 12 hours after her boyfriend died in a road accident on the Chand-Dharauli Road, an Intermediate student allegedly committed suicide at Sihori village under the Chand police station area in Kaimur on Friday night. “The girl, identified as Priyanka Kumari (19), had been living with her maternal grandfather in the village since childhood. Locals claimed that she hung herself from the bell of a temple after her boyfriend Raju Prasad Gupta, who was also a college mate, met with a fatal accident on Thursday,” Chand police station SHO Santosh Kumar said, adding no suicide note was recovered from the spot. Gupta was the son of a local trader.
