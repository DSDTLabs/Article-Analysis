CHENNAI: There was no twist in the tale as   won the   title that he missed by a whisker four years back. He had then gone down fighting to   in a three-setter, but on Sunday experience prevailed over youth as he defeated 20-year old   from Russia 6-3, 6-4 in a match that lasted an hour and 15 minutes.

 For Agut, the road to final was not easy. But the Spaniard clearly saved his best for the last. He put on an aggressive show not allowing a single break point. Instead he rattled Medvedev reading his game perfectly. He took advantage of Medvedev's weakness in dealing with low balls and kept his shots flat thus forcing the Russian into committing errors. He covered the court well and came up with forehand winners at crucial times. "I think I played a complete match today. This was a great start to the year. Whenever I had the option I was trying to make him move and then he started missing a lot of first serves and that helped," said the Spaniard.
 
 Medvedev had a fairytale run so far in the tournament, but Sunday was different. "Agut was clearly the better player today and was very consistent. He played aggressive tennis and was intelligent with his game," Medvedev said.
 
 Even though he lost the final, this was the best week of his career till now. "If anyone had told me at the beginning of the week that I would be playing my first ATP final I wouldn't have believed him. I wouldn't have cared if I lost the final 6-0, 6-0, I was happy to be a part of it. My rankings have shot up from 99 to the 60s after the final and I couldn't have asked for more."
 
 The Russian began well hitting a couple of aces in his first service game but Agut took advantage of a double fault and an unforced error from Medvedev in the fourth game to go one break up. He stopped Agut from breaking him again in the sixth game with two back-to-back aces and a backhand down the line. But he could not make any inroads into the Agut serve and the Spaniard wrapped the set up.
