LUCKNOW: Scores of citizens on Sunday formed a human chain at GPO in   to support peace, unity and stand together against communal forces.

 Holding placards and posters advocating peace and non-violence, the gathering bought together a number of like-minded individuals in the city. There was no political or social banner on the day.
 
 The human chain was organised especially in the aftermath of recent violence in   in which a youth was killed.
 
 Holding the hands of one other, bereft of any inhibitions of class, caste, religion or creed, scores of intellectuals, academicians, students, activists, teachers, businessmen and commoners stood in queue with posters in Hindi, English and   appealing for peace and unity. Addressing the gathering, activist and former LU vice-chancellor Prof   said, “In my entire life, I have not come across such times where secularism, democracy and the Constitution were in such danger.”
 
 Prof   said, “These are times when middle class people need to come out of their shelled lives and become part of the movements that are fighting for democracy and protecting India’s social fabric.”
