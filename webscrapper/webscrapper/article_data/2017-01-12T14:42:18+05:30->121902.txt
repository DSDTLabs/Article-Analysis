CHENNAI: The   of the University of Madras will meet at 4pm on Thursday, and it is set for a fiery showdown because of at least a couple of contentious items on the agenda. 

 The first one is regarding the tenure of the controller of examinations (CoE) S Thirumagan. Thirumagan's three-year tenure is set to end this month and there is an agenda item regarding the same. However, sources in the university said he had been approaching the syndicate members and other authorities to push for an extension of tenure.
 
 The university had not given out an advertisement calling for applications to the post of CoE, professors said. The process of appointing a new CoE could take up to six months. 
 
 The registrar's term is also due to end in March and this would effectively make the university's three top posts -- vice-chancellor, registrar and CoE -- vacant. 
 
 It may be recalled that university hasnâ€™t had a vice-chancellor for a year now. The duties of the VC are being carried out by a three-member convener committee which has led to a number of academic and procedural files not moving in the university. 
 
 The convocation could not be held this December as the office of the   - the chancellor of the university - was petitioned that it shouldn't be held in the absence of a VC.
 
 Another contentious issue on the agenda is promotions demanded by certain professors who have obtained their degrees from open universities. A senior syndicate member said that such professors can be confirmed only if they have completed 12 years of school education. The syndicate would debate on this issue as well, he said.
