CHANDIGARH: Following a meeting with AAP   affairs in-charge earlier this month, state unit co-president  , on Thursday, announced the decision to constitute a 21-member core committee to “unanimously decide the future course of affairs” in the state. The move comes in the wake of the demand for more autonomy and less interference from the high command in view of the party’s performance in the last assembly elections.

 Addressing reporters, Punjab AAP co-president Arora said it was a longstanding demand of the state leadership to form a core committee that could take decisions on its own. He said it took some time to form the committee because of previous commitments of the central leadership and state in-charge Manish Sisodia. He also said the panel will have 13 permanent and eight ex-officio members.
 
 The party assigned the responsibility of structure building to Dr Balbir Singh, relieving Aman Arora of the responsibility. Arora had requested the party high for this, citing time constraints and his commitment towards people of his constituency.
 
 Arora said the committee will now be independent to take decisions regarding state affairs in future. He also said it would accelerate the process of widening the party base in the state. A report on the Shahkot bypoll will be prepared within a week after consulting volunteers and zone presidents of the state, he said.
 
 AAP president Bhagwant Mann, opposition leader  , MP Prof Sadhu Singh, MLA Kanwar Sandhu, Sarabjit Kaur Manuke, MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan, MLA Baljinder Kaur, Gulshan Chhabra, Inderbir Singh Nijjer, Dr Ravjot Singh, Dr Balbir Singh, Manjinder Singh Sidhu and Aman Arora will be permanent members while Harjot Singh Bains, Garry Birring, Sukhwinder Singh Sukhi, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, Paramjeet Singh Sachdeva, Anil Thakur, Gurdit Singh Sekhon and Dalbir Singh Dhillon will be ex-officio members.
