NEW DELHI/AHMEDABAD: Gujarat chief minister   said on Monday that Congress vice president  's visit to the state reflects the party has “no credible“ local leaders.

 Gandhi began his three-day visit on Monday from the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, where assembly elections are due later this year.
 
 The Congress has also launched a social media campaign 'development gone crazy' in Gujarat, criticising the BJP government, which has ruled the state uninterrupted for 19 years.
 
 Rupani dismissed the Congress's campaign, saying the criticism is only in the media.
 
 “Rahul Gandhi's coming (to Gujarat) is an admission that the Congress has no credible local leadership. Had they been strong and visible, he would not have had to go,“ Rupani told reporters here after the groundbreaking ceremony of the Gujarat Sadan here.
 
 The chief minister, whose party is gearing up for one of its difficult electoral battles in the state, exuded confidence that the BJP will sweep the assembly elections.
 
 “Now that Narendra Modi is the prime minister, we have set a target of 150 seats. We will also once again sweep all 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state,“ Rupani said.
 
 Meanwhile, Gujarat BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya termed Rahul Gandhi's road show in Saurashtra as a flop show. He said the road show failed to attract people. “The Congress did attempt to mobilize people from across the Saurashtra region, but failed to elicit response from people,“ Pandya said. Pandya said that the Congress has lost as many as 28 elections across the nation under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. “He never speaks about the good things of Gujarat.He doesn't reply to the questions regarding injustice caused to Gujarat by Congress-led governments at the Centre,“ he added. “Why Congress opposed Narmada project? Delay in Narmada dam was a sin committed by Congress. Rahul Gandhi should apologise to farmers, women and people of Gujarat,“ Pandya said.
