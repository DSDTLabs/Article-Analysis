Built for immersion of idols during festivals, particularly during  , several artificial ponds around existing lakes in the city have now turned into breeding grounds for mosquitoes and dumping yards. With lack of maintenance, these ponds are now a health disaster in the making.

This has led to spurt in mosquito menace and a persistent rancid smell in and around the area. That a gate installed to protect the pond has been pulled down by miscreants has only made matters worse.

When I contacted the gram panchayat, the officials said they have no funds to manage it,” said   of Dhruvansh, an NGO working on preservation of lakes. While the   ( ) has handed over the maintenance of the water body to the local panchayat, Choudhary said the civic body must also take responsibility of maintaining it as it was built by the corporation.
 
 The condition of the ponds around   lake and Kapra lake are no different. These are built and maintained by GHMC. Garbage is scattered all over the ponds, while dirty water full of silt is an eyesore to the passers-by.

Sekhar Reddy, superintendent engineer, lakes division, GHMC, said that they have requested for 150 police personnel near all the artificial ponds and 25 have been deployed at various ponds.
