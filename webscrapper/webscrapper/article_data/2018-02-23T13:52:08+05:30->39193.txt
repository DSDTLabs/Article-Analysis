MANGALURU: Hotelier-cum-philanthropist   from Bhatkal, who gave poor school students ‘mid-day’ meals at a nominal charge of Rs 5, passed away at a private hospital in the city on Tuesday. 

 Bhat, owner of Hotel Srinivas Deluxe, was 61. 
 
 He was suffering from a malignant condition of the throat for many years, which worsened in the last few days. 
 
 He was admitted to the ICU at Yenepoya Hospital on Monday, and passed away the next day. His body was taken to Bhatkal on the same night, and funeral was performed on Wednesday. Madhav Bhat is survived by his wife Rajani and son Aditya. 
 
 Madhav had embraced this philanthropic mission more than 25 years back, long before the government introduced the free mid-day meal scheme. Any school kid could walk into his hotel and have rice and sambar for Rs 5. 
 
 Over 1,000 children availed this facility every day.tnn
