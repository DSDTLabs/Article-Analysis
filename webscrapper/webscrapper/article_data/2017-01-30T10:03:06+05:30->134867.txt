JABALPUR: Fed up with recurrent problem of   in his house, Mukesh Lamba, a Jabalpur-based businessman, decided to lift his house in the air. The house spread over 2,600 sq feet is now being jacked up six feet above the ground level.

 A Haryana-based firm, which offers expertise, has put around 30 workers on the job: keeping 500 jacks under the building. The reconstruction work began last week this month. The house has been lifted by 4 feet till date. It will take one more week to complete the work.
 
 Lamba, a resident of  , who faced problem of sewage entering his house and water oozing out of tiles in rainy season for last six years, is confident, monsoon will be different this year.
 
 Azad Singh from Hissar, who specialises in lifting houses from foundation using screw jacks is raising height of Lamba’s home by 2 feet every day while keeping its appearance, electrical wiring and plumbing intact.
 
 “They carve out three feet of ground in and around the house, remove flooring and place jacks through a long-running channel. By synchronised rotation of jacks in 100 moves, they can lift the building up by four inches,” Lamba said.
 
 Since quality of bricks in   was found to be weak, new concrete blocks are being used to re-lay foundation of the house.
 
 Lamba, who has shifted to a rented accommodation with his family, hopes the method will prove effective for others in the city. Lamba and Azad Singh are relatives. “It’s not a matter of cost. Lamba is my relative. We have done 400 such cases across India in recent years,” Singh told TOI.
 
 The exercise made Lamba’s neighbours curious. They now contact Singh enquiring about money it takes to lift a house and some of them have already exchanged phone numbers to go for the same exercise in coming months.
 
 “We can lift any building up to 11 feet, including multi-storeyed structures,” Singh told TOI. He claims he specialises in straightening tilted buildings.
