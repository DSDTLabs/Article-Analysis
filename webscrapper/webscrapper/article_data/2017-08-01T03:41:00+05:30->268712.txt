Depending on these documents, the government will consider which animal should be declared as vermin,” he added Agriculture minister Vijai Sardesai told the assembly on Monday that the government was trying to look for a solution for vermin. “I know it’s a big issue. We will find a solution as early as possible,” said Sardesai, while replying to a question tabled by Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar. Gaonkar said farmers in his constituency are a troubled lot as monkeys keep destroying their crops.  “The yield fo r farmers has reduced,” the MLA said and sought to know the steps the government plans to take to help the farmers.
