PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: NCP leader   on Thursday said he will quit politics if it is proved that he sided with corruption. 

 “I have never asked any office-bearer to do anything wrong. If (it is proved) that I have ever told anyone to do wrong things, I will quit politics. BJP leaders have indulged in corruption and are accusing us of wrongdoings,” he said while launching the civic election campaign in Pimpri Chinchwad on Thursday. 
 
 He said people who held various positions in the NCP and have now joined the BJP are taking potshots at the NCP. 
 
 “BJP workers are blind when they say that no development works have happened in the last 10 years. We are focused on more development works. Pimpri Chinchwad was adjudged the best city in the entire country,” he said.
 
 The BJP government in the state has not been able to address unauthorized constructions, the penalty tax on them, nor the red zone issues where development is not allowed around defence areas. 
 
 “The state government had said it would make Maharashtra roads toll-free. Instead, it increased toll contracts for many more years. Law and order has worsened in the state in the last two and half years,” Pawar said.
 
 After the break-up of the alliance in Pimpri Chinchwad between the BJP and  , they are taking potshots at each other, he said. 
 
 Pawar, at a press conference earlier in the day, said, “We will highlight our development works in the past five years and ask people to re-elect us.   along with Dhananjay Munde, Sunil Tatkare, Dilip Walse Patil will address election meetings in Pimpri Chinchwad,” Pawar said. 
 
 Pawar said guardian minister   had hardly visited Pimpri Chinchwad. Bapat shifted the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) office from the new PCNTDA office building in Akurdi to Pune, he added.
