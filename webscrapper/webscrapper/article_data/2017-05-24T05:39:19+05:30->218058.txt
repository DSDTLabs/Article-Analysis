NEW DELHI: After a retired   officer was denied entry into  , the government lodged a strong protest with the Canadian government forcing the latter to express regret for the inconvenience caused to the officer. 

 The retired CRPF   was turned away for allegedly having worked with a force which “committed widespread and systemic human rights abuses”. After the protest, Canada made amends for the “unacceptable” act as its high commissioner Nadir   issued a statement late in the evening expressing regret for the inconvenience caused and also declaring that CRPF played an important role in upholding law and order in India. 
 
 After he landed at the Vancouver airport, Tejinder Singh Dhillon, a retired IGP with CRPF, was told by Canadian immigration authorities that he could not enter the country as he had been part of a force which indulged in terrorism and genocide. Patel said though that from time to time, with such a large number of applications, oversights on visa applications can happen which is regrettable. “In situations where established procedures may not have been followed, a review takes place to avoid any reoccurrence,” he said, adding that Canada valued its relationship with India, based on shared values of democracy, pluralism, human rights and rule of law. In its protest, the government had said that such characterisation of a reputed force like CRPF was completely unacceptable. “We have taken up the matter with the government of Canada,” said MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay.
 
 According to agency reports, Dhillon, who had retired six years ago, was declared inadmissible under a subsection of Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. “I’ve been travelling to Canada for 30 years but this is the first time I faced such insult and humiliation,” Dhillon was quoted as having told anews channel. In the past too, Canada has denied visas to serving and former officials of armed forces, leading home ministry in 2010 to threaten retaliatory measures.
