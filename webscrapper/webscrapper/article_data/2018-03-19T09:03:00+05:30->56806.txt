CHANDIGARH:   (PU) has asked its departments to appoint teacher-mentors for its students in each department. Dean university of instruction (DUI)   issued a circular recently asking all the department chairpersons to appoint the teacher-mentors on the lines of school of communication studies, which follows the mentor -mentee programme. 

 "As you know the latest requirement from   is that all students of a department should have a teacher-mentor. Therefore, you are requested to please appoint a teacher-mentor for all the students of the department and send a note of compliance to the   that all students of your department now have a teacher-mentor," read the communication by the internal quality assurance cell to the university departments. 
 
 The university had a tradition of appointing mentors for students. This would let students discuss their personal and academic problems with their respective mentors. The tradition had collapsed around six years ago and now the university was trying to revive it.
 
 "A record of such appointments be please kept within the department as also a brief record of the meetings that the teacher-mentors have with students. All students also would have to be informed about who their teacher-mentor is, whom to turn for any help they need over and above normal classroom work. Each department is free to decide on the modalities of such appointments and the manner in which the mentor would work," read the communication. More than 50% departments have complied with this and the rest are likely to follow.
