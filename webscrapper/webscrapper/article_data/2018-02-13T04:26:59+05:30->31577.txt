MUMBAI:   should not be held responsible for the MRI accident at civic-run   in which a patient’s relative died, said the Indian Radiological and Imaging Association’s (IRIA) state branch in a   submitted to the   and BMC chief on Monday.

 The IRIA has spoken to the two doctors, who were arrested, and recreated a sequence of events. On January 27, Lalbaug resident Rajesh Maru was pulled into the machine when he walked into the MRI suite with an oxygen cylinder. Metallic objects are prohibited in the MRI suite, yet no one stopped Maru, said the IRIA. “Innocent persons should not be made scapegoats to shield the real culprits...Junior doctors/residents should not be punished for the failure of management and system failure,” said the letter signed by IRIA secretary Dr Aniruddha Kulkarni. 
 
 Radiologists said nurses in the MRI department are only available till 4pm on weekends. “Even technicians and ward boys were not available that day,” said a doctor. Former IRIA chief Dr Jignesh Thakkar said doctors have to make the patient comfortable in the MRI gantry and then rush to the console room for the imaging process. “You cannot expect them to be security guards too.” 
 
 IRIA has demanded a “fair and impartial inquiry” incorporating its points. “All those responsible for the system failure should be brought to book,” said the letter, adding that “the charges on the doctors under IPC Section 402A be withdrawn immediately”.
