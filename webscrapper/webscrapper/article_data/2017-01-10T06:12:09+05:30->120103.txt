AHMEDABAD: As regional office of   (RBI) failed to take the deposits of the   of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, a group of people on Monday created a ruckus at the RBI office in   area of the city.

 People alleged that the RBI officials refused to pay heed to them despite the Union finance ministry’s assurance that the non residential Indians could deposit or change their old invalidated notes in the RBI.
 
 US-based NRI Vipul Thakkar said that he had been coming to the RBI for the past two days to change his currency notes worth of Rs 10,000, but not a single official from the bank bothered to attend to him.
 
 “The government has made the norms and the RBI is not following them. One official said that I could deposit my currency at the Reserve Bank of India’s centres in Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Nagpur. When a large number of NRIs belong to Gujarat, why the facility has not been made available at this regional centre in Ahmedabad,” Thakkar said.
