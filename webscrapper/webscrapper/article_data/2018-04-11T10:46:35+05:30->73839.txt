NEW DELHI:   has become India’s second double-medalist at the 2018   by taking bronze in the 50m pistol men’s final on Wednesday, shooting a total score of 201.1 to finish third. 

 
 
 
 Mitharval - a bronze winner in the men’s 10m air pistol two days ago - topped the qualification round and put in a very good performance in the 10-man finals, even as defending champion   shot a disappointing 105 to finish last. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Mitharval topped the first round with a series of solid shots, then fell to second as Singapore’s Swee Hon Lim surged ahead in stage 2 (elimination) with shots of 9.4 and 10.1. Australia’s Daniel Repacholi - a two-time   gold medallist - briefly stormed to the lead with a stunning sequence of 10, 10.1, 10.2 and 9.7 but Mitharval rallied back with shots of 10.2 and 10 to eliminate Lim. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 An engrossing tussle ensued between Repacholi and Mitharval, who exchanged shots of 9.8 and 10.1 against 8.6 and 9.2 before the Australian closed out the gold medal with shots of 9.6, 10.7, 9.3 and 9.2. Well placed at second, Mitharval lost his focus and shot 7.2 and 7.6 while Bangladesh’s Shakil Ahmed launched a strong run with 9.1, 9.5, 9.6 and 8.7 to take silver with a toal of 220.5. 
 
 Jitu had qualified for the final in sixth place with a score of 542-8x whereas Mitharval topped the qualification round with a score of 549-6x.
