Mumbai: If a senior BJP cabinet member is to be believed, chief secretary   will be the new  . The five-year tenure of incumbent CIC   ends on May 31.

 Gaikwad, who was appointed CIC in May 2012 after retirement, was instrumental in reva-mping the information commission and setting a new benchmark in clearing pending cases.
 
 Mullick, an IAS officer of the 1982 batch, took over the reins of the state bureaucracy on April 1, from Swadheen Kshatriya on his retirement. Mullick is due for retirement on April 30, 2018. Additional   (home)   and additional chief secretary   are among the top contenders for the chief secretary post. Both Shrivastava and Jain belong to the 1983 batch. Another 1983 batch officer,  , the senior-most IAS official, too is under consideration.
 
 In a text reply to TOI, Mullick claimed he is not in the race for the CIC post, but the cabinet member said CM Devendra Fadnavis is keen on his appointment. “Fadnavis will interact with Mullick. If he agrees, the proposal, along with all the names, will be placed before the CM-headed selection committee,” he said.
 
 In the event Mullick is appointed CIC, there will be high level changes in the bureaucracy following empanelment of a section of senior bureaucrats. Veteran bureaucrats Malini Shankar, Ajay Bhushan Pande and Sanjay Bhatia who have been empanelled, are already on central deputation. Fadnavis will not relieve BMC chief Ajoy Mehta, while additional chief secretary Bhagwan Sahai may be relieved for central deputation. Vijay Suryawanshi, presently on central deputation, may be appointed Mumbai collector in place of Ashwini Joshi, who has taken over as excise commissioner. MMRDA commissioner U P S Madan and industries secretary Apporchandra are due for transfer as both have complted their tenure.
