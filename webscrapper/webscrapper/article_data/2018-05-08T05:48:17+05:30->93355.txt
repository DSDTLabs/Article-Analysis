MUMBAI: Barely seven years after it was constructed, the   will undergo full structural repairs at the cost of Rs 16 crore. 

 The  , which has taken over maintenance from   ( ) that had got it constructed at a cost of about Rs 150 crore, will table the proposal before the civic standing committee meeting on May 9. The 2.5-km flyover between the ITC hotel in Parel and Jijamata Udyan in Byculla was inaugurated in June 2011 to ease congestion on Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Road. 
 
 
  
 
 In November 2016, barely five years later, a 200mm gap was noticed between two slabs of the flyover. Officials said the expansion joints on the north-bound arm had loosened and the rubber seal had come off. This was just after the five-year defect liability period ended for contractor Simplex. 
 
 “Structural repairs would include replacement of the joints and bearings on the bridge wherever required and also some external work. Full-fledged repairs may begin only after monsoons on October 1 and should take around six months,” said an official of the BMC’s bridges department. 
 
 Civic activists said this speaks very poorly about the quality of construction. “We are living in times where British era bridges have survived for several decades together and a flyover constructed barely seven years ago needs such a huge amount of repairs,” said activist Nikhil Desai from King’s Circle. 
 
 Sion’s G R Vora said this was a clear example of shoddy work by the contractor. “Even if the contractor has done shoddy work, the question remains as to what the officials who are expected to monitor the construction were doing. Accountability needs to be fixed,” said Vora. 
 
 Transport expert Ashok Datar said it was unfortunate that within a short span of construction such huge repairs were required. “The MMRDA, as an agency, has a lot of experience in construction of flyovers in the city and, therefore, such huge repairs within a short span do hit their reputation,” said Datar.
