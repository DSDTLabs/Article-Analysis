KOLKATA: Years before she was selected to train as the first woman firefighter at the   (AAI), a chemistry teacher had given   the moniker birangana meaning ‘brave woman’. Tanya’s elder sister Tanima had always known her to be fearless.

 
 “One evening at the chemistry class, the girls suddenly screamed and scrambled up on to the chairs. I realised it was a cockroach that had caused the panic. I caught it and threw it out of the window. The teacher was shocked and named me Birangana,” recounted the Dum Dum girl who suddenly finds herself in the limelight in an allmale profession.
 
 Good at classical dance and painting,   wasn’t aware of where she was headed till she bumped upon the AAI advertisement that changed the course of her life.
 
 “I had a desire to do something different, but didn’t know what till this opportunity came by. The exam went off well. On  , a letter arrived stating that I had qualified and had to report to Bhubaneswar for physical fitness and medical tests. Thrilled, I forgot about Durga Puja and began to train for the fitness exam,” she narrated.
 
 She passed the test, that included a 100-metre sprint within 20 seconds, lifting 40kg and climbing up a rope.
 
 Currently undergoing training in Delhi, Tanya is enjoying the course. “Since I am the first woman, everyone is very supportive and encouraging. I consider myself extremely lucky,” said Tanya.
 
 She is aware of the challenges that the job entails. Tanya says the biggest thrill in the job is the lightning speed with which the team has to head into a crisis. “At an airport, there is the criticality of time. The   tenders have to move out within 90 seconds. If a plane catches fire, it must be doused within 2 minutes and 18 seconds. For that is as much one can get before the fuel tank catches fire and explodes,” she explained excitedly.
 
 She can’t wait till June 9 when she gradutes and is given the first posting at an airport.
