And trust it to be worth every second of your wait!
 
 The trailer, which starts with the India-Pakistan tension, shows   as an Indian, being married off to a Pakistani by her father so that she can be the ‘eyes and ears’ of India in Pakistan.

 As a nation, while we boast of having people who fight and die for the nation, we also have some others whose contributions are not in any of our records, who are just stories of braveries. Meghna Gulzar’s espionage drama tells us the tale of one such unsung hero who left her mark on the Indian flag and our minds forever.
