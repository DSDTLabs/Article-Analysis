CHARMINAR: Hour-long   between   and   are making life miserable for commuters and residents. Motorists heading towards Misrigunj and traffic going towards   get stuck at Fateh Darwaza what with its battered and narrow roads triggering gridlocks.

 “Every time, traffic goes out of gear here, no traffic personnel are around. While it is the traffic police department's responsibility to ensure smooth flow of traffic, no one comes here to regulate traffic. During peak hours, motorists alone regulate traffic flow here. There should be at least one traffic constable present,'' a trader at Fateh Darwaza told TOI.
 
 The road needs immedia te repairs and residents have urged authorities to carry out patchwork on the busy Fateh Darwaza road as it slows down traffic movement and even triggers minor accidents. “Traffic jam is a regular feature at Fateh Darwaza road. Traffic comes to a halt for hours during the night. If any   bus passes through the route, it blocks traffic. No patchwork has been done in this route,'' Mohd Asif, a regular commuter said.
