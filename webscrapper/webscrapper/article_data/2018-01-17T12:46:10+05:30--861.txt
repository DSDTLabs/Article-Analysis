MARGAO: Chief minister Manohar   on Tuesday said that the history of Goa’s liberation struggle and that of the   movement will be included in the school curriculum before the commencement of the academic year 2019.

 Stating that history as taught in schools was incomplete as it didn’t include the history of Goa’s liberation struggle as also the Opinion Poll, Parrikar said a committee will be formed to study the issue so as to facilitate inclusion of these two movements in the school curriculum. He was speaking at the state-level celebration of the Goa’s Opinion Poll Day at Ravindra Bhavan, Margao. 
 
 Cabinet ministers Vijai  , Vinod Palyekar, and   legislator   were among others who were present on the dais. 
 
 Sardesai, in his address, said that while Goa voted against a merger in the 1967 Opinion Poll, influx of a large number of migrant population into Goa had turned out to be the biggest challenge before Goans today. 
 
 Stating that there was a “systematic plan” to erase the memories of the Opinion Poll from the minds of the people, Sardesai said that he was determined to ensure that the inclusion of the history of the Opinion Poll movement, as assured by the chief minister, was properly implemented.
 
 Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, speaking on the occasion, said that he would propose a resolution to erect the statue of Jack de Sequeira, one of the stalwarts of the Opinion Poll movement, in the legislative assembly complex. He also suggested that portraits of all the stalwarts of the movements be installed in the legislative assembly complex.
 
 Earlier, the Colva circle area was named the Opinion Poll Square in the presence of Parrikar and other dignitaries. Portraits of several stalwarts of the Opinion Poll movement were installed along the promenade leading to the Ravindra Bhavan.
