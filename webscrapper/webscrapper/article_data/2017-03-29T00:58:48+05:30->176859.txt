NEW DELHI: A day before the Supreme Court’s final hearing on implementation of BS-IV norms from April 1, 2017, civil society organisations urged citizens to tweet Union ministers of environment and power with their concerns about  . 

 Help Delhi Breathe—a coalition of environmental NGOs—and residents slammed the Centre’s move to support automobile manufacturers and allow registration of BS-III vehicles after March 31. 
 
 “The manufacturers have known for long that a full transition to BS-IV vehicles will happen on April 1. The fact that they have been building up a BS-III inventory, suggests that they may be trying to delay introduction of BS IV vehicles by several months,” said Anup Bandivadekar, passenger vehicles programme director,  . “The phase-in of BS-IV standards has been taking place gradually over the past several years. Allowing new BS-III commercial vehicles to register beyond April 1 will lead to high emissions for a couple of decades. As a result, it does not seem appropriate to allow registrations of BS-III vehicles beyond April 1.”
 
 “The transport ministry’s notification gave almost two years to vehicle manufactures to transition to the new emissions norms. The time was good enough and any inventory issue is only because of wrong planning on manufacturers’ front. It’s time we took environmental issues seriously,” said Amit Bhatt, director (integrated transport), World Resource Institute, who is also part of the coalition. 
 
 Organisations like   have opposed the reopening of the Badarpur plant. “There is a series of wrong decisions taken by the government. The Badarpur plant that was shut down last winter should not have been allowed to reopen. Similarly, the Centre should not have supported vehicle manufactures who ignore the April 1 deadline,” said Sunil Dahiya, campaigner, Greenpeace. Organisations such as CEED, Greenpeace, Swechha, United Residents Joint Action and Delhi Clean Air Forum are part of the coalition.
