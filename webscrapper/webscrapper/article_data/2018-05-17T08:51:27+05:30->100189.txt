DEVIPATNAM: It was a tragic sight at the spot on Wednesday where a boat carrying 44 people capsized in   district. 

 Relatives waited for the bodies of their loved ones to be retrieved by divers. With 22 of them having swum to safety as soon as the boat sunk on Tuesday, it was clear that the remaining had died.
 
 
  
 The relatives of the victims, mostly tribals, had been waiting at the spot near   village in   since Tuesday night. 
 
 As soon as the rescue teams retrieved a body, all of them rushed to identify it. When one group started wailing loudly, it became clear that it was their loved one.
 
 Those who survived the tragedy too did not have anything to cheer about. 
 
 Nadipudi   of   village, in her mid-twenties, survived the tragedy only to lose most of her family. Aswini has completed BEd and is studying DEd in   in East Godavari. She was returning home after withdrawing 30,000 from a bank for her college fee. 
 
 Among her family members she was the only one who swam ashore to safety. The rest, her grandfather who was carrying the cash, mother and brother all died.
 
 The plight of Ram Charan, a teenager from Kachchaluru village, who is being treated at the area hospital in  , was no different. He lost his father, mother and two brothers (twins) in the boat tragedy. Even 30 hours after the incident, he is not in position to talk.
 
 It was equally tragic to see elders waiting for the bodies of their children to be retrieved. Neram Durgamma, a 50 year-old woman, was on Wednesday afternoon waiting for the body of her daughter Roja.
 
 Despite the tragedy, most people have no way to avoid travelling on the boat as there is no other means of transport available for them.
