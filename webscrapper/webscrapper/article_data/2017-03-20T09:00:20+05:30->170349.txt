NAGPUR: With no   scheduled in the coming months, state-run power discom   has sought another   hike of around 12%. The petition will be heard by   ( ) on March 23. Tariff had already been hiked by around 10% in November 2016.

 Pratap Hogade of Maharashtra Veej Grahak Sangathana (MVGS) told the media that MSEDCL had filed a petition seeking to recover Rs24,251 crore extra from consumers over a period of three years. “If MERC approves the petition, then the power rates will go up by another 12%,” he said.
 
 Elaborating on the discom’s petition, Hogade said that MSEDCL had sought to recover Rs56,372 crore from consumers in four years. “However, the Commission in its November 2016 order allowed the discom to recover only Rs9,149 crore. This was not to MSEDCL’s liking and now it wants to recover more from consumers,” he further said.
 
 The main grounds for seeking the tariff hike are increase in operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses, hike in subsidy burden due to increased number of agricultural pumps and increase in cost of movable property.
 
 Hogade charged that the claims made by MSEDCL were false and baseless. “The discom is not making any efforts to reduce its expenses by increasing its efficiency and cutting down on wasteful expenditure. It wants to recover the cost of its ineffiency from consumers,” he said.
 
 According to Hogade, the company was juggling figures to conceal its failure to reduce its losses. “It had shown an abnormal increase in connected load of agricultural pumps in 2010-11 and 2011-12. We have submitted evidence to MERC to expose these figures. Even then the discom has sought tariff hike on their basis,” he said.
 
 The consumer activist pointed out that in last 10 to 12 years, MSEDCL had spent around Rs50,000 crore on improving the power infrastructure. “However, there is no perceptible improvement in quality of power supply,” he further said.
