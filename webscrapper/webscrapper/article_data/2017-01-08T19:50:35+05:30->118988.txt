NOIDA: Over 300 home buyers under the banner of   Flat Owners Welfare Association ( ) held a protest from 10:30am to 2:30pm on Sunday afternoon at Noida Extension.

 The buyers have given a call to all 10,000 home buyers to boycott the upcoming UP assembly polls. The buyers have been protesting against delays in the delivery of homes for the last several months through demonstrations and twitter protest via hash-tag  .
 
 "We have buyers not to cast their votes on February 11. The buyers have been taken for a ride by the builders, the state government and Noida Authority. We have been waiting for a very long time, but from farmers' protests, to litigation, we have been suffering delays. We had expected things to be addressed before UP went to elections, but demonetisation has slowed down matters further. So we do not know what the fate of the buyers is going to be now and for how long they will have to wait," Nefowa president Abhishek said.
 
  
  
 "We urge all buyers who attended today's rally to take the message far and beyond and urge all home buyers who have not been handed over houses to refrain from casting votes on February 11. We do not want to participate in an electoral process where leaders, irrespective of any party, do not really care about the home buyers' issue," Shweta Bharti, general secretary, Nefowa, said.
 
 "By delaying our projects beyond measure, the builders have made the buyers suffer no end. So we today protested against Credai, Noida Authority and even UP state government for complete inaction," Indrish Gupta, co-founder, Nefowa, said.
 
 Noida Extension has 58 ongoing projects with over 3 lakh units. Of these about 15000 have been handed over. The buyers claim, by 2016 end, the builders should have handed over about 1.5 lakh units to buyers.
