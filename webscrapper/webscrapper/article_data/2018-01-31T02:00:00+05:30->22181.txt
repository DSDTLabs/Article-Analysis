Students usually forget that a theory-based paper like   is as important as any other subject and not giving it much attention can pull down their overall marks. Talking to Faryal Rumi, Patna Central School teacher Anuradha Singh shares some tips to help Class XII students answer the questions in the best way possible. Excerpts:

 Q.1. How to memorize long answers and sub topics?
 
 It is important to understand the concepts and revise the syllabus at least thrice. Making flow charts while revising topics like share market, stock market and financial management helps remember them well.
 
 Q.2. How important are illustrations?
 
 You can improve the presentation of your answers with the help of illustrations like charts, graphs and tables. Avoid repetition by writing answers in points instead of big paragraphs. This will make the examiner realize that you know what you are talking about.
 
 Q.3. Tell us about the important chapters.
 
 All chapters are important, but students should focus more on the lengthy ones like directing, planning, financial management and marketing. They should read the NCERT book again and again.
 
 Q.4. Any last minute tips for the examinees?
 
 Solve sample papers daily to understand the kind of questions that are asked in board exams. Practice enhances the writing skills of students and makes them confident. They should also sleep properly, eat healthy and revise whatever they have learned in order to score well.
 
 Q.5. Things to be kept in mind while writing the paper...
 
 Giving examples wherever possible will help students fetch good marks. They should never leave any question and underline the key points in every answer. They should also not exceed the word limit by trying to fill in too many words. It is advisable to write those points first which they are sure about and read the questions carefully before attempting the answer.
