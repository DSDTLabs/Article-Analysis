PATIALA: The Sikh character portrayed by Sirsa’s Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmit Ram Rahim Singh in his latest movie ‘Jattu Engineer’ has not gone down well with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ( ) which has decided to take up the matter with the Akal Takht jathedar.

 The committee will also bring the matter before the assembly of various Sikh organizations scheduled to meet in Amritsar on Wednesday.
 
 SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar said the character portrayed in the movie was not in accordance with the Sikh traditions, and it was a serious matter which would be put before the Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh.
 
 He said earlier too, attempts have been made to present Sikhs in a misleading manner in various movies and the SGPC had always tried to get these issues sorted.
 
 He said it was not in good taste to distort the Sikh image for cheap publicity. Badungar said if need be, they would take up the matter at an appropriate level and would even write to the Union information and broadcasting ministry, pointing out that the film violated the tenets of Sikhism.
 
 Earlier, another film ‘MSG - The Messenger of God’ made by the controversial godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim, which was released in 2015, drew strong objections from SGPC and various Sikh organizations. SGPC had also objected to movies depicting Sikhs like ‘Singh is Kinng’ (2008), ‘Son of Sardar’ (2010), ‘Jo Bole So Nihal’ (2005), ‘Singh Saab,’ ‘Nanak Shah Fakir’ and ‘Flying Jatt’.
