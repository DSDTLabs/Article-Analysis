Raghavendra of Arsikere, a truck driver, was bringing a load of cement bags from Gundlupet to Udupi. He stopped the truck by the roadside around 10pm. Even as he was getting into the truck, five members came in a vehicle, blocked his way and dragged him out, smothered him and slashed his chest with a knife before fleeing with cash and mobile phones. 
 
 This incident comes a week after a robbery near Uppinangady. "Though some miscreants were arrested, no stringent measures were taken to curb highway robberies completely in Dakshina Kannada," alleges an activist. Most of the incidents take place along NH48, which passes through a reserve forest. A high-end SUV assigned to keep watch on a 65km stretch of NH48 that starts from Gundya and ends near Perne is gathering dust, alleges the activist.
