CHANDIGARH: The   opposed the bail petition of the arrested   (IFS) officer Birender Choudhary in the  . Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed its reply in special CBI court on Tuesday and the matter would come up for hearing on September 29. 

 CBI had arrested Birendra Choudhary, a member secretary, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) UT red-handed while accepting bribe of Rs 1 lakh on July 17. Rajinder Kumar, owner of the private firm filed a complaint to the CBI and alleged that IFS has been demanding bribe for revoking of consent issued to the complainant by accused. This is pertinent to mention that he withdrew the bail application earlier filed by him as the chargesheet against him was filed on the same day the order was to be pronounced on his bail petition.
 
 The CBI opposed Choudhary’s bail stating that he is a habitual offender and a similar case is also pending against him in Mumbai. The CBI also opposed the bail plea by arguing that he was chargesheeted under 60 days of his arrest and not after 60 days as alleged by him. The CBI mentioned that there are enough proofs against him as Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report confirmed his finger prints on notes. 
 
  It was alleged that three other firm owners with similar issue had also met to Choudhary, who demanded a bribe of Rs 50,000 each from them for not taking any action against them. CBI had tapped the conversation between accused and victims. It laid a trap near the Choudhary’s house and as the complainant handed over the money to member secretary, CBI sleuths arrested him with the bribe at Monday night. CBI claimed that during the search of his house, they recovered cash worth Rs 2 lakhs and documents pertaining to properties and bank accounts. 
 
 It was argued in the bail petition that he has been falsely implicated in the matter.
