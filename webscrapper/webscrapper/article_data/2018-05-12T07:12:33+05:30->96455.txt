BENGALURU: Rathnamma, the 54-year-old woman, who drowned after her   on Thursday night, might have died because of her ill-health, said her daughter Manjula.

 “She was suffering from asthma, diabetes and other age-related illnesses as well,” Manjula said. “This could be the reason why she couldn’t escape the flood.”
 
 The drain near her house has been a long-standing peeve and relatives of Rathnamma and neighbours say their complaints to   have fallen on deaf ears. Police claimed they were informed about the incident on Friday morning by a resident.
 
 Her son Tulasi alleged that flooding in the area was due to repair work on the   at Bettamma Circle, about 50 metre from Rathnamma’s residence. “Every time it rains, water collects at the spot, and since there is no outlet, it enters houses,” Tulasi said.
 
 Officials deny allegations
 
 While BBMP engineers admit repair work on the drain is in progress, they deny claims it was the cause of the flooding. “Work is on to fix poles to fence the drain,” said D H Rangaraju, assistant engineer of Binnypet ward.
 
 “We did receive reports of 1-2 ft of water entering homes closer to where work is on, but it is untrue that the drain work caused 5ft of water to enter the house. The victim’s residence is located on higher ground, so it is unlikely that so much water would have entered,” he added.
 
 Rangaraju claimed while intermittent rain has affected the pace of work, workers had cleared the obstruction. “We have to extend the drain to a small connecting road, but that will require traffic to be diverted for a while. The rain should stop before we can proceed,” he said.
