BENGALURU: A 45-year-old driver with the   ( ) was arrested on Saturday morning for driving his sleeper bus for over 70km, little realising a dead body was stuck in the undercarriage. 

 "This is the most bizarre incident we've seen so far," a senior KSRTC official told STOI, adding: "We've heard of accident victims being dragged by buses for 200-300 metres, but this has completely baffled us." 
 
 Mohinuddin, attached to the   depot, drove the non-airconditioned sleeper bus from Coonoor,   to Bengaluru. The victim was unidentified till late Saturday night.
 
 Mohinuddin reportedly told police: "The bus took the   route to reach Bengaluru. I heard a thud when the bus reached Channapatna, which is 70km from Bengaluru, and I thought the bus had hit a stone. I couldn't spot anything in the rear-view mirrors too and continued driving."
 
  
  
 
 He reached Bengaluru at 2.35am. The bus first went to the Mysuru Road   bus station, then to Majestic and the Shantinagar bus station before it entered the bus depot. Mohinuddin parked the bus and dozed off in the rest room. Around 8am, the bus was taken for a wash and that's when someone noticed the body stuck in the undercarriage. The Wilson Garden police were alerted. 
 
 
 
 The deceased is aged between 30 and 40. We shifted the body to Victoria Hospital and alerted policestations on theBengaluru-Mysuru route. We arrested the driver under Section 304A (causing death due to negligence) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the IPC,” said an official.
 
 Mohinuddin, who has 10 years of experience and has an accident-free record, said: “I never thought a man had come under my bus .”
 
 One driver said: “TheBengaluru-Mysuru road has dozens of speedbreakers. The body should have fallen off the vehicle when the bus went over them. It’s shocking it remained stuck to the chassis.”
