NASHIK: The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)   in the district have identified 25,000 below poverty line (BPL) families for the   but it seems the target group is not keen on taking the connection. 

 "From a list of 25,000 beneficiaries who fit the criteria and 'know your client' details, only 9,327 have been taken the connection," a senior official from an LPG company said. 
 
 Under the scheme, the government bears the cost of connection (Rs 1,450) and the gas stove and refill cylinders are loaned to the customer. The loan amount will be recovered from the government subsidy while booking refill cylinders. The entire gas connection and kit cost around Rs 5,000.
 
 "This is a good opportunity for the BPL families to get an LPG connection without investing a penny," the official said. 
 
 "We received a target of 20,000 connections from the government on March 27 - just four days before the March 31 deadline. We managed to released 3,921 connections by March 31 and 5,406 connections in April," he added. 
 
 In Nashik district, the LPG companies were given a target of providing connections to 10,000 families in 2016-17, which was achieved by October 2016. The target for 2017-18 20,000 connections. 
 
 Prime Minister   launched the   in May last year to provide 5 crore LPG connections to BPLfamilies in the next 3 financial years.
 
 The LPG operators here say that the targets for   are very low compared to other states. "The target in the state is likely to go up in 2018-19 considering the elections for the assembly as well as Parliament," an LPG distributor said.
