NEW DELHI: The only dhalao in east Delhi’s  , which caters to at least 100 households, is overflowing as sanitation workers have not cleared the garbage for the past three days. The narrow lane is strewn with rotten vegetables, plastics and leftover food. As a result, residents are having a tough time walking along the stretch. 

 B S Vohra, president of   RWA Joint Front, is aghast at the constant blame game between the BJP-ruled corporations and the   government. He claimed that a delegation of RWAs from east Delhi would meet deputy CM   on Monday and apprise him of the sanitation crisis.
 
 “This has become a norm now. After every few months, east Delhi turns into a landfill site. If the corporation is not able to pay salaries, then the government should intervene and provide financial assistance,” said Vohra, who too resides in Krishna Nagar.
 
 Vohra added the situation had gone from bad to worse in the past two years. “Both the parties should keep their political agenda aside and work for people to ensure the crisis like this one doesn’t occur again.” He alleged no sweeper had come to this area for the past three days and the garbage disposal had gone for a toss. Residents are either hiring private labourers or just dumping the trash on the road. 
 
 Raj Kumar,   president of Preet Vihar, said they would seek LG Anil Baijal’s intervention in the matter. “The LG is the administrative head of Delhi and only he can resolve the issue between AAP and BJP. People don’t understand who is at fault but they are the ones who are getting affected badly by this strike,” he added.
 
 The situation is no different in Pandav Nagar. Dilip Kumar, a local resident said, “My house is stinking because nobody has come to collect the trash for three days.”
