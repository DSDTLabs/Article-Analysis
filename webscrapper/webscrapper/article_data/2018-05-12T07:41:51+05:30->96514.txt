LUCKNOW: To reduce dependence on grid generated power, Lucknow   Rail Corporation has started using solar power to light up Metro stations and depot.

 
  has installed photo voltaic cells at   depot to generate 1 megawatt solar energy daily.
 
 The 1MW solar energy being produced at Transportnagar depot is feeding power to run lights, lifts, escalators, air conditioners at functional eight Metro stations and the depot. However, even after use, a lot of solar energy is remaining surplus which is being fed into the depotâ€™s grid and would be used later to supply power to the upcoming Metro stations on the North-South corridor.
 
 Officials said they are building another sub-station at   too that would generate solar energy. Both substations at Munshipulia and the depot would be sufficient to cater to all Metro stations on N-S corridor.
 
 At present, LMRC draws 6 mega volt ampere power from UPPCL. Both solar and 6 MVA power are fed daily into LMRC grid to supply power to Metro trains, stations, and depot.
