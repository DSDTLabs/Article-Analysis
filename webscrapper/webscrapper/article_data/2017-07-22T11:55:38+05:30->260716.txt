VADODARA: R C Shah, a planning assistant engineer in   (VUDA), was nabbed by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Wednesday night for demanding bribe of Rs four lakh from a Rajkot-based builder through a middleman Chirag Patel, also an architect.

 Patel, who is also a VUDA authorized architect, was arrested from his office Old   on Wednesday in a trap laid by Surat ACB team. Later, ACB also arrested Shah. ACB sources said that the builder had bought a piece of land on   in 2010 and had started construction of a project in 2011 after getting building permission from VUDA.
 
 In 2016, when the project’s construction was over, the complainant approached Shah to get a completion certificate. He told the police that while applying for certificate, he had even paid a fee of Rs 74,600. On July 5, the builder paid the remaining fee amount of Rs 2.22 lakh. Next day when he asked Shah regarding the status of his application, Shah told him that he will have to give money if he wants the certificate.
 
 According to ACB, Shah then asked the builder to contact Patel and informed that the latter would explain him the procedure. The builder then called Patel on July 13 and asked him about the status of his certificate. Patel said that he will talk to Shah and inform him. Two days later, the complainant again called Patel when the latter said that he will have to pay Rs 4.2 lakh to get the certificate. ACB officials said that of Rs 4.2 lakh, Rs 1.5 lakh was for Patel while the remaining amount was to be paid to Shah.
 
 Meanwhile, the builder approached the ACB and informed about the demanding of bribe. On July 19 when the complainant went to Patel’s office with the money, the duo negotiated and it was decided to take Rs 4 lakh. After the builder paid the money, the agency raided Patel’s office and caught him red-handed with the money. ACB officials said that the builder had recorded his phone conversations with Patel and also the conversation that the duo had at his office.
