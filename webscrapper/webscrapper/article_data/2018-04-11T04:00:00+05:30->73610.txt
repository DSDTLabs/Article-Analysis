Rajkot: The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has formed a special task force of 125 officers and employees to crack down on illegal water connections and water thefts in the city. 

 The force consisting of employees of all departments of the civic body are divided into 18 teams. This decision was taken in the wake of the impending water crisis in days to come and many cases of water theft reported by some hoteliers and commercial users.
 
 Rajkot city is totally dependent on Narmada water. Most traditional water sources in the city have dried up. So, RMC is focusing on saving water and eliminating water theft and illegal connections in the city.
 
 Rajkot needs 240 MLD (million litre per day) of which nearly 200 MLD comes from Narmada which the civic body has to purchase. Aji, Nyari and Bhadar dams, the main sources of water for Rajkot are about to dry up. Aji dam gets Narmada water through canals for the city. Currently, the city gets water for hardly 20 minutes every day. 
 
 RMC commissioner Banchha Nidhi Pani had issued the order for formation of 18 teams to check illegal water connections and water thefts. The officers and employees of departments like tax, drainage, town planning and construction have been assigned the duty. Each team is assigned fixed number of wards.
 
 They will visit the places in areas assigned to them when water is distributed. The civic body has decided on stringent punishment for those who are caught by this team.
