KARWAR:  , an important tourist attraction in   areas of   district will soon get a cable car facility. 

 According to the officials of the tourism department, this is the first cable car to be installed across any   in South India. 
 
 River   drops from a height of nearly 200m in two major steps at Magod Falls, about 17km from   town. It attracts thousands of tourists especially during monsoon. The tourism department has submitted a proposal of Rs 2.5 crore for the cable car. Magod Falls has big hills at both the sides and proposal is to join these hills with a cable car, so that tourists can have an aerial view of the falls. Provision for canteens and rest rooms will be provided atop the hills. The facility will boost   in the region, said Gopalakrishna Bekal, deputy director of tourism. 
 
 Uttara Kannada district minister RV Deshpande said the proposal sent by the tourism department is under consideration and a final decision will be taken weighing the merits of the proposal. Jenukallugudda, another hill station near Magod will also get a boost if Magod Falls gets the cable car facility.
 
 The move will create direct and indirect employment opportunities for local people, stated Ravi Hegde, a resident of the region.
