Noidawalllahs have found a new party venue to host   parties â€“ parks in their residential areas with DJs playing some foot-tapping tracks. Minakshi Goil, a resident of Sector 15-A says, 'DJs playing in parks is not a common sight. So when the nearby residents hear some cool tracks being played in the parks, they join in for the celebration. Jisko dance nahi aata woh log bhi aa kar kuch bhi steps kar lete hain.'

 Sunil Rana, a Greater Noida based   tells us, "I have got calls from the residents of Sector 47 aur Sector 26 to play in their parks. I will be playing tracks like Balam Pichkari, Hori Khele Raghuveera and several other Punjabi numbers."
 
 Shipra Sharma, a resident of Sector 45 says, "At events like these, one gets to meet and greet residents of nearby colonies, and since there is a DJ playing songs in relaxed settings, you automatically connect with others over good music."
 
 Pranav Jain, a Noida based DJ, who is set to play in ATS One Hamlet, Sector 104 said, "We got about eight to ten calls from different colonies in Sector 44 and Sector 45 requesting us to play at their parks, but we had to decline a couple of requests since we already had so many bookings."
 
 Another DJ Ravi Prakash, who mostly plays in Sector 55 told us, "To entertain our guests, we have introduced rain dance as well. We are performing in Sector 76 and Sector 122. We got over 25 calls overall from different societies in Noida."
