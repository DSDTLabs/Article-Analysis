  You can get in touch with your corporator for urgent repairs, maintenance of civic infrastructure like roads or gardens, covering manholes, clearing debris or even re-laying of footpaths.
 
  What’s more, the corporator is supposed to be on call — the BMC gives him a phone specially for carrying out his duties and also pays the bill (subject to a limit). 
 
  
  You can lobby to get good people on the ward committee. These committees were created under the 74th amendment to the Constitution for decentralisation of decision-making, to include citizens. The intention is to get citizens who know the area to help corporators in planning and budgeting for the area. In reality, these ward committees are often filled with those loyal to the corporator. 
 
  
  Keep yourself informed on what your corporator is spending the Rs 1.6 crore on, and whether it aligns with the needs of the area.
