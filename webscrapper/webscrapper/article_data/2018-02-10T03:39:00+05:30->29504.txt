Vijayawada: Cloth stores and super markets are flouting rules by taking advantage of the lack of awareness on mandatory norms among people. This was revealed during the recent raids by   sleuths on cloth stores, of which some are big names in the city.

 Many people do not know about their right to know about the manufacturer ,and also the customer care personnel of the company. Rules mandate that any packaged commodity should contain details such as measurement of the commodity, manufacturing and packing date, full address of manufacturer and the packer, contact details of customer care, and maximum retail price including all taxes.
 
 In case of loose sale of cloth, though all the rules of packaged products are not mandatory, labelling requirements should include name and description of the product, internationally recognisable size indicators, MRP, name and full address of manufacturer, and customer care details.
 
 If garments are sold in packages, the label should have additional details such as any other packaged commodity, including date of packing, quantity, and other details as mandated by the Legal Metrology Act, 2011. In the recent raids, officials found that garments are being sold in packed form, without any proper labelling, and information about the product or its manufacturer.
 
 Legal metrology sleuths also found discrepancies in super markets where the commodities are being sold without any labels at all.
