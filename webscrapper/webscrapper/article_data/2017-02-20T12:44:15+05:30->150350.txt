Uttar Pradesh is like my mai-baap (parents). I am not a son who will ditch his mai-baap. I will always take care of Uttar Pradesh," Modi said, adding, "Krishna was born in Uttar Pradesh but made Gujarat his karma bhoomi. I was born in Gujarat but Uttar Pradesh has adopted me. It is a privilege for me." 

 "The Akhilesh Yadav-led   had claimed his government would get a two-thirds majority. Once the nomination process started, he said they would not be forming any alliance. Then, he began to claim, 'We have made an alliance with the Congress and will win a majority.'"
 
 "The glow has disappeared from Akhilesh Yadav's face, his voice has become feeble, he is afraid and looking for the right words while talking to the media," Modi said, adding the SP chief has "accepted he has lost the game".
 
 The PM said when the SP realised it was "losing the faith of the masses", the "two lost parties - SP and Congress - joined hands with each other to script some stories". Targeting Rahul for allying with the SP, but not naming him, the PM said, "Those born with a silver spoon have realized after taking their '27 saal, UP behal' slogan to the villages, the ground situation is not in their favour. Congress was compelled to ally with the SP for this reason."
 
 Trends from the first two phases of polling, Modi said, show that the BJP will be able to "let flow the Ganga of development" in the state, and that the 'vanwaas (exile)' of UP would end, allowing the state to move forward on the path to development.
 
 He said law and order should be a priority in UP and, if there was no law and order, there would be no investment or development. The poor law and order situation would result in increased migration to other states. "Goonda raj is prevailing all over UP and police stations have become Samajwadi Party offices," Modi claimed.
