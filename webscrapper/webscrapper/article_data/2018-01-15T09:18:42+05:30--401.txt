 “Personally I want women’s doubles to be part of it at least from next year. Several women like Danes - Christinna Pedersen and Kamilla Rytter Juhl - have been asking us. I also think it is time to include it,” he added.
 
 Gopichand also hinted at changes in the PBL format. “The league is attracting a lot of budding youngsters. But we want to target other groups like moviegoers etc. Though the broadcaster will take the final call, we will discuss issues about length of the match, timing etc,” he said Surprisingly, though the change in service rule is advantageous for Indian players who are short, Gopichand said the   (BWF) should have tried it before introducing it. “There is a standard way of calling a serve.   should have tried it before introducing it at the All England. I would definitely have said no to that,” Gopi explained.
 
 He also hit out at BWF’s new schedule. “You should not force tournaments on players. I am against the BWF idea of making it mandatory.”
