SURAT: Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) convener Hadik Patel has threatened to fight Congress if it does not make Amreli MLA  ,   

  Patel was in the city on Thursday in connection with the hearing of sedition case against him in a court. “Congress has emerged as a strong opposition party in Gujarat Assembly and it needs an able leader like Paresh Dhanani. If need be we will fight Congress to see that Dhanani is made the leader of opposition.” 
 
 Dhanani, associated with the Khodaldham Trust, is considered close to Congress president   and has good hold over the voters in his constituency of Amreli. He is considered one of the major reasons behind Congress winning 30 seats out of 54 seats in   and taking its tally in the house to 82. 
 
 Dhanani has a good chance of being named leader of opposition by Congress because party stalwarts like Siddharth Patel, Arjun Modhwadia, Shaktisinh Gohil and Dr Tushar Chaudhary had lost in the assembly elections held in December 2017. Now, Congress has to make a choice between him and other contenders like Mohansinh Rathwa and Kunwarji Bavaliya. On the issue of atrocities on dalits, Hardik said the government is to be blamed for the disturbances in Maharashtra. 
 
 “Dalits are not getting justice and their voice is being suppressed. The government does not want young leaders like Jignesh Mevani from voicing their opinions.” Hardik also visited Lajpore Central Jail to meet PAAS activists Chandresh Kakadia, Maulik Nasin, Rishi Desai and Jignesh Garasiya, who were held for indulging in violence and put behind bars some time ago.
