NEW DELHI: Just a couple of weeks prior to   11, all of Sunrisers Hyderabad’s well-laid plans for the season were sent for a toss when the ‘Sandpaper Gate’ controversy broke in South Africa. The biggest fall-out of all that transpired in South Africa was the ban handed out to  , who had led the Sunrisers to the IPL 2016 crown in 2016.

 
 The man to step up to the plate to replace Warner has been his Trans-Tasman rival  . The Kiwi captain has stepped up to the plate brilliantly so far this season, both with the willow and with his leadership. Williamson has notched up 410 runs in 10 games at an average of 51.25 with five half-centuries and has also remained ice-cool as a skipper on the field especially while defending low targets.
 
 “Kane is an astute leader. He has transitioned into his role as the Sunrisers skipper very well. It’s easy to forget that he is quite young as an international cricketer but he has a very wise head on his shoulders. He has displayed the ability to handle pressure,” Sunrisers coach Tom Moody said speaking about Williamson.
 
 Williamson and Warner are poles apart as cricketers — while one is ice, the other is all fire. That hasn’t changed the way the Sunrisers have gone about their business. “Every captain is different in international cricket. Warner had his own methods and was very successful and even won us the title in 2016. Williamson and Warner have different styles to leadership,” Moody added about the Sunrisers captaincy.
 
 On Williamson’s passion during IPL-11, Moody said, “Kane the Test captain is slightly different from Kane the T20 captain. The match situations are different and that’s why one sees a much more passionate skipper on the field.”
 
 Williamson’s leadership has lifted them into virtually the Playoffs, whether it can set up a 2016 encore, only time will tell.
