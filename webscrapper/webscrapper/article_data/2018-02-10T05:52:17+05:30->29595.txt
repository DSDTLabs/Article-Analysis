MUMBAI: Chembur resident  , who committed suicide after jumping off the fifth floor of   building on Thursday, was not eligible for remission for another five years, said officials. 

 Raote, who was convicted and sentenced to 26 years in jail for stabbing his sister-in-law to death 44 times in 2003, was in jail for 12 years and six months and earned leave six times during his term. Usually, said state officials, a convict serving life sentence is considered for remission after he spends 14 years behind bars, but in Raote's case, since it was a henious crime and that too against a woman, his sentence could have been reduced only after he spent 17-18 years in jail. 
 
 Raote spent time in prison since 2004 and was sent to Paithan open jail in 2014, where convicts with good behaviour are sent. "The jail authorities had sent a proposal to the government to consider Raote for remission after 22 years in jail. A reply was pending," said a senior jail official.
 
 Raote, who was on furlough since on January 10 for 28 days, had come to Mantralaya on Thursday to submit a letter to the home department pleading that injustice had been meted out to him and that his jail term be reduced. Thursday was the last day of his furlough. But home department officials said they had not received any letter from Raote seeking reduction of sentence.
 
 There there was heavy police presence in Mantralaya on Friday. Policemen in uniform and mufti were seen checking on citizens and asking if they needed any assistance.
