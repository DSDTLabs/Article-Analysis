JAMSHEDPUR: Meat sellers and buyers here fear that prices of mutton may rise sharply if the stalemate over unlicensed   and shops remains unresolved for some more days.

 An official of the Jamshedpur Meat Shop Owners’ Association on Friday said, “If the government does not sort out the problems arising out of the crackdown on illegal abattoirs in time, there will be a shortage of meat in the city. Many small-time traders may take advantage of this and start clandestinely slaughtering animals at home.” He added, “Our organisation cannot keep an eye on each and every meat seller.”
 
 Some traders said with the   round the corner, they might have to buy meat from other states. “Six of my customers have given me advance money to buy meat for wedding receptions that fall on different dates after April 7.
 
 If the deadlock over the crackdown does not end, I will have to purchase meat from Purulia in neighbouring West Bengal,” a meat seller from Uliyan (Kadma) here. “My customers are ready to take meat brought from Purulia,” he added. 
 
 Another seller added, “Customers are also willing to pay extra to fulfill their need for meat. What they want is fresh meat in time so that they do not have problems in hosting wedding receptions.” 
 
 Many meat traders said secret slaughtering of animals might take place in remote areas, especially those bordering West Bengal. One of them said, “Till last week a kilogram of mutton would cost Rs 500. Now, it has gone beyond Rs 550.” 
 
 On the other hand, district officials have been strictly following the government’s order to shut down unlicensed slaughterhouses and meat shops. “This kind of crackdown is going on everywhere in the state,” an official said, adding, “There are no restrictions on legal slaughterhouses and meat shops.”
