CHENNAI: Tractor and   make   & Mahindra is charting out a fresh strategy for  , by going alone.
The plan is to set up a new Mahindra China subsidiary because unlike automobiles there is no mandatory local JV requirement in tractors and farm equipment.
 
 This is part of M&M’s plans of targeting big global markets like the US, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, China, Turkey and parts of Europe through its new global acquisitions. The farm machine foray will be through machinery its recently acquired global brands Turkish company Hisarlar, Finnish harvestor company Sampo Rosenlew and Japanese agri implements business Mitsubishi Agri Machinery.
 
 Sources say currently the company top brass are in planning and discussions over its farm machinery strategy. The idea is to work with a China cost structure without which it is almost impossible to succeed there. When contacted, the Mahindra & Mahindra spokesman refused to comment.
 
 Although Hisarlar, Sampo Rosenlew and Mitsubishi Agri Machinery don’t have any presence in China they are well-known brands in different global markets including parts of Europe and Africa. “Going it alone in China means Mahindra will need to invest in creating a network as well as building its brand and investments will be made based on feasibility and evolution of a plan,” said a source.
 
 The company expects to stitch up its China farm machinery strategy over the next 12 months which will tie in with its aggressive global farm machinery plans as well. M&M's farm machinery revenue target is 20% of total revenue by 2019, up from 5% in 2015. 
 
 The overall plan is to build a   business through Sampo in Finland (except rice harvestors which will be handled by Mitsubishi) and use Mitsubishi for rice value chain products like  , light weight tractors and harvestors. Globally the farm machinery business is a $100 billion market.
