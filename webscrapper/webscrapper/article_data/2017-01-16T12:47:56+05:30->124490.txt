ATTARI: On the second day of his tour of border villages, Aam Aadmi Pary (AAP) national convener   on Sunday interacted with locals and blamed successive Congress and SAD-BJP governments for their hardships.

 The Delhi CM, addressing a rally in Amritsar’s Attari village, claimed that he would change their lives by promoting agro-based industry and promised a special economic package for the development of border areas. “Badals and Amrinder have ruined the border districts of Punjab by never giving heed to their woes,” he said.
 
 Kejriwal described agro-based industry as the need of the hour, especially in border districts of Punjab. “AAP is committed to resolving the issues of people of border areas,” he said.
 
 At the same time, Kejriwal said he would bring back industrial units that had shifted from Punjab to neighbouring states. “Industrial units will be brought back with tax incentives and a pre-condition of giving 80% jobs to Punjabis,” he said.
 
 Kejriwal then trained his guns at Punjab minister  , saying that the SAD leader would be put behind bars if AAP is voted to power.
