Vijayawada: For the past few months rumours are rife that the notorious Pardhi   entered Andhra Pradesh and were committing heinous crimes like robberies and dacoity.

 The rumours reached such a level people in villages were attacking newcomers suspecting them to be members of the Pardhi gang. On May 3, a 25-year-old man, who was mentally-ill, was attacked and injured in Chennuru village of Kadapa. Similarly, a Bihari man was attacked by people suspected to be part of the notorious gang in Nandigama town in Krishna district on Monday. 
 
 District police in a press release have issued a statement that all speculations were false and warned that anyone spreading false rumours would be prosecuted under IT Act. Other superintendents of districts like East Godavari and Vizianagaram too held press conferences and urged people to not take law in their own hands and said there were no intelligence to suggest any presence of Pardhi gangs in the state. “If any one has information about such activity one can come forward and give it to the police but no one should take law into their own hands,” East Godavari SP Vishal Gunni said in a selfie video. 
 
 Krishna district officials said they have also filed cases against miscreants circulating unsubstantiated rumours on social media causing law and order issues. Cops also arrested them and sent them to judicial remand.
 
 These rumours have gone viral across the state and some people in the Rayalaseema region even went to the extent of forming teams in Valluru, Nandalur, Chennuru, Badvel, Proddatur, Mydukur and Chintakomma Dinne mandals, to conduct night patrolling in the villages.
 
 Members of the Pardhi gang belong to tribal community and they reside in Pune and Nanded district in Maharashtra. Ironically, Kadapa SP Attada Babujee too clarified that there was no authentic information of the Pardhi gang in the district.
