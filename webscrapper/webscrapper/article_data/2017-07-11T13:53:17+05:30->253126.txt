PATNA: A   will soon be established at   (PMCH) with an estimated expenditure of Rs 8 crore. While the Centre will bear 75% of the project cost, the remaining 25% will be borne by the state government. The unit is proposed to be set up on the third floor, just above the emergency unit of  .
 
  Sources said the Centre has already released the first instalment and work on the proposed burn unit would start once the state government releases its share of money.
  
  “The unit will have 16 beds, including four beds in the intensive care unit. Every bed will have a central pipeline for oxygen along with a monitor to check oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, heart rate and other indicators,” said a source.
  
  Head of PMCH’s plastic surgery department Dr   said the unit will be fully air-conditioned. “The unit will have air chamber or weight-distributing burn beds. It uses a series of interlinked inflatable air chambers where air can freely distribute itself into different chambers conforming to the shape of the patient’s body,” he said, adding a similar burn unit will also come up at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital at Bhagalpur.
  
  Dr Choudhary said the PMCH administration has been urged to restrict the entry of people to this special unit as burn patients have a high risk of infection. “I have seen such special units in different parts of the world and would like to develop this unit accordingly. The unit will have a glass window to help visitors see the patients. A special chamber will be there where doctors, nurses and paramedical staff will have to disinfect themselves before entering the unit,” he said.
  
  As of now, there are 56 beds in the general ward and six beds in the ICU of the burn ward. However, the posts of an associate professor, an assistant professor and two senior residents are still vacant in the unit.
