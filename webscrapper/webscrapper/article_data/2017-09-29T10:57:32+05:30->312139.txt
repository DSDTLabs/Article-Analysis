PUNE: The   will focus on   of newborns in a special campaign to inject some momentum into the flagging enrolment in the state.

 Only 46% of the 0-5 years age group is covered under Aadhaar, and the special drive is an attempt to improve the numbers. To further this endeavour, the government has issued guidelines to district and state hospitals.
 
 State IT secretary VK Gautam told TOI that this age group has been the most neglected. “We will start enrolment at the hospital directly,“ Gautam said.
 
 Recently at the Osmanabad district women's hospital, a newborn was registered for Aadhaar just six minutes after her birth. The parents got the online birth certificate and an Aadhaar number from  , said the district officials.
 
 A state government directive stated that tablet-based enrolment kits are being given to MahaOnline or other state-appointed enrolment agencies at certain government hospitals and health centres. “We will have separate operators at district hospitals,“ Gautam added.
 
 According to the UIDAI, only 25% of children in the age bracket of 0-5 years have Aadhaar cards in the country and efforts are taken across the country to improve this number. Of the 10.5 annual births in the state, 5 lakh are recorded in rural and district hospitals, as per officials.
 
 “The child's enrolment will be attached to the Aadhaar number of either parent,“ a UIDAI official said. “The process is simple, with most adults having enrolled,“ the official said.
