VADODARA: Nearly 200   of the city participated in the   organized by the   of the   (IMA) to protest and create awareness among common man regarding the ill effects of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill. 

 The three km rally which started from SSG Hospital passed through Kalaghoda circle, Dairy Den, railway station area before returning back to the state-run hospital. 
 
 “IMA had given the nation-wide call to organise the same event at the same time across all the 1,700 branches of the association to protest and create awareness on the draconian provisions of NMC,” said IMA Vadodara president Dr Nutan Shah. 
 
 IMA had given the protest call against the bill that seeks to replace the Medical Council of India (MCI) with a new body terming the centre’s move as anti-poor, anti-people, non-representative, undemocratic and anti-federal in character. 
 
 “Among other things, the bill seeks to allow practitioners of ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy, to practice modern medicine once they complete a short term “bridge” course but ironically it will make it compulsory for medical students to undergo an exit test,” said Dr Samir Shah, scientific secretary of IMA. 
 
 IMA is opposing the bill stating that it will “cripple” the functioning of medical professionals by making them completely answerable to the bureaucracy and non-medical administrators. 
 
 The draft bill allows private medical colleges to charge at will, IMA has said, adding that the bill also has provision whereby the commission will have a government-nominated chairman and members and the board members will be selected by a search committee under the cabinet secretary.
 
 “Our focus is now to create public awareness on the undemocratic provisions of the bill which will not only affect doctors and medical students but will also adversely affect patients at large,” he said.
