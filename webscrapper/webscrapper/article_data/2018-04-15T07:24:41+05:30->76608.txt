PUNE: Scientists and students here on Saturday expressed concern over the prominence being given to mythology rather than scientific thinking in the country. 

 Extending support to the global March for Science movement, a rally was organised in the city where students expressed the need for developing a scientific temper in society. "The socio-economic condition of the country has led people to blindly follow mythology and tradition to the detriment of science. This has been the way of life for ages and it's time for the scientific fraternity to speak up," said Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER) student Akash Mukherjee.Around 100 people, including scientists, teachers, students and volunteers, gathered at   bridge to extend support to the movement. 
 
 Satyajit Rath, a senior scientist participating in the march, said, "Power of reasoning and questioning has taken a back seat in the country. More prominence is being given to mythology rather reasoning." Surendra Ghaskadbi, senior scientist, Agharkar Research Institute, said that the student community has now awakened since the last march on August 9 last year. "Since the last march, students have become more aware of the wrongs happening around them. The scientific student community has united to voice their concern," he said.
