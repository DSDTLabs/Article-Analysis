VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Friday evening conducted another razing around the state   in the   area to clear land for the   hub planned in the area. The drive was a part of a series of   by the VMC in the area.

 Civic body officials said that 22 dwellings, five shops and some other structures were razed in the area around the Damajirao Dharamshala . These were encroaching on the district panchayat land that has been handed over to the civic body for the station area redevelopment plan that includes the urban transport hub.
 
 VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that the hub would come up on a space of 1.2lakh square feet. “The land we have presently is sufficient and we will not need to acquire any private land in the area,” he said. The demolition of Pathik Bhavan that was in the possession of the district panchayat had to be stopped as the Gujarat high court had granted a stay on the razing of the structure. The partly razed structure stands at the site today.
