INDORE:Members of E-cab Operators and Drivers’ Association in Indore are planning to  . They have also planned to launch a protest since   to compete for customers. 

 The members have demanded that both cab companies should stop incentive payouts and stick to the ideal fare of Rs12 per kilometre. They would soon meet the regional transport officer   for his intervention in the matter. 
 
  “Due to decrease in fare by Ola and Uber owners and drive attached with the companies are not able to recover even the maintenance cost of their vehicle. Therefore, we want a hike in the fare to earn our livelihood,” said Nitin Yadav, founding member of the association. 
 
 Drivers are not able to spend on servicing of vehicles, tyres and even insurance, he said. 
 
 He also said that these cab companies are continuing with a fixed incentive limit, which depends on the number of bookings, but with increase in number of vehicles it has become very difficult to meet the daily targets. 
 
 The numbers of vehicles attached with the companies have also increased in past one year. Presently, more than 1200 vehicles are attached with them.
