THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The ethics committee of the   (WB) will soon conduct a probe into the corruption allegations raised by   minister   in the second phase of   ( ). In the controversial speech, the PWD minister had alleged that World Bank was responsible for mismanagement and corruption in KSTP –II.

 A team of high-level officials of ethics committee of WB is expected to arrive in the coming weeks to conduct an inquiry as the WB has reportedly taken a serious note of the allegations.
 
 Though leaders from the ruling front are keeping mum on the issue, opposition leader   has demanded chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s apology on the racist remarks made by PWD Minister G Sudhakaran against World Bank team leader Bernard Aritua.
 
 Chennithala issued the statement in wake of reports that World Bank has sent a letter to Union finance minister Arun Jaitely on the issue.
 
 “Such a racist remark was unexpected from a leader like G Sudhakaran. This had eroded the reputation of the state at the global level. Malayalis world-wide are insulted by his statements. Ours is a society which has taken a strong stand against racism. We have a history of seeing everyone as equals, irrespective of their caste, gender and race. Indians, especially Malayalis, welcome all cultures. This was dented by the irresponsible statement of the minister,” said Chennithala.
 
 “Senior officials of World Bank ethics committee vice-president, south Asian vice-president and human resources vice-president have sent letter to Union finance minister Arun Jaitely. This will affect many of our projects, including KSTP. So the chief minister must apologize on the remarks,” Chennithala said.
 
 BJP state president Kummanam Rajashekharan has also warned of serious consequences owing to the racist remarks of Sudhakaran. 
 
 “The chief minister must make his stand clear on the issue. The government must intervene to make sure that the World Bank funds are not cancelled due to the controversy,” he said.
