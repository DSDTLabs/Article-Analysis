Her absence from the big screen despite a promising start with her memorable performance in ' ' surprised everyone but   says 'the gap' was well planned. 

 The 27-year-old actress is back in the ring with two interesting projects. She will soon be seen in Akshay Kumar- starrer ' ' and ' ' with former co-star  .
 
  
  
 Bhumi had to gain kilos to play Sandhya in her debut project and the actress says she had to get back to her normal self before signing on something new. "The gap between my films didn't bother me. There was always a plan that I will take at least eight months to shed the kilos I gained for 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha'. I was busy getting back to being Bhumi," she told . 
 
 The actress says the difference between her first and second film was never a problem for her and as she was busy enjoying the fame she gained after her debut. "Nothing changed drastically in my life due to that gap as in any case I wouldn't have been able to do any film. It really didn't bother me at all. It probably did shift my life back by a few months. But I was normal. It never came across as a problem for me. It was all good as I was enjoying the success I gained after 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha'".
 
 Bhumi says she is still 'discovering' how she wants her career to shape up. "I am discovering myself as a career oriented person. But as far as I understand myself, I like to complete one project and then switch on to another. I want to give my 100 per cent to a film." 
 
 However, she is also fine with taking up multiple assignments if she gets good roles. "I am also an extremely greedy actor. So, if there comes a point in my career when I have to work on more than one film, I will do it. Life changes everyday so I am okay with it."
