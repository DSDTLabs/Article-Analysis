LUCKNOW: The mood was set and Lucknow was ready to grasp the   ( ) as the   began at   on Friday.

 On the first day of the five-day festival, readings were made from two special books that reflect strong Awadhi-French ties.
 
 On display were life-size panels with paintings and photos from the yesteryear commissioned on Awadh by French officers.
 
 Impressions from the natural history collection of Claude Martin and drone camera images of La Martiniere College set by drone imaging enthusiast Mohsina Mirza welcomed visitors to the festival.
 
 Engaging storytelling began as educator Valentina Trivedi read excerpts from Allan Sealy’s novel Trotter-Nama which has disguised references to the author’s school La Martiniere College.
 
 Noor Khan, who possesses a 99-year-old French cookbook, perhaps the oldest in Urdu, read out pieces from it to the delight of the audience. Written by Syed Ahmad Ali Ambalavi, the book has more than 400 recipes written about in a conversational style.
 
 Among the array of stalls that gave varied food and cultural experiences to visitors, the festival also had a special stall by a hearing impaired young artist.
 
 Neha Kaul, who holds a master’s in fine arts from Lucknow University, paints stones in exquisite colours and designs. Her art has attracted a number of visitors. The 31-year-old has also put up other craft items.
 
 Pulling crowds to their installation, Delhi-based organisation CREA has set up a photo studio which aims to break gender stereotypes, one photograph at a time.
 
 Cut-outs dispelling gender notions have been placed for people to get photographed with.
 
 In the evening, against the backdrop of   La Martiniere College, the inaugural dance performance took place. An Odissi performance by dance group Nrityagram had people hooked on in appreciation.
