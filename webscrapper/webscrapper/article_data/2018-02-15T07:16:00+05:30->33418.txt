GURUGRAM: Residents of   have written to MCG demanding the  , installation of LED streetlights and deployment of traffic marshals in the area.

 According to residents,   Road in Sector 69, which is being reconstructed after residents made several appeals to the authorities, is in poor condition due to the movement of heavy vehicles on the stretch. 
 
 The condition of the road started deteriorating three years ago after traffic, especially heavy vehicles from the Kherki Daula side that were supposed to take the SPR, took Darbaripur road instead and got stuck at Ram Veer ki Dhani. 
 
 “Darbaripur road is being reconstructed with reinforced concrete now. Work started only last week,” said Jasvinder Singh, a resident.
 
 Residents said they have been living in a “dust bowl”. “We are suffering due to the dust from the broken road. The uneven road also damages our vehicles,” Singh said.
 
 Somika  , a resident of GPL Heights, which lies right next to Darbaripur road, said: “There is an urgent need of stormwater drains to be laid along this road. The road is raised higher than the houses along it, so there are chances of rainwater entering our residential complex.”
 
 Residents said they have also written to senior MCG officials, asking them to replace CFL streetlights with LED variants and deploy traffic cops on the road. 
 
 Since MCG has started work on the road, one of the carriageways has been closed down, leading to chaos as traffic from both sides share the same carriageway. “The presence of traffic cops on the stretch may help reduce congestion,” Chandhok said.
