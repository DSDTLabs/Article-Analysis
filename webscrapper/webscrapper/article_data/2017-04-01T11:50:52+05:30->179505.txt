NEW DELHI: The 46 ministers in Yogi Adityanath’s government will have an added responsibility apart from handling their respective ministries — they will also be in charge of a district or two each to ensure that the government is “visible” on the ground, and MLAs’ voices reach Lucknow.
 
  The chief minister plans to roll out such a governance model in  , state’s Power Minister   told ET.
  
  “The CM wants to remain connected to each assembly seat and district,” Sharma said. There are 75 districts in UP covering 403 assembly constituencies — 325 of them have   MLAs. The plan is to make a minister in charge of one or two districts, to whom BJP MLAs in that district take forward their requests and also convey the complaints of citizens.
  
  “The minister will monitor the district so that the government is visible. All works of the government should reach the ground level and the minister will take immediate cognisance of any problems highlighted by MLAs and take it up with the department in Lucknow — basically this will improve the delivery mechanism,” said Sharma. There’s no district in UP now which does not have a BJP MLA, and 34 districts have only BJP MLAs. But out of the 325 BJP MLAs, 209 are first-timers.
  
  “Having a minister in charge of a district as a sounding board should help…most ministers are MLAs anyway, and will invariably be put in charge of their home district,” a state BJP functionary said, adding the step would lead to a seamless coordination between the party and state government.
