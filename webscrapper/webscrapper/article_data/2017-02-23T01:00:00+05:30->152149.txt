The lawns of   have turned into a movie studio for the last three weeks, and the reason for this filmi hawa is 'Nexus', the annual cultural fest of the college. The theme of this year’s fest is  , and members of the  , who organize the fest, seem to be having a lot of fun with it. 

  In most DU colleges, the fest organizing committee usually asks the college’s fine arts society to make posters for the fest, but Venky's organizing committee has decided to ditch the usual way. Instead, they are acting, dancing and making music videos on popular Bollywood tracks to publicize the event.

  On a recent visit to the college, we found the team of around 50-odd members dancing to  , It’s The Time To Disco and Kajra Re. Manya Batra, the vice-president of the society, was teaching them the steps to 'Kala Chashma', and while some asked, 'How do we do this?', 'Can we do it this way?', others seemed to be just going with the flow and enjoying the dance session. After 'Kala Chashma', it was time for 'Kajra Re'. And since everyone knew the very popular step of this song, it did not take long for the group to master the routine. Radhika Mehta, another member of the organizing committee, recorded the final act to be uploaded online.

  Manya told us, "Our theme this year is Bollywood, and everything from our decor to marketing is according to the theme. Bollywood is something we all love, and making these videos while working on the fest is a lot of fun." Pranjal Singla, the president of the society, added, "We have been working really hard on this theme. Nexus 2017 is the filmi fest of the year, and working in this filmi way is fun."
