NEW DELHI:   today blamed "tampering of electronic voting machines" (EVM) for her   being decimated in the Uttar Pradesh elections.

 "Either the EVMs did not accept votes other than BJP, or the votes of other parties have gone to   in the EVMs," Mayawati said after counting leads are showing the BJP sweeping the state elections. 
 
 "Looks like voting machines have not accepted any vote from another party than BJP", she added.
 
 The BSP, which is showing a lead in only 17 seats of 403, was expected to get at least 80 votes according to most exit polls. The BJP is ahead in a whopping 306 seats while SP-Congress is in second place at 73.
 
 The BSP chief challenged BJP president Amit Shah asking him to conduct polls again, adding she will be proven correct.
 
 "Most votes in the Muslim majority constituencies have gone to BJP, (that) makes it evident that voting machines were manipulated," she added.
 
 "If you are honest, ask the poll panel to re-conduct polls with ballot paper (instead of EVM," she said.
 
 "Even in the US, it has been shown that EVMs are not reliable," she said, adding that "the BJP did not dare do this in Punjab" where the Congress is winning a more-than-comfortable majority.
  
 She alleged "EVM tampering" in Uttarakhand as well, which is also being won by the BJP, in what many are seeing as an upset. 
 
 Mayawati said she has written to the Election Commission demanding the immediate stoppage of counting and the declaration of results in UP.
