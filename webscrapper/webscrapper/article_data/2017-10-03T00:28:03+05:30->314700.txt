Coimbatore: A 33-year-old man afflicted with hernia has been coming all the way to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) from Sathyamangalam to give urine and blood samples for the past three days but to no avail.

 The hospital authorities have been refusing to take his samples since Saturday, saying that he came after 12 and the lab closes at noon on public holidays. However, after the patient began speaking to media, hospital authorities took his samples. 
 
 The patient, Govindharaj, said he has been suffering from hernia for the past four years. “I had been going to some private hospitals and clinics in Sathyamangalam for treatment, where doctors suggested for surgery. Since I am poor, I came to CMCH for the surgery,” said the patient, who is a daily wage labourer. 
 
 Govindharaj said he came on Saturday to the hospital where a doctor had told him that they needed to do a CT scan and required his blood and urine to be tested too. 
 
 Govindharaj said that on Saturday, he was sent away from the laboratory because technicians claimed that it was closed. “I came again on Sunday and there was a huge queue outside the lab. At 12 noon, they said the lab was closed and could not take my blood and urine samples despite me waiting there for more than an hour,” he said. On Monday, when he had turned up for the third time, the laboratory was closed at noon again.“They are making me travel up and down all the way from Sathyamangalam with so much pain,” he said.
 
 The patient’s urine and blood samples were later to be collected. “We usually close the labs for outpatients and blood donation at 1pm, and since it was public holidays and long weekend, the labs were closed at 12pm from Friday. Since hernia is an elective surgery, we gave importance to emergency inpatients,” said Dr A Soundaravel.
