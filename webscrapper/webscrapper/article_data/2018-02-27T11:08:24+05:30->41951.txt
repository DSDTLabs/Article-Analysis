NEW DELHI: The joint forum of Delhi government employees on Monday claimed that   and his deputy, Manish  , were part of a   that led to the alleged   on chief secretary   by two AAP MLAs and called for action against them.

 Adopting a resolution to this effect, the officers appealed to LG Anil Baijal to take action against them. “Instead of apologising and admitting their mistake ... the CM and (the) deputy CM are in a denial mode. This shows that they were a part of the conspiracy, and as they are specifically identified in the FIR, we appeal to LG and commissioner of police to take action as per law against them,” the resolution stated. 
 
 The latest development puts a question mark on the possibility of a reconciliation between the two sides. At a meeting, the forum deliberated upon the offer of talks extended by the CM’s emissary, social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam. Emerging from the meeting, the officers made it clear that for any kind of talks to take place, Kejriwal and Sisodia must apologise. 
 
 The bureaucrats also sought steps to ensure “personal safety” and “dignity” of officers as a precondition for holding any dialogue. A government official, however, said any apology from the chief minister was out of the question as the matter was under investigation and two AAP MLAs had already been arrested in the case. 
 
 Legal experts are of the view that an apology may go against the two MLAs facing trial.
 
 Minister Gautam said: “The ball is now in the court of the bureaucrats who should give a positive response to end the tussle in the interest of the public. The government has already taken a step towards rapprochement. The government is like a family and we all are members of the family. It is a reciprocal relationship and both sides need to maintain it.” 
 
 The officers, meanwhile, reiterated that they would remain in contact with the political executive through notes and file notings only.
