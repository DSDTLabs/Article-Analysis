MELBOURNE:   - sporting a midnight blue playsuit - blasted her way into the Australian Open quarterfinals for the first time in six years. The Dane, flaunting a bold, aggressive game, slammed 25 winners in the course of her 6-3, 6-0 63-minute win over  .

 
 The 27-year-old refused to compare her form to seven years ago when she made her only semifinals here. “I’m in a good place. I think I’m hitting the ball well. Everything has been going well the last year and a half,” said Wozniacki, who faced just one breakpoint against the Slovak, seeded 19. “Serving well has been the key to my form these last 12 months, when I am serving well, it takes the pressure off my return games.”
 
 Wozniacki, the No.2 seed, who could take over the top spot in the rankings if she reaches the semifinals, said the   and   were an inspiration. “We can always improve. That’s the fun thing and the most frustrating thing about tennis, you can always get better,” the striking Dane said. “You can see that even with Roger or Rafa, who are incredible players, some of the best players ever. They come back year after year, and they play even better, though you think that it’s almost impossible. You’re like, how? It inspires everyone else to step it up and play better. I’m always thinking if they can get better, then I can too. I have a long way to go.”
 
 Wozniacki, who announced her engagement to former NBA star, the ex-New York Knicks forward David Lee in November last year, will play Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro in the last eight. The Dane, who stands at 5 ft 10’ in her tennis shoes, leads the head-to-head 4-2, but the 5 ft 4’ Navarro, 29, won their last meeting on clay in Madrid last year.
 
 “Obviously hard courts are a little different,” Wozniacki said of their last meeting. “But we’ve had a lot of tough encounters on hard courts as well.”
