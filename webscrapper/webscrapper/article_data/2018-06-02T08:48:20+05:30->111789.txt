BATHINDA: With very little produce brought by farmers to the cities, prices of vegetables registered a hike in   and other towns of Malwa. Some vegetables were sold at nearly double the usual rate on Thursday. However, milk supplies were not disturbed as much on the first day of the strike by the farmers from June 1 to 10. Supply of milk was disrupted at Faridkot, Muktsar and  .

 At   village of Bathinda, a milk van was stopped by members of farmer organisation BKU ( ) and the milk was distributed free of cost in the village.   village in Bathinda, who had grown vegetables on one acre, preferred not to go to the town to sell his produce. He sold the vegetables in his village. He said, “In routine I sell vegetables for about Rs 600 per day, but today I earned Rs 1,000 by selling same quantity of vegetables locally.”
 
 On the other hand, there was not much impact in Patiala. The protest call given by the farmers failed to have any substantial impact on supply of vegetables and milk in the district. While, there was some panic among local residents regarding the strike, but as the day unfolded vegetables and milk was easily available in the market. In addditon, the supply of milk to homes remained uninterrupted all through the day.
 
 There were some reports that some commission agents had tried to hoard vegetables such as onions and potatoes to cash on the farmers’ strike but as it remained ineffective in the district, and their efforts fizzled out during the day.
