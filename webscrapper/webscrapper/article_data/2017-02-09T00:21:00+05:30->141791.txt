Bhopal: Over 112 government higher secondary schools in Bhopal affiliated to Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education (MPBSE) on Tuesday began pre-board examination for classes 10 and 12.

 More than 10,000 students are appearing in the exam. Speaking to TOI, District Education Officer (DEO) Dharmendra Kumar Sharma said the pre-board exams are being conducted to help students be more competent, know where they stand and get a better perspective of board exams. “The word examination sounds scary to students and sometimes parents as well due to which they get stressed and tend to panic. Pre-boards are conducted to cut down the stress of students and give them an idea about board exams. This helps students to prepare well for final exams,” said Sharma.
 
 The DEO said the evaluation of papers will be done simultaneously and students would be shown their answer copies so that they can learn from their mistakes. “After the pre-board the student will themselves zero in on the mistakes they have made. Schools will be providing them the answer copies, for which I have instructed all the principals to make the arrangements accordingly,” he added.
 
 The question papers have been set on the pattern of final board exams and conducted as per a common timetable in all the schools. The exams will conclude on February 14. Besides, for those who fail in pre-board exams, special classes of one hour daily will be organised to help them prepare for mains. Madhya Board of Secondary Education (MPBSE) final examination is all set to begin from the first week of March. As many as 10 lakh students from Class 10 and 12 will appear for 2017 board examinations in the state.
