LUDHIANA: Three days after TOI carried a news story on 210 parole jumpers from seven jails,   of India (EC) has asked the police to take measures and carry out drive to arrest them.

 “We have taken cognizance of the TOI report and have asked police to take swift action on it,” said V K Singh, Punjab chief electoral officer, when contacted.
 
 TOI in a news report on January 12 edition had highlighted that as per RTI plea, 210 convicts in murder, drug peddling and rape cases, have jumped parole and many of them have not returned to jails for decades. Social activists had raised questions on security threat from them to peaceful holding of elections in the state as they suspected that they might carry out peddling and indulge in political fights during elections.
 
 SP City-I Jalandhar Jasbir Singh, who confirmed to have received the letter from EC on those convicts who have jumped parole, said already a special drive has been initiated to arrest them.
 
 Police officials mentioned that along with the letter, EC has attached the news report of TOI. Meanwhile, RTI activist who had gathered the details of convicts who had jumped parole from seven jails welcomed the EC order.
 
 “It is a good step that the Election Commission has taken cognizance of the news report. I hope there will be action on ground so that miscreants do not carry out peddling and other acts during elections,” said Ravi Sharma, RTI activist.
 
 The data collected under RTI from seven jails suggested that some of the parole jumpers include murder convicts who are missing since 1980s and 1990s. The data points out that of the 210 convicts, 70 are involved in murder cases followed by 69 in drug peddling and eight in rape cases. It suggests that among the seven jails, most number of parole jumpers are from   (54), Ludhiana and Kapurthala Central Jails (46),   (34),   (18), Maximum Security Nabha Jail (10) and Women Jail Ludhiana (2).
