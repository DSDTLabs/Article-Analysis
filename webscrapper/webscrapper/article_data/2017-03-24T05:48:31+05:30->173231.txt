LUCKNOW: The closure of   and   has crippled the business in the city. In the two days since the shops were closed, a loss of over Rs 5 crore has been reported.

 As per the butchers’ association, the city has an estimated demand of 90,000 kilos of buffalo meat each day. As many as 600 animals, weighing around 160 kg each, were being butchered at the various allegedly unauthorized slaughterhouses on a daily basis to meet this demand.
 
 “Buffalo meat sells at Rs 200 per kg which means a revenue of almost Rs 2 crore per day. So closure of two days roughly means a loss of Rs 4 crore,” said Shafeen Qureshi, member of All India Jamiat-ul-Quresh association. Most of the buffalo meat shops also sell mutton. With them closed now, there is just about 50% of mutton available against the daily demand of 2,000 kilos, leading to a daily loss of over Rs 40 lakh per day.
 
 Naeem, a butcher shop owner, who mostly supplies raw meat to the shack restaurants of Old City, said he had suffered a loss of over Rs 60,000. “I supply meat to over half-a-dozen outlets in Nakkhas and Hussainabad. Since no animal was slaughtered, we couldn’t get any meat. So the restaurants also suffered losses in their business,” he said.
 
 Almost all the big and small restaurants of the Old City sell dishes of buffalo meat. Now, they are forced to either remain closed or to alter their menu. Shariq Ahmed, a member of the  , said, “There are over 50 restaurants, big and small, which sell buffalo meat in the area. The business in all these shops has been hit, causing them substantial losses.”
