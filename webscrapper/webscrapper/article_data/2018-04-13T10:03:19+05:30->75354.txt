LUCKNOW: The   will observe the Black Day on April 17 to protest rising crimes against women under the   rule in the country. 

 "Be it the Unnao rape case or the story of Asifa, the eight-year-old girl in Kathua who was gangraped for seven days and killed, the BJP has failed to ensure safety to women in the country. The graph of crimes against women has gone up in India and BJP ruled states," said   chief Sushmita Dev.
 
 Dev reached Lucknow on Thursday morning to launch a protest march against the Yogi government which has drawn flak in the Unnao rape case. 
 
 Raising anti-government slogans, the women brigade broke bangles on the road to show their anger against the failure of the government to control law and order.
 
 The protesters demanded the immediate arrest of BJP MLA  , who is an accused in the Unnao rape case. UP Congress Committee and Youth Congress workers also joined the protest. The two-hour demonstration ended with the detention of the protesters. 
 
 "During elections, BJP had coined the slogan - Band karo ab mahila pe atyachar, abki baar   sarkar. What happened to that promise  ? Is this the way your party treats women  ? The incidents of crime have proven that the promise was a 'jumla' (joke)," Dev said.
