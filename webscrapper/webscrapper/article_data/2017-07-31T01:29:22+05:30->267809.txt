NEW DELHI: The capital saw another day of humid weather with light drizzle reported in parts of NCR on Sunday. The maximum temperature was recorded at 34.1 degrees Celsius, which is around normal for the season. 

 Met officials forecast temperatures to drop by 2-3 degrees Celsius in the next 48 hours with light to moderate showers likely on Monday and some parts of NCR on Tuesday. 
 
 Light drizzle was reported from south and central Delhi between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Sunday. But   remained high, oscillating between 62% and 82%. The minimum temperature was recorded at 28 degrees Celsius, one notch above normal. 
 
 Officials at Regional Weather Forecasting Centre said the advancement of the   trough northwards was likely to bring showers on Monday, though it would likely to be less than what was earlier forecast. “A majority of the activity has shifted to the foothills and parts of Punjab. Temperature is likely to drop, but humidity will remain high,” said an official.
