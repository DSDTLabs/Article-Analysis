CHENNAI: The   drifting from the   on stage had the audience in thrall.

 H Vishwas, 14, held the crowd at   in the city under a spell during a 90-minute performance on the fourth night of Navratri.
 
 Music watchers in the city say Vishwas, recently named the recipient of the   Award, is not only stepping up as a young Carnatic instrumentalist but also bringing more attention to an instrument that few musicians choose to master.
 
 The Class X student of PS Senior Secondary School started playing the instrument when he was seven.He may have other accolades like the State Kalai Iamani Award in his bag, but Vishwas says mandolin was not his first choice of instrument.
 
 “I started playing keyboard when I was very young. But after trying out the mandolin on my mother's suggestion, I decided to pursue it seriously ,“ says the teenager, who is currently under the tutelage of the Gottuvadyam exponent, Allam Durga Prasad.
 
 From singing at school annual days, small gatherings and temple halls, Vishwas is now gearing for the December carnatic season to hit the Sabhas. “I can see so many different artistes at one place,“ he says, talking of the Margazhi carnatic festival.
 
 But to get there, he has to saddle responsibilities of school and exams, balancing it with his daily practice. “I have to balance both. Mandolin is an instrument you have to practice every single day to not lose touch“.
 
 Following the style of his teacher and the work of the late maestro Mandolin U Srinivas, he expresses a strong interest in carrying forward the orthodox carnatic style, through his instrument.
 
 “There is a lot of mix and fusion, but I love the work of musicians who follow the pure carnatic music style,“ he says, naming carnatic vocalists like Kunnakudi Balamuralikrishna and Abhishek Raghuram as his musical inspirations.
 
 The youngster who is busy this Navratri season, will go back to perform at Kapaleeshwarar temple where he started out.
