JAIPUR: While the curfew was lifted from   in  , section 144 will continue in parts of the district. District collector   informed TOI that section 144 will remain in place for some time. “Curfew was lifted from Hindaun. But section 144, which was imposed earlier this week, will remain in force in some areas,” he said.

 The district collector added that the local administration and police are taking stock of the situation and section 144 will be lifted completely when the authorities are of view that there is no threat to the public order.
 
 The curfew was imposed in Hindaun on April 3 after houses of BJP MLA   and former   Bharosi Lal Jatav were torched allegedly by upper caste members to avenge the violence committed during SC/ST   a day earlier.
 
 Similarly, the Karauli police have been rounding up suspects in connection with the twin incidents of violence that were reported on April 2 and 3. The decision to expand curfew may have been prompted by the rumours circulation on social media about Bharat Bandh on April 10. The officials told TOI that all protests and rallies will be prohibited in the district.
 
 Meanwhile, the intelligence wing of Rajasthan police has been directed to keep an eye on people who could incite passions epically after the state witnessed widespread protest on April 2, at several districts, the bandh took a violent turn with protesters vandalizing cars and clashing with cops.
 
 The cops are on their toes after rumours circulated about Bharat Bandh on April 10. “No organization has sought permission for any kind of protest or dharna on April 10, neither any known group has made any indication to that effect,” a senior official told TOI, adding that central paramilitary forces in sufficient numbers have been camping in different parts of the state to avert any untoward situation.
