MUMBAI:   functionary Anil Parab on Monday riled   chief Ashish Shelar for alleging that the Sena-Congress had entered into a clandestine agreement in 42 Mumbai wards to defeat BJP candidates.

 “Shelar keeps talking of match-fixing as he is   president. He picked up this term from MCA, I believe. I dare him to cite the number of seats where Sena has entered into a pact with the  . The Sena doesn't play dirty politics,“ said Parab.
 
 Lambasting Shelar, Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said the Mumbai BJP president should furnish evidence in support of his allegation. “Shelar should keep all details on the table and discuss the issue with me on a public platform. I will defeat him in the argument and he will have to offer me unconditional apologies,“ said Nirupam.On Sunday , Shelar alleged that the Shiv Sena and the Congress had entered into a covert deal on 42 BMC seats. Shelar had claimed that in Vile Parle, the Congress denied a ticket to a Marathi businesswoman and gave it to a   candidate. He asserted that both the parties were being disloyal to Shivaji Maharaj, Mumbai and Maharashtra. BJP state chief Raosaheb Danve said that such `match fixing' happened in other states.
 
 Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, “We can prove that the charges are true. It's not surprising that both leaders are singing the same tune.“
