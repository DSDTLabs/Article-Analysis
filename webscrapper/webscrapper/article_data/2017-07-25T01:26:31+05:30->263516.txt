NEW DELHI: The number of people paying taxes in India shot up significantly to 6.26 crore in 2016-17, a top tax official said on Monday. The number of assessees was 5.70 crore in 2015-16.

 “As on date, we have got 6.26 crore assessees. It is a myth that we have 3-4 crore... assessees who have filed returns, paid advance tax or tax has been deducted at source. This is a large jump from earlier years,”   chairman   told a gathering of tax official at the   Day function.
 
 The government has taken several measures to widen the tax base and has launched a sustained campaign against black money in the past three years. Data has also shown that post-demonetisation, there has been a sharp jump in the number of people filing tax returns.
