CHANDIGARH: Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) leader Simarjit Singh   on Tuesday alleged that Punjab assembly speaker   K P Singh had specially created the post of law officer in the   to accommodate his nephew   Singh.

 Bains sought a CBI probe into the alleged recruitment ‘scam’ in various Vidhan Sabha appointments.
 
 However, the speaker rubbished all allegations. “I do not have any nephew. Every recruitment in the Vidhan Sabha has been made in a fair and transparent manner. I don’t want to comment on the mining issue.” Rana further added, “This recruitment falls under my jurisdiction. Anybody is free to challenge the selection process, if he feels so.”
 
 Bains told newspersons that he had sent a complaint to the Punjab chief minister, the Chief Justice of India, the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana high court and the CBI director. “Till date there was no post of law officer in the Punjab assembly,” said Bains. He added Bikram was a resident of   in Himachal Pradesh and the criteria were ‘tailor-made’ to suit his qualification.
 
 The LIP leader also alleged for the recently-held recruitment in the assembly, only 19 vacancies of safai karamcharis (sanitation workers), clerks and other posts were advertised but 36 persons were appointed without declaring any merit. All the selected employees were pre-decided, alleged Bains.
 
 The LIP leader also alleged that   secretary Shashi Lakhanpal Mishra’s family member Raghav Mishra had been appointed by specially vacating a post by illegally promoting the earlier post holder.
