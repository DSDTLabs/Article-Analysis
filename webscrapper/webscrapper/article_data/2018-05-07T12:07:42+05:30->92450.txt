VELLORE: In a sting operation, the idol wing CID sleuths, headed by inspector general of police A G Pon Manickavel, arrested two miscreants trying to sell three   of Hindu deities (Murugan, Valli and Deivanai) at Pernambut village near Vellore on Sunday evening.

 The eight members of the special team posed as buyers and trapped the accused when they came with the idols in a car. According to the police, the accused have been identified as Eshwaran, 50, and Arumugam, 38, both hailing from Aravatla village here.
 
 Based on a tip that a few smugglers were looking for customers to sell idols of Hindu deities, the special team of police contacted the gang over phone and fixed a meeting for the transaction. 
 
 The gang reportedly charged 5 crore for the three idols and decided to meet the ‘customers’ on Sunday evening to close the deal.
 
 Around 3pm, a five-member gang reached Pernambut, but it smelled a rat and tried to escape from the spot by abandoning the idols in the car. But the police swung into action swiftly and managed to   two of them. They broke the window glass of the car and seized the idols kept in it. 
 
 Police believe the three idols belong to Pallikuppam Murugan temple. They were stolen in October 2017. Police have launched a hunt for the other miscreants who managed to escape.
