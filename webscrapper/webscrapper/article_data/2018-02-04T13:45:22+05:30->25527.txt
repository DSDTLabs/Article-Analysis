MYSURU:   consultant oncologist Dr Vedapriya said the hospital has procured iBreast Exam, a hand held point-of-care medical kit that has capability to detect   in its early stages.

 The hospital authorities said that they plan to screen women in colleges, clubs and societies in the district free of cost using the kit.
 
 Vedapriya told reporters here on Saturday that normally breast cancer is detected in later stages when the patient’s condition has significantly deteriorated.
 
 “iBreast Exam makes early   a reality which has become important in the wake of alarming breast cancer incidents throughout the country. India is witnessing an increasing incidence of breast cancer with around 1.5 lakh new cases every year. In urban India, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women with 1 to 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime,” she said.
 
 Vedapriya said that delay in early diagnosis is one of the two major reasons that lead to high mortality rate (50%) in this type of cancer. That other reason is lack of preventive breast health checks. Regular screenings would help in the fight against cancer.
 
 “With iBreast Exam, the hospital would be the first in Mysuru to offer this affordable and accessible option for women to opt for screening even on the slightest suspicion they might have pertaining to their breasts, as the kit can detect breast tumours as small as 3 to 5 mm. The kit does so without emitting any harmful radiation and the examination is done in 15 to 20 minutes,” she said.
 
 Meanwhile, Dr Palaniappa said the hospital has procured the equipment under   initiative. “We are planning to take up mass screening in villages in the district. We will train medical staff on how to use the kit. The details of the positive cases will be uploaded on a mobile app which will examined by specialized doctors. Such cases will be clinically examined in the hospital for treatment,” he said.
