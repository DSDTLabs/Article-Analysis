KOLKATA: Bengal turned on the style in the second half as they recovered from a goal down to thrash Maharashtra 5-1 in their   Group A match at the Howrah Stadium on Wednesday.

 
 Meanwhile in the day’s other game, Manipur took the lead riding Nganbam Naocha’s goal in the 25th minute but Vivek Rana cancelled it out in the 65th minute to hand Chandigarh a point.
 
 Bengal will next take on Chandigarh on March 25 while Manipur will lock horns with Kerala on March 23.
 
 Trailing by Leander Dharmai’s goal at halftime, the defending champions levelled the issue in 55th minute through Monotosh Chakladar.   put the team ahead seven minutes later. Bidyashagar Singh then struck twice in a span of three minutes and substitute Rajon Barman completed the rout a minute before the end of regulation time. Bengal moved up to six points with their second win. Earlier, the hosts made a confident start, but it was Maharashtra who took the lead in the eighth minute through a debatable goal. Kiran Pandhare chipped a free-kick, taking Bengal players by surprise. 
 
 Leander, who looked to be in off-side position, took a touch that beat Ranajit Majumder and rolled over the goalline. Bengal players protested vehemently but referee C Suman Kumar stood firm and awarded the goal to the visitors.
 
 The 32-time champions maintained their domination with Tirthankar Sarkar at the heart of most of Bengal attacks. However, lack of enterprise in the attacking third and poor finishing meant Ranjan Chowdhury's men went into the break 0-1 down. Sumit Das missed two sitters including a simple tap-in into an open net.
