Party on your mind? How about a theme party? While theme parties are not new, it’s the family   that are the latest in the field of merry making. Here, the entire family, kids included, kits out in a nod to the theme to add more punch to the partying. 

 
 
 For designer  , the fairy tale theme always works. The reason? There’s one character for everyone in the family. Take your pick from Cinderella or Prince Charming to Sleeping Beauty, and many more. “With just a few accessories, the fairy tale theme can be adapted into the wardrobe,” she says. Men team their simple suits with a crown or a sword; while women can accessorise with a tiara. 
  
 
 
 Another fancy theme for parties can be inspired from a specific region like Kashmir, Punjab, etc. “Men can wear a Kashmiri embroidery kurta and the woman can opt for different silhouettes,” suggests designer Hemant from the duo Hemant and Nandita. Kids can wear Kashmiri capes. 
 
 
  
 The season is right for colour. Designer   suggests picking colours like sea greens and aubergine. Men can go for jewel-toned pants or shirt and snazz it up with cufflinks. For women, Bahl suggests a full-length jacket dress or a tu-tu skirt. Kids can rock a dress with net sashes, funky socks and bow ties in theme colours.
