NAVI MUMBAI: It will be a toll free drive for   residents to the upcoming Navi Mumbai international airport.   will not charge any toll for the 1.76 km long bridge on stilt to be developed on mangroves on the 5.8km coastal road. It will provide direct connectivity for motoristst driving into the city by the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link ( ) for accessing the new airport. A unique feature of the coastal road is that it will bifurcate at the upcoming   railway station on the Uran corridor for direct entry into the airport.

 After three years of applying for green nod, Cidco has got the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) go ahead for the elevated corridor project worth Rs 609 crore, said chief engineer and in charge of the project, K Varkhedkar. 
 
 “Cidco will spend the money and not charge any toll, ’’ He told TOI.
 
 The coastal road connect to the airport from upcoming Targhar railway station will be a first of its kind in the state as the connectivity through elevated viaduct for motorists will also have Metro run in the middle.
 
  
  
 Targhar is a unique railway station as it has a Metro station (on CST elevated corridor and an exclusive sky station to airport)
 
  “It was discussed at the MCZMA meeting and Cidco came up with a proposal of building the bridge, so this led to cost escalation,’’ said Varkhedkar.
 
 The coastal road will also enable city residents to access SoBo directly and particulary those staying in the   node. The coastal road (5.8km) will start from Shivaji Nagar in Ulwe node where MTHL will touch base in the city. It will run till Aamre Marg that will help motorists to further access the   at the Kille junction and the city, while the bifurcation at upcoming Targhar will ensure entry/exit into the airport.
