On Saturday, the already vibrant city of Mumbai looked all the more bright and ‘pinkish’ when stunners  ,   and   walked the ramp in different shades of pink. All three wore stunning costumes to showcase the collections of various designers that had themes like summer of love, daliya flower and denims teamed with Indian wear respectively.

 Talking about her experience of being a showstopper, Sania said, “I enjoy doing this stuff (referring to ramp walk) and it comes very naturally to me. Thank you for the beautiful outfit, I feel really pretty and pink.” Dressed in an off-shoulder, ruffle gown, Disha looked like a million bucks. Talking about the collaboration, Disha said, “It was a privilege for me. The designs are so beautiful. I am so happy that I was chosen to be the showstopper.” When asked what kind of a dresser is she, Disha, flashing her innocent smile, replied, “I like to wear simple clothes… Tracks are my favourites.”
 
 Despite being her first big fashion event, ‘Munna Michael’ actress Nidhhi Agerwal was far from being nervous. “It is my first time and I did not trip or fall. The designer and I are both Bangalore girls and so it makes perfect sense.”
