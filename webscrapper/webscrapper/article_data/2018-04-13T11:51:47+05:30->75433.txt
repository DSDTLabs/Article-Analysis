HYDERABAD: Taking   as an example, the   government will come up with a   that will ensure more money into the coffers of the government. Punjab's local bodies, culture and tourism minister Navjot Singh Sindhu. who was in Hyderabad on Friday, said from doing a study of the mining policy in many states, he found that what was adopted in Telangana was the best. 

 Sidhu was appointed chairman of a sub-committee on mining in Punjab and it was this assignment that brought him to Telangana. 
 
 "As such, the problem is not about the sand mafia. It is the transport mafia that make sand smuggling possible," Sidhu said adding that the Telangana government had taken measures to tackle this problem mainly through use of technology. "Tabs are kept on vehicles carrying sand and their movements are monitored. This is the best thing that we can implement in Punjab," he said. 
 
 Sidhu also said price fixation was another thing that could be emulated as the online selling had made it transparent. He also said the concept of having godowns from where the sand could be transported was a perfect plan being implemented in Telangana. "I am not trying to indulge in flattery. The best practices in Telangana when adopted in Punjab will plug revenue losses and fill the government coffers," he said. He said he would suggest a mining corporation to be formed in Punjab, like the Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation. 
 
 "From just Rs 10 cr in 2014, Telangana increased its revenue to Rs 1,300 cr last year. This year it may be Rs 1,500 cr. It has got Rs 43 cr in just 11 days. This is impressive," he said. 
 
 "If Telangana, with just one and a half river can get such  , Punjab which has more should be able to get more," he said.
