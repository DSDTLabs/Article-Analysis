 The humidity level fluctuated between 10% and 20% due to which people experienced dry and chilly winds in the morning and towards the evening. Some had to take out their warm clothes out of the closets again to battle the chilly winds. There was also surge in crowds at tea and daal-vada shops. They were seen enjoying the cold weather with their friends and families.Roadside and slum dwellers had a tough time in the evening and had to light bonfires to beat the chill.
