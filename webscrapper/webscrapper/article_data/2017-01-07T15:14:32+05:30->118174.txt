NEW DELHI: A non-bailable warrant was again issued today by a Delhi court against the alleged middleman 
  in the AgustaWestand case.

 The   court also reissued a summons against a company created by Michel and two of its directors who are accused in the case, which is also called the VVIP chopper scam. 
 
 
  
 
 The summonses were issued as the accused -   and its directors, R K Nanda and J B Subramaniyam - failed to appear before court today as they were supposed to per an order of last month. The summonses were issued against them under Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The next date of hearing is now scheduled for February 22.
