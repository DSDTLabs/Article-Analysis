After receiving a threatening note from Vaidehi, Roshni gets scared and asks Piyush to save her. However, when she shows Piyush the letter sent by Vaidehi, there is nothing on it. Apparently, Vaidehi wrote it with an ink which disappears in some time. 

 This causes Piyush to scold Vaidehi and creates more differences between them. A man asks Piyush to come and meet Laila after her performance and Piyush gives him money for the information. 
 
 Meanwhile, Roshni tries explaining Piyush of her innocence, saying that she was unconscious while he married her. And hence, not to be blamed for his unhappiness. Piyush turns silent and leaves.
