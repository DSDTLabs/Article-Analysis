MUMBAI: The first batch of 41   pirates was   on Friday from among the 117 caught in Indian waters in 2011 and freed recently. A special   was arranged by the Somali  , a relief for the police, who did not know what to do with the penniless   after their release.

 
 The remaining pirates continue to linger in different jails, including the one in Taloja, as they have nowhere to go. Many of the 41 sent home had been spending their days loitering near the   since the completion of their seven-year term. Some of them had even started staying inside the police station.
 
 “Today the first batch of 41 Somalis was deported and now the embassy plans to send the second batch soon,” DCP (port zone) Rashmi Karandikar. 
 
 On March 12, 2011, officers on the navy ship Kalpeni, which was on anti-piracy patrol duty off the coast of Lakshadweep, were appraised that a pirate attack had taken place on the merchant vessel Sagittarius Leader. The prosecution stated that after fighting off an attack from the pirate vessel, which involved firing from machine guns, the pirates agreed to surrender. 
 
 They were convicted by a sessions court on August 2, 2017, under various charges. The court had directed that they be deported once they completed the remainder of their prison term. 
 
 The police said the Somali embassy had to be informed about the situation as the pirates were not legal immigrants.
