 will soon have a ‘towel’ moment in ' '. Apparently, the actor, whose fitness levels are impressive and sports a six-pack, was required to enact a scene where he’d flaunt his abs. However, when the actor was asked to portray the scene wearing a towel, it caught him by surprise. 

 He says, “I was only given a two-day notice. So, I had to stop eating and drinking water. I survived on fruits. I have six-pack abs but they’re more visible when you drink less water. I had to undergo this crazy routine for almost 18 hours. My lips and throat went dry. I couldn’t even sleep because I was starving. I had to wait for the director to call it a day after which I treated myself to a large pizza.”
 
 On the personal front, the actor, who was involved with his ' ' co-actor Priyal Gor a few years ago, is happily single now. 
 He says, “I am not thinking of marriage or a relationship at the moment. Priyal and I were immature at that time and I am happy that we called our relationship off. Now that so many years have gone by, I realise how those fights were trivial and how we could have done things differently. We are cordial now, and wish each other well.”
