PUNE: Private school operators in Pune have taken legal action against the state education department for failing to reimburse fees for admitting children under the Right to Education ( ) Act.

 A petition had been filed by the Independent English School Association ( ) in Bombay high court against the state government earlier this month. The court in its interim order stated that no action should be taken against private schools for not admitting students under RTE till February 28.
  
  
 The RTE admission process is currently underway and parents willing to take admission under the scheme have been given time for filling the forms. In such a situation, a tussle between private schools and state government would hamper the admission process and hundreds of children would suffer.
 
 Addressing a news conference on Thursday, Rajendra Singh, secretary, IESA, said that, "Since dues of last three to four years are still pending with the government, we have decided to boycott participation in the admission process."
 
 Singh has said that as many as 824 schools are affiliated to IESA and have taken similar stand regarding RTE admissions. Singh also claimed that a total amount of Rs 930 crore is due from the government to private schools.
 
 "Considering the inaction by government and unwillingness to pay dues, we decided to go to the court. However, the state education department has not taken any action or responded to the court order, and hence, a fine of Rs 1,000 has been slapped on the state government," said Singh.
 
 The high court has asked to the state government to present its response in the matter on February 23. The last date of filling application forms by parents is February 28.
