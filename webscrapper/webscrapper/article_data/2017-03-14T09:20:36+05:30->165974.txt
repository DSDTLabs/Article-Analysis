HYDERABAD: Finance minister   brought little cheer to varsities and educationalists as they felt that government's promises cannot be fulfilled with a funds allocation of Rs 12,705 crore. Be it recruiting teachers or establishing gurukuls and schools for minority children or building infrastructure, experts said the budget is 'unrealistic'. 

 "I feel money allotted for education is insufficient.   alone would need more than 300 crore and other universities need at least half that amount," said M Kodandaram, chairman,  . "The government also made promises to establish gurukul schools, special schools for BC, SC/ST and Muslims. Where would the money come from for infrastructure and recruitments," he asked. 
 
 Osmania university vice-chancellor Prof S Ramachandram said they had sought Rs 400 crore and it would be difficult to maintain with the block grant of Rs 269.16 crore. "The university has heavy pension burden and with money allocated it would be difficult to pay salaries to all staff. We got Rs 238 crores in the last budget," said Ramachandram. 
 
 On the other hand, Prof T Papi Reddy, chairman,   said if the money is insufficient, more funds can be released later. "These are our educational institutions and this is our government. Nobody is going anywhere. If the money is less, institutions can ask for more," said Reddy.
