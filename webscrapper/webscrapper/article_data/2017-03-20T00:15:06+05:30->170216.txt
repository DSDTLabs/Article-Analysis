   seems to have a connect with the New York Indian Film Festival. Last year, he was there with his directorial U-Turn, which premiered at the festival. This time around, an indie film that he is presenting,  , will be premiering at the festival. "This film is made by a young team from Mangaluru. Raj Shetty, the director and writer, has also performed in this film. They were in touch with me during the U-Turn promotions time and showed me the rough cut. I liked their film and decided to take over in the final stages,” says Pawan. The story, says Pawan, is akin to Iranian films which deal with everyday life with actors who are more real. “As the title suggests, it is about a bald man. In our country, there is a lot of stereotyping done basis how people look, be it their hair, their body shape, their height or skin colour. This film deals with these issues, but in a very Chaplinesque manner, in a funny and situation-based narrative,” adds Pawan, who now plans to promote the film in the festival circuits.
