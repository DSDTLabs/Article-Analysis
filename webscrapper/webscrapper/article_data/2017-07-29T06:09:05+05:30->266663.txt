VARANASI: Senior   leader   on Friday said he would launch   in a month's time if party leaders failed to regroup. The formation of the Morcha is aimed at restoring the honour of party patriarch and elder brother Mulayam Singh Yadav, he added. 

 Sidelined by the SP leadership, led by nephew Akhilesh Yadav, since the bitter family feud came out in the open in September 2016, Shivpal said he would tour the state and talk to leaders who were "marginalised" in the party. 
 
 "I will travel across the state and talk to partymen in the next one month before forming the Morcha," he said. 
 
 Shivpal claimed that he was getting "tremendous" support from the people. "We will unite those who have been neglected in the SP to form the Secular Morcha and fight for the poor, farmers and traders," he said.
 
 "Humne ek mauka diya hai ki pura pariwar ikattha ho, aur Netaji ko phir se samman mile. Agar nahi to Samajwadi Secular Morcha Netaji ke netritva mein jaldi banayenge, aur samajik nyaya ki ladayi ladenge (We have given them (SP leadership) a chance to end the differences in the family and honour Netaji. If that doesn't happen, we will form the front led by Netaji soon)," Shivpal told reporters in Azamgarh, Mulayam's   constituency. 
 
 "I am with Mulayam and want others to reunite and give 'samman' (honour) to Netaji (Mulayam). It is because of the differences within the party that the SP was voted out of power in 2017," he said.
 
 When asked whether Mulayam will accept the governor's post, Shivpal said, "There is no such offer. Even if it comes, Netaji will never accept."
 
 Shivpal said he would not speak against the Aditya Nath Yogi government's performance in the next six months. "The government has just come out with its first budget. It needs time," he said. He, however, said the law and order situation needed to be improved.
