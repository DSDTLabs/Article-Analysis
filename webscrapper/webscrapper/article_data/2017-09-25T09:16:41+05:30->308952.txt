PUNE: The   has reduced the release of water into the   and is likely to stop it in the next few days, much before the October second week deadline.

 The recent downpour had raised the levels of most water bodies in the rural parts of the district to their respective maximum capacities, prompting the department to take the decision.
 
 The   canal (Mutha canal) carries water to the rural parts of the district. Most of these areas had received fewer spells of rainfall during the ongoing monsoon, following which the irrigation department released water. Officials said they were considering to stop the water release in phases within the next few days.
 
 “The eastern parts of the district received good spells of rain. This increased the storage in most ponds in Indapur, Haveli and Daund.The release rate has been reduced to 1,000 cusecs and will be soon stopped,“ an official said. Once the irrigation department stops releasing water, it can save more water in the dams for the city . The department had planned to release water in to the canal till around October 15. Till 10 days previously , water was being released at the race of 1,400 cusecs.
 
 The officials said further release of water into the canal will be planned after October. The canal gets water in two rotations during winter.The first rotation starts in the last week of October, depending on the withdrawal of monsoon.
 
 The late spells of rain could delay release of water and less water would be required for the crops. “The Met department is yet to declare the dates of monsoon withdrawal. If the department records heavy spells of rain this year, the department will be able to save more water in the dams,“ an official said.
 
 The dams also release water for the rural area in two rotations in summer, besides the two winter rotations.
