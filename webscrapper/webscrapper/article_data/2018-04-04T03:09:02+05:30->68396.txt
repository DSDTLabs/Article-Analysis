NEW DELHI: The   (ED) on Tuesday questioned Delhi health and power minister   in connection with a   registered against him and others. 

 Officials said that Jain was summoned under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and his statement was recorded by the investigating officer of the case. He was grilled for over three hours, they said.
 
 The PMLA case was registered by the ED last year in August on the basis of a   FIR. The CBI complaint had said that Jain could not explain the source of funds received by four companies in which he was a shareholder. It had registered a case against him, his wife and four others on charges of money laundering. The CBI has questioned him in the case earlier.
 
 CBI sources had said that Rs 4.63 crore was allegedly received through Prayas Info Solutions, Akinchan Developers, Managalyatan Projects and   in 2015-16. They had said Jain and his wife were allegedly holders of one-third of the shares in these companies during the period.
 
 The CBI alleged that Jain had control over these companies either in the form of being one of the directors and by holding one-third of shares of these companies in his name or in the names of his family members or others. 
 
 "This apart, before becoming a public servant, he was allegedly involved in laundering Rs 11.78 crore during 2010-12 through these companies as well as other firms also based in New Delhi," the CBI had said.
 
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), however, had refuted the CBI's allegations and said that reports of Jain's involvement in shell companies and benami land deals were "baseless".
 
 The ED probe will focus on finding if he and other accused in the case created illegal assets by laundering the alleged tainted funds.
