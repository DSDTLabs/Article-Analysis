CHENNAI: Ongoing demolition of an apartment complex on Kalakshetra Road in   has made life difficult for residents of the locality, with the work mostly taking place late at night.

 Kolam Flats, on the eastern side of the road that connects   with  , is being brought down to pave the way for a new apartment complex, residents said. The contractor involved in the operation uses earthmovers and other heavy vehicles that create an almost continuous racket, the residents said.
 
 “The past few nights have been harrowing. The constant movement of tipper trucks and monotonous rambling of the earthmovers have resulted in sleepless nights,” said  , who lives on the stretch. “We complained to police on Sunday night. They asked us to cooperate. When we refused, they asked the contractor to stop demolition at night. But workers resumed the job on Monday night.”
 
 While the demolition activities briefly stopped at 12.30am on Monday, they resumed around 3am. “This is ridiculous. How can they resume work when police has asked them not to? Something is amiss,” another resident said.
 
 When contacted, the contractor engaged by the apartment developer said the demolition activities undertaken by them were within the rules and that they had all the approvals in place.
 
 Traffic along the road has been increasing with thousands of motorists using it to avoid the cramped Thiruvanmiyur junction and the demolition has compounded the situation, said  , another resident.
 
 “As it is, we have little peace during the day because of heavy traffic. The demolition is making the noise an unending ordeal. It’s sad that a once peaceful locality has been reduced to this,” she added.
