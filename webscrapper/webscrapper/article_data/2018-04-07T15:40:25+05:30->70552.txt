Playback singer   has taken many trips to Jaipur for work but it was for the first time that she came to the city for a holiday. The singer told us that her four-day-long trip with her friends turned out to be one of the best holidays, so far. So much so that she didn’t feel like returning to Mumbai. “I have been to Jaipur multiple times. However, it is always for work. This was for the first time that I came to the city for a holiday. I came to Jaipur with some of my friends-turned-family,” said Kanika.

  
  
 
 The singer told us that Jaipur was her first choice for this holiday. “I have never lived in Jaipur but the city feels like home to me. Be it the people, hospitality, culture or architecture, everything is so fascinating that you don’t feel like returning. I wish I could stay here a little longer,” she said.
 
 During this trip,   visited historical monuments and even indulged in retail therapy at the local markets of Jaipur. “I bought a lot of block-printed kurtas, silver jewellery, jootis and all things girly. Everything was so eye-catching that I just couldn’t stop myself from buying. My friends had to literally stop me. They told me that you would go broke if you don’t stop,” Kanika laughingly said. Kanika told us, “I can go on and on about Jaipur.This city is just fabulous.The food is amazing. We tried a Rajasthani thali and laal maans at one of the heritage hotels. It was delectable.”
 
 When asked if the soaring temperature made sight-seeing and shopping a little difficult for her? “It is not hot at all; it is beautiful. We had so much fun,” she said. Kanika is now gearing up for the release of her upcoming single, which is inspired by Rajasthani folk music. “I had shot for the song at the City Palace in Jaipur and a few other locations around the city along with  ,” she said.
