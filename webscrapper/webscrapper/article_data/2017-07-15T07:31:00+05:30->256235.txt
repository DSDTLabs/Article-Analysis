Patiala: Various local Hindu organizations held a protest march against the recent killings of Amarnath pilgrims in Jammu and Kashmir, here on Friday. Members of Shiv Sena Hindustan, Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Suraksha, Hindu Kranti Dal, Hindu Welfare Board, Samaaj Sewa Society and Khatri Sabha marched across the town, forcibly shutting down shops.

 Though the protest remained peaceful across the district, the members of the right wing outfits raised communal slogans in presence of some senior police officers. The protesters also raised anti-Pakistan slogans and later burnt effigy of the Pakistan government.
 
 However, the bandh call received a lukewarm response in other parts of the district, including Nabha, Samana, Patran and Rajpura. At some places, shopkeepers shut down their shops in fear, while others were forced to close their establishments. One of the protesters was also rounded up for pelting stones at an open shop.
 
 Patiala superintendent of police Kesar Singh said heavy security arrangements were made in the entire district and the police walked beside the protesters to keep the situation under control.
