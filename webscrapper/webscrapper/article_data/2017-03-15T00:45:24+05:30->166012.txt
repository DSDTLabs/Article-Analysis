Gurgaon: Four months after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced that a   would be set up in the city, the MCG has earmarked   of land in   for the institute. 

 A report has already been sent to the district administration last week to take the process further, officials said.
 
 “We have identified the land and informed the deputy commissioner who has to clear the report so that the land can be handed over to the concerned department such as PWD for developing the campus,” said Sudhir Chouhan, senior town planner, MCG. He added the corporation can participate in the funding of the project if required.
 
 Khattar had announced in November that a medical college would be set up in the city following demands in this regard from the residents. 
 
 Due to the lack of proper medical facilities at the Civil Hospital in Gurgaon, residents from the economically weaker section are often compelled to travel to Delhi to avail treatment at government hospitals such as AIIMS or Safdarjung hospital.
 
 According to rough estimates, around 1,500 to 2,000 patients visit Civil Hospital's outpatient department (OPD) daily. However, in the absence of facilities like electroencephalography (EEG) machine, burns unit, cochlear implant laboratory, dialysis centre, many patients are often referred to the city's private hospitals or government hospitals in Delhi.
 
 TOI had earlier reported in January that following an inspection at Civil Hospital, additional chief secretary, health department, Rajan Kumar Gupta asked the authorities to earmark land for the medical college and revamp the existing civil hospital.
