LUDHIANA: Police booked a dairy farmer and his friend after they allegedly fired at the farmers who threw the former’s milk as part of nationwide protest at   village in   on Saturday night. The accused were identified as dairy farmer   of Lapran and Surinder Singh from Daburji.

 Police officials said a group of protesting farmers saw   Singh coming on his bike with milk containers. Cops said after stopping him, the protesters checked the containers and threw milk on the road, which angered the dairy farmer. In the meanwhile, Surinder Singh, who was watching the incident, reached the spot and objected to the action of protesters. As the protesters had heated arguments with Surinder, he, along with Gurdeep, went to his house and returned with a gun.
 
 Cops said when the accused fired twice in the air, the protesters ran away and a while later Gurdeep and Surinder also left. But later the protesters informed the police, who reached the spot, started probe and booked the accused under Section 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC on the complaint of Varinder Singh, a resident of Daburji village.
 
 Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector   said, “A manhunt has been launched to arrest the accused. Preliminary investigation suggests that the accused had fired in the air from a distance to scare the protesters. The accused used a licensed weapon.”
 
 The dairy farmer owns a shop near Daburji. Police officials said protesters were not booked for throwing milk as there was no counter-complaint.
