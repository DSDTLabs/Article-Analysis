MUMBAI:   has demanded several changes in the   announced by its senior ally in the government,   (BJP), in the   on Tuesday. 

 Speaking on a congratulatory motion moved by BJP member Anil Bonde for the government's unprecedented loan waiver scheme, Sena member from Nanded, Subhash Sabane, said that the government should extend the cut-off to waive loans from June 30,2016 to 2017. He also demanded that the amount of Rs 25,000 which the government will give back to every farmer repaying loans regularly be increased to Rs 1 lakh.
 
 "There are some more changes that if implemented than the scheme will benefit many others," said Sabane.
 
 The Sena's pro-farmer posturing was dented by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which asked it to dole out a part of the Rs60,000-crore deposits that have lying with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for the loan waiver scheme. 
 
 Former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, "The state government is struggling to raise funds for the scheme. The Sena should ask the civic body to part with part of the funds lying with banks. The state government can pay the same interest as nationalised banks do."
 
 The Opposition was critical of the way the waiver was being implemented. "Why should farmers have to make an online application for the waiver? In the villages, there is either poor internet connectivity or none at all. Besides, who is going to fill the applications?" said leader of the Opposition in the assembly, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil. "If the government has announced a waiver of Rs 34,000 crore, why has it made supplementary budgetary demands for only Rs 20,000 crore in the assembly." 
 
 Bonde blamed the Opposition for "slow" progress in doling out the Rs 10,000 crop advance to farmers.
