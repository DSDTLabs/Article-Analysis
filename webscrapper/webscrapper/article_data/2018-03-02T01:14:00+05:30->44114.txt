Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday ordered the state’s prison authority to release R P Ravi alias Ravichandran, life convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case on parole for 15 days, with certain conditions including not to meet press and any organisation.

 A division bench of justices S Vimala and T Krishnavalli which heard Ravichandran’s case also directed the authorities to permit him to visit the Sri Meenakshi Amman temple. 
 
 Ravichandran filed the parole application saying that he had to settle his property dispute. When he was released on parole already, police did not permit him to settle it, he said. 
 
 It may be noted that deputy inspector general of prisons (Madurai) opposed his parole saying that the probation officer, Virudhunagar, had stated that since he was involved in the assassination, there are possibilities of life threat to the petitioner and law and order problem.
 
 The Aruppukottai police inspector also strongly objected granting leave to him, since his residential area is not fit for his security. Besides, the petitioner’s family properties are situated 50km away in Tuticorin. If he wishes to go there, it will be difficult for the police to deploy police personnel for his escort. It is also noted that his mother had already approached the authorities to release him on parole, but they rejected her request by passing an order. Thereafter, she filed a case before the court which on August 2, last year dismissed her plea by giving liberty to her to challenge the authority’s order. Following it, the convict filed the case.
