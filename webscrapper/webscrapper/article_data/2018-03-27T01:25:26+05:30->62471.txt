GURUGRAM: The   officials have been asked to finish all delayed micro-level projects, including road repair, water and sewerage works, within five months and allot tenders for   only after clearing land of encroachments.

 The directions came from PWD minister   during a meet with the MCG officials in Gurugram on Monday. Taking a stock of development projects, Singh directed the commissioner to ensure all city parks were well maintained and had water provisions. “The projects which have been delayed for a while must be completed in the next four to five months and in case of any further delays, the officials concerned must be held accountable,” he said.
