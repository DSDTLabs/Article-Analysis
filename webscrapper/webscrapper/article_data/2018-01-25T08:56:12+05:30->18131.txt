CHARMINAR: For the first time, dry fruit traders from Afghanistan have travelled all the way to Hyderabad to set up a stall at the ongoing All India Industrial Exhibition, Numaish, in Nampally. A runaway hit with visitors, the stall is stocked with almonds, pistachios, walnuts, dates, cashew nuts, peanuts, dried apricots, figs, raisins, mulberries and blueberries.

 Afghanistan’s dry fruits are acclaimed for its superior quality and are in high demand globally. “Though there are a variety of dry fruits available here, the produce from Afghanistan is very different and organic. You will not get this kind of quality anywhere else,” said  , owner of the stall. Reiterating the magnitude of the trade, he added, “Afghanistan is one of the leading producers of dry fruits in the world. The produce in our country is among the world’s tastiest.”
 
 Ali’s claim about the taste of his country’s produce standing apart was seconded by  , a visitor at the stall. “The dates I tasted here have a completely different flavour. They have a distinct sweetness, something that we do not get here,” the visibly overwhelmed customer said.
 
 Apart from the response, the affection extended by the people of the city, has left Ali moved. “People in Hyderabad are so warm and compassionate towards us. We would definitely like to come every year,” he said.
 
 The traders at the stall are hopeful that following their pleasant experience at Numaish, the influx of other traders from Afghanistan into the city will increase in future.
