E-commerce major   is on a drive to add new female customers during the festive season sale Currently , the e-tailer -much like its peers -sees 65 per cent of sales coming from male consumers, while the rest is from women who typically have higher stickiness.

 To get more women shoppers onto Flipkart, the home grown e-tailer is using targeting techniques to bring cross category offers to them. Flipkart has signed on brands in fashion, home and books -where women tend to make more transactions than men It has also been ramping up its collection in line with its internal data, which shows women spend 2.2 times more time than men, leading to higher conversion rate for transactions. Flipkart claims to have over 100 million registered users and is aiming to push the women buyers' base to about 45 per cent, going forward. The company's effort to get more female consumers would be a challenging task because India has had more male internet users than female, but multiple studies predict this ratio is likely to change.
 
 Flipkart senior director   said, “We are pushing certain categories and bringing top brands exclusively onto the platform to get a new set of women users during the sale season.“
 
 The Flipkart-owned fashion-focused e-tailer Myntra too sees higher sales from male buyers compared to females.  , analyst at market research company  , said, “The presence of more male online consumers is related to the overall internet access and jobs in the country.“
