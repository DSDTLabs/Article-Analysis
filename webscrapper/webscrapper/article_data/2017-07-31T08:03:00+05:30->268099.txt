NOIDA: Over 40   photography enthusiasts converged at Dhanauri wetlands on Sunday morning to catch a glimpse of feathered friends. Birdwatchers spotted and captured Sarus cranes and other monsoon visitors in their lens. Dhanauri, recognized as a wetland in 2014, is home to over 120 Sarus cranes. “Due to the rains, the wetland is now full of water. While the Sarus crane was a big attraction at the walk, we also found Purple heron, Egyptian vulture, Hoopoe, Jacobin Cuckoo, Bronze-winged Jacana, Grey-headed swamphen, Baya Weaver, Red-wattled lapwing, Indian robin, River Tern, Indian spot-billed duck, Indian cormorant, Egret and the common Moorhen among other birds,” Mathew  , founder,  , said. 

 “We chose to go to Shanauri this weekend as the water there is usually full and the wetland looks best at this time. Being far away from the din of the city, we got plenty of time to go into the wilderness of the wetland and explore the bird habitat. It was a very special birding and bird photography event for us today. It is good to see, more and more serious birders joining our group from various parts of Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida,” Joseph added.
 
 At a distance of odd 46 kilometres away from Noida, Dhanauri was first noticed as a Sarus breeding zone, when birder   chanced upon it during a birding trip in 2014 and demanded it be notified as a wetland. Dhanauri is a marshland with a core wet area of 100 acres, surrounded by a buffer green zone. It spreads across YEIDA's Sector 16 and 17. Arya had informed the UP state government, NGT and the MoEF of his findings.
