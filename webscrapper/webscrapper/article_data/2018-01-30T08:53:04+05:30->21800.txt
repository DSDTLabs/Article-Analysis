SURAT: This 62-year-old woman distributes kits containing sanitary pads and other products to 5,000 women every month which helps them to maintain their personal hygiene. After five years of creating awareness about hygiene, she believes that there is much to do in this area.

 Meena Mehta,  , started distributing sanitary pads with financial aid of Rs 25,000 from her husband Atul around five years ago. “I started by giving a kit containing a sanitary pad packet,  , a couple of soaps and a shampoo sachet to five underprivileged girls. Gradually, we realized that there is a need to increase the number of beneficiaries. Now I distribute kits to over 5,000 girls of 35 municipal schools and women living in slums of the city,” said Mehta,  ,  
 
 She was inspired to distribute sanitary napkins on reading about philanthropist Sudha Murthy, who gifted sanitary napkins to women in tsunami-affected areas in 2004. She had also noticed some girls picking up used sanitary napkins from dustbins. “I asked them about it and the girls said they will wash the sanitary napkins and use them. I then decided to distribute sanitary napkins to poor women,” Mehta said.
 
 A number of individual donors began to contribute to Mehta’s foundation on learning how she was helping women. She receives donation from across the world. “I spend nearly Rs 3 lakh to distribute 5,000 kits. We get financial support from many people. Even if we don’t get any support, we would continue with this work,” Mehta said.
 
 She explains, “A new underwear that we give in the kit helps in the effective use of the sanitary napkin by a woman. Soap and shampoo also help the women to maintain their personal hygiene because a majority of beneficiaries of our scheme belong to poor background.”
