With just a week to go for the launch of television show   Anand, starring  , the makers are having sleepless nights. The family of the late Bollywood actor   raised a stink over the show’s title. After a lot of back and forth, the makers have now trimmed the title to just Dev. The overnight change in the name has also led to the launch of the show 
getting pushed by a week. 
 
 While the producers   and   remained unavailable for comment, a source from the production house revealed, “We received a notice from Dev Anand’s family, which was forwarded to the channel. They must have discussed the matter, following which the show got a new title. We didn’t realise that it would pose such a huge problem.”
 
 Ashish Chowdhry, who plays the title role in the show, adds, “It is news to me, too. From what I know, Mr Dev Anand’s family had an issue with his name in the title. To each their own. In my personal view, it’s a tribute to a legendary actor. The name resonates with one and all and that says it all. But I understand the family’s reservations, too. I had changed my handle on a micro-blogging site to my character’s name —  . Guess it’s time to change that as well.”
 
 Despite repeated attempts, we couldn’t get a response from the late actor's family.
