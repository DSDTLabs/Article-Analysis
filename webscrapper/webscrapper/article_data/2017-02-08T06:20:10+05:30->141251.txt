CHANDIGARH: Stubble in over two lakh hectares of land was burnt last year in   despite the state government cracking the   who defied orders restricting the practice. Crop-residue burning had led to   across the region and also severely affected air quality in the National Capital Region.
 
 According to the Hisarbased Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC), the area in which stubble was burnt in 2016 was more than what it was in the previous two years and the same as 2013.
 
 “Stubble was burnt (during the harvest period) in over 2,08,000 hectares in 2013 and the successive two years showed declining trend. However, in 2016, stubble was burnt over the same area as it was in 2013,“ HARSAC chief scientist R S Hooda said on Tuesday .
 
 HARSAC has been doing this study for the last four years. A few years back the   wanted the centre to find out how much area was involved and look into the magnitude of the problem ( ), he said.
 
 “Satellite data showed that in 2013, stubble was burnt in 2,08,000 hectares of land, in 2014 in 1,78,000 hectares and in 2015 in 1,63,000 hectares. However, in 2016, it suddenly increased to what it was in 2013.Last November, we saw smog engulfing the Delhi and the NCR,“ Hooda said.
 
 The chief scientist said North and northwestern districts of Ambala, Yamunanagar, Panchkula, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat, Jind, Hisar, Fatehabad and Sirsa are the major rice growing areas.
 
 “Last year, we got this data from the districts. Major fire points were identified and as many as 12,500 points were seen,“ he said, adding daily satellite data indicates active points during harvest season.
 
 Many farmers in Haryana and neighbouring Punjab have over the years continued with the practice that has led to health risk and adversely affected soil health.
