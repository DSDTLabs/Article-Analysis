RANCHI: Deputy commissioner Manoj Kumar hoisted the largest   in eastern India atop the Pahadi Mandir Hill on  .

 There have been several attempts to keep the flag flying since it was first unfurled by Union defence minister   last year but these often failed, resulting in embarrassments like the tricolour being torn or flying at half-mast. 
 
 The Mandir committee and the state government had to give up trying to keep the flag flying after the high court asked them to ensure no further disrespect to it. Since then, the government has decided to hoists the flag only on Independence and Republic days.
 
 Thursday’s ceremony was attended by SDO K Jha and   who gave over a crore for the flag. More than 300 people attended the flag-hoisting. 
 
 Kumar said, “It is a privilege for me to hoist the flag. Pahadi Mandir is an important tourist spot and we are trying to develop it into a national attraction.” 
 
 Mukesh Agarwal, spokesperson for the Mandir committee, said, “The event took place smoothly and we are doing everything to ensure that no other incidents take place.”
 
 The 66x99 feet flag was made by Mumbai-based company   a few weeks ago. It was taken down at 4pm on Thursday.
