CHENNAI: The   has ordered notices to the Union telecom ministry and   on a PIL seeking immediate steps to resume mobile phone services of  .

 “More than 25 lakh subscribers have been affected in Chennai by the sudden stoppage of service by the cellular company. This is highly unethical and should have been viewed seriously by the government and Trai. But so far they have failed to act,” said PIL-petitioner G Saravanakumar. 
 
 He wanted the court to direct the company to restore mobile portability service, enabling the existing customers of Aircel to migrate their numbers to other network providers. 
 
 The petitioner said he had been a pre-paid customer of Aircel for more than 10 years. On February 21, without any prior intimation, the mobile services provided by the company came to a standstill across Tamil Nadu.
 
 Later, he came to know through a statement issued by the head of Aircel, south India, that out of 9,000 mobile phone network towers owned by the firm, 6,500 towers could not be operated due to rental defaults on the part of the company affecting its services in the state. 
 
 People were put to great discomfort, as they faced difficulty in availing welfare and government schemes, including LPG connections, because mobile numbers linked with such services were not working, the petitioner said. 
 
 Claiming that more than 8 lakh customers had already applied for mobile portability, which could not be completed due to stoppage of phone service, he wanted a direction to Trai to restore mobile phone services immediately to customers of Aircel at the earliest. 
 
 Recording the submissions, the bench posted the plea to March 19 for further hearing.
