RAJGIR/PATNA: Three days before the formation of a massive   on January 21 to spread awareness about prohibition, the   on Tuesday decided against renewal of   manufacturing units in the state.
 
  According to sources, there are currently 27 licensed distillers and bottling plants in the state. An investment of around Rs 1,000 crore has been made on them.
  
  A state cabinet meeting chaired by CM   at Rajgir decided that the licences of 21 distilleries operating in the state would not be renewed from 2017-18 financial year. These units may be allowed to operate if they start manufacturing non-alcoholic beverages from the facility.
  
  The licence of only six ethanol-based manufacturing plants would be renewed. Produced from sugarcane molasses, ethanol is used mostly for being mixed in petrol. It is supplied to leading oil companies.
  
  The decision follows the opposition criticism of the Nitish government’s “double standards on prohibition” as it was allowing manufacture of liquor in the state for its transportation to rest of the country. The Nitish government had in September last year waived taxes on liquor manufacturing units and decided to extend such benefits to even new plants provided they sold the beverages outside the state.
  
  The state cabinet approved altogether 32 proposals. It decided to open high schools in those panchayats which have become open defecation free. It also sanctioned Rs 196 crore for execution of the skill development component of the CM’s ‘Saat Nischay’ initiative.
