SAD leaders argue that this is the right time to demand amendment in Article 25 B of the Constitution as the RSS also went on record saying it recognised the separate religious identity of Sikhs. On October 23 last year, R S Prant Sanghchalak Brij Bhushan Singh Bedi issued a statement saying, “Sikhism, like Buddhism and Jainism, is a socio-religiously recognised religion and Sikhs have a separate identity. RSS clearly recognises Sikhism as a religion and has always acknowledged the separate identity of Sikh religion.”

 “The Sangh’s viewpoint became clear in 2001 when a meeting was held between then vice-chairman of the   for Minorities, Tarlochan Singh and senior RSS national spokesman Madhav Govind Vaid. Vaid, in a written document given to Tarlochan Singh, authenticated this fact that Sikhism, like Buddhism and Jainism, is a recognized Indian religion,” the RSS Punjab leader said.
 
 “I am again making it amply clear before the Sikh community that Sikhs, with their separate identity, like other religions, are a recognised Indian religion and Sangh has full faith and reverence for Sri Guru   and Gurbani. Sangh has always been a contributor in the worldwide propagation of Gurbani. That is why Sangh celebrates with great fervor the gurpurabs of Gurus and other festivals of the Sikh religion in its shakhas and programs,” he had said.
