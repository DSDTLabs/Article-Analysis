 I-T officials said that it is a provisional attachment of DPIL properties under Section 132 9B of the I-T Act after they found that the turnover figures given by the company were not correct.
 
 “We have done provisional attachment of the properties owned by DPIL amounting to Rs 1,000 crore. The properties include the company’s plant, machinery and land,” said a senior I-T official. “During investigations, we found that DPIL had shown bogus depreciation of the machinery that it never purchased. The company management claimed depreciation of Rs 150 crore for the machinery that never existed,” the official told TOI.
 
 The income tax is also sharing the case details with   and enforcement directorate (ED). The ED too had recently attached properties owned by DPIL and its related companies worth Rs 1,122 crore. “We will also put claim in the property for our recovery,” the I-T official added. 
 
 The income tax department opened four bank lockers operated by DPIL managing director Amit Bhatnagar and seized jewellery worth Rs 16.5 lakh three days ago. DPIL and its top management has been booked by the CBI for cheating various banks to the tune of Rs 2,654 crores by falsification of records, creation of false documents and forgery of records. 
 
 The central probe agency had searched the corporate office of the company and residences of its directors in the city last week.
 
 According to the FIR filed by the CBI, DPIL availed loans despite its name appearing in RBI’s defaulters’ list and the   caution list, which CBI officials say couldn’t have been possible without involvement of bank officials. 
 
 CBI has also booked unknown bank officials in this case. Apart from Amit Bhatnagar, DPIL founder Suresh Bhatnagar and joint MD   have already been arrested by the CBI.
