NEW DELHI: In a setback to global burger chain McDonald’s, the Delhi high court on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed by McDonald’s India challenging the order of the   ( ), which had issued a show-cause to the company.

 After McDonald’s terminated its franchise agreement with its 50:50 joint-venture partner — Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL) — in north and east India in August, CPRL’s MD   moved a contempt plea in NCLT. Bakshi alleged that the burger giant’s decision to terminate the licence was in violation of an earlier order by NCLT that reinstated him as CPRL’s MD. In the same order, NCLT had stated that McDonald’s should not interfere in the functioning of CPRL.
 
 Subsequently, NCLT issued a show-cause notice to McDonald’s, which prompted the US fast-food major to move the Delhi HC. While both parties are currently awaiting a detailed judgment by the HC, the dismissal of McDonald’s petition means the US fast-food chain will have to respond to NCLT’s show-cause notice.
 
 A McDonald’s India spokesperson told TOI, “We are evaluating our options.” Both Bakshi and McDonald’s have been locked in a bitter legal battle since 2013, when McDonald’s removed him as MD of CPRL alleging financial mismanagement. The legal tugof-war had resulted in repeated openings and closures of McDonald’s outlets in north and east India, as Bakshi decided to defy the termination of licence notice and carry on with business, as usual.
