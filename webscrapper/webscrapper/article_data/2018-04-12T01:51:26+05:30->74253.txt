GURUGRAM: A 19-year-old youth has been picked up by Gurugram police from Rajasthan’s   district for his alleged involved in several thefts at mobile shops across the city. 

 Police said the youth was held at least thrice earlier as a minor for thefts but every time he managed to escape from correction homes in Rajasthan. 
 
 Acting on a tip-off, a team from the city crime branch went to   (Alwar), Rajasthan, last Saturday and rounded up Gajender, alias Gajju, after raids with the help of local police there on Sunday.
 
 A total of 18 stolen mobile phones were found on him at the time of the arrest. The police said he was being questioned for the recovery of another 50 stolen mobile phones and laptops.
 
 Talking about his past records, the police said Gajju was only 15 when he had stolen a teacher’s bicycle. 
 
 Eventually, he became a notorious thief, striking at shops and houses at will.
 
  “Gajju’s father is a laborer and belongs to a poor family. He dropped out of school and got into crime. He was nabbed by Rajasthan Police and sent to correction homes thrice, but always managed to escape and committed thefts again. He fled the shelter home for the third time in March 2015. After that, he ran away from Alwar and began to steal items in different areas to make a living,” said sub-inspector  , in-charge of crime unit, Sushant Lok. 
 
 Finally, Gajju then took up a house on rent in Bhiwadi. He used to come all the way to Gurugram and raid at mobile shops, and then go back to Bhiwadi, make it difficult for cops to trace him. “He broke into at least five mobile shops in Gurugram and made off with mobiles, laptops and cash in the last one-and-a-half years alone. Several cases of thefts have been registered against him in Bhiwadi too. We are questioning him and hope to recover more stolen goods,” said ACP (crime) Shamsher Singh.
 
 He was produced in a city court on Monday, which sent him to five-day police remand.
