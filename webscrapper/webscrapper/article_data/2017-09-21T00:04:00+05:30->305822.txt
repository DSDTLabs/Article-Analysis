Madurai: V V Rajan Chellappa, Madurai North MLA on Wednesday said that assembly speaker, P Dhanapal could have suspended the 18 MLAs, owing allegiance to T T V Dhinakaran, instead of disqualifying them.

 Speaking to mediapersons here, he said that what was important is to keep the party intact, and take steps to strengthen it. He said that there was nothing called ‘sleeper cell MLAs,’ as far as the AIADMK was concerned. Even when the MLAs supported O Panneerselvam when there was a crisis, no action was taken against them, he pointed out.
 
 Chellappa also indirectly attacked the present government saying that many promises are yet to be fulfilled. “It was announced during the MGR centenary celebrations that Mattuthavani bus stand would be named after MGR and the two new bridges after MGR and Jayalalithaa, but no government order has been passed to this effect till date,” he said.
 
 He also alleged that no work was being undertaken in his constituency, Madurai North and added that the government should make adequate fund allocations to ensure that developmental activities continued. Requests made to the CM to allocate funds the constituency was also not heeded to, he claimed. TNN
