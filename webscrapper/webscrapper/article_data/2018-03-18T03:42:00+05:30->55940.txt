Vijayawada: With the turn of the century,   have been excelling in traditionally male-dominated professions. 

  From loco pilots to coach technicians, women are giving stiff competition to their male counterparts in Vijayawada   division.
 
 A highly skilled team of 15 women technicians at the carriage and wagon workshop in Vijayawada have earned the reputation of being able to overhaul coaches on their own. Covered in grease, these women have attained expertise in operating coach lifting cranes, welding and even carrying heavy equipment like the bolster springs. 
 
 Most of them have experience of at least 10 years and have risen to the rank of senior technicians from being normal Kalasi helpers. Officials said the workshop gets around 40 coaches for overhauling every month. A team of 45 members, including women and men technicians handle the work.
 
 On the occasion of International Women’s Day, the Vijayawada division entrusted the entire work to the women to overhaul coaches. Speaking to TOI, additional divisional railway manager (ADRM – Operations) G Sumana pointed out that women are now able to compete with their male counterparts in mechanical works. “Women do the same amount of work as men in the workshop, it is now a common sight to find them covered in grease, doing intense labour at the mechanic shed. This is an empowering sight,” Sumana told TOI.
 
 Every coach has to go through intermediate overhaul every nine months. This includes a thorough inspection of almost each bolt and pin at the bottom of the train. Along with this, it also includes cleaning, painting, replacing damaged parts and also servicing the springs and wheels.
 
 “We work between from 7.30 am to 5 pm (including lunch break). Along with overhauling of coaches, we also do a lot of miscellaneous works like fixing various parts that reach the workshop,” a 45-year-old P Ramanamma, a senior technician told TOI.
