This year, Bengaluru, which was considered to be one of the safest cities for women to be in India, made news for incidents involving sexual assault and molestation involving women. This has challenged the safe city status and almost branded it with the ‘unsafe’ tag. 

 Popular Kannada rapper Rahul Dit-O’s latest song is a reaction to this mass hysteria and is a step towards assuring that Bengaluru is safe, with these incidents being stray ones. 
 
 “I was personally very angered when I read reports that were showing Bengaluru in such poor light. I agree that such incidents should be condemned, but things were being blown out of proportion. This led me to think about the situation and I came up with this song titled  . We’ve recently shot the video for the song, which should be out soon. My aim was to assure that Bengaluru and Bengalureans will remain the same — helpful, accommodating people, and that people should stop branding the city as unsafe,” says Rahul.
