PATNA: As the marker of hope for the people of state in the New Year, deputy CM   said on Monday the involvement of middlemen would be eliminated from various government schemes. He also said the implementation of schemes meant for the agriculture sector would increase the income of farmers.

 Exchanging New Year greetings with ministers, MLAs, MLCs and   functionaries as well as government officials at his residence, SuMo said the government decision of transferring money through direct benefit transfer (DBT) to the beneficiaries of various government schemes would help in eliminating the middlemen.
 
 He said the work on separate agriculture feeder to provide electricity to farmers has already begun. It is being implemented under the central scheme. The completion of the project would end the dependence of farmers on diesel for irrigation purposes and, accordingly, reduce income cost incurred on farming activities,   said.
 
 The completion of electrification in the remaining habitations and the power connection to every household would finally help in pulling the people of the state from ‘lalten (lantern)’ age. The scheme to give power connection to every household and electrify the remaining villages involves an expenditure of Rs3,030 crore, he added. 
 
 The thrust on the agriculture road map for 2017-22 is on integrated farming. In pursuance of the same, the farmers would be encouraged to go for  ,  , horticulture, cattle rearing, fishery and poultry, which would increase their income, Modi added.
