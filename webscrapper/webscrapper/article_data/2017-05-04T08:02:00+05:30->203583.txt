Shimla: Shimla municipal corporation elections will be conducted without any party symbols after a long span of 30 years, which might give a tough time to the party representatives in publicising themselves.

 Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan said he cannot appreciate the Congress and the BJP for taking the irrelevant decision of indirect elections. “We have these two demands from the state government. Firstly, like previous years, the elections should be conducted with symbols which will help in knowing the categories of winners in parties and secondly like previous 2012 elections, these elections should also be direct,” he added.
 
 Nabha ward councillor Shashi Shekar said the state government has made this year’s elections very confusing and complicated to the voters and the parties by changing statements. “Initially, the wards were increased from 25 to 34 in a very haphazard way, then there were problems in voters list that are not sorted even now, then some leaders’ right to contest elections was snatched and now the elections would be held without party symbols. Party symbols helps the voters in knowing who exactly they are voting for,” he added.
 
 Benmore ward councillor Anup Vaid said, “As this time only BJP party is going to be on the top, every weird activity of the Congress government including their idea of conducting symbol less elections is showing their fear of losing.”
