Vadodara: One person died and three were injured when a tempo carrying milk rammed into a parked vehicle near a Hanuman Temple near Wadi on Friday morning. The incident occurred when some people were standing near a roadside stall at 3.30am. A van carrying milk from the Baroda Dairy came at full speed from the Pratapnagar Road and suddenly swerved to its left. 

 The police said that driver of the van lost control of the vehicle. The van rammed into another tempo that was parked outside the Bhidbhanjan Temple and also knocked down a two-wheeler. Forty-two-year-old Rupesh Shah, who was standing near the parked van, got run over and died on the spot. Three others identified as Abid Sheikh, Raju Rabari and Sanjay Nikam suffered injuries. 
 
 Shah, who is a singer, had gone to a programme and was returning home late on Thursday night. He went to a roadside stall for having some snacks when the accident happened. Fire brigade officials too rushed to the spot apart from the police that registered a case of rash driving leading to the death of Shah. Locals said that drivers of vans carrying milk often drive very rashly early in the mornings as the roads are clear and there are no traffic police around.
 
 The spot where the accident occurred often sees a lot of crowd even late in the night as people visit the roadside stalls here to have some snacks.
