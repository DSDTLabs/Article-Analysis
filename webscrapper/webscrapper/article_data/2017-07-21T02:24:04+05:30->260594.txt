NEW DELHI: Blaming China for trying to change the status of the India-Bhutan-China tri-junction, minister for external affairs   on Thursday ruled out unilateral withdrawal of Indian troops as is being insisted on by an increasingly belligerent Beijing.

 Responding to queries during question hour in the Rajya Sabha, Swaraj said China’s attempt to build a road through Bhutan posed a security challenge to India. She ruled out meeting Beijing’s demand for a pullout of Indian troops as a condition for deescalation on the   plateau.
 
 The external affairs minister referred to China’s insistence and said: “India wants that all troops are removed from the tri-junction point before discussing the issue together. All countries, including Bhutan, are with us.”
 
 “Their (China’s) intention was to reach the tri-junction so that they could unilaterally end the status of the tri-junction. It was only then that India came into the picture. If China unilaterally changes the tri-junction point, then India’s security is challenged,” she said.
 
 The day saw China repeating its demand that India call back its troops as the first step towards resolution of tension. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters that “our diplomatic channel is unimpeded”, an indication that the two sides were talking to defuse the crisis.
