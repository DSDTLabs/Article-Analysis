Palanpur: About 15,000 people, including women and children, on Tuesday took an oath to stop female foeticide at the police ground of Mehsana. They also pledged not to have indifferent attitude towards girls. 

 The function was organized during Krushi Mahotsav in Mehsana. 
 
 “Krushi Mahotsav is a proper place to entice people from rural Gujarat,” said Paavan Solanki, who had organized the event. He later presented the certificate of 15,000 taking oath against female foeticide to deputy chief minister Nitin Patel. tnn
