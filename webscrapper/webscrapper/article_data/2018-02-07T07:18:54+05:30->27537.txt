AHMEDABAD: The   stayed a government order   of  , for violation of the two-child norm.

 The judges, however, asked the councillor, Firoz Rathod, to make a clear declaration about birth of his fourth child, after the court found him “ambivalent” in this regard.
 
 Rathod was elected councillor in November 2015. He declared in his nomination papers that he had three children, all of them born before the cut-off date of 2005, when the two-child norm came into effect for local self-government elections in Gujarat.
 
 Rathod’s rival candidates filed election petitions, demanding that he be disqualified, claiming that a fourth child was born to his wife in 2007. They were late in approaching the courts and therefore their pleas were turned down. Later, a complaint before the district collector led to Rathod’s disqualification in December 2017. He has now challenged the district collector’s order on the ground that he could not have passed the order under section 38 of the Panchayat Act.
