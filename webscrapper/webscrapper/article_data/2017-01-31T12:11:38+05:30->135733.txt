TRICHY: There is good news amid the gloom of an ongoing legal battle between activists and an  's home in the city. One of the 89 girls in the controversial  's home in Trichy will enter into wedlock on Monday, marking the first case of a female inmate of the home moving out in the wake of a   order. 

 On November 30, a division bench of justices S Nagamuthu and MV Muralidharan had passed an order granting freedom to the 89 inmates, most of them adult women now, to decide their future. 
 
 The proposed marriage caused some excitement among couples, whose DNA samples matched with that of several children. These parents had abandoned the baby girls. 
 
 Esther, 25, one of three siblings, who grew up in the home, will marry Gladis, 27, a sound engineer, in Trichy on January 30. Gladis works in a church run by the children's home. Esther's parents had abandoned her and her two sisters when they were barely toddlers nearly two decades ago. 
 
 The home, run by pastor Gideon Jacob, was dragged into a controversy in 2015 after activists discovered that all the 89 inmates were living in the unauthorized home. All 89 were "rescued" by the pastor from families living in villages around  , a region notorious for infanticide. 
 
 "It's an arranged marriage and the bridegroom has come forward to marry Esther and give her a new life. Esther, who has completed bachelor of theology, is agreeable to the marriage," Dr R Anburaj of the children's home told TOI on Sunday. 
 
 "Initially, Gladis's family raised some objections. But, we convinced them and they have now agreed to the betrothal," he said.
 
 The marriage of Esther and Gladis will be solemnized in the church belonging to the Mose Ministries home on Monday morning.   has been invited to grace the marriage. 
 
 Palanisamy said the administration received information about the marriage and it was communicated to the court. "The court had no objection," he said.
