MUMBAI: The   and   are at loggerheads once again. This time, the issue is opening up of salt pan lands in Mumbai to create space for the chief minister's pet affordable housing plan. 

 
  State environment minister and Sena leader   said that his party will oppose the move and will not let salt pans be opened up for affordable housing projects. Kadam raised the issue at a cabinet meeting held on Wednesday and was supported by other Sena ministers. 
 
 The state government recently passed the city's development plan in which 300 hectares of salt pan land has been allocated for affordable housing. Kadam said salt pans serve as natural buffers during rains and high tides and are hence, required for environmental balance. 
 
 "I have been informed that the Centre will give its nod to the proposal any time now. I have met the CM and discussed the issue with him," said Kadam. 
 
 "When the Urban Land Ceiling Regulation Act was in force, why were public housing projects not taken up. The government must first look at all those cases," he said. Until the state repealed the land ceiling law in 2007, individuals in urban areas could own over 500 sqm residential land only if they permitted public housing on 5% of land. Such land, around 1,850 acres in the city and another 4,000 acres in the metropolitan region, was never handed over for public housing by developers.
 
 Earlier,   leader   had written a blog against the state's plan to "monetise" salt pans. He had said that this will lead to killing Mumbai environmentally.
