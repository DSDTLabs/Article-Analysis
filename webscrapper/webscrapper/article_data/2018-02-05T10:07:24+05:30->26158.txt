THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: When   was conceived in 1981, the total estimate was Rs 17 crore. The project was envisaged to irrigate an extent of 14,394 hectares of wet and dry land and 13,209 hectares of cultivable command area. In 1992, the estimate of the project was revised to Rs 107 crore. But even after 37 years after the launch, the project is still ‘in progress’ and the government has spent Rs 333 crore on it. As per the performance budget of water resources department tabled in the assembly by finance minister  , along with the budget for current fiscal, at least Rs 600 crore will be required for land acquisition alone to complete the project.

 Edamalayar is a detailed case study in the performance budget report which also includes a similar tale of   irrigation project. Major projects like Muvattupuzha valley and Pamba valley irrigation projects also found a mention in the report thanks to notorious delays. “Edamalayar project is a typical example for the improper planning and slackening approach instead of wilfully implementing a project,” said the report. While calling for a new approach and fresh planning on the project, the report listed insufficient technical staff and excess staff in some sections as reasons that contributed to the failure of the project.
 
 The financial inspection team visited a deviation canal constructed as part of the project. For constructing the 150 metre long canal, Rs 5.50 crore was spent. “It is shocking,” noted the inspection team. The link canal which was supposed to connect   barrage to   branch canal and is a major component of the project is yet to be completed, finds the report. “Of the 7.575 km length, 4.782 km is still to be completed,” the report said.
 
  
 Karappuzha irrigation project in   launched in 1978 had an initial estimate of Rs 7.60 crore. When it was partially commissioned on October 16, 2010 – after 32 years of launch – the estimate was revised to Rs. 441.50 crore. In 2017, the estimate was further revised to Rs 560 crore. “It shows lack of proper planning. Almost all project works of irrigation department have such a history,” the report said. Seven hectares of land needed to complete the work of Karappuzha project reservoir is yet to be acquired. The report also said that 68 tribal families evacuated from the project area are still awaiting proper rehabilitation.
 
 
 The performance budget report also found that the Kerala Water Authority didn’t utilise the budgetary allocation fully in 2016-17. Out of the Rs 412.50 crore state plan, only Rs 255.09 crore was used by the authority in 2016-17. In 2015-16, around 95% of the allocation was used. The utilisation of JICA aid for Jalanidhi second phase was even pathetic. Out of Rs 150 crore granted in 16-17 for JICA project, only 47.93 crore was utilised. For Nabard-aided projects, out of Rs 110 crore sanctioned, only Rs 88.30 crore was used by   in 2016-17.
 
 
 The report also raises concern about the depleting ground water level in the state. “Because of the increased urbanisation and reclamation of paddy fields, the chances of recharging of ground water is very limited. Hence implementation of artificial recharge structures is the only solution to enhance ground water table,” the report said adding that the ground water department should take the initiative to recharge wells. The state has around 65 lakh wells.
