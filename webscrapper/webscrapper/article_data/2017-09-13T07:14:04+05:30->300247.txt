KOLKATA: Eleven encroachers, who had stalled   work on the New Garia-Airport stretch at   near Baghajatin rail overbridge, have finally been evicted for the construction of a viaduct. This is the first time in the recent past that illegal structures have been successfully demolished for any Metro project in Kolkata.

 As the encroachers refused to vacate the irrigation department land, a launching girder weighing more than 400 tonnes hung precariously mid-air for the last four months. Afcons, the construction agency, also threatened to leave the project.
 
 “But thanks to mayor  , the structures were demolished without any hassle. This will facilitate completion of the alignment. But I must admit that suspension of work four months led to the loss of momentum the project had gained," said  , executive director of RVNL, the executing agency of the New Garia- Aiport project. Along with Chatterjee, mayor-in-council (solid waste management) Malay Majumdar also took a proactive role in removing the hurdle.
 
 The demolition will now allow the contractor to launch the 28m viaduct to bridge piers 20 and 21. This is a crucial section from where the Metro corridor moves from EM Bypass towards New Garia to merge with the North-South line at Kavi Subhas station. 
 
 Local councillor (ward 109) Ananya Banerjee, who played a key role to facilitate the demolition, was happy with the development. “A Metro project is always high on our priority list. This is why we clearly told the squatters that they had to move out. We are now trying to rehabilitate them along E M Bypass. We had a meeting on last Tuesday where police, KMC and RVNL took the decision to demolish the illegal structures." 
 
 “We are on the vested land just like many other occupants. We have trade licences and electricity bills. Why were we issued these documents if we are illegal encroaching upon the land? Hopefully, KMC will rehabilitate us immediately," said Tapas Sen, one of the 11 evictees.
