NAGPUR: “Though women writers of modern era pour their heart out to express themselves by taking up various issues not hitherto touched upon, the standard of writing is declining by the day. A feeling of self-satisfaction that has set in is responsible for such degradation,” said  , an eminent littérateur, on Saturday.

 Speaking at a national level seminar on ‘Women writers from Vidarbha and their work’, organized jointly by Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal and   at Nandanvan, Ganorkar said, “Feminism is excessively reflected in the writings of littérateurs from Vidarbha.”
 
 “It is time that women writers come up with innovative ideas and tackle various other issues in their work by doing extensive research before rushing to publish articles or books. This trend is detrimental to creative writing which requires years of study and pondering,” she said.
 
 Collections of poems and novels are piling up each day but these are read by a handful of people as most of the works lack quality and depth, she said. What writers today need is not to join the bandwagon of ‘also ran’; they should focus on producing a literature that would last long, she added. Women writers should not yield to the demands of publishers and compromise on the content of stories.
 
 She said, “Indian women should read other authors too as it broadens the horizons. We should understand our flaws and improvise after comparing our work.” 
 
 Vice-chancellor of   said, “I have a background of statistics but I am fond of reading. It has been observed that great mathematicians are also good writers and vice versa, although the fields are poles apart. 
 
 In his presidential address, Ravindra Fadnavis from   said, “Such seminars motivate women authors and acknowledge their work.” 
 
 Present on the occasion were Shripad Joshi, Indrajeet Orke and Vilas Deshpande. Shubhada Fadnavis conducted the programme while Mrunalini Fadnavis proposed a vote of thanks.
