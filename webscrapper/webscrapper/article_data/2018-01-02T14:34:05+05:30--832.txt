PANAJI: A new design for the new   bridge’s ‘super-structure’ — or upper half — is now ready. It has been prepared after the finalization of the bridge’s  , which had to be changed after variation in data was found during   of the site. 

 The new eight-lane bridge, besides serving as an expressway of sorts between Goa’s two districts, is also conceptualised as a major tourist attraction. While a viewing tower and restaurant is expected atop the structure, officials said that this hasn’t been designed and neither has the work been allotted, as the central government, which is funding the project, is first waiting for the bridge to near completion. 
 
 “Visually, the bridge design looks the same as during the conceptualisation stage,” said officials. “The design has only undergone technical changes.”
 
 The bridge work is expected to speed up now that ‘hard surface’ to carry out piling for the bridge has been found and exact positions for the pillars established. 
 
 “Working in the water is the most difficult part,” the official said. “The piling work in the water, which is the most critical part, is now expected to be completed by February. Once this is done, as good as 50% of the bridge work would have been achieved.” 
 
 A fabrication unit for the bridge work has been set up parallel to the  , below the current Zuari bridge. To make the two four-lane carriageways for the bridge, composite deck slabs of steel girders with precast concrete slabs on top will be used. The steel girders will be fabricated at the unit set up at the site, using advanced robotic welding equipment. 
 
 The steel girders of the cable-stayed bridge will be metallised to prevent their corrosion. Also, the bridge’s cables will be covered with yellow-coloured pipes, that will give its super-structure an aesthetically-pleasing yellow-coloured look.
