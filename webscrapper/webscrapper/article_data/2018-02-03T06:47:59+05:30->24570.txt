KOLKATA: The Kolkata   Rail Corporation ( ) on Thursday inspected 9 and 10 Old Court House Street to find out if the buildings were safe enough to live in even as the residents stood outside to get a date for their return.

 Oblivious to the precarious state of the buildings, the occupants have been rallying for their return to their homes since Monday. Even as Kolkata Municipal Corporation ( ) is unsure whether it would be proper for the 40-odd people to re-enter their dilapidated homes once the tunnel boringmachine (TBM) — that’s burrowing the east-bound tunnel for the East West Metro connectivity — digs past the house, KMRC is trying its best not to get into any kind of controversy. “We don’t want to create any problems for anybody,” a senior KMRC official said.
 
 
 KMRC general manager (administration) AK Nandy on Thursday asked the anxious residents to wait outside while they inspected the buildings. The two TBMs are currently building the twin tunnels for the Metro corridor below these ramshackle structures. The machines are likely to move past the houses by Saturday.
 
 The evacuees, 26 of whom have been put up in a hotel by KMRC, were initially supposed to return on January 19. With the evacuation period being extended twice, their day of return has now been slated for Tuesday. “The KMRC GM has assured us that we will be allowed in the building only if it is found stable after the second TBM crosses the structure,” said Baidyanath De, administrator, J Sur & Co, one of the 10 Old Court House Street shops, now closed.
 
 Sources revealed that parts of the building gave way even before the east-bound TBM could approach. As burrowing started, KMRC and construction agency   had to fortify the buildings and the 12-ft-wide pavement to prevent accidents.
 
 As portions of the buildings keep collapsing, utmost care is being taken. But the structures are too vulnerable to withstand the minimal disturbance created by the TBM to the surrounding ground.
