 has taken on the mantle of playing the real life don, Arun Gawli, in the upcoming biopic ' '. After starring in Sujoy Ghosh’s hard-hitting film ' ' last year, Arjun has once again opted for a narrative that hinges on realism. Ask him if he is drawn to these roles and the actor says, “I prefer realism unless it's a fantasy film where one has to create one's own reality. In case of 'Kahaani 2', Sujoy was keen that I played the role with a certain air of nonchalance. What’s intriguing about playing   is the duality in his personality. He was not referred to as 
 , don or 
 . Instead, he was referred to as daddy — which reflects endearment. When I met the people who worked with him, they had a lot love and respect for him. And when I met Arun Gawli, I realised what makes him an endearing man. He is gentle, polite and well-mannered. But, obviously there is something very dark in his personality too. I wanted to play the role as close to reality and then leave it to the audience to judge if he is a daddy or a gangster.”
