HYDERABAD: Municipal Administration minister KT Rama Rao said road laying and recarpeting works are being taken up at a cost of Rs 1120 crore in   (GHMC) limits, to be completed by June 15. He said the state government was striving to provide good roads and infrastructure facilities in all colonies in Greater Hyderabad.

 
 The minister on Tuesday inaugurated the city’s first modern AC bus shelter at Shilparamam and laid foundation for road works at HMT Hills, Allwyn Colony at Yellammabanda, Vivekanandanagar and Sumitranagar bus stop.   said the city would have at least 30 such bus shelters with ultra-modern facilities, including coffee machines, Wi-fi and mobile charging points.
 
 “The most attractive in the Grade 1 Bus Shelter, opposite Oracle in   city area, is the exclusive “baby feeding room” for mothers of infants..this facility is not restricted to passengers..this is meant for moms who pass by the area also,” KTR said. Another feature of this bus shelter is an SoS button which will alert a command centre in case of emergencies, he added.
 
 GHMC has handed over 826 bus shelters, 400 existing ones, and another 400 being newly built, to four different agencies on DBFOT basis through tender process. They will erect shelters at new sites and replace existing shelters with new ones with modern designs and amenities.
 
 KTR said the state government was giving priority to basic amenities in colonies and slums. “During summer, in earlier governments, water crisis and power problem were common. People held dharnas at the water board office every summer. Now, it is a thing of past. Both issues have been resolved permanently,” he said.
 
 Transport minister P Mahender Reddy, Mayor Bonthu Rammohan, GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy, and others were present.
