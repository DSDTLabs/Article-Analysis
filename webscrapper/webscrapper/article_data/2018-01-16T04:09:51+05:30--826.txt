MUMBAI: Opposition leaders and civil society will march from   near Mantralaya to Gateway of India on January 26 against the BJP government’s alleged attempts to undermine the Constitution. The ‘Samvidhan Bachao’

 
 (Save the Constitution) march, spearheaded by NCP chief Sharad Pawar and independent MP  , will be attended by CPM general secretary  , former JD(U) member Sharad Yadav, Patidar quota agitation spearhead Hardik Patel, Congress   Jignesh Thakor, Dalit rights activist and MLA Jignesh Mevani, Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson  , and journalists Nikhil Wagle and Kumar Ketkar, among others. The city police said they received a request for permission for the march on Monday and are yet to make a decision. During the recent Dalit agitation, cops did not allow Mevani to address a student’s plenary.
 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Yechury said: “In one BJP-ruled state after another, private armies are running riot. This march is against the blatant undermining of the constitutional provisions of equality and freedom with the BJP in state after state attempting to control the way people eat, dress or behave.”
 
 
 Last-minute preparations are being overseen by NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad and Raju Shetty, who conceived of the rally. “We are protesting, through this march, the government’s attempts to amend the Indian Constitution, as stated by Union minister Anant Kumar Hegde. If only inadvertently, the government’s plans have been laid bare in his comments,” said Shetty, the MP who fell out with the BJP last year. Organisers said the march will end in a silent protest and a sit-in at Gateway and the leaders will unanimously decide how to scale up the protest.
