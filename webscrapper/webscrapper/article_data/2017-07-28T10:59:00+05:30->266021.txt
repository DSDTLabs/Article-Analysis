 PSPCL’s west zone chief engineer Harpal Singh Khurmi said, “Aiming to catch those stealing power, we had started conducting raids nearly a fortnight ago. We detected 1,328 cases of power theft and running of power meters at lower loads than permissible. We have written to anti-power theft police station to register cases against the defaulters. He said the PSPCL teams were conducting searches in the region to ensure the power theft was stopped and raise the revenue of the corporation.
 
 A resident of   village in Lambi said, “Ever since the   has formed government in Punjab, many of the households have stopped using ‘kundi’ connections with fear of getting caught.”
