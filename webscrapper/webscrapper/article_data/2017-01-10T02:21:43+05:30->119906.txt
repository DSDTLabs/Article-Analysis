NEW DELHI: Starting Tuesday, Delhi’s homeless will be introduced to skills that can empower them with dignified employment opportunities. The initiative will be started at 10 night shelters where the homeless men and women will be trained by qualified teachers in skills ranging from basic sewing, beauty culture, plumbing, electrical work and a crash   in simple cooking.

 The courses spanning three months will conclude with participants getting certificates to enable them to seek employment beyond working as daily wage labourers. The participants will be assessed for their skills and granted certificates on completion of the course by Delhi government.
 
 The project will be started at high population density shelters at Raja Garden, Regarpura in Karol Bagh, A-Block Motia Khan, Yamuna Bazar, Parda Bagh in Darya Ganj, Fatehpuri in Chandni Chowk, Chabi Ganj in   area and Sarai Kale Khan.
 
 The launch of the project will see the newly-appointed LG Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal come together to inaugurate the skill centre at Tilak Nagar. This will be the first public appearance of the CM and LG together.
 
 This coming together over a matter involving social welfare is significant considering that the AAP government’s equation with the previous LG was marked by an ugly tussle over powers of the state versus the Centre.
 
 The training programme is a tripartite venture between department of training and technical education (TTE), Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and   (SMAs) drawn from NGOs working with the homeless.
 
 DUSIB will provide the infrastructure, like space, while finances for training, equipment and faculty will be given by department of TTE. The SMAs will pick the candidates and execute the programme. There will be about 25 participants in a course.
 
 “TTE has attached each course to the nearest ITI for technical support. The ITIs will issue certificates to each successful candidate,” said an official.
