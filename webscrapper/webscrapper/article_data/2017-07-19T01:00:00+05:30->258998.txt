The north-eastern girl,   Buragohain, Yamaha Fascino - Miss Diva 2016 2nd runner-up, was in town recently to judge the fbb Campus Princess Lucknow auditions. Visiting the city for the first time, she was in awe of the people and kebabs of the Nawabi city.
"I have been hearing about Lucknow kebabs over the years and as soon as I landed here I was searching for kebabs in the land of nawabs. That was my   status also this morning. I had the kebabs this morning but I'm still looking to have more of them. I have one more day in Lucknow and I will go around the city. I am looking to do some shopping, especially for chikan," says Aradhana.
 Talking about the hospitality and the people of the nawabi city, she says, "The people here are lovely, they have been so good to me that I am in love with Lucknow and would really love to come back to the city for a longer visit." 
 While most of her predecessors have headed the   way, Aradhana is charting a different course for herself. "I have done an Assamese movie but as of now I have no plans for Bollywood as I am concentrating more on modelling," she says.
