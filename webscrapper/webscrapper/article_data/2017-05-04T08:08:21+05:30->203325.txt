New Delhi: The   is considering allowing counting of printed paper slips generated by voter-verifiable   trail (VVPAT) units in select cases in all future polls. The   count will be tallied with EVM results in a move aimed at reassuring voters, parties and candidates about the accuracy and non-tamperability of  . 

 As of now, a VVPAT count is allowed only if a written request is made by the candidate, his election agent or counting agent to the returning officer. The returning officer must, after taking various factors into consideration, issue written orders as to whether the count is to be taken or not.   now proposes to relax the counting rules to allow counting of VVPAT slips in select polling stations or constituencies at its own initiative, apart from also doing so at the request of the candidate or his agent. 
 
 "VVPAT have been introduced to ensure greater transparency in poll process. Not only will the voter be able to see a paper slip displaying the candidatehe has chosen, but he may also be offered the facility of checking if the total votes recorded in an EVM match those recorded in VVPAT slips. This will allay doubts regarding EVMs' tamperability," a senior EC functionary told TOI. 
 
 An EC officer said the proposed changes in counting rules may be discussed at an all-party meeting planned next week to discuss doubts regarding EVMs as well as
 modalities of the upcoming EVM hackathon. “Now that all future assembly and Lok Sabha poll are likely to be fully VVPAT-based, it makes sense to relax the counting rules to allow for more VVPAT counts to be tallied with EVM results.
 
 However, we must strike a balance between need for greater transparency and keeping the counting process fast,” said the officer.
