LUDHIANA: As the election date approaches nearer and campaigning reaches its peak, more and more   are coming to the fore.

 Despite several checks from district administration, the presence of   of candidates of different parties on city walls has increased.
 
 Not only the candidates, but even printing press owners are disobeying the instructions of   which clearly state that they will to have mention the name and licence number of the printing press, contact number, total number of posters printed on the posters. But there are very few who are following the instructions.
 
 Describing the problem, Kitchlu Nagar-based Pankaj Sharma said, “There are posters of candidates contesting elections from West constituency on every wall in the locality. We wake up in the morning to see posters pasted outside our house. We have removed these posters several times, but these reappear the next day.” He said nobody is taking strict action against candidates for defacing public and private properties.
 
 A resident from Yash Colony, Veena Kapoor rued, “Even as election is few days away, the number of posters has increased. Our newly painted wall was defaced by supporters of political parties with posters. In some of the areas the supporters of one candidate remove the posters of other candidate and then paste their own posters.”
 
 The administration claimed that it has removed a large number of posters and banners in city and their drive is still going on. District election officer-cum-deputy commissioner   said that staff has been deputed to remove these posters and banners from everywhere. In the past few days, they have removed 80,000 posters.
 
 He claimed that they would also take action against the erring printing press owners if caught red handed and they would also cancel the licence of the printing press if found guilty.
