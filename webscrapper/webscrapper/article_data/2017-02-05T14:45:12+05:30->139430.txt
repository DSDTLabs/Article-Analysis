KOZHIKODE: A day after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former prime minister of Pakistan, was hanged to death in 1979 April,   drew a cartoon portraying  , ‘walking along the ‘milestones’ of military onslaught on democracy. And the caption read, ‘And now for a quiet stroll down memory lane’, which subtly said what could be the fate of the general who ordered the execution.

 Many such milestone cartoons, under the title ‘Tragic idiom’, are on display at the venue of the   (KLF) here, which asserts the significance of the cartoons of Vijayan, even today.
 
 “There are some cartoons by Vijayan, which are relevant today even the Kerala scenario, and that is why people are able to appreciate it,” said eminent cartoonist  , whose works on display at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale.
 
 If the captions given by Vijayan, who often followed the global development, were used along with all the cartoons and displayed with a breathing space, it could have been more comfortable for the cartoon lovers to watch it, he opined.
 
 Though cartoons are supposed to have short shelf life, Vijayan’s cartoons, done many years back, are still watched is an indication of the perennial nature of his works, said writer N S Madhavan, who said cartoon is still being appreciated by the readers, and the people’s interest in graphic novels is a pointer in this regard.
