   secretary   on Thursday derided defence minister   for “sleeping” in the Rajya Sabha, when PM Narendra Modi was debating on the President’s address on Wednesday.
 
  “Being a defence minister is a full-time job the country’s minister should be alert at all times. Here we have a defence minister who has been caught napping many times in  . It looks like it’s the Prime Minister himself who discharges the duties of the defence minister,” Chodankar said, and invited him to return to Goa, so that he can get “enough time to sleep”.
  
  Chodankar also took a dig at Parrikar’s recent statements that the large turnout of women at the February polls indicated that the “womenfolk would stand by the party”.
  
  “If they think by giving 1,500 as doles to housewives, they would vote for them and would win them elections, the BJP has only made the women subservient. This is an insult to the women of Goa and their self-honour,” Chodankar said.
