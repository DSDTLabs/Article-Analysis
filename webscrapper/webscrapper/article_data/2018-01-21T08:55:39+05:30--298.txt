HYDERABAD: Metro services from Nagole to   stretch has no impact on the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation(TSRTC).   said neither its revenues nor number of passengers have come down due to the Metro services.

 TSRTC Greater Hyderabad zone chief manager Komaraiah told TOI, “RTC services are not affected by Metro. Our figures are the same. Maybe if the Metro starts services to Hi-Tec City and other corridors, we may be impacted in June 2018. What we were told is that most of the passengers on the Metro are joy riders.” RTC runs around 3,500 buses across Hyderabad.
 
 “Good that RTC occupancy is not affected. Our idea is to attract commuters using private vehicles and not from RTC which is another public transport organization,”NVS Reddy, Hyderabad Metro MD told STOI “Around 20 per cent Metro passengers may be joyriders. We have to assess the impact when all corridors are open. We have suggested making Metro line eight shaped by connecting Hi-Tec City with Miyapur and LB Nagar with Nagole in the second phase,” Traffic and   consultant Dr T S Reddy said.
