Following the   tragedy in   on May 16, the state government has decided to implement a few rules from September 1 to avert such accidents. For instance, no boat will be allowed to ferry passengers or transport goods without being certified under the Inland Vessels Act, issued by the Andhra Pradesh Ports department. 

 The government is also planning on constituting an Inland Vessels Transport Regulatory Authority in the state.
 
 The decision was taken by the chief secretary of the state   during a meet with officials from the irrigation department, AP ports department and representatives from Boat Operatorsâ€™ Association in   on Friday.
 
 During the meet it was decided that temporary licenses will be issued to boats plying in Godavari River till August 31. Only after vessels are inspected properly that permanent licenses would be issued. All kinds of boats in the state should have the permissions and the licenses issued by the ports department. 
 
 The boats, which are in good condition would be allowed to ferry passengers in a reduced capacity.
 
 For cargo boats, permissions to carry less than 10 tonnes of cargo would be given by the irrigation department and above 10 tonne-capacity boats will have to get the permission from the ports department under Inland Vessels Act. 
 
 The AP Ports director Koya Praveen said that around 70% of the boats plying in   have been given permissions under Inland Vessels Act, while boats plying in River Godavari, have not yet approached the department for permissions to ply their boats.
