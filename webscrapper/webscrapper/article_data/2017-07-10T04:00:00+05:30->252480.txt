Ahmedabad: Guru Purnima was celebrated with fervour across the state on Sunday. Guru Purnima is traditionally celebrated by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists to honour gurus or teachers who guide us through our lives towards the path of enlightenment. The day is marked on the full-moon day of the Hindu month Ashadha, which falls between June and July. 

 “Guru Purnima is a day to express our gratitude to people who have significantly influenced our life,” chief minister Vijay Rupani tweeted. He celebrated the Guru Purnima Mahotsav at the temple of the Swaminarayan sect at Vadtaldham in Kheda district. In Ahmedabad, many people sought blessings of Jagannath temple priest Dilipdasji Maharaj. Dilipdasji told his disciples that their responsibility to conserve the legacy of the city has increased because it has got the World Heritage Site status.
