CHENNAI: A 22-year-old who reportedly posed as a woman on   to woo a police constable as part of a bid to con him out of money was killed by the latter in Tamil Nadu’s Virudhunagar district this week, police said. 

 
 The 32-year-old constable, Kannan Kumar, attached with the Ennore police station in Chennai, had three accomplices in the crime and is now on the run. Kumar had taken 10 days’ leave over the Pongal holidays to visit his hometown   (Watrap), less than 5km from W  , where the murder occurred, to meet the person he believed to be his online lover. 
 
 It was then that he realised he had been ripped off by victim S Ayyanar, an investigating officer said. “Police have arrested the three accomplices, Vijayakumar, Tenzing alias Tamilarasan, and another person named Tamilarasan, and charged them with S Ayyanar’s murder,” the officer said. “They confessed during interrogation,” he added. Ayyanar, a teaching student, had created a woman’s fake profile on Facebook, where he started an online relationship with Kumar. “They even voice-chatted... Ayyanar disguised his voice... the constable soon came to believe he was in love with this person,” the officer said. 
 
 While on leave, Kumar sought a meeting since they lived close by, but Ayyanar refused, Virudhunagar superintendent of police M   said. This caused Kumar to get suspicious and, after conducting checks through his friends, he realised he had been cheated. Kumar slipped into depression and attempted suicide by consuming poison. 
 
 He was hospitalised. “When his friends came to visit him in hospital, the constable hatched a plan to exact revenge,” SP Rajarajan said, “Kumar and his friends kidnapped Ayyanar and hacked him to death.” Chennai police said the constable had been on medical leave since December 12. “We learned about the murder... on Wednesday,” Ennore police inspector Sathyan said, “Kumar has been attached to the law and order wing here since April 2016.”
