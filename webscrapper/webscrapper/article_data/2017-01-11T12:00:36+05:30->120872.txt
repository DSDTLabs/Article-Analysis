HUBBALLI: Referring to the alleged assault cases against   MLA   and   MP  , and controversial remarks by   MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, senior   leader   said that a mistake committed by anyone is a mistake. He said that the BJP condemns such acts. “We have discussed these matters with BJP state president B Y Yeddyurappa and he will take appropriate action against these representatives,” he said.

 He called upon elected representatives to abide by law and become role model for commoners. Commenting on the appointment of Lokayukta, he said that the government takes suggestion from opposition leaders but neglects them while finalizing the name. “The last time, we had suggested name of Justice Vikram Sen, but it was dropped in the final list,” he said.
 
 Denying commenting on the appointment of Justice Vishwanath Shetty as the Lokayukta, Shettar said that if there is any allegation against Shetty, the government should review it.
 
 When asked about implementation of Justice Sadashiv commission recommendations, he said that the BJP had given consent to the proposals during the recent Madigara Mahasamavesh. “After that convention, we were approached by communities like Bhovi and Lambani, who alleged that the Justice Sadashiv report is misleading,” he said.
 
 “We suggest the government to convene a meeting. The chief minister should try to create consent among all the communities before implementing the commission’s recommendations,” he opined.
