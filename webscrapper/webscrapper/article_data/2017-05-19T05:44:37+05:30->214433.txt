New Delhi: One  , a  , claimed on Thursday that he owned four companies that donated Rs 2 crore to   in 2014, and which were claimed to be fake by sacked Delhi government minister Kapil Mishra. 

 In his “expose” on May 14, Mishra had alleged that Rs 2 crore had been paid through four cheques of Rs 50 lakh each by four shell companies. “I donated the money to AAP because I thought AAP has come into politics to serve the poor,” Sharma said in a video, which was shared around on Twitter and even re-tweeted by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
 
 Sharma rubbished the allegations that these were shell companies. “It’s a lie. The companies are genuine and the money I gave is also genuine,” he said. 
 
 Sharma also said that he didn’t come out in 2014 when questions had been raised about AAP’s sources of funding as he didn’t want to get involved in the controversy. 
 
 Mishra posted a counter on Twitter: “AAP has made this video go viral. I will expose the biggest lie of Kejriwal tomorrow.” 
 
 In another tweet, Mishra urged AAP workers to follow his “expose” on Friday.
