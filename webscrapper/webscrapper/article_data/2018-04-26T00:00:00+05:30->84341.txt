Like many others before her,   made the switch from television to the big screen with hopes of making a mark in cinema. Even though her debut, Huliraya, got mixed reviews, she was noticed and bagged several other projects shortly after. Her second film, Dhwaja, is set to release this week and while Divya is immensely proud to be a part of it, she admits that she was a bundle of nerves on the set. “My guru in cinema is director  , who made Huliraya and Dhwaja has been made by his guru,   sir. When I got the offer to work on the film after Ashok sir saw my performance in Huliraya, I was thrilled. But on the set I was really nervous, only to have Ashok sir reassure me and literally spoon feed me. Every scene, every movement was explained and sometimes even acted out by him for my reference. Working with him was like getting a master class in acting,” says the actress.
Dhwaja is the official Kannada remake of the Tamil political-thriller Kodi, which had   in a double role and paired with   and Anupama Parameswaran. While actor-producer Ravi Gowda takes on Dhanush’s role and   in Trisha’s, Divya plays Anupama’s character from the original.
 “The role is of a bubbly, girl-next-door, who sells eggs for a livelihood. I really liked the part, as she is very jovial and entertaining. Ashok sir had asked me to watch the original and it was only after that that I agreed to be a part of the remake. Ravi plays twin brothers in the film, one of who is paired with Priya ma’am and the other with me,” explains Divya.
 Next up, the actress is looking forward to Face2Face, which is in post-production and Joru, for which she is currently shooting for. Each of her films so far, says Divya, have offered her distinctively varied roles. “I have been lucky so far that my film roles are different from each other. I am really liking the work I am doing. In fact, when choosing scripts, I take them on only if I get a good vibe, and so far, all has been well,” she says.
