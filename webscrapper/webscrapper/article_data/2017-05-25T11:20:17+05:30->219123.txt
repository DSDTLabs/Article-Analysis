JAIPUR: The   directing the   to continue   received a mixed response from the students and teachers. Those supporting the court’s order say that unless a uniform evaluating scheme is in place, the   should continue with the moderation system.

 Rajkumari Sharma, a Class XII student awaiting result, said, “Court has rightly directed the board not to change the evaluating process. It is done in the interest of students.”
 
 TOI spoke to school principals who refused to come on record as neither they want to be seen going against the CBSE nor the Delhi High Court. “The grace marks affect the minuscule number of students. CBSE is known for its high standards and moderation is a blot on evaluating process,” said a school principal.
 
 Following the court direction of moderation of marks, HRD minister Prakash Javadekar extended support for moderation policy.
 
 Meanwhile, Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) has officially denied following moderation system from the last 4-5 years. However, the number of students scoring in 90% has registered 10 fold rises between 2013 and 2016. The board has been accused of liberal marking OR spiking to improve the overall pass percentage.
 
 “The board has brought in several reforms in the evaluating process including the checking of answersheets only by government teachers,” said Rajendra Gupta, public relations officer, RBSE. This year 13 lakh students appeared in the class X RBSE while in class XII the number of students reduced to half by 7 lakh.
