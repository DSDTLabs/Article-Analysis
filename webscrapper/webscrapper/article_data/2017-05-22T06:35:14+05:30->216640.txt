NOIDA: Nearly 200   on Sunday protested outside the office of   in Sector 121 over delayed possession of their flats in Sector 117 of   Extension. The   disrupted the movement of traffic for nearly two hours.

 Highlighting that the project was started in 2009, the protesters claimed that the developer had promised them possession in 2011. “The developer had promised to deliver 2,200 flats in 17 towers in 2011. Till now, they have given possession to nearly 150 buyers only,” said a protester.
 
 Homebuyers who got possession claimed that the developer only gave a provisional possession certificate and not the occupancy certificate. They said they have only temporary electricity connection and they have to rely on water tankers for their daily needs. “Most homebuyers have paid the amount but they have not given possession. Those who got the possession are living a miserable life. We are in a fix and we want a permanent solution,” said Naveen Tyagi, a homebuyer.

 Ramanuj Singh, city magistrate, Noida, said: “We have assured the protesters that we will organise a meeting with developers and also with the electricity department to resolve the issue on Monday.”
