MUMBAI: A Chembur   allegedly beat their 38-year-old neighbour to death when he had asked for the woman’s cellphone number. On Tuesday, the Tilak Nagar police arrested Yashwant (35) and Meena Jhade (32) and booked them for murder, besides other serious charges. 

 The incident took place on Monday at a chawl in Krishna Menon Nagar in Chembur. The police said in the morning, the victim, Rakesh Shinde, went to Jhades’ room in the chawl and asked Meena to give her  . She refused. By afternoon, when Yashwant returned from Pune, where he had gone for some work, Meena complained to him about Shinde. The couple then barged into Shinde’s room, and rained blows on him. “While Yashwant hit Shinde, Meena caught his legs. In the melee, Yashwant’s elbow hit Shinde on the chest and he collapsed. We have sent the body for post-mortem, which will ascertain the cause of death,” said DCP Shahji Umap.
