ROHTAK: Addressing a kisan panchayat at   on Sunday, former chief minister of Haryana   Hooda said that the farmers have been suffering under the   regime in the state. He further stated that the state government and the center have failed to keep their promise.

 “The party came to power on the promise of implementing the Swaminathan committee report that ensures 50% profit to farmers but the BJP has now become ‘Swami’ and the farmer has become ‘Anath’ (orphan),” he said. 
 
 Hooda further said that prices of agricultural commodities have crashed, but the prices of inputs continue to rise.
 
 “They first hit us in the stomach and then shoot in the chest,” Hooda said.
 
 Hooda also took on the Union government for not passing on the benefits of lower internaional crude oil prices to the farmers.
 
 “This could have provided some relief at a time when the farmers were facing acute distress,” he pointed out.
 
 Evoking the farmers of the region, the erstwhile CM said that the farmers are now rising against the anti-farmer policies of the government in the state and the center.
