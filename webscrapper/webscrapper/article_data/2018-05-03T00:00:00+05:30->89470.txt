Ask   about his presence in the upcoming   directorial —  , and he gets extremely emotional. Quite naturally too, for the film’s lead actor — the late   held a special place in his heart.
“The reason why I did this cameo begins and ends with Dhruva Sharma. I would do anything for him, because it is Dhruv. I remember the time he had come home with the intention of asking if I could be part of this film. He was hesitating to ask, and I understood that because of his body language. So instead, I asked him how the film was shaping up and if I could do anything for him in that regard. I would have done whatever he had asked of me,” says Sudeep.
 About the role, Sudeep tells us, “At this point, I don’t know much about the film as I have not seen it yet. I only know what was expected of me. We had shot for three days. I play a doctor who is taken to the forest at gunpoint to treat a patient. So, it is a fairly simple role with no heroism whatsoever. I am glad I did it.”
 The film is releasing at a time when cricket and politics are what’s on people’s mind, and that is a concern, says Sudeep. “It was not time for Dhruva to leave us when he did. He left at a time when he had just about got his foothold in the industry as well as on the cricket field. I miss him terribly. We now have our   cricket tournaments in place and I know how much he would have enjoyed being part of it. He was such a positive and focused boy. His very presence was a source of energy. I used to always keep a little gift as a surprise for him post every match he played and knowing that, he would get even more motivated than he already was to score on the field. He is irreplaceable. I know this film, Kichchu, meant a lot to him and I hope the election and cricket fever doesn’t make the film its victim. A few films have suffered that way. I hope people make it a point to ensure that this film brings all the accolades that Dhruva Sharma truly deserves,” says Sudeep.
