PATNA: The burn ward of the Patna Medical College & Hospital ( ), Bihar’s only facility with a burn ICU, is faced with staff crisis with posts of at least one associate professor, two assistant professor and two senior residents lying vacant.

 There are 56 beds in the general burn ward and six beds in its ICU at PMCH.
 
 According to PMCH’s plastic surgery department head Dr Vidyapati Choudhary, the department has also asked the authorities to sanction at least ten more medical staff for burn patients in the hospital. “We are unable to carry out extensive skin grafting properly because of lack of staff as it is done manually,” he said on Wednesday.
 
 Applauding the state disaster management department’s efforts in creating mass awareness which has led to fewer burn cases, Dr Choudhary pointed out only two incidents of major fire were reported from the city during the last couple of months. “We received only 15 burn cases this year,” he added. 
 
 Sources said the Nalanda Medical College & Hospital also has an eight-bed burn ward, but sans ICU. The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences does not have a burn unit.
 
 The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Patna also offers burn unit facility, but this too cannot handle many cases. “I am the only plastic surgeon in the department,” says Dr Veena Singh, who is also the head of the department of plastic surgery here. 
 
 According to Dr Singh, there are few junior doctors too. “But we need more plastic surgeons to handle extensive burn cases. We have already advertised vacancies for eight specialised doctors,” she said.
 
 Since the AIIMS-Patna does not have either a burn ICU or a blood bank, the sources said, it is ill-equipped to handle extensively burned patients, including acid attack victims. “A proposal for a 30-bed general ward and 10-bed ICU for our burn unit has been approved,” said an AIIMS-P official on Wednesday.
