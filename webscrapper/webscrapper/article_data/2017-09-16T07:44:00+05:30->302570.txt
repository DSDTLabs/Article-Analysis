Amritsar: The three-day, 15th Sikh Federation (UK) National  , began at Guru Nanak Gurdwara in Wolverhampton.

 “The main event on September 17 will hear from both new Sikh MPs elected to the Westminster in June—Preet Kaur Gill, the first Sikh woman MP, and Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP, the first turban-wearing Sikh,” informed Gurjeet Singh of Sikh Federation, in a release issued on Friday.
 
 He stated that other local MPs attending the convention include Pat McFadden and Eleanor Smith. Gurjeet informed that the Sikh convention would not only put the spotlight on what the Sikh Federation (UK) has achieved in the last 12 months, but also the areas of focus for the next 12 months. “There are expected to be some major announcements of wider political interest both nationally and internationally,” he said.
 
 Gurjeet added that the achievements would touch upon the successful election of two Sikhs MPs and progress in the last year on an independent public inquiry into UK involvement in the 1984 Sikh ‘genocide’. “A major announcement is expected regarding the latter throwing down the political gauntlet to Theresa May to come clean on the Thatcher era or face an embarrassing defeat in Parliament with the help of a number of Conservative MPs,” he said.
 
 Earlier this week, around 140 MPs signed an open letter demanding the inclusion of a separate Sikh ethnic tick box in the Census 2021. Those gathered will hear about next steps and plans of how the building blocks were being put in place to allow 100 or more MPs from different political parties to be quickly mobilised to make progress on a number of significant issues of concern to the Sikh community.
 
 He said the Sikh Federation (UK) was set to announce that the global Sikh community in key Commonwealth countries had drawn up plans to force the British PM to make a full apology in parliament before the 100th anniversary of the massacre of Sikhs at the hands of the British in Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919.
