Udhagamandalam: The people of Tamil Nadu are upset with the state government and they are also equally upset with the DMK for allowing the dispensation led by Edappadi K Palaniswami to continue in power, said DMK working president M K Stalin while addressing a party meeting in Ooty on Sunday.

 He also blamed the government for turning a blind eye to the issues of farmers, weavers, government employees and teachers, and women protesting against Tasmac outlets. “The state is in utter turmoil,” Stalin said.
 
 Referring to the contradictory statements by EPS, O Panneerselvam and health secretary J Radhakrishnan in connection with the treatment rendered to the former chief minister, the late J Jayalalithaa, Stalin said, “Certainly, her death is a mystery. Hence, we strongly demand CBI inquiry into it instead of a one-man commission.”
 
 Describing the state health minister, C Vijayabaskar, as ‘Vasool Raja MBBS’, he said, “The statements of Vijayabaskar and OPS were contradictory both before and after the reunion. They are hiding something else and the public has the right to know the truth. Only a CBI probe can bring the truth out.”
 
 The DMK working president also questioned the rationale behind using a private hospital ambulance to shift Jayalalithaa to the hospital when she was under ‘Z’ category protection.
 
 “When we met the Tamil Nadu governor, he told us that he had seen Jayalalithaa at the hospital. But, minister Dindugul Srinivasan had said the other day that no one was allowed to see Jayalaithaa in the hospital,” Stalin added.
 
 Earlier in the day, Stalin had unveiled the statue of C N Annadurai at the DMK office in Ooty.
