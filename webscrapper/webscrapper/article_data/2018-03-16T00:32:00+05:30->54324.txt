Mangaluru: State home minister Ramalinga Reddy called the coastal region of the state “terror factories” of right-wing and Muslim   and had promised to shut it down. Now, in an effort to free Dakshina Kannada district of its tainted tag, the district police have constituted a squad to deal exclusively with communal goons.

 “Our focus will be on communal goondas who have cases against them and are currently active,” B R Ravikanthegowda, district superintendent of police, said.
 
 The anti-communal goonda squad comprises 12 from the police force. It will be headed by an inspector and will include two sub-inspectors. “Their job is to keep an eye on communal goons, their activities, gather background information on them and their sources of livelihood etc.,” Ravikanthegowda said. “The squad will update the information on a daily basis.”
 
 Ravikanthegowda revealed there are 412 goondas in the district. However, only 15% of them are currently active. “There are only 60 active communal goons in the district,” he said, adding all 60 have one or the other case – from a minor CrPc to Goona Act – against them. Most of them use their communal goonda status to extract money from the public, including people from their own faith.
