PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad's son  , who is facing the heat after the CBI filed an 
  , will wait for a sack from Bihar CM Nitish Kumar rather than quit on his own as deputy CM, sources close to the party chief said on Friday. The sources added that this would be followed by 
  from the Bihar government. However, the party would continue to support the Grand Alliance. 

 "The party took the decision on the ongoing row on Wednesday before 
  court in fodder scam cases. Lalu, along with his selected aides and senior members, decided to wait for Nitish to sack Tejashwi," an RJD functionary said preferring anonymity. He added that Tejashwi's resignation would demoralise the party cadres as that could lead to a perception that RJD's first family was in the wrong.
 
 "As per our gameplan, following Tejashwi's exit, our other 11 ministers will resign but the RJD will support the government from outside to keep the Mahagathbandhan intact," he said and added that the move would earn sympathy for   among the voters and save the party from the blame of 
  in the state. Lalu keeps saying he will protect the Mahagathbandhan in Bihar at any cost to fight the BJP and RSS as break-up with Nitish will severely damage the prospects of a grand alliance of all opposition parties at the national level for 2019 general elections.
 
 Meanwhile, Congress president Sonia Gandhi is in touch with both Lalu and Nitish to convince them not to take any step which could adversely affect the ruling alliance in Bihar. "Sonia ji called Lalu and Nitish on Wednesday as well as on Friday and discussed the political scenario in Bihar. Congress knows well that the Grand Alliance break-up in Bihar will be a jolt to the move to form an anti-BJP front at the Centre," the RJD functionary said.
