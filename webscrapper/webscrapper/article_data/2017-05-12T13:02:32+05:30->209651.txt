PATNA: Patna district magistrate (DM)   discussed several important issues — from safety norms and   system to   and proper canteens — with principals and members of different   at a meeting on Thursday. Over 100 school representatives were present at the meet and raised different queries.

 The district administration’s move came close on the heels of the kidnapping of 12-year-old Harsh Raj of Radiant International School from outside his school campus on Tuesday. The class VIII student was rescued by police within a couple of hours.
 
 The DM asked the school principals to prepare a parking plan and hand it over to the city traffic police during the summer vacations. “Schools will not block the road by parking vehicles outside their campuses. Parking lots will be created on the campus for buses and vans,” he said and suggested schools to make use of old books by donating them to students of government schools or libraries.
 
 Agarwal highlighted the need to do away with unhealthy fast food stalls and tobacco shops near school gates. He also directed the principals to install CCTV cameras, recruit guards to regulate traffic near schools, update school websites, implement online fee payment system, introduce SMS alert system and GPS in buses and begin hobby classes during summer vacations.
 
 SSP Manu Maharaj, who also attended the meet, said, “Schools should adopt biometric attendance system and hand over a list of bus drivers and conductors along with their contact details to the Patna police.”
 
 Criticizing schools for not following the CBSE’s guidelines on school bags, the Board’s regional officer (Bihar and Jharkhand) Lakhan Lal Meena said, “Schools should plan timetables in such a way that students carry lesser number of books and notebooks daily. However, these norms are openly being flouted and we will soon take strict action against the violators. 
 
 SP (Traffic) Prantosh Kumar Das was also present at the meeting.
