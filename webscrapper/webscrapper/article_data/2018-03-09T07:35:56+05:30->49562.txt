NEW DELHI: India’s cramped airport infrastructure has begun putting massive pressure on personnel entrusted with the task of safely handling the growing volume of flights.

The charter plane landed safely on the second attempt. An   spokesman said the incident has been reported to the  .
 
 Aviation officials say airport infrastructure has not kept pace with the growth of air traffic in India. “With the same number of runways and other infrastructure, we are handling a much higher volume of traffic. Our personnel are under tremendous pressure,” said an airport official.
