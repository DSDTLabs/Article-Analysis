VADODARA/ANAND:  , who is accused of   in  , surrendered to the police on Tuesday, a day after his anticipatory bail plea was turned down by a local court. 

 Patel, however, was released on bail on Tuesday itself as the court rejected Vidyanagar police’s remand application. 
 
 Patel had allegedly knocked down Zen School commerce student Maitri Talali on December 21 when she was returning home on her two-wheeler with her 13-year-old brother Dev riding pillion near Zydus Hospital in Anand. 
 
 Maitri’s father – Rupesh Talati - had registered a complaint at Vidyanagar police against Patel alleging that he was recklessly driving his sports bike which led to Maitri’s death on the spot. Dev had suffered serious injuries and was discharged only recently. 
 
 Rupesh, an insurance agent, had also approached various authorities seeking justice and alleging that the investigating officer had botched up the probe in the case. 
 
 In a memorandum to Anand district superintendent of police (SP) Makrand Chauhan, Rupesh had stated that the police had not even bothered to check CCTV footage of the road where the accused was racing for fun with a girl riding as pillion. The girl’s family has been alleging that the bike that the accused was riding did not even have a RTO registration but the cops have not taken into consideration any of this aspect during their probe so far. 
 
 Anand SP has assured her father of a thorough probe.
