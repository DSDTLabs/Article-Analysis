AHMEDABAD:   (HC) has pulled up the state authorities for invoking   (PASA) against an accused in the   scam, and temporarily stayed his detention. Along with few others, Thomas Patel, who was nabbed by the cyber cell of the city crime branch in December 2016, was ordered to be detained under   by the city police commissioner. He has been booked for violation of Information Technology Act for the IRS scam in the USA.

 When Patel questioned the PASA order, Justice S H Vora questioned how the state government could justify disruption of public order when a person was booked for violation of IT Act. The HC admitted Patelâ€™s petition on Thursday and sought explanation from the state government and the city police commissioner by April 18. The court ordered the authorities not to detain Patel under PASA at least in connection with two FIRs lodged with the Satellite police, in which only section of IT Act has been applied against him. 
 
 Patel has been accused of working in partnership with co-accused Sandeep Rajvani and   in Lac Art El Infotech Pvt Ltd at Bodakdev. He is believed to be responsible for transferring funds extorted from the US citizens.
