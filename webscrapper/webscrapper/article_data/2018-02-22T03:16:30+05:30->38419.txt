THANE: Residents from the lake city have started feeling the heat as the cool winter winds have retreated, leaving Thaneites with the first warm and humid winds.

 The minimum   in the city has been hovering around 17 to 18 degrees Celsius since a week. It has now risen to around 20 to 21 degrees Celsius. 
 
 Similarly, the maximum temperature in the city has risen by over 20% from 31 degrees Celsius last week to over 37.6 degrees Celsius this week. “The weather has changed drastically. Till the beginning of February, it was quite pleasant. But since the last few days, it has turned hot and humid. In the afternoons it is extremely hot. When I checked the weather app to know the temperature, it showed me above 35 degrees Celsius. If this is the scenario now then by May it will just get worse,” said   (33), a   resident.
 
 
  
 Weathermen have said that the constant rise in temperature is an indication of the onset of summer. They have also said that residents are not going to get any respite from the heat till the pre-monsoon showers in June-July.
 
 Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at  , said, “The mercury levels across the nation is on the rise. While the average temperatures in the northern regions like Delhi has touched 29 degrees Celsius, those in the western regions like Mumbai and Thane are hovering between 34 and 35 degrees Celsius. These temperatures will slowly rise over the next few days and remain stable thereafter as the weather systems over central India will not allow the cool winds to spread to the south and south west regions.”
 
 “As there was a short winter this year, the summer will be relatively longer and hotter. But we will be able to gauge the intensity of the scorching heat and any possibility of heat waves only by the second week of March as we look for signs of pre-monsoon showers in the north east. We need to be prepared to brave a scorching summer,” he said.
