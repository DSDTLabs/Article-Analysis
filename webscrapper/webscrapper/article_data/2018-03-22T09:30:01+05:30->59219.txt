SECUNDERABAD: Railway passengers travelling from three terminals in the city even at odd hours are likely to waste less time waiting for app-based cab services.

 As seen at the new metro stations, cab aggregator Ola will also provide last mile connectivity service at  , Hyderabad and Kacheguda stations through a three-year long partnership with South Central Railway (SCR). The reason behind introducing the services at the three stations is that daily footfall of commuters here is more than the rest of the stations in Telangana.
 
 Ola kiosks have come up in the station premises with separate parking bays and pick up points. Sources told TOI,that the cab aggregator’s market research showed that in the initial days of setting up the kiosks, they registered the maximum bookings for Ola micro category for five consecutive hours from 5am to 10am.
 
 The cab service provider said expected arrival time will be reduced to two minutes as part of their partnership with SCR.
 
 Amit Vardhan, divisional railway manager, Secunderabad said, “Footfall of passengers at the three stations is over two lakh. We have partnered with Ola to resolve last mile connectivity issues of commuters.”
 
 Sandeep Upadhyay, head of Ola in the city, said, “The specific zones and kiosks for our service will assist passengers to book their cabs or autos without much hassle. We are planning to introduce the same at other railway stations in the next few months,” said.
