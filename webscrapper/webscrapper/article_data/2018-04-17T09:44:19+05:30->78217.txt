AMETHI: The   administration on Monday stopped the   president   from inaugurating a link road connecting Thauri village to Kotwa village on Monday. The foundation stone of the 5.5km long road in Amethi had been laid by   Gandhi. 

  The action came after BJP district president Uma Shankar Pandey objected to the proposed inauguration by the Congress chief. In his plea to the Amethi administration, Pandey urged them to stop the ceremony because the Congress MP was trying to inaugurate an incomplete project. 
 
 "The road was constructed under  , which means that it was not funded by Rahul Gandhi. The Congress and Rahul are trying to take credit for it," Pandey told reporters. 
 
 SDM Amethi Abhay Pandey confirmed to TOI that the Congress workers were asked to cancel the inauguration as the project was incomplete. Sources in Congress's Amethi unit blamed party general secretary   for the cancellation. 
 
  Congress district president Yogendra Mishra said it was not an inauguration programme and Rahul was just going to the spot to take stock of the situation.
 
 Meanwhile, Rahul targeted   minister  , who frequently visits Amethi. "Many people from Delhi are coming these days to Amethi to take credit for the good work done by us. But our commitment to Amethi is above politics. We will always work for the development of Amethi whether Congress is in power or not."
