JAIPUR:   Malhotra, a grade 11 student of Jayshree Periwal International School has created PLUTO, a simple and effective device for farmers to operate motor pumps installed in their fields via a mobile phone or a landline without a 3G/4G network. It can be controlled from anywhere.

 “Even when farmers are busy elsewhere and not present at their homes, Pluto can be easily operated by their housewives. Thus, Pluto leads to women’s empowerment. Also, it can run easily by kids and old people. During the rainy season, using some of the electrical devices is unsafe as they may put the users at risk of getting electrocuted. But with Pluto, there is so such danger. It is completely safe and even children can use it without any risk of electrocution,” said Ishan.
 
 He informed that apart from water pumps, electrical equipment such as refrigerators, washing machines and many others can also be turned on and off by using Pluto. Dr. Harsh Vardhan, minister of science & technology and earth sciences, government of India, has called his work ‘innovative.’
