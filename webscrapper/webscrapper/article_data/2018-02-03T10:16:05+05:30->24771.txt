BHOPAL: Dr Ashok Maske, a member of Peoples' Medical College admission committee and an accused in PMT-2012 scam, surrendered in the special court of D P Mishra on Friday. The court remanded him to jail under judicial custody.

 After the surrender of chairman of   Dr Ajay Goenka in connection with the same case on Wednesday, other proprietors of the private medical colleges made accused in PMT-2012 scam were supposed to follow suit, going by the fact that their application for anticipatory bail has been rejected even by the highest court of the country but it has not happened till now.
 
 Chairman, Peoples' Medical College, Suresh Vijayvergiya, director of the college, Capt Ambreesh Sharma, chairman, Index Medical College, Suresh Singh Bhadoriya and chairman of   N Choukse are among accused in the case, wanted by law and absconding.
 
 While they are leaving no stone unturned to get anticipatory bail, the prosecuting agency CBI seems to be giving them a long rope, allowing them to exhaust all their options and then surrender in the court. The surrender of Dr Goenka, who was among the most influential members of the Association of Private Dental & Medical Colleges, which conducted DMAT test parallel to PMT for admission in private medical colleges, raised hopes that other high-profile accused in the case may also surrender soon but a couple of days later, it is only doctors, made accused in the case because of their signature in the admission list as member of the college admission committee, who are coming forward to surrender.
