GUWAHATI: The Kamrup (Metro) administration will take legal action against those found responsible for the recent death of 22   at  , located 15 km away from the city. 

 Though a report on the cause of death of the highly endangered birds is yet to be brought out, officials said the ongoing investigation had hinted at poisoning.
 
 The greater adjutant stork is listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. "We are going to take legal action against anyone found involved in the criminal act of killing the birds," deputy commissioner M Angamuthu said on Thursday.
 
 The   (NGT) on Tuesday took note of the incident and directed the state government to file an affidavit within three weeks. The NGT was hearing a case filed by environment activist Rohit Choudhury against the   (GMC)'s garbage dump near the Beel.
 
 "The applicant has drawn our attention to an alarming incident in which at least 20 greater adjutant storks were found dead at a spot close to the GMC's garbage dump. Primary investigation has revealed that the storks might have fed on poisonous substances in the garbage," the NGT said.
 
 Senior additional advocate general Devajit Saikia submitted to the NGT that steps had been taken to prevent such incidents and an investigation was on to find out the cause of death. 
 
 The district administration, forest and veterinary departments, police, Pollution Control Board, Guwahati Municipal Corporation and other stakeholders have formed a team to find the cause of the birds' death. The preliminary autopsy report, however, revealed that the stomach of the birds was empty at the time of death. 
 
 The Northeastern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory here is trying to find out if there were traces of toxic substances in the birds' muscles or if they died of viral/bacterial infections.
