MUMBAI:   Tehmtan Andhyarujina passed away on Tuesday. He was 83. He practised law for six decades and has left behind a legacy in judgments he helped shape with his submissions as counsel, on constitutional law.

 Among the many landmark cases he contributed his erudite mind and legal skills to include the seminal   in which the   laid down the ‘basic structure doctrine’ and while limiting the power of Parliament on amending the Constitution, strengthened the power of judicial review.
 
 After the funeral at the Parsi Doongerwadi, jurist Iqbal Chagla said, “It is a very sad day today when we lost another giant in the profession. Just a few days ago, we lost Anil Diwan. Andhyarujina was one of the most respected lawyers, came from a great chamber and went on to achieve great heights as AG and then solicitor general, we feel a great sense of loss.”
 
 Andhyarujina was also the state advocate general from 1993 to 1995, before he became the solicitor general in 1996-1998. Graduating in law in 1957 from the Government Law College, he chose to join the legal profession despite qualifying for the Indian Foreign Service in 1958. He had joined the chambers of the legendary jurist and constitutional expert H M Seervai.
 
 Few know that as solicitor general, his valuable assistance paved the way for the landmark guidelines laid down by the SC in 1997 in the Vishakha case to protect women from sexual harassment at the workplace. 
 
 It was Andhyarujina whose erudition the SC sought when it made him amicus curiae (friend of the court) in the defining   in 2011. He worked with the same quiet dedication, bringing his expertise and depth of knowledge into analysis and interpretation of law to assist the apex judiciary, till the very end.
