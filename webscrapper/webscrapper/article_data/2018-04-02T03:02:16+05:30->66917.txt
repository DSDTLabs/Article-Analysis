Focused on a well-travelled woman, who speaks her mind and knows what she wants, Falguni and Shane Peacock’s latest bridal collection consisted of muted and pastel colours. The show saw Vartika Singh (Miss Grand International 2015 Second Runner-Up) and   (Mr World 2016) opening the show. While Vartika was dressed in a stunning all-golden lehenga choli, Rohit was sporting a sherwani in beige with silver embroidery work. 

  
  The collection had everything one would need for a wedding – right from a lehenga choli to a cocktail gown – for everyone from the family. The designs were especially crafted for Gen Next and that’s what made the showstoppers, actors   and  , who will soon be seen as siblings in ' Beyond The Clouds', an ideal choice. 
 
 The millennials, both of whom made their debut on the ramp, were seen in white outfits. While Ishaan was wearing a sherwani with thread work, Malavika was seen in a lehenga choli with the designer’s signature feather work on the choli’s shoulder. “We couldn’t have asked for anyone better than them as our showstoppers,” said the designer duo in unison. 
 
 
  
 
 Talking about walking the ramp for the first time, Malavika said, “It feels amazing because I admire Falguni and Shane’s work. They come up with amazing deseigns. Walking for BT and that too the finale… I couldn’t have asked for more.” Added Ishaan, “I’m excited to be here and represent these great designers.”
