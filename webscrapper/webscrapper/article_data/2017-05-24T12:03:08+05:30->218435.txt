This year, Deepika Padukone is rising like a true fashion queen. From her movie promotions in the past to her Cannes debut, she’s giving us back-to-back stylish appearances. She even stuns us with her airport looks again and again. From sporty track pants to sneakers, all her airport style is top notch. 

 
 Looking at the recent airport spotting, we can't deny that it's one of her most glamourous airport styles. She was snapped at the Mumbai airport, post her Cannes debut. She was seen wearing a pair of black jeans, white tank top with a statement tassel jacket. The fun fringe jacket by Tim Ryan showcased was a mix of bright colours, while the tiered fringe all over with long sleeves, made everyone’s head turn.
 
 
  
 Fringes have been one of the biggest trends of the season. Whether it’s on a bag, dress or a jacket, a little flyaway fringe always adds drama. And this super-cool fringe jacket is one thing you should invest in this season, just like our style star, DP.
