NEW DELHI: A ground collision was averted at   airport on Wednesday morning when a Visakhapatnam-bound IndiGo flight, taxiing in low visibility, mistakenly entered a taxiway where a   flight was already stationed before it was halted by an air traffic controller. 

 While the IndiGo aircraft was towed back, the whole operation took more than an hour by when a number of   had to be diverted and over 25 delayed. ATC also held back 10 flights at the holding point till the main runway was made operational again.
 
 The two pilots of the IndiGo aircraft were promptly derostered—taken off duty—and would not be given any flying assignment until   and the airline inquire into the incident, an IndiGo spokesperson said.
 
 The incident took place around 5.45am on the main runway when IndiGo’s flight 6E-719 sought permission to take off, moving from Taxiway C for runway 28. However, due to low visibility, the flight missed the main runway and ended up on Taxiway W where a Jet Airways aircraft was stationed, the spokesperson said.
 
 The main runway was closed for operation due to this runway incursion and flights resumed there only at 6.55am.
 
 The IndiGo spokesperson said their aircraft had adequate separation from the Jet Airways plane and that the safety of the passengers was not compromised. “ATC advised flight 6E-719 to stop and it halted with an adequate separation from the Jet Airways plane. The safety of passengers, crew and aircraft was not compromised at any time… The matter is being investigated by IndiGo’s safety department and DGCA.”
 
 This is the second incident at IGI airport where   on ground came perilously close; IndiGo and SpiceJet aircraft came face to face on the same taxiway during low-visibility conditions on December 27.
