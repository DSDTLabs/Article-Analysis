KOLHAPUR:   in the city on Wednesday shut the vegetable market on the   ( ) premises. 

 They were demanding abolition of the 6% commission that agents levied on them while purchasing agricultural produce and also against the delay in the opening of the market everyday.
 
 The agents effectively function as middlemen between farmers and traders. Earlier, farmers had to pay 6% commission to these agents. In July 2016, the state issued an order ending the system of charging commission from farmers and said the commission would now be paid by traders.
 
 The protests led to delay in opening the retail market and delivery of produce, resulting in financial losses to the tune of Rs 20 lakh. 
 
 Rajendra Laykar, a retail trader and president of Runmukteshwar vegetables market, said, “The Kolhapur market offers good rates to farmers’ produce compared to other markets. Farmers therefore bring their produce to Kolhapur. They don’t have any problem in paying commission. Still the agents charge commission from us. This should be end.”
 
 Laykar added, “Also, the agents open the market late to earn more profit. Therefore, we lose bargaining power and are compelled to buy vegetables at higher rates. The government should provide separate space for farmers to sell their produce.”
 
 The market committee officials, however, said that removal of commission did not come under their jurisdiction. APMC chairman   said, “Traders can’t stop auctions of agricultural produce on the committee premises. If they do not agree with the market conditions, they are free to buy from places other than the committee. Nobody can prevent any individual trader from participating in market activities.”
