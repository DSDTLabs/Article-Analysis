CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami termed the reduction in allocated share of Cauvery water ‘disappointing’ but added that the order had ‘several aspects positive to the state’.

 “The verdict orders the Centre to frame a scheme within six weeks to smoothly implement the order of the Tribunal, which is a massive victory for the state government,” Palaniswami said. “It reiterates that an inter-state river water is a national asset and no single state can claim exclusive ownership, and that is commendable.”
 
 Palaniswami said the determination of 24.708 lakh acres of irrigated area arrived at by the Tribunal for Tamil Nadu has been recognised. “Also, the allotment of 10tmcft of water for environmental protection in Tamil Nadu has been accepted. The monthly release as per the final award of the Tribunal has been ensured for 15 years,” he said.
 
 Blaming the DMK for not ensuring that Tamil Nadu got its due share, Palaniswami said, “DMK working president M K Stalin and principal secretary S Duraimurugan try to create an image that the state lost its rights due the verdict. But it is the DMK that gave up state’s rights and acted against the state’s welfare.”
 
 The chief minister slammed the DMK for not reviewing the 1924 agreement in 1974 when Karnataka built Kabini dam “Had certain aspects of the 1924 agreement been reviewed in 1974, this situation would not have arisen. It is clear that only during DMK regime, TN lost its rights,” he said.
