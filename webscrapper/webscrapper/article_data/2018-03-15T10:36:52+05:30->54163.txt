MEERUT: Amid celebrations of winning the   and Phulpur by-elections on Wednesday, a scuffle broke out among the members of   at their office in Meerut. The fight, which was caught on camera, showed party members who were earlier dancing away to the beats of drums thrashing each other, so much so that one of the party members’ clothes also got torn.
 
  The video showed party members in red SP caps dancing away to the beats of drums. Shortly afterwards, two members started thrashing and abusing each other. The video, which was quickly circulated on social media, further showed the members asking the camera person to switch off the camera and not record the act.
  
  In a huge blow to the ruling BJP, SP not only won the   seat which was earlier with UP deputy CM   but also won in Gorakhpur, which is the bastion of UP CM Yogi Adityanath. The results proved a success for the SP-BSP experiment, which could pave the way for the two parties in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
  
  Meawhile, even as the video of the party members fighting among themselves circulated on social media, SP Meerut district president   denied any such incident had occurred at the party office. “We had called the drummers and even distributed 25 kg of sweets among the people, but no fight occurred when I was there. If something of that sort happened later, it will be checked and action taken against the party members concerned.”
