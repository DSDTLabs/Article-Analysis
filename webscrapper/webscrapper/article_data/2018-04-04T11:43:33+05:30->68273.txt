JAIPUR: The rise in   price has reduced the consumption of   and diesel by 4%-5% in the state.   Patrol Dealers Association (RPDA) has shared that in the last two weeks, the consumption of fuel has gone down due to rise in prices.

 State consumes around 6 lakh litre of fuel every day. “The fall in consumption is based on our minute observation of last two weeks. The observation is made on the basis of feedback from members. The consumption will further decline if the price of fuel continues to rise,” said  , president of RPDA.
 
 He shared that two categories of consumers have reduced the consumption: salaried employees and students. “Our feedback says that salaried employees have curtailed the trips they make. The worst-affected are students who have very limited means to spend on fuel,” said Suneet.
 
 The price hike has also made the petrol owners jittery. The tax component on fuel in Rajasthan is higher than the Delhi and   has made the situation further worst for the petrol dealers.
 
 “The truckers usually fill the tanks in   to cover maximum of their journey in Rajasthan so to fill the fuel in Gujarat. The further rise will encourage them to skip Rajasthan completely,” said a petrol pump owner. “The volatility has forced us to suspend all hiring from the past 2-3 months. If the consumption continues to fall we may have to curtail on the facilities,” said a petrol pump owner based in the city. Experts said that the price is not likely to reverse in the near future as the price of crude oil in the international market is rising since the mid of 2016.
