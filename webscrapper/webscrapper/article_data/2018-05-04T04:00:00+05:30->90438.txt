Surat: Five doctors at the New Civil Hospital (NCH) are likely to face action for alleged negligence that resulted in death of a 35-year-old accident victim during early hours of Tuesday. Accident victim Gokul Rajbahadur Yadav was brought to NCH in critical condition on Tuesday. After treatment at trauma centre as his condition became stable, he was sent for treatment in another ward, where he was kept waiting for six hours. Meanwhile, he died due to non-availability of treatment. NCH and the Government Medical College (GMC) formed a committee to inquire the case and submitted its report to the health department on Wednesday. Based on the report, show-cause notices will be issued to the senior doctors, neurosurgeon Mehul Modi and Gaurang Chanchpara of the orthopaedic department.  NCH officials said the senior doctors will be asked to explain where they were when Yadav was kept waiting for admission and why no action should be taken against them.  Sources at NCH further informed that senior doctors were not present on duty and were not available when contacted over the phone. The junior doctors likely to face suspension include Jitendra Singh of the orthopaedic department, Deval Parikh and Varun Joshi, both from the surgery department. They are accused of not admitting the patient in due time. “The decision to issue show-cause notice to senior doctors and to suspend the junior doctors has been taken by the health department. The order will be issued once the formalities are completed,” minister of state for health Kishore Kanani said.
