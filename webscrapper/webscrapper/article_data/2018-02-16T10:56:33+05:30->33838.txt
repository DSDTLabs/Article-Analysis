BENGALURU: The cash-starved   ( ) hopes the proposed 11-km Major Arterial Road (MAR), linking   and   and scything through Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout, will boost shrinking demand for sites in the layout. 

 In the first phase, 5,000 sites were allotted in the west Bengaluru layout, which envisaged acquisition of 4,043 acres of land in Bengaluru north and south taluks and formation of 40,000 sites in all its nine blocks. The Rs 352-crore road project is likely to encourage vertical growth on either side. Besides, the Metro connectivity planned till Challaghatta will also create demand for as many as 40,000 sites in the Layout, said BDA officials. 
 
 “The MAR is strategically located and will provide much-needed connectivity and accessibility from Magadi Road and Mysuru Road. It also cuts through the proposed   depot at Challaghatta village through four tunnels,” said officials. 
 
 Asked about plans to switch from seniority to lottery system while allotting sites, the officials said no such decision has been taken. 
 
 “With MAR, land value in the layout will escalate in the next two years. Currently, the BDA is selling sites for Rs 2,000 per sq ft. Private layouts in the vicinity are going at Rs 2,800-3,000 per sq ft. Once water, electricity and road network is provided for the entire layout, price will escalate,” said an official.
