If you lose a certificate provided by the   government, then the government staffers will no longer have to complete the formalities once again for reissuing it. 

 The certificate issued to you will be saved in a digital locker and reissued to you immediately.
 
 The state government has also taken several steps to simplify the process to issue certificates for caste, income, domicile, nationality, OBC non-creamy layer etc said Swadhin Kshatriya, chief right to services commissioner of the state. He said the commission would take strict action against government staffers who fail to issue documents within the stipulated time frame.
 
 Addressing a press conference on Friday, Kshatriya said, “We have simplified the process and now it needs to move through only three tables. Deliberations are on to make the process even simpler,” he added.
 
 Nagpur district   is issuing 7/12 land extract online. 
 
 More than 400 services have been included under the Right to Services Act. However, only a few departments like revenue, urban development, rural development, etc. are following the Act, said Kshatriya. “We will carry out an awareness drive at the gram panchayat level to ensure that all departments follow the Act. I have directed all district collectors to hold workshops on the Act,” he said.
 
 When pointed out that even if a man has a caste certificate, his son or daughter also needs to procure their caste certificates, the commissioner said that the law needs to be changed for this.
