CHARMINAR: The time cap for Muslim weddings has sparked a debate in the Muslim community and also on social media.

 Many Muslims took to Facebook and WhatsApp to express their perception on this issue. While some see the move as impossible to impose, others see it as an encroachment in people’s way of celebrating and expressing happiness.
 
 A social reformist, Mohammed Ilyas Shamshi ,said the decision was right but the Telangana State   Board Chairman   should first focus on protection of Wakf properties .
 
 “The decision is welcomed but we oppose the place where the meeting was conducted. TWSB Chairman Mohammed Saleem should pay attention towards his duties first as many Wakf properties were being looted and many have been encroached. Though, Mohammed Saleem has come up with Fatwa against late night marriages, but why not bring Fatwa against Wakf land encroachers?,” said Mohammed Ilyas Shamshi.
 
 Misbha Adnan, a social activist, said that the board chairman should only work on reclaiming Wakf properties instead of interfering in marriages.
 
 “Marriage is a happy occasion for every family, imposing such instructions to wrap up functions prior to 12am is not in good taste. In the course of rainy days, people will face difficulty to reach the destination on time,’’ Misba Adnan told TOI.
 
 He further added that, “VIP guests such as MPs, MLAs and other dignitaries attending certain events will obviously get late. And many times due to their movement, traffic goes out of gear in front of certain function halls in the city.’’   wrote “it was an encroachment as timings cannot be fixed as per TSWB chairman or friendly policemen’s wishes.”
