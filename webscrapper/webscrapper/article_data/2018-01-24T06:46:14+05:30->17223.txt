HYDERABAD: The   on Tuesday asked Telangana and AP to start prosecuting teachers who allow copying in examinations. The Bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice M   was hearing a public interest petition filed by professor  , who expressed apprehension at the lack of vision among education policy makers. 

  S   told the court that if the states had the will to conduct examinations flawlessly in 1,450 exam halls across the state, it is not a difficult task. He cited the example of state excise wings that monitor lakhs of liquor shops and ensure earnings in crores come into the state exchequers. "But in matters of education, short-sighted authorities are not showing any interest," he said. 
 
 "When Hyderabad police can keep track of law and order through 20,000 CCTV cameras in the city alone, why can't education authorities monitor a few hundred exam halls with the same CCTV mechanism?" said Reddy. 
 
 Highlighting the Gujarat model of education and exams, the senior counsel urged the court to direct the states to bring in far-reaching changes in the way exams are held to put an end to the practice that is destroying the education system. "There should be a will power to stop producing Munna Bhais any more from T and AP," he said.
