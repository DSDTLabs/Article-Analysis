BATHINDA:Stopped from creating a nuisance while playing Holi, 10 youths attacked a newlywed man in Jaitu town of Faridkot district on Friday, following which the victim succumbed to his injuries a few hours later. 

 Police have registered a case of murder against four residents of the town and six others who are yet to be identified. Angry over police not making any arrests in the case, residents of the town protested on the   road on Saturday. Rakesh Kumar, 22, was a taxi driver and got married five months ago.
 
 Rakesh’s brother  , in the police complaint, has alleged that the youths were on their motorcycles and creating a scene at Pirkhana locality of Jaito while playing Holi. Rakesh objected to it and asked the youths, who were allegedly inebriated, not to make a noise near his home.
 
 The boys left, but returned after some time with blunt weapons and attacked Rakesh with a baseball bat and an iron rod. Rakesh’s family took him to Jaito civil hospital and then to Guru   Medical College, Faridkot, where he succumbed to injuries. “Rakesh passed away at the hospital. We want strict action against the guilty and will not cremate the body till arrests are made in the case,” Bittu, also a taxi driver, said, 
 
 Faridkot senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nanak Singh said four of the accused had been identified as Radhe, Naval Kishor, Ashwani Kumar and Sahil. “We are trying to track down the accused,” he said.
