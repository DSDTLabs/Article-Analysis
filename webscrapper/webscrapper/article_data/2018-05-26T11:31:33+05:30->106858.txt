HYDERABAD: The TRS is preparing for the ensuing gram panchayat (GP) polls, which are considered a 'pre-final' test in rural areas for all political parties in   ahead of the   and Lok Sabha elections 2018-19. 

 This time panchayat polls have assumed greater significance after the entry of  's new political party, Telangana Jana Samithi. The polls are expected to establish where every political party stands among the rural electorate. 
 
 Under the banner of Telangana Joint Action Committee (TJAC), Kodandaram and   had led the Telangana statehood agitation. Four years later, Kodandaram has launched the new political party (TJS) and announced that they will contest gram panchayat and Assembly polls.
 
 Though Gram Panchayat elections are fought on non-political party basis, on independent symbols, it is an open secret that parties leave no stone unturned to ensure that the candidates supported by them win. 
 
 Though the TRS leaders did not confirm, sources said the KCR-government which is wary of the TJS, reportedly conducted a survey via the intelligence wing about the "presence, strength and winning aspects of Kodandaram's TJS" in gram panchayats. 
 
 These elections have come as a boon to TJS by giving it the much needed platform to expand the party base in every village.
 
  Panchayat raj and rural development minister Jupally Krishna Rao directed officials to ensure all arrangements are made in coordination with the State Election Commission.
 
 While the main opposition   party followed by the BJP and other parties have started to strengthen the booth level election management strategies, TRS which almost completed the exercise has the risk of facing "rebel problem" as there are more than two candidates for the seat of sarpanch and also wards in a majority gram panchayats for the TRS. 
 
 Prof Kodandaram said they are receiving a great response to their call for candidates to apply to TJS for contesting gram panchayat elections.
