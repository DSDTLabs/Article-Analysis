The trailer of  's  , which will be distributed by  , and produced by Rough Note, has created a buzz. It brings together an unusual combination of actors -Rajakumaran and  , on screen.   says, “Milton came to me with this script saying that there is a particular role in which he wanted me to act. Initially, I was very sceptical and told him that it will be risky if I take up this one. I said so, as I didn't want him to feel bad after the shoot.But he was very particular that I do this role. So, eventually I agreed to do the film. I play a guy , who puts puli vesham, a traditional game that is going extinct. He doesn't get enough work, and later works with a police officer as a cook and moves to another town. It is there that his life changes. I had to go through several changes -both physically and mentally for the film.“ And for Bharath, who plays a town boxer, things were different.“Unlike his character, my role Nambi comes from an affluent family . He is the richest guy in his town and he is a boxer.Instead of going for a lean physique, I went in for a beefedup look since that's how town boxers look like. I put on weight, and trained in boxing for a month,“ says Bharath, adding, “Sometimes, for us, doing these stereotypical roles might get to us. It was around that time when I got this one. I am really happy that Milton gave me this challenging role.This will be a realistic, commercial film.“

 Both seem to have had a great experience working with the director. “Though I knew him before, I went in as an actor, and gave him what he wanted me for his film. He's a passionate filmmaker,“ says Rajakumaran. Bharath couldn't agree more, “He directed me in one of my earlier films, and it was after a long gap that I got to work with him again. He's still the same person, whom I met years ago. He is focused, yet chilled out to work with.“
