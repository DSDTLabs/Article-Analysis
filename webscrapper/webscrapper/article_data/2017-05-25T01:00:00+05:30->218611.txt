 “Simbu is someone who speaks his heart and doesn’t mince words. Since Simbu has worked on the songs for two months, we showed him the footage that we had shot in Georgia. The songs were choreographed by Sathish and he was pleasantly surprised seeing Santhanam’s graceful dance moves. He appreciated Santhanam saying he had beautifully danced to his songs,” says Ganesh.
 
 The unit has canned the song, Unnakkaga, sung by composer Leon James. Another song Siru Siru Pozhuthil, marks the singing debut of singer Unnikrishnan’s 16-year-old son Vasudev Krishnan and Keerthana, another newbie. “Simbu was particular that Vasudev should sing this song. In fact, when the boy initially recorded, it did not sound that good, and I even suggested that we could go with a different singer. But Simbu was confident and told him to practise the song and come to the recording a week later. When he recorded the song after a week, we were all satisfied with it,” says Ganesh.
