PATNA: Furious over pending payment of post-retirement benefits to hundreds of employees of JP University and other universities for the last several years, the Patna   has summoned their vice-chancellors (VC) and registrars on February 12.

 While hearing a batch of petitions filed by retired university employees on Friday, Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah also ordered the principal secretary of chancellor and those of finance and education departments to remain present before the bench on the next of hearing.
 
 The VCs and registrars of Patna University, Magadh University, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University, Tilka Manjhi University, JP University, LN Mithila University, Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University, BN Mandal University, Bihar Agriculture University and Veer Kunwar Singh University have been asked to appear before the court.
 
 The court is hearing around 107 more petitions apart from the four main petitions related to non-payment of retirement benefits to university employees.
 
 Advocate Anjani Kumar, who appeared for JP University, said more than 100 employees of the university were waiting to get their retirement benefits and the university required several crores of rupees for that. “The finance department had been communicated on several occasion to release funds for the same,” he said, adding the situation was same with other universities in Bihar.
