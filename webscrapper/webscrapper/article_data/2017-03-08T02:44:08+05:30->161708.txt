MUMBAI:   seized 12 gold bars weighing 100gm each worth Rs 36.45 lakh from an architectural supervisor who arrived from Singapore on Monday night. Officials said the accused,  , had stuck the gold bars to his soles using adhesive tapes and wore thick socks over them to avoid detection. 

 Palaniyandy, who draws a monthly salary of Rs 1.5 lakh, confessed that he became a carrier to make extra money. He was booked for smuggling and later released on bail after his statement was recorded.
 
 Last week, a Customs official had noticed Palaniyandy moving around ‘suspiciously’ after arriving from Singapore. The same officer spotted him again at the airport on Monday and intercepted him on suspicion and searched his baggage. When the officials didn’t find anything in his bags, they asked him to walk through the metal detector, which went off. On frisking him, the Customs officials found six gold bars stuck to each of his soles. He said that a man called Muru in Singapore had asked him to hand over the gold to a contact in Mumbai.
