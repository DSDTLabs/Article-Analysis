PANAJI: Stating that the BJP was out to divide the country along communal lines, the   unit has decided to organise a symbolic fast on April 9 to promote harmony among various sections of the society. Congressmen will gather at   between 11am and 5pm to condemn the recent “objectionable statements” made by BJP leaders.

 The decision to go on a daylong fast is in response to   president Rahul Gandhi’s plan to hold a fast to help promote peace, brotherhood and harmony in the country. State Congress president   held a joint meeting of the   committee and the Congress legislature party at   where he called for coordinated efforts from Congressmen to prevent BJP leaders from spreading hate.
 
 “BJP leaders are out to divide the country on highly objectionable communal lines, in which BJP’s central ministers play a shameless role,” Naik said.
