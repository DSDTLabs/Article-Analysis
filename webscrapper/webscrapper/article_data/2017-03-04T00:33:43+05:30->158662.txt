A day after the security and crew members of his movie roughed up a few mediapersons on VIP Road leading to Taj Mahal in Agra, actor   on Friday apologized for the incident. “I had left the shoot an hour before the incident happened. This would not have happened had I been there...I would have given a ‘jadu ki jhappi’ to the people and would have handled it with love,” Dutt said. 

 The mediapersons claimed they were covering the traffic snarl on VIP Road caused by the film shoot. “I was trying to capture the traffic jam, but the bouncers started beating me and took away my camera, channel ID, laptop and other appliances in my bag. Other mediapersons were also roughed up,” said  , a cameraman with a news channel.
