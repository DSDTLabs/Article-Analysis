CHENNAI: Members of the   Officer's Confederation (AIBOC) on Monday demanded a rollback of  's notification on changes to bad debt recognition norms as it would cause a "financial crisis that the country can ill-afford to have now." 

 On February 12, the   had issued a circular instructing banks to consider such accounts as default where debt servicing hadn't begun within a period of 91 days. D  , general secretary, AIBOC, said that such an imposition, which takes the leeway enjoyed by private and public sector banks in the issue of postponing bad debts, was unscientific and that it would create a net loss of over 1 lakh crore. 
 
 "Small and medium enterprise borrowers face crisis of working capital flow in the market due to GST and demonetisation. The non performing asset recognition (for loans) extended to these borrowers should therefore be 180 days, instead of 90 days," Franco said.
 
 AIBOC members staged a demonstration in the evening near   to press home their demands.
