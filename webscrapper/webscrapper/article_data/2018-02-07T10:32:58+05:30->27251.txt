MANGALURU: It is a tradition to give gifts to newly married couples during their wedding ceremony. However, this couple opted to give saplings as gifts to the guests at their wedding ceremony.

 Radio Jockey Rashmi U P, who married   on Sunday, made her wedding an occasion to think and thank about nature. With the help of environmentalist Madhava   and others, she arranged a special counter in front of the marriage hall to distribute saplings of various species to all wedding guests.
 
 Accordingly, more than 400 families who participated in the wedding ceremony were gifted with various saplings at   auditorium in Ombathukere, Ullal on Sunday. Madhava Ullal, who is also the  , took the lead role in distributing saplings during the ceremony. He told TOI that Rashmi was successful in creating awareness on the environment by distributing saplings.
 
 “With great difficulty, Rashmi arranged Saguvani (sal), honge (Indian beech), nerale (black plum), kadamba (burflower) and other saplings to be given to the guests. The main intention was to make the occasion memorable by distributing saplings that will increase our green cover. All guests were requested during the ceremony to plant them in their premises and water them regularly,” Madhava said.
 
 Rashmi and her team have produced a documentary to highlight the significance of agriculture and various issues farmers face, he added.
