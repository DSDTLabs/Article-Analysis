 DEHRADUN: An MoU was signed between the   (UETDC) and   (NBCC) to undertake construction of the Kandi Road which will pass through   and shorten the travel distance from   to Kumaon by two hours. Forest minister   said that the Rs 2,000 crore project would be ready in two years.
  
  The   (WII) and the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) of the 90 km road from Kotdwar to Ramnagar.
  
  The forest minister said, â€œAround 50 km of the road will pass through CTR. We plan to build a flyover to facilitate animal movement in the 17km stretch where Corbett shares a boundary with Amangarh Tiger Reserve. The road had drawn the ire of wildlife activists since it passes through a protected reserve.
