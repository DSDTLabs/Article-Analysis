NOIDA:   of 48 apartment complexes of   62 have raised an alarm against increasing health hazards emerging from garbage and solid waste mismanagement in the sector. They said the sector has been neglected by the Noida Authority for the past several years.

 “The drains are clogged and packed with plastic bags. The drain water keeps flowing out on the roads. While garbage is collected from the societies, they are simply dumped at a local dumpyard or just along the roads. The pile-up lasts weeks and these spots become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and germs, thus spreading diseases. We have even filed a complaint with chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘Jansunwai’ department,” said Rajiva Singh, president,   (NOFAA).
 
 “We have had outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue in the past few years. We are seeking a complete clean-up of this sector,” said S P Sharma, a resident of GAIL apartments. 
 
 The locality houses mostly public sector units. Several educational institutes and coporate offices are also located there. “All residents of Sector 62 have been complaining about the spillover of drain water from time to time on the main road. This poses a health threat. The pile-up of solid waste on the surface of drains and garbage along the roads are also hazardous. We demand that garbage be disposed of immediately,” Pushkar Chandna, a resident of Sector 62, said.
 
 Apart from 48 apartment complexes, Sector 62 hosts offices of IBM, Accenture, TCS. It has residential apartments for the staff of PSUs like GAIL, BHEL, NHPC, IOC, NTPC and PMO. Institutes like CDAC, IIHM, IITM and Symbiosis are also present there. There are several banks like SBI, BOI, OBC, State Bank of Punjab and Sindh.
