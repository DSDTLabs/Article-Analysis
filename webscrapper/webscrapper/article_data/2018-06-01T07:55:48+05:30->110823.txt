Producer   is very particular in monitoring the casting process of her shows. Just a couple of days back, we told you about Ekta’s decision to replace actor   with   for her upcoming show ' '. Now, we have also learnt that actress  , who had been finalised as one of the protagonists, (Gauri’s character), has been replaced in a last-minute rejig. Ekta has decided to replace her and take   instead. 
Sources tell us, “Given how creatively involved Ekta is with 'Qayamat Ki Raat', she felt that Karishma would be a better fit for Gauri’s character. Since Ekta and Karishma share a great friendship that goes back to Karishma’s initial days in the industry, she couldn’t say no and was eventually on board. We did like Asmita, but we are glad that Karishma is now on board.”
