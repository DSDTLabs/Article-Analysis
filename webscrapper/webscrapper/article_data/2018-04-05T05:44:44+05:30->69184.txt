MUMBAI:   in Maharashtra has touched 101 lakh tons, the   in the state's history, reports  . With a month still left for the sugar season to end, officials say production could set a new record, and may even overtake highest producer UP. 

 "At this rate, we estimate production may cross the historic high of 105 lakh tons in 2014-15," said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil. 
 
 The rise in production has seen prices drop from Rs 3,600 per quintal last year to Rs 2,900 now. 
  
  
 Currently, the state is the second highest sugar producer in the country after Uttar Pradesh. Officials say the state may even surpass UP this year. Sugar production in the state is 140% higher than in 2016-17 where production was impacted by the drought.
 
 The area under   has increased by 2.7 lakh hectares over the last year. The cane area grew from 6.3 lakh hectares in 2016-17 to 9 lakh hectares in 2017-18.
 
 Kolhapur and Solapur regions led in sugar production, though the latter is an arid area. Productivity also increased from 75 tons per hectare in 2016-17 to 100 tons in 2017-18. However, the rise in production has led to a dip in sugar prices from 3,600 per quintal last year to 2,900 now.
 
 As a result, sugar factories say they are finding it difficult to pay cane farmers the   (FRP) set by the Central government at 2,550 per quintal. The pending payments to farmers have ballooned to 2,227 crore.
 
 Over time, Maharashtra has lost its traditional markets in the North and the North-east to UP which has a locational advantage.
