NEW DELHI: The   on Monday questioned UPSC member Chattar Singh in connection with its probe into alleged irregularities in the   at Panchkula in which former   chief minister   is named as an accused.

 According to the FIR, industrial plots were given to 14 people by allegedly manipulating certain provisions of allotment which included allowing them to submit their applications even after the last date of submission ended.
 
 The 14 people who had been allotted lands had submitted their applications on January 24, 2012 whereas the last date of submission was January 6, 2012, the FIR has alleged.
 
 Singh, a retired IAS officer of 1980-batch, was additional principal secretary to the chief minister from 2009-13.
 
 The case which was handed over from the vigilance bureau of Haryana to the CBI has named “the then chairman of HUDA”, the post held by Hooda, being the then CM of Haryana, three former bureaucrats, 13 beneficiaries and unknown officials of the authority and state government.
 
 The FIR also alleged that ineligible beneficiaries were allotted plots at rates lesser than the prevailing market rates, causing financial loss to the tune of several crores of rupees to the state exchequer.
 
 It is alleged that the 14 plots, ranging from 496 square metres to 1,280 square metres, were allegedly allotted at throwaway prices after changes were made midway in the eligibility criteria.
 
 Chattar Singh is under CBI scanner in another dubious land allotment by Hooda.
 
 He was raided in September last year along with Hooda and several other senior officials of state government for irregularities in land acquisition in Gurgaon, which reportedly led to loss of around Rs 1,500 crore to farmers there.
