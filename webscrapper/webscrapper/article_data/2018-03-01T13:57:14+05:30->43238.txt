  One need not to be an expert tailor to do basic alteration of a dress. It's really pretty easy to do by yourself without harming the shape of the dress. Wear the dress and stand in front of the mirror. Pin the loose part of the dress from each side. Take off the dress carefully maintaining the pins on the right spots. Now sew along the pins, and once sewed, remove the pins. 
 
 
 In this case, you don't need to do too much work. Take out all your junky jewellery and wear them all, like layers of necklaces. It could be a long- beaded necklaces or chunky pendant. This style gives your baggy dress a bohemian look and draws all the attention off your  .
 
 
 A cardigan can play a major role in turning the baggy dress into a figure-hugging dress. All you need is a cute and elegant brooch. Pull the left side across the right and then pull the right side over the top and pin it on your left with a brooch. You can even pin both the sides if you don't feel confident and safe so that it does not slip off while you spend a romantic evening with your date.
