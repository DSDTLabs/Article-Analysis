KOLKATA: A month after Calcutta   issued an order; the special crime branch of CBI started a probe into the murder of  , a CPM leader at Burdwan. Mukherjee was shot dead by unknown miscreants in 2012.   ordered a CBI probe after his son appealed for the same.

 The case dates back to 2012 when Mukherjee went out for a morning walk on May 11. A civil contractor and son of former CPM MLA Bamapada Mukherjee, Arpan went out for a walk near Burnpur stadium when assailants attacked him and opened fire at him. Mukherjee died on the spot after multiple bullet injuries. Five spent cartridge shells were found from the spot afterwards.
 
 Hirapur police station lodged a murder case against unknown persons but they could not make much headway till December last year. Unhappy with the progress of investigation, Mukherjee's son Arkadeb prayed to transfer the case to the CID. While the state investigating agency conducted a probe, the probe did not advance much and the miscreants are still at large. Arkadeb lodged a prayer with the Calcutta High Court and Justice   ordered CBI probe in March this year. A month after the order CBI lodged an FIR in the case against unknown miscreants.
 
 Justice Bagchi had also noted that while police took statements of at least seven of the morning walkers but neither their statements were recorded under 161 CrPC, nor were they video-graphed. He also mentioned that the victim was no stranger to the witnesses. He had also noted that soon after Mukherjee was murdered, two   were also gunned down in the "similar way" in Burnpur. The judge had asked the CBI to submit a report with it within three months.
