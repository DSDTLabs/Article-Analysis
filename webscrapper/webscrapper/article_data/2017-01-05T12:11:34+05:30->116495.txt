CHENNAI: Continuing the workshop series on brain research,   has extended the second annual workshop on   until January 7.

 The institute had set up three chairs to focus on computational brain research, as it believes there is a lot more to be explored in the field. Through the Centre for Computational Brain Research (CCBR), it hopes to explore the interface between neuroscience and engineering disciplines. The first such series was held in January 2016.
 
 Infosys co-founder and IIT-M alumnus   said the aim of the workshop was knowledge sharing and bringing in as many people possible to share rese arch aspects. “There are about 100 participants within   and 50 from outside as part of the workshop. The workshop is being held in conjunction with a corresponding workshop on Computational Brain Research at IISc, Bangalore from January 9 to 13,“ he said.
 
 The series also hopes to shed light on the work done in the field so far through the institute. The technical focus of the workshop is to raise awareness on machine learning, neuroscience, and neuromorphic engineering, while it also hopes to foster national and international collaborations.
 
 Prof. R  , dean, international and alumni relations, IIT Madras, said, “This year's workshop will deepen and broaden the engagement between neuroscience and engineering“.
