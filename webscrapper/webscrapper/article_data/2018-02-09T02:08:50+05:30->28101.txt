Mumbai: A   suspect was stripped and beaten by locals when he was caught leaving a house in Umela   in   (west) recently.

 The suspect, Praveen Kushawah, came from Dadra and Nagar Haveli to the village and entered the house of Poojan Khusal on Tuesday, said the police on Thursday. He suffered fractures in both arms when he was beaten by a mob, said the police.
 
 Around 8 pm on Tuesday, Khusal stepped out to buy groceries, locking the door to her house. On returning 30 minutes later, she found her household items, including the television and other electronics, placed outside the house. She sensed the presence of a thief and raised an alarm, and the man inside latched the door and switched off the lights. 
 
 As the screaming did not stop, the thief opened the door and began to flee. Khusalâ€™s screams alerted the neighbours, who chased the thief. The villaghers finally caught Khushawah in the nearby fields.
 
 Kushawah was brought to the compound of the house, where he was disrobed and beaten till the police arrived. Admitted to JJ hospital, he was discharged on Thursday. tnn
