NEW DELHI: Amid reports of an   surge in Punjab,   is optimistic about its chances, believing that BJP’s meltdown in urban areas will boost its tally supplementing an overwhelming show in Doaba and Manjha regions.

 As voting ended on Saturday, Congress managers conceded a challenge from AAP but claimed that the newbie would be limited to pockets of Malwa. The claims come on the back of ground reports in favour of AAP with an appeal cutting across Dalits and youth. Its pandering to ‘panthic’ sentiments and the support from “hardliners” has been another much talked about feature.
 
 But post-poll, a Congress candidate claimed ‘hype’ was a big reason for reports favouring AAP, confident of his own chances as that of his party. According to party pollsters, Congress will “sweep” Manjha and Doaba while also not giving AAP a walkover in the largest region which may be the latter’s stronghold — Malwa.
 
 Besides, leaders expressed confidence about netting “Hindu” voters in cities who have “definitely left” the BJPSAD alliance but have not gone to AAP because of its dalliance with hardline elements.
 
 The concern in Congress circles has been about the surge AAP received with its aggressive campaign among rural voters. A known fact is that SAD has traditionally run on the twin legs of “politics and religion”. With the disappointment over “corruption and drugs” pushing the core vote base away from the Akali camp, AAP threw its net wide.
 
 In the run-up to the polls, there was resentment in Congress over the delay in finalising candidates which partymen lamented had cost them much time. There was also discontent over the prolonged war of wits between vice-president   and Amarinder Singh, before “Captain” was handed over the reins of the state unit. It remains to be seen how much have these factors cost the party electorally.
