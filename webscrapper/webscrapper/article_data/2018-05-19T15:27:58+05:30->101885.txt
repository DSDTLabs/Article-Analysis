 After wooing everyone with her stylish avatar in the trailer, she is all set to mesmerise us again with her promotional looks. And in less than 24 hours, she has already sported three stylish looks (and counting). Her first look which we loved was a blue sassy ensemble by Pinnacle. For this outfit, she kept her accessories minimal with a delicate neckpiece and stud earrings.

 Kareena swapped this look with another stylish number. This time she stunned us with a corset style top paired with a pair of matching structured pants. She accessorised this look with chunky earrings and kept her make-up on point with heavily kohled eyes and a glossy lip colour.

 And this morning, she got off on a high sartorial note with an Indo-western look. She wore a white shirt-esque kurta with white bottoms by AJSK Gulabo. She accessorised the look with statement earrings and metallic Indian juttis.
