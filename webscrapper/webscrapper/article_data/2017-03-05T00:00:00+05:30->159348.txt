The 4th of each month is observed as Bus Day in Bengaluru. And, on Saturday, a group of Bengalureans, many of who were the muscle behind the campaign (#SteelFlyoverBeda) that forced the government to revoke the idea of constructing the steel flyover, gathered at the Shantinagar TTMC (Traffic Transit Management Centre) to launch their new campaign — #BusBhagyaBeku. This is to demand that the government provide financial support to the BMTC, so that it can ‘halve the fares, and double the fleet’, thereby benefitting thousands of city folk who rely on public transport daily. The campaign is also aimed at getting private vehicles off the roads, to reduce traffic congestion and pollution.

 
  
 To show their support, people from as far as Vidyaranyapura and Whitefield boarded a bus and made their way to the Shantinagar bus stop. Among them were actresses   and  , who boarded a bus from Jayanagar. Swarathma’s   surprised people at the Jayanagar bus terminus with an impromptu musical performance. Other celebrities, such as rock band Thermal And A Quarter’s  , actor  , theatre person Gowri Dattu and singer   (who boarded a bus from Banashanakari), assembled at the Shantinagar bus stand to throw their weight behind the campaign.
 
  
  
 Speaking about the event, Srinivas Alavilli of  , who organized the event, says “A total of 600-700 people supported our cause today. Among those who turned up were people from unorganized sectors, such as the garment and street vendors union. BMTC workers also turned up. We read out our demands to BMTC Chairman M   and Managing Director Ekroop Caur. They said that they understand our concern and are trying to increase the number of buses on their fleet. Regarding the reduction in fares, they will address our concerns with Chief Minister  , and once he allots funds for it, the BMTC has no objection with reducing the fares.”
