NEW DELHI: Opposition candidate   congratulated rival   on becoming President-elect, saying the victory placed on him the onerous task of upholding the Constitution.

 “My best wishes are with Kovindji as it has fallen upon him to uphold the Constitution in letter and spirit in these challenging times,“ Kumar said, in what appeared a reference to her campaign theme that Constitutional values were under threat under the   government.
 
 Meira Kumar added, “My fight for secularism, the oppressed and the marginalised continues. I thank all my well-wishers for their support and good wishes.“ She also thanked the opposition parties who fielded him.
 
 In her congratulatory message to Kovind, Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi said, “The President is the conscience-keeper of the Constitution.“ She said Congress was committed to work to uphold Constitutional values.
 
 After Meira Kumar's defeat, Congress pointed to the good tally she received as an opposition nominee. “Kumar has secured the maximum votes ever won by the opposition candidate in the Presidential elections,“ Kumar's election agent and Congress MP Deepender Hooda said.Yechury congratulated Kumar for “a spirited fight“.
 
 Hooda added that crossvoting from Congress and opposition parties had only happened along the expected lines and the overall result was a good show for the unity in the opposition camp.
 
 AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala said Congress hopes the President will hold a mirror to the government that was “power drunk“ on its numerical strength in parliament, showing it the right path.
 
 While complimenting Kovind, CPM chief Sitaram Yechury said, “Our fight for a plural, harmonious, equitable and just India continues.“
