CUTTACK: Inspired by prime minister  's cashless mantra, the   (RTO) has decided to launch   in the city. 

 RTO   said the transport department is in the process of creating a smartphone application that the traffic police and transport officials could use to issue challans on the spot for traffic-related violations. The system will also enable police to collect penalty through debit cards, credit cards and online banking from the violators.
 
 The move will have multiple benefits. Besides checking corruption, the initiative will also help RTO to go paperless and it will also enable authorities to keep a tab on habitual offenders.
 
 Patra said handheld e-challan devices equipped with GPS based application will be provided to the traffic personnel and transport official. The App would be integrated with the database of transport department and police. With just the feeding of the vehicles registration number and the pressing of a button all related details about the vehicle will be flashed on the screen of the devices.
 
 The RTO explained that whenever someone is caught violating a traffic rule, a challan would be generated by the machine against the vehicle's registration number. The challan with the fine amount would be texted to the person's cellphone immediately. After receiving the challan, the violator will be given the options for digital payment. "The handheld devices will be equipped with the facility to swipe cards so that violators can pay the fine on the spot. People can pay the fines through credit or debit cards or e-wallets," said a transport official. If one does not have plastic money options, he/she will be given a weeks time to deposit the fine amount.
