COLVA: The department of fisheries seems to have abandoned its plans of building a retaining wall at Cavelossim beach. The wall was part of upgradation of fishing jetties at Cutbona in Betul, south Goa, and Chapora in north Goa. It was to be undertaken at a cost of Rs 100 crore.

 Last February, Goa   (GCZMA) had ordered the directorate of fisheries to stop work with immediate effect as the latter had not obtained prior approval for the purpose of alleged construction as required under CRZ notification 1991/2011. They also did not have the mandatory environment clearance from environment ministry.
 
 President of  , Iris  , had taken up the issue with GCZMA of illegal mud dumping activities, destruction of sand dunes and illegal construction of road in the no-development zone (NDZ). He had said that the illegal activities in the NDZ would cause severe degradation to the coastal environment, ecosystem and ecology.
 
 Fisheries director   told STOI that the matter is before the   (NGT). A retaining wall, to prevent formation of a sandbar at the mouth of the river, has been a long-standing demand of trawler owners. During the monsoon, the sandbar hinders trawler movements and after the fishing ban is lifted as they have to wait for the tide.
 
 Last February, the contractor engaged for the project had dumped construction material including boulders, graphite stones, mud, cement bags, tetrablocks which were subsequently removed after TOI had highlighted it. But, till today some material such as graphite stones are yet to be removed.
