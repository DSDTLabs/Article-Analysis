To facilitate the process, the city survey has been done in a few pockets whereas other villages will also be covered shortly.”
 
 After acquisition of land for developing Navi Mumbai in 1970’s, no city survey has been done hitherto that left the project affected persons in dilemma who are unable to regularize their houses after extension.

Many PAP families in the 29 villages which had given their land for creation of Navi Mumbai could not expand their homes as per requirement due to lack of property card which comprises the data of land records. “I have been following this issue at various levels. The city survey is underway. During the meeting with district administration on Thursday I have been assured that property cards will soon be issued to PAPs,” said Belapur MLA Manda Mhatre.
