JODHPUR: Poonam Chand and  , the two eyewitnesses whose accounts were crucial in getting actor Salman Khan convicted in the blackbuck poaching case at  , are not happy with the judgment of the trial court.

 Though unwilling to dwell on the case, they were of the view that the co-accused, who were acquitted, should also be declared guilty for justice to be complete.
 
 In a chat with TOI at his residence in  , Chhogaram, who has not been well for long, said that whatever they had done was in accordance with the principles of wildlife and environmental protection traditionally followed by the   community.
 
 “It didn’t concern us that it was a film star or a common man. What was important was the fact that the animal which we revere and co-exist with us was killed. We are committed to protecting it,” he said.
 
 Poonam Chand, who was about 40 years then, first heard the gunshot and the sound of a vehicle on the night of October 1-2, 1998. He woke his cousin Chhogaram, who was sleeping outside on a cot in the neighbouring house in   ki Dhani, in the dead of the night.
 
 They then chased the Gypsy, driven by Salman, for about 2km on their motorcycle.
 
 Both of them then contacted a forest official, went to the forest department the next morning and filed a complaint on October 2, 1998, which led to Salman’s conviction.
 
 “Our community is known for having sacrificed lives for protecting the ‘khejadi’ trees from being cut. These people come to our territory for killing animals, just for the sake of joy,” he said.
 
 All these 20 years, Chhogaram was not able to appear before the court during the trial on account of his persistent illness. But Poonam Chand stuck to his guns and never showed any sign of backing off, despite the accused being a powerful and popular personality.
