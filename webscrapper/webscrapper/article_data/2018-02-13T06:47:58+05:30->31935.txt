BENGALURU:   (CCB) sleuths, investigating the murder of K Santosh, said they have recovered a knife used in the   killing. Initially, police said the accused had stabbed Santosh with a screwdriver, inflicting serious thigh injuries. He died on January 31. 

 Police had arrested four, including prime accused Wasim who is the son of block   leader Khader. "We thought Santosh had used a screwdriver. But the doctor said the injuries indicated that a different weapon had been used. Wasim confessed it was a knife," police said. They recovered the weapon hidden near his house.
 
 Asked why he had misled police, Wasim told the officers, "I knew the charges would be more severe for using a knife than a screwdriver."
 
 Santosh, a goods autorickshaw driver, had objected to Wasim smoking ganja. Wasim then barged into Santosh's house and warned his mother that he would teach him a lesson. On January 31, Santosh shouted at Wasim and the latter stabbed him and fled. Santosh was rushed to   where he died while undergoing treatment.
