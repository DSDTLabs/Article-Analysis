 According to residents, Rs 3 lakh was used only to fill the potholes near the township while the entire repair work would need Rs 10 lakh. 
 
 “It has been more than 15 years since we have been asking the authorities and the developer to repair the internal roads. As our requests fell on deaf ears, we pooled in money to carry out the repair work. 
 
 “While some families donated Rs 5,000 each, there were a few who contributed Rs 20,000. So far, we have collected Rs 4 lakh and need at least Rs 10 lakh to repair the entire stretch,” said Abhay Punia, a resident of Suncity.
 
 “Owing to the poor condition of the road, last year an elderly resident fell down during morning walk and fractured his pelvic bone. The injury was so terrible that he passed away within a month. It is not the lone incident. Bad roads have led to many accidents in the township,” said Kuldeep Rana, president of Suncity RWA.
 
 “I have suffered travelling on this stretch many a time. Last year, when I was returning from office my car got stuck in one of the potholes. A friend of mine, who was in the car, suffered a major back pain due to a jerk received on this stretch. We have been waiting for the road repair since ages. I’m glad that the residents’ initiative to repair road will make life easier for at least a few days,” Karan Shrivastava, another resident.
 
 “We are requesting residents to come forward and contribute towards the road repair,” said VMK Singh, general secretary of Suncity RWA.
 
 When asked, an official of MCG said, “The process of takeover of Suncity is on. A major budget has been allocated for road infrastructure. However, we can’t do anything unless the area is taken over by the corporation.” 
 
 However, the estate manager for Suncity, Harinder, remained unavailable for his comments.
