Vijayawada: The Tirumala darshan and Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation’s (APSRTC) travel combo ticket is becoming increasing popular among devotees. APSRTC has an understanding with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( ) to provide special quota tickets to its passengers. 

 The state-run corporation is providing Rs 300-darshan tickets to long distance travellers to Tirupati in all APSRTC services. The corporation can sell 1,000 darshan tickets on a daily basis. 
 
 This is a hassle-free option for devotees planning a Tirumala visit. It helps them plan their travel in advance. Earlier, booking darshan slots was considered a difficult and tedious process. The darshan tickets and bus tickets can be bought online from the APSRTC website.
 
 Chief traffic manager (CTM) KS Brahmananda Reddy told TOI that the people have appreciated the new system as more than 90 per cent of the reserved tickets are bought even on lean days.
 
 The combo ticket facility is available on as many as 470 services across the state. Further, a special counter has been opened for the APSRTC devotees at Tirupati. The officials in the special counter arrange the darshan for the devotees.
 
 Krishna Mohan Surapaneni, a native of Gudivada who settled in the US, utilised the service recently. He said the Tirumala darshan process was extremely simplified. “I was on a tight schedule during my visit to India. I checked various options on the internet. When I came across combo-ticket, I was delighted. It is smooth and hassle-free. Everything went according to plan. However, it would be much better if APSRTC could link lodging facility as well,” he said.
