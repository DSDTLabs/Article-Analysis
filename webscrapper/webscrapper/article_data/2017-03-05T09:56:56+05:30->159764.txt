AURANGABAD: After about a decade, residents of   and nearby localities would be supplied drinking water from elevated water reservoir (ESR) as the   has decided to connect it to the water distribution network.

 The ESR, with a capacity of 26 lakh liter, was lying defunct all these years. When the people’s representatives raised this issue, the civic body promised to make it functional within the next 10 to 15 days.
 
 “When the city’s water distribution system was under the control of a private company, it could not make use of it. But now we will start filling the ERS and supply its water to Indira Nagar, Deshmukh Nagar, Laxmi Nagar, R B Hills, Emerald City and other localities. It will also reduce water scarcity in many parts of Satara and Devali,” said   (AMC) executive engineer Sartaj Singh Chahel.
 
 The facility built by the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) in 2005-06 is still lying unutilised at Shivaji Nagar. Initially, it was the MJP that delayed transfer of the facility to Aurangabad Municipal Corporation. Later the AMC could not connect the reservoirs to its network of internal pipelines.
 
 “There were some unresolved issues that were coming in way of transfer and eventually the facility was lying unutilised,” sources in the AMC told TOI.
 
 For the past two to three years,   corporator   has been demanding that use of available resources would give a sigh of relief to over 15,000 residents.
 
 “The reservoir will also help residents of Satara-Devlai area get water. But because of the AMC’s lackluster approach thousands of residents in these localities are facing water scarcity,” he said.
