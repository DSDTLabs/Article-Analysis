PATNA: Bihar   (BEPC), a wing of the state education department, on Friday announced the schedule for the annual examinations of Classes I to VIII in government and government-aided schools across the state (excluding   district). The examinations will be held between March 12 and 18.

 Around 2 crore students of Classes I to VIII will write their first language paper (Hindi or  ) at 73,000 government and government-aided schools in the state in two sittings on March 12. In first sitting, students of Classes I to V will appear and in the second sitting, students of Classes VI to VIII will write their papers.
 
 Students will write English paper on March 13, mathematics on March 14, social science on March 15, Hindi or Sanskrit on March 17 and practical assessment on March 16 and March 18.
 
 BEPC state project director   said the question papers and answer sheets for Classes I to VIII were already dispatched to the district education officers (DEOs).
 
 “School principals and teachers have been asked to conduct the exams in a free and fair manner. The answer sheets will be evaluated at the cluster resource centre and block resource centre. Students will get A, B, C and D grades depending on their performance. The results will be announced in the first week of April,” Singh said.
 
 Schools have also been asked to hold parent-teacher meetings to discuss the progress report of students. “The council started conducting the annual exam of Classes I to VIII in government schools two years ago to assess the performance of the students. Though no student will be detained, the annual exams are being held to judge the performance of the students.”
 
 The BEPC has asked the Araria DEO to hold the exams after the completion of Lok Sabha bypolls there.
