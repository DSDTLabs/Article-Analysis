FEROZEPUR: With heavy   for past few days in parts of Ferozepur district,   was damaged on Friday. Agriculture experts said that heavy rain coupled with hailstorm would adversely affect crops like wheat, mustard and green fodder.

 As per information, rain and hailstorm flattened wheat crop at several places in the district. Farmers who had irrigated wheat crop recently suffered more damage as fields got waterlogged. Wheat was sown over about 1.97 lakh hectares in the district.
 
 Jaspreet Singh, a farmer of Rukna Begu village, said his wheat crop over seven acres had been flattened and he had irrigated the fields only two days ago.
 
 Agriculture department officials, however, said damage to wheat in the district would be minimal and rather the dip in temperature following the rain would benefit the crop. Ferozepur chief agriculture officer Satinder Kaur said the flattened crop would regain its balance after a couple of days.
