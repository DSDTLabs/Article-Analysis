Guru   might be talking about trends and brands in his song ' ', but in reality, his exposure to luxury labels happened in Delhi. The singer spent a few years in Delhi for his MBA, and he says, "Delhi taught me how to dress, how to talk to girls, how to talk to people. I come from  . It is in Delhi that I first saw a Mercedes or a BMW." He used to stay in   during his MBA days, and hang out at a mall in   in his free time. "I didn’t hang out much, I was mostly busy with my studies and music. I was always working towards fulfilling my dreams, because I wanted to be an example back at home." His MBA course gave him the confidence to speak in public. "The presentations I used to give during my course have helped in building my confidence of talking to people, which is a big part of the industry I am in," said the singer, who performed at the IIMC ( ) recently.

  The DU fest season is on and the 'Suit' singer has been performing at many colleges. "Last year I probably performed in about nine colleges – I don’t think anyone has done so many shows in a single year. This year, too, our schedule is packed, but I am going to start my Punjabi movie soon, so we are not taking too many bookings. Performing in a college campus is a very different experience. The audience of your age group has a different kind of energy. They love singing with you. You see yourself in them. Weddings and corporate events are different, with people from all age groups, and you perform there for the money," he says, adding, "I end up being in Delhi the most because of my shows. I get a lot of love here. This city has helped me a lot in building my career."
