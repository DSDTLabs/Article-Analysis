Pune: The Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) is starting a postgraduate technology (MTech) course in corrosion this year, for Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) scientists and army personnel. 

 The institute will also introduce a one-year postgraduate diploma in fire engineering and integrated safety management. Vice Chancellor P K Khanna told TOI, “Both courses are open for army personnel and DRDO scientists with a 20 students capacity. We may open courses for others later.”
 
 Corrosion engineering is important in the armed forces and DRDO. The specialised master courses are the need of the hour considering the current technological demands of the forces. DRDO scientists and DIAT professors have designed the syllabus. Private industry experts will also be roped in to give special lectures, Khanna said.
 
 The engineering course will be conducted in collaboration with the DRDO’s Centre for Fire, Explosives and Environmental Safety laboratory in New Delhi. 
 
 “Fire safety is very important since the DRDO and armed forces work on sensitive projects. Thwarting fire accidents in defence establishments and laboratories can be a daunting task which is why it is the need of the hour to train them scientifically. The course will be both academic and practical,” a senior DRDO scientist said.
