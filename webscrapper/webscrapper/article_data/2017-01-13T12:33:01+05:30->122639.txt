Sandalwood stars have been practising a new format of cricket for the last few weeks. Starting this week, they will showcase their special talent in the first ever Box Cricket League (BCL) in Kannada. The game show mixes reality television with sports that sets it apart from other game/reality shows on television.
 
  Producer and actor  , who is behind the project, has also launched a Tollywood verion of it with Telugu actors. The Kannada show will start airing from Saturday on   and Suvarna Plus channels. There will be two matches every week on Saturday and Sunday.
  
  The opening week will have an inauguration of the tournament and a friendly match between a media team and stars drawn from all the six teams.
  
  There are six teams representing six districts; Bengaluru Dragons, Bellary Blasters, Mysuru Tigers, Davanagere Lions, Mangaluru Sharks and Hubbali Hunters. Raghu Mukherjee, Dhananjaya, Dinakar Toogudeepa, Adi Lokesh, RJ Rohit and   are the captains of these teams respectively. All vice captains — Ramya Barna,
