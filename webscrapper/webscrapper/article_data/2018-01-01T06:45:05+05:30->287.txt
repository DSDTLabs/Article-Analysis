LUCKNOW: Objecting to the rampant illegal use of UP government emblem on their letterheads, Speaker   has directed all former legislators to stop using the official emblem in their written communication. 

 The order is applicable on former chief ministers also. Only those who are members of either the UP assembly or legislative council can use the insignia. 
 
 This is the first time that such an order has been passed by the Speaker. It aims to check large-scale usage of government emblem by former members of the House.
 
 Principal secretary, assembly,   confirmed that a letter had been issued to nearly 2,500 former MLAs and MLCs asking them not to use the official emblem of UP government and assembly in their letterheads for any purpose. 
 
 Talking to TOI, Speaker   said that no former   or MLC could use the official emblem once he or she lost membership of either House. 
 
 
 
 
 Unfortunately, it has been noticed that the practice of using government logo by former members of the House is rampant. It is an unlawful activity because when one ceases to be the member of the House, one is not authorized to use the official emblem,” said Dixit.
 
 He added that a similar matter had been brought to his notice by governor Ram Naik some time ago.
 
 The governor had shown a copy of a letter by a former MLA using the official emblem in his correspondence. Naik had sought action if it was illegal. The Speaker has asked his secretariat to immediately issue the advisory.
 
 A few days ago, on the last day of the winter session, the Speaker had announced a “laxman rekha” for members of the assembly. He had said that he would not tolerate indiscipline in the House such as disruption by continuous whistling, throwing paper balls at the governor and the chair and showing placards and banners.
