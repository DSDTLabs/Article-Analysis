CHENNAI: In a big jolt to the ruling  , party MLA A Prabhu representing Kallakurichi on Friday met TTV Dhinakaran and expressed his solidarity with the dissident leader.

 He is the 21st MLA to openly support Dhinakaran. Prabhu met the rebel leader at the latter's Adyar residence in  . He was accompanied by former minister P Palaniappan.
 
 Prabhu said the outcome of the RK Nagar by election proved Dhinakaran’s popularity. "I am unable to do public service in my own constituency. Wish all MLAs from the ruling camp strengthen the hands of Dhinakaran and fulfil the aspirations of former CM J Jayalalithaa," he told reporters, after meeting Dhinakaran.
 
 At least 18 MLAs, who rebelled against EPS-OPS leadership and sided with Dhinakaran, have been disqualified by the party. The disqualification has been challenged in the high court and the verdict is expected any time. The stability of the EPS government hinges on the outcome of the verdict.
 
 In a high voltage electoral battle in R K Nagar constituency in December, Dhinakaran won the seat held by former chief minister K Jayalalithaa. MLAs E A Rathinasabapathy (Aranthangi) and VT Kalaiselvan (Vridhachalam) have already endorsed Dhinakaran’s leadership. 
 
 In the 234 member  , the ruling AIADMK has the support of 113 MLAs, excluding Speaker. The main opposition, DMK and its allies,   and IUML have 98 representatives.
