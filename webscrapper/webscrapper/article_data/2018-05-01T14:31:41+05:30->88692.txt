Shah Rukh Khan, Sushmita Sen, Zayed Khan, Amrita Rao, Suniel Shetty and   starrer 'Main Hoon Na' became one of the biggest hits of 2004. The film marked the directorial debut of choreographer  . Yesterday the film completed 14 years and the stars took to Twitter to reminisce about working on this 
 . 

 Boman Irani, who played the absent-minded professor in the film tweeted "14 long years, endless memories, one beautiful journey. Lots and lots of Love @iamsrk, my dearest Farracles @TheFarahKhan, @SunielVShetty, @thesushmitasen and the entire #MainHoonNa team. #14YearsOfMainHoonNa".
 
  
  
 To this Shah Rukh Khan replied "How much fun we all had doing this. Only @TheFarahKhan could have managed fun and success in such a huge dose."
 
  
  
 Sushmita Sen also replied to the tweet and wrote "ThankU for all the love!!!🙏❤️😍I celebrate with you!!💃🏻❤️ And always thank my #QueenMaker @TheFarahKhan for making this #memorable film! 14 years of her #debut as a celebrated #Director 👍❤️love & kisses 2 the entire #MainHoonNa family 😍love u!"
 
  
  
 Well, we must say even after 14 years the magic of 'Main Hoon Na' still remains the same within the stars and the audience. We really wish Farah Khan makes a sequel of this film.
