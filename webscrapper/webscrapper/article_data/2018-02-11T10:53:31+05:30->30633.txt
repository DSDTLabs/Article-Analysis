VISAKHAPATNAM:   ambassador to India Moe   spoke about the crucial role that Myanmar can play in strengthening, Indo-Asean trade links the common areas of interest between India and Myanmar and described the   as a problem that has much to do with ‘illegal migration’.

Contrary to the opinion of many, it is actually an issue concerning illegal migration and as per the 1982 Citizenship Law of Myanmar, anybody deemed to be an illegal migrant will be deported.” The Ambassador added that a nationality verification process was on in Myanmar and once it is completed the real number of illegal migrants would be out.

He said, “We have a lot of trade potential to exploit, especially in areas such as agriculture, education, mining and manufacturing industry.” Pointing out that India and Myanmar had a lot in common, he explained that unlike other Asean nations, there was a huge scope for Indian investments in infrastructure
