While most actresses would go on a movie signing spree after delivering a hit,   chose to take it easy. After wowing the audience and critics alike with ‘Neerja’ in February last year, the actress hasn’t signed any project besides her home production ‘Veere Di Wedding’. Before she starts shooting for the chick flick in May, Sonam is making the most of her off-duty time.

 The actress has headed off to Austria for a vacay with her sister  . Sonam has been posting beautiful pictures of herself posing on snow-clad mountains of Austria. And looks like the quaint locales of Altaussee have put the ‘Raanjhanaa’ actress in an introspective mode – Sonam has quoted beautiful lines from   and Meghan Daume’s works in her posts.
