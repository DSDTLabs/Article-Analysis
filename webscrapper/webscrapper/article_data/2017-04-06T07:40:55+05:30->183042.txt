BELAGAVI: After a massive crackdown on adulterated milk in   and border areas, the Food Safety and   ( ) has said that the sweets sold by local vendors are not safe for consumption.

 A detailed probe by the Belagavi food authority officials revealed that ‘Bombay halwa’, a local sweet, contained excessive food colour. According to FSSAI, only 0.5% edible colour can be added for preparing 1kg halwa. “If the colour added is more than the prescribed limit, sweet products can be pose health risks like cancer, high blood pressure and diabetes,” officials said.
 
 Officials said they examined sweet samples for a well-known shop in Bhagya Nagar area in Belagavi. “We have warned all sweet shop owners and asked them to use edible colours according to the prescribed limits. During a raid recently, we tested sweets from a shop in Bhagya Nagar. Results revealed that the food colour was more than the required limit. We are waiting for orders from FSSAI commissioner to lodge a case against the shop owner,” said Mahadevi Bekkeri, FSSAI district officer.
 
 Officials said they also found excessive colours in ‘pharsan’, a local snack. “We recently imposed a fine of Rs 2 lakh on a packaged water manufacturing unit in Belagavi. However, staff crisis is affecting our operations in Belagavi. We struggle to nab culprits involved in food adulteration due to lack of trained officers,” Bekkeri added.
