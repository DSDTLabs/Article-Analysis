NAGPUR: The   (NSUI) on Monday set a deadline of one month for the Nagpur University (NU) to clean up the mess on its properties and warned of forcing vice-chancellor SP Kane to take up the broom if its toilets remain unclean.

 “If the country’s prime minister can take up the broom, why can’t the VC do it to set an example,” said NSUI state vice-president Ajit Singh.
 
 In the morning, NSUI had staged a protest at the NU’s Civil Lines office over poor sanitary conditions at PG departments, hostels, and other university buildings.
 
 Since the agitation coincided with ‘Marathi Gaurav Din’ celebrations at the NU, the protesters persuaded university officials to begin the drive by washing toilets. “The toilets at the main office weren’t washed for over a year. We demanded that they immediately clean them with water,” Singh said.
 
 Later, a delegation led by Singh handed over a letter to registrar Puran Meshram in the absence of Kane, who was out of station.
 
 They stated in the letter that every day, hundreds of students visit the university as well as different departments and every time they face the same problem as there is no safe drinking water nor clean toilets.
 
 “We told Meshram that all NU buildings are never swept and toilets are also stinking. Some toilets haven’t seen cleaning for over a year. He assured us to form a disciplinary committee and take action after fixing responsibility,” Singh said.
 
 He added that the students will observe what action the university officials takes for the next one month, and take the protest directly to VC’s office if they don’t clean up the mess.
