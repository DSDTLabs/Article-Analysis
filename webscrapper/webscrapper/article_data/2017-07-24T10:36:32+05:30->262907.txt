CHANDIGARH:   has appealed to the   (MEA) to   for   who had issued “brazen threats” to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh during a Baisakhi parade in Surrey, British Columbia, on April 22. 

 Though the Indian high commission in Canada had lodged a “formal complaint” to Global Affairs-Canada, the foreign office the country, a week after the purported threats to Amarinder, three leaders of the Congress claimed here on Sunday that Canadian government was trying to cover up the threats, as it had decided to close investigations into the plaint. “The MEA should seek Trudeau’s intervention to ensure that those guilty of using the country’s soil to issue open and violent threats to the Punjab MC are not allowed a freerun,” demanded Congress leaders Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Ramanjit Singh Sikki.
 
 The Punjab Congress has called for activation of all international diplomatic channels to pressure the Canadian government to take necessary steps to check proliferation of “anti-India forces” on their soil. “We also want to know the status of the frivolous case filed against Amarinder by Sikhs For Justice to prevent him from visiting the Western nation,” they added.
 
 The leaders said it was evident that a proper inquiry had not been carried out with respect to the formal complaint lodged by the Indian high commission in Ottawa to Global Affairs-Canada. India had filed the formal complaint after videos of the April 22 Baisakhi Day event in British Columbia’s Surrey city had surfaced. The videos showed pro-Khalistani elements issuing threats as part of the hate speeches made by Sikh radicals operating from Canadian soil.
