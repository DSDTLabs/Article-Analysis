PATIALA: Having suffered a drubbing in the Punjab assembly elections, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has turned its focus on the   assembly constituency of Delhi where a byelection is scheduled to be held soon. SAD is likely to field Manjinder Singh Sirsa as its candidate.

 Sirsa is the general secretary of   (DSGMC). He lost to Jarnail Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the 2015 Delhi elections from Rajouri Garden.
 
 Jarnail had vacated his seat to contest the poll from Lambi constituency against SAD patron   and state Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh. AAP has fielded Harjeet Singh to contest from Rajouri Garden in place of Jarnail Singh.
 
 Confirming the party's decision, Sirsa said a final decision whether to contest the elections on a party symbol would be taken after a meeting with SAD Patron Badal and president Sukhbir Singh Badal.
