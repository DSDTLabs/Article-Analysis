HYDERABAD: A day after taking on   over its claims on state’s market borrowings, chief minister   on Wednesday was at it again making no bones about his displeasure with constant criticism from the Opposition, especially BJP, on the financial position of the state and rules for borrowings.

 So much so, the CM urged the members to take down notes of what he was telling them so that they could understand it thoroughly. “Tell me which BJP government in the country has not taken loans,” he asked BJP MLC N Ramachander Rao.
 
 “It is a question of wisdom of the economy,” he said, describing why loans had to be taken. “Loans can be taken only up to 21 per cent of the GDP. That is the rule and the Telangana government has not flouted it,” he said.
 
 The CM said that the state was forced to avail itself of Rs 9,000-crore loan under the central Uday scheme. The chief minister said that   power minister   had prevailed upon the state to take the loan.
 
 Not stopping at that, the CM said that India’s borrowings stand at Rs 80,000 lakh crore, of which Rs 20,000 lakh crore was taken after the   government came to power at the Centre.
 
 KCR went on to say, “We are creating capital assets. The loans that we are taking are being used for proper purposes.” Finance minister  , who was also present, said that the loans were being taken to create capital assets.
