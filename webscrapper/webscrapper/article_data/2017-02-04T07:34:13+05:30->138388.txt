HYDERABAD: The proposed   may not materialise in the near future as the ministry has not committed on the target date for completion of the ambitious project that links the upcoming AP capital city with the two main railway lines ­   and Chennai-Delhi.

 “Since the completion of project depends upon several factors including complete handing over of encumbrance-free land by the state government, shifting of utilities, etc and most of these factors are beyond the control of ministry of railways, target date for completion of the project has not been fixed,“ said Union minister of state for railways  .
 
 In a written reply to YSRCP MP   in the Rajya Sabha, the minister said the railways has estimated that the project requires Rs 2,679.59 crore. A new railway line will be laid from Nambur ( ) to Errupalem village on the AP-Telangana border. As many as 17 railway stations including a bridge across the river Krishna at Amaravati village are part of the project.The historical Amaravati as well as the capital city will be covered by the new rail line.
