PANAJI: Making a serious accusation against the Election Commission of India’s (ECI) role in the state assembly elections, Congress alleged that several procedural lapses were facilitated by the chief electoral officer (CEO) to favour the   (BJP).   secretary   stated that the office of the CEO was leaking information to the BJP and called for the ECI to immediately scrap the postal ballot system adopted for service voters and to instead hold elections for the 17,000-odd government employees through electronic voting machines (EVMs).

 Chodankar said that Congress was in the process of filing a complaint with the ECI based on further evidence.
 
 “There is no level playing field. Canvassing in various forms including through intimidation by the BJP is on. They should scrap the ballot paper route because there are too many lapses,” Chodankar said.
 
 Congress is the latest political party to sound the alarm with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, Goa Forward and   already challenging the postal ballot process. Chodankar hinted that a joint meeting of all the political parties could be on the cards to unitedly give a representation before the ECI. Pointing out that the ECI guidelines allowed for marked electoral rolls, with service voters identified, to be given to the political parties when postal ballots are used for service voters. The marked rolls, with PB written for those who are service voters, were provided only to BJP and that BJP candidates were calling up service personnel and threatening them. No other party has been given marked election rolls,” Chodankar said.
 
 He also said that the CEO’s office had leaked serial numbers of ballot papers to BJP.
