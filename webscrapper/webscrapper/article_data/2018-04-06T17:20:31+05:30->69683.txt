They were born and raised in   and poised for a career in the corporate world. But Sandalwood was where Adhvithi and Ashvithi Shetty found their calling. Having fetched attention as the ‘Ramachari twins’, the girls went on to subsequently star in other Kannada films. And now one among the Shetty twins is all set make her debut in  . 

  Considering herself fortunate to make this new foray, an elated Adhvithi shares that this indeed a dream debut in her mother tongue. “It is the perfect opportunity to connect with my roots. Although offers to do Tulu films have been coming my way, nothing compelled me to accept those projects. But when 
  (house warming) came my way, I found it interesting. It’s a comedy and I play an architect in it. All the top actors of Tulu, including Naveen Padil and Bhojaraj Vamanjoor, feature in it,” says Adhvithi. 
 
  Although she’s been part of Sandalwood, the actor has kept herself updated of the goings on in Tulu. “Entertainment is what the locals look for so comedy is a favourite genre. Besides, my sister and I have done Tulu theatre earlier including the popular play 
 . I’m excited about this new phase,” she signs off.
