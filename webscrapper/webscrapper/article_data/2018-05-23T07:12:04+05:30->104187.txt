BENGALURU: On May 24, 2008, when Phase I of the Kempegowda International Airport ( ) was thrown open for operations at Devanahalli, the sleepy village located about 30km from Bengaluru, it marked the start of a fresh chapter in the city’s history. Now, as it prepares to mark its 10th anniversary on Thursday, the airport has grown by leaps and bounds and   is much sought-after real estate.

 The terminal at the airport, which has the distinction of being one of the first in the country to be constructed through a public-private partnership, was designed to handle 20 million passengers per year. KIA has already witnessed a record 27 million passengers in 2017-18 alone — 30% more than capacity.
 
  
  
 Officials say to handle growing footfall, the design for a second terminal (T2) will be finalized soon. Phase 1 of is expected be completed by mid-2021. “Work on the second runway has begun and will be ready by September 2019,” said a BIAL spokesperson.
 
 Officials say that the combined capacity of T1 and T2 – once completely operational – will be about 65 million passengers per annum. “We have added more boarding gates and bus bays to create more physical infrastructure,” the official said. “This is an ongoing and time-consuming process. In the interim, in order to accommodate rapid growth in passenger traffic, we rely heavily on technology and use innovative methods to manage queues. This ensures a seamless passenger experience.”
 
 BIAL has introduced initiatives such as kiosk check-in facility and boarding pass printing machines in coordination with airlines for web check-in to deal with the flow of passengers. Self-service increases check in capacity as the manual counters are used only for bag drops.
 
 D  , president of the  , said: “Th e facilities are far better than airports maintained by Airports Authority of India. Bengaluru is also set to be the first Aadhaar-enabled airport which is another tech initiative of BIAL.”
