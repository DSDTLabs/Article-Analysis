THANE: This World Health Day we saw that the number of people suffering with depression has increased by 18% all across the globe. In order to have a healthy parent-child relationship, the Institute for Psychological Health (IPH) has been organising sereval workshops. 

 Speaking about new age parenting, Arun Naik, a psychologist from IPH said, “Parenting today is not as simple as it was before 90s. Easy access to internet has changed how children behaved then and now. Increased focus on getting good marks makes even the most lenient   hound their kids to study 24X7 and stay away from gadgets, which is not much appreciated by the kids. Less communication between parents and kids is also a reason for kids becoming aggressive.”
 
 “The counselling workshops in the last 22 years have seen a sea change. Parenting in the modern world needs to be emotion-centric. This makes the child feel confident, comfortable and safe. While parents need to be supportive, they should also be firm and maintain discipline,” Naik added. — Freny Fernandes
