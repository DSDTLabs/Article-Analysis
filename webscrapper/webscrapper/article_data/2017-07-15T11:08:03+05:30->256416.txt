 is something he has never done before, through the   film Kaattu.

 The actor plays an earthy character named   in the movie and its character reveal video is just out. Asif gives a handful of expression changes, from innocent happiness to sadness, as the character, who works in a toddy shop. With disheveled hair and tanned skin, he is almost unrecognizable in the character get up and has gotten under its skin.
 
  The film is based on a short story by Padmaraja. It has been written by his son, Anandapadmanabhan and the shoot kicked off in April.
