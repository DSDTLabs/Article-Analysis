KOCHI: The sight of an old worn out   painted in red and pale yellow colour maybe an eyesore for some. But for KSRTC, Ernakulam, it is truly turning out to be a money spinner as filmmakers are now hiring them to use it in their movies with an aim to take cine lovers down memory lane.

 Two   buses were hired for shooting in the district in 2016 while in 2015, four buses were hired for shooting. Most demand for low-floor AC buses.“KSRTC buses are hired for film shooting. The demand is for old style buses, but we don't have that now,“said T Shibu, general inspector in Ernakulam depot.
 
 Many films including `Ordinary' showcased KSRTC buses. At the climax of the film 'Jacobinte Swargarajyam', the hero states that to qualify as a Malayali one has to travel on a KSRTC bus. Considering private hiring, KSRTC buses have more admirers in silver screen than public in Ernakulam.
 
 KSRTC bus is given on hire for private needs for Rs 8,000 for 100km for five hours. The private party should pay 15% tax of the 40 per cent of the total rent amount for normal buses.The tariff for hiring KSRTC bus for private purpose is Rs 10,000 for 150 km for six hours and Rs 12,000 for 200km for eight hours.For film shooting the rent is Rs 20,000 plus service tax per day. Diesel will be filled from the depot and the service of KSRTC driver will also be provided.
 
 Production controller Harris Desom says, “KSRTC buses give a nostalgic feeling in movies and raises curiosity among viewers. Our preference is for small-sized KSRTC buses. But nowadays it is difficult to get such buses."
