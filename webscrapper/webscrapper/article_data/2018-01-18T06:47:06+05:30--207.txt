NEW DELHI: Three weeks after announcing additional market   of Rs 50,000 crore, the government slashed it by 60% to Rs 20,000 crore as it expects its revenue mop-up to be better than what was anticipated last month. 

  The announcement on Wednesday will comfort analysts, who were worried that the spike in borrowings will significantly push up the fiscal deficit beyond the budgeted level of 3.2% of  . The decision to restrict additional borrowings came after a review of the overall fiscal situation, which pointed to an improvement in the direct tax receipts and better-than-budgeted disinvestment mop-up. A prolonged economic slowdown had impacted corporation tax collections, while GST receipts have been falling due to repeated rate reductions and leakages as several concessions had been made for a smoother transition. 
 
 Besides, the government is trying to extract higher dividends from public sector companies, while prodding the   to transfer higher surplus to the government, something that the central bank has been resisting for the past few months. The government had in October sought transfer of Rs 13,000 crore surplus lying with the central bank. 
 
  In August, the RBI had transferred Rs 30,659 crore for the year-ended June 2017, compared to Rs 58,000 crore budgeted by the government. The surplus transfer was less than half of Rs 65,876 crore it had paid in 2015-16. On Wednesday, economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said the government has reassessed additional borrowing requirements taking note of revenue receipts and expenditure pattern.
