GURGAON: The state labour department has finally formed a   (CLAB), after the   warned the state   of action in case of any further delay in this regard. 

 “The board has been constituted with representatives from the industry and workers’ groups, along with government officials,” said a labour department official.
 
 The board, which came into being in November last year, is headed by labour minister Nayab Singh Saini as the chairman. Labour commissioner-cum-department secretary Pankaj Agarwal is also on the board. 
 
 A writ petition was filed by Gurgaon-based   (GAWU) in 2014 demanding formation of the board, pending for about 15 years despite repeated appeals.
 
 Hearing the plea, the court of Justice PB Bajanthri, on October 4 last year, had given the labour commissioner six weeks to form the board. Failing in which, Agarwal was to be liable to pay a sum of Rs 50,000, the court had warned.
 
 “The Contract Labour Advisory Board (CLAB) is the main authority at the state level that can ensure that the Contract Labour Act is not misused by employers to abuse workers. In the absence of the board, contractual workers in the state had been facing exploitation,” said  , one of the lawyers who worked on the petition. Also, the board needs to be consulted before making any change in government policies concerning contract workers.
 
 Members of the Garments and Allied Workers’ Union said in the absence of the board, employers were exploiting contract labourers, illegally terminating contracts of workers, denying them salary and other benefits. “The illegitimate use of contact labour allows employers to keep large numbers of workers under constant fear so that they do not complain,” said Amarnath Sharma, a member of GAWU.
