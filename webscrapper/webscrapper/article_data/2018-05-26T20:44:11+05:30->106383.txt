NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday asked the   to respond to a PIL alleging “rampant irregularities and illegalities” in the running of the National Zoological Park (NZP) in the city.

 The PIL alleged negligence in veterinary care being provided to the animals lodged in the   and suppression of deaths of protected species, prompting a bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice   to issue notice to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change as well as the   (CZA) and NZP.
 
 The court asked them to inform it of the action taken in connection with the issues raised in the plea by activist Gauri Maulekhi, who cited recent findings of CZA indicating death of a large number of animals from protected species, including langur and hog deer at Delhi zoo. 
 
 She alleged that there was a total breakdown in the administration at NZP, which was set up in 1959.
 
 According to the petition, CZA had also found that there was “suppression of the deaths through the submission of inaccurate inventory reports and fabricated postmortem reports”.
 
 The other instances of alleged irregularities included capture of animals like monitor lizards and small Indian civets from the wild and “illegally placing them in the zoo to cover up the large number of deaths”, the plea said.
 
 The authority had also found negligence in the medical care provided to the animals at the zoo. The plea has sought a direction to the ministry to establish an independent expert committee for oversight of the zoo as well as initiation of disciplinary and criminal action against all the erring staff working there.
 
 The petition has also sought that the CZA’s reports and findings be adopted and implemented.
