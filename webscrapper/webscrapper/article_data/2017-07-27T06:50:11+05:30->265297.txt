PUNE: As many as 128   on government land in Pune district that have violated lease   will have to pay a transfer fee at par with the market rate and a penalty, a government directive from the revenue department said. 

 Parvati area, with 61 such societies, tops the list, while Shivajinagar, old city areas, Erandwane, Yerawada and Ghorpadi are close behind.
 
 Over 150 acres of government land have been leased to various societies in the city. They will come under the scanner if they have added any construction or sold flats without the collector’s permission or violated any   norm.
 
 The checks began last November and 50 notices were issued. After e-mutation work began, the checks were stalled. The drive will intensify from mid-August in Pune district, revenue officials said.
 
 The recent order has modified norms about the transfer and sale of flats in cooperative housing societies on leased government land to allow regularization of unauthorized transactions.
 
 With land ownership vested in the government and the societies only allotted such land on lease or occupancy rights basis, the collector’s permission is required for a transfer, sale or gift of such flats. 
 
 The order issued by revenue official states that there are severe violations already. “ The collectorate has been told to accept proposals after scrutinizing each case and the government has also decided to recognize the irregular resale of apartments from such newly admitted members,’’ the official said.
 
 These plots were allotted for low-cost housing projects for government or army officials or for rehabilitation of project-affected or flood-affected families nearly 50-60 years ago. 
 
 “The penalty and charges levied would be huge. We have to wait for the implementation,’’ a government employee living in a society allotted on government land said.
