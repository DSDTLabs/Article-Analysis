GUWAHATI: A day after   chief minister   said the National Register of Citizens ( ) update process is a "conspiracy" against the Bengali-speaking people of the state, several complaints were filed against her with the city police on Thursday. 

 Addressing a public rally at   in West Bengal's Birbhum district, Mamata had on Wednesday said the NRC update process is a re-run of the anti-foreigner movement of the 1980s and aims at driving out 1.8 crore people from the state. 
 
 "Bengalis are being driven out of Assam. It will have an impact in West Bengal because Bengal is on  's border. We can't stay on as mere onlookers. I warn BJP not to play with fire. We will not spare them if people are under attack," she had said.
 
 Assam reacted with strong protests against the statement. In an FIR with Latasil Police, Tailendra Nath Das, an advocate, said the chief minister's speech contained inflammatory material that may promote enmity between different groups living in Assam on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc. "Thereby, she has committed an offence of 'hate speech' under section 153 (A) of the IPC," Das said in the FIR. 
 
 The complainant was backed by several other Gauhati high court lawyers practising in the high court. Advocate Bijon Mahajan said the speech was also in contempt of the Supreme Court, under whose supervision the NRC update process is being done.
 
 A separate FIR was also filed with the police by a city resident   on the same grounds, demanding police action against her. 
 
 The first draft of the updated NRC was published at midnight on Sunday, in which 1.9 crore names figured out of 3.29 crore applicants.
