SALIGAO: A group of residents of the coastal village of   gathered at the panchayat on Friday to submit a memorandum to the sarpanch and panch members in connection with their demand that the North Goa Planning and Development Authority ( ) be scrapped.

 The absence of Candolim sarpanch Slavador Blaise Fernandes and panch members at the panchayat office infuriated the villagers, who said it was a deliberate attempt to avoid them. 
 
 Around 35 residents signed the memorandum, which is also going to be forwarded to the   minister and the NGPDA chairman. In it, the villagers stated they were aggrieved with the authority of the NGPDA over Candolim and also the draft outline development plan (ODP).
 
 “Urgent efforts should be made by the panchayat to strengthen the village development committee and prepare the village development plan with due discussion and approval from the gram sabha,” the memorandum stated.
 
 “We want development, but not at the cost of destroying our hills and fields,” Regina Ferandes, a resident, said.
