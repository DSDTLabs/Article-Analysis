PANAJI: With a 220% jump in allocation, the state’s industrial sector, especially the estates, which are struggling with infrastructural woes, could get a much-needed fillip. 

 The allocation in the budget indicates that along with development of industrial estates and financial incentives for entrepreneurs, new estates or expansion of existing ones could also be on the cards.
 
 Chief minister   has provided Rs 150.4 crore in 2018-19 for the department of industries, trade and commerce as against the Rs 47 crore allocated in 2017-18. Given that the   ( ) is running short of industrial plots, Parrikar, who holds the   portfolio, has also kept aside Rs 7 crore for land acquisition for new estates and phase II expansion.
 
 Revenue expenditure on industrial estates has also gone up from Rs 24.7 crore to Rs 61.6 crore, a 150% increase since last year. Revenue expenditure on the department of industry, trade and commerce has also gone up from Rs 42.5 crore to Rs 90.3 crore.
 
 Goa’s local business community had urged Parrikar to provide the necessary impetus to industrial development by upgrading the 24 industrial estates. 
 
 “The major recommendation is for investment into the GIDC through grants so that infrastructure in industrial estates can be improved,” Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry president   had told TOI before the Budget.
 
 The chief minister has also provided a capital outlay of Rs 50 crore for the GIDC, a first since 2016. 
 
 A whopping jump of 11,460% in capital outlay under the budget head of other expenditure is seen with the allocation shooting from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 57.8 crore. 
 
 No explanation has been provided for these funds, but they could be utilized for schemes and incentives that Parrikar could announce in the coming months.
