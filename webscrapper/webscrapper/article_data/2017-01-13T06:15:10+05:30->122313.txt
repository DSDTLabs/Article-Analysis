MUMBAI:   on Thursday instructed party functionaries to be ready to contest the upcoming BMC elections on its own steam, even as a large number of BJP activists in Mumbai, Thane and Pune have begun to mount pressure on the party not to have any truck with the Sena.

 Thackeray held a meeting with vibhag pramukhs at Matoshree earlier in the day . He reviewed the pre-poll scenario and discussed the possibility of the Sena going solo for the BMC elections, sources said. “We are ready to contest all 227 BMC seats on our own strength, if need arises,“ said vibhag pramukh   of the Sena.
 
 Although the BJP has formally invited Sena for talks, Matoshree is growing suspicious of the BJP's hemming and hawing on hammering out a formula for the distribution of seats, a knotty issue in view of the Sena's reluctance to offer more seats to its ally .The BJP has been asking for 114 seats, while the Sena is not willing to part with more than 105.
 
 Sena leaders Subhash Desai and   met BJP leaders Ashish Shelar, Vinod Tawde and   on Wednesday . However, BJP is yet to submit a formal proposal to Sena on its seat demand.
 
 “Talks can't move ahead until BJP brings up its list of seats. However, there hasn't been a word from them on this,“ said a key Sena functionary .
