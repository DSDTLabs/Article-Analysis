GURUGRAM: Apart from legal hurdles, the   flyover-underpass project has been delayed because the National Highways Authority of India ( ) is not getting the land it needs for construction of foot overbridges (FOBs) and service roads, although it deposited the compensation for the land last month. 

 The land has not been acquired as the money has not been distributed to land owners yet by the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), NHAI officials said.
 
 The project includes the construction of three flyovers and an underpass passing through Iffco Chowk. It is 97% complete, officials said. Saurabh Singhal, team leader and traffic transportation expert at Bloom Companies, the consultant for the project, said: “NHAI needs land to construct a couple of service roads, FOBs and drains at Signature Tower and Iffco Chowk.”
 
 At Signature Tower, approximately 1,210 square yards of land is required for the construction of a service road and drain at Sector 29 junction, while NHAI needs an additional 605 square yards of land to build a service road, FOB and sewer line on the opposite side (towards Jaipur).
 
 Similarly, apart from the petrol pump hurdle, the construction of a drain, service road and sewer line is pending at Iffco Chowk due to delay in acquisition of nearly 3,630 square yards of land.
 
 NHAI submitted Rs 71 crore as compensation to be awarded to the land owners on February 22. In a letter to the SDM on February 26, NHAI said, “You are requested to start releasing the compensation amount to the land owners...You are also requested to hand over possession of land to NHAI as soon as possible.” However, that hasn’t been done so far.
 
 Speaking to TOI, SDM (north Gurugram) Bharat Bhushan said: “We received payment. Owners have to approach us for compensation. The procedure is simple, the person whose land is being taken has to apply and then we will give the amount after verification of the documents.”
