Nagpur: Considering the increasing number of   deaths, the public health department in Maharashtra is planning to set up 280 incubators and three neonatal intensive care units (NICs) in the state. The three NICUs include two in Vidarbha, one each at Chandrapur and Amravati and one in Nashik.

 “Majority of the prenatal deaths in state and region are due to the premature and underweight babies born to mothers who are themselves anaemic. Most of the underweight children don’t survive. But these are put in the category of children’s death and wrongly projected in the media,” said state public health minister Deepak Sawant on Thursday.
 
 Sawant was in city for a review meeting of the situation in the region. He claimed that the infant mortality rate had relatively gone down in Melghat. The health department after studying the death audit of Melghat has involved the village sarpanch, the Asha workers and the police Patil of the village. “We are trying to bring down the IMR from 21 to 18 in the state. Nagpur Obstetric and Gynaecological Society and the Indian Academy of Paediatrics was also helping in this,” said Sawant.
 
 On swine flu incidence, Sawant said that the infection had claimed 521 lives in state and 58 in Nagpur since January this year. The 58 deaths include 19 deaths in Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and 39 deaths in private hospitals. At present seven swine flu patients are on ventilator. The department has asked the various corporations to make the vaccine available in all cities. “The vaccination keeps the immunity against the virus for at least nine months. There is no chance of the H1N1 virus mutating soon,” said Sawant.
 
 Talking about his visit to the RST Cancer Hospital and the Daga Hospital, Sawant said that the government had allocated Rs50 crore to the cancer hospital. “The government was working on increasing the beds in the Daga hospital,” he said.
