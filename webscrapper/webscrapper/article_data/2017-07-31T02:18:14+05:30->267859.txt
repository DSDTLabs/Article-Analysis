THANE: A vigilant   helped   three thieves who were about to rob valuables from the workshop of an automobile company on Saturday evening at Kapurbawadi.

 The watchman, Zakir Hussain (21) was appointed as one of the security guards at the workshop over a month ago. He and three other guards were doing their duty on Saturday evening when three robbers tried to steal valuables from the workshop.
 
 “Hussain was on duty on the workshop’s main gate when he saw that three men jumped over the gate and entered the premises. He immediately went ahead to stop them when he noticed that one of the accused, Omkar Thakre, was an ex-employee and was employed as a   there. He warned the   to step back, but they started hitting him. When another guard reached the spot to stop them they attacked him too. Hussain then immediately alerted the other guards who were staying in the premises and asked them to alert the Kapurbawadi police about the incident. The police then reached the spot and nabbed Thakre, Sagar Gaikwad (22) and Prashant Divekar (28).
 
 The police claimed that Thakre was fired from the job as he would not do his duty properly. This had made him angry and he planned to take revenge by robbing computers and other valuables from the workshop.
