PUNE: As the city awaits pre-monsoon showers, India Meteorological Department ( ) data has revealed that May 2018 has been the driest for Pune over the last five years.

 During the past years, May had often recorded thunderstorm activity coupled with rain that would also help reduce the summer temperature. This year, however, pre-monsoon rains have evaded Pune, even in May, when most pre-monsoon activity occurs here. The city’s rain total this May has been 3.7mm, lowest since 2014.
 
 The city had received only one actual shower this May a few weeks ago with some thunderstorm activity. Ever since, even as the skies have been cloudy on and off there has been no rain.
 
 AK Srivastava, the head of climate monitoring and analysis group at IMD told TOI that for a persistent period in April and May this year, there was an anti-cyclone over the Arabian Sea that was preventing moisture from coming to the land region. “All air was moving from land to sea instead of coming from the sea to land due to the anti-cyclone. The anti-cyclone was quite westward, which was preventing all the moist air from reaching the land region,” explained Srivastava.
 
 Meteorologist and   founder   said that premonsoon rain this season has been less than normal over all of  . “The rain occurs due to thunderstorm activity, not any particular weather system. Thunderstorm activity is dependent on moisture incursion from the sea. However, most of the summer season this year had less humidity, due to a lack of moist air coming from the Arabian Sea,” he said.
 
 Another met weather department official said that pre-monsoon rains have reduced in several parts of the state over the years.
 
 Pre-monsoon rain from March 1 to May 23 was also deficient by 50% for  , 43% for  , and 56% for Vidarbha.
