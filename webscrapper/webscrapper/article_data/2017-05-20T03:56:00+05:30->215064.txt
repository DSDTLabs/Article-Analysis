THANE: A 42-year-old homemaker in Thane’s Wagle Estate has been duped of Rs 72,000 after a caller posing as a bank executive acquired her account details recently. 

 The homemaker’s 20-year-old daughter received a call on April 21 from an unknown person, asking for her mother’s bank account information. 
 
 “The youngster and her mother had recently applied for online banking access. The caller said that in order to process it, he would require some details. The conman tricked the girl into disclosing her mother’s ATM card number and CVV number,” said S R Londhe, sub-inspector of Shreenagar   station. 
 
 Later, seven transactions to the tune of Rs 72,895 were made from the account. The daughter lodged a complaint on Wednesday at Shreenagar police station. “We have been trying to trace the conman’s mobile number,” said Londhe.
