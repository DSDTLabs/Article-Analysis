Post the URI attacks the stress between the two countries was quite visible. From stopping talent across border to perform in India to banning Indian films in  , both the countries showed equal hatred towards each other.

 But ‘Kaabil’ seems to be toning down the situation here. Pakistan has issued a No Objection Certificate for ‘Kaabil’, which is now set to release in the country this weekend after a four-month-long ban by government on the screening of Indian movies, following Indo-Pak tensions.
 
 An official of Hum Films told PTI that they were still awaiting NOC for the Shahrukh Khan-Mahira Khan starrer ‘Raees’ which would also be released soon.
 The NOC for ‘Kaabil’ was issued by the government on the recommendation of the committee formed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to look into the screening of Indian films locally, which had submitted a report to the Prime Minister’s secretariat this week.
 
 The committee headed by Minister of State for Information Maryam Aurangzeb had in its recommendations advised that the old policy that was in place before the screening of Indian films was suspended in the country should be maintained. The suspension of the screenings of Indian films came after several Bollywood producers banned casting Pakistani artists in Indian movies in the wake of Uri terror attack and ‘surgical strikes’ conducted by the Indian Army on terror launch pads along the LOC in Kashmir.
