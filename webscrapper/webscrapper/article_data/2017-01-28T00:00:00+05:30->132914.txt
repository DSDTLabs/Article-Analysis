Commemorating the 100th day of JNU student   Ahmed’s mysterious disappearance, students of UoH organised a peaceful protest on Thursday. Their aim was to stand in solidarity with Najeeb and his family.
Dontha Prashanth, one of the five students who were expelled from the hostel along with  , for allegedly assaulting an   student leader on campus, said, “What’s the point of 
 celebrating   if voices of people of the nation are unheard; the voice of Fatima Nafees (Najeeb’s mother) is unheard; the voice of Radhika Vemula (Rohith’s mother) is unheard; the voice of hundreds of students who face institutional discrimination remain unheard. What’s the point of celebrating democracy if laws are disrespected, bent to suit the needs of people in power, criminals are never punished and justice is never meted out to the victims?”
 Seshaiah Chemudagunta, 
 another among the five expelled students asserted, “It’s been 100 days since Najeeb disappeared from JNU. Another missing case that’s being talked about on social media is that of Babita Singh, a former student of UoH, who wrote a painful mail to her brother wring about the constant humiliation and harassment she had to face in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.”
 Tahir Jamal, a PhD scholar from the varsity, said, “While writing the posters, ‘Ya toh Najeeb aayega ya fir inquilab aayega’, I didn’t have faith, or hope, in the words I was writing. Mujhe pata hai kuch nahi hone wala hai. Because I have seen many such cases, none of the victims have received justice yet. Those cases are painful reminders on Republic day.”
