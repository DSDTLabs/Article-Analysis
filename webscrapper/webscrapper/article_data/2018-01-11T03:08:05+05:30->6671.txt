NEW DELHI: Following the arrest of a Jet Airways air hostess,   agencies said that now airline   will be under   with each bag   before they are allowed to board a flight.

 “There is greater vigilance and focus now on   crew members and staff after the incident. Bags are being checked thoroughly, both through the screening process and physical check. Since they have a separate entry process, security has been stepped up,” said an airport official.
 
 Sources said security officials have been asked to step up their focus on airline members in particular. Officials have been told to check both their hand baggage and the registered baggage before they are allowed to board a flight.
 
 Senior CISF officials told TOI that no change will take place in the screening process, however extra attention will be paid to the hand baggage. “Initially, the passenger and the hand baggage are checked by us and personnel have been asked to be vigilant of not just weapons but also drugs and foreign currency,” said a senior official.
