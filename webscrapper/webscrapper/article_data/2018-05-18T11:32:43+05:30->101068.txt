LUCKNOW: According to experts, the two major factors responsible for the decline of   are financial crunch and shortage of teachers.

 
 Principals of affiliated colleges say that meritorious students prefer Delhi University or institutes abroad because bigger cities offer better and more job opportunities.
 
 “Lucknow University has lost its stronghold in academia as several teaching posts are lying vacant for years, leading to a fall in the quality of education,” said vice-chancellor Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University Manoj Dixit, who has taught in LU for more than 25 years.
 
 Further, he said, the university focused more on self-financed courses over the past two decades, ignoring its regular courses due to which the latter lost sheen. The system after the 1990s was more administrative-centric instead of being student-centric. Financial crunch and failure to upgrade syllabus and infrastructure according to modern-day requirements were also reasons for the decline, he added.
 
 Mukesh Kumar Pati, principal of the 156-year-old Lucknow  , believes that it is not the university’s education quality that has deteriorated but student preferences have shifted to bigger cities and abroad.
 
 “LU or its colleges have lost preference of students because they look for greener pastures. For this, they are ready to leave their hometown and even the country,” he said.
 
 Vinita Prakash, principal of the 132-year-old Isabella  , said that the state capital does not have much to offer to students. “Students are vying for professional courses over regular graduation in India and abroad. Most prefer Delhi as it offers more opportunities. Lucknow does not have many job prospects for students and that is a reason why students move out of the city.”
