PANAJI: Calling it a ‘cardinal sin’, the   (AAP) on Sunday evening withdrew its support to Govind Gawde, who is fighting as an independent from the   after he accepted support from the   (BJP).

 “We are withdrawing our support to Govind Gawde with immediate effect as he has chose to accept it from BJP. To stand on the same pedestal with the BJP is a cardinal sin that Gawde committed. It is important to oust   from Priol, but not at the cost of bringing BJP through the back door,” AAP’s spokesperson Oscar Rebelo told TOI, adding that he expects that Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and BJP are likely to come together post elections.
 
 “The BJP will do anything to stay in power. If needed, they will even go for an alliance with the Congress,” Rebelo said, adding that following the withdrawal of support, the party will now be fielding its own candidate in Priol.
 
 State unit president, BJP, Vinay Tendulkar, while addressing mediapersons in Ponda, said that BJP has extended its support to Gawde to prevent division of votes which could enable the MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar alias Deepak to retain the Priol seat.
