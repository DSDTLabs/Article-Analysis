Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has taken cognisance of the issue of collection of money by private hospitals from patients and not providing them treatment under the chief minister health insurance scheme. It then directed the state’s health secretary to file a comprehensive report regarding the implementation of the state and district-level monitoring committees constituted under the scheme.

 K K Ramesh from Madurai filed a contempt plea. The division bench of justices K K Sasidharan and G R Swaminathan heard it. The petitioner said that many private hospitals collect money from patients who approached there under the chief minister comprehensive health insurance scheme of Tamil Nadu (CMCHISTN), which is against the scheme. There is no mechanism for patients to ventilate their grievance and get it redressed. When the issue was taken to the notice of the high court bench by way of filing a petition, the court directed the government to consider the issue. Even thereafter, the government did not look into the issue.
 
 “I also filed an additional typeset saying how a private hospital in Madurai collected money from a patient admitted under the health insurance scheme. But, the authorities remained silent,” he said. The special government pleader told that the government has constituted state-level and district-level monitoring committees.
 
 The bench said that the media report also revealed that a private hospital refused to give treatment to a policewoman who sought treatment under the health insurance scheme. “Is there any mechanism to monitor such issues?” the bench asked and said, “The health secretary is directed to file a comprehensive report about the implementation such monitoring committees.”
