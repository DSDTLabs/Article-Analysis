MUMBAI: Alert passengers and an   (RPF) cop managed to avert a senior citizen’s suicide in front of a running   at   station on Monday afternoon.

 Sudharashan Maheshwaram (70), who was formerly employed in a mill and then hired as a cook by a caterer in Mumbai, had shifted base to   after suffering a paralytic stroke two years ago. On Sunday, he boarded a train from Hyderabad for Dadar on the pretext of checking on his locked room in a chawl in Bhoiwada, Parel. He reached Dadar on Monday. 
 
 A senior RPF official said, “The incident took place on the CSMT-bound fast tracks at Dadar off platform six. There was shock and commotion as soon as the crowds on platforms five and six spotted him lying on the tracks just as a Kasara-CSMT fast local was pulling into platform six.” Maheshwaram was lying on the tracks a little distance away.
 
 Constable Diwan Singh, who was on platform six, spotted him too. The cop and the crowd raised an alarm as the train restarted after the scheduled halt. Fortunately, the motorman heard the cries and managed to stop the train just metres away from the man.
 
 The RPF staff immediately got down on the tracks to convince him to get up. Maheshwara told cops that he had boarded Hyderabad Deccan Express for Dadar to kill himself over some “domestic issues”.
 
 The cops counselled him and got in touch with his son in Hyderabad. “We asked his son to WhatsApp details of his medicines. He was given refreshments before being taken to the emergency medical room.”
