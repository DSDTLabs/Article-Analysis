COIMBATORE: The Tirupur rural police have decided to take action against Avinashi crime   inspector Ranjith for posting an   against a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) on his  

 The post said, “I had gone to meet the additional deputy superintendent of police at the office of the superintendent of police in TIrupur on Wednesday morning. He was discussing about a theft case with the ADSP. Meanwhile, Palladam sub-division DSP came there and sat in a chair near to him. Later, Avinashi DSP Paramasamy came there and sat behind him. But I did not notice him and started to discuss with ADSP about the case. However, I was badly rebuked by Avinashi DSP for not saluting him. I did not see him as he was sitting behind me. The DSP has issued more than 60 memos and is trying to take revenge against me. Senior officers are also supporting him.”
 
 Ranjith told TOI that he attempted to meet the superintendent of police ES Uma to lodge a complaint against Avinashi DSP. But the SP was not ready to accept the petition. “I know a lot of things about the DSP. So, he wants to take revenge. Senior officers again will take action against me. I want justice,” said Ranjith.
 
 Meanwhile, Uma told TOI that there was an argument between the DSP and inspector and the matter will be inquired by a special officer. “The petition on   violates the police rule. Departmental action would be taken against him,” she added.
