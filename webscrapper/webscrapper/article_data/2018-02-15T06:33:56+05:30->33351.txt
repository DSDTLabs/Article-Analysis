AHMEDABAD: Runway maintenance at   (SVPI) Airport, Ahmedabad will once again be taken up, in two phases. The first phase is from Friday onwards to February 28. The second phase, involving  , will begin on March 1 and end on April 15. During the second phase, flight operations will be suspended from 10am to 7pm.

  
  Flights operating during the day will be rescheduled to fit into peak flying hours in the morning and evening. Airport authorities have taken a series of measures to cope with the passenger rush and keep inconvenience to flyers at a minimum.
 
 “The domestic terminal – Terminal-1 – will have 13 new self-check-in counters, to keep the check-in process smooth. Passengers without check-in baggage can collect their boarding passes from these counters and head to the security check,” said Manoj Gangal, director of SVPI Airport.
 
 As more passengers will be at the city airport simultaneously, augmented seating arrangements and washroom facilities have been created. “More washrooms will be developed at the arrival terminals. To cope with passenger rush, we have also upgraded seating capacity from 288 seats to 450, so flyers are comfortable,” Gangal added.
 
 Most international flights operate at night or early morning and hence international traffic has not been affected. This is the third time since 2016 that the airport runway is repaired, after the 3.5km long runway was upgraded in October 2016 and after the monsoon damaged patches of the runway in 2017.
 
 “Regular maintenance of the runway must be undertaken to ensure safety of aircraft flying out of the airport and arriving here,” said the airport director.
