NEW DELHI: More than the subsidy of Rs 30,000,   in the city want better regulation and a   for them from the Delhi government, which they hope, will save them from prosecution.

 “Transport minister   has acknowledged that we provide an environment-friendly mode of last-mile connectivity to and from metro stations. However, most Metro stations are located next to arterial roads where we are not allowed to ply,” said Anurag Pandy, an e-rickshaw owner. Pandey was among the thousands of owners and drivers who had come to a government function to receive of payment of subsidy on Saturday.
 
 “We want the government to de-notify the roads near Metro stations so that we are not penalised for illegal operation of e-rickshaws on those stretches,” Pandey said. “How can we ferry passengers to and from Metro stations if we are not allowed to go near them?” 
 
 Many feel there should be better regulation and infrastructure for these vehicles. “We are blamed for creating chaos and congestion near Metro stations but what can we do when there are no parking bays for us at these places,” asked  , another e-rickshaw owner. “There should be a comprehensive policy on operation of e-rickshaws, especially when the government seems so keen on eco-friendly transport.” 
 
 Some of the owners claim they are at the mercy of traffic police and face rampant prosecution. “There should be rules that allow us to work within a legal framework. Recently, my vehicle was impounded and I had to pay a huge fine,” said Vinod Kumar, a owner. “The government should do something about the harassment we face daily. Just providing a one-time subsidy wouldn’t help us.” 
 
 The number of e-rickshaws in the city has seen a phenomenal growth in the past couple of years. The transport department itself doesn’t know their exact number but peg it at more than one lakh. The number of these vehicles registered with the department is around 33,000.
