The demands for adequate infrastructure for pedestrians rang out loud and clear at the forum as citizens highlighted the dangers of walking. Footpaths, they say, are in poor condition and in many areas there is a lack of space to walk. It poses a barrier to those wanting to walk rather than commute by vehicles.

 Kishori Mudaliar, a resident and member of  , an association of 8,000 to 9,000 residents, said she and fellow residents have been fighting for rights of pedestrians for ages.
 
 “It has reached a point where people are dying because of inadequate infrastructure for pedestrians,” Kishori said. “Recently, two people were killed in accidents right opposite   lake. The BBMP seems to only operate on a profit making basis. No new road projects should be sanctioned or the completion certificate should not be handed over till rights of pedestrian have been accommodated. There needs to be a change in mindset where engineers are trained not to view skywalks as money-making enterprises.”
 
 R Sadasivam, a resident of  , concurred with Kishori and also pointed out that there appears a total lack of inter-agency coordination in the city. “Between the Hegdenagar and Hennur flyover, the BWSSB has dug up everything," he said. "It has restricted citizens’ movement and we can’t even go to the shops that we want.”
 
 Shreyas Ramesh, a resident of K Narayanapura and student of MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology, commented on the type of roads and the quality provided by contractors.
 
 “The Hennur-Bagalur road is pathetic,” he said. “Every three months, they dig it up. There is no coordination between the agencies.”
 
 Kavitha Reddy, a lake activist and resident of Bommanahalli, said that lack of regular cleaning of drains was resulting in flooding during monsoons. “First of all citizens are not aware of what a primary, secondary or tertiary drain is,” she said. “Drains should be clearly identified and should be periodically cleaned. This wasn’t done last year and the area was flooded during rains.”
 
 Some solutions
 
 • A ward-level platform where pressing issues are put to vote
 
 • Put in public domain tax collection and expenditure for each ward during elections
 
 • No new licences for buildings to be constructed within 20km radius of Vidhana Soudha
 
 • More dustbins on main roads. All food joints should compulsorily have two dustbins to dispose both types of waste
