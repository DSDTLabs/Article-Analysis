MUMBAI: The first day of the   exam had a lot to do with timing. For one, Mumbai divisional board did not allow nine students to write the paper as they reached beyond 11.20 am, a student enrolled for the   just in the nick of time — two hours before it began. Also, students said they had too little time to finish the English paper and Pune board officials struggled with time, trying to find out how photos of the paper had gone viral an hour after the exam had begun.

 This year, the board had asked students to enter exam halls no later than 11 am. “We had authorized in-charge at centres to allow students in up to 11.10 am if they believed the reason for delay was genuine. Between 11.10 and 11.20 am, the board let six students in. They were allowed to take the exam after their phones were scanned for any exam-related material and an undertaking taken. But students who came after that cited “traffic” or “difficulty in locating the centre” as reasons for delay and so we did not allow them,” said  , in-charge secretary of the board’s Mumbai division.
 
 
  
 
 Board officials on Wednesday morning completed enrolment process for private candidate,   within two hours and let him take the exam near its centre. As many as 26 students registered for the exam a day before.
 
 Officials said the exam was held without major glitches in Mumbai region. However, in Pune region officials had information that the paper had gone viral from Solapur. This was refuted by the local education officer.
 
 Students said the paper was “lengthy”. “I could not attempt questions worth 15 marks. My friends had similar trouble,” said a student of ICLS Junior College, Vashi. (inputs by  )
