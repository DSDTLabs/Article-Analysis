PATNA: In a setback to the state government, the Supreme Court on Friday dismissed its petition filed against the Patna high court order that the state legislature had no competence to make law with regard to manufacturing and export of extraneutral alcohol (ENA), rectified spirit or any other variety of industrial grade alcohol in the state.

 Advocate Satyabir Bharti, who appeared before the division bench of Justice R F Nariman and Justice Navin Singh in Delhi, told TOI that the bench also dismissed the state’s appeal to transfer the contempt petitions filed before the high court in the ENA case to the apex court.
 
 “The bench also dismissed another appeal of the state urging for transfer of the petitions filed by three homeopathic laboratories and a doctor against decision of production and sale of homeopathic medicine in state from the high court to the Supreme Court,” he said.
 
 Bharti, who represented four distilleries in Bihar producing ENA, said the state government had barred them from producing ENA from April 1, 2017 citing prohibition enforced on April 5, 2016. Thus production and sales of homeopathic medicines were also banned.
