Singer   has turned music director for an as-yet-untitled film, which will be directed by   of   fame. This film stars   in the lead, while the rest of the cast for this multilingual film is yet to be decided. Vijay had donned the hat of music director first for Andar Bahar. “After Andar Bahar, there were many offers for me to work as a composer, but I realized that music direction requires a completely different mindset, timings and an entirely different direction. Having said that, I enjoyed the experience of working for Andar Bahar, but I didn’t take up any more projects as I realized I wasn’t cut out for it at that point and I was busy singing,” says Vijay.

 He adds, “Even now, I have taken up this project only to keep up my word that I had given Phaneesh when we had done Andar Bahar. He had already discussed this film’s script and had insisted that I compose the music for this film. I still enjoy singing and I like singing for other music composers, but since this was decided five years ago, I am keeping my word and am just doing it. At this point, I don’t want to take up any other projects as a composer, but this film will see me work with all my heart, because it has a beautiful story. It is also because Phaneesh was the first to approach me to be a  , and I wanted to be in his second film as well.” Composing music for the film is going to be underway and the team aims to go on floors with the shoot around April-end or in the beginning of May.
