Model Chrissy   says she is so unimpressed by some of the movies she has seen lately that she feels she could try her hand at acting.

 "Okay movies s**k. I'm ready to be a very famous actress now. Please send me all the scripts," Teigen tweeted, reports femalefirst.co.uk.
 
 "Please note I cannot cry on cue but I am very good at happy, angry, tired, bitchy, super nice gal but complete indifference is my strength. I will do sexy time scenes it doesn't have to make sense," she added.
 
 
  
 
 Teigen is currently pregnant with her second child.
