Presidents of two national parties, for the first time ever, have hit the campaign trail in  , covering the entire state and underlining how important the May 12 elections are for their organizations. 

    chief Rahul Gandhi and   president   are on the verge of covering all the 30 districts of the state, reports  . Both have broken several stereotypes associated with their parties' leadership, but also have tripped more than once and faced embarrassments. But the two leaders have shrugged off the controversies and returned to campaign with vengeance in what is the most unpredictable poll battle ever in Karnataka's history. 
 
  The AICC president is said to have travelled over 3,500km while touring 30 districts. He visited around two dozen temples and mutts and even participated in a roadshow on the 400-km stretch between Ballari and   in severe heat.
