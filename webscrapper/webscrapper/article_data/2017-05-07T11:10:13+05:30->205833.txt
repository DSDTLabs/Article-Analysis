PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: There is a ray of hope for tur farmers who are in distress over falling prices and rising stockpiles. 

 Instead of expressing support merely through words, netizens have come together in a novel way. Social media users are organizing a ‘Tur Mahotsav’ wherein tur dal will be purchased from farmers at minimum support price (MSP) and sold to urban residents at Rs80 per kg.
 
 Over-production of tur has hit the farmers hard as the government has stopped purchasing it from them, while traders are buying it for much lower than MSP. As a result, lakhs of tonnes are lying unused. 
 
 A group of social media users, ‘Shetkari Sanman Parishad’, will organise the ‘mahotsav’ at Indrayaninagar in   on May 7. Residents of   will be able to purchase tur at the event, which will be held from 10am to 7pm on an open plot of land near   society, Sector 7, Tiruptai chowk.
 
 Elaborating on the concept, Mohsin  , a graphic designer from Bhum in  , said, “Farmers in the state have produced the highest quantity of tur this year, after the government appealed to them to grow more tur to scale down on imports. But when the state government stopped purchasing tur on April 22, copious amounts of tur remain unsold. Traders are taking advantage of the situation, and puchase tur at Rs2,800 per quintal, causing a loss of Rs 2,250 per quintal,” said Shaikh, currently a resident of Warje Malwadi.
 
 Shaikh joined hands with like-minded people — Imran Shaikh, Naseer Shaikh, Sachin Kumbhar, Suraj Mote and others — to help the distraught farmers. “We will hold similar mahotsavs in Chinchwad, Mumbai and Pune next week. People from other cities too have enquired about holding similar mahotsavs. Many farmers have contacted us to be on board,” he added.
