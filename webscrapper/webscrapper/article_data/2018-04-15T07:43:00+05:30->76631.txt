DERA BABA NANAK: On Baisakhi, hundreds of Sikhs who wish to walk 4kms to   in Pakistan from   in India, staged a hunger strike on the international border to press the demand. 
 
 Reciting the Japji Sahib, the peaceful protesters were joined by many others at Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district to have a glimpse of gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Narowal district of Pakistan.
 
 B S Goraya, president of  , an organisation that has been pursuing the cause of construction of the corridor since 2001, told TOI that 17 years ago on April 13, 2001, they began the movement to enable Sikhs to walk up to Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib and return the same day. 
 
 “We have achieved a lot since then. I will say we are victorious in our mission. We have successfully created a buzz in both countries and people are not only dreaming about the corridor but the Pakistan government has also made verbal offers for its construction,” said Goraya.
 
 Guru Nanak Dev reached Kartarpur Sahib after completing four journeys in 1522 and lived a simple life, working in his fields for nearly 17 years. Later, a gurdwara was constructed at  . During Partition, the gurdwara went to the Pakistan side.
 
 A Sikh devotee from Amritsar, Ravinder Singh, said, “I have been coming here every Baisakhi for the past more than eight years to pay obeisance at gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib from the international border. If the corridor is constructed, it would fulfil one of the Sikhs’ major demands as well as a religious aspiration.”
