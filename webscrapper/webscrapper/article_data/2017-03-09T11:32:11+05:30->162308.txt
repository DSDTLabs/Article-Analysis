PUNE: The   board ( ) has failed to operationalize its much-hyped dialysis unit claiming there is a lack of specialized staff needed to run the centre.

 The dialysis unit at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment   was scheduled to be operationalized on January 26. 
 
 The unit is aimed at converting the hospital into a super-speciality facility over the next year. This would be a cheaper and less-crowded alternative to the Sassoon hospital which has long waiting lists, and private hospitals that most cannot afford due to a lack of resources and health insurance.
 
 In its initial assessment, the board found that the unit required a nephrologist and highly trained and experienced technicians. PCB then outsourced the operations to external agencies and floated the first tender in December 2016. As many as three tenders were initiated for the same.
 
 However, the only qualifying bid found by the board officials was rejected by the general board citing insufficient specifications in the tender and bid documents.
 
 “There were problems in the issued documents. There were no specifications about the qualifications of the staff required, or how patients would be selected for dialysis. Also, the bidder had not filed adequate documents. So we had no option but to scrap the tender,” said a senior PCB official.
 
 While a re-tendering is in order with a few amendments stipulating more terms and conditions, it is not clear as to when the unit would begin operations.
