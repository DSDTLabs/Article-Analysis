Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS) will be organising a month-long campaign ‘Jawab do Andolan’ to question the central and state government over their political stand on the murder cases of   Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and M M Kalburgi. The campaign will begin from July 20 and will culminate on August 20. During the campaign, MANS members will meet the MLAs, MPs and MLCs from their respective districts.

 Avinash Patil, executive president of MANS said, though arrests have been made, but the government has not taken any action against the organisation for which those “culprits” worked. Neither Prime Minister   not chief minister   have spoken against it. 
 
 Along with this we will also organise series of programmes throughout the state like congregation of college youths, awareness about scientific and rational way of thinking among school children and series of essay competitions, he said.
