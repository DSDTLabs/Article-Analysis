Coimbatore: A team of forest department officials worked tirelessly to give medical care to an ailing wild elephant that was found near Narasipuram on Monday. The 50-year-old animal, which regained strength thanks to the treatment, returned to the forest later.

 Local residents had found the elephant lying near the outskirts of the forest on Sunday night. They immediately informed the officials. The officials brought a local veterinarian to take care of the animal, district forest officer S Venkatesh said. “The elephant was provided with food and fluids. We tried to revive it throughout the night. In the morning, forest department veterinarian Manoharan also reached the spot and continued the treatment,” he told TOI.
 
 Earthmovers were brought to the place to clear bushes in the area and to ensure that the elephant did not fall into deep pits there. By afternoon, the animal regained strength and stood up. It went in to the forest after some time.
 
 “It must have suffered some stomach infection due to old age,” Venkatesh added.
