 Chandigarh police officials say that the department had changed the strategy and was effectively issuing more challans that could act as a deterrent to the violators and help in saving precious lives in road accidents.
 
 The high court had recently directed the Chandigarh Police to take stringent action against on traffic violators and impose heavy penalties on them so that it act as a deterrent.
 
 At the same time the high court HC had also observed that public should be educated enough to observe traffic rules when on road. The HC also had stated that people should be aware regarding how they should behave while they were on roads. The court stated, “Why can’t people observe traffic rules and why there has to be police deployed in the roads to make commuters follow traffic rules and regulations?”
 
 The high court also had directed the Chandigarh Police to ensure that pedestrians should be given importance and they should be given right of way. It observed that “public should have traffic sense and give way to pedestrians when there are no traffic lights.”

 Road safety expert Harman Sidhu said, “Majority of the traffic violators are not from Chandigarh. As far as offenders are concerned, along with heavy penalty they should be sent to trauma centres of the PGI or emergency wards of hospitals so that they could see what accidents can do to human life.”
