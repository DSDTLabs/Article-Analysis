VISAKHAPATNAM: Professor of chemistry at  , Madurai, Rajagopalan Vasudevan, was the one who had first came up with the idea of using   along with bituminous for construction of roads. He received the patent for the idea in 2006. While Visakhapatnam only implemented the technology in 2017, other cities across the country have already tried the idea.

  It is an irrefutable fact that in spite of the politicians’ patent promise of “sadak, bijli paani”, ‘sadak’ and ‘pani’ becomes a huge source of problem every monsoon. A case in point is Mumbai.
 
 In 2009, Karnataka’s Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP) used polyblend for upgrading over 40% of its roads. In 2010 both the rest of   and New Delhi followed suit, the latter because of the Commonwealth Games.
 
 In 2011 Pune got its first plastic-bitumen road. A mixture of waste plastic and bitumen was used to relay a 250-metre stretch of the road connecting   road and Cross road within Pune Cantonment Board limits.
 
 Hyderabad experimented with these eco-friendly roads in 2016 and by 2017 they decided to lay more of such roads.
 
 But in the excitement for pothole-free roads a lesson must not be forgotten. Visakhapatnam should learn from Chennai’s mistake. In 2012, the   proposed to lay more than 1,500 km of roads using plastic waste. But the plan fell through. The reason was the shortage of plastic waste of uniform 40 micron thickness. The lack of proper segregation of waste — even plastic — can hinder GVMC’s grand plans of laying more plastic roads.
