KOLKATA: A bank fraud gang that had targeted the   (WBHB) and branched out its network to Guwahati and as far as south India has been busted with the arrest of two agents, one each from Chennai and Puducherry.

 The first instance of forgery came to light in July last year when a person tried to encash a Rs 4.75-crore cheque at a nationalized bank in Mathurapur, South 24-Parganas. He identified himself as the official of a construction firm authorized by the   for construction of a multispecialty hospital. The bank manager grew suspicious and lodged an FIR, but neither the person nor the firm he ‘represented’ could be traced.
 
 The next case was reported from Pan Bazar, Guwahati, where a contractor deposited a forged cheque of Rs 33 crore. The bank officials did not make payment and inquired about the identity of the depositor. An alerted WBHB top brass lodged an FIR with Taltala police station. However, police could not trace the fake firm or its agents. Anxious WBHB officials then asked the nationalized bank to lay a trap.
 
 Seven months down the line, the gang targeted the Velachery branch of the bank in Chennai. On Thursday, an agent deposited a Rs 8.57-crore cheque in which signatures of the housing commissioner and the controller of finance of the board were forged. The bank authorities informed the WBHB about a similar forgery case at its branch in Puducherry. Both the depositers were picked up by police.
 
 “We are extremely worried over repeated attempts of cheque forgery. I have taken up the matter with the police top brass and hope that the brain behind the gang is picked up soon,” housing minister   said. The housing board has blocked the main operating account as a precautionary measure.
