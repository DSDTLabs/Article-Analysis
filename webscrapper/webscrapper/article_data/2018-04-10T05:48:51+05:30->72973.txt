VADODARA: Vadodara's oldest engineering firm,  , is facing a third takeover bid in last three years. Lavjibhai Daliya, a Surat-based businessman, and   Pvt Ltd, have recently made their second open offer to shareholders to buy over 1.28 crore shares of   Ltd, representing the company's 75% of fully paid-up share capital. 

 Daliya had made a similar offer for the first time on July 2015 but it didn't go through. The company is promoted by Rahul Amin, who is the chairman and managing director.
 
 On April 3, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) uploaded a notice stating 'Opening Offer to Buy - Acquisition Window (Takeover) for Jyoti Ltd'. Daliya and Anjani Residency have offered to acquire 1,28,46,744 fully paid-up equity shares of Rs 10 each at a price of Rs 70 per share in cash. 
 
 "Yes, there is an open offer from Lavjibhai and another firm to acquire Jyoti Ltd's shares. But the company is taking all necessary steps to protect interest of its shareholders," a company spokesperson said.
 
 The company's promoters, it is learnt, won't be participating in this bid. Sources suggested that despite the bid, controlling stake of Jyoti Ltd will remain with its current management as most of the shares are closely held. The company believes that the bidders are interested in vast real estate owned by Jyoti in the city.
