PATNA: The RJD will chalk out its future course of action at a meeting at the Lalu family’s residence in Patna on Saturday in view of the conviction of party president Lalu Prasad in the Deoghar treasury-related fodder scam case.

 Senior RJD functionaries, including state president Ram Chandra Purbey, national vice-president   and former minister Jagdanand Singh, met Lalu’s wife   and their younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav at their residence on Friday morning to hold deliberations in this regard.
 
 “The Saturday’s meeting to be chaired by   is likely to be attended by over 2,000 party functionaries and workers, including MLAs, MLCs, ex-MPs and presidents of party’s units in the state’s all 534 blocks. 
 
 “Deliberations will be held on the strategies to be adopted by the party for continuing the fight for social justice spearheaded by  . The party wants to reach every village and tell people how not only the Lalu family but the entire state has been betrayed by CM   and his ally BJP,” RJD’s   unit president Ram Chandra Purbey told TOI on Friday.
 
 Purbey said the party’s fight against the Nitish-BJP combine would be led by Tejashwi, who is the leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly. 
 
 Tejashwi continued to attack the Nitish government on Friday and tweeted, “A sum of Rs 52 lakh was looted in broad daylight at Samastipur; two persons were murdered and crime rate is up 20%. But there is no jungle raj anywhere. Because those in power have managed everything.”
 
 Meanwhile, the Lalu family’s residence — 10, Circular Road — wore a near-deserted look on Friday as Rabri and her two sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap Yadav remained glued to the television screens and took updates over the phone on the hearing on the quantum of punishment to Lalu at a CBI court at Ranchi.
