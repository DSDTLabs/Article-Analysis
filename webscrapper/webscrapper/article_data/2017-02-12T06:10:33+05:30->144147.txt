NAWADA: A village woman gave birth to quintuplets at a private nursing home in the town. Curious onlookers thronged the nursing home. The quintuplets compensated her agonizing five years’ wait for a child. Adding to her woes was her mother-in-law’s never-ending barbs and the sword of threat hanging over her when the mother-in-law kept coaxing her son to go in for another marriage in order to procreate and keep the family line alive. However, of the quintuplets consisting of three boys and two girls, only one from each sex survived.
 
  According to  ,   under   town police station area was admitted to her nursing home on Thursday following intense labour pain. Owing to her abnormal condition, a caesarean was performed and to the utter shock of the doctor and her assistants, five infants, all weighing between 600 to 700 grams, were born!
  
  But fate willed otherwise and two boys and one girl died within hours on Friday. The woman and her family, still at the nursing home, hope the remaining two infants grow and live a normal life. Sudha said had the newborn babies weighed even just over a kilogram, the chances of their survival would have been positive.
