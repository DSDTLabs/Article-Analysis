GURUGRAM: The construction and demolition   proposed in Basai has now hit another hurdle after Delhi-based   Delhi Bird Foundation submitted an application with the National Green Tribunal ( ) stating that waste was being dumped at the Basai site without the requisite permission.

 According to applicants, while MCG has the environmental clearances for the plant, it does not have the permissions from Haryana state pollution control board (HSPCB) as per the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016. 
 
 “There are certain guidelines laid down by HSPCB for the management of the construction and waste disposal and MCG does not have the required permissions under those norms,” said Pankaj Gupta, member of Delhi Bird Foundation.
 
 He added that NGT has directed MCG to find out so as to who is dumping waste at the site and revert back within a week. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for May 11. 
 
 MCG officials, when approached for a comment on the matter, said they had received the notice and they would revert within the stipulated time. “The appointed agency, ILFS, is expected to file a reply in the matter by the next hearing date, which is May 11,” said Sudhir Singh Chouhan, senior town planner.
 
 Notably, a case against the waste plant is already on-going in the green court where the NGO claimed that the site was a wetland and would affect the bird population in the area.
