 Talking about the book, Hussain admitted to have had childhood anxiety herself. She told The Bookseller, “I have lived with my ‘monster’ for as long as I can remember, although it is only as an adult that I have learned to identify the anxiety attacks for what they are and to find coping mechanisms. I remember feeling worried as a child, about everyday things, but not knowing what it was I was feeling or how to talk about it.
 
 "It’s heartening to see   being talked about more openly; we need to find ways to help young children talk about their worries. I sincerely hope that
 will help children and the adults who live and work with them to talk about anxiety together.“

 The book will be published by Hachette Children’s Group. “The nation has taken Nadiya to its heart with her enthusiasm, warmth and sincerity – and sales of her 
 titles show that consumers enjoy Nadiya’s fiction. I cannot think of a better voice to tell the story of a little boy who is followed around by his worry monster," said group picture book publisher,  . She also told The Bookseller that Bailey “is a rising star in children’s illustration”, whose style is “the perfect mix of playful and engaging”.
