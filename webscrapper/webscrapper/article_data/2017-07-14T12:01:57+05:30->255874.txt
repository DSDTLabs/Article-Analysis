Nate Moore, the producer of 'Black Panther' said the Marvel movie will be a vision that blends the formula of  's two biggest series, 'The Godfather' and  . 

  
  
  Moore teased that the Ryan Coogler-directed film was another blockbuster in the making, which stars actor   in the titular role/ T'Challa. 
 
 "(It is) a cross between James Bond and 'The Godfather'... A big, operatic family drama centred on a world of international espionage. So hopefully we're getting the best of both worlds," he said. 
 
 "(The film sees T'Challa attempting to) keep harmony between the tribes within his country, and that means managing expectations and doing things that are unpopular. At the same time, he is the protector of that nation," he said. 
 
 The Bond elements will enter the plot line partially in the form of Nakia, (played by  'o) Wakanda's undercover operative and a former lover of T'Challa's. Also starring Angela Bassett, the film is slated to release next year.
