CHANDIGARH: Seeking stay on her conviction in an abduction and abortion case, senior   (SAD) leader and Bholath MLA Bibi   on Wednesday cited a recent judgment of the   in Sucha Singh Langah’s case before the Punjab and Haryana high court.

 Recently, the apex court had stayed Langah’s conviction in a disproportionate assets case. During the hearing of her plea, Jagir’s counsel referred to the order given in Langah’s case.
 
 The HC, however, adjourned the case for Thursday for further hearing.
 
 On March 30, 2012, the Special   court of Patiala had convicted Jagir Kaur and three others for abduction of her daughter Harpreer Kaur and forcibly making her undergo abortion. The court had sentenced her to five years’ rigorous imprisonment in the case. It had, however, acquitted her of the murder charges.
 
 Jagir had moved the high court against the conviction, following which she was granted her bail. Her appeal against conviction is pending before the high court. The court had, however, not stayed her conviction and because of which she is disqualified to contest election.
