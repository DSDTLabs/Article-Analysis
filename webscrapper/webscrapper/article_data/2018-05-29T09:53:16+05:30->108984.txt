WASHINGTON: Free time seems shorter when it comes just before an appointment, say scientists who found that an upcoming task makes us less productive.

 “We seem to take a mental tax out of our time right before an appointment,” said  , associate professor at  . “We figure something might come up, we might need some extra time, even when there’s no need to do that. As a result, we do less with the available time,” said Malkoc.
 
 In an online study of 198 people, researchers asked some participants to imagine they had a friend coming over to visit in one hour and “you are all ready for your friend to come by.” The others were told that they had no plans for the evening.
 
 All participants were asked how many minutes “objectively” they could spend reading during the next hour and how many minutes they “subjectively” felt like they could spend reading during that same hour. “Regardless of whether they had a friend coming by or not, participants said that they objectively had about 50 minutes available to read,” Malkoc said.
 
 When they were asked how much time they felt they had to read — the subjective measurement — those with a friend coming by felt that they had 10 more minutes missing in their hour — about 40 minutes. The results held up in real-life studies as well.
 
 Participants were then offered the opportunity to take part in either a 30-minute or a 45-minute study. The 30-minute study paid $2.50 and the 45-minute study paid twice as much $5.
 
 For some participants, the study was scheduled in the one hour before they had to start getting ready for their next appointment. The others were not scheduled up against another of their appointments. Even though they had plenty of time to finish the 45-minute study, participants who had an appointment in an hour were significantly more likely than the others to choose the 30-minute study instead of the 45-minute version.
