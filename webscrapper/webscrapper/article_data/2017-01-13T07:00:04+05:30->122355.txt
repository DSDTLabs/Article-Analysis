JODHPUR: Well, it definitely was much more than flying the   on Thursday for the Chief of Air Staff,   at   here. Dhanoa is on a visit to Air Force Station, Utarlai from January 12 to 14, 2017. 

 This is his first visit to a forward operational base as the chief of the Air Staff. He is visiting the forward air base in the western sector to assess operational readiness and review the morale of the personnel stationed there.
 
 
  Dhanoa flew MiG-21 Type-96 aircraft solo which is the oldest fighter fleet in the IAF inventory. Dhanoa flew the same type of aircraft during Kargil operations and carried out many night strike missions in the mountainous terrain. He was awarded   for these gallant acts. 
 
 Interestingly, as per the official sources he is the only other Air Chief after Air Chief Marshal A Y Tipnis to fly a MiG-21 solo. And that happens to be a phenomenal gap of almost a decade and a half. Retracing Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa's relation with this first supersonic jet of the IAF, a pilot's delight much to the enemy's fear, it would be worth mentioning that the current Air Chief was commanding the no. 17 squadron of MiG-21s during during Kargil war. Flying of a solo by the Air Chief in MiG-21 would definitely strengthen the belief in this formidable aircraft.
