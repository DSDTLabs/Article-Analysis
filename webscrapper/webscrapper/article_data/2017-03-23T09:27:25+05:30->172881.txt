LUCKNOW: In a first-of-its kind order, the   has formed   in every   to prepare a report on the number of   and whether they are following norms.

 The report will also compare demand of meat, availability of animals and total capacity of all slaughterhou ses in the district to determine extent of surplus butchering. The report has to be furnished in 7 days.
 
 After the committee, headed by the DM, determines demand and supply, divisional commissioners, DMs and senior police officials have been asked to raid all illegal abattoirs and meat shops to shut them.
 
 The DMs would also need to submit a daily report on number of illegal meat shops and abattoirs closed before 11am every day.
 
 “This is an effective way to crack down on illegal slaughtering.
 
 In Lucknow alone, the daily need of meat is about 250 quintals which includes about 50 buffaloes and over 600 goatslambs but in reality, around 500 quintal meat is slaughtered both in legal and illegal meat shops,“ said a municipal official. According to LMC, over 80% Lucknowites are nonvegetarian which implies there is a need for legal shelter homes which are governed by proper slaughterhouse rules.
 
 Despite UP PCB's order to shut 140 illegal slaughterhouse in UP in 2012, many of them are still operating.
