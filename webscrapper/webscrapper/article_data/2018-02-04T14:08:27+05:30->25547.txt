CHENNAI: A city sessions court on Saturday issued a bailable warrant against the inspector of   police station, for failing to produce the witnesses in court in the 30-year-old murder case involving former   Douglas Devananda.

 When the case came up for hearing, the prosecution informed the court that the investigating officer has failed to produce the witnesses and material evidence of the case. It was further submitted that the officer is not cooperating with the prosecution.
 
 Recording the submission, sessions judge M Santhi issued the warrant against the officer and posted the plea to February 9 for further hearing.
 
 In 1987 Devananda and nine other Sri Lankan Tamils were involved in a shootout at Choolaimedu in Chennai, in which a resident of the locality was killed.
 
 Though all the suspects were arrested, they absconded after being released on bail. A non-bailable warrant (NBW) was issued against Devananda, who later became a minister in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government in  .
 
 He later moved the   for cancellation of the NBW and denied that he was an absconding accused. It was at the end of a second round of litigation that on September 10, 2014, he obtained an order from the high court permitting him to stand trial through video conferencing.
