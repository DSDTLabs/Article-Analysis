Vadodara: Four former office bearers of Vadodara Mahanagar Palika Safai Cooperative Credit Society were sentenced to one year of simple imprisonment by court of additional senior civil judge N H Vasvelia for cheating a moneylender in 2010.

 Buddisagar Solanki, former president of the society, Bharat Solanki, former secretary of the society, and Bhikha Solanki, former manager of the society, had borrowed Rs 1 lakh for the society in 2007 from Rajesh Gupta, a moneylender. Few months after lending the money, Gupta asked for the amount from the accused but they kept delaying.
 
 In October 2010, they gave a cheque of Rs 1.85 lakh, which included the interest amount, to Gupta. But, after Gupta deposited the cheque it bounced as the society’s account did not have sufficient funds. Gupta served legal notice to the society as well as its office bearers under Negotiable Instruments Act.
 
 Gupta’s lawyer RJ Shukla produced documentary evidence of the cheque given to him which had signatures of the Buddisagar, Bharat and Bhikha and other letters. The court upheld the evidences produced by him and sentenced the trio to one year of simple imprisonment and pay Rs 1.85 lakh within three months.TNN
