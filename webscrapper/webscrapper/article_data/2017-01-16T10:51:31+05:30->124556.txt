CHENNAI: Stalls selling books on religion and theology are drawing in more people at the   this year. There are 35 such stalls at the fair which are mostly being frequented by  . 

 "We have 35 stalls selling books based on religion. More than 15 stalls have been set up by Hindu mutts and others. The remaining stalls are set up by Christians and Muslims. It is only in religion-based book stalls the footfalls are high this year," said Booksellers and Publication of South India president  .
 
 It is for the first time, the fair has a stall set up by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department (HR&CE) which has several publications across all temples. "The department has many publications of books by temples under it. But these books are not known to many people, especially in Chennai. We invited the department to set up a stall and this has added to the footfalls in such stalls," said Kannadhasan.
 
 Most of the religion-based book publications are members of the Chennai   and every year they set up stalls. This includes   and Isha Yoga.
 
 "While in other religion-based stalls you get books on their mutts or adheenam, it is only at HR&CE department one can get books on district-based temples. It is a guide for tourists who want to visit famous temples in the state," a senior HR&CE official told TOI. 
 
 On the first day of the fair, the turnover of the HR&CE stall was around 1 lakh and since then the sales have been good. "The top sellers in our stall are the district guides. Within two days we had to reprint more than 5000 copies of the district guides. Similarly, encyclopaedia on Shiva temples in India and around the world which is in 10 volumes is also a bestseller. The 10 volumes cost 12,000 in the market but in the fair it is available for 10,000," said the official.
