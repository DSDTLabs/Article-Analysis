NAGPUR: A group of five people has claimed to have invented a chemical that can substantially reduce pollution caused by   by vehicles plying on roads. If successful, the invention could address the concerns of   ( ) which said over 14 lakh existing vehicles with 300 hitting the streets daily in India were the main cause of air pollution. 

 The team which worked on the project includes Ahad Sheikh, Saleem  , Mohd Saleem Jiva, Mohd Jalil Qureshi and  .
 
 Addressing a press conference at a city hotel in Mahal on Thursday, Ahad Sheikh explained the process by which the new invention would stop emission of harmful gases from two and four-wheelers. Haque said, “The liquid chemical will be filled into a chamber which will be placed between silencer and engine according to the design of vehicles. As the time passes by, the chemical will soak emitted gases such as CO, CO2, HC and make the emissions pollution free.”
 
 They said the oil becomes hard and black (as the colour of chemical is greenish white) after a vehicle runs for 10,000km and therefore will have to be replaced. The thick and black oil can be used as grease. For four-wheelers, the cost will be between Rs1,500 and Rs2,000. The charge will be around Rs400 for two-wheelers.
 
 Haque said that 75% of carbon monoxide emissions come from automobiles. In BS-IV vehicles, only sulphur gas is reduced, but the new formulation will bring it to zero. Haque claimed the team has so far tested BS-III and BS-IV vehicles and six-wheelers, and the emission level has come down to zero.
