ALWAR: The   of two Dalit grooms in   and Bansur areas of Alwar district were taken out amidst heavy police security on Saturday and Sunday.

 In the first incident reported in   village in Bansur on Saturday evening, district administration officials and police stood guard as the wedding procession for Nandu Ram Verma’s daughter was being taken out in full fervour. SHO Mohan Lal   said that Verma had sought police protection on her daughter’s wedding. 
 
 “Verma had feared that some people in the village may create ruckus over his son-in-law riding a mare. There were also rumours about stopping the wedding procession.” Meena said, adding that heavy security arrangements were made to ensure that the wedding procession could be taken out without any hindrance. Bheror DSP   and staff from nearby police stations were also deployed.
 
 In another similar incident in Tusari village of Kathumar in Alwar district, staffs from at least five police stations were deployed for the wedding of Banwari Lal Jatav’s daughter. Jatav had told cops that her daughter will get married on Sunday and some miscreants may try to create problems in the wedding procession of his son-in-law. 
 
 Keeping in mind the threat to the wedding ceremonies, Alwar police deployed its officials and police personnel on the security arrangements. “Jatav’s son-in-law rode a mare to the designated place, the ceremony went peacefully without any problem,” the official told TOI.
 
 The police said that a complaint was handed over by Jatav on Saturday. “We ensured him not to worry about anybody and that complete security would be given to him,” the official said.
