Vadodara: The often long stretched convocation ceremonies that M S University hosts every year might get crisper from now onwards.

 MSU officials are exploring ways to squeeze the convocation ceremony timings, which often extend for hours together leaving students, faculties, parents and at times even senate and syndicate members bored. 
 
 Traditionally, the convocation ceremonies include a procession from university head office to the convocation ground followed by invocation, university song, opening of annual convocation, presentation of graduates, declaration of hundreds of degrees/ diplomas, welcome address, convocation address, address by chief guest, declaration of gold medals, vote of thanks, national anthem and dissolving the convocation. 
 
 Now, efforts are being made to reduce the time duration. “While we may keep the same format, we will make micro changes wherever possible. Also, we will be ensuring that while we make the ceremony crisper we do not bring in such changes which contradict the university handbook,” said a syndicate member. 
 
 The university is also planning to organize ‘We are Proud to You’ programme post-convocation ceremonies. Presently, the programme through which gold medalists are felicitated at ‘Dhanvantri’ – the official residence of MSU vice-chancellor is organized on the eve of convocations. 
 
 In the recent past, MSU’s convocations have also drawn flak for being lacklustre events as the officials have invited more ‘babus’ of higher education as chief guests instead of eminent or outstanding personalities whose speeches can inspire thousands of young minds at the academic ceremony.
 
 “This time, a committee has been formed to break monotony of the ceremony. Since, we have a long time before the next convocation ceremony, we have already started efforts to invite eminent personalities,” added the syndicate member.
