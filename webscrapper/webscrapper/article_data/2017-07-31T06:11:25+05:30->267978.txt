BENGALURU: The city's animal birth control (ABC) programme, considered among the best in the country, has been reeling under a crisis for sometime due to delayed payments, encroached spaces and lack of facilities and coordination among various stakeholders. 

 However, the initiative got a boost after animal lovers and officials came together on Saturday at the new ABC centre in Jakkur to release dual reflective collars for the safety of stray canines. Volunteers were also enlisted for the   (BPS) and will receive training on how to work with community dogs.
 
 Vinay Moray, founder of  , which is running the Jakkur ABC centre, said, "Reflective collars will prevent dogs from dying in accidents at night. It will also bear the   logo so people know the dog was treated at our centre." Thirty stray dogs were fitted with the collars during the drive on Sunday and more will get them in the coming days.
 
 "There were three sterilization programmes from 2007-15 which were successful, but the idea is facing opposition now. We need the support of BBMP officials for more such programmes," Moray pointed out. 
 
 Sarfaraz Khan, joint director, BBMP (health & SWM,) was present at the event along with Dr  , former joint director of animal husbandry. In a   post, Khan acknowledged the delay in ABC programme and spoke on the concerted efforts in place to plug the issue. 
 
 Referring to the meeting with the stakeholders, he wrote, "We have decided to meet at least once a month and monitor the progress. By this, (we are) hopeful the problem of stray dogs will be solved to a great extent."
