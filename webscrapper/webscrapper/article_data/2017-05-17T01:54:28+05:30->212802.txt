NEW DELHI: A day after a Honda City crashed through the railings of a railway bridge near   in west Delhi, another girl injured in the accident succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday morning. The girl,  , had been admitted to a private hospital. The condition of the other three injured is still critical and they have been shifted to the ICU. Garima’s family has decided to donate her eyes.

 Probe has revealed that the car started wobbling after its rear tyre came off. The youth driving the car lost control while trying to save a group of cyclists.
 
 Garima’s family said that she boarded the ill-fated car after repeated refusals by autorickshaws to take her to the exam centre in Narela. Her father, Karan Gupta, sells utensils at a market in  .
 
 Around 7am on Monday, Garima had asked  , the other girl who died in the accident, to meet her outside her house in Inderpuri. “The last thing she told us was that she was running late and had to rush. If we had known about her not getting an auto or a cab, someone would have dropped her,” said a family member.
 
 When autos and cabs refused to take the girls to Narela, Garima called Sanchit. The students in the car decided to return from midway and pick up the two girls from Inderpuri. “It seems Rajat was driving at a high speed after picking up the girls so that they could reach the exam centre on time,” said an investigating officer.
 
 Rajat lost control of the car after the tyre came off. The vehicle swerved towards the left when he tried to avoid hitting the cyclists. However, instead of hitting the concrete boundary, the car rammed through the railings and fell below. The mangled car will be examined by experts to determine the extent of injuries caused to the students.
