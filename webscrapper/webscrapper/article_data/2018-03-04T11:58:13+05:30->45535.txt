 Parents   and Jagdish Gule said that the bus driver was stopped at Nandia village. Principal of the school Ashish Jha said that he has given strict instructions to the drivers and has asked them not take alcohol during duty hour.
 
 Chaurasia said it is also being investigated that despite the complaint of driving the vehicle after drinking liquor the driver was not removed by school management and was allowed to drive.
 
 Parents also gathered on Barwaha police station premises and raised slogans against school management and appealed police to take stringent action against it.
 
 Parents Ravi Kant Soni and Sanjay Parihar alleged that even a fortnight before, a child was left on the road, due to which he was injured by a two-wheeler. They alleged that despite the recent bus accident in Indore, schools were negligent towards safety of children in Barwaha.
 
  The bus driver told parents and principal in public that he drunk liquor on the eve of Holi and was still under its influence. He accepted that he should not have come to school drunken posing threat to the lives of the children.
