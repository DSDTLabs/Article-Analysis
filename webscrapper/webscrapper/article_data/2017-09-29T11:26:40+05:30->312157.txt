MOHALI: Mohali legislator Balbir Singh Sidhu, supported by councillors and residents, raised concerns over wastage of public money in construction of  . 

 He said losses caused should be recovered by seizing the properties of tainted former chief engineer of   Surinder Pal Singh, alias Pehalwan.
 
 Sidhu said, “The precedent has been set by seizing the properties of Dera Sacha Sauda.Properties of Pehalwan must also be seized by the government for re-construction of the road. The Airport Road relaying may cost around Rs 150 crore. There are five stretches, including the Airport Road, that are in a poor state. If all the five roads are to be re-constructed, then the estimated cost will be over Rs 500 crore. This is public money."
 
 Echoing him, Kamal Jain, member of Residents' Welfare Association of Sector 76, said, “It is not only about the Airport Road, but of inner roads of sectors as well. These are also in bad shape. These must be repaired and the money must be recovered from tainted GMADA chief engineer."
 
  (VB) had arrested former chief engineer Surinder Pal Singh Pehalwan on charges of “running four bogus firms to park ill-gotten money“ in June this year after five roads in Mohali constructed during his tenure came under the scanner. He amassed wealth beyond his known sources of income.
