LUDHIANA: In a bid to develop the   in the city for the implementation of the new parking policy, the civic officials have kicked off a survey. The officials will find out through this survey as to where new parking zones can be established. Much hue and cry was raised when the notification of this policy was issued over the imposition of charges for parking of vehicles even in the residential areas. 

 The   has to implement this policy by August 31 and they will establish a park management wing to fix the charges and keep a check on the movement of the service provider (parking contractors). In this policy it was mentioned that residents who will park their vehicles on streets in residential areas will also have to shell out money. The MC will issue the permits to the owners for one year at nominal price. However the officials claimed that they will keep residential areas in free parking zones. 
 
 The superintendent of MC   said the city has to be developed into multiple parking zones so teams from   wing of MC has been told to identify such zones. He said once the zones will identified they will send it for the approval from town planning wing and get them notified. He said policy is aimed at curbing the illegal and haphazard parking on road.
 
 Notably, in the policy the MC has been asked to designate an inspector level officer for issuing the challans for the unauthorised parking. Instead of issuing the manual challans, the officials will do the videography of the illegally parking cars and challans should be sent at their residential addresses. A mobile application should be developed on which even public can send information regarding illegally parked vehicles to the concerned officers.
