NEW DELHI: The Met department has predicted rain in the capital on Friday and Saturday that will bring down the day temperature.

 “The Delhi   faced the third worst dense   of this season after that of December 2 and December 14, 2016. Lower level winds had weakened since the evening of January 2 which resulted in formation of the dense fog,” said the IGI airport Met office.
 
 Tuesday’s maximum and minimum temperatures were higher than normal, touching 24 degrees, four degrees above normal, and 9.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal, respectively.
 
 The Met department has predicted a rise in minimum temperatures over northwest India by 1-2 degrees Celsius during the next 72 hours. There will be no significant change in maximum temperatures in the next two days. 
 
 “In Delhi, we will witness a clear sky that will become cloudy from January 6. Moderate to dense fog, with isolated very dense fog, is expected in the morning hours of the next two days. Light rain is likely in some areas on January 6 and 7. The sky will become mainly clear from Monday onwards. Moderate to dense fog with isolated very dense fog is expected on Sunday and shallow to moderate fog in the morning on Monday,” said an official.
 
 The IGI Met office said that December 2016 had an unusually high number of fog days. The month had a total of 13 days of dense fog over 62 hours against a normal of 6 days over 34 hours. This, said the office, was among the top five Decembers with dense fog in the past 16 years.
