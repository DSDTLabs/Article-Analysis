PANAJI:   and gas prices pinched   hard as   hit record levels in Goa and other parts of the country on Sunday.

 In Goa, petrol price increased to Rs 67.57 a litre on Sunday and is expected to rise to Rs 67.66 Monday, while   an all-time high of Rs 65.33 a litre and will hit Rs 65.44 on Monday as   hovered at $70 per barrel on Friday, the last trading day of the week gone by.

With the daily revision, the price of diesel has gone up by Rs 4.84 per litre over the past three months, while petrol has become costlier by Rs 5.34.
