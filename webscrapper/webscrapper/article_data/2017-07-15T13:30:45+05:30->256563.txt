AHMEDABAD: Even as   proposes to shift its entire manufacturing of Panther military helicopters to India, the Aerospace and defense major is looking at Dholera and Mundra as potential destinations for setting up its manufacturing base. However, the global giant is also eyeing other locations in India. 

 "We have proposed to shift our entire line of Panther helicopters manufacturing to India. Dholera is one of the potential destinations for us to set up our manufacturing facility. Mundra could also be one of them in Gujarat," Airbus Group's vice-president - industry development (strategic partnerships and offsets) Ashish Saraf said on the sidelines of Gujarat Aviation Conclave 2017 organized by Confederation of Indian Industries in Ahmedabad on Thursday.
 
 Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are other states that the French aviation behemoth is also looking at. Earlier this year, Airbus Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the state government during the Vibrant Gujarat Summit for the establishment of an aerospace and defence cluster at DSIR near Ahmedabad.
 
 Talking specifically about Dholera for establishing a production facility for Panther helicopters, Saraf said, "The main reason is its proximity to the ocean. There is a standard selection process and criteria based on which we will finalize a location."
 
 Even the Centre appears positive about the investment in DSIR. "Dholera is ideally situated as far as the major cities of Gujarat are concerned. Airbus is going to build up a manufacturing base in the region. I have been pushing Airbus to visit Dholera and explore how they can place some of their manufacturing facilities particularly with regards to their defence manufacturing," said Jayant Sinha,   - civil and aviation, who was also present at the event.
