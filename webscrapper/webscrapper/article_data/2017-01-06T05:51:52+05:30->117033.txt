JAIPUR: As projects come, this would take the prize for being the most absurd: A   to   for the landlocked desert state of Rajasthan to solve its water woes!

 A total of 61 projects were approved under the now scrapped   (JNNURM) for Rajasthan. Among them was one to set up a desalination plant in an area that comes to about 20 km from the seashore.
 
 The nearest seashore of Rajasthan (Jalore) is at least 300 km away at   in Arabian Sea.
 
 As for the funding pattern for the project, the state was to chip in with 60% of the total cost and the Centre to provide the remaining amount.
 
 After the BJP government scrapped JNNURM projects, funds under the project were transferred to Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). The project to set up the desalination plant along with three other projects became qualified for financial support under  .
 
 Officials, however, remain clueless about the project and expressed their ignorance. “There is no seashore in or around the state and it’s a known fact. I have never come across any such scheme or if it has been sanctioned or approved. It must be some mistake,” said an official who oversee projects under AMRUT.
 
 According to the ministry of urban development, out of the 61 projects approved for Rajasthan under JNNURM, 26 have been completed. Eleven projects were handed over to state government on March 31, 2014, for completion with their own resources. The remaining 24 are being extended further support under AMRUT for which funding will be stopped after March 2017.
 
 “We have received funds to the tune of Rs 275 crore over the past three years from the Centre under JNNURM. Will have to check if the desalination plant has been included for financial support,” said another official of the department.
