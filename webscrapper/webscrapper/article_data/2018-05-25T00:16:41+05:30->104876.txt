NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has sent a   to North Delhi Municipal   after it was discovered that a   used by a gang of   to hide was through an abandoned structure constructed by it. 

 This structure was constructed for use as a pump house. But it was later abandoned, and a metal door leading to the entrance was also sealed. However, there was a vent on the roof through which one could enter the structure. And that’s what the thieves did. 
 
 They broke down portions of a wall to create steps to climb to the top of the structure. When TOI visited the spot on Thursday, we found that access to the structure was through a park that had broken railings and is used as a dumping ground near the   crossing. One had to climb onto the top of the pump house and slide in through a vent. The ground inside was soft and was dug up by the criminals to create holds to store the booty. 
 
 The structure has three rooms, one of which was used as a bathroom while the other two were a storeroom and a bedroom. Foils used to consume narcotics were also found there. 
 
 Police officers said that they have asked the civic bodies to ensure that the hole on the roof is sealed permanently. They suspect that it was also used by others for illegal activities. The area also does not have any lighting, which made the job easier for the thieves. 
 
 In the notice, the police have also requested the corporation to ensure that the building is either demolished or made out of bounds. 
 
 However, senior north corporation officials said they have not received any notice from the police. “We will study it and get the matter investigated when we get the notice. As of now, we don’t know if the said structure is a property of the municipal corporation,” an official added.
