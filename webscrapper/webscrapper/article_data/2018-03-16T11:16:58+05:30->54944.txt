HYDERABAD: Though budgets are presented with much fanfare and pomp, the reality on the ground is that the TRS government has failed to spend the entire budget in all the four years it was at the helm.

 Of the Rs 1.49 lakh crore annual budget for 2017-18, the state could spend Rs 1.42 lakh crore. In 2015-16, the budget estimates presented were for Rs 1.15 lakh crore, but the revised estimates showed that the final expenditure was only Rs 97,922.87 crore. The trend continued in 2016-17 also. The revised estimates of 2016-17 show that the total expenditure was only Rs 1,12,191.07 crore, which is 86.02% of the 1.3 lakh crore budget estimate.
 
 “We spent 90-95% of the budgets. There were problems like demonetisation and   which affected tax collection which led to under-performance in sectors,” admitted finance minister  .
 
 During previous years, several key departments including irrigation, failed to spend the amount that was allocated to it in the budget. A similar situation was reported in the capital expenditure of energy, industry, mineral and infrastructure departments.
 
 Budget allocations under several important heads ended up being transferred to the next fiscal. Finance experts pointed out that the under-performance was evident with increased revenue surplus and fiscal deficit figures. “To raise more loans from open markets, state governments are indulging in showing revenue surplus every year. Financial institutions are keen on revenue surplus and not bothered about fiscal deficit which is a more authentic parameter to determine the health of the economy,” said a senior finance department official.
 
 The finance minister indicated that the state would raise Rs 33,200 crore from open markets during 2018-19. The TRS government has provisioned for Rs 6,594 crore for payment of interest on loans already raised.
