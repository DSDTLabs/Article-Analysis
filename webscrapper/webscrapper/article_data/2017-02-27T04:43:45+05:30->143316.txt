Neil  's wedding celebrations concluded in a glittering ceremony on Thursday at   Palace Resort. Attended by some 500 family members and close friends of Neil from all across the world, the four-day festivities resembled a Bollywood film being shot in Rajasthan. Neil looked every bit a Rajasthani prince in a maroon and golden sherwani, while   was gorgeous in an elaborate red lehenga.
