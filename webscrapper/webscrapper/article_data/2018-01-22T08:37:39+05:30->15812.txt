PONDA: Residents of   taluka had to endure acute   shortage on Sunday after a major   at   burst early Sunday morning. Work to replace the entire 3m pipe was still under way till late evening.

 Sources revealed that the 500 mm cast iron (CI) pipe   on early Sunday morning. As a result, the water division halted supply at 6.30am, and work to replace the ruptured pipe was taken up immediately.
 
 The pipes were procured somewhere between 1982 to 1985, and have weakened owing to continuous use, thus needing replacement. The old cast iron pipes could not sustain high water pressure, said a source. The pipeline supplies water to entire Ponda taluka. 
 
 When contacted, an official of the water division said the work was still on till evening and supply may resume late night.
