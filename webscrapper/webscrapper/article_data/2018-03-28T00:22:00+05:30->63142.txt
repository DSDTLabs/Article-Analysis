Erode: A 20-year-old female elephant was found dead in an elephant proof trench near Sathyamangalam forest here on Monday evening. 

 According to forest officials, the elephant and its three-year-old calf were roaming at Pavalakkuttai village near Sathyamangalam forest. “They tried to enter into an agriculture field. But the mother elephant fell into the elephant proof trench, which was dug to prevent elephants from entering into human habitat, and sustained injuries. The elephant was already suffering from intestinal worms,” said a forest officer.
 
 The farm owner, M Badrinath, 41, informed the forest department. “The elephant could not come out and died on the spot,” said the officer. 
 
 The carcass was taken out of the pit on Monday evening. But due to bad light, the postmortem was conducted only on Tuesday morning. The carcass was later buried inside the forest. 
 
 Meanwhile, when the carcass was brought up on Monday evening, the calf refused to move away from the mother and jabbed it with the trunk. The officials, at last, chased the calf away into the forest.
