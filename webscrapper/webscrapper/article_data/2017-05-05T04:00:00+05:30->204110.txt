Chennai: Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa on Thursday said that he is excited about India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for bringing in dramatic changes in the country. “I am excited about India because of the opportunities. Prime Minister Modi, in front of our eyes, is causing dramatic transformative changes. Business friendly policies, opportunity for all, single minded focus on economic growth, not for his personal benefit, but for the country,” he said.

 He said that Modi was like former Singapore premier Lee Kuan Yew, who transformed a dusty old country into what it is today and not for his benefit. He rented houses. “I call Modi, the Lee Kuan Yew of India,” he said. Modi won with majority and it will help him in transforming the country.
