JAIPUR: Emphasising the need to revisit Vedas,  , the author of ‘Ardor,’ said that scientists, who knew a lot about science and physics, had practically no knowledge about the metaphysical aspects of life.

 During the session, ‘Ardor: On the Vedas,’ Calasso said that the ancient texts deal with consciousness. “Modern scientists know many things about physics but practically nothing about consciousness,” said the author in conversation with Indian physician-turned-mythologist  .
 
 Speaking on Vedas, Pattanaik said, “Today, we’re mainly focused on the material world. No one speaks about the development of the mind. The Vedas search for mental breakthroughs, from ritual to formlessness, matter to mind, and not to conquer the world, but to conquer the mind.”
 
 During the session both authors also spoke on the necessity of understanding the deeper meaning of texts as religion and mythology can be used to promote fundamentalism and chauvinistic nationalism.
