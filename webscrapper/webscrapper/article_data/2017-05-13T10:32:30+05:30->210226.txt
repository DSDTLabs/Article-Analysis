AGRA: A woman who lost her brother, grandfather and other relatives in a road accident last week in which 15 people were killed was made brand ambassador of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in Etah district.
 
   , who tied the knot with an ITBP jawan a few days ago is from   village of Agra. After the wedding when she came to her husband’s house in Nagla Lal Singh village, she found that there was no toilet and was disappointed.
  
  It was on Kalpana’s engagement night on May 5 that 15 people including her relatives were killed in a road accident near   village of Etah district.
  
  When district magistrate   came to know about the woman’s arrival in the village after her wedding, he called her to enquire about her well-being, after which he was told by Kalpana that there was no toilet at her husband’s home.
  
  Kishore said, "I was touched by her story. After losing her dear ones in the horrific accident, she was living an adverse life after her wedding. I along with other officials went to her village and helped in constructing a toilet.”
  
  Kalpana’s husband   and his family were constructing a toilet but it was incomplete and not in a usable condition.
  
  “I was already in agony after my relatives were killed in the accident. The absence of a toilet at my in-laws’ home created more problems for me. Not having a toilet leads to inconvenience and also diseases, so I asked my in-laws to build one. But the DM called on me and I told him about the problem and asked him to get a toilet built here.”
  
  Considering Kalpana’s courage to speak against open defecation, the DM has now made her brand ambassador for Swachh Bharat Mission for Etah district.
  
  “We will invite her to events to share her story and inspire others to make toilets in their homes,” said the DM.
