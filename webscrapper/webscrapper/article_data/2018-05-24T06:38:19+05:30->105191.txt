ASANSOL:   University, where   PM Sheikh   will be conferred a DLitt on Saturday, has made a significant change in the guest list barely 72 hours before the event: “guest-in-chief” and   CM Mamata Banerjee’s name has fallen off the list and this is being interpreted as Nabanna (the state secretariat) snubbing Bengal’s youngest university.

 
 Officials said the “official reason” for the itinerary change was that the university had erred in “including her name without waiting for the secretariat’s approval”. The “unofficial reason” included this but added the CMO had come to know of an ongoing inquiry into “serious allegations of nepotism and financial irregularities originating from the university campus”.
 
 Banerjee, however, will be present at the convocation programme at Visva Bharati University that will be attended by Hasina, PM   and   governor Keshari Nath Tripathi.
