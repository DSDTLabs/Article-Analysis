 The Congress is holding a pan-India "fast" to protest issues like the non-functioning of Parliament and the alleged "dilution" of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
 
 The Supreme Court had on March 20 ruled the government servants not be arrested without prior sanction, and private citizens, too, be arrested only after an inquiry under the law in cases under the SC/ST Act.
 
 It further ruled that preliminary inquiries in a case under the Act be conducted by the Deputy Superintendent of Police to ensure the allegations were not frivolous. The amendment was an attempt to protect honest public servants from being blackmailed with false case. The decision however was termed the Act's "dilution" by various organisations.
