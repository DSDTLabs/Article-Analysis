SURAT: Assistant sub-inspector of Palsana police station   was suspended by superintendent of police   on Tuesday for his alleged involvement in liquor seizure which later disappeared from the police station mysteriously. 

 Following a preliminary inquiry, the ASI was suspended. A departmental inquiry will be carried out against him and if found involved, Yadav will be booked under the new prohibition law. 
 
 Palsana police station is around 13 kilometre from Vareli, the epicentre of hooch tragedy that claimed the lives of 23 people in Surat city and nearby rural areas in August-September last year. 
 
 “It has been found in the inquiry that the ASI had brought the liquor bottles from outside and kept them in Palsana police station. Later he made the bottles disappear after a day,” said Rai.
 
 “Involvement of other police officers has not been found, but the inquiry is not yet over. If they are found involved, action will be taken against them too,” he added.
 
 The inquiry revealed that a police team had raided some place and seized a liquor consignment. The liquor bottles were brought to the police station on December 25 and kept in the office of police sub-inspector N M Prajapati. 
 
 The bottles were later taken out without registering any case. The entire incident was captured on CCTV cameras installed in the police station.
 
 “The ASI will be booked under prohibition charges if found guilty after the departmental inquiry,” Rai said.
