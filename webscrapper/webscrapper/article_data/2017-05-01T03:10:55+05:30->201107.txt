GHAZIBAD: A 21-year-old woman was allegedly choked to death by her husband and in-laws over dowry demand in Khora Colony late on Saturday. The   was initially described as a case of suicide. 

 The woman, identified as Alka alias Neha, was physically assaulted and burnt with a pair of tongs before being allegedly choked to death around 11.40pm. The victim was originally from Aligarh, and was living in Rajiv Nagar area of Khora Colony. She was rushed to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital by her in-laws, where she was declared brought dead by doctors. 
 
 Apparently, Alka got into a verbal spat with her husband Raju soon after dinner. “They tried masking it by calling it a suicide but during our spot visit, we saw that the fan was not bent or broken and also its height was relatively lower with a bed beneath it. Hence it was unlikely to be suicide,” said Jai Prakash Chaubey, SHO, Khora police station.
 
 According to victim's family members, the prime accused is her unemployed husband, an alcoholic who often used to physically abuse her after consuming liquor. “He used to demand money from her and would beat her up almost every other day. Alka used complain about her in-laws’ behaviour, who used to mentally torture her for Rs 5 lakh that they had demanded at the time of the wedding six months ago,” said Kaptan Singh, the woman’s uncle. 
 
 The four accused, including Alka’s husband Raju (24); Neeraj Devi, mother-in-law; Munish Singh, father-in-law and husband's elder brother Bunty alias Veerpal have been arrested. They were sent to judicial custody.
