CHENNAI: A history-sheeter died at a government hospital on Tuesday night after he was hacked by a gang at   in   on May 18. Police said the gang led by Vikas murdered ‘Thakkali’ Bharat. Bharat was remanded in prison following a complaint lodged by Vikas at the Sembium police station.

 Police said Bharat came out of prison on bail on May 15 and went into hiding after he learned that a conspiracy was being hatched by Vikas to eliminate him.
 
 Vikas and his friends constantly watched Bharat’s movements and narrowed down on him at a hideout in Vyasarpadi.
 
 They hacked him with deadly weapons on May 18.
 
 The police solved the murder by arresting Vikas, 20, of Sembium, and his friends Parthiban, Logeshwaran, Ganesan, Vasanthakumar, Nirmal Kumar, Devaraj and Deepak Kumar.
 
 Preliminary inquiries by the police revealed that Bharat had demanded a hefty sum as bribe from Vikas, who was into supplying water through tanker in the neighbourhood, and he attacked Vikas as he refused to give money to buy liquor.
 
 Following Vikas’s complaint, the Sembium police arrested Bharat and a court sent him to prison last month. As Vikas got the news that Bharat was planning to eliminate him on his release, he decided to finish off Bharat with the help of his friends.
