HYDERABAD:  , one of the oldest clubs in the country, has a new entry on the rear side of its 22-acre campus for its members to beat traffic congestion. 

 With the Telangana government determined to take up its prestigious strategic road development plan (SRDP), authorities have asked the Club, which was founded in 1878, to shut gate number one. Also, they cited security reasons as chief minister   travels frequently on   to go to his constituency Gajwel. "From security point of view also, it was advised to close the entry," a top police official said.
 
 The road in front of the Club is narrow and hundreds of vehicles get caught in traffic jams for hours together, particularly during peak hours. "So, we had to open a new entry for our members. The existing entry through Gate-I will continue till the state government approaches us for acquiring land for road widening," Club president   said.
 
 Last month, a new entry was created as per the Cantonment Act rules and regulations. "It is being used now as an exit only," he said.
 
 "Providing new entry to our members is the duty of the Club management. This new entry is wide keeping in view number of vehicles entering the premises. Though we do not have enough parking area on the premises, we are making adjustments based on availability of space," the president said. About eight months ago, roads and buildings department had completed demarcation of properties likely to be affected by SRDP on Rajiv Rahadari on the Jubliee Bus Station-Shamirpet stretch en route Karkhana, Trimulgherry, Alwal and Hakimpet.
 
 As per the SRDP, the road in front of the Club would be widened to 200 ft from existing 30 ft. For this, the Club management has to come forward and hand over the necessary land, as per demarcation, said sources in the R&B department.
