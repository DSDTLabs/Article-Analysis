Visakhapatnam: More than 20% of students who got their PGDM degrees from IIM-Vizag has decided to take up jobs with the AP government.

 Speaking to TOI, four students — Vivek Arvind Patil, Shrinidhi Rajan, Akshay K and Praveen Kumar — explained why they have decided to give corporate jobs a miss.
 
 “Why not? The state government is in a process of rebuilding. This will give us an idea of scale, government operations and the manner in which they can be streamlined, said Patil, who will now work for the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP).
 
 “The number of projects lined up by SAAP is huge. The sports infrastructure in AP is being revamped and this is an exciting time to work for the department,” he added.
 
 Shrinidhi Rajan, who will now work for the R&B department, said, “The dynamism of the new government is truly inspiring. R&B department is taking up futuristic infrastructure projects in a mega scale. With Amaravati coming up, this is the department where all the activities will be concentrated.” 
 
 Akshay K, who will be working for the higher education department said, “The higher education department in AP is being revamped and new projects are mooted. It is an exciting time to make a difference.”
 
 Praveen Kumar, who will be working for the projects section, noted that his job would be to follow up on the MoUs signed by the government and make sure that they fructify. “ I know it is a challenging job but the scale of work is unprecedented and such experience cannot be sought in the private sector.”
