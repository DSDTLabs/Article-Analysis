CHANDIGARH: INLD MLA Abhay Singh Chautala has alleged that the state government had deliberately chosen the   dates from March 5 in order to keep the INLD members away from the assembly on crucial days as they would be busy preparing for the party's 'Adhikar rally' in Delhi on March 7. 

 Addressing the media in Chandigarh, Abhay said the INLD would not fail to discharge its duty of safeguarding the state's interests on the floor of the House.
 
 The leader of the opposition said the INLD would move an adjournment motion and seek a debate over the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue to build pressure on the Union government to complete the canal for facilitating Haryana's share of river water.
 
 Abhay said the INLD would also raise the issue of non-availability of Mewat region's share of water to the Mewat feeder canal and scrapping of the Dadupur-Nalvi canal. 
 
 He said his party has been trying to convince the Centre and the state government to take steps for completing the construction of the SYL canal.
 
 "INLD had offered all possible cooperation to the state government to build pressure on the Centre for the SYL canal. It was unfortunate that the   short on convincing the Centre to implement the decision of the   in this regard," said Abhay. 
 
 He said he regretted that the  's 'Yuva Hunkar Rally' in Jind had failed to even mention the SYL issue. 
 
 "The occasion was used by Amit Shah to make false and concocted claims about the achievements of chief minister   government. Contrary to his claims, the BJP government is involved in rampant corruption and the law and order situation has progressively deteriorated under its watch." he said.
