ALLAHABAD: To give a nationalist colour to the  ,  's (RSS) educational front, ' ', will hold a   on education at   from May 5 to 7.

 "It is for the same reason that VCs, senior lawyers, medicos and academics have been invited and changes will be made only after obtaining feedback from experienced professionals," said Mishra. 
 
 He said the law minister from state, apart from other states would be invited to be a part of the discussion.
 
 An RSS officer-bearer said, "The aim of the discussion is to come out with an alternative to 'westernised' education system. Suggestions would be invited to change syllabus, pattern of teaching and methodology to be used to make the system more 'Indian' in place of the existing western system."
