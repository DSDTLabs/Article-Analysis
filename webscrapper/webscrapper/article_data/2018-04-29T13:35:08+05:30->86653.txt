PATNA: Two days after the income-tax (I-T) department “provisionally attached” a benami property purchased in the name of a shell firm linked with the family of incarcerated   chief Lalu Prasad, deputy CM   on Saturday put the ball in the court of Lalu’s younger son  , asking him to furnish details about the actual ownership of the property.

 According to I-T department sources, the shell firm,  , which goes with the address 130/1 Bakul Bagan Road, Bhawanipore, Kolkata, has Lalu’s two sons – Tej Pratap Yadav, Tejashwi – and daughters Ragini Yadav and Chanda Yadav as its former directors.
 
 The I-T department has “provisionally attached” the 7,105 square feet land and the two-storey building that stands on it. The shell company owned the benami property valued at Rs 76.32 lakh in 2007. It is located on Riding Road, off the Veterinary College campus and Jayaprakash Narayan Airport here. 
 
 “We have the details regarding the shell firm, like the names of its directors and shareholders. However, they don’t point to the real owner of the land and the two-storey building that stands on it,” Modi said, adding Tejashwi could explain it better as his name figured among the directors of the shell firm.
 
 Modi, who had first exposed the shell firm on June 27 last year, said investigations have revealed that the addresses of the shell firm, its 16 shareholders and five other share holding companies, as mentioned in the papers, are non-existent.
