AHMEDABAD: Meghaninagar police on April 24 found a   at an open field in Pushpanagar on Bhargav Road after being informed by the locals about the girl crying profusely. When the police inquired in nearby areas, they found the girl’s maternal aunt. 

  “She told us that the girl, Sapna (name changed), was the daughter of her sister. Her sister and brother-in-law, natives of Auraiya, Uttar Pradesh, were associated with construction work in the eastern city parts. The couple had three children—two boys and a girl. A few months ago, her brother-in-law suffered a grievous injury after falling from a construction site. He left the city with two elder boys, leaving the mother and daughter behind earlier this year,” said a Meghaninagar police official.
 
 The duo lived in Meghaninagar where Sapna’s mother, about 30 years of age, continued the labour work. A few months ago, she came in contact with a man and decided to marry. “According to the statement by Sapna’s aunt, the man did not want any additional burden and it was the reason that Sapna was abandoned on April 24. As the locals knew her, she could be spotted and police were called on the spot. At the moment, the mother has been charged with   of the child. It is suspected that she might have also left for Uttar Pradesh,” said a police investigator.
 
 The city police officials said that on an average the city reports one case of abandonment every month. “But abandonment of a child older than a few days is not very common. On the basis of the investigation, we believe that the father did not want the daughter as the boys could have supported him financially and thus he took the boys. Likewise, the mother saw her as a possible hindrance to her relationship and did not take her along. At the moment, the girl has been sent to observation home,” said a Meghaninagar police official.
