KOCHI: The   would now focus on the concept of family clinics, but a similar scheme, launched when V S Achuthanandan was the chief minister, to emulate  ' was not pursued keenly by the  .

 P K Sreemathy, who was the health minister in VS cabinet, had decided to implement the family physician concept in the state after a visit to Cuba. A pilot project was launched in Vattiyoorkavu primary health centre in Thiruvananthapuram.
 
 A survey was done and screening camps were held to compile the medical records of 48,000-strong population in the area. A software was developed for the purpose and a database that stored medical information of patients including blood groups and drug use history was prepared.
 
 Even though there were plans to extend the project to select PHCs in each district, the UDF government showed no interest to pursue it.
 
 “To collect details of citizens under every PHC is a herculean task. Doctors alone would not be able to manage them when they becomes family clinics. The paramedical and nursing staff will also play a key role here. This would make these clinics more patient-centric,'' said  , additional chief secretary, health.
 
 The main idea behind the family clinics is to create a clinical data bank of the people. At present a pilot scheme for creating a clinical data bank is being run in 11 hospitals in Thiruvananthapuram under the e-health project.
 
 “The primary health care sector in Kerala is a model even today for many developed countries. Hence the family clinics would emerge as a new model for other countries.When e-health is linked to PHCs then data on diseases, immunisation coverage, drug use, etc would be available at your fingertips. This would be a remarkable achievement,'' said Dr N Sulphi, state secretary elect of IMA.
