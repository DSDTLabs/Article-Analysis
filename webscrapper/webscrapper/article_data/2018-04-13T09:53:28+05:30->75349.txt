HYDERABAD: In a huge relief to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) and thousands of candidates who obtained BTech degrees from the university through correspondence cum contact (known as triple C course) mode between 1985 and 2010, the   has revived the validity of these degrees.

 The Hyderabad High Court in a judgement last year declared that these degrees are invalid in view of the mushrooming of distance mode courses even in technical subjects and said several varsities known more for their notoriety and money spinning methods have no business to offer BTech degrees in distance mode.
 
 Supreme Court in its latest judgment delivered on April 10 too upheld the HC judgment. However it exempted JNTU in view of its strong professional credentials. Telangana Additional Advocate General  , JNTU counsel V   along with state government counsel at Supreme Court Palwai   have roped in Attorney General   who urged the apex court to make a distinction between other institutions and JNTU. The bench of Justice   and Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman was convinced about the distinguishing features of JNTU and said that all degrees and diplomas already granted from 1985 to 2010 will not be disturbed.
 
 After 2010, JNTU discontinued the triple C mode of BTech. This course was introduced in 1985 for those working in technical jobs after obtaining polytechnic diplomas in engineering. They were encouraged to obtain BTech degrees through correspondence cum contact programme. However, the problem arose when several dubious educational firms too started issuing BTech degrees through this route. The Supreme Court in its current judgment continued ban on such dubious institutes and the degrees offered by them. It carved out an exception for JNTU and accorded recognition to its degrees.
