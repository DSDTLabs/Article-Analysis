AHMEDABAD: The four Dalit men who were flogged in public in Una in July 2016 have spoken strongly in support of the family of Mukesh  , a ragpicker who was thrashed to death on Sunday in Rajkot.

 The four men — Ramesh, Vashram, Ashok, and Bechar   — were battered for skinning a dead cow. They say that the accused in the Vaniya case should not get bail easily as they may pose a threat to the victim’s kin.
 
 The Sarvaiyas, who plan to visit Vaniya’s family in Limbdi, about 250km from Una, said that two of them had been attacked again by an accused in the flogging case. On April 25, days before 14 members of the Sarvaiya family embraced Buddhism, Kiran   (accused No. 23 in the Una case) waylaid Ashok and   and attacked them with a spade. An FIR was lodged at the Una town police station. “The accused abused the complainant and attacked him because of the animosity harboured over naming them in the flogging incident,” reads the FIR.
 
 “My brothers were saved in the nick of time by police,” said Vashram Sarvaiya, one of the Una victims who will visit Vaniya’s residence on Thursday. Darbar was arrested but released on bail.
 
 “The government had promised speedy trial in our case but that hasn’t happened,” Vashram Sarvaiya said. “We demand a speedy trial in Vaniya’s case. All the 34 accused in our case have been granted bail and the threat we face has intensified. Even in the Thangadh case, in which three Dalit youths were killed in police firing, all the accused are out on bail.”
