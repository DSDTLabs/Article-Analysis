Gurgaon: The Rapid Metro authorities have worked out two fare slabs with the launch of the second phase of the mass transit service.

 Elaborating on the twin slabs, Rajiv Banga, the managing director and CEO, IL & FS Rail, said one would have to pay only   for travelling between Sector 55-56 station and Sikanderpur. And those travelling from Sector 55-56, Sector 54 Chowk or Sector 53-54 to Belvedere Towers, Cyber City, Moulsari or Phase 3 station, and vice versa, would have to pay a flat  .
 
 “Majority of commuters will be those who will travel on the section between Sector 55-56 and Sikanderpur in order to avail the Delhi Metro. Thus, we are maintaining the fare at a minimal level of Rs 20, which the maximum number of travellers pay even now,” he added. 
 
 “Rs 35 will be applicable for only those who will travel beyond Sikanderpur, towards Cyber City from Golf Course Road,” said the managing director.
 
 However, some people are of the opinion that the twin slabs may hit the ridership.
 
  “In August 2014, the authorities had raised the fare from introductory Rs 12 to Rs 20 for a small distance of around 5km, driving away a large number of potential commuters. The daily ridership, which currently stands at 35,000, could have been much higher, had the authorities not raised the fare then. Though Rs 20 is not a big amount these days, the hike did discourage several from using the Rapid Metro,” claimed an insider.
 
 But Banga begged to differ. “The slabs are not high, when compared to auto fares that one needs to pay to travel the same distance,” he said.
