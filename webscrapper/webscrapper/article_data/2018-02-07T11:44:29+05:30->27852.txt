Mumbai: The   of   ( ),  , ended his 37 years of association with the institute, including 14 years as the director. Speaking to TOI, he said the job was tiring and required him to work for 18 hours a day without any break.

 “I need to rest for a few months. After which I will consider the offers that I have on hand. I wish to continue work in mental health, create human resources. The country needs mental health professionals,” said the director, adding that he will be moving out of the campus, once his apartment at Koparkhairane is fixed.
 
 Parasuraman’s term ended in 2014, but since the institute needed more time to appoint the new director, he decided to continue. “The government did not appoint a nominee in the search committee for three years. Finally, last year they released an advertisement and a few names are being considered. It is almost four years now. So I asked the board to relieve me of my duties,” he said. 
 
 The new director will not get a clean slate to start with, said the outgoing director. “No one starts with a clean slate. He will have to build on it and develop the institute further,” he added. The past year has been tumultuous for the institute as the center decided to discontinue the grants to three of the centers at the institute. “We were having a dialogue with the center. The new director needs to continue with the discussion to ensure these centers are not shut down. The problem is not faced by TISS alone and other premier central universities too are facing it. If the government is not releasing funds, the institutes will have to raise it on its own,” said the director.
