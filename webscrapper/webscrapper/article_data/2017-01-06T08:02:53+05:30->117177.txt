KANPUR: A 52-year-old woman, who was alone, was found murdered in her house in Babupurwa locality of the City on late Wednesday evening. The deceased has been identified as one Radha Devi. 

 Police suspect the role of somebody close to the deceased as there was no sign of forced entry. When this grisly incident took place, the woman was alone in the house while her elder married daughter along with her husband and six younger siblings had gone to an amusement park in Bithoor area of the City.
 
 "The assailant had slit open the woman's throat. The incident came to light after her elder daughter along with her husband and six siblings had returned home from Bithoor. On entering the house, they found her body lying in a pool of blood with her throat slit-open. They raised an alarm and apprised other people of the area of the incident, who immediately alerted the police control room, which in turn informed Babupurwa police about the murder", said an investigating official while talking to TOI.
 
 According to police, a dog squad and finger print experts rushed to the site and joined the investigating team. The police however have not ruled out robbery as a possible motive behind the gruesome killing. "It will be too early to draw any conclusion as the investigation is still in its initial stage. We are questioning locals, besides her son-in-law in this regard. Her body has been sent for postmortem examination. Besides a dog squad a forensic team is examining the spot and gathering possible clues for solving the mystery behind the murder," said SSP Akash Kulhari.
