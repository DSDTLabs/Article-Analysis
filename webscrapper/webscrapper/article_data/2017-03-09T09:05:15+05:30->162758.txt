Angered by the alleged killing of an Indian fisherman by the   two days ago and as a sign of expressing their protest, fishermen associations here have decided to boycott the annual church festival at   islet scheduled this weekend. 

 Every year, the annual festival of St Antony's church at Katchatheevu - 12 nautical miles away from Rameswaram - attract hundreds of pilgrims from fishermen villages and across the state and neighbouring states. This year, about 4,500 pilgrims are to attend the festival scheduled on March 11 and 12. Around 145 fishing trawlers were also identified to take the pilgrims on the two-hour voyage to the islet. 
 
 Expectations were running high this year as a new church has been constructed by the   diocese with the help of Sri Lankan Navy and Rameswaram fishermen have pooled in the money to donate the flag mast and church items at a cost of 2.40 lakh. 
 
 Under these circumstances, 22-year-old K Bridjo from Thangachimadam in Rameswaram was killed while he was on fishing expedition along with others in   on Monday night. Alleging the Lankan navy's involvement, fishermen across coastal districts of Tamil Nadu are staging protests.
