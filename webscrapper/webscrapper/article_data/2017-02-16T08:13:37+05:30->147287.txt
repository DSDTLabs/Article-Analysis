SURAT: A poster has broken out between BJP leaders in Limbayat area over celebration of   that falls on February 19. Till last year, Shivaji Jayanti was celebrated together by all BJP leaders. 

 However, this year BJP councillor from Limbayat   has decided to celebrate Shivaji Jayanti in his own way. He has invited state Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki and senior leader Tushar Chaudhary for the function. He has also put up posters inviting people for the function. The posters have pictures of Solanki and Chaudhary prominently printed.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP MLA   and Jignesh Patil, son of Navsari MP C R Paatil, too have begun preparation to celebrate Shivaji Jayanti in a separate function. The event is likely to be a show of strength before the assembly elections later this year. They too have put up posters inviting people to the Shivaji Jayanti celebration. Their poster have pictures of CR Paatil, Sangita Patil and other BJP members.
 
 In the name of Shivaji Jayanti, rift between the BJP leaders in Surat city seems to have been exposed.
 
 After Dr Ravindra visited Congress headquarters on Tuesday, there were speculations about him joining Congress. It appears as if Dr Ravindra wants to test the waters and see how much support he gets if he called Congress leaders.
 
 Dr Ravindra told TOI, “In the past we had invited the MP of our area for various programmes but he never came. So this time we decided to call people from all parties and those who gave us consent. Their names are printed in invitation letters. Congress leader Solanki has consented to come. This is not a political forum and hence I went to invite him personally.” 
 
 Jignesh Patil on the other hand said, “This year there seems to be 4-5 groups that will celebrate Shivaji Jayanti in Limbayat. But we have been celebrating it since four years under Youth for Gujarat and Jay Bhagwa Group.” He further said that he was aware that Ravindra Patil had invited Congress leaders for the function.
