Mangaluru: Autorickshaw and taxi drivers should be given training in dealing with accident care and identify their services they render during accidents, said   MP and former Union minister Oscar Fernandes.

 He was speaking after distributing cheques to beneficiaries to buy autorickshaws under Swawalambala Scheme of Karnataka State Minority Development Corporation on Sunday. Oscar said accident victims in most of the cases get immediate help from autorickshaw drivers or taxi drivers. Hence, the government should identify such drivers as recognized volunteers and give training, he said and added that the same suggestion has been conveyed to the labour minister.
 
 “It was former Prime Minister  , who opened the door of banks to poor in the nation through nationalization drive. Banks in India were extending financial support only to rich prior to bank nationalization. Bank nationalization also resulted in making drivers themselves the owners of vehicles they drive,” Oscar said. 
 
 Chief whip of ruling party in   Ivan D’Souza said the government should increase the sanctions under various schemes under the corporation.   J R Lobo the state government under chief minister Siddaramaiah is more responsive towards demands of minority communities. 
 
 Karnataka State Minority Development Corporation chairman M A Gafoor said 40 cheques worth Rs 11.26 lakh have been distributed as part of the programme.
