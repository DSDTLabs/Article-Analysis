HYDERABAD: Meet Surinder  , 52, who has the rare distinction of undergoing three kidney transplants, making him the first such case in south India. Sahoo underwent his first   in 1995 and the last one was carried out in 2013.

 Though it has been four years since the third renal transplant, Sahoo is leading a healthy life and is the sole bread winner of his family.
 
 Sahoo underwent the last of the rare and complicated surgery in 2013 at  . “I had my first kidney failure when I was just 28 years old in 1995 and the second time after a gap of 12 years in 2011. After I developed complications in 2013, I was kept under home dialysis and finally got operated upon after being advised by doctors,“ Sahoo said. Unfortunately, there were no donors in his family for transplant, so he was registered for cadaver transplantation under Jeevandan scheme and he underwent his third transplant with a deceased donor kidney.
 
 Sahoo spent about Rs 15 lakh for his treatment, but said it was worth the risk. Sahoo was supported by his wife Deepti, who resigned from her job to take care of her husband.
 
 Speaking about the rare surgery, Dr   said that it lasted for six hours as against four hours for any regular transplant. “The success rate of this kind of surgeries is very low, chances of kidney transplants are also high. However after four years, he is leading a normal life with the aide of immunosuppressive drugs,“ he said. Dr Malakondaiah said patients having advanced problems are given the option of transplant as it is better than regular dialysis which largely impacts their quality of life.
 
 “We have successfully managed several kidney transplants across blood groups -Sahoo's is O Positive. We even help patients get organs in swap method when a patient's family members cannot become donors,“ Dr Ravindranath, chairman of the hospital said.
