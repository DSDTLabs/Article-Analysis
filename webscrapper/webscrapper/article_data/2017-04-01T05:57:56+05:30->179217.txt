SALEM: The   (MoCA) has given the licence to   to operate flights to Chennai and Bengaluru via Puducherry and Salem. Chairman of the Indian Chamber Of Commerce and Industry   Chapter K Mariappan told TOI that   will operate 28-seater aircraft to these destinations from September. 

 The MoCA recently included the defunct Salem airport for regional airport connectivity. It said that by the year-end it will operate small flights from the Salem airport. Based on this, MoCA had invited airline companies to participate in the bid. 
 
 "A total of 11 airline companies participated in the bid, of which seven met the eligibility norms," Mariappan said. As far as the Salem airport concerned, only the Air Odisha offer of Chennai-Puducherry-Salem-Bengaluru and return flights was approved. 
 
 The Salem airport started functioning in 1993. For a few months, NEPC, a private airline operated flights between Chennai and Coimbatore via Salem. The company later closed its operations citing poor patronage. After this, the airport was closed for more than 16 years. TNN
