PUNE: A confidential circular issued by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited’s chief engineer of the Pune zone asking officials to send information about the Right to Information activists filing more than two applications has triggered a row.

 Citizens’ group   founder Vivek Velankar, himself an   activist, brought this matter to light on Wednesday alleging that the distribution company official was going beyond his brief. Velankar said such a circular was uncalled for and amounted to stonewalling the RTI Act itself. He said he had filed three RTI applications and was ready to face any action.
 
 An official of the distribution company told TOI that the power utility was taking information about the matter and would present their version in due course. “However, we will continue to provide information sought under the RTI Act,” he said.
 
 The circular dated March 15 directs all senior officials in the division to compile a list of persons filing more than two RTI applications and send the same to the chief engineer’s office in seven days. All details, including the names of the applicants, addresses, and topics on which information sought and if information were given, have been sought.
 
 The circular gives reference of the   order (  vs  ) stating that if any person is misusing the RTI Act then such behaviour should be controlled as per law.
