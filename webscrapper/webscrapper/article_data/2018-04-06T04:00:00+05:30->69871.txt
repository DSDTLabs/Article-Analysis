Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has decided to start city bus services on three routes in the wee hours and night hours from April 7 from the railway station.

 These routes include Vivekananda College, Jahangirpura to Surat railway station, Kosad village to railway station and Dindoli to railway station. Hundreds of people start early for their work to board the trains, mostly bound for Ahmedabad or train Gujarat Queen that departs from Surat at 5.30 am. Those going towards Mumbai have to catch train Flying Ranee that departs at 5.10 am. On return, both these trains touch Surat station around 10.30 pm. 
 
 The bus service will help people living in these three areas as they need to start as early as 4 am from their houses to reach the railway station. The frequency of the buses would be every 20-30 minutes . This would benefit passengers travelling in about 20-40 trains during wee hours and night time. 
 
 The city buses would ply from 4 am to 11.30 pm on these three routes.
