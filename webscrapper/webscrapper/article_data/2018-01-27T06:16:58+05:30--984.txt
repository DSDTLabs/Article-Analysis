BALLARI: Anand B Singh,   MLA from   constituency, is set to resign on Saturday. On Thursday, he announced his decision after meeting his confidants in Hosapete. By all indications, he’s likely to join the   on February 10 in the presence of AICC president   in Hosapete. At the same function, B Nagendra, independent MLA of Kudligi will also join the Congress.

 With these two joining the Congress, the party will take over the   zilla panchayat, Hosapete and Kudligi taluk panchayats and several gram panchayats. Ballari ZP has 40 seats with BJP (21), Congress (17) and 2 independents. Due to the lack of cooperation among district Congress leaders, the BJP managed to get one independent’s support and came to power.
 
 After being an MLA for two terms, Nagendra is rejoining the Congress, assuring the Congress power in ZP and Kudligi taluk panchayat and several gram panchayats. The biggest challenge for B Sriramulu and G   is finding candidates for these two constituencies. H R Gaviyappa, ex-MLA and Congress leader, is ready to join the BJP after quitting the Congress. BJP assured Gaviyappa of his B form, and party support.
