NEW DELHI: Two men have been arrested for the murder of a 25-year-old   whose body was found near Ghata Masjid in Daryaganj in early May. 

 The police used two tattoos on the victim’s arm to identify the  , who turned out to be a vagabond staying near Chandi Chowk. Rahul Kumar alias Salman and his associate, Kaaliya, were arrested near Fountain Chowk on Thursday. From two words written on the victim’s right hand — ‘Soni’ in Hindi and ‘Rahul Kumar’ in English — the police got to know that she used to live with Rahul on a footpath. 
 
 Cops had to scan through the profiles of more than 4,500 people staying on the footpaths around Daryaganj to track the accused. It was difficult to identify Rahul as most of the people staying on these footpaths are migrants who keep travelling back and forth, said DCP (central) Mandeep Singh Randhawa. “Neither anybody came forward to file a case nor any one knew Rahul by his face. A team led by SHO (Daryaganj) Mangesh questioned every footpath-dweller in the area to crack the case,” he said. 
 
 The CCTV footage were also examined, but due to a storm on the night of the incident, the videos were blurred. Finally, cops traced Rahul and Kaaliya near the cycle market in Chandni Chowk.
 
 Rahul later told the police that he had fled after the murder. On the day of the incident, he was with Soni and Kaaliya had joined them later. They had a drink, following which Rahul accused Soni of stealing his money and having several affairs. When she denied the allegations, an argument broke out during which Rahul strangled Soni with her dupatta. 
 
 The duo then dragged her to the corner of a park and smashed her head with a stone. 
 
 The police said both Rahul and Kaaliya were from Bihar and used to work as labourers in Delhi. Rahul and Soni had met at a construction site and started staying together. 
 
 During this investigation, the police have also solved the murder of another woman who was killed and dumped in Gurgaon.
