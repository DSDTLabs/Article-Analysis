BENGALURU: After speaking to over 2,000 people, Australian police investigating the murder of Indian national Prabha Arun Kumar in a Sydney park have sought public help in solving the case. 

 News   police said apart from the victim's friends, relatives and family members, they have also asked others to share any information that could help solve the case, identify the assailant and the motive behind the killing.
 
 The  , established to investigate the circumstances surrounding Prabha's murder, continues to follow numerous lines of inquiry, they said, adding: "As investigation is on, it isn't appropriate to comment on specific details or lines of inquiry, nor will detectives engage in speculation about the investigation." 
 
  On March 7, 2015, Prabha, a software engineer, was on her way home after meeting a client and was speaking to her husband on phone when she was attacked in   at 9pm. She was critically injured and died later. 
 
 A three-member team from   police, headed by homicide department commander Richi Sim and comprising constables L Daniel and Bika Singh, arrived in Bengaluru on January 14 and questioned Prabha's family, frie- nds and colleagues. A senior technical analyst with Mindtree, Prabha was in Sydney on an assignment and was living alone in Strathfield. 
 
 The Australian team questioned Prabha's husband Arun Kumar, a software entrepreneur, for over five hours, a local police source privy to the developments said. "Taking help from CID police, the team visited Prabha's parental house in Amtur, Bantwal, Dakshina Kannada district, and interacted with them. It is said the team gained a vital clue during this visit," the source added.
