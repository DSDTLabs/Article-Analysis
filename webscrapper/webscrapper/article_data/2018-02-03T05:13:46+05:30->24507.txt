THANE: In order to make it convenient for residents to pay property tax and  , the municipal   will remain open on all weekends—including second and fourth Saturdays.

 Deputy municipal commissioner   said, “The officials from these two tax departments will function on all weekends till the end of the financial year, which is March 31. This will help citizens who are working during the week. With this move, they will be able to visit the local municipal office and clear their dues.’’
 
 The tax collected from property owners and on water is one of the biggest source of funds for the civic body. Last year, the civic collections from these two departments had soared considerably after the government demonitized the high-value currency but allowed public institutions to receive those notes towards tax dues.
 
 Divate is optimistic that decision to keep offices open on weekends will give a needed push to the civic revenue. As per the initiative, the water and property tax departments will stay open from 10am to 5:45pm on all Saturdays and public holidays. However, the office will be shut on March 2, on account of Holi. On Sundays, the timings will be from 10:30 am to 2 pm.
