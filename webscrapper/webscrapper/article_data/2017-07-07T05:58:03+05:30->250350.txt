KOLKATA: Mayor   on Thursday said he has received the  's Narada probe summons, but could not understand what the central agency wanted from him. 

 Chatterjee, also the state fire and environment minister, said, "I can hardly understand what the ED wants to convey through the notice." He said he would appear before the ED, but refused to mention a time frame. "If I need to visit the ED office, I will do that," he added. The ED has summoned the minister - named as an accused in the Narada case FIR - for questioning on Monday.
 
  The summons was sent to Chatterjee's Behala home on Wednesday. There was much drama when ED officials visited Chatterjee's residence to serve him the notice. His assistant refused to accept it, saying he was not authorized to receive any letter. After about 15 minutes, he finally agreed to accept the notice.
 
 Summons have also been sent to Trinamool MP Sultan Ahmed and deputy mayor Iqbal Ahmed. While Sultan Ahmed has been asked to appear on Thursday, Iqbal has been summoned on Friday. 
 
 In June, 2016, Chatterjee's wife Rita had filed an FIR claiming that the Narada tapes were intentionally brought to public before the election to defame her husband. She alleged that the sting operation tried to influence the electoral process. Police later slapped IPC charges under sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 171 (G) (false statement in connection with an election), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 469 (forgery for the purpose of harming reputation).
 
 Minister Subrata Mukherjee, also named in the Narada FIR, termed it a political move. "Now, the Centre will use all its agencies to crush democratic dissent," he said.
