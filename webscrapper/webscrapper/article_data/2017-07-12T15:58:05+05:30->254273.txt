At a time when the whole of Kerala is discussing how  's role in the actress assault case has landed him in jail, there were reports that his ex wife and actress   is planning to move the court for the custody of her 17-year-old daughter Meenakshi.

 
 
 However, sources close to her say that the news isn't true. "She isn't someone who jumps at a hasty decision and Manju has been quite busy with the shoot of the Kamal film 'Aami.' Yes, she is very close to her daughter, but she hasn't said anything about moving the court for Meenakshi's custody," said a source close to Manju Warrier. The source also says that the reports about Manju breaking down on the set of her film upon hearing about Dileep's arrest are also not true.
 
 Meenakshi has been living with Dileep and his current wife Kavya Madhavan, so far. When Dileep and Manju divorced in 2014, the teenager had chosen to be with her father. Manju had said on her Facebook post that she respects her daughter's decision and that she will be happy with him.
