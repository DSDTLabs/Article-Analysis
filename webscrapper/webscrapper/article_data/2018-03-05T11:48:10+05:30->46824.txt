HYDERABAD: Telangana BJP president K Laxman on Sunday dared the AIMIM to contest all the 119 seats in Telangana on its own. “What the strength of   is and what strength BJP has will then be known,” he said throwing a challenging to MIM for the 2019 polls. “The Congress, TRS and MIM are all one. They have ganged up against BJP,” he said.

 Laxman charged chief minister   of standing on prestige rather than simply acknowledging and regretting that he had referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech. “When KCR’s son, KT Rama Rao and daughter Kavitha have clarified that it was a slip of the tongue on the part of their father, why is   taking it as aprestigious issue to admit his fault. Everyone makes mistakes. He should have simply admitted his mistake,” Laxman said.
 
 The BJP leader alleged that for Central schemes the TRS government was not giving its share of money and also not showing utilization certificates. Laxman wanted to know how much money was allocated in the state budget for Kaleshwaram Project by the state government when they were asking for a national status for the project seeking funding.
 
 “The CM cannot go on long with his gift of the gab. People can see through him. He uses language that is unacceptable and disrespectful,” he said.
 
 Laxman said elections in the North-East were a sign of the frustration of the people. He said all that PM had done for the country was being recognized. “I am surprised the CM chose to devote one and a half hours taking to the media when results of the North-East states were announced. It was strategic,” he said.
 
 In preparation for 2019 polls, he said BJP leaders would concentrate on Telangana. “When polls in   are held and results will be out, KCR will be stunned into silence,” Laxman said.
