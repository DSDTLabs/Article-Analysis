GAYA: Following Friday’s massive crackdown against the sand/stone mafia and commercial tax evaders, at least 13 FIRs have been registered and 67 persons sent to jail for their alleged involvement in clandestine activities. On Friday night, raids were conducted all along the Bihar stretch of NH-2 and 335 heavy vehicles were seized on different charges, including overloading, illegal transportation and evasion of commercial tax. Altogether 208 persons were also detained for their suspected involvement in illegal activities.

 Confirming the registration of 13 FIRs at different police stations and arrest of 67 persons, zonal IG   on Sunday said four others were being interrogated by the police. He said 100 of the seized vehicles have been handed over to the forest and commercial tax department officials, who will take the final call on appropriate legal action as per the rules.
 
 “Drive against illegal transportation, commercial tax evasion and overloading will continue,” the IG said. During one such exercise, the Aurangabad police seized 2,300 bottles of Indian-made foreign liquor on Saturday night. The vehicle used in liquor smuggling has been seized, said the IG. District magistrates and SPs of Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas and Kaimur districts have been asked to monitor the drive.
 
 The IG said he would submit a detailed report to the police headquarters and the government on the ongoing racket that, besides considerably depleting the state exchequer, was also causing heavy damage to the roads.
