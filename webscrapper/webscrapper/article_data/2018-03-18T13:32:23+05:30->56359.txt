CHARMINAR: Walk by it and you wouldn't even know that the pile of stinking garbage in the ridge area near   hides an architectural wonder of the   era. 

 The   (step well) once served as a drinking water source to a sizeable population living in the area. But not only has the archaeology department failed to take any steps to preserve the heritage structure from encroachment, it has even let it become a dump yard.
 
 "Thanks to the apathy of government agencies and local residents, this stone-carved edifice is now filled with garbage,"  , a local activist, said. "The step well is slowly turning into a stinking pool with sewage water flowing into it."
 
 Only broken arches and tunnels that were constructed for the passage of water have withstood the test of time. But these have not withstood the ravages of people.
 
 "The stink that comes from the   is unbearable. It has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes. It is high time that people stop dumping waste into the heritage structure,"  , a resident of Karwan, said. 
 
 "Though Hyderabad is a repository of heritage and architecture, the Baolis, which are one of the most fascinating of them, are undervalued by the residents and authorities," said  , a city-based conservation architect.
 
 When contacted, an official of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), who did not wish to be named, said they will send the area-in-charge to inspect the Baoli and take necessary action.
