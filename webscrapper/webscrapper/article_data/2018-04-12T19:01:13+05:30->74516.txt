The canvas is enchanting with serenity of lush landscape bringing a spiritual connection. Using the medium of watercolour and pen and ink, two artist friends from Mumbai,   and   are displaying their art works on peace and spirituality titled, ‘In Search Of Light And Peace’. “We have been friends for over a decade now and have been painting together for a very long time. This exhibition is about our spiritual experiences and yearnings that we are trying to convey to the people. The subjects on the canvas are spiritually relined, connected with the nature, like monks in the mountains and beside a river, meditation or in search of within and outside. It’s more like landscape with the spiritual connection,” says Prashant.
 
  Prakash is presenting a series highlighting the subject ‘peace’. “The intricate illusionist lines in the background is an expression of those positive universal waves which we are surrounded with and how through this phenomena, we can elevate ourselves to a transcend state of mind and create a silence,” he explains.
