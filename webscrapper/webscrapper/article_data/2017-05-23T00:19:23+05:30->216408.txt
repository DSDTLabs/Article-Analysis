Madurai: Tension prevailed at Periyar bus terminal in Madurai city on Monday as a group of fans of actor Rajinikanth staged a protest burning an effigy of the leader of a lesser known outfit Tamizhar Munnetra Padai. The fans were venting their anger at the outfit for marching to the actor’s residence in Chennai against his reported move to enter politics. 

 Ever since the actor started meeting his fans for facilitating photographs with him, discussions about the possibility of the actor taking to politics had been doing the rounds. TMP led by its leader Veeralakshmi marched to the Rajini’s house in Poes Garden earlier in the day. As they were stopped by police several metres away from the house, they burnt the effigy of the actor. tnn
