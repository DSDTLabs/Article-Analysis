NAVI MUMBAI: At a public hearing held recently in   by the Raigad district authorities for the proposed development of an integrated township in the taluka, social workers and   strongly objected to the fact that the public hearing was held at a   and that the   report was printed in English and not Marathi, making is difficult for the poor tribals to understand the impact of the proposed township called ‘Orange Smart City’.

 Raigad based activist, Vaishali Patil said, “ I urged the authorities to postpone the public hearing as the EIA report was in English which the tribals cannot understand. Also, the public hearing was held during monsoon season, when most tribals are busy in paddy fields.” Patil added that the proposed Orange Smart City integrated township will be spread across 16 tribal hamlets having a total population of around 6,000; hence it is vital that all the tribal residents of Pen were properly informed.
 
 A woman tribal sarpanch of the Balwali group grampanchayat, Poshi Vithal Pawar, also raised the question at the public hearing as to why it was being held when the tribals, landless labourers and other poor villagers were extremely busy working. 
 
 However, the government officials told them that they have to complete the public hearing as they are formally announced it earlier in order to know the suggestions and objections of the locals. — Vijay Singh
