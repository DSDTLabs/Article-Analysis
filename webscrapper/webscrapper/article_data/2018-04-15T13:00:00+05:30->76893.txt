 While talking about the show Pallavi Joshi aka Rama said, “I am always fond of thriller and horror stories. But when I was asked for the show, initially I was planning to refuse the offer. But after reading the screenplay, I decided to do it. The story of the show is based on the book   which is written by Dharap. So firstly I read the entire book to know more about the characters. And certainly, the show story is twisted little bit than the book and will be only of 100 episodes.”
