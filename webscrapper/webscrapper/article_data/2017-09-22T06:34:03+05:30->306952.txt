GUWAHATI: Cutting across party lines,   is resisting any attempt to confer citizenship on   who fled to the state from erstwhile East Pakistan in the early 1960s. Most in the frontier state are of the view that granting of citizenship rights to the   goes against the very Constitution that protects them against migrations and their influence.

 Under various constitutional provisions, the predominantly tribal state enjoys special protection against the settlement or influx of outsiders and alien culture. Outsiders, including Indian citizens, are neither allowed to possess land in the state nor are permitted to visit it without   (ILPs). This system of entry into Arunachal, earlier known as North-East Frontier Agency, is derived from the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873.
 
 The office of the state's BJP chief minister Pema Khandu was unequivocal about its stand on the issue. It said, “The chief minister is clear about his strong commitment to protect the sentiments of the indigenous people of Arunachal.“
 
 Former Congress chief minister Nabam Tukiwas equally firm in opposing granting of citizenship to the refugees. He said, “Our state has always been steadfast in its opposition to the decisions (granting citizenship to the refugees) of the Centre and the Supreme Court.“
