KOLKATA: '  mukti aloy aloy, ei akashe' (My liberation is among the light, within the sky). The song, one of the most common Rabindrasangeet, was originally penned differently by the poet. 

 In a manuscript that is set to be exhibited at the Victoria Memorial Hall ( ) on May 9, the poem's opening line goes thus: Amar mukti gaaner sure, ei akashe (My liberation is in the tunes of songs, within this sky).   wrote it on September 19, 1926, in Nuremberg, two decades before the German town hit the headlines during the Nazi trials at the end of World War II.
 
 Tagore altered the words later, perhaps when the song was set to tune some time in the next decade. The evolution in the poet's handwriting is evident in the two manuscripts, one in VMH's possession and the other in the form of a scanned copy of the manuscript retrieved from  , an online Tagore variorum. While both handwritings have the poet's inimitable flourish, 'Amar mukti ganer sure' is distinctly written by a hand that is more firm than one that wrote 'Amar mukti aloy aloy' a few years later.
 
 VMH had initially planned to put a rare portrait of Tagore by   on display at the Prince Hall to mark the poet's birth anniversary on 'Pachishe Baisakh' (May 9) but finally opted for the eight-page mauscript containing around 15 poems as the latter was off the beaten track. 
 
 "The more popular songs of Tagore, some of them that have almost become cliched, are taken for granted. 'Amar multi aloy aloy' is one such song. Yet, it has an interesting biography. We will showcase the mauscript that was gifted to VMH (collection no R7038) in 1987 by Saroj Kumar Chatterjee, a resident of Rashbehari Avenue who had family connections with Tagore," said VMH curator Jayanta Sengupta.
