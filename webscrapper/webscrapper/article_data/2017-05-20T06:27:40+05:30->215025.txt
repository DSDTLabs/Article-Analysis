NAGPUR:   Synthetics (India)   (IRSIL), which has a unit at   industrial estate of  , has posted a net loss for the financial year ending March 31. As against a profit of Rs37 crore during the last fiscal, the losses stood at Rs84.23 crore this time, said a press release issued here.

 IRSIL’s chairman O P Lohia told TOI that the company was seeing better times in the current quarter and forward. Business had taken a hit due to demonetization that hampered the performance during earlier quarters of the financial year. Things were improving now. As a result, though it was still in loss but performance for the March quarter was better than the previous one, said Lohia.
 
 Lohia said the company was expecting that goods and service tax regime (GST) would bring better times for the industry. It would bring synthetic fibre industry at a level playing field. At present, synthetic fibre makers like IRSIL paid excise duty ranging from 16% to 18% and there was none on cotton fibre, he added.
 
 GST would be having fibre neutral rates. This means there would be a single rate for all types of fibres. It would create a level-playing field. The industry expected that the government should fix rate at 5% so that it was not too harsh for cotton fibre makers too, he said.
 
 Lohia said the company’s focus for the coming months was also on increasing capacity utilization at Butibori. The capacity utilization was at 65% to 75% at present, it was aimed to take it over 85%, said Lohia.
 
 IRSIL is the first company to have invested in the Butibori industrial estate when it was set up in the 1990s. 
 
 It is the country’s largest polyester manufacturer. Its integrated manufacturing complex at Butibori has a capacity of 6,10,050 tonnes per annum of polyester staple fibre, filament yarn, draw texturized yarn, fully drawn yarn and textile grade chips.
