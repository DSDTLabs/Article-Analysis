NEW  : You can now get an   view of the capital, with   all set to start regular ‘Delhi Darshan’ chopper flights from its Rohini heliport from April 1.

 A 20-minute ride for Rs 4,999 will go over Pitampura Tower, Majnu Ka Tila, Red Fort, Rajghat, Akshardham Temple and the neighbouring areas. There will also be a 10-minute ride for Rs 2,499. “Pawan Hans is starting helicopter rides from the Rohini heliport. Initially, the helicopter ride/Delhi Darshan was planned for this weekend. Regular rides will start from April 1,” the state-run chopper PSU said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the tickets for these can be booked online at www.pawanhans.co.in
 
 The choppers will only go till Akshardham as the approach path of three runways of Delhi Airport start beyond that. A small heliport near the temple has been in the works for years.
 
 This is the first time that Delhiites will be able to take chopper rides in the  . Till now, flying in and out of Delhi in choppers has been restricted to VVIPs or the uber rich. Even the rich find it tough to get a slot for chopper movement at the congested Delhi airport. Top dignitaries like the president, PM and home minister use Safdarjung Airport as a heliport. 
 
 Pawan Hans will begin chopper flights from the Rohini Heliport to nearby places. Private chopper operators will also be allowed to do so from this facility.
