New Delhi: A day after   president   stoked a controversy with his remarks on Lord Krishna while criticising the ‘anti-Romeo’ drive in Uttar Pradesh, former Delhi   chief Satish Upadhyay called him a “Naxalite”.

 Upadhyay tweeted on Monday, “Dolt @pbhushan1 shud’nt b allowed to get away after outraging religious feelings of Hindus. High time v set an example for Naxalite-like him (Bhushan).”
 
 Though Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Bagga filed a complaint against Bhushan on Sunday, Upadhyay said he too would file a complaint. “It is high time we teach such people a lesson as they are damaging our culture and hurting religious sentiments. I come from Brij area. I’m deeply hurt by his statement,” said Upadhyay.
 
 On Sunday, Bhushan tweeted, “Romeo loved just one lady, while Krishna was a legendary eve-teaser. Would (UP CM Yogi) Adityanath have the guts to call his vigilantes Anti-Krishna squads?”
 
 Bhushan later tweeted, “My tweet on Romeo brigade being distorted. My position is: By the logic of Romeo Brigade, even Lord Krishna would look like eve-teaser,” he tweeted. “We have grown up with legends of young Krishna teasing Gopis. The logic of Romeo squad would criminalise this. Didn’t intend to hunt sentiments.”
 
 Slamming Bhushan, Upadhyay said, “Like Naxalites who are involved in anti-national activities, Bhushan is attacking and insulting our culture.”
 
 Supporting the UP government’s initiative of the anti-Romeo squad, he said, “Is it bad to have a squad which will check eve-teasing and ensure women’s safety? Just to make a point for political gain, can he say whatever he wants to?”
