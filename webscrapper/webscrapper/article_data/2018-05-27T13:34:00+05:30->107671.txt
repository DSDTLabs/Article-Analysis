THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KPCC president M M Hassan said it is high time the BJP is renamed as  . Accusing it of following the divisive agenda similar to that of the erstwhile British administration in India, Hassan said the   government is making the lives of Indian citizens miserable day-byday.

 He was inaugurating the Raj Bhavan march organized by the KPCC as part of the nationwide observance of betrayal day to mark the fourth anniversary of Modi government. “High inflation, steep hike in petrol and diesel prices, demonetisation, implementation of GST, etc., have completely broken the backbone of the Indian economy. The postal department is shut down as employees protest wrong moves of the government. ‘Acche Din’ is only for the corporates and oil merchants. For the layman, the past four years have been days of depression and struggles. Even in such a situation, Modi government is busy spending around Rs 530 crore for advertisements alone”, said Hassan. KPCC leaders Rajmohan Unnithan, Thampanoor Ravi, Palode Ravi, Neyyatinkara Sanal, Varkala Kahar, PA Salim and   led Raj Bhavan the march.
 
 Former chief minister   posed a set of eight questions to Modi as part of betrayal day campaign. Chandy wanted a clarification on petrol – diesel price hike, devaluation of Indian currency and the promise of recovering black money. He also challenged Modi to publish details of Make in India programme. “How much investment has been attracted? How many people got employment?” Chandy asked.
 
 The set of questions was concluded with the query on the status of much publicised   promise by Modi.
