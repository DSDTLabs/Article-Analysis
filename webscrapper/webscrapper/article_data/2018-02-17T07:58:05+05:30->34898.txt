NEW DELHI: The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) is holding an emergency meeting in the Capital on Saturday to help the "affected banks" settle their dues with Punjab National Bank ( ), which is at the centre of a Rs 11,300-crore fraud.

 
 Banks have been fighting over who will bear the liability of funds extended to   and  's outfits, based on forged letters of undertakings (LoUs) issued by PNB. Although the fraud came to light late last month, payment concerns arose earlier this week after the Delhi-headquartered lender scaled up the size of the scam, which was allegedly masterminded by a junior executive at a branch in Mumbai.
 
 Allahabad Bank, Union Bank and Axis Bank were among those which had extended funds, estimated at around Rs 7,000 crore, to the accused entities but most of it has now been sold to other banks. In addition, official sources told TOI that lenders have also extended loans of around Rs 7,000 crore to Nirav Modi's companies, which run the risk of turning non-performing if they remain unpaid for 90 days in a row.
 
 While other banks, that provided funding based on fraud guarantees, have been demanding that PNB "honour its commitment", the country's third-largest lender is holding firm that others should have done "due diligence" before extending payment facilities. The assets seized by the enforcement directorate as well as properties that have been provisionally attached by the tax department will help the government generate some funds and enable banks to realise some of the money that seems to have been lost.
 
 Although some provisioning will be required, PNB executives said that if needed, funds would be set aside till the June quarter, when the fraud LoUs mature.
