MARGAO:   MLA Churchill Alemao on Tuesday said that he supported the demand made by villagers of Benaulim and   for a road on stilts for the stretch of the Western Bypass passing through these two villages.

 Alemao told reporters that the locals have rejected the revised plan of the western bypass passing through Benaulim and Seraulim which included construction of culverts to allow free flow of rainwater. 
 
 Stating that culverts or small bridges would not be enough to prevent flooding of the low-lying areas, Alemao said that he would now push for dredging of Sal river and fortifying its banks.
 
 “At one time, the depth of the river was about the height of a coconut tree. Now, with so much silt depositing on its bed, one can easily wade through the hardly waist-deep waters of the river. The huge growth of mangroves on either side of the river has further narrowed its width,” Alemao said.
 
 The contractor of the project, Alemao said, has been told to stop work on the project until the plan is further revised to construct the nearly 3km bypass stretch passing through these two villages on stilts. 
 
 Chief minister  , during his visit to the area , along with Alemao and TCP minister Vijai Sardesai, had reassured the people that the plan would be redesigned to have “small bridge like structures” to ensure that no flooding takes place.
