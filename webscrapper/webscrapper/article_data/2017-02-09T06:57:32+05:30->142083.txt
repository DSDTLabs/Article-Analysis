 The finance department then issued an ad-interim order for the property attachment in January and forwarded the matter for necessary action to  , who is the competent authority under   (OPID) Act.
 
 According to the law, a petition before the designated court has been filed for making the ad-interim order absolute and direction to sell the attached property by public auction. Hearing on the petition will start soon, said government counsel  . The petitioner has prayed for public auction so that sale proceeds can be distributed among the duped investors. 
 
 This is the second petition filed for attachment of Hi-Tech group's properties. Earlier, a petition praying for attachment of offices of the group in Bhubaneswar, nearly 146 acres of land and 53 bank accounts, is sub-judice in the designated court.
