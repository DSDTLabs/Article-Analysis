Former   singer   says she had to delay her second album 'Chapter Two' because of a   case. 

 The 27-year-old pop beauty has revealed the track 'Trust' is about snaky people in the   business and how she had to cut some songs from the mini album, which is expected to drop this spring, because of a sticky situation, which she is not allowed to speak about for legal reasons. 
 
  
  
 "There were certain songs I loved that I couldn't use any more. So I've basically had to start again, which is why it's taken this long." 
 
 It didn't stop the singer, who had planned on dropping the follow-up to 2016's 'Chapter One' last summer, writing about what happened and by putting her anger and emotions into her songs she feels stronger mentally now. 
 
 "The   lining is it's given me something to write about. I'm in a much better position now, mentally. I used to get so scared of going in the studio with people I didn't know but now, you could put me anywhere and I'd be fine."
