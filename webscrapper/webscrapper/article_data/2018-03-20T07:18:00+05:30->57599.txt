Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday granted bail to former Punjab minister Sucha Singh   in the rape case registered against him at Gurdaspur police station. Allowing Langahâ€™s bail plea, Justice Lisa Gill, however, made it clear that the senior Shiromani Akali Dal leader shall not travel abroad without permission from the court.

 Langah was booked on September 29, 2017 following a police complaint by a local woman accusing him of raping her repeatedly since 2009. He was booked on charges of rape, extortion, cheating and criminal intimidation. The complainant had also given a 20-minute video clip in pen drive to the police to support her accusations. He was arrested in October 2017.
 
 In his bail plea, Langah mainly argued that there was a delay of nine years in the registration of case against him. He had also submitted that the case was an outcome of political vendetta and to keep him away from the politics. During the hearing of the case, the HC was also informed that the complainant had not supported the case during trial. The complainant had backtracked from her allegations on February 28.
 
 Langah had been claiming that he along with others leaders of the party had given a detailed representation to the Punjab DGP against the false implication of Akalis at the behest of Congress MLAs and provided with a list of more than 200 hundred cases in Gurdaspur district alone. He had also claimed that the present FIR was registered to keep him away from the election campaign of Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat. Even in this FIR, the complainant is an employee of police department and the entire conspiracy was hatched by some local leaders and police officials, Langah had argued.
