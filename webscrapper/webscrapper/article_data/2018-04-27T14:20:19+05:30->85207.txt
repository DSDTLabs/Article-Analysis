PATNA: Even after surge in the number of online portals offering different genre of books, the trend of visiting libraries, publication houses or stores is still popular among Patnaites.

 “We have a wide collection of English and Hindi books on Gandhian philosophy, sports, science and technology, media and communication, among others. Our annual sales target is Rs 25 lakh, but we end up selling books worth Rs 35 lakh. This clearly indicates that a large number of Patnaites are into reading,” A B  , the in-charge of a city-based outlet of  , told this reporter on Wednesday.
 
 The Publications Division — a media unit of the Union ministry of information and broadcasting — is one of the leading publishing houses in the country.
 
 According to local shopkeepers, novels and competitive exam books are in demand among youngsters, but the sale of academic textbooks has witnessed a gradual fall in the last few years.
 
 “After Class X, students hardly buy textbooks as they prefer studying online. Those, who come here, either buy used books or sell old ones at half the purchasing price. We, in turn, give them away to new customers at 75% rates,” Vivek Ranjan, a shopkeeper selling used books near Gandhi Maidan, said.
 
 Ram Naresh Yadav, the owner of another book store at Gandhi Maidan, pointed out, “Gone are the days when students bought textbooks. Now, they only come for competitive books and guides to pass exams.”
