Hyderabad: Senior Congress party leader   on Friday accused the state government of diverting Central funds meant for 'input subsidy' for farmers. 

 Digvijaya Singh, the   general secretary, also the in-charge of the party affairs in  , told media here that the state government neglected farmers' welfare and that of other sections of society in the last 33 months. The government failed to come to the rescue of farmers even though severe drought conditions and acute shortage of water had hit agricultural activity. He said the Congress would launch an agitation to highlight the state government's failure in mitigating the suffering of farmers, weavers, artisans and daily wage earners. He said the Congress was not against irrigation projects but the party was opposed to misuse of public money to benefit contractors. Referring to attacks on Indians in USA, Digvijaya said there has been an increase in the number of hate related incidents after   became the President.
