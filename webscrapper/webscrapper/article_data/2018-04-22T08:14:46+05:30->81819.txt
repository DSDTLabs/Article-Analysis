DHARAMSHALA: Normalcy has still not returned to villages of   constituency in   district even after so many days of the tragic school bus accident in which 23 children of this area were killed. Most of the shops still remain closed, children parks wear an abandoned look, streets remain empty and the nearby school strength also remains thin.

 On April 9, a school bus carrying 37 passengers was on its way to drop children at their homes but it fell into a deep gorge, killing most of the passengers. Wazir Ram Singh Pathania School, where the victims used to study, has been lying closed since then.
 
 “There is no such custom, but people are not opening shops. Evenings in this village have become dull as not many children come to play in the park. Things are getting a bit out of control. Empty streets give more pain to villagers,” said Indu Kumari, pradhan of Thed panchayat. Khuwara, Thed, Phangota, Har and Lahg were the villages of Thed panchayat from where most of the children died. One student each was from Kanota and Palah villages adjacent to this panchayat.
 
 “Things have become tougher for us now as relatives and friends who were here for the last many days were leaving now. Emptiness in the streets and homes is troubling us” said Swaran Pathania, a relative of a victim. Worst hit are grandparents and mothers of victims. A deafening silence prevails in Khuwara village, which lost a maximum 14 children. The girl who was going to marry on May 11 was also from this village.
