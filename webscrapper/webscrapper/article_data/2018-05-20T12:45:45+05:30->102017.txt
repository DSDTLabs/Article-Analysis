GAYA: Magadh division commissioner Jitendra Srivastav has ordered issuance of show-cause notices to 178 government   of primary health centres (PHCs), additional PHCs and other district and subdivision-level hospitals of the division’s five districts for their casual approach to work. They allegedly examined less than 320 outdoor patients in April.

 The performance of the doctors and paramedical staff came for scrutiny during a division-level review meeting held on Friday. Commissioner Srivastav reviewed the performance of the doctors on 20 different aspects of healthcare, including patient or attendant satisfaction, neonatal care, award of maternity benefits and availability of medicines, among others.
 
 The maximum number of show-cause recipients (65) are from Gaya district. Besides, 38 doctors from  , 36 from  , 28 from Aurangabad and 11 doctors from Arwal district have also been served the show-cause notices.
 
 Sources said the commissioner disapprovingly noted the shortcomings of the   roster. Several PHC heads and district- level medical officers responsible for duty distribution kept themselves away from OPD work. The commissioner directed them to include themselves in the roster at least two days a week.
 
 Sources said while 127 doctors were found to have examined less than 320 patients in one month, two doctors — Dr Arvind Kumar (Arwal) and Dr Raghavendra Narain (Aurangabad) — examined whopping 3,043 and 2,371 patients respectively during the period.
 
 Commissioner Srivastav said he has directed the civil surgeons of Arwal and Aurangabad to personally verify the claims and see to it that the doctors maintain the OPD protocol.
 
 The sources said it was also noticed during the meeting that records were not properly updated. The commissioner also expressed unhappiness over the failure to upload relevant information to the department website. Officials concerned were directed to ensure the availability of medicines in government hospitals.
