KOLHAPUR: Over two months after Centre’s   move, the Kolhapur grain   — one of biggest markets in South Maharashtra and Kokan region — is limping its way back to normalcy.

 Following demonetisation, the market’s daily turnover was reduced to half owing to cash crunch and reduced demand. The daily truck ferries had reduced from 50 to 20 and daily turnover reduced by 50%.
 
 Giving information about the current scenario, former president of   Vaibhav Savrdekar said, “Demonetisation ruined our business. Now, we are slowly returning to normalcy. Almost 70% of the business has returned to pre-demonetisation period. The demand for   has increased and the rates of pulses have gone down in last weeks which attracted many customers in the city and rural Kolhapur. Despite this, there is still little slack in the market.”
 
 When asked about implementation of cashless mode of transactions he replied, “The customers are interested in paying bills through cashless system. But there is a state of confusion over responsibility of extra charges over online bills. Therefore, the rate of installation of Point of Sale (POS) terminals is not high among traders.”
 
 Another trader in market said, “The consumer flow has begun after a long gap. Now, there is enough cash to cater the needs of others. Even the demand from Kokan region has resumed. But the sudden decision threw us in danger for a while. After two months nobody is discussing cashless economy, POS machines and paperless transactions.”
