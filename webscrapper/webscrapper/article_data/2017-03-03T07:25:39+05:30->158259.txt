JAIPUR: The assembly on Thursday witnessed an uproar over properties of the erstwhile royal families in the state during  .

 As the debate led to chaos and the Opposition pointing fingers at the state government,   ruled and struck the entire discussion on the basis that several matters related to such properties were sub-judice. 
 
 “'Matters which are in the court are not to be discussed here and the state government needed no reply to related queries,” said Meghwal.
 
 The question related to details of such properties was raised by Independent MLA Hanuman Beniwal. 
 
 Replying to it, parliamentary affairs minister Rajasthan Rathore said, while government had a list of such properties and by an order dated September 26, 2012, formed the Khanna committee to look into the property disputes of the royal family of Jaipur, but it was yet to submit its report, several were in the courts. 
 
 Beniwal then raised the issue of a property owned by the erstwhile royal family of Jaipur. This was followed by an uproar and the Opposition trying to corner the government over a recent controversy. 
 
 Beniwal, while interacting with the media persons later, said that it was unfortunate he was not allowed to raise the Raj Mahal Palace Hotel issue. “'The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) was forced to take action and seal the gates of the hotel. I was demanding why such a decision was taken and then why was it revoked but was not allowed to raise as it government has no answers,” he claimed.
 
 Senior BJP leader Ghanshyam Tiwari too had objected to Speaker not allowing a discussions. “According to rules, matters which are in the courts, cannot be discussed. However, this was about administrative action and it being revoked later. That can be definitely discussed in the house,” he said later.
 
 BJP MLA Diya Kumari, who belongs to the erstwhile royal family of Jaipur, was also present in the House.
