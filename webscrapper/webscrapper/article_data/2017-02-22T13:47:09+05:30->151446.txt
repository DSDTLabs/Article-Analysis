Lucknow: There must be few things as painful as parting with a pet for reasons of extreme poverty. As you travel towards Manikpur through Gopipur, Sariayan, Tikariya, Dadri and Madaiyan villages, one sees herds of cows and oxen being driven towards the  .

 Poverty and drought have not only forced farmers to migrate but also led to their selling livestock to bordering state  . Munna, a farmer of MP who entered UP to buy cattle in Bundelkhand, told TOI, “We have been sent here to buy excess livestock from poor farmers and take them to Rewa district of MP. The government there has announced giving two bulls, a bullock cart and a plough at subsidised rates to famers living below poverty line.”
 
 Since there is extreme poverty in   and thousands of cattle die here every year, farmers dispose of their cattle to the government of MP. Nathuniya, a famer of Manikpur says, “We can’t see our cattle dying of drought and water scarcity. Just see the barren farms of our village. They are full of carcasses of cows. Selling them would at least save their lives and fetch us some money to survive.” 
 
 Livestock population in Bundelkhand was once more than its human population but after 1980s the livestock started declining because of frequent droughts and lack of green pastures. Suresh, a farmer of Gopipur said, “Cows die here every day and we have no place to dispose of their bodies. Apart from Bundelkhand package, there is hardly any fund being allocated to develop animal shelter homes or give at least funds for fodder. Farmers here have been selling off their livestock to MP government since last few years but UP government has never understood our plight.”
