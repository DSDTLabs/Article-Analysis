NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old man was killed in an alleged   bid in northwest Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar early on Friday. The man was stabbed several times and died during treatment.

 Around 1.30am, the PCR received a call from a passerby informing about a man lying in a pool of blood. Before police arrived at the spot, the victim’s relative and colleagues rushed him to   from where he was referred to Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital. He was later sent to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he died due to excessive bleeding.
 
 The victim,  , worked at a petrol pump barely a few kilometres away from his house. He had gone to buy tea from a stall near the pump when the incident took place. By then the fuel pump had been closed and only a few of his colleagues were there. When he didn’t return for some time, his colleagues went looking for him. They soon found him lying in a pool of blood with stab wounds in his abdomen.
 
 DCP (northwest)   said a team has been formed to investigate the case. An officer said that they have some clues about the perpetrators from CCTV footage from the route that Kumar took to get to the tea stall.
