THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala state sports council president   will face an uphill task if he wants to continue as the president of the council as the   has asked the   bureau (VACB) to go ahead with the  . 

 VACB had submitted the   with Dasan as the first accused on Friday, on which the court asked the agency to go ahead with the probe on Saturday. With a case registered against him, the demand for him to step down will come from various quarters soon. This is likely to be a major setback for the government as Dasan is CPM's senior leader from Kozhikode.
 
 VACB had found that several crores of rupees were earned through the sales of sports lottery programme during the previous LDF government's tenure when Dasan held the portfolio of president of the council. But the probe found that no money was spent for the development of sports in the state, which was the aim of the project.
 
 The probe was launched when former president Anju Bobby George, who had to relinquish the post unceremoniously, wrote an open letter to the then industries and sports minister E P Jayarajan challenging him to bring out the irregularities in the council over the past 10 years.
