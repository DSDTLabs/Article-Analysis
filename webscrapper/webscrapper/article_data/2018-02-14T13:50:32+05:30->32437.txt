COIMBATORE: Former vice-chancellor of Bharathiar University A   will be lodged in a ‘Class A’ prison cell, according to an order by the special court for DVAC cases in the city on Tuesday. 

 The order follows VC’s petition before the chief judicial magistrate seeking to lodge him in a ‘Class A’ prison cell on Saturday. When the petition came up for hearing before judge   on Tuesday, he recommended the collector to lodge Ganapathi in a ‘Class A’ cell. 
 
 Earlier, Ganapathi’s counsel argued that the vice-chancellor was a tax-payer and also an academically important man who had guided around 30 PhD scholars. “This merited him a Class A prison cell,” the counsel said. 
 
 Countering this, the public prosecutor said Ganapathi had not mentioned in his petition what he lacked in his present cell. He added that those arrested in graft cases should not be provided with Class A cells. The judge, however, ordered that Ganapathi be provided with a ‘Class A’ cell.
 
 A Class A prison cell will have a table, chair, cot and a TV. The inmate would be provided with daily newspapers, quality food thrice a day and purified drinking water. Currently, Ganapathi is in police custody. When the custody ends on February 16, he would be sent back to prison, where the authorities would lodge him in a Class A cell.
