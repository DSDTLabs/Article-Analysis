TIRUPUR: Animal husbandry minister   on Friday laid the foundation stone for Tamil Nadu’s second poultry disease diagnostic and surveillance laboratory (Pddsl) at   here. The   Veterinary and Animal Sciences University-run facility will also house an animal feed analytical and quality assurance laboratory (Afaqal).

 With 4,207 hatcheries and 52 broiler farms, Palladam is one of the major poultry hubs in the state. Thousands of people depend on the local poultry industry. The Palladam-based broiler co-ordination committee fix the local as well as international price of broiler chicken.
 
 The industry is prone to diseases. Reports of bird flu, even in other states, bring down broiler prices. At such times, broilers should be tested periodically for diagnosis and intervention. “Presently, disease samples from Palladam have to be taken to Namakkal Pddsl for diagnosis. That’s why the government decided to set up another lab in Palladam,” said joint director of animal husbandry in the district R Rengasamy.
 
 “Another major problem the poultry industry faces is price increase of poultry feed and its quality. Since poultry farms are producing the feed, it is difficult to ensure that it is nutritious. That’s why the government decided to set up Pddsl and feed analytical lab on a 4.92-acre plot in Palladam at a cost of Rs 5.92 crore,” said Radhakrishnan.
 
 The government got financial assistance from the   (NADP) and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) for the project. While the government has roped in the   (Nddb) to provide expertise to build the twin labs, the broiler co-ordination committee has come forward to construct the compound wall at a cost of Rs 21 lakh.
