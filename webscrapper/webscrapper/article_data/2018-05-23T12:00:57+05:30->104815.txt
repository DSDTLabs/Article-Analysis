ASANSOL: The carcass controversy in Bengal will have its impact during Bangladesh prime minister  's visit to   on Saturday. The university will award Hasina a DLitt degree in its third convocation. The university has prepared a special lunch for the visiting head of state, which will incidentally have neither chicken or mutton. While it isn't clear whether the Bangladeshi premier would eat at all, given the fasting month of Ramzan, all arrangements are being made. 

 Burdwan's famous sweets mihidana and sitabhog and Krishnagar's sarpuria and sar bhaja have found their place in the menu. The university officials are shy to keep hilsa in the menu due to the lack of good-quality hilsa in Bengal. The special menu for the Bangladesh prime minister, therefore, will only have fish from Bengal.
 
  University vice-chancellor Sadhan Chakraborty said, "After the recent carcass meat controversy, we are not keeping chicken or mutton on the special menu for the Bangladeshi PM."
 
 A special memento, a muslin sari and other university memorabilia will be presented to Hasina. There will be an engraved photograph of her on the specially ordered memento. Both will be purchased from Biswa Bangla stall.
 
 While Governor Keshari Nath Tripathy, the university chancellor, will be present, the university officials said they were awaiting Nabanna's confirmation on whether chief minister Mamata Banerjee and education minister Partha Chatterjee would attend the programme on Saturday. The Governor will award the DLitt to Hasina.
