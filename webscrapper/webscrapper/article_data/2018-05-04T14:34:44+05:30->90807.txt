NEW DELHI:  's   chief minister   today said in Bengaluru that the Congress will easily win the upcoming   on its own and won't need to ally with the JD(S) or anyone else.

 
 He was speaking at a Times Now-Vijay Karnataka conclave titled 'Karnataka now: Seize the moment', organised to discuss the upcoming Assembly polls, and the issues and candidates involved.
 
 He added that he isn't at all worried about Narendra Modi's recent fulsome praise for the JD(S) chief Deve Gowda and dismissed it as nothing but a gimmick aimed to create a divide. It won't at all affect the Congress's chances in the May 12 assembly polls, he said.
 
 
 
 
 Siddaramaiah said he's confident of the Congress retaining the state with a comfortable majority because the BJP and PM Modi have made no contribution to the development of Karnataka. 
 
 "PM has not released funds to us even though we had two severe droughts. There has been no help from the Government of India. I sent a multi-party delegation to PM and he didn't respond. What has he done for Karnataka? He could not even find a solution to the Mahadayi river issue," said Siddaramaiah, referring to a water-sharing dispute with Goa.
 
 
 
 
 When asked why he is contesting from two seats, the chief minister said that people of North Karnataka wanted him to contest from the second constituency of Badami - in addition to the constituency of Chamundeshwari - as it would give a positive message to other constituencies.
 
 "I am 100 percent confident I will win from both seats with a comfortable margin," said Siddaramaiah.
 
 
 
 
 About BJP criticism that he was trying to play safe by contesting from two seats, he reminded the audience that Modi, too, contested not just from Varanasi but also from Vadodara in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
