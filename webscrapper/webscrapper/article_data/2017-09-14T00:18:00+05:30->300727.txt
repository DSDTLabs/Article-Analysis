Chandigarh: The Panjab University student bodies are contemplating to bring a no-confidence motion against the newly-elected Panjab University Campus Student Council (PUCSC). According to Panjab University norms for the PUCSC, if two-thirds of the department representatives (DRs) and executive DRs give no-confidence motion, it can nullify the elected council. This year, 124 DRs got elected and five executive DRs will be elected on Thursday. “We have around 50 DRs and SFS has 20 DRs, so we are going to bring in the no-confidence motion against the elected council. We are holding meetings with other student outfits to proceed further,” said senior PUSU leader Satwinder Singh Naval. He added the reason was “this council has been elected by the authorities and not students.
