KOLKATA: Days after investigators prayed before a special Pocso court in   for test identification (TI) parade in the sexual abuse cases in two city schools last year, the police are yet to complete the formalities in the   case. Tuesday was one of the proposed dates to carry out the TI parade initially. The second high court hearing in this case is scheduled this week.

 According to the girl’s family members, she was instead taken to the school during the winter break and asked to identify the accused   (44), the school peon, from a photograph. Parents of the three-and-a-halfyear-old girl accompanied her.
 
 Police claimed the probe was on track. “The TI parade will take place eventually. We took her to the school to identify the place of occurrence and reconstruct the chain of events,” said an officer.
 
 “A TI parade needs to conform to certain legal parameters. The school exercise, therefore, cannot be termed a parade as such,” said an advocate. Police had earlier hinted that they had fixed a date to carry out the TI parade. On Tuesday, though, her maternal uncle said he had not heard of any such plan from the police so far.
 
  
  Incidentally, the girl was taken to the school days after the high court asked Behala police to file a report on the progress of investigation. The order followed a submission by the kid’s father that the case was not being probed properly and a counter-claim by police that there was no evidence to warrant a second arrest.
 
 Earlier, police had moved a separate application in the special Pocso court in Alipore asking for the TI parade of accused Manna. The court had granted the plea. The police also got the confidential statement of the victim’s parents recorded before a magistrate accordingly. The girl’s confidential statement was recorded almost three months ago.
 
 The  , though, in 2016 had ruled that TI was not necessary in a sexual offence case.
