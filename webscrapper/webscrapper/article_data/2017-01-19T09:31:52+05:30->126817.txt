NAGPUR: Former Congress chief minister   on Wednesday condemned party MLA   for felicitating vandals who had thrown the statue of playwright   into a river. “Gadkari was an asset for entire Maharashtra. It is wrong to dishonour him,” Chavan told the media while replying to a query on Rane. Gadkari had spent some time at Saoner in Nagpur district, and passed away there.

 Gadkari’s statue had been vandalized on January 4 at a park on Jangli Maharaj Road, Pune. Four persons removed a bust of the littérateur and threw it into the Mutha river nearby. The four were workers of the Sambhaji Brigade and Swabhiman Sanghatana.
 
 The bust was later retrieved by police and civic body workers. The statue was reinstalled amid a heated debate.
 
 Nitesh Rane, who is also president of Swabhiman Sanghatana, on Monday felicitated the four men. The politician also openly announced that the act had probably taken place at his instigation. The four were felicitated at a ceremony at Tulapur village, some 40km from Pune. The programme was organized on the eve of 337th anniversary of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj’s coronation, and Rane was the chief guest. Ever since Narayan Rane’s decline in politics, the Maratha leader and his two sons have taken a hardline stand on the Maratha community’s issues.
