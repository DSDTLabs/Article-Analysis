 A multi-fold oxygen unit and pipeline have also been set up in the hospital for continuous supply of oxygen in all wards of IGIMS. The skill development lab has been built in an area of 4,000 square feet at a cost of Rs140 crore where paramedics, nurses and doctors would receive training pertaining to their specialized fields.

 The new fully airconditioned library has seating arrangements for 500 students.
