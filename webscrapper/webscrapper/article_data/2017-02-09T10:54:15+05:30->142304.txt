BENGALURU: Church Street will remain closed,   and essential   from Friday. BBMP is taking up upgradation of the 715-metre stretch at a cost of Rs 9.02 crore. 

 Officials said the work is likely to hinder traffic movement and lead to snarls if the road is not closed. Commercial establishments on the street will be allowed to remain open. City development minister   had earlier said the work will get over in six months. 
 
 Basavaraj Kabade, executive engineer, Traffic Engineering Cell, BBMP, said the work will start in phases soon. "We are likely to start from KC Das end till Empire Hotel junction. The work between this junction and   junction will be taken up later. The last phase will be from Rest House Cross Road to Brigade Road junction. Old service utilities have to be replaced with newer ones," he said. 
 
 People using the stretch will have to put up with many inconveniences, as utilities like sanitation lines, other pipes, the footpath and road itself will have to be relaid on road as per TenderSURE guidelines, as was done in case of St Marks Road and Cunnigham Road.
 
 The revamped street will have a 5.50 metre wide carriageway. There will be 10 parking bays for both two-wheelers and four-wheelers.
