NAVI MUMBAI: Fifteen   have allegedly got   engineering degrees from an unregistered Rajasthan university, a city activist has complained to the top civic officials. 

 Anarjit Chauhan has demanded an inquiry into the issue. “Over the last 10 months, I had been seeking information through RTI as to how certain   employees had managed to get BTech degrees through distance education learning from a Rajasthan-based university. After going through the RTI documents, and also consulting other education experts, I was surprised to find out that the said university was not even registered by   (AICTE). The civic employees had somehow managed to get the degrees between 2010 to 2012 only to get promotions in NMMC,” the activist said. 
 
 The name of the Rajasthan-based college, which offered the degrees, has allegedly been mentioned in a misleading abbreviation, to sound similar to another college. NMMC chief N Ramaswami told TOI, “I have received Chauhan’s complaint and have forwarded the same to the administration department for an inquiry.” 
 
 When asked what action could be taken if the allegations are found to be true, Ramaswami said: “Departmental action can be taken if the complaint about the alleged fake degrees is found to be true. If required, a police case can also be lodged. We will have to wait for the administration to complete the inquiry.”
 
 Meanwhile, Chauhan has also demanded that there should be a time-bound probe into the issue so that the matter is not inordinately delayed. “All staffers concerned and even those who may have deliberately avoided looking into the   scam must be punished after the inquiry is done,” he said. That there should be a reliable verification process to check if any education degree acquired from out of the state is genuine or not, the activist added.
 
 Deputy municipal commissioner (admin) Kiranraj Yadav, he said, “I have just joined this department and I cannot immediately comment on the issue.”
