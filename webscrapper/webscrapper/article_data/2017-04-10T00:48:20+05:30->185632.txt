NEW DELHI:   chief   kickstarted the campaign for the April 23 civic polls with a ‘Vijay Vikas Yatra’ from South Moti Bagh on Sunday. Tiwari promised to improve conditions across all wards in the capital and said his party would focus on the poor if voted back to office. 

 He was accompanied by MP Meenakshi Lekhi as the road show covered different wards under R K Puram, Malviya Nagar, Kasturba Nagar and Greater Kailash assembly constituencies.
 
 Perched atop the “Vikas Yatra” van bearing posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Delhi BJP chief himself, Tiwari told people that the party wanted to redevelop and improve the capital in accordance with the Prime Minister’s vision and provide the poor with greater support in terms of education and sanitation.
 
 “There are a lot of problems in the city that can be worked on and we want to develop it in accordance with PM Modi’s vision and dream. We are with the poor and the party is committed to uplifting and improving conditions for everyone,” he said, while addressing a crowd in RK Puram.
 
 Tiwari took potshots at both Congress and AAP, saying Ajay Maken and Arvind Kejriwal were frustrated with people showing more affection towards BJP. “People of Delhi fully understand the political realities now and will reject Kejriwal-Maken and elect BJP for all-round development of the city. As Pradesh president, I promise to provide best services to the people of Delhi through the municipal corporations,” Tiwari said at Safdarjung Enclave. 
 
 He said Maken and Kejriwal were trying to mislead people by promising unrealistic/free schemes. Lekhi sought to remind people of the work done by BJP in the past.
