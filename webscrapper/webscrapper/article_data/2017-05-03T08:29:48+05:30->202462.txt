UDUPI: It is vacation time and there is good demand for   in  . However, promoters are struggling to get a helipad to operate the copters. As a result, heli-tourism which was to start from April this year, is yet to take off. 

 The district administration, along with  , started chopper service in 2016. The promoter was allowed to use the   helipad at Adi-Udupi. But this time, NSS authorities have denied permission to use their helipad for commercial purpose.
 
 Sudeesh, a heli-tourism promoter said, “As heli-tourism will play a major role in Udupi, the district administration is trying its best to provide us a helipad. The authorities had identified the playground at Beedinagudde for the purpose. But the councillors of Udupi objected to it as the grounds come under   limits.”
 
 Now, the administration has shown company representatives another site at Manapalla to use as a helipad, he added.
 
 “We wanted a no-objection letter from the   and the district administration to start heli-tourism at the site. If locals raise opposition once a chopper is called and service started, we will be in trouble. With vacations on there is a demand for the service. This will fall once schools start and the monsoon begins. I am struggling to start the service. Heli-tourism will only promote tourism,” he added.
 
 Narasimha Nayak, councilor for Manipal ward said, “The latest site is near Manapalla. I object to the proposed site as it is a residential area. People will complain of disturbance caused by helicopters. Besides, the area chosen by the administration is a playground for children.”
 
 Manjunathaiah, council commissioner, said, “I had informed the district administration about the council’s opposition to the helipad coming up in Beedinagudde as a large number of children use the playground. The administration has now decided to construct a helipad near Mannu Palla Lake.”
