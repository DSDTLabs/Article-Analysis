AHMEDABAD: In yet another case of an alleged violation of Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostics Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, officials of the health department of   ( ), on Wednesday, sealed the sonography machine at Karuna Trust Medical Centre in   area of the city. This is the second case of PCPNDT violation reported in the last three days and the fourth one in this year.

 After civic authorities sealed a sonography machine at a Chandkheda-based nursing home earlier this week, they conducted a random raid at nursing homes and maternity homes in different parts of the city. In this case, there was discrepancy in the forms, many of which were not signed and authorized by the gynaecologist in charge.
 
  Sharing more details,  , medical officer of health, AMC, said, “Upon checking the papers at this nursing home in Usmanpura, we learnt that in several cases, the copy of the undertaking on Form-F, which is filled in for performing sonography were not signed by the doctor in charge while some of them were not signed at all. As a consequence, we decided to seal the sonography machine.”
 
 “The discrepancy in documents doesn’t prove that illegal sex determination tests are being conducted at these nursing homes. 
 
 However, it certainly raises a suspicion of malpractices going on. Unless we initiate stringent action in the matter, the situation will not improve. Doctors must take paperwork seriously,” said Solanki.
 
 A case has been filed in the court and further action will be initiated. AMC health officials will be aggressively check paper work at maternity homes across all the wards in the city over the next couple of weeks. Earlier, such cases have been reported in Khadia, Naroda and recently this week in Chandkheda area of the city.
