LUCKNOW: The April 15 deadline for 100% cleanliness in 40 select wards of the city is ending, with the   still struggling to get its staff and private partner,   team up for a joint roster across the wards. A decision was taken in the   meeting recently to put   on track, but lack of planning has apparently delayed the exercise.

 Ecogreen, which took over the responsibility a year ago to collect garbage from all houses, transport it to the transfer stations and then treat it at   plant, has often faced flak for poor collection and cleaning of garbage from roads. People often complain that neither the company’s staff visit houses, nor do they remove garbage from dumping sites regularly.
 
 
 To monitor their activities, LMC decided to prepare a team of sanitary supervisor, workers and Ecogreen’s collector for each ward and make them visit the ward together to ensure that all cleanliness activities are performed daily — be it garbage collection from houses, cleaning of streets, attendance of workers etc. This was to be done in 5 select wards from each zone, called Adarsh Wards.
 
 Hence, total 40 wards (5 from each zone) had to achieve 100% cleanliness in two weeks (by April 15). This way, the LMC would select 40 wards every two weeks and attain complete cleanliness in them. However, problems cropped up, like lack of time with sanitary staff who also have to attend public grievance camps and meetings often, interference by private sweepers who have developed a monopoly in garbage collection and refuse to give in and most importantly, lack of corporators’ involvement.
 
 An LMC official said, “Many corporators felt that they are not given any information about the cleanliness roster. So, we have now decided to make them a party to the roster.”
