CHENNAI: In an effort to give engineering students more than a month to prepare for  ,   to join institutions of higher education and undergo internships,   has compressed the semester exam schedule.

 In the past, exam dates were spread over two months with a gap of more than four days or a week at times. This year, the controller of examinations has streamlined the schedule, reducing the interval between two exams to three days or less for  . A notification released on Monday said the semester exams would begin on April 23 and end on May 30.
  
  
 While students who joined BE, B Tech, and B Arch course in the 2017-18 academic year, will take their semester exams from May 16, those for second, third and final year are scheduled to begin on April 23.
 
 “Students are now given ample time to prepare for placements or undergo internships and industrial training,” controller of examinations   told TOI.
 
 Special efforts were made to prepare a compressed schedule for final year students since some of them would need more time to prepare for admission tests to join institutions of higher education, both locally and globally, she said. The stream-wise schedule for more than six lakh undergraduate students in 560 affiliated colleges has been uploaded on http://aucoe.annauniv.edu.
 
 
 
 
 On the flip side, however, some students felt they might need more time to prepare for core papers. “Though an interval of one or two days is enough for most papers, specialised subjects with new and complex concepts like ‘strength of materials’, ‘theory of machines’ need more time,” said a mechanical engineering student from a government college in Coimbatore on condition of anonymity.
