NAVI MUMBAI: The latest suspensions of a deputy engineer and a junior civic engineer in charge of the unfinished   school building in sector 11 where a minor boy Saurabh Chaudhari was killed after the entry gate fell on him has raised more questions and anger from residents and activists who alleged that the senior engineers and officers are being let off with mere slap on the wrists.

 “While the junior civic staff were suspended on Monday in connection to the tragic school gate accident, it is surprising that the additional city engineer, Surendra  , against whom a departmental inquiry is on is has not been suspended yet,'” said RTI activist Anarjit Chauhan.
 
 Another Koparkhairane activist,  , said, “If the topmost engineer is serious about his work, only then the juniors will do their job properly. How did the top engineer allow such delays and nearly 100% of cost escalations to take place? We are demanding a thorough inquiry.” 
 
 Former civic chief Tukaram Mundhe had ordered an audit over the cost escalations and delays. 
 
 The current   chief   N told TOI that they hope to make the school building operational in this academic year and finalize the current departmental inquiry against Patil and others. Ramaswami has also ordered a structural audit by experts from IIT-Bombay for the school building and awarded a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the family of the deceased.
 
 A group of citizens have also written to the chief justice of Bombay high court on the accidental death and the construction costs of the school building project to seek an independent probe into this matter.
