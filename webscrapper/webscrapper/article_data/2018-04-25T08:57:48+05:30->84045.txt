CHANDIGARH: The newly inducted ministers assumed office in the presence of chief minister   on Tuesday, who played down reports of discontent among a section of party leaders over “inadequate” representation to Dalits. Talking to mediapersons, Amarinder insisted that the Dalit community had adequate representation in the cabinet. “Not all the 77 ruling party MLAs can be made ministers, but those left out would be suitably accommodated,” he said.

  
  
 
 Replying to a question about a majority of the new ministers not having adequate qualification to head departments, he said the ministers had experienced staff to help them carry out their jobs. “A defence minister is not an Army General,” he said.
