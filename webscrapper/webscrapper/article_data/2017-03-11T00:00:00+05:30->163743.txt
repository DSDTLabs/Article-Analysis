First,   tweeted about its trailer launch and later,   also took to Twitter to congratulate   and his team for the ‘great trailer’. As the fan following of Birsa Dasgupta’s One, starring Prosenjit, Yash Dasgupta, Nusrat Jahan and Rachel White, continues to rise, we hear that   and   have recorded the film’s title track. While Arindom has composed the music, the lyrics have been penned by Prosen.
“It’s a huge honour that both Vishal and Raftaar agreed to sing title track, which is quite contemporary with a pop-rock flavour,” said the director. 
 Raftaar, who is the flavour of the season post his huge hit from Dangal, Aisi dhaakad hai, has rapped in Hindi and Vishal has sung the Bengali part. “The Bengali diction of both of them is just apt for the song, which will be shot in a jute mill on March 15,” Birsa added.
 The video of the song will feature Prosenjit, Yash and Rachel besides some other members of the cast.
 Arindom, who is pleased to have the duo on board, said, “It is a good versus bad evil duel song which will show how Prosenjit 
 and Yash strive to be the best. The punchline of the song is — bhenge jete pari tobu mochkai na, I am the one.”
