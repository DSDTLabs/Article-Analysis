They have courted controversy and taken on political heavyweights, unmindful of the consequences. Now former police officer Anupama Shenoy, Prema Kumari,   alias ‘Nurse’ Jayalakshmi and Vijayalakshmi are set to take on politicians in the electoral fray and are expected to put up a tough fight.

 
 Denied tickets from mainstream political parties, these women have found other platforms; one of them will contest as an independent. Prema Kumari and Vijayalakshmi are likely to contest against the very leaders they took on.
 
 While Shenoy had accused   minister PT Parameshwara Naik of pressuring her, Prema Kumari accused   MLA SA Ramdas of sexual harassment. Jayalakshmi was in news after she alleged BJP leader MP   was harassing her, while Vijalakshmi’s name figured in a sex CD case allegedly involving Congress MLA H Y Meti, who has since been given a clean chit.
 
 Vijayalakshmi has said she will contest against Meti from Bagalkot while Prema Kumari said she will take on Ramdas, who is likely to be the BJP candidate from Krishnaraja.
 
 Shenoy has floated a party and released a list of 15 candidates. Jayalakshmi has sought an MEP ticket from Chamarajpet.
