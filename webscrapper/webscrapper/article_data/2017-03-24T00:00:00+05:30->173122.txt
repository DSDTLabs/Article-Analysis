It’s summer, and with holidays just around the corner, it is the perfect time for the whole family to enjoy a film together that will strike a chord with each member. And this is what Hombale Film’s   promises to offer. The film hits theatres today and producer   says, “Raajakumara is an out-and-out family entertainer. It is a film about bonding and the need to respect elders, which we have portrayed in a commercial manner. It is about moments, and will leave audiences nostalgic. Although the late   doesn’t come onscreen, his ideologies and values will come alive in this movie.”

 Director   adds, “As it is a wholesome family entertainer, it is the perfect movie for summer. It will appeal to audiences of all age groups. The movie is dedicated to all those who love their parents and are carrying out their duty of caring for them.” What one must also look out for in the film, says Santhosh, is the large star cast — one will get to see almost all well-known   stars in a single frame in this movie.
