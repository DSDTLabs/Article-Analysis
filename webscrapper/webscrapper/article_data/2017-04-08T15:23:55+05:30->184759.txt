  Bareilly: Several taxi drivers have complained to the district magistrate that they have a harrowing time commuting on the outskirts of Bareilly as RTO officials and traffic department restrict them from entering in the city and often seize their vehicles. The drivers submitted a memorandum on Thursday alleging that despite proper city permit and other necessary documents, officials ‘exploit’ them.    “Our vehicles are often stopped on the outskirts of the city despite proper documents of the taxi. The officials concerned do not even care to check the documents and straight away seize the vehicles and impose hefty fine on us. The traffic police often physically assault us,” said Munna Khan, a taxi driver. “I have been driving taxi for over 20 years now and this is my only source of income. Our livelihood has taken a hit but the officials concerned are least bothered about it,” he added.    According to taxi drivers, the regional transport office recently seized five taxis. Drivers alleged that one of the five taxis was released on Friday by paying a sum of Rs 10, 000 as fine, while remaining vehicles are still in RTO’s custody.    When contacted, regional transport officer (enforcement), M L Chaurasiya said, “We do not seize vehicles unnecessarily. The taxis are being seized due to violation of traffic rules and regulations. The taxi drivers have a contract carriage permit also known as region permit. According to this permit, taxis have a fixed area for ferrying passengers. However, these taxi drivers go against the rule and are often caught plying on the city roads, which is violation of contract carriage permit.”
