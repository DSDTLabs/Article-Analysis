Greater Noida: Three members of a vehicle-lifting gang operating in the NCR were arrested on Noida-  expressway on Sunday. The police also seized two stolen cars, a   Duster and a Swift Dzire, from them.

 The accused have been identified as Nisar (45), Yusuf (26) and Sohail (25), all from of Indore,  . Three other gang members — Amit and Naresh from Faridabad, and Asif, a resident of Rabupura — were arrested a few months ago for theft in Hapur, and are currently in judicial custody. The gang used to steal cars and sell them to unscrupulous buyers after manipulating the vehicles’ number plates. Two gang members are absconding.
 
 Acording to police, the recovered vehicles had been stolen from Greater Noida. While the Duster was stolen near   when its driver was waiting for his employer on April 12, the Dzire was stolen from the driver of a private company in Greater Noida in March.
 
 On Sunday night, cops received a tip-off that some vehicle thieves would be using the Noida-Greater Noida expressway. A police team deployed at the zero point of the expressway stopped a black Renault Duster for checking. “The three occupants of the SUV could not provide registration papers of the vehicle, upon which they were detained. They were taking the stolen vehicle to sell it,” a police officer told TOI.
 
 The car’s number plate was later found to be fake. During interrogation, the trio said they were part of a gang which stole cars and sold them after changing chassis and registration number plates. They used to consult scrap dealers to find old cars of the same model, and use the registration papers of the old cars to drive and sell the stolen cars for Rs 1-2 lakh.
 
 The police later recovered the Dzire from a hideout in Rabupura.
