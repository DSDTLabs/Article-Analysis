Margao: Despite constraints like lack of vehicles and shortage of manpower due to the upcoming assembly election, the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) is trying its best to keep the city clean, said   chairperson Dr Babita Angle Prabhudessai on Friday.

 As a pilot project, the civic body has tied up with 11 local schools, including Loyola High School, Fatima Convent High School, Presentation Convent High School, Mahila and Nutan English High School, Our Lady of Rosary High School (Fatorda) and Manovikas High School, where students have been asked to bring segregated waste from their homes to schools. “Incidentally, students of Manovikas English Medium School have handed over 941kg of waste to the civic body in a single day,” Prabhudessai said. 
 
 Stating that 1,500 students from classes V-X were participating in this exercise on a daily basis, Loyola High School principal Fr Peter Rodrigues praised the civic body for taking the initiative of educating students about the need to care for their environment and not litter their surroundings, besides segregating and recycling the waste.
 
 The MMC chairperson said about 76 MMC staff have been engaged by the Election Commission for poll-related work, leaving the civic body with very few drivers and labourers to collect the  . MMC sanitary inspector Viraj Arabekar said, “There will be more crisis during the three days of February 3, 4 and 5.”
