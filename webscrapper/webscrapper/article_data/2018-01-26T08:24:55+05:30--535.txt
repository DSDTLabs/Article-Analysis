A frequent TED and INK Talk speaker, he has popularized science among children by transforming common household items and garbage into learning toys and building blocks for scientific experiments.

Moreover, I am invited by several schools in Chennai, where I try to spread knowledge,” Gupta said. He has inspired generations of students to learn science from trash.
 
 Well-versed in Newtonian laws and the concepts of pressure, magnetism, force, vectors, angles, geometry, Gupta infuses life into newspapers, caps, matchsticks and many such common items.
