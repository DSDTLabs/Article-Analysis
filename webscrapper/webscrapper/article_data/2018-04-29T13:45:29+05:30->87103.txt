The solo guitar recital comprised of Spanish music from five centuries that will be played in chronological order starting from the 16th century going till the 20th century."

  Elaborating further, Santanu says, “I picked a few pieces from the old era of music too. For example, the piece composed for the Vihuela (a predecessor of the guitar) by Luys de Narváes in 1538 and another by Gaspar Sanz composed for the four-string Baroque guitar in the 1720s. I have also chose a set of variations based on an aria from Mozart’s opera, by Fernando Sor, who played a key role in the popularisation of the six-string guitar.”
 
  The audience enjoyed his performance thoroughly and requested for an encore, extending the event for longer than its designated time.
