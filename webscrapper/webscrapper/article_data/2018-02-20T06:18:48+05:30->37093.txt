KOLKATA: Mystery shrouds the death of three members of a family, including a couple and their two-year-old daughter, whose charred bodies were recovered from their Duttapukur residence in North 24 Parganas early on Monday morning.

 Cops are yet to ascertain whether it was an ‘accident’, ‘suicide pact’ or murder.
 
 The charred bodies of the husband   (36), wife   and their daughter   (2), were recovered from a room by the locals from Ghosh’s residence at Ichapur Nilganj’s Sadarpur. Ghosh’s brother Lob, who tried to rescue the couple, also received severe burn injuries and currently undergoing treatment in   district hospital.
 
 According to a locals, Ghosh, who was a private bus driver on route-81, returned home as usual on Sunday evening after his job. “He was also chatting with neighbours at a local tea-stall till 9.30pm,” said a neighbour.
 
 Around 2.30am, on hearing them screams, the locals rushed to their house to find thick smoke coming out from the room. Lob and his family —who live in another portion of the house — accompanied by the neighbours, broke open the door and found the trio lying burnt.
 
 The locals rushed them to Barasat hospital where Kajal was declared brought dead and Kush and his daughter were shifted to RG Kar hospital. But both father and daughter succumbed to burn injuries at the hospital.
 
 The locals, however, said they heard the couple quarrelling late on Sunday night before the duo went to sleep. “After they returned from the tea-stall, the couple fought over a family matter. Later they went to sleep together after having dinner,” a local said.
 
 Locals suspected Kajal woke up in the night and emptied a kerosene container on themselves and lit the fire.
 
 Police are, however, investigating all angles in the case. “Though preliminary we suspect that it might be a case of suicide, we are looking into the matter seriously. We are waiting for the autopsy report,” said Abhijit Banerjee, ASP, North 24 Parganas.
