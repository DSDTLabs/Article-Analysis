PANAJI: The state government is contemplating to get a stretch of national highway (NH 66) passing through   town denotified to provide relief to bar owners.

 Instead, the eastern bypass beginning from Nuvem junction and connecting to the present highway from the Arlem Circle via Raia is being proposed, minister for town and country planning ( )   said.
 
 “I have submitted a detailed proposal to the chief minister. He has agreed in principle. If the central government agrees to it then more than 1,000 bar owners will benefit from it,” Sardesai told TOI. The Fatorda MLA, who met the chief minister after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, said as per his proposal, the eastern bypass connecting Rawanfond linking the NH at   junction via Konkan railway road—a stretch of around 5-6 km—could be declared as national highway.
 
 Sources said that chief minister   has tentatively agreed to the proposal. A detailed report o this proposal has been sought from the PWD by Parrikar, sources said, adding that accordingly, an official letter will be dispatched to the Union ministry for road transport and highways. The eastern bypass is not part of the state highway. “It being a national highway, the central government has to agree to our proposal,” Sardesai said.
