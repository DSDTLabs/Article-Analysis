While   is in the midst of a retro revival, it’s not just going back in time but also the years – right down to your toddler days.

 Headbands, dungarees, pinafores, barettes, ruffles, rompers...If you think this is a shopping list for your kid, think again. Because in 2018, mothers can borrow cuts and accessories from their kids, as the ‘oldies but goodies’ revival continues to be fashion forward. Fashion stylist and wardrobe consultant Jaanvi Chowhan says, “Fashion trends come back in different ways. For now, ruffles, tulle skirts, and sheer fabrics are seen in more adult outfits.” 
 
 
 
 Ahmedabad-based designer and entrepreneur Priyanshi Jariwala has seen a surge in demand for mom-kid coordinated clothes – for occasion and casual wear. “Borrow from your baby” is a thing now. What also works in its favour is the element of summer fun. As designer Babita Malkani says, “Innocent, vibrant and carefree vibes always work best for summer fashion. Cutesy prints, delicate details, kids wear inspired silhouettes make one celebrate their own memories.” Designer Amy Billimoria suggests fun fusions with elements from kids’ couture. “Pick funky character graphics, polka dots or accessories like bandanas and headbands. My hot favourite would be a dungaree — full length or capris — worn with a white tee or coloured shirt,” she says.
 
 Chowhan says, “Team ruffles with a heavily-embroidered blouse or a crop top for an adult upgrade,” she adds. For Malkani, the trends that work are: the pinafore gingham dress, washed out denim or rainbow stripes in bold candy colours or pretty pastels.
  
 
 
 In 2017, Delpozo, Chanel, Ellie Saab and Alexander Wang heralded the return of the quintessential school girl accessory – the hairband. Social influencers and style stars like Bella Hadid, sister Gigi, Selena Gomez gave a nod to the classic clips – barettes. Designer Jyoti Sharma Bajaj says that we find comfort in this trend and adds, “Memories play a vital role in how we dress. Our favourite styles are deeply rooted in our childhood.” Her picks: frills, soft pastels, Peter Pan collars. Matchy-matchy accessories is a great way to get an in into this trend.
  Following kiddie fashion doesn’t mean infantilising. Adult it up. Like adult headbands for 2018 might have bows or bling, but they are more edgy. Go for black or leather. Bottom line: have fun with fashion.
 
 
 
 Trying ruffles or lace? Remember to have fun. Adulting is okay for the week .
 
 
 
 Rompers for adults get a bad rap as it’s considered infantile. Pick playsuits in neutral colours.
 
 
 
 - Bows are big this season, use well to add a cute vibe

 Match much or twinning is the new baby-mommy trend. Here are some tips to keep in mind: 
 - Pick funky prints, keeping the kid in mind
 - It should be ‘same, same but different’ – basically not the same style but a nod to it
 - Wear grown-up hair 
 - Add elements like brooches, pins or hairbands
 
 - One kiddie style to define this season? Anti-fit smock dress in gingham
 
 - To avoid kiddie fashion from looking costumey, stick to one element
