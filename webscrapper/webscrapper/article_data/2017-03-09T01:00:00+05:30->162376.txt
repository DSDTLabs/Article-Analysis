Actually,  , was bang on. Sorry, if bang is not quite the sanskari phrase to use here. He was right about Lipstick Under My Burkha being a ‘lady oriented’ film. Because, guess what, CBFC chief,   do fantasise. Fantasising is ‘lady oriented’. And if that’s what you meant by that peculiar phrase, you have hit the spot, and how. Oh! there we go again.

 But thanks to  , most folks will now know what’s on our minds! Trust us, we women are not always planning the next meal, or worrying about junior’s social science class, or drying up clothes on the washing line, or dressing up for our husbands. Those are the sanskari stuff.

Here’s what he had to say
