THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   has decided to invoke penalty provisions against candidates appointed to the post of assistant engineers, if they quit before completing three years of service. The board decided to insist on a minimum compulsory service period for newly-recruited sub-engineers who undergo extensive induction-cum-training programme, which KSEB introduced recently. 

 If candidates - who undergo this statutory training - wish to resign, they will have to pay a compensation ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakh. The amount would vary depending on the training they received and the experience they acquired from KSEB.
 
 An order issued by KSEB on July 4 reads: The board was forced to introduce stringent provisions as some sub-engineers submitted their resignation in the middle of the training programme the board provided at a considerably-high cost.
 
 Earlier, the induction training period was less than two weeks for new recruits. This is the first time KSEB is imparting integrated induction-cum -statutory training programme for newly-recruited assistant engineers to abide with the stipulations of the central electricity authority.
 
 Employees who had finished statutory training were told to execute an indemnity bond specifying that they would serve in specified areas of training for two years immediately after the training period, failing which they would have to pay a compensation to the board. But, only some employees undergo the mandatory training, which is offered to them at different intervals during their career.
 
 The newly-introduced provisions will not be applicable to candidates who had submitted their resignation before the issuance of the order. 
 
 But the same would be binding to others who are currently undergoing training. Over 150 newly-recruited assistant engineers are undergoing training from May 18, 2017 onwards.
