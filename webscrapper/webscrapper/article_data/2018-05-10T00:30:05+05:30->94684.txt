Thiruvananthapuram: Come May 12, and the city will get its first  .

 ‘Olam’, as its organizers—a group of city-based youths working in different sectors—call it, will be held for two days between 4pm and 11pm at Golf Club.
 
 Tony Cyriac first thought of introducing the flea market, and the idea clicked with others. In two months, the members—aged 18-24—of the collective swelled.
 
 Cyriac said around 63 people, home chefs, jewellers and artists, registered to participate in the event. Some eateries, too, joined in.
 
 “Our team came together with the aim to celebrate Trivandrum. The concept of flea market is trending across the country except here. Olam is providing a space to small vendors, who are mostly into online business. Our aim was to find maximum 50 vendors,” he said.
 
 The two-day event has been planned as a summer edition, and more would follow. 
 
 Anina Elizabeth Jacob, a coordinator of the event, said Olam would be curated by architects of the Indian Institute of Architects.
 
 “Fun activities such as games and music performances by various bands have been planned. There will be a pet adoption drive arranged by Hands for Pows,” she said.
 
 Olam will feature various stalls such as food stall by Afiya Thaha, popular in the city as ‘Khunafa girl’ through her Arabic dessert Khunafa, doodle art by artist Arosh Thevadathilknown (Doodle Muni), handcrafted anklets by Trinkel and Kerala-inspired decor from Quirkyi.
 
 As a promotion, an online video production firm Travancore Tales released a ‘Trivandrum song’ 'Olam angalu polam' which became an instant hit. The team Olam has also arranged installations and live music events at major locations for the promotion of the event.
