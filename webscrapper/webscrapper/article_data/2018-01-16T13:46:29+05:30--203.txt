VARANASI:Worried over the slow progress of four-lane conversion of  , Varanasi-Ghazipur and   highways, the   (NHAI) is looking at the land aquisition process. The officials are of the view that even if the process of land acquisition is expedited the completion of all these projects will be possible after March 2019. 

 The   highway is part of Varanasi-Lucknow highway, which was initially approved by the Congress-led UPA government in 2013. Despite beginning the basic work on Varanasi-Sultanpur patch, the NHAI could not proceed further. With the change in guard at the Centre in 2014, the projects for four-lane conversion of these three highways were started by the NHAI but due to delay in completing the land acquisition process, the agency could not make much progress. Not much has changed still. 
 
 The agency's chairman   would be holding meetings for the same on Tuesday.
