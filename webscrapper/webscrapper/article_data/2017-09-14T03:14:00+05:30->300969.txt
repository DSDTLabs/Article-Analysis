Panaji: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Wednesday urged all beneficiaries of the Deen Dayal Swasthya Seva Yojna, the state government’s medical insurance scheme, to come forward for the scheme’s ongoing renewal process. He said that only 1.46 lakh persons had got their mediclaim cards renewed so far. Parrikar said that the new enrolment for the scheme is set to begin in December.

 He said that the scheme will be opened for enrolment with better facilities and wider coverage of hospitals.
 
 “Of the Rs 60-odd crore, claims for Rs 48-odd crore have been received. The rest of the unclaimed amount gets refunded to the state government. Of these claims, those of around Rs 12 crore were in government hospitals. Nowhere, you will get a cover of Rs 4 lakh for your family at such a nominal installment. The scheme has been extended by another three months. All should come and get their cards renewed,” Parrikar said.
 
 He said that the rejection rate of claims under the scheme is very less at less than one percent of all claims. DDSSY covers entire resident population, residing in Goa for five years and more.Benefits under this scheme are provided on a cashless basis to the beneficiaries.
