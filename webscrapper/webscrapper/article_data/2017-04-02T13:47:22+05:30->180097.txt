NEW DELHI: Sunday will add yet another chapter in what is becoming a storied rivalry between ace shuttlers   and  . In their respective semi-final clashes on Saturday, the duo recorded contrasting victories to set up a mouth-watering summit clash in the women's singles event of the 2017 India Open Super Series.

 While Carolina breezed past fourth seed Akane Yamaguchi 21-16, 21-4 in straight games, PV Sindhu won a hotly contested semi-final against Sung Ji Yun to win 21-18, 18-21, 21-14 at the Siri Fort Sports Complex in New Delhi. It will be the 10th time that the two will square-off at an international event. So far, the Spaniard leads in head to head battles against the Indian, winning five of the nine encounters including the final of the Rio Olympics in August last year. 
  
 
  takes a brief look at how their rivalry has shaped over the years that had its beginning in the junior circuit.
 
 
 It was their first meeting at the international level. At the 2010 BWF World Junior Championships, held in Mexico, Sindhu defeated Marin 21-17, 21-19 in a women's singles match. 
 
 
 In their first meeting at the senior level, Sindhu again prevailed over Carolina, beating her 21-7, 15-21, 21-13 in the third round. Sindhu went on to win the tournament after getting a walkover against compatriot PC Thulasi in the final.
 
 
 There years later, they met again and this time at the Australian Open 2014. For this first time in their meetings, Carolina tasted victory at international level, halting the Indian's march in the quarterfinals with a straight game 21-17, 21-17 victory. The Spanish Queen however, clashed with   in the title clash and lost 18-21, 11-21.
 
 
 Two months later in the same year, they faced each other in the semi-finals of the 2014 World Championships in Copenhagen and for the second successive time, Carolina walked away with a 21-17, 21-15 victory. In fact, Carolina went on to win the crown for the second consecutive time, beating China's Li Xuerui (21-8, 21-14) in the final. Sindhu, though won a historic second successive bronze. 
 
 
 They were to again clash in a semi-final of an event and this time on Sindhu's home turf. But Carolina went on to complete a hat-trick of wins against the Indian. She registered a rather easy 21-13, 21-13 win. Eerily, in a repeat of the 2014 Australian Open where Carolina had also eliminated Sindhu in the knockouts but lost to Saina in the final, the former world no 1 lost the title match 21-19, 23-25, 16-21 against, well, Saina. 
 
 
 By 2015, Carolina had established herself as one of the premier shuttlers. She went on to face Sindhu in the semi-finals of the Denmark Open Superseries 2015. She was favourite for the clash considering her past record against the Indian but Sindhu stunned her in three games to win 21-15, 18-21, 21-17 but lost in the final against Li Xuerui (19-21, 12-21). 
 
 
 In the following month, they met in the opening round of the Hong Kong Superseries. Carolina went on to improve her overall record to 4-3 after emerging victorious 21-17, 21-9. She went all the way to the final and clinched the title beating   of   21-17, 18-21, 22-20.
 
 
 The biggest prize. Billion-plus eyes glued to their TV screens. Sindhu v Carolina in Olympic final. The match lived up to its billing. There was heartbreak for Sindhu who gave a close competition in a match that lasted three games before losing 21-19, 12-21, 15-21 to return home with a historic silver. She also became the first female from India to win an Olympian silver. 
 
 
 It wasn't long before Sindhu would get a chance to exact revenge. At the year-ending Dubai World Superseries Finals, she downed Carolina 21-17, 21-13. Sindhu went on to reach the semi-finals where she lost to Sung Ji Hyun and Carolina had to return winless, losing all three of her group matches.
