BADAL: For the first time in two decades, the family of Punjab’s former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal will no longer be in the corridors of power in the state, and the fact has already made the villagers just a tad unhappy. They are now looking towards the former CM’s estranged nephew   to fill the void. 

 Manpreet has been made the finance minister in the new Congress government in Punjab.
 
 Residents of Badal, situated on   road, feel that with SAD losing power, the village has lost its sheen. They feel that Manpreet being made the cabinet minister was a saving grace for them.
 
 In the last 20 years, the Akali patriarch remained chief minister for three terms. From 2002 to 2007 despite losing power, he was the leader of the opposition. His son Sukhbir Badal became the deputy CM in 2008 and daughter-in-law got inducted into the Union cabinet in 2014 in the NDA government.
 
 “We used to feel at the top of the world with Badals at the helm of affairs. Right from 1997 till February 2017, we got a lot not only for Badal but for surrounding villages as well. Now, as SAD has got its worst drubbing, we are fearing the village may lose the extra leverage it got in the past. We are hopeful that   will do justice with his surname and will not let the villagers down,” Badal resident Mohinder Singh said.
 
 Another villager Kewal Ram said, “We see a Badal in Manpreet. He too has a lot of interest in the village development. Times may change with Badals losing power, but in Manpreet we see another star on the horizon.”
 
 “A multipurpose stadium, national-level shooting range, de-addiction centre and a lot more had come to our village under the Parkash Singh Badal regime. We hope these institutions will continue to get grants even if no other facility is added,” said Badal resident Shamsher Singh.
