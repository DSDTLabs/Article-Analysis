VADODARA: Art collectors, who want to add an original work of just letters and numbers to their collection, need look no further now. A city-based artist is using the art of hand-lettering or ‘drawing’ to visualize quotes and sayings into pieces of art.

 Twenty-six-year-old Pragya   in   from  . Recently, she left her job at a local firm to practice typography as an art full-time. “It’s called hand-lettering, since it is done by hand and not a machine. It mainly involves ‘drawing’ the letters on the basis of a concept which I either develop myself or is suggested to me. I use a variety of pens to do my work,”   said.
 
 The execution takes almost four hours from beginning to completion. “Simply visualizing the concept itself takes a much longer time, since I need to understand where everything goes and what the message is supposed to be,” Tripathi added.
 
 It was her initial love for letters that led her to experiment with doodling and different fonts. But in the last year, the experimenting grew into a passion for her art. Tripathi also believes that her passion for music helped her to develop her hand-lettering.
 
 “As a musician, I focused on lyrics, and was attached to the words. I have always admired thoughtful and introspective writing. I first started hand-lettering because I wanted to capture the essence of the lyrics in my art,” she added.
 
 Asked about her future plans, Tripathi said she was undecided. She said, “I have been receiving   to put my work on sale. I have also received many proposals for client commissions but right now, I am attached to my work. I am still practising, but who knows, maybe I will sell them one day.”
