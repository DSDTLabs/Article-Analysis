RANCHI: Lack of e-waste management facilities is a major concern for the city. At present, the state does not have any recycling or e-waste management plant, compelling most of the shops producing e-waste to sell it to the scrap dealers. 

 It has been found that Daily Market, which is the biggest e-waste producer in the city, has no proper disposal facility. Mohammad Azhar, who owns a shop in the market, said, "We collect all our electronic waste in the warehouse and sell it to scrap dealers every month. However, I do not know what happens to them after that."
 
 However, some educated dealers do understand the harmful effects of e-waste and try to recycle as much as possible. Sharad Banerjee, who owns a computer shop in  , said, "We have a tie-up with a Delhi-based company which purchases the e-waste produced in our shop and take them to Delhi for recycling."
 
 Pro vice-chancellor of   (Hazaribag) and secretary of   (NEA), M P Sinha, said the amount of e-waste generated is proportional to the number of gadgets each person uses.
 
 "Just because it does not leave a foul smell or is a nuisance in appearance, it is not grabbing attention," he said.
 
 Member secretary of  , Sanjay Kumar Suman said that while the state does not have any authentic figures on the amount of e-waste produced, the work of data collection is still on.
 
 "The latest E-Waste management Rules, 2016 has been notified only a few months ago and we are in the preliminary process of implementation." Suman added that steps to dispose e-waste can be taken only after getting the exact idea about the waste being produced in the state.
 
 "IT professionals have been allotted the work to figure out the current situation and they are working in 10 cities, including Ranchi, to know the amount of waste being produced everyday," he said. Many private organisations have been roped in to spread awareness about precautions to be taken while disposing e-waste.
