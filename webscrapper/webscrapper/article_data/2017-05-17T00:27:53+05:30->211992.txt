New Delhi: In a bid to decongest the area around Pragati Maidan, PWD is likely to start work on a 1.1km-long   from  . It will pass through the fairground connecting Purna Quila Road with Ring Road, .

 Part of a Rs 800-crore project to redevelop road infrastructure and connectivity around Pragati Maidan, the tunnel seeks to decongest Mathura Road, Bhairon Marg and the neighbouring areas. “We hope to complete the work in a year,” said Sarvagya Srivastava, engineer-in-chief, PWD.
 
 PWD officials said they would coordinate with National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) while constructing the tunnel as the proposed exhibition halls at Pragati Maidan would be constructed above it. The tunnel will also be linked with the basement parking lot with a capacity to accommodate 4,800 vehicles at Pragati Maidan so that people can directly access the fairground from Ring Road, Punara Quila and Bhairon Marg. 
 
 PWD officials said the tunnel would have state-of-the-art features like ventilator with sensors, appropriate lighting and fire-fighting equipment. “In case of a traffic jam in this long tunnel, the emission will increase inside. Hence, the ventilation system will have sensors to adjust itself accordingly,” said Srivastava. The tunnel will have two carriageways with three lanes each. There will also be a 1.2-metre-wide pavement on both sides for pedestrians.
 
 PWD officials said the work on making Mathura Road signal-free will also start soon.
 
 While the overall project has been approved by the Union urban development ministry, the Delhi government is yet to finalise the funding process. PWD officials said 80% of the Rs 800 crore project will be funded by the Centre, but there is no decision on the rest. “Whether ITPO will pay the balance amount or Delhi government, it is yet to be decided,” said an official.
