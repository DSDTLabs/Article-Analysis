CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday refused to initiate a suo motu plea against striking workers of   state transport corporations.

 Pointing out that the strike by transport workers' unions had left scores of commuters stranded at bus stops in various parts of the state since Thursday evening, advocate Vijayendran made an urgent mention on behalf of petitioner Varaaki before the first bench headed by Chief Justice Indira Banerjee. 
 
 He wanted the court to direct the state government to convene a meeting to negotiate with the striking workers and find a solution to the issue within 24 hours. 
 
 However, refusing to entertain the plea, the bench asked the advocate to file a proper petition, which would be taken up for hearing in the normal course. 
 
 Drivers and conductors of various state transport corporations -  ,   and   â€“ went on a flash strike on Thursday evening as talks with transport minister MR Vijayabaskar on wage revision remained inconclusive. After the talks failed in the night, the unions announced an indefinite strike.
