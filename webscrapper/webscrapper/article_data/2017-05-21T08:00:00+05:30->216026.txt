SHIMLA: Four earthquakes of low intensity rocked Chamba region of   since Friday morning. Although no loss of life and property has been reported, the mild tremors left people worried as the district falls under seismic zone IV and V, which makes it vulnerable to seismic activities of severe intensity.

 The first earthquake of 2.8 magnitude was reported at around 3.23am on Friday and the second earthquake of 4.5 magnitude was reported at around 5.32am, with a depth of 5km. On Saturday, the first earthquake of 3.6 magnitude was reported at around 9.11am with a depth of 10km while the second earthquake of 4.1 magnitude was reported at around 11.18am with a depth of 5km.
 
 A report prepared by the District Disaster Management Authority, Chamba says the district, which is located in the heart of the  , is likely to be affected by earthquakes. It said the area has been affected by numerous shallow to high intensity earthquakes over the past few decades.
 
 The report said the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) fault passes below the district and is the continuation of the same fault which caused the 1905 Kangra earthquake. The presence of several smaller faults can also generate earthquakes of high intensity in Chamba. On March 24, 1995 an earthquake of 4.9 magnitude caused a fierce earthquake in which over 70% houses developed cracks, the report said.
