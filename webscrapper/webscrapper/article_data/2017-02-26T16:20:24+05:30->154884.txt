The   singer   says he is not attending the 89th   despite actress   tagged the rocker in a post which read "Oscars here we come." 

 On Saturday, Priyanka confirmed that she will be a part of this year's Oscars ceremony by posting a selfie of herself along with Jagger. 
 
 "Change of plans! Oscars here we come. Mick Jagger LA LA Land," she captioned the   picture of them taking inside the airport terminal. 
 
  
  
 Post the 34-year-old actress' update on the photo-video sharing app, many believed that Jagger, 74, will attend the ceremony with her. 
 
 
  
 However, the English singer rubbished the reports by tweeting, "How odd, I read that I'm going to the Oscars with Priyanka Chopra. I shall not be going to the Oscars at all." 
 
 Priyanka made her debut at the Oscars in 2016, where she presented an award for best film editing with actor Liev Schriber.
