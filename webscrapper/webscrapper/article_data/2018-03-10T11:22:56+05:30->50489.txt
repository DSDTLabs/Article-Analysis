 One of the reporter asks Parth if he has married twice, and lives with both the wives. Much to everyone's dismay, he replies to them and Teni and Shorvari join him.
 
 Priya comes to speak to Dada ji that she can go to any extent for her right. She throws black colour on Parth, Shorvari and Teni. Mohini rejoices.
 
 Next morning, Teni complains about a headache. Indu tells her that they had advertised their relation in front of media. She says that it was planned by Priya.
 
 Mohini explains to Dada ji that she only served the bhang, she didn't prepare it. Parth, Teni and Shorvari come downstairs and Indu questions how someone else can mix the Bhang when Mohini had held the thandai in her hands all the time. Mohini says it was Pyaray Lal and his Kaka who prepared the thandai.
 
 Mohini calls Pyaray Nath and asks him if he prepared the Bhang and Thandai. He agrees. Teni aks that why is it that only the three of them ended up with the Bhang mixed thandai. Mohini, in order to stress the point of her innosence, breaks down into tears and swears on her dead husband that she had nothing to do with the subject in question. Baa sends her to her room.
 
 Parth says they never wanted to put the family in any trouble. He apologizes to Dada ji and the latter says that it's time for them to face the society and show them that they are right.
