AMRITSAR: Two days after constituting a sub-committee to review the controversial movie ‘Nanak Shah Fakir’ , the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Saturday approached Prime Minister   seeking his intervention to stop its release.   president   told TOI on Saturday that following objections from Sikh sangat (community) on the content of movie, they had constituted an eight-member panel on April 5 to re-examine it.

 “We had invited producer of the movie   to attend the meeting of newly-constituted committee on Saturday but he didn’t come,” said Longowal, adding that Sikka was adamant on releasing the movie on April 13.
 
 On April 5, SGPC had directed Sikka to not release the movie unless the the sub-committee gave its report and had also objected to using SGPC’s name especially after withdrawal of the no objection certificate ( ) given to Sikka in the past.
 
 Longowal informed that SGPC had written letters to PM, home minister Rajnath Singh, information and broadcast minister Smriti Irani and chief minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh urging them to impose a ban on release of ‘Nanak Shah Fakir.’ “We have asked them to intervene and stop the release of movie in the wake of Sikh sentiments. If the movie is allowed to be released, it can cause resentment among Sikhs,” he said
 
 Man Sikh bodies, including SGPC and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), had been objecting to the movie for allegedly portraying the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev in human form and had also appealed to Jathedar of   to issue directions to impost a ban on its screening. SGPC had earlier issued NOC to Sikka but later withdrew it despite the launch of music of the film.
