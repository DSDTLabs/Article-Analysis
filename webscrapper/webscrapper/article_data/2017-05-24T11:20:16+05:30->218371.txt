MYSURU: Railway minister   flagged off the inaugural run of the daily express from   to Hubballi (via Bengaluru) through a video link from New Delhi on Tuesday. 

 The live streaming of the event was organized at   station on Platform No. 6. The   weekly express train was also launched. 
 
 Commuters between Bengaluru and Mysuru have been demanding one more train which leaves before   as this train tends to be overcrowded. This train departs from Bengaluru at 5.45pm and reaches Mysuru at 8.40pm. Every day, it leaves Mysuru at 6.15am and reaches Bengaluru at 9.10am, well before the scheduled timings of Chamundi Express. This train will reduce the number of passengers on Chamundi Express and help passengers reach their workplace on time. 
 
 Currently, the connectivity between Hubballi and Varanasi and Hubballi and Jabalpur is limited and through two changeover points.
