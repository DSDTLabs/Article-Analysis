NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday decided to rope in the Comptroller and Auditor General ( ) to   city’s forest department and other civic agencies to find out how much money was generated by them from the permission granted to cut trees.

 A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar asked the national auditor to examine the accounts as it wants to know how the timber from felled trees and the money charged for permission to cut them, were being utilised. The court’s direction came as it expressed concern over rising air pollution due to less green cover.
 
 “When trees are felled in large numbers by the agencies for developmental and commercial projects, timber is available to them in large quantities. The question that arises is what happens to the timber,” the bench said and added, “We have to check the trail of timber and the trail of money.”
 
 The Delhi government and the corporations had told the court that some timber is auctioned off and some provided free of cost to crematoriums.
 
 The court said, “In that case it is necessary to know what happens to the funds received from auction of timber and to what extent the free timber is given to crematoriums, by whom and what happens to that” as bereaved families have to pay for the wood at crematoriums.
 
 “We feel that an exercise needs to be done with regard to felling of trees, green cover and compensatory afforestation which also includes utilisation of timber and money accruing from felling of trees,” the court said.
 
 It requested the CAG to carry out an audit on these aspects of the forest department of the Delhi government and other agencies, including the three municipal corporations, the New Delhi Municipal Council, the Cantonment Board, Delhi Metro, Northern Railway and the Public Works Department.
