BENGALURU: Journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh and scholar MM   were killed with the same 7.65 mm country-made pistol, preliminary findings of the   have indicated.

 "Given our wherewithal, we could establish an 80% likelihood that the same weapon was used in the two cri mes after analyzing cartridges," a source with access to the report said. Kalburgi was shot dead in August 2015 in his   home. Forensic reports had established the pistol used to kill Kalburgi was used to gun down Communist leader Go vind Pansare in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, a few months earlier. A preliminary ballistics report is likely to be submitted to the SIT probing the case on Wednesday.
