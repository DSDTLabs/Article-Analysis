Vadodara: The M S University (MSU) teachers and deans were in for a surprise when they got a missive from the university accounts office stating that their salaries will be withheld as they had not provided their declaration forms for income tax. The university eventually said that the salaries will only be delayed and no drastic action will be taken.

 The chief accounts officer of the university had written the letter after the teachers had failed to submit their declarations despite repeated reminders. But it was the deans who were in for a surprise and said that they had little to do with the entire issue.
 
 The incident was being touted as one of collective punishment hinting at the fact that the deans would suffer for no fault of theirs. The fact that no notice of them facing such an action was circulated was also widely discussed.
 
 The deans also wondered if they had the authority to take action if their colleagues did not comply and submit the declaration. A hunt was made for any provision that could have authorised the university to take such an action. Some even found the letter insulting.
 
 MSU vice chancellor Professor Parimal Vyas said that the communication was misunderstood. “But 500 persons have not submitted the declaration so far. The salaries will not be stopped or held, but they will be delayed,” he said.
