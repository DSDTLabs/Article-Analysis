CHANDIGARH: An 11-year-old dalit girl was gang raped by two neighbours in a village under Matloda police station of Haryana’s   district on Saturday night. After the gang rape, the girl was murdered and then her assailants allegedly committed necrophilia for over four hours.

 The two accused, identified as   (27) and   (22), have been arrested and booked for the murder and gang rape under various sections of POCSO Act.
 
 The police is trying to verify confessions of both the accused that they committed necrophilia after murdering the girl. “The accused have confessed to their crime.

 The 11-year-old was living with her grandfather as her mother had remarried after divorcing her father. She had gone missing on Saturday evening after she left home to throw garbage outside.
 
 Her neighbour   Kumar, who is married, spotted the girl when she was outside her house and called her to his house. He was drinking alcohol with his friend Sagar at his residence as his family was away.
 
 In his confession, Pardeep said that initially both he and Sagar had verbally and sexually harassed the girl. The two accused then raped her and when she tried to resist they strangled her to death. The two men confessed they kept her body with them till 11 pm and committed necrophilia before abandoning it near the village pond. According to the police, the two accused confessed to committing necrophilia under the influence of alcohol.
 
 The girl’s body was found near some bushes close to Pardeep’s house by a few local women. They informed the village sarpanch who, in turn, informed the girl’s grandfather as well as the police. After getting the information, the Panipat SP too visited the spot.
