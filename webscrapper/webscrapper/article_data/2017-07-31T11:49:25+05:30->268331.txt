 So what's she reading at the moment? "My entire historical romance collection. And I'm loving it," she beams.
 
 As a producer, has she read a book and wanted to turn it into a film? "I think all good books should be made into films," she quips but then admits that there are very few books that you can actually visualise on screen, especially   films.
