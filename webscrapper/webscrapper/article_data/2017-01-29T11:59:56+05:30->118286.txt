Good girl gone bad   is all set to take over international cinema with her debut Hollywood film ' '. Ahead of the film's release on January 13, the makers have released a behind the scenes clip of the actress giving us a brief sketch of her character ' the huntress Serena Under. 

 As if the action-packed trailer of Deepika kicking some bad-boy butt wasn't enough, the star reveals that her character is a lot like that of leading man   a.k.a Xander Cage. Talking about her character, Deepika says, 'When you first meet Serena, you don't know whose side she is on. She is a representation of women in today's world. She is independent, intelligent and can stand up for herself. She is always observing, learning. I think what draws Xander to Serena is the fact that he sees a lot of him in her. You realise how similar they are to each other and then you see how they work together as a team. Slowly you discover that she is there for a much larger mission.'
 
 Directed by DJ Caruso, 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' will premiere in India a week prior to its global release. Fans of the series will have even more reason to look forward to the release as leading man Vin Diesel will be flying down to Mumbai to attend the grand launch with Deepika.
  
 Here's the video below, to help you get through the long wait.
