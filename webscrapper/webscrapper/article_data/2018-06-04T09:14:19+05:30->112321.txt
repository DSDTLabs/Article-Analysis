NAGPUR: Standing committee chairman Virendra Kukreja will present the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s ( ) budget for the 2018-19 fiscal on June 11. Though it got delayed, the budget will be crucial with the Lok Sabha elections slated in the current fiscal.

 
 
 NMC sources told TOI that a discussion will be organized on June 13 in which corporators from all political parties will express their views on the budget followed by its approval.
 
 Kukreja, who assumed charge on March 5, was supposed to present the budget before April 1 as the civic body functions as per provisions in the budget from commencement of the new fiscal. However, as it got delayed, the NMC, from April 1, has been following the budget presented by the municipal commissioner.
 
 For the last 12 years, the standing committee chairpersons have been delaying the budget. Sudhir ‘Bandu’ Raut had presented the budget on March 27 in 2016. Sandip Jadhav, too, had delayed it and presented it on June 17 last year.
 
 It is likely that Kukreja will propose some new developmental projects and increase ward and zone funds for corporators.
 
 Ashwin Mudgal had presented a budget of Rs2,048.53 crore. The NMC’s last fiscal’s revenue was around Rs1,700 crore and hence Mudgal’s budget seemed realistic.
 
 Haling from north Nagpur, Kukreja is likely to propose some projects in this backward class dominated assembly constituency in the wake of Lok Sabha elections.   had always lagged behind Congress, BSP and RPI factions in this constituency.
 
 Kukreja’s budget will also be very important as far as the NMC’s revenue is concerned. The NMC’s dependency on the central and the state government is swelling with every passing year. Despite a local self governing body, around 55-60% of its revenue comes from the government. The NMC’s financial crisis is also on rise every fiscal.
 
 Kukreja is likely to avoid any hike in property tax, water tariff, building plan sanction etc.
