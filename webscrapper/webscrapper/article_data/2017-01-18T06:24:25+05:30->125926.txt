AHMEDABAD: The ambitious   (CBD), spread over 122 hectares, planned on Ashram road was projected as a game-changer in urban planning when Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) first declared the development plan in 2013. But not much has moved on that front after that.

 The reason for this is that the local area plan (LAP) for west and east sides of the CBD on Ashram road—consisting of special rules for parking, ground use, road connectivity and public transport facility — is not yet ready. As a result, the three realty projects that were allowed to build 22-floor buildings have been stalled.
 
 The LAP for Ashram road should have been ready by August last year. But sources in AUDA and   (AMC) said that the general development control regulations (GDCR) for LAP for the west side of the CBD will be not ready until March-end. 
 
 This launch is most likely to coincide with the auction of volumetric development rights over two plots on the adjoining Sabarmati riverfront. Sources in the AMC said that the three developers had been assigned an FSI of 2.9 in the first phase. Once the LAP for the CBD is approved by the state government in the coming three months, the construction can be scaled up to an FSI of 5.4.
 
 Sources in the estate department said that, till date, three buildings have been given permissions under CBD which include one Takshashila — a residential-cum-commercial complex — that would come up behind Town Hall in Ellisbridge. 
 
 Another business complex is strangely called the ‘Third World Center’. It would come up within the Dinesh Hall compound while the third, LA  , is being built by   just beside the RBI building.
