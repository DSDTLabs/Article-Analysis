PANAJI: Over 17,000 postal ballots have been issued to government employees and police personnel across the state who were engaged in election duty on February 4.

 These   could play a crucial role in deciding the fate of the contestants in many constituencies as the number is large and the margins could be narrow.
 
 All government employees posted at the 1,642 polling stations in the state, including the local police force and support staff, like drivers, who worked to ensure that the   were carried out smoothly, have until early morning on March 11, to send in their postal ballots.
 
 The voter then has to sign a declaration Form 13A in the presence of a stipendiary magistrate and get it attested by the magistrate. 
 
 Those on election duty can get their forms attested by any gazette officer or by the presiding officer of the polling station where they were on election duty.
 
 This declaration then has to be taken to an authorized officer and signed in his/her presence after he/she is satisfied about the identity of the voter. The officer will attest the voter’s signature and return the declaration. Voters mustn’t reveal their choice of candidate to the attesting officer.
 
 The authorized officer can intervene in case a voter is illiterate, blind and is inflicted with some other infirmity. The authorized officer can mark and sign on the declaration on the voter’s behalf in his/her presence and in accordance with the voter’s wishes. Once the formalities are complete, the voter then has to place the declaration in Form 13A and the smaller envelope marked A containing the ballot paper in the larger envelope marked B and send it to the returning officer by post or by messenger. The voter has to sign on the space provided on the cover marked ‘Voters need not affix a postage stamp’.
 
 Postal ballot voters must ensure that their envelopes reach the returning officer before 8 am on March 11.
