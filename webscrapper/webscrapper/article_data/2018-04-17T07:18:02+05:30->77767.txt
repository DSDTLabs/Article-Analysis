CHENNAI: When Tamilazhagi’s younger brother passed away, his children had no one to care for them. Despite all the challenges she faced, Tamilazhagi took them under her wing and brought them up as her own. On April 17, she will be honoured with the Born2WinTrans Mother Of The Year 2018 award.

 The Sixth Annual Trans Achiever   will be held at Rani Seethai Hall to mark the National   Day, observed every year on April 15. Achievers from the transgender community will be felicitated for thinking beyond the norm and making a difference to their community. Awardees include medical students, entrepreneurs, a physiotherapist, a model and social activists, among others.
 
 “We want to felicitate people who have emerged as a role model to the community,” says Swetha Sudhakar C, director, Born2Win Social Welfare Trust. “We want to bring the transgender community into the mainstream by providing education, employment and a conducive environment,” she adds. In addition to rehabilitation, the organisation also provides support to women in need, children of single mothers, HIV+ children, and children with cancer to show that trans people are socially conscious.
 
 The annual awards are held to identify and create new   within the community, and also to send out the message that transgender people can live a full life without resorting to commercial sex work or begging.
 
 Other awardees include Arun Prabhu, director of the Tamil film ‘Aruvi’, lauded for the sensitive portrayal of a trans character; autodriver N Ragini who now runs and operates two autos of her own; social worker  , the first trans person to stand for elections on the ticket of a political party; Kerala-based trans model   and Tiruchi Siva, Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha, who was responsible for the introduction of the Transgender Bill.
