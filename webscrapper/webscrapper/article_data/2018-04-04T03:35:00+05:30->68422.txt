Panaji: At a time when I&B ministry’s controversial plan to punish journalists for peddling alleged “fake news” was scrapped by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Goa legislative assembly’s guidelines have put selective restrictions on coverage of the House proceedings. The five-page guidelines have put restrictions on accreditation of journalists from weeklies, fortnightlies and monthlies, while journalists from newspapers with a minimum daily circulation of 15,000 copies will only be permitted entry to the press gallery. “All newspapers of a group/holding company would be considered as a single entity for issuance of passes, irrespective of region and language,” the guidelines said. After the Goa union of journalists demanded its scrapping, speaker Pramod Sawant told TOI that the issues could be resolved at the press advisory committee meeting. “We tightened security in the assembly complex and don’t allow public without valid identity card,” he said. The guidelines clarified that the accreditation card of directorate of information & publicity was for speedier security clearance of mediapersons, and it did not entitle an applicant to claim accreditation to the press gallery in the assembly.
