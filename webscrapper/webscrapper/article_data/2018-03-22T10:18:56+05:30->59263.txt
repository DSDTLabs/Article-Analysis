PUNE: The state government on Wednesday declared Junnar taluka in Pune district as a ‘special tourism zone’ as it is the only place that houses not only Chhatrapati Shivaji’s birth place — Shivneri fort — but seven other historical forts and over 350 caves.

 An official from the tourism department told TOI that two Ashtavinayak temples — Girijatmaj, the Lenyadri Ashtavinayak Temple — and   temple in Ozar are the important attractions in Junnar besides the historical ‘samadhi’ temples and three ancient temples of Hemadpanthi architecture.
  
 “The taluka has several natural ghats like Naneghat, Daryaghat, Aneghat, apart from various natural waterfalls. Several rivers originate from Junnar. The taluka is home to Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and   at Arvi. Konkan kada, a trekking hotspot, is also situated here,” the official said.
 
  “A DPR will be prepared by the tourism department. Only after that will we know which tourism spots are to be promoted and developed here,” he said.
