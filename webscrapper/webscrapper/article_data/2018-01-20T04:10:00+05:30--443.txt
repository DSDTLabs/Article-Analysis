Vadodara: A Congress councillor has demanded an inquiry into the gas leakage that caused suffocation and burning sensation in eyes of citizens three days ago. 

 Ami Ravat, who also works for environmental causes, has written a letter to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and sought inquiry into the gas smell that wafted in areas like Chhani, Gorwa and Alkapuri on Tuesday. 
 
 “I got calls from people including senior citizens who complained about the gas smell and the burning sensation it was causing. It is a serious issue and the GPCB has to investigate it. Such incident happened last year in April as well, when gas smell was reported by citizens. There was inquiry but the source of gas wasn’t disclosed,” Ravat said.
 
 “As per environmental experts, the gas that leaked last year was definitely harmful and if the intensity of leak was higher, then it could have led to fatal disaster. Why has no action been taken against anyone?” questioned Ravat. 
 
 She has asked GPCB to make a public statement on the type of gas that leaked, the source of the gas leakage and action on those responsible.
