Ludhiana: A major tragedy was averted on Thursday when a sudden blast occurred in the furnace oil tank at Vardhman Steels Mill in Focal Point, phase 4 on Thursday. The fire brigade reached the site on time and controlled the spread of fire. The fire brigade officials said if they would not have reached the spot on time, there could have been a bigger tragedy.

 It took almost two hours for the firefighters to control the situation. No one was injured in the incident.
 
 The fire brigade officials received a call at around 8.07am and rushed to the site. According to information, an employee of the mill made the call at the control room. The fire tenders from main fire station and Focal Point fire stations rushed to the site and brought the situation under control. As per fire officials, there were three oil tanks constructed inside the factory premises and there was sudden blast in one of the tanks.
 
 In one tank, there was approximately 4,000 litres of furnace oil. The fire brigade officials claimed they controlled the spread of fire and hence the fire did not reach the other two tanks located inside the premises.
 
 Senior fire officer Srishti Nath said they are still trying to understand the reason behind the fire. “The reasons are still unknown. Since, there were fire safety as well as water supply arrangements inside the factory, the situation could be controlled well on time,” he said.
 
 Nath said they used four fire tenders and one fire tender available with the factory was also utilised.
