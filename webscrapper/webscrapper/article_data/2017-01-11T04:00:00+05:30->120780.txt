VADODARA: Although   did not officially declare the result of one seat representing the   in the registered graduates’ category of senate body, former senate member   won on the seat on Monday and made a comeback. 

 The university could not officially declare the result of this seat as the   earlier in the day had directed it to count the votes but keep the result declaration pending. 
 
 The Court had issued the directive after the university had approached the court seeking clarification on its recent order in which the court had directed the university to keep 82 votes which were earlier omitted from the voters list in a sealed cover. 
 
 The voters had moved the court after university had omitted their names from the voters list on the grounds that the university rules do not allow omission of names once the list is declared. 
 
 The counting for this seat had also got delayed for hours while counting of 10 other seats had got over by afternoon. 
 
 Sources, however, said that while Darji bagged 825 votes in his favour after counting, sitting senator   lost in the fray as he had bagged 712 votes – a difference of 113 votes. 
 
 Whether the votes kept in the sealed cover are counted or not, there will be no impact on the results now as Darji has got a clear edge over his rival candidate.
