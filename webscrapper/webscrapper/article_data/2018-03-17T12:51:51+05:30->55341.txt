NAGPUR: An 18-year-old girl from the city gave birth to a boy in Mumbai last month, following which an offence of rape was registered at   police station.

 The case has been now shifted to the   police station after it came to fore that the survivor was forced to have sexual relationship.
 
 Shubham Sonule, 23, has been slapped with relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, apart from rape by Mumbai police after his role in impregnating the survivor was revealed by the complainant in the case.
 
 Kotwali police, which are now set to probe the case, will soon visit Mumbai to record the survivor’s statement.
 
 Police said Sonule, who is unemployed, befriended the survivor who was also his neighbour. The two had grown close to each other before their relationship turned physical. It was during courtship that Sonule is learnt to have entered into physical relationship with the survivor repeatedly at his house, luring her with marriage promises. 
 
 The survivor’s family, however, shifted her at Nashik where her pregnancy came to fore. The survivor later moved to Mumbai where she gave birth to a baby boy. Sources at the Kotwali police station said the survivor and her family were not inclined to register offences fearing that it may jeopardise her career.
 
 Senior PI   of Kotwali police station said Sonule will be arrested soon. “We have just received the documents from Mumbai police regarding the case. The investigation will be allotted to an officer soon,” he said.
