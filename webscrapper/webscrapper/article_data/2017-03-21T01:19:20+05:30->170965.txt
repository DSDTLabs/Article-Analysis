NAVI MUMBAI: The Panvel   is yet to arrest the motorman and railway guard, who allegedly molested a physically handicapped woman advocate at   station on Saturday.

 Senior inspector Vibha Chavan, Panvel GRP, said, “We have checked the CCTV footage of the platforms, but there is no evidence of the lawyer being molested, as the incident occurred near the railway staff changing room, where there are no CCTVs.”
 
 She added they have registered an FIR against both parties, after receiving cross complaints. “We have not yet arrested the two men booked as the probe is yet to be completed.”
 
 Central Railway’s chief PRO Narendra Patil said that a department enquiry has been ordered into the incident. A verbal quarrel broke out between the advocate and her friend and the two accused, when the woman went to collect her lost handbag.
