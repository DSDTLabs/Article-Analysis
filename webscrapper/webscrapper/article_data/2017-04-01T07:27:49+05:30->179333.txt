Noida: Oppo India’s   assembling centre will reopen on Monday, April 3, the police said on Friday, quoting company officials.

 On Wednesday evening, the company had said, “We will be reopening soon and do not expect any impact on the supplies because of the production of our overseas units.” The Chinese mobile company faced workers’   at its Noida plant after a Chinese officer’s act of disrespect to the   Police officers, meanwhile, said that they were still examining the CCTV footage of the incident that triggered a massive protest and shutdown of the Noida plant. They said they would be able to comment on the issue only after collecting substantial proof in the matter.
 
 Ajay Kumar, circle officer Noida II, said the investigation was under way. “We had an emergency meeting on the issue today. We are investigating the allegations listed in the complaint and corroborating them with the CCTV footage. Things will be clear in a day or two,” he said. Kumar said that Oppo officials had told him that the Noida office would reopen on Monday.
 
 Indian workers in the company alleged that the Oppo production manager, identified by the police as Suhahu, had torn up a poster which had a picture of the Indian national flag and thrown it into a dustbin. The police had registered an FIR against Suhahu based on the workers’ complaint. The company, on the other hand, sacked the manager.
 
 On Thursday, the Noida police said that they were examining the company’s CCTV camera footage which shows Suhahu throwing ‘something’ from the table into the dustbin. The footage, however, is not clear enough to establish what was thrown into the bin.
