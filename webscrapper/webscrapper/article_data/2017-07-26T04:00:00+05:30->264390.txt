Rajkot: A seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped by some unidentified person in Moti Chirai village near Bhachau on Monday.

 The girl’s mother, who works as a labourer in Som Plywood company, lodged a complaint with the Bhachau police station. 
 
 The woman, who is a widow, told police that some person took her daughter to some isolated place near the factory and sexually assaulted her. 
 
 The victim’s family is a native of West Bengal, but presently live in Moti Chirai. 
 
 Three teams have been formed by the Bhachau police station to nab the accused. It is strongly suspected that a person living near their house could have committed the crime.
