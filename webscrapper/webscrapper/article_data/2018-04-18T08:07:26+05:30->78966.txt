LUCKNOW: Lucknow   on Tuesday reduced the passing marks criterion for LLM course from 28 marks to 24 marks.

 The decision came after the students had moved the high court and got a favourable order.
 
 The students of LLM course had moved the high court against the university for not following the PG ordinance.
 
 As per the PG ordinance, a postgraduate law student needs a minimum of 24 marks in each paper out of 70 to clear the semester. But until now, the law faculty had fixed the criterion at 28 marks.
 
 LLM students who had scored below 28 marks and failed to clear the semester exams had protested outside the law dean’s office on the campus last month.
 
 “The demand of the students was considered as directed by the court. The court had asked   to permit students to provisionally appear in the examination of the second semester,” said registrar RK Singh.
