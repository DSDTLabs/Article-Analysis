PUNE: The   on Monday   of an accused in the murder of a local   leader's brother in   on September 29, 2014. 

 The murder of Om Suresh Kadam, who owned a laundry, was a the result of a dispute between two groups over the installation of birthday flexes in Shanivarpeth. Om was the brother of Ganesh Kadam, the then president of Shiv Sena's Shanivarpeth branch. 
 
 Om was assaulted with sickles by five assailants allegedly led by Harshad Belapure and Sameer Ingle. All the assailants were arrested, the following day. Sameer, who was allegedly the first to attack Om, is in jail since then.
 
  Sameer sought parity with co-accused  , who was granted bail by a Pune sessions court on April 4, 2015. His lawyer cited the prosecution allegation that all the accused assaulted the deceased. The lawyer argued that Sameer is in jail since the past two-and-a-half years and has no criminal antecedents.
 
 Additional public prosecutor Y M Nakhwa opposed the plea, pointing out the statements recorded by the complainant and other witnesses. He argued that there were five to six eye-witnesses and the deceased had died of 43 incised wounds. A sickle was recovered from the applicant/accused (Sameer) and the role attributed to Sameer was more than that of Suraj Pingle.
 
 In her order on February 17, Justice Mridula Bhatkar of the High Court cited the FIR and the statements of witnesses and observed that the applicant/accused was present with Harshad and other accused and had called the deceased when he was talking to his friend and complainant Jaggu alias Chetan Thopte. The applicant/accused picked up quarrel with deceased and then assaulted Om Kadam with sickle first and other accused followed later.
 
 The bench said, "Considering the role attributed to applicant/accused and the postmortem report, I am of the view that the case of the applicant is distinguishable from the case of Suraj Pingle. Hence, bail application is rejected."
