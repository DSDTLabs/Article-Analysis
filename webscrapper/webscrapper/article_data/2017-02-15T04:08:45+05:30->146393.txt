NOIDA: Residents of nearly 80 villages, who had been pressing the   (GNIDA) for a solution to the problem of improper   disposal, may still have to wait longer. 

 Bhanota,  ,  ,   and Khaipur are among the villages most affected by the lack of a garbage collection and disposal system.
 
  The villages do not have a waste disposal system from the time they were acquired by GNIDA over 10 years ago.
 
 The Authority’s health and sanitation department said that despite tenders being posted to invite private bodies, no response have been received so far to take up garbage cleaning work for villages. The tender notice had been announced in December, soon after villagers had expressed their concerns to GNIDA in a meeting on December 7.
 
 “With no service provider qualifying, we will need to put up tenders again,” a GNIDA officer told TOI.
 
 As the villages no longer come under the purview of the district administration, the garbage is either thrown into local ponds, which have turned into swampy dumps, or burnt in the open, villagers said.
