HYDERABAD: Chief minister   has instructed officials to initiate measures for introducing   as a compulsory subject in all private and government schools in the state with effect from the academic year 2018-19. An Act will be passed during the ongoing assembly session in this connection.

  On Tuesday, the chief minister met the team of officials which visited Tamil Nadu to study the implementation of Tamil in educational institutions there. After eliciting their views, he discussed with them the guidelines to be framed to teach Telugu as a compulsory subject.
 
 “We have decided that Telugu will be taught as a compulsory subjects in private and government schools to save the language and protect the culture. It has become a necessity for everyone these days to study in the English medium with the changing circumstances. Children’s future should not be disturbed, and at the same time Telugu should not be neglected. This is the reason we are putting a condition that even children studying in the English medium should study Telugu as a subject,” said KCR at the meeting at  .
 
 Initially it was felt that Telugu should be made a compulsory subject till the Intermediate level. However, since the Intermediate course is not the same in all the educational institutions, it was felt it would be difficult to introduce Telugu as a compulsory language at this stage.
 
 “After studying the mother tongue policy in Tamil Nadu and Punjab, we decided to implement Telugu as a compulsory subject only till 10th standard,” he said.
 
 The CM asked   and   to prepare class wise syllabus for teaching Telugu. “The course material should have content that inculcates patriotism and ethical values among the children,” he said.
