 and her supportive brother   did a Facebook live chat with the ex-Bigg-Boss 10 contestantâ€™s fans today (January 10). With well wishes flowing in from all sides, people showed their concern for her health and asked her all sort of things like, if she considered herself a celebrity and is she is happy with what Swami Om had done inside and outside the house.
 
  Priyanka says that she is not a celebrity. She said, "Hum wo duniya chhod aaye hai, hum celebrities nahin hai (We have left that world behind, we are not celebrities)."
  
  Later, when a fan asked if she is ok with all that Swami Om had done inside the house and what he has been saying about the show and host outside the house. Priyanka says, "I don't know anything about him and haven't met him since I left the house, and will not even meet him in the coming days."
  
  She also clarified to her fans that she couldn't stay in the   house because she was unwell, and had it not been for her ill health, she would have stayed back. She also apologised for the same.
  
  "I still follow Bigg Boss every day," she added.
  
  Priyanka seemed oblivious of the news about Om Swami saying that he had slapped Salman Khan. She told the same to her fans during the live chat.
  
  
 
  
  When a fan prodded if she regrets using abusive words in the house, she said, "Everyone used bad language in the house, Lopa had called Om Swami legitimate child and mush more. My problem was that I should have used the words in English."
  
  On the request of a fan asking her, who would win the show, she said, "Bani will win it, she has a lot of support from outside."
  
  Talking about Manveer, Priyanka said, "He is playing a good game, I have taught him how to play the game. He has understood that he has to play alone and will win alone."
  
  Priyanka ended the live chat by saying that her son would grow up to be a celebrity.
