Vadodara: Union minister for human resource development Prakash Javadekar on Sunday hinted that Centre may formulate a Gujarat like law to regulate fees charged by private schools in the country. Javadekar, who was on a one-day visit to the city to attend the Atmiya International Youth Convention as chief guest, said that the schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) have already been directed not to indulge in commercial activities like sales of books and uniforms.  “CBSE schools have already been told that rules do not permit such activities,” he said while talking to media persons at Vadodara airport here.  “Gujarat government has recently passed an Act regarding fees. We will discuss that as well. While we want that private and public schools should compete in a healthy atmosphere and provide quality education to students, we also have to see that people are not looted,” he said while stressing that CBSE schools cannot charge “unreasonable” fees.  Gujarat government has recently passed the Gujarat Self-Financed School (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017 through which the upper limit of fees that private schools can charge has been fixed at Rs 15,000 for primary, Rs 25,000 for secondary and Rs 27,000 for higher secondary level.  As per the rules, those private schools that want to charge fees more than what has been prescribed in the Act, need to submit their proposal to the zonal fee regulation committees. On April 19, CBSE had asked schools to strictly comply with its affiliation bye-laws which restricts commercial activities including sales through “selected vendors”. CBSE had cited “rule 19.1 (ii) of CBSE affiliation bye-laws” which mandates that managements shall ensure that the school is run as a community service and not as a business and that commercialisation will not take place in the school in any shape whatsoever.
