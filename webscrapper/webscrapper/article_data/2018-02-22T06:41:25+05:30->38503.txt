AHMEDABAD: “I endured a tough period that lasted for years and spent one-and-a-half years behind bars. Acche din (good days) have finally arrived for me,” said P P Pandey,   of the 1982 batch. While talking to TOI, Pandey became emotional on a few occasions. At one such instant, he said: “At one stage I was ready to be hanged. Want to hang me? Come on, hang me. Just as   was hanged,   would have been hanged too.” 

 Pandey, who was an accused in the   encounter case, is now spending his time taking mock interviews of candidates who have passed the   exam. Of his discharge, Pandey said divine power helped him. He said the case had caused distress to his family as well. Pandey was the joint commissioner of police, crime branch, when the encounter occurred in June 2004. 
 
 Pandey is now looking forward to setting off on a religious tour to fulfil the vows he had made at various shrines and temples. “I had prayed at the Dewa Sharif shrine, some 25km from Lucknow, for my troubles to end. I will soon leave for the dargah. I will also visit Ajmer Sharif and temples such as Ambaji,” Pandey said.
 
 On the encounter, Pandey said he can’t say much because the matter is still sub judice. “But I can certainly say that no policeman benefited, monetarily or otherwise, from the encounter,” he said. About the buzz that encounters between 2002 and 2006 were murders for medals, Pandey said every Tom, Dick, and Harry gets medals. “Jino ne makkhi bhi nahin mari hoti hai, unko bhi medal milte hai (Those who have not even killed a fly get medals)”, Pandey said.
 
 Pandey had to resign as the in-charge DGP of Gujarat while on extension because of the case. He said he was happy to resign. “A chapter had come to an end. Now I enjoy my retired life and spend time in service of God,” he said.
