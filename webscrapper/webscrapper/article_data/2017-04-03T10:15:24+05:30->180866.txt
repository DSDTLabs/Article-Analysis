HYDERABAD: PV  's scintillating performance was savoured not only by the packed house at the Siri Fort stadium in Delhi but also her coach  .

 The former All England champion, not known to express his emotions, hugged his ward with delight and looked thrilled with Sindhu's show. "It's a very good win for Sindhu. It is one of her best. She played quite well today," Gopi told TOI.
 
 Guiding Sindhu from the courtside, the Dronacharya awardee was heard telling Sindhu to push the shuttle to the back of the court. The Indian looked a better bet on Sunday and dished out a much better show than in the   final where she had lost to  .
 
 Comparing Sunday's match with the Rio final, Gopi said that Sindhu was tactically a much-improved player now. "She played extremely well near the net and her pushes were strong. As a coach I should not reveal her tactics any further as there are more tournaments to come," Gopi said.
 
 Sindhu, who was earlier accused of throwing away matches from a winning position, displayed excellent temperament against Marin. "She pushed Marin back and did not give much chances to her. Though Marin tried hard Sindhu did not panic and controlled the pace of the game," Gopi said.
 
 The coach also acknowledged that Marin was not at her best on Sunday. "But all credit to Sindhu for the way she played," he said.
