ROHTAK: All India   Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti national chief   on Sunday said that they had been trying to push for their reservation in Haryana and the Centre and releasing of youths languishing in jails for long time, but it seems the government is serious about it for the first time.

 Talking to mediapersons at Jassia village after observing ‘Balidan Diwas’ to commemorate those who died during the 2016 Jat quota stir, Malik said though there was no time-bound delivery of promises, the state government had assured that the demands would be met at the earliest.
 
 Accusing agriculture minister O P Dhankar and cooperative minister Manish Grover of stoking the violence during Jat quota stir for their own benefit, he said, “Minister Dhankar’s kin was the one who staged a protest in Rohtak and minister Grover later planned all the arson to become the messiah of their respective communities,” Malik alleged.
 
 On the pending cases filed by finance minister  , he said the Narnaund MLA, who is a Jat, should withdraw all the cases in the interest of the community and give the youths behind bars a chance to make a fresh beginning. Patting his own back, Malik said the government had agreed to meet their demands only after they pressurized it with plans to disrupt the rally of BJP national president   in Jind.
 
 Refusing to take a back seat till government fulfilled the pending demands, Malik said they would continue to hold public meetings and brainstorming sessions till the community gets job reservation in state and centre and share in educational institutes. He also expressed hope of bringing legislation in Parliament for inclusion of Jat community in Other Backward Class category.
