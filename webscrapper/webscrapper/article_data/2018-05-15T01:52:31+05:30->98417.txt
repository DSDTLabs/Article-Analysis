NEW DELHI: An unruly passenger can be agitated due to genuine reasons - like a  , for instance - and employees should try to soothe frayed nerves in such situations instead of asking flyers to give apology letters.

 
 Low-cost carrier   has sent this advisory to employees after facing complaints of its passengers being roughed up and a parliamentary panel finding the airline 'arrogant'.
 
 "In the recent past, there have been a few cases of our customers displaying unruly behaviour towards our staff (cabin crew, ground crew, and security staff). In such situations, the first action is to diffuse the situation by all possible means. Each one of you is empowered and trained to deescalate the situation. Seeking an apology letter is indeed not a step, either toward de-escalation or towards finding a solution to the situation at hand; and is most certainly not in any regulation, policy or law," Captain  , Indi-Go's fleet supervisor, has written in a mail to employees.
 
 Last month, IndiGo offloaded a man from a flight after he complained of mosquitoes on board. He was asked to apologise to the crew. In another case, a flyer was allegedly manhandled by the crew. The airline has now advised its employees to first examine why a flyer is angry and not treat every agitated passenger as unruly.
