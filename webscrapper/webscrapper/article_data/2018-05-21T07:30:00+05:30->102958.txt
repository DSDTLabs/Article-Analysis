GHAZIABAD: A police patrol team broke open a door and pulled down a man who tried to hang himself from the ceiling fan in a bid to commit suicide after a quarrel with his wife in Shastri Nagar on Sunday.

 Cab driver  , in his early twenties, had had a heated argument with his wife Pooja in the afternoon. When he locked himself up in a room and threatened to commit suicide, Pooja dialled 100 and sought police help.
 
 The nearest police response vehicle (number 2152) was informed and the patrol team reached Nikki’s house in 13 minutes from Govindpuram. Head constable Hemant Sharma, constable Nirdosh and home guard Naresh Tyagi looked through the gap in the door and found Nikki hanging from the ceiling fan and gasping for breath.
 
 The police team broke the door open and brought Nikki down. 
 
 “We got the call at 2.51pm and by 3.04pm, we were at the spot. Had we reached there one or two minutes later, we might not have been able to save Nikki. We gave him first-aid and then handed over the couple to   police for further action,” head constable Sharma said.
 
 A senior officer at Kavi Nagar police station said Nikki had been booked under Section 151 (arrest to prevent the commission of cognisable offences) of the IPC. 
 
 He would be presented before a magistrate for further action, the officer added.
