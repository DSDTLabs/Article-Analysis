AGRA: In a major relief for students, the Uttar Pradesh Board of High School and Intermediate Education announced that this year class X and XII students will also be able to download their admit cards from its official website. 

 While talking to TOI in this regard, district inspector of schools (DIOS) Jitendra Yadav said that students will have to attest the admit cards from their respective schools and only after that they will be allowed to use the admit cards downloaded from the website.
 
 "If any student mistakenly loses his/her admit card then he/she can download it from the   website," he said.
 
 According to teachers, the initiative will help many students in term of saving time during exams, as students are busy with their preparation.
