 was the first to let you know about director Suni and actor Ganesh teaming up for #Chamak. Here's more from that film.   girl   will star opposite Golden Star in the film. Confirming this after sharing an exclusive picture of the lead pair, Suni says, 'As always, I was on the lookout for a Kannadiga heroine for #Chamak. When I saw the trailer of Kirik Party, I was impressed by Rashmika. On enquiring about her with Sachin, the editor of the film, I felt she was apt for my subject. Her role as   has become popular with audiences and she will be seen in a similar role here.'
Rashmika is elated. 'I can't believe I can be this lucky. It's daunting sometimes! To do films with people like Rakshit, Ganesh and other big heroes is a dream come true for any newcomer. So, I'd be crazy to not agree to a combination of Suni and Ganesh. I loved his Simplag Ondu Love Story and, more recently, the teaser of Operation Alamelamma,' says Rashmika.
