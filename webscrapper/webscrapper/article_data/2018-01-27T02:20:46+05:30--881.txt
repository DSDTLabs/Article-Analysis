NEW DELHI: A dreaded   wanted for the double murder of his rivals at Bindapur has been arrested by the crime branch. The 29-year-old accused,  , was a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang of southwest Delhi. He had earlier been arrested, but jumped parole and started operating from Uttar Pradesh. A few days ago, his gang had been cornered during which he fired at policemen and escaped.

 Gabbar was arrested from Nala Road between Najafgarh-Kakrola on January 20 by a team led by ACP Aditya Gautam, DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh said. He tried to shoot at the cops, but they managed to nab him before he could pull out his gun.
 
 “In September 2016, Gabbar was released on parole for his wife’s treatment, but he absconded to his native place Shikohabad in Uttar Pradesh,” an officer said. Subsequently, he was declared a proclaimed offender by a trial court.
 
 Yadav is wanted in several criminal cases, including the recent shootout in Shikohabad in which he fled from a guesthouse during cross-firing with UP Police on January 18. One of his gang members and two police constables sustained bullet injuries during the encounter.
 
 It is learnt that in 2008 Gabbar came in contact with another dreaded gangster, Shiva Suri, and joined his gang. “The Suri gang is active in west, southwest and Dwarka districts in Delhi and extorts from businessmen and traders,” DCP Singh said.
 
 This gang had a rivalry with the Bijender alias Bidi gang over extorting money in the area. The Suri gang conspired to eliminate Bijender in March 2015. They called him to Bindapur to resolve issues. But Gabbar, Suri, Pradeep Rana and Nitin Narula shot dead Bijender and his associate Ashu Tomar when they reached there.
