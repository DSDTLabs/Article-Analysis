Panaji: Members of the Sattari Shetkari Manch are planning to write to the government with regards to KFD-related deaths in the state. According to them, the vaccines given to prevent Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also called monkey fever, are not very effective and efforts are to be made to curb the virus by way of controlling the monkey population. Since January, over 70 cases of KFD have been detected, including one each at Patradevi in Pernem taluka and Savoi-Verem in Ponda taluka. “The KFD virus carrying monkeys have penetrated our cashew orchards; their corpses are often discovered here. If they move into settlement areas, people will be at potential risk,” said member of the manch, Milind Gadgil said. “We will write a petition to the government regarding the KFD issue. If this problem is not controlled, it can prove to be a serious threat to human life, especially in Sattari,” said advocate S N Joshi. Rohan Joshi of the all Goa farmer’s sangh said that more efforts are required to control the disease. “Only giving vaccines and sterilizing monkeys won’t help control the virus. The epidemic needs to be controlled by culling monkeys,” he said. The sangh is thus likely to request the government to grant licenses renewals to farmers using guns to tackle animal attacks. “Gun licenses to manage the wild animals that attack crops are not being granted by the collectorate and revenue department. This is because the owners of these guns are farmers who live near wildlife sanctuaries in Sattari. We will request the government to allow us to renew our licenses,” Joshi said.
