NEW DELHI:   will make a comeback in India as the Japanese car maker looks for a more aggressive play in the premium-end, while staying away from mass-market segment categories that are dominated by Maruti   and  .   has been struggling to maintain growth in India and has reported negative numbers for the last 15 months in a row. It will also drive in a new compact SUV -WR-V -based on the Jazz platform, Yoichiro Ueno, MD & CEO of the Indian subsidiary, told TOI here.

 Ueno said the company had attempted to enter mass-market segments in the previous years with models such as Brio mini, but could not experience encouraging growth due to heightened competition from established players. 
 
 The brand positioning is thus being scaled up. "We now have a strategy to maintain our traditional positioning, which is a bit more premium though not luxury. So, we would like to target customers a bit different from   or Hyundai. We would like to do that in terms of products, service, and customer experience." Petrol-only Civic had been one of the most-recognisable cars from the brand, but was moved out from the country around 2012 when the market had shifted to diesel. 
 
 With petrol gaining traction in the market once again following decontrol of fuel prices, the company is now keen to reintroduce the car here.
 
 "We are keen... but we need some time to study and some period to meet the regulations for India," Ueno said, when asked about plans for the launch of Civic in India. The model is expected to be launched within a year. Ueno said WR-V will be launched "pretty soon."
