TRICHY: While the ban on entry of heavy vehicles is aimed at preventing traffic congestion, the unchecked violations committed by motorised fish carts may endanger the objective of ban. Since certain number of motorised fish carts were used by traders in Gandhi market to transport their produce, locals have urged the district administration as well as city traffic police department to act tough against them.

 Sources said that based on a public interest litigation (PIL), the Madras high court several years ago had banned the plying of motorised fish carts. However, the illegal vehicles plying on the roads without any tail lights and head lamps are growing in number across Gandhi market,   and   vicinity. Locals charged that traders were making use of such vehicles due to lower transportation cost while the traffic police refuse to take stern action against the offenders.
 
 “Going by the provisions available in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, motorised fish carts commit as many as nine violations. Traffic police should seize such vehicles but unfortunately, many of the are still used to transport protruding goods,” M Sekaran, member, road safety council said.
 
 Though traffic police sources said that goods’ carriers with protruding elements can be prosecuted under Section 190 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 and a penalty up to Rs 2,500 can be levied, enforcing the punishment is found to be very less in Gandhi market locality. A majority of motorised fish carts are not only unsafe to the rider but also for pedestrians and others since such vehicles do not have proper control and stability.
 
 When contacted, a senior traffic police official said, “We have been seizing the engines of motorised fish carts as they are illegal as per The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Monitoring their presence for legal action would be improved in and around Gandhi market locality.”
