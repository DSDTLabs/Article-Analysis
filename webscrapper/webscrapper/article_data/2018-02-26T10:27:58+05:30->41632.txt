LUCKNOW/SHAHJAHANPUR: A dreaded  ,   alias Leelu alias Fauji, who was wanted in over 19 cases of murder, robbery and extortion in three states was killed by UP   in a joint operation with Lakhimpur Kheri police on Saturday night.

 STF attempted to arrest   near Oyl canal area but the gangster and his aide opened fire on them. Chaudhary was shot and killed while his aide escaped. Chaudhary was wanted in UP, Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana.
 
 STF had been trying to locate him ever since he escaped from police custody in 2015 from Haryana.
 
 On Saturday, Inspector   from STF got information about the presence of Chaudhary in Oyl Kasba of Kheri district. He immediately initiated an operation with the support of Inspector Deepak Shukla and his team from Kheri Kotwali police station and started combing the area where they were getting the mobile location of the gangster.
 
 When the police team reached near the Oyl canal, they found Chaudhary with his aide and when the police asked them to surrender, the criminals allegedly opened fire. In the ensuing gunfight, Chaudhary was shot dead.
 
 
 His pistol and some bullets were found near him. Blood stains on the site indicate the second gangster, who escaped, was injured, police officers said, adding that they expected to arrest him shortly.
 
 
 “A bike with a Delhi registration number has been found at the spot. We are trying to find the details about the bike’s owner to check whether it belonged to any associate of Chaudhary, or if it had been stolen,” said a police officer.
 
 
 Chaudhary, 35, hailed from Hapur in Uttar Pradesh. He was active in Mathura, Delhi, Bharatpur and many districts of Haryana. There was a bounty of Rs 30,000 by Rajasthan Police on him, while UP Police had announced a reward of Rs 25,000.
 
 
 He was considered the backbone of Sahun gang of Haryana. The gang leader Sahun was nabbed in 2017 and has been in jail since then, though his gang is still active.
