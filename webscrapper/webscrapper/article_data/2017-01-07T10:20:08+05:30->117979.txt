HYDERABAD: Without public participation, it is impossible for the government to control illegal structures, said M  , managing director, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) on Friday. 

 Speaking at the inauguration of a two-day all-India seminar on Disasters-Mitigation of Floods and Urban Drainage Issues at Visvesvaraya Bhavan, Khairatabad, he said that despite the government making policies to control illegal structures, builders are violating them. The proof, he said, lies in the recent incident where the collapse of an illegal structure in   left 11 dead. 
 
 While highlighting the severity of the situation, water board officials pointed out how hundreds of residents from Nizampet and its surroundings areas were left homeless after their apartments were inundated in flash floods last September. This happened due to nalas being encroached upon by builders who constructed apartments in violation of the buildings norms. 
 
  The water board spends crore of rupees to either maintain or replace the damaged sewer network. The delegates who attended the seminar will have to submit their papers and suggestions to the government on mitigating floods, the MD said. A senior scientist from the   (NRSA), Hyderabad, P Manjusree, meanwhile, submitted a paper on 'Geo-spatial   in the seminar. There were others too who submitted various papers. Around 200 people participated in the seminar.
