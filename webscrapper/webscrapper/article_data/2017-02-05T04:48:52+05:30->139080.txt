BENGALURU: Former Union minister  , who dropped a bombshell last week by saying goodbye to Congress, is now playing hard to get with the state   leaders, who are pulling all stops to get him on board.

 Even as the prominent Vokkaliga face is keeping his cards close to his chest, state BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa announced in Kalaburagi on Saturday, “Krishna will be joining BJP, there are no doubts about it.” Yeddyurappa said he will fix a meeting with Krishna for discussion on Sunday.
 
 However, sources close to Krishna said no meeting had been scheduled with Yeddyurappa so far. “Krishna has not imposed any conditions to join BJP. Krishna admires PM Narendra   and has appreciated his policies. This will bring him to BJP,” Yeddyurappa said.
 
 BJP sources maintained that the party’s central leaders had been holding discussions with Krishna for the last few weeks and that no state leader is involved. Even the state BJP brass is clueless whether Krishna will finally join the party. Krishna is supposed to have told BJP functionaries that he was 84 years old and wanted to know what they expected from him. He was reportedly told he would be given the respect befitting his stature if he joins the party.
 
 While political circles expected Krishna’s exit from Congress to create ripples in the party, things have been placid, though there have been some murmurs in Congress for letting go a veteran who was the face of the Vokkaligas in the party.
 
 It was a phone call from Krishna to Modi to congratulate him on demonetisation and also to BJP chief   which is said to have set in motion the process of his exit. Local BJP members admitted that Krishna’s interactions were happening with the central leadership and a family member was helping out. BJP sources said Krishna will be a prize catch as it would help the party shed its Lingayat-centric image.
