Salma Hayek, who defies the laws of ageing, belted out a rather unusual look at the red carpet of the 70th Cannes Film Festival. The 50-year-old actress showed up at the Kering   in Motion Awards Dinner at the film fest on Sunday May 21, rocking a hair colour that we never expected.
 
 Salma hit the red carpet with her husband François-Henri Pinault, with a   wig sitting pretty on top of her head. The new hue — somewhere between rose   and bubble gum pink — coordinated perfectly with the flower embellishments on her dress. The pink wig took her style-quotient to an altogether new level, although by the next day, she was back to her trademark dark tresses.
