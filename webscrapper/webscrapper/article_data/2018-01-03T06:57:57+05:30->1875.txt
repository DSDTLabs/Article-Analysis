HYDERABAD: In a move to secure separate high court for   as early as possible,   chief minister N Chandrababu   has written to the  's acting Chief Justice  , urging him to approve one of the buildings the government has identified for housing the AP HC.

 Confirming the development, AP advocate general  , who personally carried the CM’s missive, said he handed over the letter to the CJ on Saturday.
 
 
 
 
 In his letter, Naidu requested the CJ and his colleague judges to visit   and its vicinity, inspect the proposed buildings and approve one of them for the separate HC.
 
 Once the approval of the judges is in, the state will have to modify the building in line with the requirements of a high court. The CM has urged the CJ to offer suggestions by January 31, 2018. “We will then modify the building within three months and hand it over to the judges by the end of April,” the CM reportedly said in the letter.
 
 The shifting can take place in May when the HC is closed for summer vacation and AP HC can start functioning from AP soil from June 2018, Naidu said in his letter.
 
 As constructing a permanent HC building in Amaravati is expected to take a year, AP has decided to first get the principal seat of AP HC notified at Amaravati through the President of India and then shift it to a temporary building for some time. However, setting up of the court temporarily in a building would not mean that the HC itself is temporary as there is no concept of temporary HC.
 
 Clarifying the legal position, a legal authority told TOI what is being done now is the establishment of a permanent HC in AP. As judges of the common Hyderabad HC have already exercised their options, those who opted for AP HC would be officially transferred to AP through a Presidential notification preceded by the approval of the   and the central government.
