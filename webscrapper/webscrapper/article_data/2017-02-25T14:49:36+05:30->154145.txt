 I am a 21-year-old man and I've just entered the   with an amazing job. My problem is that I am suffering from   since childhood. Sometimes, I find it difficult to give an appropriate answer to a question asked even during a casual conversation. I have been single all my life and I think my social anxiety is to be blamed for this. I also feel that I am an introvert and find it difficult to strike   with people. Please help me to figure out what I am actually going through. 
 
 
  
  Congratulations on your job. I do agree that social anxiety is a crippling condition as it has both psychological and physical setbacks. However, the good news is that you are aware of your condition and therefore, can start with the required changes to correct the situation. Please understand that this is a slow process, almost like some one day at a time project. Here are a few suggestions, please enroll for a group class, like painting, book club or exercising. This could be a twice a week schedule. The idea is to be with a small group of people in a constructive activity. Try to talk to a person in the group, remember you are not going to address the whole group. If you like to teach, then you could probably volunteer to help a few children in your locality. The focus as you may understand is for you to gently broaden your horizon to be able to communicate with different people with ease. Try to pay attention to the activity that you are engaged in, rather than your physiological reactions to the situation. Good luck.
