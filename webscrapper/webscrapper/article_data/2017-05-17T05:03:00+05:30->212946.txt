GHAZIABAD: Four miscreants were arrested here on Tuesday for snatching mobile phones from train passengers. The thieves’ modus operandi was to first hit their victims’ hands with a stick while sitting on the train floor and then snatch their phones.

 The gang members also used to pick the pockets of people after waiting for them to enter a secluded spot.
 
 The accused have been identified as Ravi, a resident of Janpad; Suresh, a resident of Arthala; Dipu and  , who are both residents of Vasundhara,  .
 
 As many as five expensive mobile phones and four knives were recovered from their possession.
 
 According to police officers, the accused used to wait at the Ghaziabad railway station for the train to slow down and then as soon as a passenger holding a mobile phone in his hand would come and loosely squat near the train’s door, at the right moment they would hit his wrist/hand with a large stick that would make the phone drop from his hand and another gang member would pick it up and run away.
 
 “They committed many such thefts using the same strategy. They have also been active around Noida, Indirapuram and other parts of NCR where they have robbed people of their valuables and wallets at knifepoint,” said Sudhir Tyagi, SHO, Sahibabad police station.
 
 The accused were arrested after a tip-off of their next activity was received by an informer.
 
 The accused have been sent to judicial custody following an FIR.
