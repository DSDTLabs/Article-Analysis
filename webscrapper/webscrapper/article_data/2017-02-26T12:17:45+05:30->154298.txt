CHHAPRA: The state road construction department has sent to the Centre a proposal for a double decker  , said Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy on Saturday.

 Rudy said the Rs250-crore proposal was discussed at a meeting he had with deputy CM and road construction department minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in Patna recently.
 
 Union minister of road transport and highway Nitin Gadkari had also hinted at the proposal during his visit to Chhapra in October 2016 to inaugurate a driving school.
 
 Rudy said the proposed 4km-long   would cross through at least six busiest and narrow markets of the town and that would save precious time of commuters. “The flyover, proposed to start from Bhikhari Thakur Chowk, will cross  , Mouna Chowk, Salempur, Rajendra Chowk, Sri Nandan Path and bus stand before ending at the main road zila school,” Rudy said.
 
 According to an estimate, about 2.5 lakh vehicles negotiate through this narrow road every day, causing disruption in day-to-day works, particularly in night after opening of traffic for heavy trucks. 
 
 Other than the flyover, a proposal for some road overbridges (ROB) at the estimated cost of Rs150 crore has also been sent to the Centre. The overbridges are proposed over Level Crossing No.32 on Chhapra-Sonepur section, LC 7 at Paterhi and LC 34 at Shyam Koria (On Chhapra-Mashrakh section).
