MARGAO: The  , on Monday, condemned the allegations made against its legislators by Goencho Avaaz, an umbrella organisation of various social organisations, of having been involved in illegalities in RP-2021 as “baseless, false and fabricated” and termed it as an exercise aimed at tarnishing the party’s image. 

 Senior South Goa BJP functionary Sharmad   told reporters that the party would stand behind its beleaguered MLAs.
 
 “I have spoken to all BJP MLAs accused at the public meeting. Any charges should be backed by sound documentary evidence. We strongly condemn the baseless allegations made against our MLAs…All our MLAs are ready to come on an open platform to discuss the charges,” Raiturkar said, adding that the party would back its MLAs who have decided to file defamation cases.
 
 Citing the case of its Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral, Raiturkar said that the 40,000sqm of land at Verna plateau, purportedly shown to have been converted into industrial zone, has been shown as industrial zone even in RP 2001.
 
 Raiturkar, pointing to media reports about the Church seeking to convert nearly 5 lakh sqm of land owned by it, questioned the silence of ‘Goencho Avaaz’ over such cases, accusing it of being selective in exposing the “fabricated” illegalities. 
 
 “Of the 5 lakh sq m land sought to be converted by the Church, only 1.30 lakh sqm has been converted. Nearly 3.36 sq m could not be converted. One wonders if the failure of the Church in getting this agricultural/orchard/natural cover converted into settlement zone has driven it to deploy such pressure tactics. And when those levelling defamatory charges are silent on this, doubts arise about the sincerity of their purpose,” Raiturkar said.
 
 In reply to criticism over their silence over conversion of areas owned by the Church, Abhijit Prabhudessai of Goencho Avaaz accused “vested interests” of levelling such charges.
