Pune: Vizitech Solutions, a city-based financial technology firm, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Chaintope, a Japanese blockchain startup, to set up a blockchain research and development (R&D) centre in Pune. The aim is to develop skill sets for blockchain in India and carrying out innovative research to aide Chaintope’s ongoing international projects.

 Blockchain is a ledger system, which eliminates intermediaries and middlemen, to provide a system that cannot be hacked.
 
 Anandsagar Shiralkar, the founder and CEO of Vizitech Solutions, and Hideki Shoda, the Founder of Chaintope, signed the MoU. Shoda said Pune was the ideal location for the R&D centre due to the availability of talented engineers, many of whom are already working on the blockchain.
 
 Shiralkar said the scope for blockchain in India is vast. “While blockchain is only in nascent stages, it could become a $3billion-$5 billion market in India in the coming years. Several state governments, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, are keen on incorporating blockchain into their governance systems to improve transparency. Blockchain can be incorporated into e-governance, financial services, logistical services, energy dealing as well as land dealings and real estate, thus providing immense business opportunity in the future,” he explained.
 
 He added the centre will not only focus on research but also train manpower in blockchain application development. “Of the initial 20 engineers, three will be selected and sent to Japan for in-depth training in blockchain application development. These engineers will then train the others and conduct research for ongoing projects,” he said
 
 Shiralkar said Vizitech has already launched an online module on blockchain, which has been accessed by nearly 16,000 people across the globe. “As blockchain is comparatively new and complex, there is a need to spread awareness about this revolutionary technology,” he stated.
