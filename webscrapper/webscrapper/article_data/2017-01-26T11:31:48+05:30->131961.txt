BENGALURU: The two stone mantapas that were unearthed during   work in Hosakerehalli Lake, South Bengaluru, on Monday are likely to be more than 800 years old, say  .

 Experts from the state archaeology department who inspected the structures on Wednesday said the architecture of the mantapas resembled the Chola style and was definitely much older than the Kempegowda era. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, R Gopal, director, state archaeology department, said the mantapas’ step style and its curvature belong to the Chola period. “The structures are likely to be 800-1000 years old. Mantapas built during Kempegowda era had gopuras and the ones found in the lake don’t have the same. I have ordered the civic agencies to clear the silt covering the foot of the mantapas. There are chances that there may be inscriptions there, and the same can throw more light on their history,” he added. 
 
 The mantapas, locally known was Gangammana Thottilu (the cradle of Ganga), were unearthed during desilting work in the lake. The waterbody is being developed and rejuvenated. 
 
 The four-pillared structures holding together the roof and floor made of stone slabs are adorned with floral carvings. Their rooftop, with a depression, does appear like a cradle. Ever since they have been spotted, the mantapas have been the centre of attraction, with people thronging the place.
 
 “Similar mantapas, in various shapes and styles, can be found on lakebeds in places like Devikere in Mysuru, Melkote, Manmathakonda of Hampi, Malebennur in Davanagere,” added Gopal.
 
 Asked if the state archaeology department will take the mantapas under its custody, Gopal said: “We will take a call on that only after the excavation is over. If the architecture is really interesting and the inscriptions reveal more, we could consider taking over the structures.”
