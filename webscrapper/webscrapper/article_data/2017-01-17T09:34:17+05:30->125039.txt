CHENNAI: Driving schools have moved the   assailing the increase in fee for driving licence, licence to drive transport vehicles and renewal.

 Calling it steep and arbitrary that would adversely affect economically backward people, the Tamil Nadu Driving Schools Owners Federation (TNDSOF) has prayed that the December 29, 2016 central notification amending Rule 32 and fixing a new fee structure be declared illegal.
 
 A division bench of Justice S Nagamuthu and  , before which the TNDSOF petition came up for admission, ordered notices to the Centre and state governments and posted the hearing to January 23.
 
 The TNDSOF said most people who learned driving were from economically backward classes and did so to secure employment.
 
 Section 110 of the Motor Vehicles Act does not confer any jurisdiction or power to the Centre to make amendment relating to the fee prescribed under Rule 32 of the act, the petition said, adding that the impugned notification was void ab initio.
 
 Noting that fee structure had been increased in ‘epic proportion’, the petition said people connected with driving schools and those holding driving licences, besides the learners, had been put to serious hardship and inconvenience.
 
 The Centre levies and collects excise duty for each vehicle at the manufacturer’s point, and when it is sold from the dealers point, the end-user pays value added tax (VAT). The buyer is also liable to pay road tax. Consumers pay further tax on the fuel, which includes excise and VAT, the federation said, adding that under the circumstances, the governments should issue the licence after collecting a nominal fee instead of raising them manifold. “The increase of licence fees is against welfare of society,” it said.
