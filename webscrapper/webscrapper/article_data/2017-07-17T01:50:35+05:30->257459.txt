NEW DELHI: A day after four workers died of   while   a ‘rainwater harvesting tank’ in south Delhi’s  , two persons were arrested on Sunday.

 Niranjan Singh (42), supervisor at Mehta Farm, and Ridhipal (47), a gardener, have been arrested, said  , additional deputy commissioner of police (south). 
 
 The tank, which was originally meant for harvesting rainwater, was filled with filth and sewage that hadn’t been cleaned for long. A case under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered against J K Mehta, owner of farm, Niranjan and Ridhipal late on Saturday.
 
 The police said that on the instruction of the owner, Niranjan had called Swarn Singh to clean the tank but did not ensure safety of workers. Jaspal Singh, who fell unconscious but survived, told the police that Niranjan had insisted them to enter the pit without any safety gear. 
 
 Ridhipal allegedly assisted Niranjan in the work and also did nothing to ensure the workers’ safety, cops said. 
 
 Around 10am on Saturday, five men had gone down to clean the tank at a building under construction but four of them did not come out alive. They were pulled out unconscious by fire department personnel after an hour-long operation. It is suspected that they inhaled toxic gases inside the tank. 
 
 The police said Swarn Singh was a contractor who used to deal with water boring work while other victims — Anil, Balwinder and Deepu — were labourers. Another labourer, Lokesh, informed the police when the victims didn’t come out and Jaspal fell unconscious while trying to go inside.
