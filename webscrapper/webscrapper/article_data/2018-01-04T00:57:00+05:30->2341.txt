Mangaluru: The policy of ‘soft-Talibanism’ adopted by the Congress government in Karnataka is resulting in the frequent murders of Hindu activists across the state and Deepak Rao is the latest victim, said state BJP general secretary C T Ravi. The move by the state cabinet to repeal more than 175 cases booked against ‘communal’ PFI and its associate ‘KFD’ involving more than 1,600 accused has resulted in giving these forces a free run against Hindu workers, he noted. Noting that BJP has lost faith in the state government and its agencies to provide justice to these slain workers, Ravi, who visited the mortuary where Deepak’s body was brought, said the NIA must take charge of the probe. “The government which provided compensation of Rs 10 lakh to a known cattle smuggler killed in police action must give compensation of at least Rs 25 lakh to Deepak’s kin,” he said. Accusing the Siddaramaiah government of hobnobbing with ‘communal’ PFI for political gains, Ravi said a majority of the 24 plus murders of Hindu activists that have taken place since Congress came to power are identical in nature. “It is imperative that the nexus that is funding, aiding and abetting these elements who target Hindu activists with such impunity be broken in the first place and the perpetrators dealt with full force of law,” Ravi noted. Taking pot shots at forces that accused the BJP of being the torchbearers of Hindutva, Ravi said absence of leaders of any other political party at the mortuary indicates the kind of hypocrisy they deal in. “However, these very leaders have no qualms in rushing to the houses of members of minority community who fall prey to such incidents in DK or elsewhere in Karnataka,” he noted.
