NEW DELHI: The opposition is not sure of its numbers in   as it seeks to press amendments to the President's address to the joint sitting of   in a bid to embarrass the government over   on Tuesday. 

 Sources said a big chunk of MPs in the upper House is absent owing to elections in   and  . It includes MPs from  , SP and BSP. 
 
 There are doubts about the bench strength of a combined opposition when amendments to the joint address come up for voting on Tuesday evening. CPM, Trinamool and Congress have moved to insert in the President's address a regret that it did not mention the deaths caused by demonetisation, the black money recovered after the currency ban and the achievements of the initiative.
 
 The amendments are designed to portray demonetisation as "anti-people" and removed from the logic of economics as claimed by the government. Sources said the opposition will count its numbers on Tuesday before taking a final decision on amendments.
 
  "If we don't have the numbers, we will speak on the amendments but not press them," a senior leader said.
 
  A failure to push through the amendments will be a setback for the opposition which had planned to change the President's speech for the third successive year to question the Centre on its policy moves. 
 
 While the amendment in 2015 spoke about the Centre failing to recover black money, the next year it questioned the prescription of educational criteria for contesting panchayat elections as enacted by BJP-ruled states.
