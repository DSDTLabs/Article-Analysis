PANAJI: The southwest   hit Kerala on Tuesday, fuelling expectations of its early arrival in Goa. 

 "We expect the monsoon to hit Goa by June 6, or perhaps one or two days earlier or later," said M L Sahu, director, IMD,  . He said that the exact date cannot be forecast, adding that the arrival depends on conditions over the next few days. It usually takes about a week for the monsoon to traverse from Kerala to Goa. On a few occasions in the past, it has arrived in five days to a week, when the moisture incursion encouraged heavy rainfall. 
 
 In 2016, the monsoon weakened after reaching Karwar, and reached Goa 13 days late, on June 19. In 2017, the monsoon reached Goa on June 8, two days later than normal, but earlier than predicted by the IMD. 
 
 Tuesday morning saw a heavily overcast sky, prompting expectations of showers, but the day was mostly dry, and only in the evening did the state see some rainfall. The cloudy conditions were caused by a well-marked low pressure area over the southeast   and adjoining region, with an associated cyclonic circulation.
