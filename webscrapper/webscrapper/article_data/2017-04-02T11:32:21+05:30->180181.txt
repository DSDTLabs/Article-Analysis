NEW DELHI: Several Pakistanis, including the country's former interior minister, fell for an April Fool's Day 'fake news' reports a newspaper published yesterday.

 The Express Tribune published a most serious sounding report yesterday, April 1, that a new airport, soon to be inaugurated in Islamabad, was going to be named after Chinese Premier   "as a token of appreciation for the multi-billion dollar  ". 
 
 The report had a fake quote from an unnamed leader from the ruling PML (N) party. 
 
 "Party leaders believe that naming Islamabad airport after the Chinese president is a great gesture," the fake news report said.
 
 It even printed a fake tweet from cricketer-turned politician  .
 
  
  
 
 The report led to opposition PPP leader   expressing "serious reservations" about the idea. He warned Pakistan's   government that his party would take the issue to an "extreme level" if it tried to the rename the airport currently named after late PPP chairperson  , The Express News Tribune reported today, in a real news story.
 
 "The government should avoid taking any steps which may hurt the feelings of the public. There is no precedent in the past to rename organizations [or facilities] which are named after national heroes," an outraged Malik said in a statement issued to the media marked "very important". 
 
 
 Not just Malik, many others, especially Pakistanis and Indians were fooled, as the former posted outrage and the latter ridicule, on Twitter.
 
  
  
 
 This Swedish writer who was blacklisted in China was nonplussed.
 
  
  
 
 This Pakistani was definitely annoyed.
 
  
  
 
 This Indian who has some experience with India's numerous film awards said:
 
  
  
 
 This Tweeter thought China and Pakistan were getting too close for (India's) comfort.
 
  
  
 
 This one also implied too close a connection between Islamabad and Beijing.
 
  
  
 
 If only they had all read to the end of The Express Tribune's Story, they would have seen this.
