PATNA: Former CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram   on Saturday slammed the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in the state for the “drop in conviction rate in cases registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act”. “Nitish is showing love for dalits only because the general elections are round the corner,” Manjhi said.

 “The conviction rate in cases under the SC/ST Act is 20% at the national level, while it is just 0.86% in Bihar, the lowest in the country,” Manjhi said while citing the annual report released by the ministry of social justice in 2017. He added of the 25,943 cases related to atrocities on dalits in Bihar, judgments were pronounced only in 1,443 cases.
 
 “The rate of conviction is also shocking. Of the 1,443 cases in which judgments were pronounced in 2017, only 89 people were convicted and 1,356 acquitted,” Manjhi said.
 
 He said instead of filing a review petition in the Supreme Court against dilution of SC/ST Act, the Centre should have brought an ordinance to restore the original provisions of the Act.
 
 “All SC/ST ministers at the Centre should work for including the SC/ST Act in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution, so that no one can interfere in dalits’ rights,” he said.
