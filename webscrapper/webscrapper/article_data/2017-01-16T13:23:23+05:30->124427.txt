 Tawadkar’s political career took off after he emerged victorious against   candidate Isidore Fernandes in the 2005 byelection in Poinguinim. Tawadkar, a physical training teacher, joined politics in 2005 when BJP needed a candidate to contest against Fernandes, who was part of a group that toppled the BJP government.
 
 He retained the seat in the assembly election from Poinguinim constituency in 2007. When Poinguinim was merged with Canacona constituency after delimitation, BJP nominated Tawadkar as its candidate for Canacona as the segment had a big representation of scheduled tribe community, to which he belongs. Tawadkar won the Canacona seat in the 2012 assembly election.
