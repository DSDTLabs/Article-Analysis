NEW DELHI: The   has sought a report from the   on the recent deportation of a   from Ahmedabad, an official said on Tuesday.

 The Bureau of Immigration has been asked to explain the circumstances leading to the deportation of former diplomat Kurt Vogele, a home ministry official said. Vogele, who had served in India, was deported soon after he landed in Ahmedabad on January 22.
 
 He was allegedly told he had “no right” to enter India and was “deported” without explanation. His passport was returned in Geneva.
 
 In a letter to Sibi George, Indian Ambassador to Switzerland, Vogele demanded to know the reason for the “blacklisting”.
 
 Though there was no official word on why Vogele, who in the past represented the Swiss Development Cooperation in India, was deported, media reports suggested it could be because of his association with the SDC.
 
 Reports said SDC was understood to have funded a Dalit rights organization —   — whose Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) licence was cancelled in 2016 over allegations of engaging in “undesirable activities” that could disturb harmony.
