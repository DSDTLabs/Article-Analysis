NEW DELHI: Food minister   has expressed “shock” over the move by the   to stop   to those who did not avail it for three consecutive months.

 Hitting out at food commissioner  , Hussain said the decision was taken without his approval and ordered its immediate rollback.
 
 “I am shocked. The circular to this effect says that their ration is being stopped from May 2018 and verification would now be done and their ration would be restored only if they are found to be genuine after verification. This is a strange proposition (sic),” Hussain wrote to Singh. 
 
 It is estimated that around 4 lakh ration card holders did not avail of the scheme for three months.
 
 Directing the food commissioner to revoke the decision, Hussain wrote: “(Ever) since the new food commissioner has joined, he has shown extraordinary interest and hurry in cancelling the ration cards of those beneficiaries who did not avail (of) their ration and issue fresh cards in their place. This is despite the CM’s directions that no hasty action should be taken and these cards should not be cancelled without proper verification. I am surprised by the move of the commissioner, which appears suspicious.”
 
 Hussain said the verification process should have preceded the cancellation. “It’s strange that the department has taken a reverse course. In my opinion, it is completely illegal on the part of the department to stop ration on a validly issued ration card only because a person did not avail of it for three months,” he wrote.
 
 While agreeing that some of the cancelled cards could be “bogus”, the minister pointed out that many genuine people had faced problems due to the faulty implementation of e-POS. 
 
 Food commissioner Mohanjeet Singh did not respond to calls and SMSs.
