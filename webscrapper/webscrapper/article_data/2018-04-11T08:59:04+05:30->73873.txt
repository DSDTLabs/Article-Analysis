BHOPAL: The school education department’s  , which failed to take off a week ago, would now be implemented. Decision in this regard was taken on Tuesday at the meeting of  , convened by chief minister   in the secretariat.

 An order issued by the department last month had mandated state government teachers to mark their   at schools through a GPS-based android mobile phone application — MShiksha Mitra from April 2. However, the novel idea faced stiff resistance from most of teachers.
 
 
 The app-based attendance aims at curbing chronic absenteeism among teachers that led to deterioration in quality of school education in the state. The department had directed district education officers to monitor attendance of teachers and submit report every month.
