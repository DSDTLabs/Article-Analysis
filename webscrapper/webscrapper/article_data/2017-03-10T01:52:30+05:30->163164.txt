NAVI MUMBAI: As many as 240 families residing in six   will have to vacate their flats as these building will be sealed soon after Holi, said sources. 

 The high court has directed the court receiver to evict the occupants and hand over the flats to the authorities. The buildings—Nana Park, Sulochana Apartment, Sitaram Park, Omkareshwar Apartment, Kalpana Heights and Ekvira Heights—are under possession of the court receiver for the past two years.
 
 In the recent hearing, the high court directed the court receiver to take physical possession of these structures by sealing them and transferring the possession to MIDC, on whose land these   had cropped up. 
 
 Residents are in panic over the latest development as chances of getting further relief seem bleak. They have time and again jumped the deadlines for voluntarily vacating their belongings more than once but the high court has finally given instructions to the court receiver not to allow further extensions.
 
 Speaking to TOI, MIDC deputy engineer Avinash Mali said, “We have been told to take possession of the flats in these buildings from the court receiver, once they are sealed. No date has been fixed yet but we hope it will be after Holi.”
 
 Chandrakant Katkar, senior inspector of Rabale MIDC police station, said that they have not received any letter from the court receiver for police protection. “We will provide protection once we get instructions,” he added.
 
 As many as 99 buildings were declared illegal two years ago. MIDC has demolished three buildings— Shivram Apartment, Keru Plaza and Parvati Apartment— and has also sealed Ambika Apartment, Kamlakar Apartment, Moreshwar Apartment, Pandurang Apartment and Bhagatji Apartment.
