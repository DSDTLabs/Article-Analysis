 Now, the organisers, filmmaker   and singer-composer  , have roped in   to step in Puri's shoes. "We rehearsed for nearly two months with Omji. He had shared a warm equation with my guru Jagjit Singh so it was great to have him on-board. We're really going to miss him on the tour now," informs Tauseef, who will be leaving with his team for the 10-city musical tour on March 15. 
 
 Tauseef and Om had gone for biometrics for their visas on January 5 and the interview was scheduled for the following day. "Like always, Omji was in his elements and looking forward to the show. He hugged me tightly before leaving and said, 'Kaleje vich thand peh gayi' in Punjabi," reminisces Tauseef, who had trained under the late ghazal maestro for ten years since 1989.
 
 Prep with Kabir has kicked off. Ashoke reveals that the presenter will be taking the audience though the illustrious life and career of Jagjit Singh though anecdotes and experiences.
 
 "We plan to offer a tribute to Omji too during the show. There isn't a single day when we don't remember him," he signs off.
