HYDERABAD: Three senior TJAC members, including   and Nallapu Prahlad on Wednesday hinted that there was much dirty linen in the group that might be washed in full public view in the days to come. While Ravinder,   and Prahlad, its co-chair were suspended from the organisation on Tuesday, another co-convener   announced she was quitting the group in protest against what she called ' ' meted out to her by TJAC chairman Prof M Kodandaram. 

 Addressing a press conference at a hotel here, the three charged Kodandaram with being high-handed, authoritarian and unilateral in all TJAC affairs. Ravinder also hinted that some of Kodandaram's attitude towards others in TJAC could be a result of deep-rooted caste related bias as was with ignoring all advice from Prahlad on the issue of the rally and protest by unemployed on February 22. 
 
 Saying that advice from Prahlad, a senior advocate, on how to go about with the protest was ignored, Ravinder asked "When it was clear that a solution will not come from the court then why wait? Why was this advocate not of importance? Was it because he belongs to a backward community?"Ravinder also accused Prof Kodandaram of self-aggrandisement and being publicity hungry. 
 
 Prahlad said all that they wanted was that the TJAC discuss in a free and fair manner its path forward and how it intends to maintain its apolitical nature. 
 
 Tanveer Sultana said she too was one of those who spoke openly about the need for internal democracy but wondered why she was not suspended.
