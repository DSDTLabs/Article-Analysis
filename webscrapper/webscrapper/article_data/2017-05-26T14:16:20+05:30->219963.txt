DEHRADUN: Experts from Dehradun-based Wildlife   (WII) have suggested setting up of a ropeway to take pilgrims to   to avoid the noise from chopper rides to the shrine. The experts said that the ropeway over   (KWLS) could be an environment friendly alternative to helicopters whose noise disturbs animals in the sanctuary.
 
  Kedarnath shrine is situated at 3,583 m near the source of Mandakini river in Uttarakhand. The pilgrim route between Gaurikund and   passes through the Kedarnath sanctuary. The helicopter services were initiated in 2007-08 to ferry pilgrims to the shrine. Local residents and experts have raised concerns over the impact of sound produced by helicopters on wildlife in the sanctuary.
  
  The WII has recommended restricting the height of flight at 600m from the ground while the noise level should not exceed 50 decibel. The experts also suggested using laser distometers or lidar guns to monitor whether the choppers were sticking to the prescribed height. It also suggested that stress levels of animals in the sanctuary be assessed every few years to examine the impact of chopper noise on the wildlife.
  
  Research which selected Mandakini Valley as the main study site and the adjacent Kaliganga valley and   as control sites found that noise level at six sites in Mandakini Valley had a mean well above the 50 decibel upper noise limit for silent zones. The study was carried out from September to December 2015 and April to June 2016. Helicopter noise levels at different elevations and habitat types were recorded in the valley. To detect presence of wildlife species, camera traps were deployed. The research found that maximum number of flights in Mandakini Valley - 305 every day- were operating in May.
