MARGAO: Town and country planning (TCP) minister   on Friday reiterated his commitment to 'correct the blatant illegalities done with political patronage in the Regional Plan 2021' if brought to his attention but vowed to go ahead with the regional plan. 

  Sardesai said he was "open to deleting the mistakes in the RP 2021" as he pointed out that the RPs 2001 and 2021 had been drafted in 1989 and 2009, respectively and hence, required to be still revised in tune with present day requirements. 
 
 "A settlement shown in RP 2001 has been marked as an orchard in RP 2021 which is an injustice. Traditional land owners and religious institutions have been affected. The government is open to discussions with technical experts, activists and people willing to listen to reason as we have to keep a focus on planned development," he said at an event here.
 
 Speaking to reporters a couple of hours prior to the public meeting convened at Lohia Maidan, Margao, by a citizens group called Goencho Avaaz (Goans' Voice), the TCP minister lashed out at social activists organising this meet accusing them of "misleading the public on a huge scale" as he defended the TCP Act, 1974, and refuted claims of amending this act so as to empower the people. 
 
 In a lighter vein, Sardesai said, "The government is seriously looking at making it a part of the academic curriculum so that students can educate their parents as it is said 'child is the father of man'. The building industry, comprising 33 million people, is very important as it contributes to the GDP (gross domestic product)." 
 
 Presently, business is slack but this is a transitional phase. Hence, there is a need for unanimity for planned development in Goa. Goa needs to retain the 'Brand Goa' image of a forward state."
