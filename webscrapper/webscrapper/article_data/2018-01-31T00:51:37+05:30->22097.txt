NEW DELHI: A day after the corporations   311   to  ,   across the capital seem to be   of any such development.

 South corporation’s SDMC 311 app had only 10 downloads and no complaints late till Tuesday. East corporation’s EDMC 311 had five downloads and over 25 complaints while the north corporation’s North DMC 311 had just one download and over 10 complaints from the same user. 
 
 Senior officials claimed that all services provided by the local bodies are available on the app and people would be able to register complaints using their location.“We will publicise about the app through our officials. It will enable us to understand the issues that will be resolved at the earliest,” said a senior SDMC official. 
 
 The RWAs, however, claimed that though the system has been put in place, civic bodies should concentrate on the response time to each complaint. “It is convenient now to register a complaint, but if the department continues to ignore it, then there is no point of the app,” said Ashutosh Dikshit, CEO URJA.
 
 BS Vohra, president East Delhi RWA Joint Front federation, pointed out that residents are not even aware about the app. “The local bodies should advertise so that more and more people start to use it,” he said.
 
 Mayors claimed that they have directed councillors to write letters to RWAs and hold meetings to spread awareness about the application. “As of now, all the complaints registered with the mobile app will be resolved at the earliest and officials will be made accountable. If any officials fail in their duty, we will take strict action,” said Kamaljeet Sehrawat, mayor of SDMC.
 
 Preety Agarwal, north corporation mayor said if the complaints are not responded to by the official, it would automatically be escalated. “We are still working on the app to fix a time limit for addressing any issue, however, it will be resolved in a time-bound manner,” she said.
