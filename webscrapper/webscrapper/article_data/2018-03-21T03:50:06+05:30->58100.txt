MUMBAI: Several   who were to appear for exams at centres along the   could not make it on time due to the rail roko and aggregator cab drivers’s strike. 

 At Ramnarian Ruia College, all the final exams were postponed as 80% of students could not make it in time, said principal Suhas Pednekar. Ruia College has attained autonomous status and as the exams are being conducted at college-level, they are easy to reschedule. 
 
 A first-year BMM student from the college said that she took a Harbour line train after Kurla, got off at Wadala and somehow managed to reach the college. “But more than half of the class was missing. The college decided to postpone Tuesday’s  , but the remaining exams from Wednesday will be conducted as per the schedule,” said the student.
 
 At least two Mumbai University exam centres saw some students reaching late for the morning slot. However, representatives from students’ organisations claimed that more students were affected. 
 
 As the university’s allowed-to-keep-term exams for repeaters commenced on Tuesday for first- and second-year students, MU issued a circular in the morning directing colleges to allow students who were delayed by an hour to take the exams.
 
 Tushar Desai, principal of DG Ruparel College, said that the college allowed four to five students who were delayed by an hour. “However, about the same number of students came to us after the exam got over. We did not have the authority to allow such students. We have informed the university about these students,” said Desai.
 
 An MU official said they have got confirmed complaints only from Ruparel and Siddharth College in Fort. “As this was a repeaters’ exam, MU does not collect the attendance. Colleges will know about the full attendance by Wednesday. MU will take a decision about holding exams for students who could not make it,” said the official.
