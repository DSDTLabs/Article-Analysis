AHMEDABAD:   has ruled that it   or internet search engine Google from posting any of its orders online.

  on Thursday turned down a petition filed by one Dharmraj Dave, who had urged the court to direct a law portal and tech-giant Google to delete an HC judgement from internet because such a public exhibition of the order might jeopardize his chances of migrating to Australia.
 
 According to case details, Dave was charged for murder and   in Jamnagar. A sessions court acquitted him of all charges in 2004, but the state government challenged his acquittal. In 2007, the high court confirmed his acquittal. But while he was preparing to migrate to Australia, a law portal posted Dave’s acquittal order and it could be reached through Google.
 
 Offended with this display of the order on internet, Dave requested the portal and Google India Pvt Ltd to remove the link and delete the data. 
 
 When he did not get positive response, he approached the HC and complained that the “overzealous act” of the portal to post the order online was nothing but “indisciplined and without any authority and it has adversely affected the personal and professional life of the petitioner”. 
 
 He argued that posting court orders online is the exclusive domain of court registrar, and the portal as well as Goggle have “no authority to publicly exhibit such orders”.
 
 While the law portal did not participate in the proceedings, Google’s advocate argued that the search engine was in no way connected with publication of the order on the internet and it was not in a position, both as legal and a technical matter, to comply with any of the orders.
 
 After discussing in details on who can be given copy of court orders, the HC dismissed Dave’s petition by saying that he could not point out any legal provision by which the HC can restrain anybody from publishing court orders on websites. The HC, however, permitted Dave “to take any other recourse, if available, in law”.
