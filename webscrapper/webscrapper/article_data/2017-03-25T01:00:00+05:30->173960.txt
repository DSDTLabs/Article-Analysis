We have always seen stars open about their professional and personal lives in interviews. But this new Sunday show,  , will be an interactive one with chef   hosting it. He will be cooking their favourite dish and chat with the stars. A source from the channel says, “Only actresses will be invited to the show. Chef Damu, who was always been part of cookery shows, will also play the role of an anchor in this one. He will cook their favourite dish, and in the meantime, also interview the stars. It will be fun and quirky.” Actresses like Kasturi, Sulakshana have appeared on this show.
