Singer Charlie   said he threatened the makers to pull ' ' song from 'Furious 7' if they did not feature him in the   video. 

 The 25-year-old singer co-wrote the 2015 track with rapper   and DJ Frank E, which is the soundtrack in the motor-racing film.
 
 However, when he was told by the film's bosses he could not appear on the track or the accompanying video he gave them an ultimatum, which was he either sang and featured in the songs music clip or he would not allow them to use the single in the production. 
 
 "I wasn't supposed to be on the song; I was only supposed to be a writer on the song."
 
 "I'll never forget I ended up calling them from around this big conference table on the phone, and they were explaining the reasons why it was going to be sung by this artist...I said, 'That's great. Your movie comes out in a week and I'm not going to give you the song.' And I hung up the phone and when I said that miraculously I was in the music video," Puth said. 
 
 The 'Attention' hitmaker has claimed that it was due to him not being "cool enough", as well as being a "brand new" and unknown artist that he was initially excluded from the project.
