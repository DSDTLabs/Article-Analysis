Visakhapatnam: The municipal schools of the city got a new lease of life in the last few months, thanks to the Vizag Smart City project as well as the civic body’s renewed focus on augmenting the infrastructure. 

 All the 27 municipal high schools are now equipped with digital classrooms and science labs. Apart from these projects, the GVMC will set up interactive boards in about 150 classrooms. This includes a giant interactive board and a projector to provide an access to e-contents like multimedia tutorials/animations to the students. The GVMC has also embarked on installing solar rooftops at an estimated cost of Rs 1.24 crore in 144 GVMC schools.
 
 Professional development programmes for the teachers from the municipal schools were also conducted in the run up to the class X examinations. The GVMC has spent about Rs 7 crore on renovation of these schools, including paintings, minor repairs and other requirements. While around Rs 6.3 crore was spent on the digital classrooms project, the science lab project cost the GVMC exchequer around Rs 65 lakh. 
 
 The GVMC, which has got about 30% funds under CSR for the labs, now wants to have the entire amount of the science lab project from corporate firms.
 
 GVMC commissioner M Hari Narayanan said that the most important thing they focused in 2017 was improving the atmosphere in the schools. “These projects were taken up to improve the environment of these schools and providing tools for digital education. We have instructions from the state government to provide tiles as well as water facility in all the toilets of the schools,” said Hari Narayanan.
