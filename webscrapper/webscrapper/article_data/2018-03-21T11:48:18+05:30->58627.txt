HYDERABAD: This summer, 36-year-old   has taken on a fresh mission. Pained by the cruelties that the winged creatures - particularly sparrows - are subjected to, this businessman has launched a 'Save Birds this  , which involves going from door-to-door to encourage and educate people about the need to protect birds. 

 This is coupled with the distribution of a small hut-like box, designed by Reddy himself, that's been built to nest birds and can be hung different places in a home.
 
 Already, the bird enthusiast has distributed 2,000 boxes across apartments and offices in the city to encourage citizens to build homes for birds. "I have seen people becoming more aware about the issue. Today, at least one member of a household takes care of the food and water needs of birds," he said, speaking on the occasion of  , wherein he rescued 26 sparrows from the  . 
 
 As a crusader of this cause for eight years, Reddy said how sparrows are most vulnerable and, therefore, need a place that makes them feel safe and secure. Only then do they start living there, he added, sharing how his hut-like boxes have been created largely for this species.
 
 Ruing how the city fails to provide this safety net to these tiny creatures, Reddy said: "The rising pollution and population levels make these birds feel very insecure. It is futile to celebrate sparrows only one day in a year. I suggest we have a world sparrow day every month so that people actually start caring about these birds."
 
 Sharing his journey thus far, the   resident said how his fondness towards birds grew during his childhood when his grandmother would encourage him to feed animals and insects. Today, Reddy has a farm for various domestic animals other than the nests for birds.
 
 "I owe much of my success to the support that I have received from individuals and corporate employees who've given me the opportunity to spread awareness about the issue," he said.
