 Budget receipts for 2018-19 have been set at Rs 5,197 crore, an increase of 52% over the revised estimate of 2017-18 of Rs 3,637 crore. The estimated receipt of Rs 5,197 crore was expected to be mainly from disposal of houses and shops (Rs 1,525 crore), disposal of land (Rs 2,206 crore) and miscellaneous receipts (Rs 1,466 crore), a DDA spokesperson said.
 
 “To transform Delhi into a world-class city, a request for proposal (RFP) for developing the   area available at Dwarka (200 hectares),   (259 hectares) and Narela (218 hectares) has been floated,” the spokesperson said. “Fifteen new development schemes and 14 new housing and related development work have been introduced in the budget estimate for 2018-19,” he said.
 
 DDA also plans to construct five socio-cultural centres at Rohini, Dwarka, Shahdara, Mayur Place and Netaji Subhash Place. The authority is also developing 62 acre of land surrounding the Sultangarhi Tomb Conservation Complex in   and upgrading Vasant Udyan at Vasant Kunj. DDA plans to allocate funds for the rejuvenation and restoration of Yamuna as well.
 
 Revised modalities for enhanced FAR
 
 “For optimal utilisation of commercial land, the Master Plan for Delhi 2021 recommended enhancement of the floor-area ratio (FAR) and ground coverage of commercial centres. However, stakeholders were not coming forward to avail the enhanced FAR, maybe because the process is very lengthy and cumbersome,” the spokesperson said.
 
 DDA has now decided to make the process of availing of enhanced FAR easier by making the exercise completely online. “It was felt to make apportionment of FAR simple, transparent, online with minimum human intervention. For this, a fixed factor/quotient of enhanced FAR shall be put on the website,” he said. “To promote public parking, there is also a provision of 5% additional ground coverage in MPD 2021 for multi-level parking,” he said.
 
 Flats for CISF
 
 With its one-bedroom flats finding few takers, DDA had decided to allot these to central police forces as quarters. As a part of the initiative, it will allot 794 flats to the Central Industrial Security Force.
 
 Of these , 574 are at Sector-34 Rohini and 220 at Siraspur. “Our primary aim is to allot flats to the general public but since these flats have been surrendered by allottees in two subsequent housing schemes, we decided to allot them to paramilitary or central police forces. We have sufficient stock of LIG flats in hand and we decided to allot a share of it to CISF,” a DDA official said.
