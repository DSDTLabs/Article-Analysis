NAINITAL: The   (NGT) has ordered the removal of two stone-crusher units from a populated area of Haldwani for flouting norms. The NGT order came on April 3, while hearing a petition saying stone-crusher units should not be made to operate in areas with high population. It directed the state government and the state pollution control board should to remove the plants by November 30, 2018.
 
 Dushyant  , counsel for the petitioners, said, "The NGT has ordered the relocation of the plants on grounds of violation of various guidelines, including operating in a populated area, affecting public health, etc. The NGT has also directed that the plants be removed forcefully if they don’t do it of their own accord.”
  
 The petitioners,   (75) and   (82), are residents of   village in Lalkuan area of Haldwani. They had filed the petition in February, 2017. In August, 2017, the NGT had ruled that stone-crusher units would not be allowed to operate from 8pm to 6am. The next month, the tribunal ordered that no loading or unloading of material could take place at the units after 8pm.
  
 In December 2017, the NGT had asked the central and state pollution control boards to inspect all stone-crusher units in Lalkuan and Haldwani cities of Nainital and submit their report by February 1, 2018. "The report was submitted to the tribunal and it clearly stated the adverse effect the stone-crusher plants had on public health in the areas around them,” said Mainali.
  
 One of the units were found to be situated inside a reserve forest, while many were in the vicinity of populated areas. The petitioners said that the silica dust and the noise arising from these plants badly affected the environment.
