Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL), the 50:50 joint-venture between   and US-headquartered burger chain  's, has reopened 18 out of the 43 outlets of McDonald's that were closed in the Capital due to non-renewal of health licences.

 Bakshi, who has been fighting a prolonged legal battle with McDonald's, told TOI that another three will reopen on Wednesday . CPRL runs 169 McDonald's outlets across north and east India.McDonald's recently termi nated its franchise agreement with Bakshi, who has decided to ignore the notice and keep operations running.
 
 “The board of CPRL under the chairmanship of Hon'ble Justice GS Singhvi had passed a resolution on September 17 to reopen the 21 restaurants for which health licenses have since been received,' Bakshi said. “This decision has been taken by the board of CPRL in the best interest of employees, vendors, landlords and stakeholders.“
 
 McDonald's, however, sa id CPRL “is required to cease using the McDonald's System and is no longer authorised to operate McDonald's restaurants“. It warned of taking steps to exercise its le gal and contractual rights.
 
 CPRL employs aro und 10,000 direct and indirect employees across its outlets. It was forced to shutter 43 restaurants in June, when Bakshi refused to sign for renewal of their health licenses.The licences were due for renewal in March, according to Bakshi, who was ousted by McDonald's as CPRL's MD in 2013 for alleged mismanagement of funds.
 
 The 62-year-old businessman, however, was reinstated as MD in July by an order of   ( ), after which the licences were renewed.
 
 McDonald's had earlier offered to buy out Bakshi's stake in CPRL for a sum of up to $7 million, but Bakshi had refused the offer when   valued the company at around $300 million. But last week, the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) ruled in McDonald's favour and asked Bakshi to sell his stake in CPRL.
