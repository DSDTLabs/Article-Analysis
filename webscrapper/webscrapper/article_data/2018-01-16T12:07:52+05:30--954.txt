CHANDIGARH: The   on Monday released the 10-month report card of the   government in the state, alleging that farmers, industrialists, women, and youth, were feeling betrayed.

 While releasing the report card, Punjab   vice-president   and secretary Vineet Joshi alleged during the Congress rule, 368 farmers had committed suicide so far and if chief minister   failed to wake up to reality, Punjab will turn into a graveyard for the farmers. The BJP leaders said elderly were awaiting pension and women for sugar and tea along with atta and dal. The Congress is not even doling out Rs 500 per month pension to about 19 lakh beneficiaries of the state.
 
 Grewal said, “He had promised a full farm loan waiver, Rs 10 lakh compensation for family of farmers committing suicide, Rs 20,000 per acre compensation in case of natural calamity, free education and hostel facility for the children of suicide victims and skill development of their widows; and Rs 5 lakh life and health insurance of every farmer, but nothing has been done till now.”
 
 Commenting on the issue of drugs, Joshi stated, “Amarinder Singh’s claim of weeding out drugs and controlling the gangsters has fallen flat after his own MLA   stated that drugs were easily available in every street of Punjab.”
