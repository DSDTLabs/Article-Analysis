CHENNAI: The sight of men and women hammering away at typewriter keys is rare enough in the digital age, but students at this institute in   have been doing it for the past 60 years.

 A small celebration on Monday marked the achievement at Meena’s Institute of Commerce which is also one of the few in the city using a Remington, almost a century-old. “After Tamil was nationally recognised this model came out,” says founder  , now 85.
 
 “Some of my students are now as old as 60. I can barely recognise them when they come up to greet me,” chuckles Veeraraghavan, a former government servant who has been running the institute from his 20s. Courses in shorthand, he says, were once very popular. The institute is open from 7am to 9 am and 4pm to 7 pm and also offers subjects like accountancy. 
 
 Veeraraghavan, who began charging Rs 3 in 1957 and still tries to keep fees affordable, says, “There were nearly 25 institutes in this locality. Now there are only two.” 
 
 The popularity of shorthand, observes his son Balachandran, a trained instructor, began waning after the entry of computers. “But we have a dedicated set of students, particularly government job aspirants... We hope to keep it running nevertheless,” he adds.
