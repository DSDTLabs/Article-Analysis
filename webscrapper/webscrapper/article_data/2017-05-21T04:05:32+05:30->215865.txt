SURAT: A woman took her   to a doctor at a  . The doctor who attended her was a professor and had taught almost all the   in the city, who are now doing their own private practice. 

 He was to operate on her the next day. But the daughter told her mother, “I can’t get operated at a government hospital. My in-laws and husband will lose all respect for you and father.” 
 
 Such psyche is prevalent in the society. This resulted in the woman paying Rs 50,000 for the operation at a private hospital that could have cost Rs 5,000 at the government hospital. 
 
  (PHCs) and government hospitals are looked down upon despite having all the facilities.
 
 Community awareness, motivation and mobilization is equally important, he added. 
 
 In Surat city with a population of 50 lakh, services at urban health centres (UHCs) are compromised because there is no system to monitor work of health workers or doctors. 
 
 “It is unfortunate that the community despite being an equal partner is not able to connect with government healthcare facilities,” said Dr Vikas Kishore Desai, former director of Urban Health and Climate Resilience Centre (UHCRC) 
 
 “There is a need for total revamp of the healthcare system. Services need to be efficient with quality and adequate staff. Employees need to be given attractive preposition so that they would want to own the place. Money spent on health will help build a healthy society which is the need of the hour,” said Shah.
