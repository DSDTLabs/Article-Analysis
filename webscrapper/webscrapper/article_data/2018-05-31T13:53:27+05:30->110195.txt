Ahmedabad:   police registered an FIR against unknown persons for circulating a forged letter, purportedly from the   ( ), to various government offices, asking them to inquire into the possibility of rigging of EVM machines.

 Senior police officials said the Gandhinagar superintendent of police (SP) received the letter in the last week of April, as did other departments of the state government. The letter had poor grammar and the phrasing of words raised suspicion.
 
  
 
 Senior police officials said the SP thought the letter was fake as he reads English letters that his office receives himself.
 
 “After checking with the ECI, we found that they had never written such a letter. The ECI directed us to take legal action as the letter was forged and could harm the reputation of a constitutional authority,” said  , the Gandhinagar SP.
 
 Senior officials said letters with similar content were also sent to Bathinda in Punjab, Delhi and a few other states. The other states had already registered an FIR about the fake letter, a senior police officer said.
 
 “The FIR has been registered at Sector 7 police station in Gandhinagar with its police inspector, K K Pandya, becoming the complainant,” added Yadav.
 
 Police sources said while the complaint has been lodged under sections 471, 465 and 469 of the IPC, they will also probe the conspiracy angle. “We will add section 120 (b) if evidence points to a conspiracy,” a senior police officer said.
