GURUGRAM: The move to relocate the   to make way for Iffco Chowk   project’s completion has again hit a hurdle. 

 According to   officials, a petition was filed at the district and sessions court on February 7, questioning Huda’s change of land plan in Sector 42 and allocation of the plot, marked for a taxi stand, to a petrol pump. 
 
 Huda had allotted the plot in Sector 42 to   petrol pump owner  , as the pump is coming in the alignment of the Iffco Chowk underpass. 
 
 Huda estate officer 2 Vivek Kalia said, “A stay order from the court has delayed the relocation of the petrol pump from Iffco Chowk to Sector 42. Within a few days after the Sector 42 plot was allocated, a civil suit was filed at the district and sessions court, which passed a stay order. We have apprised the court that it is an infrastructure project, and that the authority had followed government policy while changing the land plan. We’ve requested the court to withdraw the stay order.”
