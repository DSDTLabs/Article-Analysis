NEW DELHI: A week after   arrested its assistant programmer along with a private person for allegedly running a  , the agency claimed a large number of online software was being used by travel agents to trick the IRCTC booking system. 

  These software, the CBI learnt while probing its assistant programmer  , are easily available online and they work on 'auto fill' system where details of large numbers of ticket seekers are entered and kept ready even before Tatkal bookings open on the IRCTC website at 10am for trains departing the next day. 
 
  Garg had developed one such software. Sources said these software sped up the PNR generating process, bypassing the IRCTC 'captcha' and enabling login with multiple IDs, allowing a large number of ticket bookings simultaneously on a single click. They further allowed the users to fraudulently gain unauthorised access to computer networks. 
 
 "All such software are under the scanner. We are examining them and may soon take action," an official said.
 
  Apart from Garg, CBI had arrested his associate   last week for developing and distributing the software to agents for a price. Travel agents offer to provide confirmed tickets under the quota by charging a premium, over and above the railway price. The arrest of Garg and Gupta exposed the alleged software trickery used by them to exploit vulnerabilities in the IRCTC ticket booking system, sources said.
