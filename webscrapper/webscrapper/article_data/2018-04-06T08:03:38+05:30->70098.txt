AHMEDABAD: The   (FRC) formed to decide the fees for self-financed schools in Ahmedabad and north   region is likely to allow fee increases ranging from 6% to 56%. The   has approved fees ranging from Rs 16,000 to 42,000. 

 The state government under the Gujarat Self-Financed Schools Act, 2017 has decided to have a cap of Rs 15,000 for primary schools, Rs 25,000 for secondary and Rs 27,000 for higher secondary schools barring science stream. For the science stream, the government has capped the fee at Rs 30,000 per annum.
 
 The government has stated that schools which want to charge fees above the cap will need to file an application for the increase, while the other schools were supposed to file a simple affidavit informing that the fee charged by them was less than or equal to the fee caps.
 
 Sources in the FRC said that 116 schools have applied for fees higher than the cap and of these the FRC has decided to increase the fees in 91 schools.
 
 The committee has also received affidavits of 4,403 schools who have stated that their fee was less than the government cap. The officials said that the fee will be declared soon by the FRC and the FRC was checking the affidavits to see if schools had increased the fees keeping the cap in mind.
 
 Meanwhile, there are about 200 schools in the state who have neither submitted their affidavits nor have they submitted a proposal for charging fees above the cap set by the state government. The district education officer, who is also a member of the FRC, has sent notices to these schools.
