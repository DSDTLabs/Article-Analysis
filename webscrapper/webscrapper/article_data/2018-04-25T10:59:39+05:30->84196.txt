HYDERABAD: Thick smoke covered the Patencheru industrial area after a   in the wee hours of Tuesday. Though perturbed, residents say they have been inhaling smoke almost daily owing to the presence of industries in the residential area. 

 Rakesh Reddy, 33, a resident of Symphony Park Homes in Patencheru area, said he has to visit the doctor frequently because he suffers from asthma, a problem, he says, that is a result of the pollution caused by 30 industries located nearby. 
 
 "The industries release thick black smoke almost everyday, making it difficult for us even keep the windows open," said Rakesh, a software engineer. 
 
 He woke up on Tuesday morning at around 5am and saw   dousing the fire. "We are living in hell, most children here face breathing problems due to frequent fire mishaps and smoke released by these industries," said Rakesh. He said they witness an average of four minor fire mishaps almost every month. 
 
 Jagadeesh Jinka, who has spent over 70 lakh to purchase a villa in the area, says he has no option but to stay put in the area now. "We spent a huge amount of money to purchase these villas. There is no other option but to stay here. We have been making complaints to the   about the smell and the continuous smoke, but they have done little to resolve the issue. The industries not only pollute the air, but have also been polluting the   nearby, releasing their industrial waste into it," said Jagadeesh. 
 
 Residents suggest that chemical-based gas is released from late night till early mornings. There are also concrete-ready mix companies because of which the entire area remains dusty, they say.
