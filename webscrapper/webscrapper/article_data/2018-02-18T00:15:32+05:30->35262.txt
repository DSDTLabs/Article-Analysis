Pune: The   government on Saturday issued a notification approving the excluded part of the revised development plan (DP) of old city areas with modifications.

 The government has reserved the space for   stations, depot and a   hub besides approving widening of some roads. It has also sanctioned a tunnel in the Taljai hill and increased its width to 24 metres to connect Sinhagad Road.
 
 In January 2017, the government had approved the DP for the cityâ€™s old areas before the municipal polls. While sanctioning it, the government had kept the decision pending on some of the excluded parts. 
 
 The government had invited suggestions and objections on the DP and asked the town planning department to conduct hearings. Based on its report, on Saturday the government sanctioned the excluded parts with various modifications.
 
 The state government has decided to go ahead with drawing the red and blue floodline of river, as suggested by the irrigation department. It has instructed to maintain the width of High Capacity Mass Transit Route up to 24 metres. Nehru Road, Aundh Road between Pune University and Bremen Chowk and Mundhwa Road would be widened.
 
 The decision on reservation for central business zone and hilltop hill slope areas have been kept in abeyance.
