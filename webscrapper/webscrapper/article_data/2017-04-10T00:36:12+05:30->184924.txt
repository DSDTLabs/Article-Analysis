 Madurai: Besides sewage and garbage,   is also polluted with   wastes. Despite strong opposition to the dumping of construction wastes, it continues to happen in places like Arapalayam and Vandiyur, within city limits. Activists say that the dumping often takes place at night, when people are asleep.
 
 People say that the river can be saved only by fencing the water body. M Rajan from Vaigai Nathi Makkam Iyakkam says that they have caught people dumping wastes a couple of times and handed them over to the police. However such strict vigilance does not seem to act as a deterrent. 
 
 Dumping of construction wastes is rampant in Arapalayam, Vandiyur and Sourashtrapuram. They have notified the concerned officials regarding the indiscriminate dumping on several occasions, said Rajan. The best solution would be to fence the river. However, entry should not be restricted when the public want to use the many ‘padithurais’ constructed a long time ago.
 
 “Such dumping was common between the Kalpalam Bridge and AV Bridge, but after fencing the area, the problem was resolved. A similar initiative should be undertaken to protect the Vaigai river,” he said.
 
 A Palanisamy, a youngster from Vandiyur, said people residing alongside the river are encroaching the water body. They first dump soil and concrete wastes. Then put a temporary shed and develop it into a permanent one. At many spots, the river bank has been completely encroached. Civic officials should crack their whip against such encroachers, he added.
 
 When contacted, an official from the public works department said that they would soon inspect the river and take appropriate action. It would be hard to monitor the entire water body on a day to day basis. The public should come forward and help them in protecting the river, he added.
