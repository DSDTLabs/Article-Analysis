BENGALURU: The   in Karnataka and a group of professional colleges have moved the high court seeking a direction to the government and the   (KEA) to adhere to the 50:50 seat-sharing formula provided under the recently amended regulations of the   (MCI).

 The petitioners claimed as per the consensual agreement between the state government and the association for 2018-19, only 25% seats have been given in favour of colleges —15% under NRI quota and 10% under the higher fee category, which is much below and contrary to the 50:50 seat-sharing arrangement provided under the amended   brought out in April.
 
 They claimed when the state government itself is spending about Rs 30 lakh on each student pursuing medical education, there can’t be an irrational method for fixing seats and fees for UG and PG medical education.
 
 “When the institutions are sharing the state government’s burden to provide education, they cannot be made to beg and borrow money for running colleges. The government cannot force the institution to share seats charging lesser than that fixed by the apex body,” they stated.
 
 A vacation bench headed by Justice Aravind Kumar ordered notice to the state and central governments, KEA and MCI. The court observed that allotment of seats made under the consensual agreement will be subject to the result of the petition.
