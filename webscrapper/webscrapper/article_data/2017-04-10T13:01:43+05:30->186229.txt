VADODARA: For the first time, 18 women inmates of   will showcase their artworks at a city-based art gallery from Monday. The inmates had created their artworks during a weeklong workshop conducted by   to mark International Women’s Day last year.

 Eighteen inmates, both undertrial and convicted, had participated in the workshop which according to  , director of the art gallery, changed their lives. The day when the workshop had started, the ladies were shy and introvert, said Rana. But as days passed, they took to liking drawing and painting on the canvas.
 
 “By third day, the participants were so much into art creation that the jail’s sentry had to remind them that it was time for them to go back to their cells,” Rana added. The workshop was held as art therapy for the inmates to vent out their frustration or sadness on the canvas.
 
 From a 27-year-old young lady to a 62-year-old, the participants had spent three to eight years in prison. While some were convicted for domestic violence, a few were in jail for a serious offence like murder. Apart from convicted inmates, there were also undertrials arrested under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.
 
 “Their offences would have been very serious in nature but during the workshop, they were all like students, eager to draw their thoughts,” Rana said.
 
 The inmates were given the theme of house where they remembered their family members whom they had not seen in years.
