LUCKNOW: For the second day on Tuesday, commuters passing through City railway station in old Lucknow were stranded for hours, when they found both underpasses connecting to   ( ) barricaded. Hundreds of vehicles could be seen locked within a 500m radius of the underpasses. North-eastern railways (NER), who had done the barricading, said it was done to complete the work of converting metre-gauge tracks to broad-guage. 

 According to traffic officials, around two lakh vehicles commute between City station and Chowk every day. There are two railway underpasses near City railway station, which connect to roads leading to Chowk, Nakhas, Rajabazar and KGMU. The reverse carriageway connects to Kaiserbagh, Golaganj, Wazirganj and   colony. From Monday, both underpasses have been barricaded.
 
 Vehicles arriving from Golaganj and Kaiserbagh going towards Chowk and Nakhas were diverted to Riverbank colony, while vehicles arriving from Chowk were diverted towards Rajkiya Inter college. But with the road towards the college being narrow, there is chaos on both underpasses during peak morning and evening hours on normal days.
 
 On Tuesday, with no signage for diversion installed, commuters could be seen trying to take turns at random, adding to the logjam. 
 
 Commuters said there wasn't a single traffic marshal at the spot. Ronit Wadhwa of Golaganj said, "I commute to Chowk daily. Today, it took me around two hours to pass the road, only because of the traffic snarl that resulted from the barricades."
 
 SP (traffic) Ravi Shankar Nim said his department had directed NER officials to appoint traffic marshals before barricading the underpasses. He added, "We'll put cops to manage traffic on route from tomorrow."
