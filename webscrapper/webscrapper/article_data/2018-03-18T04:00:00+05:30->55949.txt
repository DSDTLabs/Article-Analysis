Vadodara: A railway staffer was robbed of Rs 1 lakh cash near Goverdhannath Haveli on BPC Road by a motorcyclist on Friday evening.

 The victim Ramesh Vasava, who works as a peon in the office of divisional railway manager, had withdrawn the cash from a bank and was returning home. Vasava had applied for a loan of Rs 1 lakh a week ago which was sanctioned by the bank. When he was passing by the Haveli, the robber told him that a cloth was stuck in his wheel for which Vasava stopped his cycle. When he was removing the cloth, a passer-by told Vasava that money had fallen from his pocket. The motorcyclist fled with the bag containing Rs 1 lakh cash.tnn
