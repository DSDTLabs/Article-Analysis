Actress   is truly under the 'Spotlight' these days.   plays the lead role in  's web series   that is seen on the digital platform VIU and has been getting a lot of appreciation from fans and critics alike. The actress has a very intricate role and the same role requires her to do intimate scenes with her co-stars on screen.
 
  We spoke to Tridha about her role in Spotlight and whether she was comfortable with bold scenes on screen to which she said, "This is a question that has left me a little perturbed. honestly, if we watch any   movie or a show or any sort of content, we do see people kissing on screen. I don't consider spotlight to have any sort of steamy, raunchy or bold scenes. Kissing scenes can't be considered as bold scenes."
  
  In the same Live conversation, we also asked Tridha about her opinion on Body shaming to which she said,"We females have to face a lot of questions like Why are you wearing this? we see a lot of news about women facing the brunt. it's the mentality of people that wrong. Nothing is wrong with women's clothing. women should be allowed to wear whatever they love to wear."
  
  In the chat Tridha also revealed that she has taken up a Telugu film and will start shooting for the same later this month.
