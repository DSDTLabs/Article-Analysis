Mumbai: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ( ), which last Friday dismissed all appeals filed by firms representing former Tata Sons chairman   and declined to stay an extraordinary general meeting of the company’s shareholders, has said that his position as director may be restored if the original plea made on his behalf is found to be maintainable by the Mumbai tribunal. 

 Significantly, NCLAT clarified that the tribunal in Mumbai has to first decide on the issue of maintainability of the plea against   by Mistry family’s firms alleging oppression of minority shareholders. According to the Mistry plea, Cyrus Investment and Sterling Investment Corporation represent minority shareholders with 18% stake in Tata Sons whose rights to be represented on the board were being oppressed. 
 
 However, Tata Sons have said the Mistry firms hold only 2.17% of the overall stake taking into account the preference shares issued by Tata Sons. The Mistry camp had moved for a waiver on this clause, but the   is yet to decide on it.
 
 The NCLAT said the maintainability hinges on the family’s plea seeking a waiver on the requirement of a minimum 10 per cent equity shareholding by minority shareholders before deciding the case. “In case the question of maintainability and/or waiver on merit is decided in favour of the appellants, it is always open to the tribunal to pass appropriate order restoring the original position of Mistry as it was at time of filing the company petition,” said the appellate tribunal bench of Justice S J Mukhopadhaya and member Balwinder Singh in their order made available on Wednesday. 
 
 Mistry’s counsel Janak Dwarkadas had Friday said they would now amend the petition filed under company law before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in Mumbai to challenge the EGM decision to vote him out as director. Mistry had been a director of Tata Sons a position he had held since 2006.
