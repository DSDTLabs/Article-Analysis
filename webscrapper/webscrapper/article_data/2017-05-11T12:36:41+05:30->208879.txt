Aaliya is upset as her mehndi didn't come dark which indicates Adi doesn't love her much. Adi thinks that Aaliya has got to know about Roshni and his marriage. He asks Aaliya to calm down and he will do something about it.
 
  He blames Roshni and thinks that she did this intentionally. He shares the same with Ishita. Ishita asks Adi to not insult Roshni like this. Roshni tells Ishita that she will apply Nilgiri oil on Aaliya's mehndi and it will get dark.
  
  Ishita calls Aaliya and informs her the same. Shagun gets irritated. She finds Ishita and Roshni illogical. Shagun wants to take Aaliya to the parlour but Aaliya insists on waiting for Roshni to come and apply oil on her mehndi.
  
  
 
  
  Adi and Romi, on the other hand, photoshop Adi and Roshni's wedding picture by replacing Adi's face with some random man so that she can show this to Ishita. They get relieved after she shows it to Ishita.
  
  Everyone is busy preparing for Adi and Aaliya's haldi function. Roshni prepares organic turmeric paste for Aaliya.
  
  Roshni then applies the oil on Aaliya's mehndi. Roshni tells Aaliya that she is lucky to have Adi as her husband. She tells Aaliya to always have faith on him. The mehndi turns out dark and Aaliya is happy. She hugs Roshni. She wishes Roshni gets a husband just like Adi.
