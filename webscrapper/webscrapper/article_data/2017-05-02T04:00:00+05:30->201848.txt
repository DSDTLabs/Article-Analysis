AHMEDABAD: After a pregnant student of the MSW department of   filed a complaint for mental harassment against faculty member Vaishali Acharya, an internal complaints committee (ICC) was formed by the varsity to probe the matter. Varsity officials said the ICC will call the complainant — a fourth semester PG student — and Acharya for questioning on Tuesday.

 “The student will first be called for a hearing by the ICC. Acharya will be questioned after that,” said Himanshu Pandya, vice chancellor, Gujarat University.
 
 Well-placed sources in the university said some 40 other students also gave complaints against Acharya, in writing, to the vice chancellor recently, alleging maltreatment. If needed, some of these students will also be called for a hearing.
 
 The pregnant student alleged that Acharya had told her to abort her child. It remains to be seen what action is taken against Acharya. Because hers is a contractual appointment, there is some confusion over whether she would be treated as a university employee. Sources said that, if needed, the head of the MSW department would also be questioned by the ICC.
 
 High court orders stay on probe
 
 Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Monday stayed investigation on an FIR lodged by an MSW student of Gujarat University against department’s former project coordinator for Master in Social Work course, Vaishali Acharya. The HC admitted Acharya’s quashing petition against the FIR and sought a reply from the Gujarat University police in this regard by November 15. Last week, a 4th semester student of Social Work course complained of mental harassment and trauma by Acharya. The student claimed that she was three-month pregnant and alleged that Acharya forced her to terminate her pregnancy to focus on her career. Earlier, MSW students complained, which was signed by 100 students, before the vice chancellor about Acharya’s alleged harassment.
