Noida: An encroachment drive was carried out by the Noida Authority in Sector 51 on Tuesday where unauthorised dwellings,  , parking and   were razed. This step was taken on the long pending demand of the residents welfare association (RWA) of the sector.

 “Traffic sub-inspector Bipin Raghav visited our sector along with his team and eight to nine cranes, and towed away eight Ola and Uber cabs that were parked in an unauthorised area in our sector. We had been complaining for long against these unauthorised parking by private buses, cabs, tempos etc. on the sector roads. Also, we had complained against rampant encroachment by shops, kiosks and unauthorised construction in the sector. We had earlier written a letter to SP (traffic) regarding the same,” said Sanjeev Kumar, RWA general secretary, Sector 51.
 
 Later, RWA requested officials from different departments of Authority to attend their monthly meeting to seek redress on a host of civic issues, including blocked sewers, unkempt parks, green areas, roads, water supply and drainage.
 
 However, residents were disheartened to see lack of seriousness from the Authority in taking up the sector issues.
