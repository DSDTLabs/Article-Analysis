A play, based on the film, 'ISIS — Enemies of Humanity', was staged in the city’s suburbs recently. Yuvraj Kumar who plays the lead in the film stepped into the shoes of the protagonist in the play as well. Talking about the play, 'Between the Truths', Yuvraj says, “I performed the play based on my film so that I could talk to the audience about the themes in it.” That’s not all, the World One Festival which was organised by the film’s producer, Atlantic Films, in September, was kicked off with the same play. The performance witnessed a huge turnout. Performances by popular bands like Riddim Funktion and Reggae Rajahs attempted to promote world peace. The event also saw the unveiling of paintings by Siberian artist Dunya Boshkan. 'ISIS — Enemies Of Humanity' sends out a clear message — an ideology that is violent or destructive cannot survive a positive and progressive one. The film which hits screens on September 29 attempts to end and expose the doctrines behind extremism and terrorism.
