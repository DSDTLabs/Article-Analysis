KOLKATA: A day after   — a third-year college student accused of molesting an employee of the US Consulate at   — was sent to judicial custody till Wednesday, a local court fixed May 3 as the date for a test identification (TI) parade in this case.

 
 The court had earlier granted permission to record the woman’s confidential statement in this case. Public prosecutor   informed court on Friday that they were opposing the accused’s bail as it was a “heinous crime”.
 
 The cops said that the judicial custody was necessary as no TI parade can be done until the accused is in jail custody. “The woman’s statement before the magistrate is equally important for the case. Her statement — when matched with the technical evidence, the CCTV footage and mobile tower locations — will help establish the crime and make the case stronger,” said an investigating officer.
 
 Agarwal, a student at a south Kolkata college, was arrested earlier this month. The cops have, since then, increased vigil in the Short Street area and ensured that there are no dark alleys in and around the   area.
