KOLKATA:   won the hearts of   fans with his magical skills and an ever-smiling countenance. On Monday, though, one came across a different Sony as the emotional Haitian bid goodbye for the season to undergo knee surgery.

 
 Tears rolled down his cheeks and his voice choked, forcing him to pause, as he spoke about a ‘very hard decision’. “If I keep speaking, I will cry more,” he muttered. “I have to leave right now - for my career, for my future, for the club and my family. The best thing is to go, make myself fit and come back. I promise as soon as I am fit, I will be back to play for Mohun Bagan.”
 
 Not since Jose Ramirez Barreto has any Bagan player struck such a chord with club supporters. “Seeing them wearing my mask yesterday was just amazing. You can compare Bagan with any team in the world, but not the fans,” he said. Sony, who guided Bagan to I-League and Federation Cup titles after joining them in the 2014-15, suffered the knee injury while playing against   at the Barasat Stadium in December.
