Based on the autobiographical journey of an Indian Born Australian entrepreneur, Saroo Brierly, Hollywood film   has been nominated in six categories at the 89th  , with Indian origin actor   being nominated for Best Supporting Actor. But the reason this movie has become a source of celebration for the state, is because 20 minutes of it feature cities like Indore, Ujjain, Khandwa, Burhanpur, Dewas and Khargone.  , whose birth name is Sheru Munshi Khan, was a resident of Ganesh Talai in Khandwa district. Adopted by a Tasmanian family at the age of five, Saroo took up the herculean task of tracing his roots back to Khandwa, with the help of apps and was reunited with his family after 25 years. Lion is based on his autobiographical account, called A Long Way Home. While we wait with our fingers crossed for the award ceremony, here’s all you need to know about the journey of the   in  .

 
 
 
 The cast and crew of Lion shot in MP for about 19 days. The sequences shot in Khandwa, Dewas, Ujjain and Burhanpur show the early life of Saroo when he was separated from his family, and also his reunion 25 years later. Pravesh Sahani, who was the line producer of the filming process in India, shares, “With great effort and help extended by MPT (MP Tourism), we shot in Khandwa and other regions peacefully. A local MPT officer was assigned to us. We had to house about 200 members of the cast and crew in the town of Khandwa, but the people there responded warmly. Despite being around Caucasians, the people of the villages opened up their homes for the crew. It was great working with director   and I can assure you he has fond memories of his time spent in the state.”
 
 
 
 
 Madhya Pradesh was once known for its Tigers. But now, it is making headlines across the world for the Oscar nominated movie Lion. Company Secretary at Madhya Pradesh Tourism, Sandesh Yeshlaha states, “It is a great honour for the state to be a part of a film that may just receive the most 
 coveted award in the world. It was shot across the Nimadi region of MP, and features some of its unexplored tourist destinations. After 
 receiving these nominations and being recognised on an international platform, people are more curious to explore the towns of Khandwa, Indore, Dewas and Ujjain. Ashirgarh fort from Burhanpur, where the protagonist’s lost sequence was filmed, has been receiving more acknowledgement now. It was formerly only known to locals.” Confident that more people will be interested in these places after watching the movie, Vineet Sakargayen, a young businessman who hails from Khandwa, shares, “Khandwa was so far known for the Hanuwantiya and Jal Mahotsav, but now that the movie will be releasing in India, people will look at Khandwa from a different perspective.” 
 
 
 
 
 When Saroo hit a dead end during the search for his home, a relatively unknown Facebook page called Khandwa My Home Town came to his aid. In an address at a press meet, Brierley mentions how he had left a message on the page asking about his area Ganesh Talai, without expecting any reply. But the admin surprised him by confirming the existence of the place and giving him exact details of its location. That’s how Saroo met his mother.
 
 
 
 The makers of the movie have organised an exclusive release of the movie for Saroo’s family, in Indore 
 . “Saroo Brierley (Sheru Munshi Khan) will be flying down from Calcutta 
  and his real mother Fatema Munshi Khan will be coming from Khandwa, to attend this special release. Other extended family, friends and the crew, would also be attending,” informs Pravesh Sahani, the producer. He also shares, “While we were shooting in Khandwa, we frequently met Saru’s mother and visited his home in Ganesh Talayi, though the shooting in Khandwa was majorly done on Blue Bridge, Khandwa Dam and Jheeri Village.”
