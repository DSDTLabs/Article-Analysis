VADODARA: A team of   (ACB) from Ahmedabad swooped on a Waghodia-based   and detained its founder-president   and two others, creating quite a flutter in the  .

 The ACB team seized Rs 20 lakh cash and some property documents. ACB sources said that the exact details of the seizure would be shared on Tuesday as the operation is likely to continue overnight. 
 
 However, sources confirmed that they have detained Shah and two others identified as Dhrumil and Savant. Sources in the ACB said that they laid a trap after receiving a complaint about Shah. 
 
 The source said that Shah used to demand bribe from students for admission and passing them in exams. Cheques were taken from the students and after they paid him the cash, the cheques would be returned. More skeletons are likely to tumble out of the cupboard on Tuesday with sources suggesting that the raids were just the tip of the iceberg and massive admission scam involving big pay-offs for admission and examination fraud expected to be unfolded.
