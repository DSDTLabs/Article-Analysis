TIRUNELVELI: After more than 17 months special teams of the   district police conducted a surprise raid in  , a coastal fishing village, which is known for fabricating and using country bombs to settle scores over a rivalry that exists between two groups of fishermen in that village for more than two decades.

 However no explosives were seized in the raids that lasted for about five hours. The police suspected that the villagers could have got an alert about the raid and moved the explosives to safer places. Police sources said that they would be conducting more surprise raids to keep incidents of country bomb hurling under check.
 
 According to the police, country bomb culture surfaced and is in practice in the village since rivalry erupted between the two groups around 20 years ago. During the tenure of P Kannappan as the superintendent of police of the district from 1999 to 2003 surprise raids were conducted there in unexpected intervals to keep the practice under check and restore peace.
 
 But country bombs were hurled on at a house on February 10, 2015, but nobody was injured. More than 60 country bombs were hurled during a group clash on June 9, 2015, and three persons taking part in a wedding procession were injured. As many as 159 country made bombs were seized in an intensive raid conducted on November 29, 2015.
 
 A total of 23 country bombs were seized in a raid on December 10, 2015, while 112 bombs were seized in a subsequent rain on September 27, 2016. Since then the first raid for country bombs was conducted in the village after more than 17 months on Tuesday.
 
  Police sources said that the local police and intelligence units are constantly monitoring the country bomb culture and movement of raw materials that are required to make the bombs from and to the village. They added that such raids will continue.
