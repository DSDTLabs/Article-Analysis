ARA: Ara-headquartered Veer Kunwar Singh University ( ) has submitted its self- study report (SSR) to the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) as part of the process to apply for its accreditation.

 VKSU’s NAAC coordinator Dr K K. Singh said on Monday the university uploaded the SSR on Sunday ahead of the NAAC team’s likely visit to the varsity by June. The NAAC team will also visit the varsity’s new campus coming up at Zero Mile at Ara.
 
 VC Syed Mumtazuddin claimed the university administration has initiated several quality enhancement measures to secure a good grade from NAAC. For instance, semester system has been implemented in all the PG departments and centralized online admission policy is being followed. An e-library is being set up and choice-based credit system will be implemented from the next academic session beginning in July.
 
 The university recently conducted the senate as well as students’ union elections, the VC said and added he was hopeful of the university getting ‘B+’ or at least ‘B’ from NAAC.
 
 The VC also talked about land scarcity. “The university is currently spread over 9-10 acres, whereas many universities have 100 acres of land. Though VKSU has got 40 acres of land for its new campus, only an examination hall and a BEd building have been constructed till date,” he said and added the state government sanctioned Rs 23 crore for the construction of an administrative building of which Rs 2.17 crore had already been released to the Bihar State Education Infrastructure Development Corporation for the purpose.
