GHAZIABAD: The   (PVVNL) had launched a ‘Tagada’ scheme in December last year to increase the monthly revenue collection from power bills. Since then, 8% more consumers have deposited their power bills, thus increasing the revenue of the department. 

 Officials said, on an average 75% of urban customers pay their   on time and the scheme has been started to increase this percentage.
 
 Under the scheme, staff from each substation call up customers who have extended the deadline of depositing their bill and remind them the same.
 
 A K Chaudhary, chief engineer, PVVNL, Ghaziabad zone, said, “Earlier, we used to alert the customers through an SMS regarding the due date. Now, our line men and operators are calling the customers and asking them to pay the bill. This is a unique initiative launched in Ghaziabad zone that comprises of Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr and Hapur districts.
 
 “This way customers, who have forgotten to pay the bill, get a reminder. Presently, the focus is only on urban consumers. Later, it will extend to rural areas ,” said Chaudhary. The senior official informed that calls are generally made between 8am-8pm, but consumers who do not pay the bill despite reminders receive calls during odd hours. “To such customers, calls are made after 11pm or around 6am.Within a month’s time around 8 percent more consumers have paid their bill,” said Chaudhary.
