JALANDHAR: Punjab   Association (PPEA) has said if power meters were shifted out of the premises of the consumers in the remaining areas, as had already been done in major parts of the state, the tariff could be reduced further. The association has also argued that state should acquire a thermal plant of supercritical technology to ensure that its Pachhwara mine could be utilized and fixed charges of Rs 2,000 crore, paid to private players, could be saved annually.

 On Tuesday, a zonal meeting of PPEA here was attended by around 100 engineers from Jalanndhar, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Kapurthala circles. Addressing a press conference after the meeting, PPEA president   said the aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C)   in Punjab were one of the lowest in the country at 14%. He said losses of neighbouring states were in the range of 30%. Punjabâ€™s losses could be brought down further if remaining meters in high-theft areas were also shifted out, he said, adding that   (PSPCL) was able to supply uninterrupted 24 hours power supply in the rural areas too.
 
 PPEA secretary Abhiraj Singh and another office-bearer Anil K Vij said strong government support and political will were required for the purpose and the AT&C losses could be brought down to around 10%. They said Punjab should acquire a thermal plant of supercritical technology without any delay to ensure that cheap and good quality coal was utilized from Pachhwara mine. So far, the mining rights were not being used and there were chance that the Centre could cancel the mine allocation, they said. Punjab could save fixed charges of around Rs 2,000 crores being paid to private thermal plants as fixed charges and this would ultimately benefit the consumers, the association said.
 
 The association members also suggested that the state government should adapt UDAY scheme of the Union government without any delay for financial turnaround of PSPCL. The corporation had already met the set parameters, it added.
