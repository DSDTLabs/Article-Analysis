VISAKHAPATNAM: In a bid to attract tourists, the state government has introduced sound system to explain the history of   in three languages — English, Telugu and Hindi. While the system in English was introduced on February 24, the Telugu and Hindi versions are to be introduced in April.

 Till now, the history of Borra Caves was being explained to tourists by guides belonging to tribal communities. But it is difficult for foreigners and non-locals to understand Telugu. This led to the thought of introducing the system in the other two languages. Borra Caves, located near  , is one of the largest caves in the country situated at an elevation of about 2,313 feet above mean sea level. 
 
 The caves are basically karstic limestone structures extending to a depth of 80 meters and is also considered to be the deepest cave in India.
 
 AP   (APTDC) had installed   lighting system in the caves recently. “The new sound system in English has been attracting a lot of tourists. If we can introduce Telugu and Hindi too before the summer vacations, we can attract more number of tourists,” an APTDC official said. 
 
 The history of Borra Caves has been divided into three parts. 
 
 Once the tourists enter the premises, there will be details about the caves and the sanitation around it followed by the history of the caves’ formation and the tribal groups residing in the area. Near the middle of the caves, the tourists will get to know the shapes of the caves and the measures taken up to protect them.
