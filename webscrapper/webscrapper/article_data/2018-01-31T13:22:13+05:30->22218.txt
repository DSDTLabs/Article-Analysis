PANAJI: Chief minister Manohar   on Tuesday said all financial transactions of the state government will be in digital mode from October 1.

 Speaking at the state credit seminar 2018-19 organised by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) at a function in Panaji, the chief minister said his government is going full scale into digital payments.
 
 “By September 30 my government will go cashless,” Parrikar said. In November 2016, post DeMon, Parrikar had announced that Goa would be the first state in the country to go   and would achieve this by December 31, 2016.
 
 “Less cash means less corruption and less evil, which leads to increase in state income and decrease in taxation,” Parrikar said on Tuesday.
 
 Parrikar said that an increase in farmers’ income will lead to a substantial increase in the country’s economy. “The goal is to increase farmers’ income by 2022,” he said adding that this should be done in “real terms and not figuratively”.
 
 The chief minister said, “My endeavour has been to push agricultural growth in Goa to over 6%. From an earlier negative growth of 4%, my government brought it to 6% when we took over and we are now trying to push it beyond that.”
 
 He also spoke of considering taking support from banking institutions to achieve the Open Defecation Free status.
 
 Parrikar also launched micro ATMs of Goa State Cooperative Bank. Nabard has provided grant support for RuPay KCC cards and installing of 100 micro ATMs in various branches, primary agricultural cooperative societies and merchant establishments to bring technological upgradations in operations of cooperative banks.
