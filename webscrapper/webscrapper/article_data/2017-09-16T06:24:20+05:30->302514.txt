PATNA: Bihar government has rejected RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son and leader of opposition in the assembly, Tejashwi Prasad’s request to let him retain his official bungalow. 

 State building construction department (BCD) minister Maheshwar Hazari said, “The 5, Deshratna Marg bungalow has been earmarked as the official bungalow for the deputy CM and the one at 1, Polo Road has been for leader of opposition in legislative assembly. The bungalows have been allotted to Tejashwi and   (SuMo) accordingly.” 
 
 Tejashwi had written to Hazari and the CM’s secretariat on August 31 to allow him to stay in his current bungalow, citing Sushil Modi’s example, who retained his official bungalow in 2013 after CM Nitish Kumar ended his 17-year-old alliance with the BJP. 
 
 With the state government refusing to oblige him, sources said he has decided to live with his parents at 10, Circular Road bungalow, which was allotted to his mother and former CM Rabri Devi in 2005.
