AHMEDABAD: The Fee Regulatory Committee ( ) on Sunday announced the fees for 186 private schools across the state. The committee has put the fee details on the education departmentâ€™s portal. Shockingly, the government and the fee committee have approved the fees demanded by most schools. This suggests that the excessive fees which were being charged by various school authorities have been cleared by the fee committee.
 
 The fee committee decision undermines the mission of the   Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017, which was introduced to rein in school managements who charged exorbitant fees. According to the fee structure stipulated by the Act, the annual fee band was Rs 15,000 for the primary section, Rs 25,000 for the secondary section, and Rs 27,000 for the higher secondary section.
 
 According to the fees announced by the FRC, Gandhinagar International School has been permitted to charge annual fees of Rs 1.29 lakh against its proposal of Rs 1.85 lakh. The FRC has allowed nearly 12 schools to charge fees that breach the caps. Some schools have been given the nod to take provisional fees of Rs 60,000.
 
  In Ahmedabad zone, at least seven schools have been permitted to charge annual fees of more than Rs 60,000.
