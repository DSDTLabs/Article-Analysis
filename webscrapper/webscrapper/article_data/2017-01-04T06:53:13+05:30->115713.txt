NEW DELHI: The management of   Ltd's   mines in Jharkhand ignored tell-tale signs ahead of the December 29 cave-in of an open cast mine that has claimed 18 lives so far, according to the head of Directorate General of Mines Safety.

 “There is no doubt that there was laxity on the part of the mine management. There were sufficient visible indications to suggest movement in the pile of earth and an impending slide,“ director-general of DGMS Rahul Guha told TOI on Tuesday .
 
 A mountain of earth, formed by the 'overburden' dug out to expose layers of coal in an open cast mine, caved in on Thursday last week and buried 23 workers. So far, 18 bodies have been recovered. This is one of the country's worst mine disasters in recent times in terms of casualties and “unprecedented“ in terms of the size of the slide.
 
 “I am not talking about complex technical mechanism. It is a question of dumpslide monitoring. You can see the cracks developing. Then you see them getting wider.This obviously means the pile is moving and can cave in. Under such circumstance, you remove workers and equipment and keep it out of bounds. This was not done in Lalmatia mines,“ Guha said.
 
 DGMS conducts “sample checks“ at mines periodically to ensure whether prescribed procedures are being followed for workers' safety. “But any number of sample checks or statutory bodies cannot prevent disasters unless the mine managements remain alive to the issue,“ he added. 
 
 The DGMS is probing the Lalmatia accident, recent in a series involving coal mines. Separately, Coal India has also ordered a comprehensive review of safety at subsidiaries, including Eastern Coalfields.
