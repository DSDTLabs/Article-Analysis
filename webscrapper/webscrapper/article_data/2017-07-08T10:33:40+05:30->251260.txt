LONDON: Lying on the grass on a summer's day took on a new meaning at Wimbledon. Bethanie   was on her back, screaming in pain, midway through her second-round singles match. The women's 12th seed Kristina   also went slip-sliding on a blistering hot day. The Frenchwoman, took her loss, however, saying she was happy to be healthy! "It's totally different than the previous years," the 24-year-old Mladenovic said of the grass. "I guess the climate doesn't help, too hot, too sunny, makes everything dry. That's what we got as an answer from the officials. It also makes it super slow. There's no more grass on Court 18. I'm just very blessed and happy I'm not injured right now, because we saw worse."

 Mattek-Sands came down in a heap on Court 17 just past the two-hour mark of her clash against Romania's  . The 32-year-old, who is in hospital and undergoing scans, could be out of the game for up to six months should she go under the knife.
 
 Cirstea, 27, who had just levelled set scores, rushed over to her opponent almost as soon as she came down. The Bucharest-born pro said: "We all know grass, it's quite dangerous sometimes. As you move forward in the tournament it's less grass and more sand or whatever. I also had two quite tough balls where I almost fell over. What happened today was unfortunate. Could've happened to anyone."
 
 Mladenovic, who along with opponent American Alison Riske complained about the condition of the courts at the start of the match, said: "I would like to be disappointed about my loss, but I'm actually feeling happy that I didn't injure myself much because I really felt bad with my knee when I fell down."
 
 Mladenovic, who said she was echoing locker-room sentiments, found some support from seven-time Wimbledon champion  .
