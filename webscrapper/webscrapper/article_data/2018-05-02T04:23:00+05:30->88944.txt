Vadodara: Even as Vadodara rural police have not been able to find the four-year-old girl, who was kidnapped from Sevasi by a construction labourer on April 19, sources in rural police have revealed that cops had failed to act on the application of complaint they received a day after the incident. The case of kidnapping was registered on Sunday only after the girl’s family members created ruckus at the at Vadodara taluka police station on Saturday evening. Sources in the police station said that the girl’s maternal grandmother had come to the police station a day after the accused Raju abducted the girl from outside her house. The woman had given an application to register the complaint but an assistant sub-inspector of Vadodara taluka who was handed over the investigation of the complaint did not act and the case was not registered. But when the family members expressed anger at the police station on April 28, police realized the seriousness of the incident and registered an FIR on April 29 morning. However, in the FIR the police mentioned that since the girl’s family members were searching for her on their own, the complaint was registered late. “When the incident came to the notice of PSI of Vadodara taluka police station, he immediately registered an offence. In fact, on the same day we formed a special investigating team headed by circle police inspector of Karjan to find the girl. The team includes officials of local crime branch, special operations group and local police,” said Saurabh Tolumbiya, superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural).  He also said the police have found some clues and the girl will be found soon. The accused Raju, who happens to be the girl’s maternal grandfather’s friend, had abducted the girl when she was playing outside her house. Raju and the girl’s grandfather had slept in the house on April 19 afternoon after consuming liquor. Raju woke up early and found the girl’s grandfather asleep, he took her away.
