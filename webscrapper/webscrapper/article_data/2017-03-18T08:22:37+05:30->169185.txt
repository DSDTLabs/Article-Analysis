NEW DELHI: An 18-year-old woman was mowed down by a chartered bus at   on Friday morning. The bus driver, Harilal, has been arrested.

 The victim, Kajal Mandal, was heading to her computer coaching classes on her scooty when the accident happened. Harilal, who was carrying employees of the CGO complex, lost control and hit Mandal who lost balance and came under the front left wheels of the bus.
 
 Harilal said that due to the slope he could not apply the brakes on time. He said that he tried to overtake the scooty and take the middle lane when Mandal’s scooter skid and came under the wheels.
 
 Mandal suffered severe injuries despite wearing a helmet. Local residents said that Harilal, along with some of the passengers and passersby, rushed her to the Moolchand hospital across the road where she was declared dead on arrival.
 
 Mandal’s family, who live in Sadiq Nagar, and the police were informed by the hospital authorities. Mandal’s family members said that it was unlikely that she could have skidded without a reason. “She has been riding a scooter for the past few years now. Lately, she got a licence and drove to college and her computer classes daily. How could she have skidded without a reason?” said Vishal Mandal, Kajal’s cousin.
 
 Mandal’s father, Sunil, has a contractual job at the Japanese Embassy while her mother, Poonam, is a clerk at the ministry of defence. “She wanted to pursue civil services or take up a government job. All of it is now shattered,” the family said.
 
 The body was taken to   for an autopsy and later handed over to the family. 
 
 Police said that Harilal was booked under sections of causing death due to negligence (304A) and dangerous driving (279 IPC)
