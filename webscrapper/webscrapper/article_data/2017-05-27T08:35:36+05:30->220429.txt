NEW DELHI: As India prepare to defend their   title in England from June 4, we look at some of the stats highlights for the country at the tournament since its inception in 1998. India have made the final thrice - winning in 2013, losing in 2000 and being declared joint winners with Sri Lanka in 2002.
