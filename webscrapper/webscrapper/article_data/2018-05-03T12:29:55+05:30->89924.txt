AMRITSAR: Harinder Singh Sikka, producer of controversial movie ‘Nanak Shah Fakir’, has questioned the mandate of   (DMC) for serving him a notice, ignoring the court orders and the   — which changed its stand after pressure from various Sikh bodies. Sikka has sought investigation by the DMC chairman into circumstances leading to the issuance of a notice to him.

 “The DMC notice borders on contempt of the highest court of India. It appears that DMC intentionally ignored the two orders issued by the three-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India in April and the approvals given by Akal Takht and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee,” he wrote in a letter, a copy of which is with TOI, sent to chairman DMC Zafarul Islam Khan.
 
 On April 12, DMC had served a notice on Sikka on the complaint of Jagminder Singh, member, Sikh advisory committee, alleging hurting of religious sentiments of Sikh community by ‘Nanak Shah Fakir’. The notice was issued by DMC member  .
 
 While admitting that he had written a letter to the DMC chairman, Sikka told TOI on Wednesday that a notice to him could be part of a conspiracy. “The DMC should not issue such notices without due deliberations for it reeks of bias and partisan approach,” he alleged, adding that the movie was being screened only after the court’s orders.
 
 Besides, he said both Akal Takht and SGPC had given its approval for the screening of the movie. He said he had urged chairman to hold investigations into the circumstances which led to the issuance of notice which had caused him much harassment.
