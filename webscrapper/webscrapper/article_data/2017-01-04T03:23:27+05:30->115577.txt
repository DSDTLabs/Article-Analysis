NOIDA: The   (NMRC) has initiated a study for seamless transfer from other modes of transport to the Metro stations along the 29.7-km Metro corridor between   and  . An MoU was inked between NMRC and   (IUT) — an agency under the purview of the Union ministry of urban development — for this purpose last month. A meeting to take the project forward was held on Tuesday.

 According to officials, the study will be conducted on accessibility and multimodal integration options for commuters or riders to commute to and from all the 21 Metro stations along the route. Based on the results of the study, the most suitable mode of transport will be provided at each Metro station.
 
 Modes of transport such as buses, autorickshaws, cycles, private car, pedestrian options and walkways will be assessed to ensure how a person can reach a particular Metro station and their destination from there, officials said. NMRC officials told TOI that the focus was on enhancing passenger volume with effective integration and the accessibility plan.
 
 “IUT will look at flow patterns and how people who walk, or use an autorickshaw, private vehicle or a bus would access the station. The plan is to physically integrate Metro stations with bus shelters, auto stands, cycle stands and parking lots in the vicinity through skywalks or ramps,” P D Upadhyay, general manager (Finance), NMRC, said.
 
 “The idea is to provide the Metro commuter first- and last-mile connectivity from both sides of the Metro stations,” he added.
 
 Officials said that traffic simulation would be used to get real-time information and to prepare detailed conceptual design. “The study will commence from the Sector 50 Metro station along the route. The focus stations will include high-density stations of Sector 71 in Noida and   in Greater Noida. The study will be completed much before the track is completed,” he said.
