HYDERABAD: Five months ago, the Rachakonda police had drawn an elaborate plan to develop the temple town of   into  , but the   to remain paper. 

 While announcing the plan for the temple town, in December, Rachakonda police commissioner   had said that the temple town would be plush with police personnel. However, owing to the tardy pace of file movement in the corridors of powers, the security plans are yet to see the light of day. As per its plan, the temple town was meant to have new police stations for crime, traffic and women. Also, it was supposed to have a three-layer security arrangement for the temple premises, which included an outer cordon and an inner cordon, around the temple premises. 
 
 When contacted, the police chief told TOI, that the state government is yet to release the budgetary allocations, for it to take up these works, "The new police stations are still pending, as staff for these stations is yet to be drafted into the rolls," he said. Police had mulled plans of having special surveillance units and machinery, to protect the area which has been witnessing heavy VIP movement. 
 
 "We were planning on having special under-vehicle surveillance units at all the entry points of the temple hillock, as a part of an anti-sabotage protocol, but we need considerable budgetary allocation for that. The file is still pending with the government," he added. 
 
 That's not all the police chief had also announced the formulation of a VIP housing facility, which entailed a five-star level complex, complete with bullet-proof windows and security checks among others. But senior officials from the department said that this plan was currently with the   temple development authority.
