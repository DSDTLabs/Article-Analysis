MUMBAI: The   on Monday directed the anti-corruption bureau ( ) to complete its open inquiry into the alleged   tender scam within three months. A division bench of Justices Ranjit More and Anuja Prabhudessai also restrained the state from paying the toll operator Rs 390 crore due as viability gap fund without its permission. 

 The HC was hearing a criminal PIL by activist Pravin Wategaonkar, who had sought a probe into the alleged corrupt practices in the tendering process. He claimed the IVRCL-Kakade Infrastructure (KIPL) joint venture—Sion-Panvel Tollways Ltd—had bagged the contract by offering the lowest viability gap fund of Rs 390 crore. KIPL is owned by BJP MP Sanjay Kakade. Wategonkar alleged that four eligible bidders were denied tender forms and a firm with no experience in such projects was awarded the bid.
 
 At the last hearing, the court had questioned the state over the delay in filing an FIR. 
 
 Additional public prosecutor Sultana Sonawane said the Prevention of Corruption Act provided for an open inquiry. The prosecutor submitted an ACB report and said the agency wanted to probe the tendering process. The ACB sought six months’ time to complete the open inquiry to decide wh-ether an FIR was warranted, but the HC directed it to wrap up the probe in three months.
 
 Last September, the ACB said it had conducted a discreet inquiry and sought permission for an open inquiry. Wate-goankar alleged that since people close to the ruling party were involved, the state seems to be delaying the matter. He claimed the state was planning to pay the Rs 390-crore VGF to the firm by March 31, 2017. When the prosecutor said there was no such plan yet, the HC said the state would have to take its approval before deciding to make the payment.
