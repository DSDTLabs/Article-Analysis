NAGPUR: Chief Minister   had a new look donning a suit and overcoat as he landed in snow-clad   on Tuesday. But, more significantly, his effective promotion of the proposed Nagpur-Mumbai Maha   Super Highway and seeking investors’ attention at the   (WEF) was the highlight of the Swiss visit.

 Fadnavis attended a meeting themed ‘Industrial corridors in India — Demand-led planning & financing’, organized by the   (CII) on Tuesday morning.
 
 Presenting the plan for the super highway, Fadnavis said it will benefit the entire state, especially farmers as this prosperity corridor will have agricultural nodes for 24 districts for supply chain, cold storage with focus on agriculture processing. 
 
 “The end-to-end well-planned corridor will be the largest in India. Port connectivity with Mumbai’s JNPT will be leveraged too,” he said at the meet.
 
 Work for this Rs34,000 crore project is to start in March 2018 this year and will be completed in three years, the CM added. He was confident that 85%of the land required for the super-highway would be acquired through direct purchase from farmers by next month.
 
 NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, who was also present at the meeting, appreciated Maharashtra’s model of getting land through consensus-based negotiations from land holders and for getting best participation in projects avoiding litigations. 
 
 At Davos, Fadnavis also announced various other investment opportunities in Mumbai especially related to Metro network. He also announced that WEF is opening office in Mumbai.
