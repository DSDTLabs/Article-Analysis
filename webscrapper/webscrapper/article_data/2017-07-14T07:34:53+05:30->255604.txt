Shreya had completed BCA from MGM College and recently joined MIT. The family had borrowed Rs 1.75 lakh for her education. Though the reason behind the suicide pact wasn't known, sources claimed Shankar was facing difficulty in getting dues from customers, and he had complained to the president of  ,  , in this regard.
 
 Shankar's brother Damodhar said they learnt about the suicide when one of his daughters called out for Shankar. When none responded, she looked through the window to find the house latched from inside. "Immediately, we opened the door and rushed all four of them to hospital where they were declared brought dead," he added. Kaup MLA Vinaykumar Sorake said Acharya's wife was reportedly seen washing vessels in the morning. After that, there was a sudden silence, and that was when his extended family members got worried. “In the kitchen, the food was found laced with poison,“ he added.
 
 Alevoor Yogesh Acharya, who heads the Udupi chapter of Vishwakarma Okkutta, said Acharya was very adept at work. "Jewellers have been facing financial pressure for 6-7 years. Financial crisis is one of the possible reasons for this tragedy," he added.
