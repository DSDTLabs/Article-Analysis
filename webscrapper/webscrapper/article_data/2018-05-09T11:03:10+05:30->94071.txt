PANAJI: Representatives from various villages under the banner of ‘Goemkars against PDAs’ will begin a five-day chain hunger strike at Azad Maidan, Panaji, on Wednesday to continue to press for their demands of scrapping all PDAs, scrapping Regional Plan 2021 and amending the Town and Country Planning Act to include the 73rd and 74th amendments.

 Roshan  , a member of Goemkars against  , said the hunger strike is being organised to intensify their demands ahead of the   board meeting scheduled on May 16.
 
 “We expected the TCP minister to hold a TCP board meeting last month and discuss our issues, but it wasn’t held,” Mathias said.
 
  told reporters that the issue is unnecessarily being dragged on. “It’s not just about denotifying all the PDAs, but also about bringing in the 73rd and 74th amendments. We don’t want to come out on the streets again, but we’re frustrated,” he said. As far as Regional Plan 2021 is concerned,   says it either needs to be rectified or scrapped entirely as it has been “prepared without data”.
