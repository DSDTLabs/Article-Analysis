NEW DELHI:   member   said "injustice to Muslims" was making terror outfits like the so-called IS attractive in the country, soon after an inter-state terror operation resulted in the killing of two terrorists, suspected to have been influenced by the global jihadi outfit. 

  He said, "Continuous persecution and injustice to Muslims will make Pakistan's wish to create unrest in India attractive. They have to be given a sense of belonging and confidence that everyone is equal." 
 
 He went on to add, "Even though   was in our neighbourhood, not a single Muslim was found associated with Taliban." He pinned the blame for the surfacing of IS in the country to the BJP government at the Centre.
 
 The remark appeared to credit Congress and UPA's "secular policies" for Taliban failing to dig roots in India despite being close in neighbouring Afghanistan.
 
 Congress appeared uneasy with Singh's decision to cast the growth of IS in terms of minority persecution but refused to comment.
 
 H owever, the party blamed BJP for failing to tackle terror and bringing IS to India. Spokesman   said, "The attack in MP by an IS module as claimed by the MP government reflects deterioration of government vigil on national security issues and failure of intelligence agencies . 
 
 Digvijaya also poked fun at BJP for "striking an alliance with ISI", arguing that four of the 11 "non-Muslim" ISI spies caught in MP belonged to the saffron party.
