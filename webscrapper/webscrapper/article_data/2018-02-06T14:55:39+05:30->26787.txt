NEW DELHI: Every three in four girls from the   community in India are subjected to genital mutilation a study has found.

 
  In order to capture the horror of the procedure, it highlights the case of an 8-year-old girl who was rushed to a hospital by her parents after they realised that excessive bleeding from a botched circumcision had put her life in danger. Resident of a prominent city, this girl had to be stitched up in a hospital 12 hours after the ‘khatna’ procedure by a traditional circumciser who told the mother of child that in her “experience of 35 years this was the first case that had got spoilt”.
 
 A survivor of Female Genital Mutilation ( ), the little girl’s traumatic experience last May finds space in a study titled ‘The Clitoral Hood a Contested Site: Khafd or Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) in India’. Brought out by a network of survivors ‘We Speak Out’ and  , the study is based on interviews with 94 people(83 women and 11 men). As many as 81 women in the survey had been subjected to ‘Khafd.’ The age of those surveyed was between 17 and 85.
 
 The study states that 75% of daughters (aged 7 and above) of all respondents in the study were subjected to FGM/C. Nearly 33% of women subjected to Khafd in the study believe FGM/C has negatively impacted their sexual life. The writers of the report demanded an anti-FGM/C legislation primarily targeting providers of Khafd, warning that India runs the risk of becoming a hub for FGM/C of expat and foreign Bohra girls.
 
 Reacting to the report, a member of the community said, “We practise a harmless cultural and religious practise called khafz. Khafzis not FGM. Few with vested interests have misguided everyone against the community that is really sad.”
