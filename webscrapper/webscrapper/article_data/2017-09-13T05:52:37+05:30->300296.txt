AHMEDABAD: Of the 10 taluka panchayat seats where byelections were held, the BJP won seven while the   could win only three. However, though the BJP claims that they had snatched three seats from the Congress, the opposition party claimed that the BJP already had six of the seats for which by-elections were held.

 State BJP office-bearers claimed in a statement that out of the 10 seats in 8 nagarpalikas (located in seven districts), the Congress had six seats. The BJP claimed that the party had snatched three of these seats from the Congress. The Congress lost in Bhuj where a BJP minority candidate was elected.
 
 Similarly, the two seats the BJP won was that of Navagadh in Jetpur and one seat in Bagasara. The BJP candidates retained their seats in Anand, Visavadar and Wakaner. 
 
 State BJP president Jitu Vaghani said that the Congress losses once again showed that the party had again been rejected by the voters. The BJP has won three seats which were earlier with the Congress, Vaghani said.
 
 Meanwhile, state Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi claimed that the party has lost just one seat to the BJP. 
 
 He said the Congress had only four seats for which by-elections were held. Of these, the party had retained three, Doshi said. 
 
 He further said that in BJP MP Vitthal Radhadia’s stronghold, the Saffron Party’s candidate had lost even his deposit. 
 
 The Patidar affect was working against the BJP and, hence, the party lost the   seat to Congress. "The BJP candidate could not even save his deposit," Doshi said.
