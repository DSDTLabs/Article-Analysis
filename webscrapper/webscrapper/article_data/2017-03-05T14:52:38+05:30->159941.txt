VARANASI: Shahid Jamal was among several Muslims who had lined up to watch PM Modi when his roadshow passed through Madanpura locality on Saturday. Many elderly people of the locality said they had gathered to show respect to Modi as the PM. However, the common refrain of many of them was: "It doesn't mean we are going to vote for him. We will never vote for him." 

 " Agar hum inko vote kar bhi dein tobhi na to BJP wale na Modiji vishwas karenge ki humne inko vote diya (Even we vote for them, neither BJP nor Modi will believe that we have given our votes to them)," said Shahid, while watching PM's roadshow pass through Madanpura.M adanpura was known as highly communally sensitive for more than a decade after the riots took place in the city between 1991 and 1993. Like Hindu dominated and mixed populated localities on the route, equal enthusiasm was evident among Muslims of Madanpura, Shivala and Kashmiri Ganj areas to see him. 
 
 While elders were sceptical, youngsters like Mohammad Jubair were impressed with the manner in which PM passed through the area in an open SUV. " Ye to kamal ho gaya, humne to pehli baar Pradhan Mantri ko is terah se logon ke hujoom mein jate dekha hai (For the first time I have seen a PM moving amidst a huge crowd).
