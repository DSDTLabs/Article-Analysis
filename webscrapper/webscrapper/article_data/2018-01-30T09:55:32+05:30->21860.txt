INDORE: A   of the encroachment around   has revealed that even it has been declared as a  ,   granted permission for   of 16   within a 300 metre radius of the fort and over 500 others were built without permission. 

 The report was submitted before the Indore bench of high court in the petition seeking removal of these illegal constructions on Monday. While the contention of the petitioner is only for removal of the buildings constructed after March 10, 1999 (when the fort was given heritage status), the data collected in the survey has revealed anomalies in legality of the structures built close to the fort much before the notification.
 
 Before 1999, of the 1035 buildings, which were constructed within the 300 metre radius of the fort, only six were found to have taken permission for construction from the municipal council. 
 
 On the other hand, after the notification, which banned any construction around the fort, 521 buildings were constructed in the restricted area. Among them, the civic body granted permission to 16 buildings, despite the fort having been declared as a heritage site. 
 
 These 521 constructions were built in four private colonies around the district which includes Shanti Kunj, Shreeji Vihar, Shreeji Dham and Happy Villa. Also, 80 pattas, eight freehold lease holders and 16 lease holders were found to have possession of the land within 300 metre radius of the fort. 
 
 The other structures which were recorded to have been constructed in the prohibited area were 20 temples, three petrol pumps, one cinema hall, 11 schools, three government buildings, four government offices, a private hospital, a club, press club, church and a knowledge centre. 
 
 The total number of constructions found within the 300 metre radius was 1556. Of them, permission has been granted legally only to six constructions that too before 1999.
