Amritsar: The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has decided to honour Muslim chief Rai Kalha, having roots in Hinduism, by installing his photograph along with Guru Gobind Singh’s relic Ganga Sagar, presently in custody of Kalha’s ninth generation descendent Rai Azizullah Khan who has kept the sacred relic with respect.

 The Golden Temple manager Sulakhan Singh had, on July 18, extended invitation to Rai Aziz Ullah Khan to attend the installation ceremony of photograph of Rai Kalha along with Ganga Sagar in Kendri Sikh Ajayab Ghar (Central Sikh Museum) on July 24. The letter was sent at Lahore address of Aziz.
 
 “It was such a short notice, even the visa formalities would have taken over a week’s time. I will miss the ceremony and lose an opportunity to witness my ancestor being honoured by the Sikhs’ single largest representative body in the world,” Aziz told TOI on Thursday from Vancouver, Canada.
 
 He said he felt very proud of his elders who had helped Guru Gobind Singh risking their own and other family members life. “I am indebted to every one for so much love and affection towards Rai family,” he said.
