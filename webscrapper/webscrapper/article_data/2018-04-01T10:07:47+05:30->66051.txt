PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Starting today, the   ( ) will not collect wet garbage from the big housing societies that were told to opt composting before April 1. However, most of these societies are not equipped with composting facilities yet.

 Some residents are planning an agitation and have decided to dump the garbage in the open if the civic body does not collect it.
 
 As per health department directives, the zonal offices had sent letters to all the major housing societies (generating over 100kg garbage daily) to start wet waste segregation and processing in their premises by April 1.
 
 KC Garg of Pimpri Chinchwad Co-op Housing Societies Federation told TOI, “Our federation comprises member societies from Wakad, Pimple Nilakh, Pimple Gurav, Punawale and other areas of the city. Most of them don’t have facilities to convert wet garbage into compost. Each society will have to shell out around Rs8 to 10 lakh to install such facilities. Moreover, this move was sudden. They should have conducted awareness drives to motivate residents.”
 
 He added, “We support the civic body in its efforts. But it was found that PCMC mixed the segregated garbage after collection. As a result, people stopped this practice. If PCMC does not collect wet garbage from the societies, the residents will have no choice but to throw it in the open.”
 
 Malhari Madane, executive president, Chikhli Moshi housing federation said, “The waste is collected after three days from the societies leading to foul smell and health risks. Our society did not get any letter from the PCMC. The civic body must conduct awareness drives about its initiatives and give societies the time to equip for the change. Also, many societies lack open space for setting up such measures.”
 
 Manoj Lonkar, chief of health department, PCMC, told TOI, “We will collect wet and dry garbage for some days to give more time to the societies to opt for the new measures. Soon, we will strictly take only dry waste.”
