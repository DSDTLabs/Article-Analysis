NEW DELHI : Foreign affairs minister   told the   on Wednesday that a conference India was hosting with Asean nations would focus on the need to deradicalise youth being drawn to extremism.

 She also said around 50 radicalised Indian youth have crossed over to the “other side” but added Indian ethos and culture that stressed on the role of family has contained the effects of radicalisation.
 
 The issue of radicalisation is not limited to Jammu and Kashmir but other states as well and the entire world too, she said during question hour.
 
 Responding to MIM leader Asaduddin Owaissi’s suggestion that clerics should be involved in the effort as they might have more standing than political leaders, she said the view will be considered.
 
 She said the Centre has already launched an anti-radicalisation programme with states to ensure that the youths are not misled and pointed out this was a point in discussions between PM   and Malaysian PM Najib Razak recently.
 
 Besides de-radicalisation, cross-border terrorism would be the other topic of the conference. Responding to a question, Swaraj said   was not the subject of the proposed Asean event
