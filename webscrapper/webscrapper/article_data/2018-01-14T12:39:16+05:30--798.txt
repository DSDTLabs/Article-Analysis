TIRUPATI: In what could be seen as a challenge to  , chief minister   said that his government is working seriously to set up four Cyberabads in   to leverage the talent pool. Cyberabad is a district adjacent to Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, that has emerged as a major IT hub in southern India, and is home to software companies like  , Oracle,   and Facebook.

 Naidu, who is credited with building Cyberabad, on Saturday said Fintech Valley in Visakhapatnam is gaining traction in the financial technology industry with several companies in the process of setting up their units there. Similarly, he said, the government is promoting Tirupati, Amaravati, the capital city of Andhra Pradesh, and Anantapur as IT hubs.
 
 "The government is keen to make these cities hubs of knowledge economy. We can do it because we managed to change the image of Hyderabad as a laidback city into one where the world's largest IT companies have major operations," Naidu said, after inaugurating the Tirupati facility of Zoho, an IT products developer. He said Hyderabad has become robust and happening city after he built Cyberabad. "Similarly, the four Cyberabads will change the face of Andhra Pradesh and capital Amaravati," he thundered. 
 
 Nara Lokesh, minister for information technology and communications and rural development, said the government has come up with a designated technology park (DTP) policy to encourage IT companies to set up development centres in Visakhapatnam, Amaravati, Tirupati and Anantapur on a plug-and-play basis. He said the government is expecting to generate two lakh IT jobs by 2019.
