LUCKNOW: Taking strong exception to   Narendra Modi’s veiled attack on BSP as a party only bothered about saving money, its chief   on Monday said the PM should instead disclose where and how his party got money “adjusted” before demonetisation came into play.

 Sharpening her attack on the PM, Mayawati said that BJP national president Amit Shah was not able to convince the people that Modi was a “UP wallah“ and that Modi’s rally was a “flop show”. 
 
 The BSP chief said that Modi’s speech was unable to evoke any response among the people and the crowd which BJP leaders talked about comprised security staff and some “hired” people.
 
 The BSP boss also criticised rise in prices of LPG, petrol and diesel at a time when people were grappling with the aftermath of demonetisation. She said even after 50 days, no relief was in sight.
