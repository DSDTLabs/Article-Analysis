PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party ( ) chief and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Saturday echoed the tone of his son Chirag Paswan, saying NDA, which suffered a setback in Bihar and UP byelections, should follow its ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ slogan in letter and spirit.

 “NDA needs to take along all sections of the society. Congress also ruled the country for several decades by building an inclusive society,” Paswan told reporters at Patna airport.
 
 He said the defeat of the saffron party in Phulpur and Gorakphur Lok Sabha byelections in UP was a cause for concern. He, however, attributed BJP’s loss in Araria parliamentary constituency in Bihar to sympathy for RJD’s Taslimuddin, whose death necessitated the bypoll.
 
 Asked about TDP’s exit from NDA, Paswan said had the Centre accepted Andhra Pradesh’s demand for special category status, the agitation would have spread to Bihar. “Everyone is free to go wherever they want, but LJP is with NDA,” he said.
 
 On Friday, Chirag Paswan had said in New Delhi that BJP should rework its strategy following its crushing defeat in UP bypolls.
 
 HAM-S neta meets Kushwaha: Amid rumours of rift in the NDA in Bihar, a closed-door meeting between RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha and HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan was held at Ara circuit house on Friday. Kushwaha, however, termed it a courtesy meeting. “RLSP is very much with NDA,” he said.
