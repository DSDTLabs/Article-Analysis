NEW DELHI: It was a fruitful   for   as   set out across different parts of Delhi NCR for the   of the  , results of which came out on Wednesday. A total of   were   this year – a sharp drop from the 195 species which were recorded last year. However birders attributed this to an early summer and the fact that the count was organised by the end of May instead of early May, so no “winter migrants” were recorded.

 
 
  
 
 “In the previous years, the summer bird count was held in early May and we usually had 35-40 lingering winter migrants making it to our total species count. To avoid that, we have held the count much later this year and therefore we’ve seen a drop in the number. As a result only 10 lingering migrants were recorded,” said Kanwar B Singh, a birder and organiser of the event.
 
 Singh said that 90 birders took part this time, including two teams consisting only of children. A team led by Brigadier Arvind Yadav covered the bird habitats along the Najafgarh drain, with a total of 108 different species recorded there, including the oriental pratincole that breed there during the summer months. The team also managed to sight a ruddy-breasted crake – an uncommon bird usually found in the reedbeds.
 
 At the Yamuna floodplains, a total of 90 species were recorded which included summer breeding residents like little tern, cotton pygmy-goose, white-tailed stonechat and river lapwing among others. For the first time in the count, the neighbouring district of Rewari was also covered with a team led by Dr Parikshit Yadav recording 103 species. A number of uncommon and important sightings were also made in Mangar and Damdama lake which included the sighting of the Indian pitta – a breeding visitor to forest patches in the area.
