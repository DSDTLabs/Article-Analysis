LUCKNOW: For a 53 year-old widow  , who came all the way from Palia on Friday, those few thousand rupee notes meant having food for the next few months. "My husband died last December, since past 3 months I have been trying to make ends meet, I have nobody to earn for me. So many of my problems can be solved if these old notes get exchanged", she told TOI. 

 Neelam found a bag with Rs 9,000 in her deceased husband's cupboard while cleaning. Likewise, a resident of Alambagh, Jyotsana Upadhaya, found Rs 5,000 in denominations of Rs 500.
 
 Hundreds of people thronged the Gomtinagar situated   (RBI) on March 31 in order to give a last try for exchanging the old currency notes. More women turned in with small denomination amounts which many claimed to have found during house cleaning for Holi. "Do you see anyone here who has come in a car? No, are we being troubled because of being poor", said an agitated Nupur, who came in from Sitapur to try her luck. "We are not demanding to change in lakhs but in few thousands. How can we throw the money which we have earned with hard work", said another young woman in her 20s.
 
 The enraged crowd blocked a police vehicle and demanded an explanation as to why they were being turned down while the Non-Residents Indians (NRI) were allowed to exchange  .
