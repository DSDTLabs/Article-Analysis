NEW DELHI: Confronted with the state government’s inability to deliver on the poll promise of adding 10,000 buses to the existing  , deputy chief minister Manish   said that the existing size of buses does not match the ‘structure’ of Delhi. He was referring to the narrow lanes of the city and gave the example of his constituency, Patparganj.

 Sisodia was speaking at the   hosted by   on Wednesday. He said the plan is to introduce smaller buses in the near future and replace the existing ones, which according to him are ‘oversized’.
 
 “Most buses run empty owing to their size that doesn’t match the existing infrastructure of the city. In Patparganj, buses are not able to follow their routes mainly due to the narrow lanes of unauthorised colonies,” he said.
 
 Addressing the issue of increasing pollution levels in the capital and the steps taken by the government to curb it, Sisosia said that there is no ultimate solution and the odd-even rule is only a ‘fire-fighting’ measure. With municipal polls getting closer, the deputy CM raised the issue of corruption regarding waste management. “There are over 36,000 safai karamcharis on paper out of which around 10,000 are ‘ghost’ employees whose salaries go into someone else’s pocket.” 
 
 He also commented on the importance of the land pooling policy. “People sell their land instead of giving it to the government. We have only asked for 10% to carry out developmental projects,” Sisodia added.
