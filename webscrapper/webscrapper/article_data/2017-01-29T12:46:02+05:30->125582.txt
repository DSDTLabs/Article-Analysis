 rang in his 32nd with a bash at mentor Karan Johar's Bandra residence on Sunday night. The birthday boy's steady date, Alia Bhatt, was among the first guests to arrive with sister Shaheen in tow.
'It was an informal gathering and Sidharth was happy to have his friends around him on his special day. He cut two-three cakes as everyone surrounded him to sing the birthday song,' informs a guest from the party.
 
 Besides Sid, Alia was the centre of attention at the do as guests flocked around her to congratulate her on the Best Actress win at the recently concluded 62nd JIO Filmfare Awards. The 23-year-old actress had snagged the top honour for her portrayal of a down-on-luck Bihari immigrant in Abhishek Chaubey's dark drug drama Udta Punjab. While she refrained from wishing Sid `happy birthday' on the social media, elder sister Shaheen was more forthcoming, taking to Instagram to describe the actor as 'one of the best people I know'.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Most of Sidharth's leading ladies, including his 'Baar Baar Dekho' love, Katrina Kaif, 'Hasee Toh Phasee' heroine, Parineeti Chopra, Reload co-star Jacqueline Fernandez, and Sonakshi Sinha, with whom he'll soon start shooting for the 'Ittefaq' remake, were in attendance. Karan's director buddy Ayan Mukerji was there too along with Farhan Akhtar and designers Kunal Rawal and Manish Malhotra. The surprise guest was Imran Khan who was accompanied by wife Avantika. In 2014, Karan and the actor had a fallout after the debacle of 'Gori Tere Pyaar Mein' but have since mended fences. The revelry continued well past midnight, with the last of the guests filing out around 4 am.
