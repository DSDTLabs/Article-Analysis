GAYA: Hollywood heartthrob   arrived at   on Friday along with his Spanish girlfriend Alejandra Silva to participate in the ongoing Kalchakra rituals being conducted by Buddhist spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.
 
  The twice divorced actor, who has films like Pretty Woman, Unfaithful and Gentleman to his credit, is a long time disciple of the Dalai Lama and has been espousing the cause of the Tibetans presently under Chinese occupation.
  
  Gere’s arrival has added colour to the religious event. Soon after reaching here, Gere headed towards the prayer venue at   close to Buddha’s seat of enlightenment to receive the sermon delivered by the Dalai Lama. In 2012 also, Richard, who had infamously hit the headlines for hugging Bollywood actor  , camped in Bodh Gaya for the entire Kalchakra duration.
  
  In his sermon on the second day, the Dalai Lama dealt with the cause effect relationship between man/woman’s deeds and its end results. “Good deeds yield good results and vice versa,” said the spiritual leader. Taking the discourse to a higher philosophical level, the spiritual leader said heart and not limbs perform the deed. Limbs are just instruments and the real command comes from the heart and as such purity of heart was a must for the performance of good deeds.
