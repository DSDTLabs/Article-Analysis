GREATER NOIDA: Altogether 31 people have been booked for brandishing   and other sharp-edged   during a rally in   two days ago.

 Shailendra Pratap Singh, SHO of Kasna police station, said some members of the Rajputana Samaj had on Sunday organised a rally without taking permission of the district administration. According to sub-inspector Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, who lodged the complaint, members of the outfit had organised a programme to welcome a community leader,  , in Ghodi Bachera village where they allegedly displayed swords and other weapons and violated traffic norms.
 
 “They also played loud music with a DJ and burst firecrackers that added to noise pollution. Vehicles were stranded on the road near   for some time because of them,” he said.
 
 Balyan said he came to know about the rally through media reports the next day, following which he filed the complaint. 
 
 Singh said a case had been registered under sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 153 (promoting enmity between two groups) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC. Police have launched a search to arrest those involved in the rally.
