Coimbatore: PMK leader S   has said cultivable agricultural land in Tamil Nadu had shrunk by several folds over the past few decades and blamed Dravidian parties for failing agriculture.

 In a statement on Wednesday, Ramadoss alleged that from 6, 601 sq km in 1971, the agricultural area has come down to 4, 806 sq km in 2014. “This is a 27% fall in the agricultural land in 44 years,’’ he said citing a study conducted by retired professor of Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) S Janakarajan.
 
 The study funded by the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), the study was conducted between 2014 and 2016 and covers a period spanning more than four decades from the 1971.
 
 While agricultural land has fallen, the extent of barren land has increased from 70.3 sq km to 926 sq km during the same period, he said.
 
 He said successive Tamil Nadu governments over the last 50 years failed to implement any major irrigation projects after the period of chief minister Kamaraj. The state government also failed to tackle interstate water disputes like Cauvery and Mullaperiyar, leading to drastic fall in agricultural area, he alleged.
