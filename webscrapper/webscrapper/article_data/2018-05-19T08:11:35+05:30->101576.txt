LUCKNOW: The poor status of   collection has led   to seek help from Lucknow   Rail Corporation ( ) for the tax paying process.

 
 People can pay up to Rs 3,000 tax through Metro ‘GoSmart’ cards at Metro stations.
 
 A major reason why people have been reluctant to pay house tax is the time taken and inconvenience faced while queuing up at LMC office. The pact with LMRC will provide ease to pay taxes at Metro stations, especially to residents on the operational Metro corridor.
 
 LMRC has already prepared and submitted a software for it to LMC. LMRC staff at the station’s counter will feed in bill details in the software and a tax-payer can tally it with the bill he/she has received. The payment can be made by swiping the Metro card. A receipt will be instantly provided.
 
 As a special facility, payment of up to Rs 3,000 can also be made in cash. LMRC is also working on a software to enable its ticket machines to accept payments.
 
 The official in charge of the project in LMRC said, “The project is designed such that all money collected against house tax bills would be parked in a system under LMC’s name and transferred to its account.”
 
 Though the project is ready, implementations is stuck at a point of disagreement. While LMRC proposes that only the payment should be online and the tax-payer should know their tax history beforehand, LMC insists that LMRC should integrate LMC’s entire software with its own so that a person can see their tax history at a Metro station.
 
 MD   said, “For privacy and convenience of people, only the payment part should be with LMRC. If we integrate the entire software, we would have to access data of other agencies. We are in talks with LMC for consensus.”
