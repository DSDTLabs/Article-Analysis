NEW DELHI: A day after a 40-year-old bootlegger admitted to have sexually assaulted children at Vijay Vihar, cops are trying to identify other   who might not have approached them fearing a stigma. A police team has approached three government schools in the area where the accused, Naresh, used to lurk around looking for victims. 

 Initial probe revealed that since 2007, Naresh had been caught many times by locals but eventually let off. His forays, however, reduced from 2009 when laws protecting children against sexual abuse were made stronger. 
 
 Locals at Vijay Vihar part II, where Naresh stayed, said that he and his brother ran an illegal liquor business at their house and often created ruckus in the area. “We generally did not register complaints fearing attack by his family,” said a neighbour.
 
 The area comprises mostly labourers from UP and Bihar who often leave their children unattended when they go to work. 
 
 Police said they had contacted victims in three   cases that have surfaced in the city and requested them to register complaints. 
 
 Cops had zeroed in on at least three more incidents by tallying the identity of the victims with the place and time of the incident after interrogating Naresh. They are also trying to locate the accused’s friends who helped him get away every time he was caught abusing a child. Police said so far one of the victim’s parents have identified him.
 
 Naresh claimed he had first sexually abused a relative’s daughter, which wasn’t reported as well. He usually stalked a child for a few days before attacking. He generally targeted children between age four and 10. He would lure them with sweets and then gag them. 
 
 Cops have requested principals to speak to children and find out whether there were other victims.
