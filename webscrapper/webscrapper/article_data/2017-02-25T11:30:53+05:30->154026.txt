After winning applause for his performance as 'Gautamiputra Satakarni' in his 100th outing, Nandamuri   is on a high. The actor, who is apparently juggling between his career in films and in politics has however made his next step clear, in terms of his movies. 

 Maverick director  , who is known to make a straight point with close-to-real story lines and dialogues, is now going to direct the actor, who has a totally different image as a mass entertainer. The combination sounds very crazy and fans of the respective director and actor are looking forward to know more about their collaboration and the project.
