JODHPUR:   between Jodhpur and Jaisalmer was   on Monday. A nine-seater Cessena Grand Carvan aircraft by private airlines   landed at Jaisalmer airport on Monday afternoon, becoming the first ever passenger flight to have landed in Jaisalmer.

 Confirming the trial to be a successful move, CEO of the Supreme Aviation   said that it was the first trial and the second trial was scheduled on February 8.
 
 “If all the hurdles are cleared, we would be the first one to link two important tourist destinations of the state – Jodhpur and Jaisalmer by air route,” Agarwal said.
 
 He said that the first trial had to take place on December 13 but given some issues with the air port authority and the defence, most importantly pertaining to the security, the plan had to be shelved.
 
 A meeting with the state government led to resolution of these issues, wherein the government took the responsibility to address the security issues and Monday was fixed for the first trial. 
 
 However, there are still some issues to be addressed on part of the airport authority and the defence, like installation of the Instrument Landing System (ILS), which enables landing during low vision.
 
 “But all these would be addressed in a meeting scheduled with the state governemnt, Air Force and the airport authority on February 9, after which the final schedule of the flight   would be finalised,” Agarwal said.
 
 It is noteworthy that Jaislamer airport has been lying ready for a long time awaiting flights to be operational from here. An estimated Rs 100 crore has been spent on this airport.
 
 Supreme Aviation has been operating two flights for Jaipur and one each for Bikaner and Udaipur from Jodhpur daily, for past three months.
