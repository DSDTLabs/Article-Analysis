Since 2013, he had cleared drains several times and also shredded tree branches as ordered. However, he said, his pending payment amounted to Rs 13 lakh.
 
 District forest officer   said a budget is provided to zoo every financial year and they are the ones who deal with contractors. Additional SP Lucknow (east)   said Singh had been asked to give bills so that the matter could be pursued.
