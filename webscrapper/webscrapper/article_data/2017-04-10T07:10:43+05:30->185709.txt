CHENNAI: Opposition parties on Sunday demanded that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his entire cabinet resign and state health minister C Vijayabaskar, on whose premises IT raids were launched, be arrested for having masterminded distribution of money to voters in R K Nagar constituency. DMK, PMK, CPM and other parties demanded a CBI probe into allegations of large-scale bribery as indicated by documents seized by I-T sleuths.

 "The income tax raids and seizure of documents show money was distributed to voters in R K Nagar. It is a shame for Tamil Nadu," said DMK working president   speaking to reporters before beginning his campaign in the constituency on Sunday. The R K Nagar byelection is to be held on April 12.
 
 PMK chief S Ramadoss demanded that the chief minister drop Vijayabaskar from the cabinet. "There are several documents to show that money was distributed by Vijayabaskar. He has no moral right to continue as minister,” Ramadoss said in a party release. He said governor   should order arrest of Vijayabaskar and a probe into the entire episode.
 
 CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan accused both the Dravidian parties of distributing money to voters. “We have information about Vijayabaskar and   (Amma) distributing or planning to distribute money. But there are also reports of DMK bribing voters and some of its cadres even being arrested,” said Ramakrishnan.
