  : There is a spike in the number of MLAs offering to vacate their seats for the newly appointed chief minister  , so that he could contest by-election. A day after Campierganj MLA Fateh Bahdaur made the first offer, three more MLAs came forward on Tuesday. 

 The first was Vipin Singh, the MLA from   Rural, Yogi's native place. Vipin had emerged as a giant-killer, defeating BJP's turncoat and sitting MLA  , who contested on an SP ticket. On Tuesday, Vipin, in a press statement, said: "I have reached Vidhan Sbha with the blessings of Yogi ji. Now, it's the desire of the people that he should contest from   seat to reach assembly. I offer to relinquish by seat for him and people of Gorakhur Rural would ensure that he emerges victorious by a record margin."
 
 Two other MLAs from Jhansi, too offered to resign their assembly seats to enable Yogi to contest election from their seats. The chief minister, who at present is Lok Sabha MP, will be required to become either an MLA or MLC within six months.
 
 Ravi Sharma, MLA from Jhansi Sadar, who won his seat for the second time, said on Tuesday that he would like the CM to contest from his seat. "If he (Yogi) wins from Bundelkhand, which is quite a backward region, he will certainly develop it, and this what the people of this place want. I therefore request him to contest from Jhansi Sadar seat," said Sharma.
 
 Similarly, Jawahar Singh Rajput, the first-time MLA from Garotha assembly constituency, also offered his seat to the CM. "It will be a boon for all of us if Yogi contests from this seat. We believe he will change the face of the entire Bundelkhand region which has been languishing in backwardness since a long time", said Rajput, a grass-roots-level farmer leader who had defeated a two-time heavyweight SP MLA, Deepnarayan Singh Yadav.
