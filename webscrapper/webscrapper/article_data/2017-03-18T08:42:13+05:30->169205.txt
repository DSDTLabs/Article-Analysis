MUMBAI: Sahar police arrested a 32-year-old Kalyan resident on Thursday for allegedly   and   with an air-hostess on a Dubai-  flight and then an immigration   at the city’s international airport. 

 When informed that liquor would not be served on flight, an “inebriated” Darshan Hatnolkar reportedly threatened an air-hostess and, upon landing, spoke inappropriately with an   official. 
 
 He was detained at the immigration wing in-charge’s cabin where he allegedly threatened the two by saying he had clicked their pictures and he would “misuse them on social media”. 
 
 Hatnolkar holds a hotel management degree and is employed as a steward in a star hotel in the UAE. “Hatnolkar, who was in an inebriated condition, fought with an air-hostess. Matters worsened when he kept staring at a female immigration employee and repeatedly passed lewd comments,” said Sahar police senior inspector B T Mukhedkar.
 
 In the complaint, the 28-year-old immigration official said, “Hatnolkar kept staring at me. When I did not react, he told me to not be shy and asked me look at him. He repeated this three times. I alerted the wing in-charge who took the flyer to his cabin where I was called too. The air-hostess of the   in which he arrived was called in too. In the cabin, he threatened to upload our photos on social media.” He was handed over to CSIF who got him arrested at Sahar police station. 
 
 He was produced before Andheri metropolitan magistrate court on Friday. 
 
 Judge J S Mali sent him to police custody till March 20. He was booked under IPC sections 353 (deterring a public servant from duty), 504 (insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman).
