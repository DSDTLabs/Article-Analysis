CHANDIGARH:   on Monday decided to advertise 27 posts of assistant professor for different departments. Sources said PU vice-chancellor Prof   was of the view that since the Union ministry of human resource and development (MHRD) had permitted the varsity to fill up vacant posts, it should not further delay the process. 

 It is after a gap of three years that PU will fill up vacant teaching spots after the MHRD had communicated this to the university in January this year. The Union government had frozen university's recruitment process following financial crisis that which had escalated. 
 
 The senate members in the past had raised the issue that the matter needed to be taken up with the   since there were departments where there was only one teacher. The university had written to the MHRD and UGC submitting the same.
 
 Moreover, the admission schedule of various teaching departments for the 2018-19 session was also tabled in the meeting. 
 
 The faculty members were asked to update their CVs on the university website by June 30 and submit their annual reports as well.
