COIMBATORE: After a two-year-long  , industries under the   Small Industries Development Corporation Limited (Tansidco) have got their land value revoked from zero to the   guideline value.

 The development will help industrialist to pledge their land and borrow loans for expanding business, sources said.
 
 Coimbatore Sidco Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association chief N V Loganathan said, “We received a communication from   Corporations authorities that the director of land reforms has revoked the 2015 order that nullified the value of the industrial estate’s land.”
 
 In April 2015, when one of the industrialists had approached the registrar of land reforms to obtain mortgage documents, he was informed that the land value of survey numbers 172 and 186 have been nullified as they were purchased under the Bhoodan movement. It had put many industrialists in a fix as they could not borrow loans from banks, nor could sell their land after incurring loss in the business.
 
 Speaking to TOI, the owner of a foundry said, “I have been trying to borrow loan from a bank and my industrial land is a most valuable asset against which I can get the money. I have suffered huge loss in my business because of the 2015 direction from the director of land reforms.” 
 
 Some of the industrialists, who either have the land idle or have been looking to sell their industries off due to loss, have not been able to do so. 
 
 The Coimbatore Sidco Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association had approached the district administration to help them resolve the problem. Following a petition, Sidco authorities produced the documents pertaining to the procurement of lands from the Bhoodan movement, and the director of land reforms issued an order revoking the 2015 order.
