MUMBAI:   chief   met   president   in Mumbai on Friday triggering speculation of new political equations in the state. The meeting, held at Pawar’s Nepean Sea Road residence, lasted 40 minutes, it is learnt.

 
 There were reports that Raj requested Pawar to attend the MNS’ Gudi Padwa jamboree at   on Sunday where the MNS president is scheduled to address his followers. 
 
 For all practical purposes, Raj will flag off his party’s election campaign at the rally, it is said. Raj is believed to have told his party colleagues to tell mediapersons his meeting with Pawar was merely a courtesy call.
 
 NCP sources said Pawar could be thinking of having the MNS on board the Congress-NCP alliance in   in a bid to woo Marathi voters. The idea is to make it tough for   to bond with the ‘sons of the soil,’ said analysts.
