MUMBI:   said on Wednesday that it has been given additional time till June 30, 2017 to bring down promoter stake in the bank to 30% from 33.6% as on December 2016. As per the earlier timeline, Kotak Bank needed to dilute promoter stake to 30% by December 2016. 

 In a statement issued to the stock exchanges, the private bank said it has received a communication from RBI to bring down its promoter shareholding to 30% by June 30, 2017, 20% by December 31, 2018 and 15% by March 31, 2020.
 
 Given the current valuation of the bank at 1.42 lakh crore, the promoters would have to sell stake worth 5,150 crore in the next five months. In case the dilution has to be achieved through a combination of fresh issue of shares, the fund rising must be higher. 
 
 The central bank had given the timeline for stake reduction in 2012. At that time, RBI had said that private banks would need to bring down promoter holding to 20%. However, Kotak Bank was an exception as it was created following conversion of an NBFC into a bank. RBI had asked the bank to bring down its promoter stake (then at 45.2%) to 20% by March 31, 2018.
 
 The promoter's stake in the bank is held by Uday Kotak, vice chairman and CEO and his family members.  's holding in the bank came down to around 34% from 39.7% last year as a result of the merger with ING Bank.
