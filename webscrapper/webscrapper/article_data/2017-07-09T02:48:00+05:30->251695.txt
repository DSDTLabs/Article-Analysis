Hyderabad: The Telangana State Road transport Corporation ( ) may have increased its fleet over the last few years from nearly 3000 to 3800 in the city, but commuters demand buses for new areas and increase in the frequency of buses. Several representations have been made to this effect during RTC’s monthly 'dial your RTC officer' meetings. Also a frequent complain received was that a large number of buses continue to ply without having a destination board making it difficult for passengers.

 Commuters alleged that the TRSTC has not addressed their problems. “If you stand at Secunderabad bus station, 60 out of 100 buses stopping at the station will either not have a destination board or it cannot be read. Sometimes during evening hours one has to wait for at least 30 minutes to get on a bus because 10 to 20 buses would be missed for want of clear destination board,” said Shankaran Iyer, a frequent traveller.
 
 Also the digital display boards are sometimes not operational, commuters allege. “Buses coming to Bandlaguda depot do not display boards and hence are not picking up passengers. By the time a passenger realizes the bus destination, the bus had crossed the road,” complained another commuter P Prabhadevi.
 
 The areas where the need for new bus services is felt are Shankermutt, Ibrahimpatnam and Nadergul. TSRTC authorities said the change in travel pattern in the city is largely from the east to west. This has made a number of RTC routes unprofitable. Also the demand for direct connectivity from Alwal to Afzalgunj, Shankermutt to Jubilee Bus Station, Nadergul to LB Nagar and direct bus connectivity from Kachiguda railway station to the Jubilee Bus Station has been met.
 
 Officials said many routes have been realigned. About 20 new routes were introduced in the last one year.
