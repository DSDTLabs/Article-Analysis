AHMEDABAD: Some students offer   for money. That, according to Anand police, is one of the findings of its confidential survey covering students in hostels in about 100 educational institutes in Anand and the satellite towns of   and Karamsad. 

 
 Anand superintendent of police   said that the survey was conducted over two months. “The survey revealed that some boys and girls practise prostitution,”   said. He said that he had no precise numbers. “Fifty percent of the students surveyed are addicted to alcohol, drugs, or smoking,” a senior police official said. About 65,000 students study in the education hub. The sample size of the survey, however, is unknown. “In some cases, we found that tea stall owners supply drugs and liquor. However, the quantity of drugs in their possession does not warrant a raid,” the official said. The question of possession of liquor in the dry state was not addressed. “We are going to conduct another survey once the new academic year starts from June 11,” the official said. He did not have the break-up of the student numbers under various addiction categories. 
 
 A top police official said that the survey was carried out because the police had been receiving inputs about undesirable activities in the educational zone. “We confidentially roped in a few hostel rectors to understand student details,” Chauhan said. “They proved to be of great help because they know about the movements of students. We took information from tea stall owners as well. A few student representatives also helped us gather information.” 
 
 According to police officials, the survey covered students in the 18-21 age group. The officials said some students who were around 25 years old were also included, adding that such students could be pursuing research or PhD. “With the start of the new academic year, we will take some corrective measures, including carrying out raids,” Chauhan said. “We will also organize de-addiction and counselling centres.”
