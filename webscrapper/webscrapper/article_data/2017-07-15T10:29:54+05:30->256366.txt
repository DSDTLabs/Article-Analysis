HYDERABAD: Osmania General Hospital, one of the oldest hospitals in the country, continues to be in a state of disrepair even as the poor standards at the heritage building have been brought to the notice of the authorities several times in the past. Complaints of poor facilties have only inspired knee-jerk quick fixes that fail to do much for the buildings. 

 In the latest reaction, the walls of the hospital have been sprayed with bleaching powder to cover up the spit marks, But this has led to a pervading pungent stench in the wards. Sanitation is almost non-existent and even as the building has shown signs of crumbling in the past, hardly any restoration work has been taken up. 
 
 Founded in 1910 during the reign of  , the then   of Hyderabad, the hospital has been the choice of several patients for different issues over the years, but it doesn't seem to be able to stand up to the patients' expectations. Dearth of beds in the outpatient wards force patients and their kin to settle down on the floor. 
 
 "Even the security personnel are corrupt and accept bribes very easily to let people inside," said  , one of the patients' kin.
 
 The floors and bathrooms are rarely cleaned properly, which has led to an unpleasant smell across the hospital. The roof has cracks through which water seeps into the building during rains. The second floor of the building is said to have been renovated, but the water still seeps in through the ceilings and collects on the hospital floor.
 
 "We have relocated patients from unsafe zones of the building such as the second floor to give way to the renovation work," said Dr. Kavita, the only RMO of the hospital who agreed to talk to TOI. 
 
 The superintendent of the hospital, Dr. G. V. S. Moorthy, refused to talk and passed the buck to the RMOs.
