INDORE: Chief minister   on Wednesday said attempts are being made by his government to provide job-oriented education to the youth to ensure that they get employment through skill-sets they develop in the classrooms.

 “There is a huge gap in our country with the kind of skills required by companies and skills taught in schools and colleges. Vocational training is must and that’s where the colleges are lacking. The government is pushing for job-oriented education,” Chouhan said, inaugurating skill development centre at Symbiosis University of Applied Sciences.
 
 He promised students better approach roads to the institute that has come up on Super Corridor. 
 
 Chouhan who had come during the foundation laying ceremony was happy to see the campus. He said, “We had given you an uneven land, now we see a beautiful university. Why students of Indore would go to Mumbai, Pune and Delhi? When our students can study in the city. Now that this university has opened, students even from other cities and states should come to study here.”
 
 The residential university that is built on an area of 8 lakh sq feet is the first university to have skilled based courses and over 800 students are already studying here at present.
 
 Addressing the gathering, university’s pro-chancellor Dr   said institute’s skill development courses are devised in consultation with companies as per the requirements of the industry and using the set parameters. 
 
 Main focus of the institute is on giving practical education to students, therefore practical weighs 70% in the academics, she said.
 
 There are regular visits and seminars by officials of various companies and regulatory organizations like Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI),   ( ),   (PFRDA), she said adding the university also offers courses related to banking, retail management, automobile, computer science, and mechatronics.
