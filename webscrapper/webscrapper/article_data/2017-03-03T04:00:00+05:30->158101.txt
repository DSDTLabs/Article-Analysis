Ahmedabad: Revenue minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama has assured the state assembly they will be open to make changes if discrepancies are reported in the land records emerging from resurveying by the government .

 The minister in the state assembly told MLAs that these land records were prepared using Electronic Total Station (ETS) and Global Positioning System (GPS).
 
 The minister was replying to allegations that there were discrepancies in land records from the government’s technology-aided survey. Congress MLA C K Raulji alleged that there were major discrepancies reported by farmers in land records and the measurement of their land decreased while that of their neighbours had increased.
 
 Chudasama said that in the state’s 18,081 villages, there were 1.25 crore survey numbers for various land parcels. Of these, 1.25 crore survey numbers, the state had completed measurements for of 97%. The state has so far received 7.45 lakh applications against the technology-aided measurements and 6.80 lakh had been resolved or corrected.
 
 He further said that the government was still open to genuine complaints. Officials said survey records were outdated and 20% to 25% of records had also been lost, destroyed or mutilated and the government hence opted to resurvey with land using modern technology.
