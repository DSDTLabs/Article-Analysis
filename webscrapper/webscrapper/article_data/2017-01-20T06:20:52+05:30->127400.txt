When he opened his shop on Thursday morning, he found a mouse trapped and went to release it in the nearby Safidon block government rest house. However, as he was about to set the rodent free in the sprawling resthouse premises, he was spotted by Safidon SDM Jag Niwas and called inside. Under fire from the angry SDM, the trader trapped the mouse again. But this did not pacify the SDM, who called the   Officer Vikas Kumar and got him arrested.
 
 When other traders got to know of this, they blocked the railway road to seek the release of Jain The blockade led to huge traffic snarls and forced the administration to release the trader after one and half hours. By that time, the trapped mouse had died in the trap.
 
 Safidon SHO Vikas Kumar told mediapersons that he was only obeying orders.   said he was not aware of the matter and was trying to reach the SDM.
