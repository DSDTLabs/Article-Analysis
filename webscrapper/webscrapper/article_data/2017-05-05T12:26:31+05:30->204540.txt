For the last fiscal, Rs 4,500 crore was allocated for the scheme that covered   families also. Under the scheme, states were buying sugar from the open market at wholesale rates and selling at a subsidised rate of Rs 13.50 per kg through PDS. The Centre was providing subsidy of Rs 18.50 per kg to states. LUX ARD
