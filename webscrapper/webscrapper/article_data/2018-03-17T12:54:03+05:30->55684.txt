PATNA: The state science and technology (S&T) department has decided to take up its ambitious   project associated with   and start it afresh after a gap of six years.

 Initially formulated in 2012, the project aims at preserving and developing three historical locations —  , Taregna and Taregna Top — associated with renowned astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata. The places, located at a distance of approximately 35km from Patna, are considered as centres for all astronomical studies Aryabhata conducted. Their aerial distance from each other forms an equilateral triangle.
 
 “Way back in 2012, the science and technology department had invited Expression of Interest for selection of a consultancy firm to provide its services as a master planning consultant and conceptualize the whole project. Accordingly, eight entries were received, but somehow the plan could not materialise,” S&T director   said on Friday and added a fresh bidding process had been recently initiated to rope in a private firm as master consultant for the project.
 
 Both Taregna and Khagaul have astronomical associations. ‘Taregana’ comes from the Sanskrit term taraka-gnana (calculating stars) and ‘Khagaul’ is said to have originated from khagol (astronomy). Historians from Bihar claim that Aryabhata was born in Taregna. His works, on the other hand, were centred in Khagaul where he set up an observatory for recording the movement of celestial bodies.
 
 According to Sinha, the government will develop the three locations as tourist attractions in order to popularise them among common people and demonstrate the history and development of science in Bihar. 
 
 “Each place will have a small museum and an observatory. While the museums will have pictures and literature on Aryabhata’s life and contributions to astronomy, the observatories will have telescopes and other astronomical gadgets for people to view celestial events,” he told this reporter.
