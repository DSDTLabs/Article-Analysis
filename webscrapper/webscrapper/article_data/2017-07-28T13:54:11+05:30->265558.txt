PANCHKULA: The Panchkula-Barwala   was closed for about two hours and the traffic diverted towards Derabassi after an old bridge on the highway got damaged and fell down on a teporary road due to rain on Thursday.

 As per the local cops, the four-laning work on the national highway-73 had been going on and the old bridge over the Mankaya and   river near Mattewala village was closed due to repairs while the new bridge was still under construction. The traffic was being made to pass through a temporary road made between the bridges. But due to the rain and the increased river water flow the temporary road was blocked and part of the old bridge also fell down on the road.
 
 The police stated that traffic was diverted through Derabassi and a JCB was called to remove the debris from the temporary road. However, commuters had to take a long way around due to a diversion made through Derabassi. One of the commuters  , said that, “I had to go to Derabassi first for coming to Panchkula due to the road closure.” ITBP officials were called in and they helped the pedestrians cross the road.
