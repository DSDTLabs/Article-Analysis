CHENNAI: For many residents of  , sewage flowing from nearby Padi into their house compounds, sumps and water lines has left them sleepless at nights for the past 20 days. 

 According to them, corporation officials have diverted the flow of sewage from areas near Padi and   into the 4,000-ft long storm water drain (SWD) in   Sector-B, in order to widen the   canal. SWD inlets into the canal have been blocked to carry out work under the integrated SWD project.
 
 When A  's wife filled a bucket of water last Wednesday, she was surprised to find it foaming. "That was just the beginning. We are unable to use water from our sumps for anything at all," said Chokalingam, who since February 16, has been trying to get the attention of zonal and SWD department officials.
 
 He added that this was not the first time that the corporation diverted sewage from nearby areas. "After the October rains, we faced a similar issue as sewage was diverted this way, instead of the canal and subsequently into the Cooum. After complaints and protests, the diversion was arrested then."
 
 Residents pointed out that the problem is two-fold. "As the level of this SWD is much lower than that of the Padi Kuppam canal, sewage remains stagnant for most of the year. This shows the foolish engineering of the drain," Chokalingam added. "Even though they deployed people to pump out water, the work was carried out for two days only." Another resident, David, said the issue has resulted in the ubiquitous presence of mosquitoes.
 
 A corporation engineer, when contacted, said the SWD network in the Sector-B will be connected to the Ambatur SIDCO canal after its deepening, which will be taken up in two months. 
 
 "Till then, we will be regularly pumping out sewage water from the SWD," he said.
