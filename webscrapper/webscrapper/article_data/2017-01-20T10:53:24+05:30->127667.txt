BHUBANESWAR: Fans stood in queues for a glimpse of their favourite players along the   road that the players took from their hotel to the   on Thursday. It resulted in massive   on the route. 

 "We were stranded for around 15 to 20 minutes at major traffic squares. Even the progress of traffic was very slow due to barricades and restriction on flow of traffic on major city roads," said Amaresh Padhi, an office-goer. 
 
 People were seen in huge numbers in front of hotels where players stayed in Nayapalli and along the roads where their vehicles passed. Tight security arrangements were made all along the road with barricades put up at every thoroughfare. The players started from hotel between 10.30 and 11 am, which is the peak hour when many people go to office and schools. 
 
 When the buses carrying players started from the hotel, excited fans shouted slogans and cheered Team India. "My son's preschool gets over at 11 am. But my auto-rickshaw was stuck up in the traffic jam at Jaydev Vihar for more than 20 minutes. By the time I reached school all children had left," said Bharati Panda, a homemaker. 
 
 However, police said they ensured smooth traffic movement along the route. "Security of the players was the top priority. Nowhere an ambulance or any emergency vehicle was stopped. It was a matter of minutes and people should cooperate instead of complaining," said a traffic policeman. 
 
 Debendra Mandal, a fan standing in front of the hotel said, "It is indeed a rare occasion when we get an opportunity to get a glimpse of our favourite cricket player. I don't want to miss the chance".
