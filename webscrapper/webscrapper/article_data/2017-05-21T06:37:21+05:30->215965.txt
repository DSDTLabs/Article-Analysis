LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party president   on Saturday said he would attend RJD’s ‘BJP Bhagao Desh Bachao’ rally in Patna on August 27. Coming in the backdrop of recent raids by the income tax department at the residence of   chief  , the rally is being seen as a fresh attempt of the former Bihar CM to bring together opposition parties to form a front against the BJP.

 “I got a call from the RJD chief and have accepted the invitation. I will attend the rally in Patna,” he said talking to the media after a meeting with the traders at the party office on Saturday. 
 
 Taking a dig at BSP chief Mayawati,   said she was no longer in a position to be re-elected as a Raya Sabha MP and will need the help of another political party as BSP no longer had the required numbers.
 
 The SP chief took on the ruling BJP government in the state for the spate of recent transfers in the police department claiming that such an exercise was in vain.
