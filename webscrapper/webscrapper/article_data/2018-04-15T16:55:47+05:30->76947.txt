A silent dance-drama   was staged at the 2nd day of the ongoing   festival on Saturday. 
Based on the age-old Dravidian cultural rituals, the play depicts a universe that absorbs all imbalances like a black hole from which rebirth of everything anew is possible. It is presented through the ultimate union of   (male) and   (female) energies and the birth, destruction and rebirth of the universe.
 
  
  
 The theatrical experience takes the audience through the separation of Purusha from Prakriti that destroys the universe through mythical characters including Iphigenie, Ophelia, Medee and Kali; the destruction is not permanent, as nothing is. Only in the powerful destruction of the world and all its constituent materials and forms by Karuppu (Dark) energy is the reunion of consciousness and nature possible giving rebirth to all of existence.
