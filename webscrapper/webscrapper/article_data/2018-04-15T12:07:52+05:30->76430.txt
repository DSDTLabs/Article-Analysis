VIJAYAWADA:   went out of gear in Vijayawada and Guntur on Saturday due to   chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s walkathon into Krishna district.

 When   was coming to Vijayawada from Tadepalli in the morning, one side of   was blocked with scores of YSRC activists taking out a rally. The police had to hold Kolkata-bound heavy vehicle at Tadepalli, till the bridge was clear. Vijayawada-bound two-wheelers and four-wheelers were diverted onto the Prakasam barrage in view of the padayatra. Commuters had to wait for hours in traffic as there was severe bottle neck on the barrage. Though the city traffic police deployed heavy numbers and made diversions wherever possible, it took them two hours to bring normalcy between Vijayawada and Guntur.
 
 The traffic woes did not end there as Jagan’s procession had just started the padayatra into the city. With minutes Jagan entering the city, all arterial roads were clogged. The supporters of   who switched sides from Telugu Desam Party to YSRC, also caused traffic problems with their bike rallies.
