VADODARA: The   (VMC) too swung into action following the death of a school student on the   road. The civic body cleared encroachments in the area and will also be conducting a survey of constructions in the area.

 Teams of the encroachment, building permission and town planning departments of the civic body reached the   area where heavy congestion of vehicles is witnessed. The building permission and town planning department teams will be surveying the area in the coming days.
 
 VMC encroachment and security director   said that the VMC teams seized 10 handcarts operating in the area. The teams also seized two truckloads of other material that was encroaching on the roads. Six benches that were kept on the roadside were also shifted to an internal road. Four platforms of complexes in the area that were encroachments were also razed.
 
 If more irregularities and extra constructions in buildings come to light during the surveys by the building permission and town planning department, more action will be taken by the civic body. The civic body has also expressed willingness to cooperate to ensure that vehicles are not parked illegally in the area.
 
 “If keeping seized vehicles in large numbers is a problem, we can give them space in the   store where seized cabins and handcarts are kept,” said an official.
