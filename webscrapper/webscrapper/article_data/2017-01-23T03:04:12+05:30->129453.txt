NAVI MUMBAI: The great-grandson of Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy, who financed the construction of  , has petitioned the Bombay high court that the railway land belonged to his grandfather and it be handed over to him.   Adamjee Peerbhoy has also demanded a CBI inquiry against the Government of India’s claim on the land.
 
 “The case is being heard. My great-grandfather had spent Rs16 lakh for purchasing the land, commissioning the railway track, buying the engine, etc. The train service was commenced during my grandfather Abdul Hussain’s time. A huge land parcel of 280 acres from Neral to Matheran railway station, passing through Juma Pati and  , plus the estate, is ours,” Ali Akbar said. He alleged that the shutting down of the toy train service, which linked Matheran and Neral, is a “conspiracy” to avoid paying the family dues of Rs16 lakh (services were suspended in May 2016 after two derailments).
  
 Ali Akbar said, “The government has to pay the construction cost of Rs16 lakh plus interest as per the agreement. The stoppage of the toy train service is another ploy to say before the court that it’s a loss-making unit. The stoppage of the service is to avoid making due payments to us under litigation. In the petition, a CBI inquiry has been sought. Central Railway is representing the case. As the title of the land is not clear, the   has deferred its decision to make it a world heritage site.”
  
 CR’s PRO A K Singh said, “This is an old issue. We cannot comment as the matter is sub judice.”
