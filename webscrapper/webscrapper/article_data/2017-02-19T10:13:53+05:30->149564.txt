KOLHAPUR:   will now be towed away by the city traffic police.

 The city traffic branch has started a new hydraulic   on Saturday to drag away   across the city. The van will tour across the city on an experimental basis and soon the police personnel are planning to add five more vans for tighter scrutiny.
 
 Superintendent of Police, Kolhapur district, M B  , said, “One of the main reasons for traffic jams is the haphazard parking of vehicles across the city. The towing vehicle will be touring across the city to pull to find cars parked in a disordered manner.”
 
 He added, “After studying the impact of this vehicle on the traffic and the experience of the traffic department we will be deploying five more such vehicles that will help in maintaining smooth traffic flow in the city. The tender for these vehicles will be floated after our experiment with this towing van.”
 
 Police inspector in-charge of city of traffic department  , said, “Unlike other towing vans, the hydraulic towing vans will not damage the bumpers or any other parts of the cars. This will help in less damage to the vehicle and fewer quarrels will take place between them. The vehicle owners will have to pay fines between Rs 500 and Rs 700 depending on the violation of the rules.”
