CHANDIGARH: A day after it emerged that the man lodged in   since December 2016 for the alleged rape of a call centre employee was not involved in the incident, police on Wednesday said it will initiate the process of discharging the Sector 52 resident from the case.

 The DNA samples of   did not match with the semen sample collected from the rape survivor. The 21-year-old woman was raped in a forest area in Sector 29 after she had hired an auto from Sector 34 for her home. Family members of Malik said he was falsely implicated in the case. Malik’s sister   said his brother had sold his auto much before the incident. “My brother has not even been involved in a minor brawl case in the area and police arrested him for raping a woman. Police also failed to recover the auto used in the crime. Malik spent more than one year in jail for no fault of his,” his sister said.
 
 Family members said Malik’s entire life has been ruined and he would now be known as a rape accused. “Nothing can compensate his one year behind the bars,” they said.
 
 On the other hand, DSP (east) Satish Kumar said the police had arrested Malik only after the rape survivor had identified him in a test identification parade before a judge. “We now know that Mohammad Irfan, who is the prime accused in the 2017 gang rape case in Sector 53, had raped the call centre employee too. We have also arrested the second accused,” a police official said. The DSP said after the test identification parade of the accused, they would initiate the process of discharging Malik from the case.
