PANAJI: Goa will have to wait a little longer for its first Sindhi school. Director of education GP   said on Wednesday that a trust that intended to open one withdrew its application after it realised it wouldn’t get sufficient students for the 2018-19 academic session. 

  
 
 Six applications for Urdu medium schools also stand withdrawn for the same reason, Bhat said. However, four applications for primary schools in the medium are under consideration of the directorate. 
 
 “Eighty percent of all applications received to open new primary schools have been rejected,” Bhat said. “Only around 15 applications for new Konkani and Marathi schools are being considered.” 
 
 In 2012, the state government relaxed the distance criteria for Konkani and Marathi schools, meaning they could open despite other primary schools in this medium of instruction already operating in the area. However, Bhat said that the applications for many new Konkani and Marathi schools had to now be rejected as they were within one kilometer of existing Konkani and Marathi primary schools, and would eat into their enrolment.
 
 For the academic year 2018-19, he directorate received 61 applications to open new primary schools. Accordingly, Bhat had asked additional district education inspectors to submit feasibility reports to check if the new schools would eat into the numbers in existing schools. The fate of new schools is decided based on these feasibility reports.
 
 Of the applications received to open new primary schools for the academic year 2018-19, 24 applications were from educational institutions and trusts to open Konkani-medium schools, 14 to start Marathi-medium schools, seven to begin Urdu-medium institutions, and one to open a Sindhi-medium school. 
 
 Another 15 institutes and trusts had sought permission to open English-medium schools from June 2018. These applications were rejected outright in view of the state’s medium of instruction policy.
