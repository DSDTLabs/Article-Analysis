PANAJI: Members of a voluntary organisation have demanded the scrapping of the Regional Plan (RP) 2021 and all outline development plans (ODP), and have asked for the preparation of a new RP 2031 in conformity with the people’s participation.

  members alleged that cutting of roads to build expressways, river nationalisation, and implementation of the regional plan are being strategically done to open a gateway for coal transportation from Goa to other states. 
 
 “A coal mine has been purchased by a businessman for Rs 6,000 crores. That mine is estimated to contain about 150 million tonnes of coal. We have filed RTIs which reveal that the government has plans to build a jetty at Baina where this coal will be unloaded and supplied to power and steel plants in Maharashtra and Karnataka  ,” said co-convenor of Goencho Avaaz, Viriato Fernandes.
 
 “We’ve carried out extensive studies of the properties across Goa proposed to be changed to settlement zones, some of which are owned by politicians or their relatives. The names of these politicians with evidence will be disclosed at the Goencho Avaaz awareness meeting,” said co-convenor of the organization, Swapnesh Sherlekar. The awareness meeting will be held on April 27 at 4pm at  ,  .
