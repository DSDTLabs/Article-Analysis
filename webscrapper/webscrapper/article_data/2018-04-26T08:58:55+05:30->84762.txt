MALAPPURAM:  , who were hit by the Centre's decision to end pilgrimage subsidy, got a jolt after   authorities in   issued a directive that an applicant-who had performed haj or   in the past three years--will have to pay an additional amount of SR 2,000 (Rs 35,000). 

 The fresh directive will be a big blow to over 60% of the selected pilgrims in Kerala. Already the cost of haj pilgrimage rose by Rs 20,000 this year after the subsidy was withdrawn. Chairman of state haj committee Thodiyoor Muhammed Kunju Moulavi said that the total pilgrimage cost would increase by Rs 55,000 due to the new directive and stoppage of central subsidy.
 
 "We can figure out affected applicants only after verifying their passports. The decision will affect over 80% of pilgrims from Malabar and over 50% pilgrims from other parts of Kerala," he said, adding that the committee will publish the details of such applicants soon.
 
 In 2017, a pilgrim had to pay Rs 59,871 as airfare. Now, it has increased to Rs 74,450 per person and the airport expense charge increased by Rs 5,000 this year.
 
 The panel had allotted 10,981 seats for the state this year including an additional 3423 seats which remained vacant in other states. 
 
 Already, as many as 1,270 pilgrims, aged over 70 and 1,121 women-who undertake the journey without the assistance of a male 'Mehram-have already been selected.
