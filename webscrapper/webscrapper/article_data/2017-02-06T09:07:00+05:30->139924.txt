While many perceive   to be rather asocial and guarded, truth is, the actress can be quite a laugh riot on her film sets. Don’t believe us? 

 This recent video from the sets of ‘Jagga Jasoos’ that has gone viral online, shows Kat unleashing her fun streak. The actress seems to have taken up the hairstyling duties of her ‘Jagga Jasoos’ director  . In the 5-second video, you can see   gleefully razing off Anurag’s hair while the hapless director playfully pretends to shed a tear or two over the situation he is in. Anurag shared the video on Twitter with the caption reading, “Katrina!! The only thing that will save that haircut now is an invisibility cloak..”
 
 If this video is any indication, looks like the team of ‘Jagga Jasoos’ is having as much off-screen as on screen. ‘Jagga Jasoos’, which stars   in the male lead opposite Katrina, hits the theatres on April 7.
