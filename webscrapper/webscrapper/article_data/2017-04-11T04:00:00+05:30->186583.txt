Rajkot: The Surendranagar health department has launched a probe to verify the claims of parents of some 15 children suffering from thalassaemia that they received blood infected with hepatitis B during blood transfusion at CU Shah Medical College and Hospital in Surendranagar town.  The hospital provides free blood transfusion to thalassaemia patients every week. When contacted, Dr S M Dev, chief district health officer of Surendranagar, said that he has come to know about the allegation of infected blood being used during transfusion. “The health department will verify facts of the case,” he said. “We have initiated a process to verify whether or not the kids were infected due to blood transfusion at the hospital. Only after that can we comment on the case,” he said. Parent of one of the children affected after the blood transfusion said that they used to go regularly to CU Shah Medical College and Hospital in Surendranagar for their seven-year-old daughter Diya.  “Six months ago, my daughter’s condition deteriorated and we went to Rajkot for check-up. The doctors there suspected that she has been infected with hepatitis B virus. Her medical reports are awaited. Last week, some more parents of thalassaemia patients complained about the same issue,” claimed Dignesh, father of Diya, a resident of Adariyana village in Patdi taluka of Surendranagar.
