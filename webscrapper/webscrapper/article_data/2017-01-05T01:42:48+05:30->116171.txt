MUMBAI: State   general secretary   on Wednesday demanded a high-level   into the alleged Rs 20,000-crore  .

 Reacting to the TOI report published on Wednesday, ‘State government clears Rs 20,000 crore cost hike in irrigation projects’, Sawant said it is the responsibility of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to explain the massive cost escalation to citizens. “It’s yet another scam involving a section of senior cabinet members. Fadnavis himself must order a probe,” he added.
 
 Sawant claimed that the Rs 20,000 crore was mobilized for municipal council and nagar panchat polls and the ensuing zilla parishad and municipal corporation elections. “All these funds were utilised for the elections,” he alleged.
 
 Sawant pointed out that a few months ago, the chief minister had declared that 94 tenders for major irrigation projects were cancelled. “We have information that not even a notice for cancellation of the tenders has been served on the erring contractors; in fact, these contractors were continuing work.” 
 
 On demonetisation, Sawant said the state government should initiate criminal proceedings against the   government for ‘misleading’ citizens over depositing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. On November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had declared that after December 30, people can deposit the banned notes in the RBI. But on December 30, the NDA government promulgated an order saying only those who were abroad in November and December will be entitled to deposit the notes. “The NDA government has taken several contradictory decisions after demonetisation. Under such circumstances, the only option is to initiate criminal proceedings against the Centre,” he said.
