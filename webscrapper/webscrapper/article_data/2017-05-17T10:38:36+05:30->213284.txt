BHUBANESWAR: The   (BMC) will start   of the three   from Wednesday. The   cleaning before monsoon is necessary as the   it leading to water logging in many localities during the rains. 

 BMC sources said around Rs 1.52 crore will be spent on the cleaning that will involve restoring the basin, removing waste such as plastic and solid ones. "During cleaning, the workers will also inspect whether there is major blockage on the route," said executive engineer (BMC drainage division) Pradip Duria.
 
 In the first phase, the de-siltation work of drainage channel 5, 7 and 9 will be taken up. From May 29, the work on remaining seven drainage channels will start. The work will be expedited considering that there is forecast of early arrival of monsoon by the MET department. Tender was floated for the three works and contractors who won the bid will take up cleaning work
 
 However, for smaller drains along the roads in different wards will be taken by the BMCs workers. The tertiary drains have been identified for repair in 10 wards. The city has 10 drainage channels that have originated in the western side of the city. The drain water gets deposited in Gangua canal before finally joining the Daya river.
 
 Sources said during heavy rain, these drains take load of storm water and there is flooding. If the sludge and other waste material are removed and flow of water is ensured, then there is less chance of drain water spilling over to residential areas and roads, said Duria, adding it would ensure better flow of rain water to Gangua. The BMC sets to complete the work of the three channels by May-end. 
 
 Last year, the BMC had identified 27 vulnerable points that witness water logging during monsoon. Besides Jharpada and Siddhi Nagar near City Women's college, waterlogging complaints come from Acharya Vihar, Rasulgarh, Laxmisagar, Old Airport road, Jaydev Vihar and several other places.
