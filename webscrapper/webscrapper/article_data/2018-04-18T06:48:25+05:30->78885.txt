BENGALURU: The education department has withdrawn its controversial order on the norm to determine minority status of schools in the state. The order mandated that 25% of the total number of students admitted to a school in an academic year should belong to a religious or linguistic minority community for a school to secure minority status tag. 

 The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, that had opposed the notification, calling it "unconstitutional", welcomed Monday's development, but confusion still prevailed on whether an order by the previous government, mandating 75% reservation, would now be in force. Moreover, The   State Minorities Educational Institutions Managements' Federation has moved the high court against the order. 
 
 Puttanna, MLC and honorary president of the association, revealed the issue has been hanging fire for six years. "When the   was in power, they had made it 75 per cent reservation,"   said. "The present government fixed it at 25 per cent. But it is illogical. A quota like this cannot be implemented because of demography. In each district, the composition of caste and religion of the population is different."
 
 D  , chief secretary of the association, welcomed the government's decision to withdraw the order and urged the government to take a clear stand on the issue keeping orders of the   and guidelines of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) in mind. 
 
  Shashikumar insisted that it is "impossible" to admit 25 per cent of students of the same community to which schools have got minority status.
