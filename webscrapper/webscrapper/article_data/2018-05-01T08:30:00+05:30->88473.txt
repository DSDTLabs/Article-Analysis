Chandigarh: Setting up a sewage treatment plan is the only viable option to save the dying  , the Chandigarh administration told the Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday during the resumed hearing of the case relating to its preservation and beautification.

 The high court had taken suo motu notice of depleting water level of the lake in 2009 and has been monitoring the situation since. 
 
 The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Chandigarh administration to ensure that Sukhna does not dry up this year and there is regular flow of water into it.
 
 Submitting its response, the Chandigarh administration said it had constituted a committee to set up a sewerage plant at Kishangarh and tenders had been invited. The financial bid would start from May 17, it said.
 
 The installation and trial of the plant would take more than nine months subject to examination of the committee of technical heads of the stakeholders, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, the HC was informed.
 
 The UT administration also said the feasibility of putting treated water in the lake was being considered and the final call for pumping this water into Sukhna would be taken after taking the HC into confidence.
 
 The amicus curiae in this matter said there was a need to frame short-term and long-term plans to save Sukhna and that the Chandigarh administration was not following the HC order.
