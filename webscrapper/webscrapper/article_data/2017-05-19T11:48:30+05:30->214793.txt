BENGALURU: For over three hours the fortunes of Kolkata Knight Riders and   sides were at the mercy of the rain gods.

 Hyderabad were a trifle more relaxed of the two teams. If rain had the final say, their passage to Qualifier 2 was clear. They had a point more than their opponents, even a win more than them.
 
 However, the newly-installed Sub-Air technology at the M Chinnaswamy stadium ensured play finally got under way. While the state-of-the-art feature, used to dry the outfield, came in for high praise from all quarters, the pitch, which is now thinner by 6-7 inches, drew mixed reactions. More so after the defending champions were knocked out of the competition.
 
 The ball kept low, not coming on to the bat easily and Hyderabad skipper   was vocal about his disappointment with the pitch. But his Kolkata counterpart Gautam Gambhir, who led his team to a seven-wicket victory with his 19-ball 32, pointed out, "It was a much better wicket than the one we played RCB on. It was coming onto the bat nicely in our innings."
 
 Pitch apart, the weather had a say in Hyderabad's run this season. In their league encounter, the team was robbed off a potential point against a struggling Royal Challengers Bangalore after their contest was washed out without a ball being bowled. On Wednesday, if Warner and his men reckoned they could defend 128 in 20 overs, given their bowling might, rain doused those plans too.
 
 Hyderabad bowling coach   conceded that that the batsmen fell short, but was quick to add that it was the truncated duration of the match that upset their plans.
 
 "Had we played and won (against RCB here), we wouldn't have been playing here, we would have played in Mumbai. Had it rained 20 minutes extra, we would have gone through," rued Murali.
