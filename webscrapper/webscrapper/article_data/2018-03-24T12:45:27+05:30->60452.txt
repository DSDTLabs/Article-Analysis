NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   and   president Amit Shah on Friday asked party MPs to reach out to the people to “expose” the “lies” of the opposition parties which have paralysed Parliament for three weeks over various issues. 

 
 “Use technology optimally and let people know about the reality. The message should reach the common people about the desperate opposition resorting to canards and lies against the government,” HRD minister   quoted the PM as saying at the meeting of BJP parliamentary party. 
 
 “Party leaders should try for instant sharing of information with people by using technology,” Modi said at the three-hour meeting, the first such gathering at the new party office, ministers gave presentations on the development projects including the focus on 115 least developed districts of the country. 
 
 Stressing on building party offices in every district, Modi said BJP operates from offices and not leader’s residence, a swipe at the   party. Modi said that the mandate to the party was not merely for governance but for the holistic uplift of the country. 
 
 He also said the party should not be confined merely to electoral politics but develop direct chord with the people. With the   polls due next year, Shah asked MPs to work to strengthen booth-level organisation in their constituencies, asserting that BJP's ideology and Modi's leadership have been a key reason for its string of electoral successes. 
 
 “All MPs should reach their respective constituencies and tell people through all possible means about the unprecedented deadlock in the parliament,” he said.
