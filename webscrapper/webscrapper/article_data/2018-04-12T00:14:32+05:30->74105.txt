Pune: Afghan soldier Noor Mohammed (20), who lost his left leg below knee in a mine blast in 2015, is all set to get a prosthetic limb at the Indian Army’s Artificial Limb Centre (ALC) here.

 Noor was injured while fighting militants in the Elman-e Uchawnah sector in Afghanistan. As of now, he walks with the help of crutches.
 
 Officials at the ALC said the centre treats foreign nationals who are recommended directly by the Ministry of Defence. “The expenses are incurred by respective countries. In the past, we have treated soldiers from Bangladesh and Nepal by providing them prosthetic limbs,” a former ALC officer said. 
 
 Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, Noor said, “I have been relying on crutches for the last three years as my country doesn’t have facilities like the ALC. It has been a difficult period for me. Fortunately, the Afghan government took up my case with the Indian government in 2017 and I was referred to ALC.” Noor was admitted at the ALC in January this year.
 
 He has been provided all logistical and medical support, required on a daily basis, by the ALC. “I am quite comfortable here as I am not only getting medical support, but also psychological support, which is key to my condition,” Noor added.
 
 Commandant of ALC Brigadier SK Singh said, “Our medical team has studied the Afghan soldier’s case and based on their reports, a limb will be provided to him over the next few weeks. He will also be given an additional limb so that he will not have to be completely dependent on a sole limb.”
 
 The ALC is a premier establishment that provides artificial limb, appliances and rehabilitative care to the soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces. Although, it was raised with a primary objective of meeting the prosthetic and orthotic requirements of disabled personnel of the armed forces, the centre has gradually extended its facilities to the civilians as well since 1951.
