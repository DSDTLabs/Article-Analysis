SURAT: In order to avoid massive wastage of water during Holi and Dhuleti festivals, the   (SMC) has appealed to the residents to celebrate ‘dry Holi’. 

 Official sources said that a campaign on social media and outdoor publicity was started few days ago to spread awareness among the denizens to avoid the wastage of water during Dhuleti festival, thereby preserving huge quantity of water going down the drains. 
 
 According to an estimate, around 300 million litres of water per day (MLD) will go waste during the festival in the city. The city’s population is around 50 lakh and if water wastage is gauged, then each person in the city might use 50 litres of water during the festival. 
 
 On an average, each person in the city uses around 20 litres to 25 litres of water per day for various activities including drinking, bathing and in the toilets. 
 
 According to a   (WHO) estimate, one out of every six persons in the world is not getting water to drink. The world average of water consumption per person is 20 litres in a day. 
 
 Talking with TOI, additional city engineer, K H Khatwani said, “If we are saving 300 MLD water on Dhuleti festival, it means that we are contributing to securing water for around 1.5 crore people from the world’s point of view.” 
 
 Khatwani added, “The Diamond City is bestowed with ample water in Tapi river, which is the city’s lifeline. But, abundant water is no licence to waste it. We are spreading awareness among residents to stop wasting water on Dhuleti and thereby contribute to the welfare of city, state, nation and the world.”
