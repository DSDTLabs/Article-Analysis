JAMMU: Police on Tuesday claimed to have foiled a bovine smuggling attempt from   area in Reasi district and arrested a man, while others managed to flee.

 A police party intercepted a truck during the wee hours at Simbal Choa in Reasi district, a police officer said.
 
 When the truck, which was plying from Reasi towards Katra, was stopped, the driver along with three to four others tried to escape, leaving behind the vehicle, he said.
 
 Police chased them and nabbed one accused identified as Mohammad Sadiq of Kundran in Reasi, he said.
 
 "11 cows and 3 bulls were found brutally stuffed in the truck which was tied with ropes," the officer said.
 
 During interrogation, Sadiq revealed that they were taking the animals for illegally selling in   and had planned to go via   road.
 
 A case has been registered and further investigation into the case is underway, he said. 
 
 On April 21, a 60-year-old man and his daughter-in-law were beaten up by a mob of 100-150 people near his tin hut in Reasi district after they mistook him for a cow smuggler.
 
 A video telecast by a private news channel showed his family begging for mercy while the police, heavily outnumbered, could do little to disperse the mob.
 
 Three days later, eleven people were arrested for allegedly beating up members of the nomadic family.
 
 Four members of the nomadic family were also booked for transporting cattle from Reasi to Inshan in Kishtwar district without taking permission from the Deputy Commissioner, Reasi.
 
 Bovine smuggling within regions and districts in the   division is banned by the state government.
