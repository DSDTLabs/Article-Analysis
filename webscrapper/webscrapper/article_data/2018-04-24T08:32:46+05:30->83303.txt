MEERUT: Relentlessly taunted for being 'fat' by her husband and in-laws, a 27-year-old woman killed herself in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The incident came to light when a video in which the woman mentions her suffering went viral on Sunday. She had posted the clip online on Thursday before taking her life. An FIR was filed on charges of abetment to suicide and dowry harassment against the suspects on Monday afternoon. 

 The woman, identified as  , had married 29-year-old   (who goes by his first name) on February 5 this year in Haryana's Yamuna Nagar district. 
 
 In the video, Aarti says she was constantly picked on for her weight and harassed for dowry by Abhishek, his uncle Dharampal and aunt Kiran Bala. "Soon after the wedding, I was tortured for being overweight. They even forced me to go on a diet and stopped me from visiting my parents' house as I would disclose their misdeeds," says the distraught woman in the video that was recorded on a mobile phone.
 
 "One day I broke down in front of them and they made a video of it, threatening to make it public to prove that I was mentally ill. If I do not go back, people will think that I have done something wrong. But if I return, they will torture me more," said Aarti, before ending the video.
 
 Sudhir Ujjwal, station house officer (SHO) of Nanauta police station, said, "A case has been filed against Abhishek, Dharampal and Kiran Bala under IPC Section 306 (abetment to suicide), Section 498 (a) (cruelty) and relevant sections of the Dowry Prohibition Act."
