Margao: Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao on Friday said that chief minister Manohar Parrikar must take serious cognisance and issue immediate directives to the directorate of civil supplies to take stern action against those involved in pilfering gas from domestic LPG cylinders delivered to the public. It may be recalled that on Thursday, alert Benaulim residents nabbed three individuals red-handed while they were using a pipe to transfer gas from domestic LPG cylinders to the commercial LPG cylinders they were allegedly selling illegally to hotels. However, the fourth accused fled from the site. Alemao, who arrived at the scene, handed them over to the police, who, in turn, handed them over to the civil supplies department for further action.  Alemao told reporters that he had spoken to the director of civil supplies, Mahesh Khorjuenkar, seeking the closure of the gas agency whose workers were caught. He said the director was studying the matter. The Benaulim MLA also flayed the Colva police for their failure to register a complaint of theft.
