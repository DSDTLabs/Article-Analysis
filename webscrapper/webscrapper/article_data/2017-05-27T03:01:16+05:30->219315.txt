NEW DELHI:   will be offering scholarship to meritorious students applying from remote areas, especially the Northeastern states to pursue graduation in the colleges under the varsity.

 All information regarding the terms of the scholarship is expected to be uploaded on the website of the university within the next few days. Manoj Khanna, the convenor of Admission Committee at Delhi University said that the scholarship is aimed at encouraging students from states like Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Ladakh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands to pursue higher education and contribute towards the development of their native place.
 
 “The scholarship will be given to meritorious students from every corner of the country. Every student who benefits this will be able to educate and inspire hundreds like him/her to pursue higher studies,” said Khanna. This move is thus aimed at encouraging more aspirants from smaller cities to pursue their graduation from Delhi University.
 
 The exact amount of the scholarship and the number of students to whom it will be offered, is yet to be finalised by the admissions committee which is undergoing deliberations on the topic currently.
 
 “DU is trying to reach out and help economically weaker students by bringing them at par with everyone. We will determine how many students will be eligible for the scholarship after we receive all the applications. The committee will then select the most deserving students who match the criterion,” added Khanna.
 
 The convener announced the details about the scholarship at the open house. The student can choose to study in any course or college which he/she gets admission to. Although the amount is yet to be determined, it is expected to fund the majority of a student’s course expenses at the varsity.
