BENGALURU: Rattled by the Centre's decision to drop the proposal pertaining to setting up of a PIO (Persons of Indian Origin) university , members of the Indian diaspora have decided to submit a formal representation to the Union government to “continue and expedite“ the project. Secretary general of GOPIO International ( ) A   told TOI: “We were under the impression that the PIO university will take definite shape during PBD-2017. But news about the university project being shelved has not made us happy .“ GOPIO is a non-political and not-for-profit international network engaged in the welfare of PIOs and NRIs (nonresident Indians).   (PBD2017) is being held in Bengaluru from January 7 to 9.
 
 The university for PIOs and NRIs was first mooted during A B Vajpayee's prime ministership, following requests from the Indian diaspora on the need to inject Indianness among their children and provide them better educational oppor tunities. The proposal was one of the most discussed issues pertaining to PIOs NRIs when Vayalar Ravi was Union minister for overseas affairs, from 2006 to 2014. However, the MEA dropped a bombshell on January 2 when joint secretary ( ) Vani Rao said that the proposal to set up the varsity had been formally dropped and was no longer in existence.“
