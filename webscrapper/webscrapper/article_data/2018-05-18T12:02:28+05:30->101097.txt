BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yeddyurappa’s decision to transfer to vantage posts five IPS officers, who had been sidelined by the previous government, has baffled the bureaucracy: one of the officers handpicked by   had raided his residence in a corruption case seven years ago.

 
 The transferred officials and their new postings are: Amar Kumar Pandey (additional director general of police – Intelligence),   (deputy inspector general of police – Intelligence), D   (DCP – Bengaluru Central), S   (DCP - Northeast) and K Annamalai (SP - Ramanagara).
 
 “The first thing that any new CM does is to change the intelligence chiefs by bringing in his trusted men or those from his community. But what is surprising is the transfer of IPS officers Devaraja and Girish,” a source in the bureaucracy said.
 
  
  
 
 Girish was a deputy SP in the  , and part of the team that reached Yeddyurappa’s residence with a search warrant, following a complaint lodged with the Lokayukta in 2011. The subsequent arrest of Yeddyurappa ended his run as CM.
 
 “By bringing Girish back to the city as DCP, Yeddyurappa is driving home two points: One, he does not practice politics of vengeance. Two, he supports honest and efficient officials,” said the source.
 
 Devaraja, who is a Vokkaliga and was DCP ( ), was transferred to Bidar by CM Siddaramaiah, following the suicide of a businessman involved in fraud. Devaraja had kept the underworld under control during his stint in the city. “By getting Devaraja back, Yeddyurappa is sending a message that he is giving equal importance to the dominant Vokkaliga community,” a source said.
 
 Appointing Annamalai to a district dominated by JD(S) state president   is perhaps timed for the byelection due for either Ramanagara or Channapatna, when Kumaraswamy vacates one of the seats.
 
 Pandey and Patil have been chosen to head the intelligence wing, given their proximity to Yeddyurappa and Shobha Karandlaje.
