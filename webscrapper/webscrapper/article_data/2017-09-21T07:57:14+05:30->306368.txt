KOLKATA:   stands on the brink of a personal landmark. He's set to enter the 100-ODI club when he walks out for the toss in the second ODI against India at   on Thursday.

 Smith has grown in leaps and bounds as a cricketer since making his   debut as a leg-spinner in February 2010. “I think I've evolved a lot as a whiteball player,” he said on Wednesday. “I played my first 30-odd games more as a bowler. But I wasn't bowling well and started focusing on batting. I made that switch, which was one of the best decisions I've taken in my career,” Smith confessed.
 
 Smith revealed that he had to adapt and bring in a lot of changes in his game over time. “I've been batting at No. 3 for a while now and had to find the right tempo... whether that means finding the right time to hit a boundary or hitting to fielders in the deep. It's something you learn as you play. It's exciting to be playing my 100th game.”
 
 Looking back, he picked the century against India in the 2015 World Cup semifinal as his most memorable knock.” It was a pretty big game and it was good to get a big score. I think we lost a wicket pretty early. I was able to form a partnership with (Aaron) Finch. I will say that's probably one of better One-day hundreds in a big occasion. That it came at my home ground SCG was also special,” Smith said of his 93-ball 105 which set up Australia's passage to the final.
 
 On Tuesday, former Aussie skipper Michael Clarke has hinted that Smith was under pressure. But Smith thinks otherwise. “I don't think so. Obviously the results haven't been the way we would have liked and that's something we are trying to rectify,” Smith said.
 
 “It was a disappointing start to the series (vs India), but the guys are working hard and it's all about getting out in the middle and getting the job done. We've a game tomorrow (Thursday) to turn things around,” he felt.
