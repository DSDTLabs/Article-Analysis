ALWAR: A 30-year-old woman working as an event organiser in New Delhi alleged on Saturday that she was drugged and gang-raped by five Delhi-based men at a hotel in Bhiwadi,  . The accused reportedly brought the girl on the pretext of an event management assignment. 

 The police detained the five accused on Saturday night after the survivor managed to alert the cops with the help of a friend in Delhi.
 
 The police rescued the girl from the hotel room where she was found grappling with the effects of drugs allegedly given to her by the accused.
 
 Bhiwadi deputy SP Siddhant Sharma said that five youths were detained from the hotel. The suspects have been identified as Vikas Jindal (38), Rakesh (39), Sanjay Garg (32), Vishu (41) and Sandeep (31), all residents of New Delhi.
 
 Sharma said that one of the men had met the survivor during a party at his relative's house in New Delhi where she was tasked with the event management work. "One of the detained persons took her to Bhiwadi on the pretext of an event management assignment. She came here to see the site in order to plan the event," Sharma said.
 
 The survivor arrived in Bhiwadi in the afternoon and checked into a hotel which was booked by the accused. "They spiked her drink with some drugs and took turns to rape her," said a senior police official, adding that around 6 pm, she informed her friend in Delhi about her ordeal after recovering a bit from the influence of drugs.
 
 "The girl informed the local police about the incident and had also contacted the Delhi police," said the official. The girl was taken to a hospital where a medical examination was conducted.
