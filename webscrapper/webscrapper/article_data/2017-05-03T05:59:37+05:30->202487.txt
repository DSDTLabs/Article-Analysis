 The other two professors charged with having beaten up a student will abdicate formal positions till the investigation against them reaches a conclusion. The college administration has also assured that the protesting students won’t be penalized and their answersheets will be examined outside the college to allay any fears of bias. The female students who sat on protest and stay on the college campus will be given security.
