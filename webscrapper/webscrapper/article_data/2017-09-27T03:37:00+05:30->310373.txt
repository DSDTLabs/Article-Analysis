Panaji: Charter operators, who had been anticipating a 25% rise in charter flights for the upcoming season, are unsure now. At the heart of the issue are the changes in slot allotment for charter flights at the Goa International Airport, Dabolim. Charter and tour operators are “extremely unhappy” that this issue has unfolded just as the tourism season is set to start next week. Describing the situation as ‘alarming’, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Savio Messias said that he is continuously in touch with charter operators. The delay in slot allotment, he said, is just a part of a bigger problem, that of tour operators being unhappy with this year’s allotment of slots. “In the past, the slots, which were allotted in accordance with the vessel, remained unchanged. This year, however, they have changed the pattern,” Messais said. He said the least that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) could have done was to intimate them (charter operators) in advance about the proposed changes. “This eleventh hour notice has put the plans of tour operators in jeopardy,” Messias said. “Though we had been anticipating a significant jump in charter tourists this season, this problem, if not sorted out, will have adverse effect on the season,” said Messias. Travel Corporation of India (TCI), chief operating officer, Ernest Dias, too, said that the government will have to sort out this issue at the earliest possible so as to ensure that the charter business will not be negatively affected. TTAG has sought an intervention into the issue by the government. They have also placed a request with the chief minister’s office for a meeting.
