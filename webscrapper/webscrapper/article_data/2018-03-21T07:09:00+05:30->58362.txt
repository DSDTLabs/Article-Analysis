 Pravesh said he was walking towards the bank when a man started snatching the bag. When he resisted, another accused opened fire in the air. On hearing the gunshot, security guard Mangat Singh tried to come out of the car, but the accused fired a shot at him. The bullet hit the car. In the meanwhile, the two turbaned accused fled in   car in which their accomplice was waiting.
 
 Mangat Singh fired at their car, but they sped away. The police reached the spot. ADCP Brar said the collection company employees go to the bank every afternoon, and most of the times Pravesh collected and deposited the money.
 
 He said the police were exploring all angles. It seemed the accused were chasing the employees or had done a proper ground work before executing the crime, he added.
