Therefore, we have decided to organise a debate session for young men. It is high time then men change their perspective towards women. The best way to implement a change is at school and college level. Therefore, we have invited students across the city to participate in the workshop. Pune- based social activist Milind Chavan has been invited to deliver a lecture focusing on gender equality. We are also planning to screen short films on gender quality. Besides, film screenings we will have an open discussion on laws to tackle violence against women.”

It is important for the other section of the society, the men to take part and give the recognition women deserves. We have to make sure that women participate equally in the development of our country.”
