Disgraced   producer   has asked a bankruptcy judge to order the Weinstein Co to turn over his emails and personal files, which he claims will help discredit sexual assault allegations against him. 

  Weinstein is under criminal investigation in Los Angeles, New York, and London. He is also facing numerous lawsuits from former employees and actors who accuse him of harassment and sexual assault. Weinstein has been disputing this issue with the company since October, when he filed suit in  . The company has continued to refuse access to the material. 
 
  According to Weinstein, the company, which fired him on October 8, is intentionally preventing him from defending himself. He also argues that this is counter to the interests of the company and its creditors, as it exposes the Weinstein Co estate to increased civil liability. 
 
  "To put it bluntly, TWC, and its counsel, may be knowingly withholding e-mails that may exonerate Mr Weinstein and, importantly, that would aid in the efficient conclusion of multiple pending criminal investigations and civil litigations, thereby limiting significant potential liability to the Debtors and their estates,"the producer's attorney,  , said. 
 
  If they are able to obtain the emails and turn them over to police, Cousins added, "Mr Weinstein's attorneys are confident that any and all investigations can and will be brought to a favorable conclusion." 
 
  Cousins also said the company has turned over a 'handful' of emails relevant to one case, which were turned over to investigators.
