Mumbai: Young couples celebrating Valentine’s Day at Marine Drive, Churchgate, Juhu Beach and Joggers’ Park in Bandra on Tuesday will be serenaded by college students who will gift them a red rose and urge them to   for the civic election.

 The group, called ‘Vote For Mumbai’, seeks to motivate first-time voters and those who did not exercise their franchise in the 2012 civic polls through their initiative. The group has already uploaded eight inspirational videos on Facebook. Initiated by six mass media students from HR College, the campaign now also has 30 students from Jai Hind, Mithibai, Vivekananda and KC colleges.
 
 “We were shocked to find out that merely 45% of Mumbaikars had cast their ballot during the 2012 civic election,” said Huzaifa Khan, a volunteer. “By selecting the right candidate, we can help the city get better infrastructure and facilities and weed out corrupt people.”
 
 Lishu Singhvi, a mass media student from Jai Hind Collge, said, “We have bought 1,000   for the drive. Our goal is to reach out primarily to first-time voters and the 55% of citizens who did not vote during the previous election. With almost 98% of Mumbai connected digitally, we believe we can reach out to all.” 
 
 Citizens can also pledge to vote by giving a missed call on 8733087330. tnn
