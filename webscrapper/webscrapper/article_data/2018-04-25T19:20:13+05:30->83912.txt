MUMBAI: The Bombay high court in an interim order on Tuesday stopped construction on a sprawling four-and-half acre playground in   east. The Rs 7-crore project for a mini sports complex, which includes a skating rink and concretization of parts of Sambhaji Raje Maidan, a green lung for lakhs of locals, was challenged by former member of legislative assembly (MLA) Shishir Shinde and two local residents,   and Vijay Pawar. 

 A bench of justices Abhay Oka and   sought to know who had given approval for a skating rink.
 
 The civic counsel had produced sanction for the playground. On perusing it, the court expressed displeasure at the manner in which the BMC administration had approved the plan and questioned the authority of an assistant municipal commissioner in sanctioning it. Shinde, who was present at the hearing, was happy with the interim order. Counsel for the petitioners, Balkrishna  , pointed that though the law allows construction on only 10% of a playground, the BMC had permitted construction on more than 25%. The bench sought a reply from the BMC and stayed further construction till the next date, early next month. The playground was set up in the 1990s. In 2002, the BMC laid a musical jogging track around it. Earlier this year, the BMC published its plans to develop around 6,000 metres of the ground for a mini sports complex.
 
 According to the petitioners, the plans involved setting up a football ground, skating rink, and badminton, volleyball and basketball courts. There is also a proposal to lay another jogging track, said the petition.
 
 Joshi termed it a "waste of public funds" and pointed out that a skating rink constructed by BMC at a nearby ground was lying unused. The petition wants the HC to direct BMC to restore the ground to its former status.
