KOLKATA: A letter written by Bengal education minister   to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) - over a curriculum framed for students of pre-school to Class VIII - has sparked a controversy. While a section of school principals are of the opinion that the state has no right to intervene in such matters, others - who submitted a presentation to Chatterjee - said the curriculum has been forced upon them. 

 In his letter, written last week, Chatterjee referred to a section in the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 and pointed out it prohibits the elementary school curriculum to be framed by any academic authority without being cleared by the state government through a notification. While the minister refused to comment, a school education department source said: "The letter has been sent to CISCE just for information. We are not expecting any response." 
 
 On June 9, a delegation of nine school heads met the minister. "We are objecting to an additional fee, which is not only for tests but also for the mandatory teachers' training programme. The programmes will have to be attended by all teachers and the school will be charged for it. We are also objecting to the mandatory training as that might put unnecessary pressure on them," a principal who met Chatterjee said. 
 
 Another school principal, however, took strong objection to this move by the state government and said: "Can the government write a similar letter to the HRD ministry and   and interfere in the same manner? The affiliating board or council has the right to frame the curriculum or take decisions regarding assessment of students and state governments have no authority apart from granting NoCs and inspecting schools from time to time if required and by forming proper constitutional bodies."
