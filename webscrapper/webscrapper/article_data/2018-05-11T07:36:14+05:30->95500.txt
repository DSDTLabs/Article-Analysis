PANAJI: Taking umbrage over   national president Amit Shah’s promise to farmers in Karnataka, that the Mhadei water dispute would be resolved in six months, the Nationalist Congress Party – Goa on Thursday demanded that Shah should explain to his party workers in Goa whether water would be shared with Karnataka or not.

 NCP general secretary   said that Shah must explain whether farmers in Gadag, Hubli and adjoining areas in Karnataka would receive a share of the water from River Mhadei.
 
 “When Shah comes to Goa on May 13, he must clarify his stand and explain what he meant about the Mhadei water dispute being resolved in six months. “When the matter is in court, why is the BJP talking about it during elections?” Barde said.
 
 The party, which has a lone   in Goa’s 40-member assembly, said that villages in Goa’s hinterland continue to struggle with water supply with potable water being supplied just once a day or once in two days.
 
 The NCP also criticized union minister for civil aviation Suresh Prabhu for saying that jobs would be reserved for Goans at the upcoming greenfield international airport at Mopa. 
 
 Barde said the airport is being built by GMR Airports, is a private company and it was likely that the high paying jobs would go to outsiders, not those displaced by the project.
