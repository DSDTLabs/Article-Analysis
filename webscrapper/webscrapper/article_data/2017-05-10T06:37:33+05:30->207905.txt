Mumbai: Two days before the   begins hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the validity of   talaq,   marriages and polygamy, senior cleric Maulana Syed Shahabuddin Salafi Firdausi has denounced triple   and halala, calling them un-Islamic and instruments to oppress women.

 At a press conference on Tuesday activists of Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy (IMSD) hailed Maulana Firdausi’s statements as a support to the petitioners who are asking for scrapping of talaq and halala. IMSD’s convenor Javed Anand read out Maulana Firdausi’s statement: “Instant divorce by uttering talaq thrice is a mockery of Islam and an act of cruelty against the daughters of Islam. Halala is like dacoity on the dignity of Muslim women and an assault on their honour and self-esteem.” 
 
 Triple talaq is instant divorce while halala is a process where a divorced woman has to marry another man and consummate the marriage if she wants to remarry her first husband. “This is nothing but prostitution in the name of Islam,” protested Anand. When asked why he kept quiet on these issues for so long, Maulana Firdausi told TOI: “I have been speaking to leading clerics in the country for quite some time. While many of them privately agree that triple talaq and halala should be banned but are afraid to say so publicly for fear of losing funds.” 
 
 Islamic scholar-activist Qutub Jahan Kidwai, while supporting the ban on triple talaq, said, the issue should not be politicized. “The BJP wants to appear as a champion of Muslim women’s rights. Muslims activists have fought for reforms within the community for over four decades and political parties should not communalise an essentially gender issue.” She added that triple talaq and halala are not divine injunctions and just part of customs being perpetuated by a patriarchal society. “We must follow the Quranic way of divorce and not a practice which is unilateral and anti-women,” she added.
