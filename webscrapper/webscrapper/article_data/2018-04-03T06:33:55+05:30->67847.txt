KOLKATA: Clashes broke out across the districts on Monday, the first day of filing nominations for Bengal's rural polls, as a pointer to the shape of things to come throughout the week till the last day of filing nominations on April 9. 

 Opposition parties  ,   and the Left alleged that   toughs thronged the   offices and beat up opponents when they went to collect nomination papers or submit them in Birbhum, East Midnapore, Hooghly and Cooch Behar. In  's Sainthia, there was violence as a fallout of a Trinamool factional feud.
 
 Tension had been building up in Birbhum's Labhpur since Sunday night, when Trinamool supporters allegedly laid siege on a local BJP party office, leaving five injured. On Monday, BJP leaders complained that their candidates were driven out of the Ahmedpur block office in Sainthia when they went to file their nomination papers. BJP leaders alleged that Sandip Agarwal, their candidate for Dubrajpur panchayat samiti and his supporters, were locked up in a room in the BDO office and driven out at gunpoint. Trinamool toughs also allegedly barracked BJP men when they reached Illambazar block office to collect nomination papers. Hasan's Congress MLA Milton   alleged that the ruling party was not allowing any opposition candidates from filing nominations in two blocks in his constituency. 
 
 At East Midnapore's Sutahata, a large number of assembled Trinamool workers and civic volunteers attacked BJP Tamluk president Pradip Das. "Such attacks by the ruling party are taking under the police's nose," Das said.
 
 The attacks come days after Trinamool Midnapore strongman and state minister Subhendu Adhikari declared that panchayats under Haldia Development Authority, in which opposition parties draw a blank in the polls, would be given preferential treatment.
