NEW DELHI: BJP on Friday attacked AAP for its two years of “misrule” in the capital. It also presented a report card of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s government and listed the areas that AAP has ignored despite its electoral promise during assembly polls in 2015.

 Delhi BJP chief   said that BJP has done a reality check and the information sourced through RTI has revealed that the government has not fulfilled any of its promises. 
 
 AAP had promised better healthcare, education, basic amenities to the jhuggi dwellers, regularisation of unauthorised colonies, Wi-Fi facility, free water and power, etc. “Our check revealed that pace of development has been slow,” he added.
 
 BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said, “The CM talks about prohibition in other states, but his government has been issuing new licences for wine shops in Delhi and also allowing new bars and pubs.”
