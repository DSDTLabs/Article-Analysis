Akshay   will be seen essaying the role of Saif Ali Khan’s brother in the upcoming black comedy, 'Kaalakaandi'. Ask him if he was apprehensive about doing a film which wasn’t the regular Hindi masala flick and the actor quips, “Most of my films haven’t been the typical commercial masala fare. If I were afraid of being typecast, I wouldn’t have been part of films like 'Pizza' (2014), 'Laal Rang' (2016) and 'Gurgaon' (2017). My choices haven’t been conventional as far as my films are concerned. Also, I prefer doing these kinds of movies because the roles are meatier. My goal, right from the beginning of my career, has been to be a good actor. So, I wasn’t concentrating on what would give me more exposure, but the roles that will make me a better artiste.”

 ' ' has Akshay mouthing cuss words, but he says that he felt no discomfort during the shoot. “I didn’t feel any discomfort mouthing cuss words. Unfortunately, I do it in my daily life as well, much to my wife’s dismay (laughs). I think it’s a great way to express what you are feeling.”
