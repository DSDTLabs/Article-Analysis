MUMBAI: Ten teachers, including the principal and two section heads, recently quit the international school caught in a   against its trustee. Parents claimed that several students too have sought leaving certificates for the next academic year. 

 The school claims only five teachers are leaving. In an  , the other trustee has cited various reasons like health, relocation, etc. The principal quit to avoid a long commute after an accident, it said. 
 
  In an email response to TOI, the school said, "Three teachers are shifting roles into part-time work. Two are relocating. Effectively, it's only five teachers (who are leaving). That's a 6% attrition this year, which is very low versus the average. It's malicious to connect it with recent unfortunate events." 
 
 Commenting on students leaving, the school said, "We do have students being pulled out every year... a few people (may) decide to pull out their children due to the on-going   but we have waiting lists of parents who want to have their children admitted..."
 
 The Bombay HC last week cancelled the bail granted to the trustee accused of   a three-year-old student. 
 
 Some parents believe stakeholders are losing trust in the institution. "Many are unsure the school will come through this turmoil. They feel it has made too many mistakes in handling the issue and can't risk the future of their kids, especially since so many teachers are leaving," said a parent.
 
 Another group is standing by the school. "In my 15 years as a parent, I have seen teachers coming and going every year... It is part of the normal cycle of events,"said a parent.
