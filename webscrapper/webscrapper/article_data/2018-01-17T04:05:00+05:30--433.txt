Vadodara: Investigations by the detection of crime branch (DCB) into the half-a-dozen ATM break-ins in the city on January14 have revealed that a gang from Jalgaon in Maharashtra may be behind it. The team of cops investigating the case is in touch with the Jalgaon police where similar thefts had occurred a couple of days before Uttarayan. 

 DCB sleuths also found the car used by thieves late on Tuesday night near RTO in Darjipura. The car had registration plate of Panchmahal.
 
 “The vehicle that was used by the burglars while moving from one ATM to another in the city was stolen from Bhusawal in Jalgaon district of Maharashtra. Three incidents of ATM thefts had happened in Bhusawal on January 13. It is possible that the gang is from Jalgaon,” said Dharamraj Chudasama, DCB police inspector.
 
 The gang of five thieves had used gas cutters to break the ATMs of the government-run and private banks in Tarsali, Manjalpur, Ajwa Road, Makarpura and near Vadsar bridge on Sunday night. They broke open six ATMs in the city’s peripheral areas within few hours and stole Rs 14.94 lakh cash from five. 
 
 The thieves also seem to have deliberately targeted the ATMs in areas on the city’s periphery so that they can escape easily. It is suspected that they fled from the National Highway 8 which is directly connected to the approach roads to the city. The gang took advantage of the fact that most of the police force was deployed in the old city areas to ensure security during Uttarayan.
