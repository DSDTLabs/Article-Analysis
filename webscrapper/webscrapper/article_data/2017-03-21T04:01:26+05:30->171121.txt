NEW DELHI:   is all set to intensify its outreach programme ahead of the municipal elections. For that, it’s going to use technology to amplify chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s message of the broom cleaning out the city’s garbage. 

 For this, the party is going to run Kejriwal’s pre-recorded video message through projection screens all over the capital. Already, 500 projectors have been assigned—two per ward—and each candidate given the job of holding three shows of this video daily in a ward, preferably at busy places or wherever the people are willing to offer space. This way, the party hopes to hold 1,500 shows daily for 1.5 lakh people. In April, AAP might come out with another video to reinforce the message. 
 
 This outreach programme would run parallel to the door-to-door campaign where pamphlets containing the same message would be distributed. The AAP convenor has raised concerns about the working of the corporations while highlighting the achievements of the Delhi government. He has also pledged to weed out corruption should AAP be voted to power. AAP has already declared 260 candidates for the polls; the remaining 12 names are expected to be finalised soon. 
 
 On March 17, Kejriwal had met and instructed all Delhi MLAs to campaign with the councillor-hopefuls. On Sunday, they carried out the instructions in a “mass contact” programme with the promise of repeating it every evening. 
 
 Earlier on Saturday, Kejriwal had reiterated his vision of making Delhi as clean a city as Washington DC, London and Tokyo in a video message.
