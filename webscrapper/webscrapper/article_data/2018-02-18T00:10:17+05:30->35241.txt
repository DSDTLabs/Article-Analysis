Pune: Guardian minister   on Saturday said adequate funds were being made available for ongoing and proposed developmental works in the city. “Not one project will be delayed because of lack of funds,” he added.

 Bapat was speaking after inaugurating the flyover at Karvenagar. Local leaders of the NCP were conspicuous by their absence. Bapat said the flyover work was delayed because of various reasons and that it was speeded up in the last few days. He claimed that BJP-led state government has given a push to crucial projects in the city.
 
 “Work on metro is moving fast. The government is working on the ring road project. The crucial 24x7 water supply project was cleared recently. More projects are expected to be commissioned soon. The government will resolve the technical issues pertaining to the Shiv Srushti project. People will witness a good change in terms of availability of infrastructure in the city,” he said.
