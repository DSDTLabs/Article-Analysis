NEW DELHI: All   entering the arrival area of Indira Gandhi International Airport's domestic terminal (T1C) will have to pay a one-time fee of Rs 150 with immediate effect.

 Cops will tow away such vehicles or clamp their tyres if they exceed the time limit of eight minutes allowed at the T1C forecourt.
 
 The move is to curb severe vehicular congestion at the entry of the terminal and to tackle the menace of touts offering rides to people on their way back to the city, Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), which operates the airport, said on Wednesday, adding that the fee is not a parking charge, but a deterrence for unauthorized parking.

 "The airport has sufficient and convenient parking facility and we encourage drivers to use it," DIAL said, adding that many airports across India and elsewhere charge entry similar entry fees for commercial vehicles.
 
 "We have been witnessing severe traffic congestion at T1C because of unauthorized parking and long waiting time of commercial vehicles," the DIAL said. This is a cause of serious inconvenience to passengers as well as a law and order issue, it said, adding that touting has also increased at the terminal forecourt as a result.
