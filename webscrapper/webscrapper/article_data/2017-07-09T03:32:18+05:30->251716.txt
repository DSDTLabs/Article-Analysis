NEW DELHI: As much as Rs 110 crore of the Rs 610 crore of unaccounted money seized in raids during   was in new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes, indicating misuse of windows offered by the government to change old currency. 

 The new currency seized by police and income tax officials was partly generated through routes such as petrol pumps, railway and airline ticketing and toll plazas where denotified notes were accepted and also the handiwork of a section of crooked bank officials who exchanged notes illegally. 
 
  The figures are part of the arguments made by the Centre in the   in explaining its reluctance in offering a fresh window for exchange of old notes. The exemptions offered, it has said, have been abused and so might any new windows. The   has suggested that a genuine case where a person for circumstances out of his control was unable to change old currency should be given an opportunity to argue his case. The view in the Centre is even a deserving case can be exploited to change illegal money. 
 
  The Centre has argued that the experience of demonetisation did not support the case for a fresh window and also said that ordinance issued to shut down all exchange or deposit of notes after December, 2016 was legally valid. It has said the language of the earlier notification did not mean the government was bound to provide a window beyond the end of the year. 
 
  The seizure of as much as Rs 110 crore of new notes in demonetisation between November 9, 2016 to December 30, 2016 was a good indicator of how the exchange mechanisms were manipulated. The exchange or use of notes was different from the facility to deposit old notes in bank accounts. The 1,100 raids during demonetisation yielded Rs 5,400 crore of undisclosed income and 400 cases are being investigated by the   and Enforcement Directorate.
