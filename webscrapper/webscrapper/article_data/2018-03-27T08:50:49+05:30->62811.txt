CHENNAI: Close to eight years after booking former   chairman   and six others in a case relating to misappropriation of funds to the tune of 468 crore, the CB-CID, Tamil Nadu, has recommended to the director general of police that the case be transferred to the CBI for further investigation. 

 Earlier last year, the DGP transferred the case from the   of the city police to the CB-CID. Subsequently, the case was transferred from the CB-CID to the Mumbai police but it was transferred back as the Mumbai police claimed the misappropriation had not happened in their jurisdiction.
 
 The   (BCCI) had lodged a complaint against Modi and others in October 2010, accusing them of indulging in criminal conspiracy, cheating and falsification of accounts. 
 
 The allegation was that funds amounting to 468 crore were misappropriated during the conduct of the IPL. 
 
 Modi, who left the country for the UK even before the registration of the FIR, and six others were named as accused in the case. The CCB which first investigated the case sent several summons to Modi. He, however, failed to turn up for inquiry before the investigation officer.
