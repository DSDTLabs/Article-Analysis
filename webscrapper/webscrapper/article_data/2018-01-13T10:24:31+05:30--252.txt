TRICHY: Indian Union Muslim League ( ) has resolved to oppose the proposed Act against triple talaq at any cost, here on Friday.

 “The effort of the central government to pass the bill against triple talaq is unnecessary. It looks as if they are threatening and repressing the Muslims in India. Around 4.80 crore people registered their opposition against the proposed Act. It shows the autocratic manner of the union government to go ahead with their plan, without respecting the opposition and consulting anyone,” said IUML national president KM Kader   at a press conference on the sidelines of the national level functionaries’ consultation meeting of the women’s wing of the party in   on Friday.
 
 Kader Mohideen went on to say that they would be ready for any sacrifice and will vehemently oppose the Act which was aimed at punishing Muslim men. “The entire Muslim community will unanimously oppose the move and is ready to make any sacrifice, if the central government refuses to withdraw from their effort to pass the bill,” he said.
 
 Kader Mohideen scoffed at the state government for not resolving issues concerning the TNSTC employees. “The court has to intervene and provide solutions to every problem, which should actually be dealt with by the government. It would be a great pain, if the present government continues to exist.” He also batted for lyricist   for his controversial comments on the Hindu goddess Andal. “Vairamuthu quoted a remark from a research. He did not express his own views. So, it is wrong to stage protest against him,” said Kader.
