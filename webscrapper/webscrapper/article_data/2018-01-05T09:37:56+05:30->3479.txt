CAPE TOWN: The Newlands is home to  . They call him 'Pro' here. Consistency is his middle name.

 As India get ready to tackle the South African attack, it is the 'Pro' factor alone that stands taller then anything else in their way to establishing a series win here. On his day, and there've been many such to his credit, Philander can be the most dangerous bowler of the lot.
 
 Philander will be part of South Africa's attack starting on Friday.   and   with the new ball, followed by 'Pro' at first change. With   to round it off - if Steyn doesn't make the XI -   is confident it'll be enough to handle India. Yet, the skipper was wary of making a statement that may come back to bite him in any form. "You don't want excessive seam movement because that brings both attacks into the game," says du Plessis.
 
 He knows that this one time, India are travelling with their share of 'pros' too - a likely three-pronged attack in Shami, Bhuvneshwar and  .
 
 Instead, du Plessis preferred to harp on the pace and bounce, more a quality that Morkel and Rabada bring to the side than Philander. The skipper knows well that if South Africa look to gain an edge on Philander's strengths - through seam movement alongside quality pace - they'll be potentially looking at a similar prospect against the Indian attack too. "On a wicket that has some pace and bounce, we can exploit their batting line," he said.
 
 It's clear du Plessis is in a quandary of sorts. And the pace attack alone isn't what he's thinking about. "We want to try and eliminate spin as much as possible," he says.
