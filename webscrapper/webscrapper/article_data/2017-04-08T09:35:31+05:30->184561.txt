JAIPUR: The   of   between   Bypass and Gujjar Ki Thadi hangs in balance as the   (JDA) seems in no mood to demolish the structures falling on the route. 

 The JDA proposed to construct city’s first 12-lane road between this 9-km stretch after chief minister   laid the foundation stone. However, delay in widening continues as JDA has failed to remove nearly 400 shops on the route due to political pressure. 
 
 The project cost is Rs 80 crore and JDA has almost spent Rs 50 crore. But, there is no respite from the traffic jam as road is not widened. 
 
 In a recent meeting chaired by the urban development and housing (UDH) minister, Srichand Kriplani, city MLAs also urged not to demolish shops in large number before the election. “ Nearly 70 percent work has been completed. The road between Gopalpura and Ajmer road has widened upto 10 lanes. Engineering wing has written letter several times to carry out drive and demolish the construction to complete pending work. But, administration seems on back-foot.”said an official source.
 
 These shops fall between Gopalpura Bypass and Triveni Nagar flyover, which is a 600 meter stretch. An official sources said , the notices have been issued to all the shopkeepers. As per initial plan, the development authority had proposed to carry out the demolition in phases. However, nothing has been done so far. “Initially, structures between Gopalpura and   was proposed to demolished in the first phase. Nearly 75 structures falls in the area. However, JDA attempts in past remained futile. The drive was expected to start from the Gopalpura end as the road to narrow,” said a source
