NEW DELHI: The UP government’s policy of zero tolerance to cheating in the ongoing state board exams seems to have paid off, deterring lakhs of students who hoped to sail through via different means of cheating. 

 TOI spoke to some of these students. Class X student Nirmal Kumar of   said, “A coaching centre... had promised me 100% success by helping me cheat. But since CCTV cameras were set up at all the exam centres, the coaching centre operators backed out and I decided to skip the exams. I hope things aren’t this strict next year.” Mohd Shoaib of  , also a Class X student, added, “I took the first exam, but found it to be very difficult. The exams this time are relatively harder and there was no way I could have cheated. I have decided to drop out this year, and work hard for the exams next year.” 
 
 A student of Class XII from Khair, Amit Chaudhary, told TOI, “School teachers had taken money to help us clear the exams but later backed out.” He alleged the teachers didn’t teach the entire year but kept assuring students of help to pass the exams. 
 
 According to figures given by   officials, over 10 lakh students skipped the state board exams in the first five days.
