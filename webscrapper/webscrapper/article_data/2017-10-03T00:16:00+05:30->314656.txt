Chandigarh: With the online-appointment system launched for getting a driving licence and vehicle registration in Chandigarh evoking positive response, city residents are demanding an increase in number of slots that can be booked using the facility.

 The UT Registering and Authority (RLA) introduced the system on July 12, with an aim to spare residents of the ordeal of running from pillar to post to avail services at  . A total of 24 slots – from 9am to 4pm — are available in a day. Since the launch of the service, all slots have been booked each day. Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh chairperson Baljinder Singh Bittu said the number of slots needs to be increased, so that more people could avail the facility. “At present, only a handful people are able to avail the benefit,” said Bittu.
 
 Two express counters have been set up for residents for online appointments. An applicant can visit the RLA’s website, www.chdtransport.gov.in, to book an online appointment. The service is available only for the Sector 17 main office, while the service is yet to be introduced for the RLA offices in Sector 43 and Industrial Area.

 No HSRP in sight
 
 Despite shortlisting a firm for affixing high-security registration plates (HSRP), the RLA is yet to restart them. The contract of the previous firm had expired in July last year. Thereafter, the department has floated tenders thrice, but only one firm has come forward, which quoted “very high” rates. UT administration introduced HSRP in 2013. In case of new vehicles, HSRP is affixed at the time of registration itself. However, in case of old vehicles, affixation of HSRP is done one series at a time. To apply for HSRP, one has to submit an application on plain paper mentioning the details of the vehicle.
