LUCKNOW: Extending support to SP-backed RLD candidate   Hasan in the Kairana bypoll,   displayed its inclination to set up an anti-BJP front ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. After dismal performances in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls, Congress decided not to hit the hustings in Kairana and Noorpur. 

 
 "By not fielding candidates, Congress made it clear that like SP, BSP and RLD, we too are against divisive forces. In fact, we want to see a repeat of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur debacles for  ," Congress state vice-president   told TOI.
 
 Earlier, UP Congress chief   had said his party would do anything to defeat BJP in Kairana. On whether Congress would campaign for the joint candidate, Masood said, "We want a Gorakhpur-Phulpur re-run, but whether Congress will campaign for Tabassum is yet to be decided by the party. I will follow the party line and directions." Congress support will mean much for Tabassum's prospects, considering the vital role of Muslim voters in the parliamentary constituency. "There are over five lakh Muslim voters in Kairana. Two lakh Dalits and an equal number of Jats form the next big vote block. Also, there are one lakh Gujjars," said a senior Congress leader.
 
 Congress claims to have a base of at least 2.5 lakh voters in Kairana in a total electorate of 16 lakh. In the 2014 polls, it had left the seat for RLD, but in the 2017 assembly elections it secured a respectable position.
