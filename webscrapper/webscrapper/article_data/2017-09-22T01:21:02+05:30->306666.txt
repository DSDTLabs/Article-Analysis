Mumbai: The Jewish community gathered in strength to celebrate its   festival of Rosh Hashanah at synagogues in Mumbai and Thane on Thursday. The congregation lit candles and sang hymns after which the rabbi blew the ‘shofar’ or deer horn 101 times to signal the turn of the calendar.

 Keneseth Eliyahoo synagogue in Kala Ghoda, Gate of Mercy in Masjid area, Magen David in Byculla, and to some extent Chabad House in Colaba, host the annual ceremony.
 
 Simon Samson Dighodkar, managing trustee of the Beth El Synagogue in Panvel, said, “The new year greeting is ‘Shanah tovah’. The festival will culminate with the fast of Yom Kippur Sunday when Jews atone for their sins and revere the memory of departed souls.”
