HYDERABAD: Appearing to target some politicians who recently joined the TRS, home minister Nayani Narsimha Reddy said that some leaders who had not participated in the   movement have become MLAs, MPs and even ministers in the   cabinet. 

 In harsh remarks during the unveiling of the calendar of the 1969 Telangana State Martyrs' Association on Thursday, Nayani appeared to target leaders from the TDP and   who are now in the ruling party with some of them holding ministerial posts.
 
 The 70-plus Nayani, who participated in the Telangana movement, said that TDP leaders were inducted into the pink party to root out the party headed by Chandrababu Naidu from Telangana. 
 
 On Friday, TRS MLA from Mahbubnagar V Srinivas   supported the comments made by Nayani Narsimha Reddy. At a function in Bhongir district, Goud said KCR might have taken the decision to allow entry to some TDP leaders solely keeping in mind the interests of Telangana.
 
 "Whatever KCR does, it will be in the interest of Telangana. Some forces tried to destabilise the TRS government soon after the formation of the state. To protect the state from such elements, KCR inducted some opposition leaders into the TRS," Srinivas Goud said.
