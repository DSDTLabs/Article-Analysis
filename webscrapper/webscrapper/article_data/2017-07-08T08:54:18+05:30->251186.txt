CHENNAI: Deputy speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman questioned   as to why they did not go for an appeal in the murder case of former minister for highways department T Kiruttinan in the DMK government after all the accused in the case, including DMK chief M Karunanidhi’s son M K Alagiri, was acquitted.

 T Kiruttinan was hacked to death near his residence in Madurai on 20 May 2003, while returning from an early morning walk. The next day, police arrested Alagiri on charges of conspiracy in the murder due to intra-party rivalry. Among the other accused are P M Mannan (who later became the Deputy Mayor of Madurai city), Essar Gobi, I Mubaraq Manthiri (sitting councillor of Madurai Corporation) and V Sivakumar alias ‘Karate’ Siva. After the DMK came to power in Tamil Nadu in 2006, the case was transferred to Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh after the AIADMK sought the Supreme Court’s intervention.
 
 The AIADMK contended that justice might not be done and fair play could be denied if the trial of the case was conducted in a court in Tamil Nadu, as Alagiri’s father, Karunanidhi, was then the chief minister and sought the transfer of case to some other state.
 
 Cooperative minister Sellur K Raju intervened and said DMK members who took keen interest in going for an appeal in former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's case in Bengaluru was not bothered about their own minister's case.
 
 Replying to him, DMK former minister and senior leader S Duraimurugan said the case was declared not fit for appeal.
