Less than a week after the cardiac catheterisation lab (Cath Lab) facility was commissioned at the Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital (TVMCH) as many as 24 patients with cardiac ailments have benefited from the facility. The lab, established at Rs 3.16 crore was inaugurated by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami through video conferencing on February 20.

 After trials, it was commissioned on April 6 and till April 12 it helped save the lives of 24 people. Speaking to reporters here on Friday, TVMCH dean S M Kannan said the number of people who were benefited by the facility to detect and treat blocks includes 16 who had undergone coronary angiogram while angioplasty and stenting was performed on eight patients.
 
 The dean said that procedures such as coronary angiogram, coronary angioplasty, pacemaker insertion, closure of congenital heart defects with balloon valvuloplasty and other invasive procedures can be done at the cath lab.
 
 Kannan said that for the first time among government hospitals in Tamil Nadu, TVMCH is equipped with ‘live dose monitoring’ facility. The dean claimed that this state-of-the-art technology is available in very few hospitals across the country. 
 
 The facility has come as a boon for people with heart ailments from financially backward sections in Tirunelveli region, who had to travel to the government medical college hospital in Madurai or borrowing at least more than Rs 3 lakh for getting treated in private hospitals, in case of emergency.
