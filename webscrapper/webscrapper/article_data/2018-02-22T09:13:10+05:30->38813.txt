The   police will be asked to take a re-look at 2015 prostitution case involving a   actress. “We will ask the department to inquire the case properly,” said   minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar who was appointed as the leader of the House owing to ill health of the chief minister  .

 Dhavalikar offered the assurance after Congress MLA Nilkanth   during ‘Question hour’ on the basis of documentary evidence, said the case was being summarily closed by police due to “lack of evidence” even though the main witness during the raid at a five-star hotel here was a policeman playing a decoy customer.
 
 "When police raided it with their own decoy, how can the case be A-Summary (police department's case closure procedure for lack of evidence). The case was filed with a police personnel as a key witness," Halarnkar said, quoting police records.
 
 The raid on a five-star resort in 2015 and the subsequent rescue of a popular actress from a prostitution racket had hit the headlines, with police claiming to have cracked a major prostitution racket.
 
 The actress was later shifted to a government-run women's home, before being released to her kin's custody.
