Chennai: Upto 30 Indian startups stand the chance to offer solutions to complex issues identified by the Guizhou province in China. Considered to be the data analytics hub of the country, the province intends to have 2 million servers by 2020 and is going all out to invite startups across the world. The program is being facilitated as part of an memorandum of understanding entered into by industry lobby Nasscom, Guizhou International Investment Corporation (GIIC) and HTI, both Chinese companies.

 “For the past two years, we have been building a roadmap to facilitate close cooperation between Indian and Chinese startups. Projects have been identified in the area of Internet of Things and analytics which Indian startups can choose from,” said Gagan Sabharwal, director, global trade development, Nasscom.
 
 Representatives from Guizhou said government data would be opened up in multiple areas including pollution, transport etc to these startups. Consortiums will be formed to address each of these projects which are expected to take 9 -12 months time to complete. The program is designed in a way that every Indian company will have 4-5 Chinese startups to choose from as partners and vice versa. 
 
 “These projects can be too big for one company to handle and can have different issues that need attention. A startup can identify which area they can address and apply for that, for example: data mining,” said Akshay Sasikumar, regional head, Nasscom 10,000 Start-ups “They have been building Guizhou as the data analytics hub. While they have the hardware or the means to build it, software needs to be built in collaboration. They are reaching out to multiple countries and India is a preferred nation due to its proximity,” said Sasikumar.
