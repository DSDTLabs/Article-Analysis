PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The BJP is banking on the high poll percentage in the areas dominated by three of its leaders-- Chinchwad MLA Laxman Jagtap, Bhosari   and former mayor Azam Pansare.

 There was high polling in Sangvi, Pimple Gurav and Pimple Nilakh in the Chinchwad assembly constituency, areas of the Bhosari industrial belt, and slum pockets in Nigdi Ota scheme, Anandnagar, and Pimpri. 
 
 Jagtap, now the city unit BJP president, joined the party just before the October 2014 elections, while Mahesh Landge and Azam Pansare joined a few months ago. All three were with the NCP. 
 
 In Wakad, where there are a number of housing societies, the poll percentage was over 77%, while in Sangvi, Pimple Nilakh and Pimple Gurav, the poll percentage was around 65%. 
 
 Jagtap is banking on these areas to gain power. In the Bhosari assembly constituency, areas like Bhosari-Chakrapani Vasahat, Charholi, and Moshi, the poll percentage was over 74%. 
 
 Bhosari MLA Mahesh Landge had put up a Vision 2020 presentation enlisting several development works in the constituency in the presence of chief minister   last November. 
 
 Former mayor Pansare is banking on the high poll percentage in the slum and other areas which was over 64%.
 
 Jagtap said, “The BJP will get 42 seats in Chinchwad assembly constituency due to high voting percentage. I will not be surprised if we get all 52 seats in this constituency.”
 
 However, former NCP mayor Yogesh Behl, who was also the leader of the house, said, ``The NCP has implemented several developmental works in Chinchwad assembly constituency. The work will benefit the party.”
