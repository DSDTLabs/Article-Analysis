HYDERABAD: To meet the   of the   (ORR), the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has announced that it will increase the   from February 15 midnight.   using the ORR will have to pay 50% more than the existing toll tax.

 Cars, vans and other light motor vehicles will have to pay Rs 1.58 per kilometre instead of the current Rs 1.05. Similarly,   and other light commercial vehicles have to pay a toll fee of Rs 2.54 per km instead of Rs 1.69 per km now.
 
 “The toll rates on the Hyderabad ORR are less when compared to Yamuna Expressway and Mumbai-Pune Expressway. They serve the requirements of loan repayment and annuity payments for the loans taken to develop ORR. The state government approved the proposal to increase the toll rates a week ago,” HMDA metropolitan commissioner T Chiranjeevulu said. 
 
 The HMDA official said of the total 158 km of ORR, 156.9 km has been opened for traffic. The only remaining 1.1 km stretch is at Kandlakoya. “The quality and cost of construction of ORR is much more than national highways. Commuters are only being charged for the actual distances they travel. Moreover, the Authority is planning to provide intelligent transport system and toll management system to ensure quick and safe travel,” an HMDA official said.
 
 Sources in the state government said the proposal to increase toll fee came up as the HMDA suffered revenue losses due to demonetization. Following the Centre’s move, the Authority was not able to collect the toll fee for 23 days.
