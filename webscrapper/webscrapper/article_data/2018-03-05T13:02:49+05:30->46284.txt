BENGALURU: Beginning Monday, a heli-taxi service will be kicked off to quicken the trip between the   ( ) and  .

 In an effort to circumvent the traffic, choppers will shuttle passengers between the two destinations, about 50km apart. The copter ride will reduce the travel time to 15 minutes, what would take one to three hours by road. 
 
 The first helicopter is set to take off on Monday morning from Electronics City at 6:30am with five customers having confirmed their seats. 
 
 The service will be available throughout the day and is being operated by Thumby Aviation Private Limited. 
 
 “At present, we have a helipad set up at Electronics City Phase I and another on the land-side at KIA. There will be cab services that will help people shuttle between the terminals and the helipad,” said Govind Nair director of business development at Thumby Aviation. 
 
 At the start of the ride, each customer is subject to a safety briefing, similar to ones on commercial aircraft to ensure all emergency and safety protocol is followed. 
 
 Customers can book a ride on a heli-taxi at around Rs 4,000 per head (inclusive of taxes) using the app Helitaxii. Cab fares are in the range of Rs 1,500-2,000 between the two desinations. 
 
 
 
 
 Bengaluru: The Kempegowda International Airport will renumber its boarding gates from Tuesday in an effort to smoothen the travel for passengers.
 
 “Renumbering boarding gates will be far more intuitive and easy-to-follow sequence. With this we hope to provide an improved experience for both our passengers and airlines,” KIA tweeted.
 
 As part of the process, domestic and international boarding gates will have sequenced numbering; domestic bus boarding gates will have alphanumeric numbering; bus gates at the ground level will have numbers prefixed with the letter G and arrival bus gates will have the letter A preceding their number.
