NAGPUR: Education is wealth for which one should study everything under the sky and make efforts to know oneself and succeed in life, said noted psychologist Surendra Gole, director of Anantvedh, HR Training Consultancy firm, on Friday.

 Knowledge gained through education lasts long as studying merely for clearing examinations does not bode well for excelling in the chosen career, Gole said. He was speaking on ‘Atma no mokshadham jagat hitay ch’ (Manushyachya dhyey prapticha pravas) organized in memory of Padmakar Pandharipande by Professors Colony Mitra Mandal at   hall. 
 
 Gole said that irrespective of age, one should know the strengths and weaknesses to achieve the goals set in life. The aim should be to reach dizzy heights by excelling in whatever work one undertakes, he added.
 
 Giving an example of Lord Ram and Lord Krishna, Gole said, “Though they were essentially the same, we can still find a lot of difference in their personality and character.” 
 
 Lord Ram and Lord Krishna were fully aware of their aim in life and delivered it. In a way, they were the embodiment of excellence. Therefore, people should learn from their life, Gole said. Nobody other than oneself is responsible for his or her acts and thoughts, Gole said, adding, the same formula applies to work. If one worked hard, success will follow. Every career is good. But every career is not good for everybody, he added.
