Bengaluru: A 38-year old ciBengaluru: A 38-year old city-based mechanic lost Rs 1.15 lakh to criminals who created a video clip about a fake game show called ‘Kaun Banega Maha Karodpati’ in which his mobile number had been selected for a Rs 35 lakh prize.

 Ismail Sharif, a resident of Janakiram Layout in Lingararajapuram, east Bengaluru, filed a complaint with the cyber crime police on Thursday.
 
 Police said the crooks called Sharif on January 5 and told him that he had been selected for the Rs 35 lakh prize. Initially, he ignored the call, but he fell for the scam after they sent a video clip on WhatsApp in which his number is shown in front of the show’s alleged host Amitabh Bachchan. They warned him not to show the video to others or else he would lose the prize.
 
 Police said a caller identifying himself as Pratap Singh asked him to deposit Rs 15,000 into a certain bank account. 
 
 Later, Singh asked him to pay Rs 35,000 and more in several instalments. He finally ended up shelling out Rs1.15 lakh.
 
 Sharif realized he had been cheated only when Singh stopped taking his calls. Later, he sent a message to the crooks, asking them to return his money otherwise he would commit suicide. He then approached the cyber crime cell and filed a complaint.
