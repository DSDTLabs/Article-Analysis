LUCKNOW: From   to chief minister of Uttar Pradesh,   seems to have travelled a long way overnight. In his first meeting with cabinet colleagues, the chief minister, terming the meeting as introductory, assured there would be no discrimination among citizens and also directed all   and   within 15 days and to refrain from making any reckless comments. 

 Later, in his first press conference as chief minister, Adityanath Yogi said the state government would completely follow the “sabka saath-sabka vikas” policy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Dedicated to people’s welfare, the state government would work for all communities without any bias, said Yogi, adding that government and administration will be made sensitive and accountable to achieve this end. 
 
 Yogi said the state government would do all needful in taking forward the state on the path of development and added that job recruitment process would be made transparent. He assured people of the state that mandate given by them was meant for development and positive changes would be visible in time to come.
 
 Refusing to take questions from media persons and terming Sunday’s meeting as mere introductory, the chief minister turned cabinet ministers Srikant Sharma and Siddharth Nath Singh to interact with media persons. To the question on waiving farmers’ loan and closure of abattoirs, Siddharth Nath Singh, who has been BJP’s national spokesperson, said decisions would be taken when the first cabinet meeting would be held, date for which would be decided after the chief minister holds discussion with officials.
