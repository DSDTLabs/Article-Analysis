GURUGRAM: Disappointed with the response of the district administration as well as the state government to Hindutva outfits disrupting namaz at several public places on Friday, the Muslim community has decided to hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss their future course of action. Community leaders blamed the administration for not doing enough to deter these outfits. 

 Sube Singh Bohra, former Wazirabad village headman who is at the forefront of the opposition to namaz at open spaces, declared CM   will be solely responsible "if any untoward incident takes place" in the days to come. "The CM and   need to make their stand very clear on this issue and they have to speak up," he told TOI. 
 
 While the CM could not be reached for his reaction, his media adviser Rajiv Jain initially said there was no need for the CM to speak on the matter but later said the CM was busy with his birthday celebration.
 
 Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh appealed to both groups to maintain calm. "I will ask the district administration to find a solution to this as soon as possible," he said.
 
 Jawahar Yadav, CM's close aide, said city mosques have adequate room. "However, in case they need more space, the community can approach the district administration and seek permission to have namaz in public places."
