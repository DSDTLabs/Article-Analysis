NEW DELHI: A 15-month-long study commissioned by the law ministry on trials of   survivors has concluded that the provision under Section 309 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( ) to complete a rape trial within two months of filing of the chargesheet was unrealistic.

 The study said contrary to the provision in Section 309, even the survivor’s deposition was not completed in two months. The average time for deposition of the survivor was eight-and-a-half months, which continued beyond 15 months in some cases.
 
 “Delays occur for multiple reasons, including late receipt of forensic reports and systemic factors like increasing case load that make delay unavoidable,” the report said.
 
 The study emphasised on reforms in the functioning of all agencies that contribute to the trial, as well as a stricter approach to adjournments. “Yet, it is unlikely that an entire trial can be completed in two months,” it said.
 
 The report said amendments made in the CrPC, meant to strengthen rape laws and curtail the time taken for trials, were hardly realistic.
