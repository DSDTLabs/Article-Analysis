HYDERABAD: Irked by the state government's decision to pass the Private University Bill, students organisations that attempted to gherao the Assembly on Wednesday, called for a bandh across all universities in the state on Thursday.

 Cautioning authorities about massive agitations across  , the groups demanded that the government withdraw the bill immediately.
 
 “The government had put in place heavy bandobast to stop students from marching towards Assembly from the  , and took most of us into preventive custody near LB Nagar. We condemn such illegal arrests. To protest against the arrests and passing of the bill , we have called for a bandh in all universities and request students to cooperate with us and join in, in large numbers,” said Ramesh K a members of the Student Federation of India.
 
 Pointing out that passage of the bill was a step towards turning education into a business, they rued it would leave students from economically backward families deprived of quality education.
 
 “Once the government allows private varsities to set up shop in the state, they won’t have any control over fees, donations, entrance tests etc. These institutes will start operating like corporate schools and colleges. Ultimately, students will suffer,” said Sandeep M of the Telangana Vidyarthi Vedika.
 
 “There is a serious threat to staterun institutions because of this bill and they may be forced to shut down. The state should first strengthen these institutes by filling vacant teaching and non-teaching posts and improving the infrastructure,” said Venu M from the  .
 
 At   and JNTU too, many protesting students were picked up and sent to nearby police stations. They were released later in the evening.
