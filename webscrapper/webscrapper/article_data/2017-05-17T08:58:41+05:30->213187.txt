The yoga guru shot for a wild card episode of a celebrity-based reality show
 
  After permeating the country’s collective consciousness with the virtues of Pranayama, yoga guru Ramdev was a curious sight on the sets of the dance-based reality show   on Tuesday (May 16).
  
  He shot for an upcoming episode as a guest judge alongside  , Terence Lewis and Mohit Suri. A source from the sets reveals that there was heavy security on the sets during Ramdev's entry, with guards checking IDs and sniffer dogs doing the rounds. He kicked off the shoot at 5 pm with Terence giving him a lowdown on the contestants and the show's format.
  
  
 
  
  One of the competing couples on the wild card episode was TV actress Aashka Goradia and her firang boyfriend Brent Goble.Ramdev was particularly intrigued by Brent and made him do head stands. He gave yoga lessons to the other contestants too, urging them to keep calm as they fight to the finish.
  
  He then turned his attention towards the judges. While Terence was excited to follow his cues, Half Girlfriend director Mohit tried to escape but was dragged to the floor.So was Sonakshi whom Ramdev mistakenly called Meenakshi.Ramdev also vetoed raunchy Bollywood songs and the lessons were conducted to “Chak de! India.“
