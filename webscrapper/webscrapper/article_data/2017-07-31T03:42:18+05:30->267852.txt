MUMBAI: The family of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi has alleged that he received threat calls, police said on Sunday. Based on a complaint filed by his son, the police have registered a case against an unidentified person.

 The caller claimed to be a member of a religious outfit and made calls to Azmi four to five times over the past few days and threatened to kill him, police said. 
 
 Efforts are in progress to trace him. Azmi, a SP legislator, had waded into the controversy over making singing of Vande Mataram compulsory in educational institutions in the state on the lines of a recent Madras high court ruling. Azmi had said he will not sing Vande Mataram as his religion doesnâ€™t allow it.
