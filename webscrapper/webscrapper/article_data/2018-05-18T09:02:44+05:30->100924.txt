NEW DELHI: For most part of the last decade,   has grown to become a strong supply line for the Indian national team. This season, the tournament has given to the national selectors the next line of wicketkeepers after  .

 
 
 
 When the tournament enters the business end and teams start playing out inconsequential matches, the matches get reduced to an audition for the ambitious and eager generation of Indian cricket. Friday’s match between laggards Delhi Daredevils and second spot-holders Chennai Skipper King is more about picturing the potential transition behind the stumps for India.
 
 
 
  has stood out among of all the performing Indian wicketkeepers so far. When the 20-year-old takes guard for the beleaguered Daredevils with 582 runs in the bag this season, he will face a nearly 37-year-old possibly looking over his shoulder, eager to assert that he can still dominate the international scene.
 
  
  
 Since the 2015 World Cup, the murmurs over Dhoni’s diminishing stroke-making qualities kept getting louder. And thus came the urge, in certain quarters, to find a replacement. This IPL has been different. The test for the likes of Pant, Ishan Kishan, Sanju Samson and to some extent Dinesh Karthik and KL Rahul has got a bit tougher. Dhoni, back in his CSK shirt, has shown glimpses of his famed brute power. Pant’s audacious strokeplay may evoke memories of a young, imperious Dhoni, but Dhoni isn’t finished yet. In this dead fixture on Friday, Pant could scuttle CSK’s attempts to ensure a top-two finish which will give them two shots at making the final.
 
 Form is with Pant. His acquaintance with the Kotla turf and DD’s nothing-to-lose situation set up a fascinating trial for Pant against a team that will be marshalled by Dhoni. The Delhi boy’s belligerence in this IPL has led to some talking about his possible inclusion in the Indian team. But if there is one person who can figure out Pant’s game and choke him with on-field strategies, it is Dhoni.
