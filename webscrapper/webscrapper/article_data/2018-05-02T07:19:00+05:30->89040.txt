NOIDA: A water supply pipe in   burst around 7am on Tuesday, leaving around 25,000 residents high and dry on a scorching May day. It took nine hours to repair the pipe and the supply resumed by 7.30pm.

 While some residents had to manage with water left in the tanks from the previous day, many others had to let go of their daily chores of bathing, cooking, cleaning and other household work.
 
 “Washing, cleaning and sweeping could not be done throughout the day. Most residents went without a bath in this summer, while others could not fill their coolers etc,” said N V Krishnan, a resident of the sector.
 
 By late afternoon, even drinking water had become scarce as RO filters turned dry.
 
 “There was no water from 7am in our sector as the supply pipe burst in Block A of the sector. Earlier, we have made several complaints on the old rusting pipes and the need for their repair. But no action has ever been taken by the Authority,” said R C Gupta, RWA general secretary, Sector 19, adding that a similar problem arose on April 11 when there was no water in the homes from morning till evening.
 
 The repair work of the   began around 10am. “No alternate arrangements of water were made by way of tankers etc. We faced immense problem with limited water which was a leftover from yesterday’s (Monday) storage. Some homes did not even have that and they had to borrow water from neighbours,” said Laxmi Narain, former RWA president, Sector 19.
 
 Atul Kumar, project engineer (Jal) division 4 of   said, “The pipe got burst from the joints due to pressure early morning. Although we began repair work within a couple of hours, it took time to fix the problem due to the long procedure. We resumed supply in the evening,” said Kumar.
