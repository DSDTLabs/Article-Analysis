 HYDERABAD: Task Force police arrested two jewellers for duping a businessman to the tune of ?1.15 crore by promising to sell him a genuine diamond for less than market value, but instead gave him a Moissanite stone worth ?3,500.
 
 Two jewellers — Md Ather Siddique, 52, of   and Md Salman Khan, 39, of RC Puram— ran into losses. The two have been friends for a long time due to their common business interests. Since their businesses were in loss, Ather came up with a plan to sell fake diamonds to businessmen.
 
 
 As they were looking for prospective buyers, Salman contacted  , with whom he worked at   Jewellers between 1996 and 2000 as a sales executive.
 
  
  
 Salman and Ather told Haji that they were willing to sell ?4.5 crore worth diamond for a less price. “They convinced Haji that if he could arrange ?1.2 crore to purchase the diamond, worth ?4.5 crore, he could easily make a profit within a few days by reselling it to other customers,” Hyderabad police commissioner   said.
 
 Ather Siddique then went to market area near Charminar and purchased a fake diamond for ?3,500. After that, the duo called Haji in Nampally on January 18. “They used diamond genuineness testing tools and tricked Haji to believe that it was a real diamond,” the commissioner said.
 
 Believing that the diamond was genuine, Haji borrowed money from lenders and gave ?1.2 crore to them. At the time of purchase, the victim also took assurance from the jewellers that the latter would introduce him to prospective buyers.
 
 Haji tried to sell the ‘diamond’ on his own and realised that it was a Moissanite stone, used as a decorative item on dresses.
 
 The victim then lodged a complaint with the   on Tuesday. Police arrested the two on Wednesday and seized ?1.15 crore and other evidence from their possession.
