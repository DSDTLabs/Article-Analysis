Hubballi: Prime Minister   might have launched the “Make in India” programme, but for   it is nothing new as it started the initiative way back in 1953, said medium and large scale minister   here on Saturday.

 Addressing the gathering at  , Deshpande said, “Make in India was started in Karnataka in 1953 when   started its units here in the state.”
 
 Policies on startup and electric vehicles were first launched in the country by Karnataka, he said. “That (startup policy) is very unique policy. We always involved stakeholders and that is why our policies are unique,” Deshpande said.
 
 He said that a unit of manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles is likely to come up in Dharwad district.
 
 IT, BT and tourism minister   said that Karnataka is always ahead in promoting startups and encouraging budding entrepreneurs. “Karnataka is focusing on building an advanced ecosystem for its citizens to interact with the government for the best possible delivery of governance. This has propelled the state to be probably the biggest IT service exporter in the world. The IT exports of tier-II cities like Hubballi-Dharwad, Mysuru, Mangaluru, Belagavi and Kalaburagi might touch Rs 5,000 crore. It may be less when compared to Benagluru’s Rs 2 lakh crore. But we will continue to give conducive environment to economic activities,” he said.
 
 MP Pralhad Joshi said that there is a need for providing better infrastructure to tier-II cities and the Centre is also rendering its service towards it. “We are also planning to introduce Talgo train between Hubballi and Bengaluru after the doubling of tracks are done. When introduced, people can travel between the cities in just four hours,” he said.
