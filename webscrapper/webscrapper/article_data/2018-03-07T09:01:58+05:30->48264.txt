HYDERABAD: Arch rivals K Chandrasekhar Rao and   may not be loathe to find each other on the same platform in the quest to form an alternative to the BJP and  . Though KCR has not spoken as yet to Naidu on the subject as yet, both the parties, at this stage, have not ruled out the possibility of teaming up.

 Former MP and TDP politburo member Ravula Chandrasekhar   on Tuesday said that the TDP was looking for more clarity from KCR. “We will see how things unfold. The TDP is in no hurry to take decisions because there is a lot of time,”   told TOI. Asked if TDP would like the idea if KCR would be willing to work under Naidu’s leadership, Ravula said that was not the criteria. “One must remember that it was the TDP under NT   and Naidu that all parties, including the BJP and communists, were brought under an umbrella to fight the Congress. The TDP has always been a leader,” he said.
 
 
 Reddy said they would like to adopt a ‘wait and watch’ attitude on any developments on the third front. While some clarity has emerged from the TDP side that it is not loathe to the idea of a third front which KCR is initiating, it may be mentioned here that KCR himself has given indications that the TDP would not be a pariah.
 
 KCR had chosen not to comment on whether TDP would be part of the initiative. With his ‘no comment’, he gave enough indication that he did not consider the TDP as pariah.
