KOLKATA: Parents of Sunil Tanti, a   of   who was killed on the railway tracks on Monday, will meet police and plead for a proper investigation into the events leading to his death. 

 Sunil's father Rajen, a wielding mechanic, said, "The events leading to his death are vague. Sunil was a studious and sharp boy. He wouldn't do anything rash like shooting in front of an approaching train. He left home in the morning saying he had a project to complete in college," Rajen said. "My son was pouring over his books when Guddu ( 's nickname) dragged him out," Sunil's mother Swapna said.
 
 A few meters away, Saisab Dolui's parents Shanti and Soma had reconciled with news of their son's death. Shanti, who works as a private security guard in Sodepur, said, "My son always had a penchant for shooting. In the last few weeks, he was hooked to this video film. His mother often rebuked him for it. Before leaving home for college on Monday he told Soma it was the last day of his shoot. We never thought it would also be the last we ever saw of him. "He was a very helpful boy. He told me that this video they were shooting would help many people overcome their problems. It was important to him."
 
 SRP   said, "We've lodged two cases of unnatural death.   is also probing a separate case. We would like to appeal all to refrain from such dangerous acts."
