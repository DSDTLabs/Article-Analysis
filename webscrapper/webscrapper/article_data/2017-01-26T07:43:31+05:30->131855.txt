SHAHJAHANPUR: In their first joint campaign after announcing the   alliance,   who was sharing the dais with a Congress leader was effusive in his praise for the partnership, calling it a “winning combination” and that there was no doubt it would go on to form the next government with a majority.

 “The cycle (SP symbol) was alone, but now with the help of the hand (Congress symbol), its speed has increased,” said Akhilesh while addressing three public meetings in Nighasan, Dhaurahra and Mitauli tehsils of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Wednesday. He shared the stage for the first time with a Congress leader, Prem Prakash Agarwal, who will contest from Bareilly seat.
 
 Hitting out at the BJP for demonetisation, the UP CM said, “BJP has been teaching yoga to the country for two years but this time, the public will teach ‘Ulta Asana’ to the party in the upcoming assembly elections by voting against them. We felt the country will make progress but these people pushed it back by bringing in demonetisation and statistics prove this. India’s economy will not improve, whatever the new Budget says.”
