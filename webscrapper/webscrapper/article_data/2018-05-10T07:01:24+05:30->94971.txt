BENGALURU: With the weatherman forecasting rain over the next few days, citizens shouldn’t forget to carry their umbrellas when they head to polling booths on Saturday, especially after 2pm, to cast their vote.

 
 The forecast is a relief for many as there will be some respite from the scorching heat and high humidity since last week. The prediction comes in the wake of the Election Commission extending polling hours by an hour on Saturday due to the possible heat threat.
 
 Met department officials said there is a strong possibility of rain over the next two days across all sixteen districts in south-interior Karnataka, including Bengaluru, and a slight possibility of rain on Saturday. These pre-monsoon showers will be anything from light to heavy in nature, and are a common feature in May.
 
 M B Rajegowda, professor of agrometeorology, urged people to come out of their homes and vote before 2pm on Saturday if they want to avoid the rain. “Since this is summer season, we can expect rainfall anytime after 2pm on most days in south interior and central Karnataka regions,” he added.
 
 However, predictions for coastal and north Karnataka remain the same — the usual hot and sunny weather. Over 5 crore people are expected to turn up on Saturday to exercise their franchise in the assembly elections.
