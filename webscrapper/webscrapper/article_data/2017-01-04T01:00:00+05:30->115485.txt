 is all set to bring out the craziness of   celebrations in  , the first song from his upcoming film  . Joining him in celebrating the festival of colours is  . The high-energy number, composed by Manj Musik and co-written by him and singer Raftaar, releases today. 

 Director   says, “Go Pagal comes at a very crucial juncture in the film. It has been shot in a Lucknow court.” 
 
 Choreographed by Bosco, the track has a raw and rustic feel to it. Subhash elaborates, “There is a certain masti associated with the way Holi is played   North, where bhang is an integral part of the festival, just like playing in the mud, making a makeshift pool, filling it with colours and throwing people into it. We’ve shot the song the way Holi is played in Uttar Pradesh.” 
 
  
  
 The team used about 500 kilos of eco-friendly colours for shooting the song over four days. Subhash says, “Akshay and Huma were absolutely cool and not once did they complain about the colours. They liked the song very much and were keen to shoot it in Lucknow. We were all looking forward to it.” 
 
 Of the nearly 400 dancers in the song, 100 travelled from Mumbai, while the remaining were locals. The director reveals, “We contacted dance schools in Lucknow and nearby areas and requested them to send their students. They were very excited and more than happy to oblige.” 
 
 The filmmaker also lets in that art director Gautam Sen built a realistic set — that of a court — on an existing structure. When asked about the quintessential Akshay element in the song, Subhash asserts that the energy his lead actor has put in is superb. 
 
 “As for the Holi song, the step that Akshay does with a steel bucket is looking very cool. We love the song and hope people like it too,” he sums up.
