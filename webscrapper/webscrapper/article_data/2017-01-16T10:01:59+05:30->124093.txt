PILIBHIT: In the highest-ever penalty imposed by the social forestry division of Pilibhit for killing a neelgai, five poachers were fined Rs 1 lakh. They had killed a young male nilgai in Amaria.
 
  According to range officer of social forestry  , two poachers, Nasir Khan and Nanhe Khan, of village Devrania under Amaria police station, were booked for killing a nilgai on Saturday while their three accomplices — Saleem, Virasat and   — of the same village are absconding. A case under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 was lodged against them.
