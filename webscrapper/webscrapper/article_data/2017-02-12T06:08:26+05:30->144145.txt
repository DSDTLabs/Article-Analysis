PATNA: Minister for commercial taxes   on Saturday directed the department officials to speed up the   process as the tax collected till January 31 this year is still 30.4% short of the target.
 
  Yadav gave the directive at a high-level review meeting in which the focal point was to assess the effect of November 8 note ban on the business and trade activities in the state and its impact on the tax yield to the department.
  
  In order to maximize the tax collection, the minister told the officials to orchestrate their activities and meet the target fixed for the current fiscal ending on March 31. The senior officials of the department, who participated in the review exercise, included principal secretary  ,  , S N Jha and  .
  
  It is learnt that the department had collected Rs15,335 crore till January 31 against the annual target of Rs22,000 crore — or, 69.6% of the target fixed for the current financial year. Incidentally, the tax collected around the same period during the 2015-16 fiscal was Rs15,553 crore. The department feels the difference between the taxes collected in the last two fiscals till January 31 is not very big.
  
  By that token, the tax yielded to the department this financial year is still Rs6,665 crore short of the target, which led the minister to give the directive.
  
  The department, however, was “positive and sanguine” that the final figures at the end of the current fiscal would not be far wide off the target fixed, even as the note ban had downgraded business and trade activities in the state. However, the business began to pick up, even if slowly, from around mid-January. Around one-and-a-half months are still left for the current financial year to close.
