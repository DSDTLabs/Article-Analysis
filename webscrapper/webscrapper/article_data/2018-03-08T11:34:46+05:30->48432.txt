PUNE: The Kondhwa police on Tuesday registered an offence against a 19-year-old youth from Beed for stalking and threatening an engineering student by misusing her photograph and sending her lewd messages.

  
 The suspect has been booked under section 354-D (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Protection (POCSO) Act.
 
 An officer from the Kondhwa police said the 17-year-old complainant is pursuing her engineering degree from a city-based private college. “In September last year, she received a friend’s request on her social media account from the youth,” the officer added.
 
 After she accepted the request, the suspect managed to get details about her profile and cellphone number. “They started chatting on the cellphone. However, when the youth started sending her lewd messages, she stopped responding to him,” the officer said.
 
 Investigations revealed that the youth had hacked into the complainant’s social media account to obtain her photographs. “The suspect allegedly pasted her photograph with that of her male college mate to make it appear that they were photographed together and posted the same on her social media account,” the officer said.
 
 When the girl came to know about it, she confronted him following which the suspect threatened her saying that he would circulate the photograph on the social media. “Frustrated by the harassment, she approached the police,” the officer said. 
 
 Incidentally, the city recorded a marginal 3% drop in overall crimes in 2017, barring incidences of vehicle theft, molestation and drug peddling, as compared to 2016. However, cyber crime complaints and economic offences registered an almost three- and four-fold increase respectively. NCRB data revealed that apart from cheating and computer-related offences, instances were galore about crimes pertaining to publication and transmission of obscene and sexually explicit content.
