 said she is ready to wait for love to come her way. 

  
  
 According to reports, the 49-year-old  , who broke up with her fiance, actor   last year, said she was not in a hurry to get to into a relationship. "I'm not in a rush. I just think it's hard full stop to meet someone where you both have the same feelings for each other. It's a minefield. But it's definitely worth it. Right now, I'm just fine. Let's say," Minogue said .
 
 The 'In My Arms' singer said she has accepted her split with Sasse, 30, and that the duo was "not meant to be together". "Honestly, once I was on my own, it was better. We just were not meant to be together. You try to do your best even if somehow you kind of know you're lying to yourself and you're lying to other people because you're trying to make something work because it's supposed to work."
 
 "But actually you're better off, just if you can find the honesty within -yourself. It definitely helps to have good friends around and family that can look you in the eye and go, 'We're glad we've got your back'," she added.
