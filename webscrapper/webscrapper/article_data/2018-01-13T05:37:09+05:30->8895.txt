KOLKATA: The   ( ) has cleared Ranjan Ghosh’s ‘Rongberonger Korhi’ without a single cut. The film had run into controversy after members of the Hindu Jagran Manch-Kolkata Mahanagar protested against the names of two characters — Ram and Sita — who file for divorce. 

 Ghosh said, “My film was examined on Friday. The CBFC has cleared the film without asking for any modifications. I am very happy with the way the CBFC has viewed my film without any bias and without being under any pressure from fringe groups. This is not only very reassuring, but truly admirable.”
 
 Incidentally, Ghosh’s film also has an element of demonetisation. “Since one of the stories is set in the backdrop of demonetisation, I have shown the impact of notebandi on the common man. I am glad that the CBFC took an objective view of the film and supported the content for what it is,” the director said.
 
 
  
 The board’s verdict has been appreciated by film scholars as well. Film scholar   welcomed the decision, saying: “I’m glad that good sense has prevailed on CBFC. I didn’t even understand why there was a controversy regarding using such names in the film. In ‘Subarnarekha’, Ghatak had used the name Sita for a character who is later forced to take up sex work.”
 
 Regional officer of CBFC Kolkata Samrat Banerjee said, “It is my duty to work. I am happy if CBFC’s work is being appreciated.”
 
 However, Vivek Singh, the public relations officer of Hindu Jagran Manch-Kolkata Mahanagar, could not be contacted for comments on the issue.
