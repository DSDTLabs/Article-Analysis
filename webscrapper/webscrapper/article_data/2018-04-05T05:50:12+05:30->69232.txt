MUMBAI: Thirteen years after underworld don  's brother Deepak   and his construction firm won a piece of prime land in an auction, the Bombay high court has ordered him to return the plot. Justice Suresh Gupte upheld an order of the divisional registrar that Nikhalje had not paid the money within the deadline which meant that the auction was void. The court has given the authorities six weeks' time to recover the plot from   and allowed the original owners the option to buy back the property after paying the bank. 

  The court said that under the law 15% of the amount had to be paid at the time of the auction, while the remaining had to be paid within 15 days. "It is an admitted position that whereas a sum of over 15% of price was paid by Adhishakti at the time of the purchase, the remainder of the purchase money was not paid within 15 days. The remainder was paid four instalments spanning over the next three months," said the judge, adding, "The sale cannot be held to be a lawful sale." 
 
  The plot spread over 810 sqmt is located in   and was owned by the Borse family. In 1994, after the firm failed to repay a loan of Rs 10 lakhs,   took over the land and later put it up for auction. In January 2005, Nikhalje and his firm bid and won the land for Rs 1.51 crores. He paid around Rs 50 lakhs. The balance amount was paid in instalments. Following the payment, the plot was handed over to Adishakti and a conveyance deed was executed in their favour. The court allowed the Borse family to deposit Rs 77 lakhs with the bank within 12 weeks. The bank has been asked to refund the money paid by Nikhalje, who has six weeks time to return the property.
