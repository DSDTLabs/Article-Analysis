Namakkal: “The saints had kept their silence all these days. We will not keep mum anymore. We all know how to hurl soda bottles and stones very well,” said the head of the Srivilliputhur Andal temple Sadagopa Ramanuja Jeeyar, speaking at a meeting in Tiruchengode on Friday, condemning lyricist Vairamuthu for his statement on Hindu deity Andal. Vairamuthu had courted controversy for referring Andal as a devadasi in an essay he wrote for a vernacular daily. Addressing a gathering at an event organised by Mathorupagan Iraipani Mandram and Anaithu Anmeega Amaippugal Mandram, the spiritual leader urged all Hindu forums and outfits to protest against Vairamuthu if he refuses to express an apology on or before February 3. “All Hindus should raise their voice if anyone attacks Hinduism and our Gods. We should not allow them to speak like that.”  He also urged the saints and Hindu gurus to come out and stop those insulting Hindu religion. “We would stage an agitation if anyone insults Hindu Gods. But, we want to face all issues calmly the Ahimsa way.” Earlier, the organisers of the meeting attempted to conduct a rally in Tiruchengode town near the Car Street. But, police refused them permission.
