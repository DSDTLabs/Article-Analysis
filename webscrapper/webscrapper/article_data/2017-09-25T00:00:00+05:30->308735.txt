Singer   was in the city recently for a college fest. We caught up with him to talk about his Kannada stint. “Kannada holds a special space in my heart. Not only is the language sweet, but my earliest memory about Kannada is of a Bengaluru trip in my childhood, where I heard the song Anisutide by  , my idol. It remained in my heart. I have been privileged enough to sing in the sequel to the film and even win an award for it. I presume my pronunciation is good, which is why I’ve been offered to sing songs in big films,” he says.
The singer is currently thrilled about the response to the songs he has sung in   for Darshan. “I’ve sung for two big stars in Kannada, Sudeep and Darshan. If I may say so, they are like the Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan of the industry. I knew of Sudeep before and it was an honour to sing for him. But, singing for Darshan has opened my eyes. He has such a wide fan base and I’ve got many of his fans messaging me thanking me about my singing for their star. It feels great to have sung for him,” says Armaan, who has also sang for the   in Chakravarthy. 
 Armaan plans to be choosy henceforth with the music he chooses. “After being a part of hit films, I have to be a bit choosy about what I take on. Initially, I took on everything since Kannada was an unexplored territory. Also, choosing carefully promotes good professional work. For me, it is the music that appeals. I do take on films with composers I haven’t worked with too, like Sarvasva for instance, where I sang a song called Nee Nanna Loka,” points out Armaan, who holds Arjun Janya, V Harikrishna and   in high regard.
