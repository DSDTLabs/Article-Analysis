Pune: The Bombay Stock Exchange ( ) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) have suspended trading in the shares of DS Kulkarni Developer Limited, following a diktat from the National Companies Law Tribunal late last week.

 As of December 2017, the company had over 20,000 public investors who held about 52% of the firm’s stocks. Number of equity shares held by public as on December 2017 was over 1.35 crore or an average of about 600 shares per investor. It is not clear how many residual investors or their stocks are unsold as on the date of suspension.
 
 In its order, the NCLT said the bourses and the Securities and Exchange Board of India are directed to restrain the trading of securities of DS Kulkarni Developer Ltd.
 
 It also directed the Central and National Securities Depository Limited to freeze the securities held by the promoters, executive directors and key managerial persons of the company. For the time being, the NCLT has excluded the four independent directors but said if the Serious Fraud Investigations Office (SFIO) finds any “incriminating material” against any independent director, it can seek relief against them as well.
 
 The NCLT said the promoters, executive directors and the key managerial personnel of the company be restrained from mortgaging or creating any charge on the properties held by them. As on March 21, the company was valued at Rs 35.09 crore. Next hearing on the matter is slated on April 9, 2018.
