 The Golden Globes blackout supported the #TimesUp movement, an initiative founded by 300 women in the entertainment industry. Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Eva Longoria are among many prominent women, who have formed this anti-harassment coalition. The movement's website reads: "TIMEâ€™S UP is a unified call for change from women in entertainment for women everywhere. From movie sets to farm fields to boardrooms alike, we envision nationwide leadership that reflects the world in which we live." 
 
 
 The long-overdue movement will help to connect people, who have experienced sexual harassment with attorneys who can provide legal assistants including a free consultation. The Time's Up Legal Defense Fund will subsidize legal support for such individuals. While the group will also give access to prompt and comprehensive legal and communication help.
