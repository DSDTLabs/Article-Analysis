PATNA:   Lalu Prasad on Sunday tried to downplay the controversy over denial of seat to him on the dais (where PM and CM was sitting) during a   at   on January 5, saying some people have habit of pointing out drawbacks and shortcomings in any such mega programme and creating controversies. 

 “People perform worship by sitting on ‘zamin’ (ground). What is wrong if I was sitting on the carpet?” he asked. Terming the controversy as “unnecessary”, Lalu said whatever statement the RJD national vice president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh issued over “denial” of a seat to him, was his “personal views”.
 
 Earlier, Raghubansh Singh had raised questions over denial of a seat to the RJD president at the main podium from where PM Narendra Modi and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar addressed the gathering. Congress state president Ashok Choudhary had said that the sitting arrangement at the PM’s podium was cleared by the Prime Minister office (PMO). Hence, the PMO should be asked as to why Lalu Prasad, being an important leader of the ruling grand alliance in Bihar, was not given a seat on the podium along with Union ministers.
