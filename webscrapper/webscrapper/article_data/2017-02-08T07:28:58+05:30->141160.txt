SURAT: Police booked   (PAAS) members at detection of crime branch (DCB) police station here on Tuesday for allegedly circulating messages intending to provoke people to gherao a police station in the city. PAAS members circulated several graphic images and had asked their sympathizers to join them in gheraoing a police station here on Thursday. 

 Police booked PAAS members under Indian Penal Code sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). 
 
 PAAS planned to gherao Puna police station with a demand that an offence be registered against those who had thrashed PAAS member Vijay Mangukiya. 
 
 PAAS convener   had threatened police inspector of Puna police station earlier over phone during his visit to the city and said that PAAS will gherao the police station if Mangukiya’s compliant was not registered. 
 
 Mangukiya was allegedly thrashed by   (BJYM) members when he tried to throw ink and water at BJYM state president Rutvij Patel at a rally. PAAS had also sought police permission to form a human chain around Puna police station, but it was rejected. 
 
 “Police came to know about some messages being circulated over social media asking people to join them in gheraoing a police station. Police registered an offence after investigation and those responsible for circulating these messages will be arrested,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said. 
 
 Meanwhile, the police approached a local court on Tuesday to seek permission to register Mangukiya’s complaint and the court gave its approval. Police later registered an offence at Puna police station. 
 
 “Mangukiya’s complaint was registered by the police. As it was a non-cognizable offence, we had to seek the court’s approval to investigate it. Since we have got the approval, the case has been registered and now investigation will be done,” Sharma said.
