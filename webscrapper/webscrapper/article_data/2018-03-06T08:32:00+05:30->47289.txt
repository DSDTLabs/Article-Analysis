JALANDHAR: Relations between Conservative MP Deepak  , who represents Calgary Forest Lawn constituency of   in the Canadian parliament, and some members of the Sikh community appear to be worsening after the episode of controversial motion mentioning "Khalistani terrorism" and "united India". 

 With Obhrai facing criticism, the Gurdwara Dashmesh Cultural Society, Calgary, has announced to rescind the invitation sent to him for the 'Khalsa Day Parade'. The 'Nagar Kirtan' is taken out to celebrate   festival and thousands of Sikhs participate in it. The decision to rescind the invitation was announced by gurdwara president Ranbir Singh Parmar in a congregation on Sunday. The video of Parmar's announcement is being widely shared on social media platforms.
 
 It was after their intense lobbying with Conservative MPs and Sikh leaders of the party that the motion was put on hold. On March 3, Obhrai posted on his official Facebook page that he had come under attack from a few individuals from the Sikh community "in reference to his stance on the unity of India and on the term genocide".
