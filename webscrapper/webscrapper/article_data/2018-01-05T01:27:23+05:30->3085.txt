Chennai:   working president   on Thursday said his party’s Rajya Sabha MPs would cooperate with their   counterparts in the Lok Sabha for getting a facility on the lines of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( ) in Tamil Nadu.

 In a statement, Stalin said the Central government had failed to fulfil its promise of setting up an AIIMS in the state despite making an announcement in the 2015-16 Union budget.
 
  “An expert team from the Central government in 2015 had visited the five sites (Thanjavur, Madurai, Pudukottai, Erode and Chengalpet) offered by the Tamil Nadu government for setting up AIIMS. But even after two years no decision has been taken yet,” said Stalin. 
 
 He blamed the state for delaying information requested by the Centre to proceed further even as the Madurai bench of the Madras high court had ordered the Centre to finalise the location by December 31. 
 
 “The AIADMK government is busy with solving its own problems and has no time for solving the issues affecting the state. The Central government must take immediate steps to build an AIIMS in the state,” said Stalin.
