RAJKOT:   and getting   in Saurashtra’s commercial capital may get costlier from the next financial year.

 In the draft budget for 2018-2019, the   (RMC) has proposed doubling in water tax and 150% increase in the road tax. This the first time after 10 years that taxes have been hiked in the city’s municipal budget.
 
 Municipal commissioner Banchha Nidhi Pani proposed Rs 1,727.57 crore budget, which he said aims at ‘Smart Rajkot, Liveable Rajkot and Sustainable Rajkot’.
 
 The road tax calculated, which is currently 1% of the vehicle cost, has been proposed to be increased to 2.5%. The aim is to curb nagging traffic problem and environment pollution, said Pani. Handicapped citizens will be given exemption from vehicle tax. Pani said 50,000 vehicles are added in the city every year, which creates huge traffic and severe parking problem besides pollution. 
 
 “The estimated cost of providing water is Rs 118 crore in 2018-19. At the prevailing rates, we recover only 27% cost from the users. Though the water tax is proposed to be doubled, we will still face a 47.5%,” Said Pani. 
 
 
  
 
 The 24x7 water supply project will be implemented on a pilot bases in a few areas this summer. The Asian Development Bank has provided Rs 300 crore loan for this project out of which the civic body will spend Rs 100 crore in the first phase. The RMC will provide 24 hours water to 45,000 households of west zone and two wards of central zone in the first phase. Water meters will be installed in 15,0000 households to collect the water bill before March 31.
