 Ja Rule has confirmed the safety of all Fyre Festival guests after the event descended into chaos on April 28. The event, co-created by Ja Rule, was scheduled to take place in the Bahamas this weekend and was touted as a unique, multi-day luxury music and arts festival celebrity chef- catered meals and impressive accommodations.

  
  
 In reality, the festival appeared to be half-finished when attendees started arriving and many bands including headliner   had dropped out of the lineup. Attendees also complained about the lack of services and overall chaos involved in trying to get to the actual venue. 
  
 The 41-year-old singer apologised for the inconvenience caused. 
 
 "Relieved to share that all guest are safe, and have been sent the form to apply for a refund. Our deepest apologies... #fyrefestival (sic)" 
 
 Ja Rule also insisted the blunder wasn't his fault, but said he was "taking responsibility" and working on returning the money to disappointed revellers.
