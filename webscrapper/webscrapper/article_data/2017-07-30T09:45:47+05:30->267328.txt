PUNE: The   has dismissed a special leave   against the Bombay high court’s interim stay on the defence ministry’s no-objection certificate to a   (SRA) project being developed by a realtor within 100 metres of the crest of the outer parapet of the Indian Air Force Station at Lohegaon. The high court had ordered the interim stay on April 25.

 An apex court bench of Justice Arun Mishra and Justice Amitava Roy said in an order on July 24, “We find no reason to entertain this special leave petition (SLP), which is, accordingly, dismissed. Pending application(s), if any shall stand disposed of. However, considering the nature of the dispute, we request the high court to decide the matter expeditiously, as far as possible, within six months,” the bench added.
 
 The project developer had moved the apex court by filing the SLP on July 3, arguing, among other things, that the HC erred in directing an interim stay on the NOC and did not aptly appreciate the procedural aspects regarding grant of NOC to buildings and structures in the vicinity of the air force base.
 
 The developer sought the apex court’s consideration on questions of law such as the defence ministry’s power to issue NOC under the Aircraft Act provisions; the locus standi of the petitioners, who have approached the high court; maintainability of their petition; and whether any fundamental right of these petitioners had been violated due to the SRA project. 
 
 The developer pointed out that the same petitioners have moved the   (NGT) bench in Pune on the same matter and their application is pending there.
 
 Anilkumar Surapaneni, a petitioner in the high court matter, told TOI on Saturday, “The developer’s SLP was heard at length by the SC bench, but the arguments raised in favour of a stay on the high court’s interim relief did not impress the bench.” 
 
 Surapaneni was present at the hearing of the special leave petition before the apex court bench.
