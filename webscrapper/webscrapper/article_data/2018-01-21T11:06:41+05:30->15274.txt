PUNE: The   ( ) has issued notices to about 200 vendors for vacating extra space they have been occupying illegally at the Shivaji Market.

 The board authorities said the move aims to free up space in the market for the convenience of people visiting the area. The notices were sent after PCB president   and chief executive officer DN Yadav visited the market and carried out a survey on January 17.
 
 “As the board has decided to renovate the market, it was necessary to take stock of the situation. During the visit, we found many vendors occupied extra space in the market illegally. We need to change this and have sent notices to these vendors to vacate the extra space,” Yadav said on Saturday.
 
 The board has already decided to spend about Rs 1.5 crore on the renovation work of the British-era market. A tender process has already been initiated by the board for the purpose. “Our plan is to carry out renovation work in four phases. We will also improve basic facilities, such as drainage system, water supply, among others, here,” Yadav said, adding that after completing the tender process, a detailed design of renovation will be released.
 
 Last year, the board had taken stringent action against illegal chicken shops operating in the cantonment areas. 
 
 Yusuf Bagwan, Shivaji Market Vegetable Association president said, “It’s a positive move by the board. Our only request is to take action against hawkers, who are illegally running their businesses outside the market.”
