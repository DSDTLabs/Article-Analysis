LUCKNOW:   death—first in the city this year—was reported in the city on Wednesday. Two more   were reported, taking total number in the city to 19 since February. The death took place at a private hospital. Lucknow chief medical officer Dr G S Bajpai said, “Neither the   in which the   was being treated nor the family informed the department timely. We will verify facts on Thursday and will take action against the private hospital for not informing on time,” he said.

 According to rules, every private and government hospital needs to notify health department of a dengue case as soon as it is reported so that necessary arrangements are made for treatment of the patient as well as precautions for others in the area. In this case, however, health department was informed after the patient suffering from dengue died.
