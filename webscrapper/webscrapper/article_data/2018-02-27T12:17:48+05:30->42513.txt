BHUBANESWAR: With only a couple of days left for  , markets in the city have been flooded with  . This year, masks are in trend; a large variety of masks - some more suitable for   - and wigs in different shapes and sizes are flying off the shelves. Besides, traditional favourites such as water guns ( ) and colour balloons are also being bought in large numbers. 

 "Spooky masks are the rage this Holi. I have a collection of more than 50 varieties of masks," said Kartika Biswal, a shopkeeper in the   here. He added that more and more people were using masks to play Holi without getting any chemical colour on their skin. "It is always better to play safely. So I send my children to play with colours only after arming them with masks, caps, full-sleeve cotton clothes and slapping on oil or Vaseline on their bodies," said Pratima Sahu, a housewife who bought a pair of masks, caps and pichkaris for her children.
 
 The cost of the masks ranges from Rs 50 to Rs 500 depending on the shape, size and material. Similarly, that of the caps ranges from Rs 50 to Rs 300. "The spooky masks are scary. I also bought some Spiderman and Doraemon masks for my children. Holi is a festival of love and we should avoid spooky masks now," said Saswati Rath, another housewife.
 
 Besides masks and wigs, a large variety of water guns are also available in the market. Backpack-style water guns are the latest hits. 
 
 "These water guns have the capacity to carry two to three litres of water at a time so children are keen to buy them. Moreover, they are easy to use and look attractive," said Ramesh Sahu, another shopkeeper. The price of the water guns range from Rs 10 to Rs 500.
 
 This year, almost all shops have stocked up on herbal colours. Very few are selling chemical colours. "Most consumers ask for herbal colours. They are ready to pay extra for this. So there's no point stocking chemical colours," Sahu explained.
