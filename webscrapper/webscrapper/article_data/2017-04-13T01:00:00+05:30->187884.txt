It was recently reported that India would be one of the locations where 'Mission: Impossible 6' would be shot, but multiple sources tell us that   and the film's cast is not heading towards the subcontinent for filming. Photos of Cruise performing stunts in Paris surfaced online on Tuesday, and sources say that the production company hasn't made any move to seek permission to shoot in India yet. "It takes quite long for the ministry to give permission and the officials of the production company have not even contacted any ministry official for permission yet. There has been no communication in this regard," a source tells us.

  Another source says, "We found out that they will be shooting in   and the scenes which were supposed to be shot in India can easily be replicated in New Zealand or Morocco. Nothing is final yet, but till now, they have not approached anyone for permissions."
 
  Sources say that one reason for them not heading to India could be the delay in permissions and disruptions during the shoot. A source says, "India has had a history with film shooting permissions and disturbances. Ali Fazal's film 'Victoria And Abdul' was shot in Mehtab Bagh in Agra, but they didn't return to India for the second leg of filming because some activists protested against the installation of a statue of Queen Victoria. To avoid such disturbances, Agra was recreated in London."
 
 
  
  In November, the shoot of the British-American biographical film was disrupted. Sources say that shoot disruptions is one of the probable reasons why   won't be shot in India
 
  In a recent interview, cast member Rebecca Ferguson talked about the shooting locations for 'Mission: Impossible 6', saying, "I'm going to New Zealand and Paris!" She made no mention of India. Christopher McQuarrie, who directed 'Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation', is also directing the new installment, 'Mission: Impossible- 6'.
