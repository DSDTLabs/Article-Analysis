Looks like   and director Adhik’s father, who is also a part of AAA, share a good rapport on the set of the film. Talking about them,   says, “Appa is really happy about the way   has shaped up. I narrated him the story of  ... only during the shoot of the film. Regarding Simbu’s film, he asked me the full script even before the first day of the shoot. He has worked in this film, too, and in fact he has become a good friend of Simbu. STR used to gossip about me and tell my father my secrets! It was fun to shoot with people we love. My dad has done only a small role in this film.
