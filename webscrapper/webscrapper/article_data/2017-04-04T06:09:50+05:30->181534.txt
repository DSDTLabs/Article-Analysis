AHMEDABAD: The   has declared that the   will be on Wednesday instead of Tuesday as declared earlier. The RTO has stated that those who have taken appointments for   or fitting of number plates can come to the RTO on Tuesday instead of Wednesday. The RTO has issued the statement apparently as the recent change in   holiday had led to acrimonious scenes at the office. “Last week, when the Cheti Chand holiday was changed, several people had created ruckus at the RTO, forcing the officials to reach the office on a holiday and pacify people gathered there,” said an official. “Usually, the holidays are notified by the government but in this case, the RTO wants to inform the people to come a day in advance,” the official added. tnn
