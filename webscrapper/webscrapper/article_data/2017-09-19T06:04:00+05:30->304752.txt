Nagpur: Mahametro has completed all tests for the   between Mihan and Khapri metro rail stations. The trial run can now be undertaken anytime in this stretch of 1.50km.

 On Monday, Mahametro successfully ran Buland — the electrical shunting vehicle utilized for track testing — between Mihan depot and Khapri metro rail station. “All tests have been done successfully on the track between Mihan depot and Khapri. Senior chief project manager (rolling stock) Janak Kumar Garg, additional chief project manager (track) Ravi Kumar, and senior deputy general manager (depot) Sai Sharan Dixit tested Buland on the stretch. The test was successful in all manners. Now, Metro rail trial run can be conducted in this stretch,” Mahametro official said.
 
 Mahametro had commenced trial run from Mihan depot to some distance towards Khapri early this month.
 
 Mahametro official added now the target is to do the test run from Khapri to New Airport metro rail station. “Various types of tests and works are going on in this stretch. Trial run of Metro rail can be done from New Airport metro rail station to Mihan depot once test run on the stretch between Khapri and New Airport metro rail station is completed,” he said.
 
 Mahametro will invite Union minister for road transport, highways, shipping and water resources Nitin Gadkari, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, and SBI chairperson-cum-managing director (CMD) Arundhati Bhattacharya for formal inauguration of trial run next month.
 
 Mahametro is planning to launch commercial operation of Metro rail between New Airport station and Mihan by November-end. Series of formalities, including clearances from Research Design and Standards Organization (RDSO), commissioner of Metro rail safety (CMRS) etc are required before commercial operations can begin.
 
 Trial run was supposed to kick-off in June but have been delayed. As per initial deadline, Metro rail was to be completed by March 2018, which seems to be a distant dream.
