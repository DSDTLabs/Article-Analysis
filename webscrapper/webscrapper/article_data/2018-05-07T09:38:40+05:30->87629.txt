CHANDIGARH: Panjab University senate on Sunday gave final approval to 10% tuition fee hike for new admissions and 5% for ongoing classes from the 2018-19 session. However, the examination fee hike was reduced from the proposed Rs 200 per semester to Rs 75 per semester. The user and maintenance charges for the ongoing admissions is 5% and for the new entrants is 10%.

 Now, the tuition fee for the self-financing courses, except UIAMS and MPharma, would be increased by 5% for the ongoing classes and 10% for the new admissions. The tuition fee of UIAMS has increased by Rs 7,500 per annum.
 
 Moreover, on the suggestion of senator  , the senate decided that there would be no fee hike for the new courses introduced initially for around three years. On the issue of the fee hike, senators Prof Chaman Lal, DPS Randhawa and   recorded their dissent, stating that there should be no fee hike.
 
 senator   raised the issue that the student community has no problem with the fee hike provided students are facilitated. “The equipment in our labs is obsolete. We should provide the basic teaching infrastructure to our students at least,” said Goswami.
 
 On this, PU vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover said that the income generated from the fee should be utilized to provide better infrastructure and other facilities to students.
 
 Finance development officer (FDO)   said that earlier the committee had recommended enhancing the tuition fee by 20%, however, student representatives did not agree with 20% hike and that is why, the fee hike was reduced from 20% to 10%. Senator   said last year when the house was discussing the fee hike, every member had agreed that there should be regular fee hike and not a sudden one.
