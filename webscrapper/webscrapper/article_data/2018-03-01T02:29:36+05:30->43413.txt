MUMBAI: The   on Wednesday told the   it should start creating awareness about sexual harassment in schools. 
 
 “Creating awareness about these issues from class V onward will ensure we create a generation of civilised adults,” said a division bench of Justices Naresh Patil and Girish Kulkarni. 
  
 “If you only create awareness in colleges, then you are reaching out to those who are already adults and have set notions and attitudes. Reach out to students when they are still young and teach them about gender equality, respecting their colleagues and women, and to behave respectfully and form healthy relationships,” said Justice Patil. 
  
 The court’s remarks were made during hearing of a public interest litigation by Maharashtra State Commission for Women. 
  
 Manjusha Molwane, member secretary in charge of the commission, said while most complaints it receives are of domestic violence, sexual harassment complaints have been on the rise in recent years. The commission undertakes campaigns in colleges, state government offices and other places about sexual harassment. 
  
 The bench observed that such awareness campaigns must also include men. “Invite men—husbands, fathers and sons—to your programmes. The women’s commission should also include men as they are usually the perpetrators of domestic violence and violence against women,” added Justice Patil.
