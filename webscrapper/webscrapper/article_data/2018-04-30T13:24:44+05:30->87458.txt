PANAJI: A   facilitation counter set up at the South Goa collectorate building in Margao has begun functioning on a trial basis. Those from South Goa looking to make a new passport neednâ€™t travel all the way to the regional passport office at Patto, Panaji, but can book appointments at the post office Passport Seva Kendra. The move is a joint effort by the department of post and ministry of external affairs.

 Since last week, the office in Margao has begun accepting 20 appointments a day for fresh Indian passports. When filling the form online, applicants are presented with the option of booking their appointments at the Margao office.
 
 Once the required fee is paid and when an appointment is booked online, citizens can submit self-attested copies of their documents at this counter where these are verified with the original documents that applicants are expected to carry along with them. The counter is also equipped to take photographs of applicants and capture all their biometric data. The files and data are then transferred to the regional passport office in Panaji where these are processed.
 
 Online payment is mandatory for booking appointments at the passport seva kendras. Once the online payment of application fee is made and appointment is confirmed, it can be rescheduled or cancelled only twice within a year of the first appointment date.
