AHMEDABAD: Police on Thursday arrested   on transfer warrant from   in a complaint of   investors to the tune of Rs 5 crore. Police sources said there are several offences registered against Parulkar and his sister   for cheating thousands with three-monthly and six-monthly schemes meant to double or triple investments.

 According to sources, 17 people have lodged complaints against the brother-sister duo at Maninagar police station, and the total amount of the scam can be over Rs 100 crore.
 
 “Parulkar and his sister Satpalkar had opened a company,   plotters, and had invited investors promising high returns. “They used to purchase land in Maharashtra and sell it on appreciated price. Initially, they did give returns to the investors, but of late they had been making false promises until one day the investors found their offices locked,” said a Maninagar police official.
 
 Police officials said Maharashtra police had recently arrested Parulkar on the basis of several such cheating complaints lodged against him.
