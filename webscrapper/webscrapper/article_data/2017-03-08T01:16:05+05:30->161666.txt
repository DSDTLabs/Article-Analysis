Chennai: The Centre will implement the   across the country, said Union commerce minister   on Tuesday.

 “By learning three languages, a child’s knowledge will be enriched and he/she will become multi-lingual. I will take up the issue with Union HRD minister Prakash Javdekar,” she said while launching the digital platform of the 100-year-old Madras   College. 
 
 By three languages, she did not mean learning Sanskrit, the minister said. “It is not something new which we plan to implement. In many states it is being practised... We want a uniform learning of languages,” she said.
 
 Sanskrit, she said, was taught in schools in Croatia. “Traces of Sanskrit can be found in languages spoken in the Philippines...,” said the minister. 
 
 “Sanskrit is simple and at the same time versatile. That is one of the reasons in the digital era we have realised that it is best accepted globally for anything to do with digital performance for a language,” she said. 
 
 “Sanskrit was the language of communication Raja Raja [Chola] used after his conquest of south-east Asian nations. We are not asking people to shun their local language and learn Sanskrit but learning Sanskrit will make children rejoice ... it should not be looked as a burden,” said Sitharaman.
 
 She narrated an incident in Gujarat’s Mehsana district. “There was shortage of Atharva Veda scholars and Mehsana district had an entire village full of scholars of Atharva Veda. One scholar was brought to Tirupati by the Kanchi Paramacharya before Independence to impart the veda to students there. The family finally disappeared and I traced them to Baroda. I spoke to the grandchildren of the scholar. The son was employed in a bank in Madhya Pradesh and told me he was not interested in learning Sanskrit or the Veda, but the girl wanted to learn after finishing chartered accountancy,” said Sitharaman.
