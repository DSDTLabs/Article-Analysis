CHENNAI: More than 170 passengers were stranded inside a   flight for four hours at   on Saturday after the   while entering a taxiway. Other flights were not delayed and the plane was grounded. 

 The flight scheduled to depart at 11.30am was taxiing when the brakes jammed. Attempts to release the brakes failed and the plane was towed to a parking bay around 3.30pm, an Air India official said. Passengers had to wait inside as authorities could not bring a ladder to take them out.
 
 Later, around 120 passengers were moved to the terminal and taken to a city hotel, while others tried to reschedule the trip or book on other flights. 
 
 "We are bringing spare parts from Mumbai to rectify the defect. The passengers were served food and beverages inside the aircraft. Passengers were immediately not disembarked as technicians were trying to set right the snag. As the effort failed, we alerted Mumbai," he said. 
 
 The airline was trying to take the passengers on a spare plane to be brought from Mumbai. An   (AAI) official said, "The stranded plane did not affect schedules of other flights because it was about to enter a taxiway. Other flights were routed via an alternative taxiway." 
 
 AI's Dreamliner fleet had been hit by a spate of snags in the last two years. In March 2016, a B787 aircraft to be used on   route had to be changed at the last minute after an aircraft was grounded at Paris airport. The airline had to rush engineers to Paris to rectify the snag. 
 
 The national carrier has 21 Dreamliners in its fleet and plans to induct another six next year. The engineers' union had earlier urged the management to demand compensation from the manufacturer.
