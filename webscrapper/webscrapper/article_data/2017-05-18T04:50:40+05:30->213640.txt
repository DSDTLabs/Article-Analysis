NEW DELHI: A year after the hashtag ‘IWearHandloom’ trended on Twitter, Union   minister   is back at it. On Tuesday, she tweeted a selfie in a cotton sari, with the hashtag ‘CottonIs-Cool’, and asked netizens to post their selfies and tag five friends. Soon, the hashtag started trending, with people still tweeting their pictures in cotton attire.

 While   has kept a low profile in the textiles ministry, her Twitter campaigns seem to be a hit, enforcing her image as a social media savvy politician. It’s the second twitter campaign of Irani which has managed to get people talking, even as she has consciously stayed away from traditional media, preferring to be visible on twitter and Instagram etc.
 
 Irani’s #CottonIsCool campaign certainly got the attention of twitterati. Following up her selfie with posts in which she termed cotton as a “celebration of Indian summer and the cotton industry”, Irani had celebrities and regular folk, not to mention her Cabinet colleagues posting pictures of themselves in cotton wear.
 
 The list had names like Advaita Kala, Amish Tripathi, Rajat Sharma, Gul Panag, Randeep Hooda, Anita Dongre, Vir Sanghvi, Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif, Manish Malhotra, Kirron Kher, Hema Malini and Vijender Singh. Those from the government included Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Kiran Rijuju, Piyush Goyal, Manohar Lal Khattar, Swapan Dasgupta etc. Minister for railways Suresh Prabhu and minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha expressed their support as well, with Prabhu calling it his personal choice.
 
 The Twitter outreach programme seemed to have worked as hundreds of common folk posted selfies as well, while tagging others.
