BENGALURU: Almost all CBSE schools in the city recorded 100% pass in the Class 12 exam results announced on Saturday. And girls outperformed boys again. Schools say girls are more methodical in their approach with board exams while boys focus on competitive exams.

 
 Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, DPS (Bengaluru and Mysuru), analysed the performance in DPS schools: “We have been consistent in the overall performance every year. Usually, our schools have better performers in science and commerce but this year, our students in humanities also did well.”
 
 He added that girls are more focused and that’s the reason for their success. “This is consistent across curricula and over the years. Girls give equal weightage to board and competitive exams,” he added.
 
 Deepa Sridhar, principal, Sri Kumaran Children’s Home, Mallasandra agreed: “Girls are more methodical in their approach while boys concentrate on competitive exams. Boys usually do not give much importance to English and finetune their answers, which girls can do better,” she told STOI. “The evaluation process has been elaborate this year, with two teachers checking each paper. More students secured centums this year compared to last year,” she added.
 
 Jyotsna Nair, principal, National Public School, Koramangala campus, said the focus on academics yielded 100% results. “NPS gives a lot of importance to academics but we also support co-curricular activities to ensure there’s a balance and this acts as a stressbuster. For under-performers, we conducted remedial classes and held one-onone sessions with students and parents a month ahead of the exams.”
 
 “There is always healthy competition between boys and girls in our school, in academics and co-curricular activities,” said Veena Sahani, principal of Army Public School on Kamaraj Road.
