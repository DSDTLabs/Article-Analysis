It happens to be a form of dance I have always admired and loved since childhood. I'm really excited and looking forward to this. I enjoy learning new things and challenging myself, so this process has been nothing short of fun. I am grateful to be working with Remo D’souza (producer) and Stanley D’Costa (director). I get constant feedback from them as we progress with our training and it’s encouraging. The entire team has such great energy about them. I am thrilled to be a part of this film.”
