CHENNAI: Forest officials rescued 156 Alexandrine parakeets from a house at   on Friday morning. The that were 45-day-old birds were to be sold as pets. 

 According to wildlife officials, the young birds collected from the scrub jungles of Andhra Pradesh were kept in the house of 50-year-old Mujeeb Hussain on Kuttiappan Street.

 Traders lure youth having smartphones into this illegal business with an assured commission for selling each specimen. A couple of days ago wildlife authorities arrested a 25-year-old software engineer who advertised online that the Alexandrine parakeets were on sale. A pan-India network is involved in the trade.

Apart from the pet shops, these birds are commonly sold in weekly shandies that happen in suburban areas such as   in the city, Shekhar said. A single specimen of this bird is being sold at 2,500 in pet shops in the city.
