Visakhapatnam: Cine star and senior woman TDP leader Kavitha walked out from the Mahanadu after she was denied entry on the dais by the organisers here on Saturday. 

 The organisers had accommodated around 240 leaders, MLAs, MPs, ministers and state party committee members and a few important people on the dais. But the list did not have Kavitha’s name.
 
 Hurt by the behaviour of the organisers, Kavitha expressed her anger and walked away from the Mahanadu premises with tears in her eyes. 
 
 Speaking to the media, Kavitha said she was insulted after being invited to the Mahanadu. 
 
 “I have been in the party when the party was not in the power and I worked for the TDP sincerely. The leaders in the party invited me on the dais when the party was in the opposition. The same leaders are now insulting me after coming to the power,” she alleged. She said their behaviour is forcing her to think of resigning from the party.
