THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The low demand for commercial space at KSRTC bus terminal,   and low income generation are forcing   (KTDFC) to consider other options.  , which has been entrusted with the construction of the terminal on BOT basis, will soon rent out space for advertising, aiming at increased revenue generation.

 “It is for the first time that space for advertising is being leased out. The proposal to utilize the vacant space in the terminal was approved in the board meeting. As the advertising space is proposed for LED screens, KSRTC can associate with the companies taking up the work and include the bus time schedules and other required information for the passengers. Being a transit station, we hope to receive good revenue through this scheme,” said a KTDFC official.
 
 Similar project was taken up by railways at   railway station, where LED screens are installed for providing information to passengers and also for advertising.
 
 Leasing out commercial space at the terminal has fetched only less than 10% of the amount spent for the terminal. Initially the cost for construction of the terminal was estimated at Rs 55.94 crore. Later it escalated to Rs 81 crore.
 
 As per the information received from KTDFC, nearly 16,000 square feet area in the ten-storey building is remaining vacant even after completion of nine rounds of tenders. And no net operational income has been generated till March, 2017, from leasing out space at the terminal.
 
 Several government agencies came forward to acquire space in the terminal following a directive from the chief minister. Government agencies have come forward to acquire nearly 20,000 sq.ft area. Two agencies have already signed the lease agreement
