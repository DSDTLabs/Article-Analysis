NEW DELHI: Every morning,   used to take his cart of oranges to   and sit at gate number 2. His net profit at the end of the day used to be up to Rs 300. 

 With that, he used to buy food, pay for his father’s drinks, and save the rest for his wife who lived with the rest of the family in Indore,  .
 
  Sompal struggled to make both ends meet. With his death, his family’s world has turned upside down. His father now plans to return to Indore to take care of the family.
 
 Sompal had been home for a month and had only recently returned to the capital, only to find that the spot where he used to put up his cart had been occupied by another vendor. “We select the space to put up our carts so that we can have the maximum number of customers. The argument on the day of the incident was a fallout of this,” said Sompal’s cousin, Tinu Jamadar. 
 
 He said when the police had arrived, the others had fled so Sompal was caught. “He was earlier caught for similar brawls as well, so the police took him,” said his father Dayaluram. 
 
 The day after, the family had gone to the police station looking for Sompal, but was told that he wasn’t there. Assuming that he had gone to meet some friend, the family had stopped looking. “He used to take breaks often to visit friends in  , returning after a few days,” Dayaluram said. 
 
 The family also contested the police’s theory as Sompal “was not athletic enough to attempt a jump”.
