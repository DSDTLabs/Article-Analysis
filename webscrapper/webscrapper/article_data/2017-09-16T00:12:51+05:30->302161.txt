MUMBAI: The   government has demanded that the bullet train corridor between Mumbai and Howrah should be aligned parallel to the Nagpur Expressway.

 The project’s feasibility is being studied by Adif, the infrastructure firm owned by the Spanish government. 
 
 “Chief minister   has conveyed to the railway ministry that the route between Mumbai and Nagpur should not follow the existing rail corridor. Instead, it should be aligned to the Mumbai-Nagpur Samrudhi Corridor,” a senior official said. 
 
 Currently, the travel time by train from Kolkata to Mumbai varies from 26 to 40 hours. Duranto takes 26 hours to reach CST while Jnaneswari Express takes 30 hours to reach LTT. The high-speed bullet train can reduce the travel time to less than 10 hours.
 
 A railway official said, “It makes sense if the project follow this alignment is it will touch important cities, besides land for the project will not pose hurdles as the   government has initiated the process to acquire land.”
 
 The   passes through important districts like Thane, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Amravti and Nagpur.
 
 The 701-km highway named as   will go through 24 districts, especially the drought-hit regions. The project is being modeled on land-pooling base to ensure participation and dividends to farmers and individuals whose land would be acquired for the project, government had claimed. About 24 townships will be developed with basic amenities and related infrastructure. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation will be the executing agency for the project.
