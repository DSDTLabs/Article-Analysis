NEW DELHI:   may be over with the mercury crossing the 30-degree-Celsius mark for the first time this season.

 The maximum temperature recorded was 31.7 degrees Celsius – seven notches above normal. This was also the warmest day recorded this month and Met officials said the temperature was unlikely to go below 29 degrees in the next few weeks. It was also the second warmest February 21 in the last decade, as the city recorded 32.4 degrees Celsius on the day last year.
 
 “Mercury is likely to stay around 31 degrees Celsius for the next few days, barring a slight drop on February 24 due to cloudy skies and thundery development. The chance of rain, however, is very little as the western disturbance is going to affect further up north,” said  , scientist at Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC).
 
 Forecast for Thursday shows the mercury hovering over a similar range with the maximum and minimum temperatures likely to be 31 and 12 degrees Celsius respectively, officials said.
 
 Experts said Delhi’s rise in temperatures, combined with efforts under the ‘Clean Air for Delhi’ campaign are likely to bring down pollution levels once again, which touched the upper limit of ‘poor’ on Wednesday with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 290. “Rise in temperatures and the continued efforts are likely to bring down pollution levels in the next few days,” said  , former head of CPCB’s air laboratory.
