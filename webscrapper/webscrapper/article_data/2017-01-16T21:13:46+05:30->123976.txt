Singer   will go on to judge the hindi show   Lil Champs 2016-17. The show is known to highlight young talent. Madhura, who has herself been a contestant on the   and Hindi editions of the show, will have done the industry proud by now stepping on the show in the capacity of a judge.

 Young participants can be sure that Madhura will be the just and ideal mentor, considering that she too has gone through the various processes that the platform comprises before. She mentioned that she understands the pressure these little stars face, and highlighted the need for correct guidance and fair, but less-strict judgement.
 
 As is expected, Madhura shared that the auditions around the country have been ruled by the   fever; not just in  , but also cities outside the state, including Vadodara in Gujarat. Many children sang the film's super hit tracks.
 
 Madhura is known for rendering tracks for films including Raja Shiv Chhatrapati, Sandook and Vazandar and various serials, including Honar Soon MiYaGharchi and Amhi Dogha Raja Rani, which is currently airing. While she is quite content judging the hindi edition of the show, she would love more so judging the Marathi edition, considering that's where she came from.
 
 Here's wishing Madhura the very best as judge on the show.
