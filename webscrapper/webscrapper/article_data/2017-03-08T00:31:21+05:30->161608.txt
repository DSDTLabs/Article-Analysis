MUMBAI: Results of several important exams held in November are yet to be announced even as Mumbai University’s plans to carry out online assessment for April exams has taken off. 

 The delay in the announcement of results will give little time for students to apply for re-evaluation in cases of discrepancies and will also prove to be a hindrance to their plans of studying abroad. The results of semester V exams of third year BMS, BAF, BBI and BFM students, held over three months ago, are still awaited. As many as 30,000 students may have appeared only for these four exams.
 
 A student from a suburban college said that he wanted to submit his application to a US university for higher studies, but he missed the February deadline and may have to look for other options now. 
 
 Many students have taken to social media to reach out to university officials with their plaints. “If we do not get the results on time, we will not be able to apply for re-evaluation as the repeaters’ exams are scheduled from April 5. Last year, our seniors had to face a lot of problems due to the discrepancies in the BMS results. If they repeat it this year, it will only add to our inconvenience,” said a final-year BMS student, Paras Shah.
 
 A   said that several colleges had to return the paper bundles as there was a mismatch in allocating assessment work. 
 
 Controller of examination Deepak Wasave said that they are in the process of announcing the results in the next two to three days. “Most assessment work is completed. We will announce the results soon. We will also try to postpone the exam dates for repeaters (ATKT exams) to ensure they get enough time to apply for re-evaluation,” said Wasave.
