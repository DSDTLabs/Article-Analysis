NAGPUR: Good polling was witnessed in the nine municipal councils of the district on Sunday with the average figure being around 73%. Mohpa topped the chart with 85.96% while Kamptee was lowest with 60.17%. Meanwhile, the two municipal councils in Gondia witnessed around 68% polling.

 The average figure for phase four of the council elections is 67.36% as per   (SEC). The counting will be held on Monday and start at 10 am.
 
 The prestige of chief minister  , union transport minister   and guardian minister   is at stake in the elections. Bawankule has been extensively campaigning in the elections with CM Fadnavis devoted two full days to the district. In Gondia, NCP leader Praful Patel needs to win the Gondia and Tiroda councils to arrest the downslide in his political fortunes.
 
 Elections are being held for 186 seats in nine municipal councils of the district. Nine direct elections of council president are also being held after a gap of fifteen years. The polling percentage in the district at 11.30 am was 15.68%, which increased to 48.51% at 3.30 pm.
 
 TOI had visited some of the towns where polling was going on. There was enthusiasm among residents of Ismailpura, Kamptee. As they had vote for multiple candidates, they needed the help of polling agents, who had pitched their tents outside the booths. 
 
 Idris Khan, a Congress polling agent, told TOI that he did not have problem in explaining the process to youngsters and middle-aged people. “However, there was some problem with some old people,” he said. Sheikh Nawab, a local, said that he had exercised his franchise without any problem. In Khapa, residents said that last time they had voted for a panel of five candidates and hence did not have problem with voting for more than one candidate. Same was the case in Saoner. TOI did not find any cases of names missing from electoral polls in the booths it visited.
