PANCHAKULA: The   (HBSE) neither has a counsellor nor a helpline number for students in distress due to poor results in classes X and XII.

 With less than half of the   students failing in the HBSE exams this year, they are depressed and in need of counselling and motivation. The education department admitted that they do not have a counsellor, a psychologist or a helpline number like the   and the ICSE. The psychiatric department of Panchkula civil hospital had received about seven cases for counselling of children before the exams started.
 
 Dr  , in charge of the psychiatric ward, said in a couple of cases the main problem was the working schedule of parents that did not allow them to give attention to their wards. "Parents need to understand their children and they are the ones who can motivate them to study. School authorities should also send report of every student to parents from time to time," he added.
 
 Panchkula district education officer   said she had called a meeting of all headmasters of government schools on Thursday and asked them to identify the reasons of poor results, student's family status and counsel both students as well as parents. Nain said, "We do not have any counsellor or helpline number, but principals and teachers have been asked to take students seriously and improve the weak points ."
