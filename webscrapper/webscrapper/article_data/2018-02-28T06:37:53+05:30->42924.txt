MUMBAI:  ,  , does not have a single   for the community.

 Almost 45 years after a plot was allotted in 1974, the community still has to travel 5 km away to Ambarnath to inter its dead. The authorities there have now signalled reluctance to continue this favour given their own requirements. Powerful builders are reportedly working to get the existing reservation cancelled as their prestigious housing projects nearby could be devalued.
 
 The municipal commissioner says he plans to allot an alternative site, but that is located near an ancient Shiva temple and could cause conflict with local residents. “All other communities have plots to inter their dead. There is a cemetery for animals also. Only we are deprived. A plot labelled Survey No. 58 was demarcated in 1974 and notified in 2006 but has still not been handed over,” local activist Akhlak Khan said.
 
 In 2017, a social worker named Anil Kumar bicycled all the way to New Delhi to highlight this grievance.
 
 “Some months ago the community protested by leading two corpses to the municipal commissionerate and holding a dharna,” Amar Joshi, former secretary,  , said. “Those two bodies were buried in Survey
 
 58. But local residents who were unaware that the plot was demarcated as a graveyard, protested.”
 
 Ulhasnagar municipal commissioner Rajendra Nimbalkar said a few plots had been identified for the Muslim graveyard.
