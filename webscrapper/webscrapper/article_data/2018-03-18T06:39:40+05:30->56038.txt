LUCKNOW: To decongest major roads in the city,   ( ) has devised a strategy to regulate street vending through a fee structure based on business time hours.

 While trying to free space for vehicles on roads that remain encroached by street vendors for most hours of the day, LMC has restricted street vending, putting a cap at eight hours. Now, monthly and annual vending passes will allow vendors to sell wares for eight hours only, and if they want to extend business hours, they will have to pay extra to LMC.
 
  
  
 
 The weekly and seasonal markets that come up around festivals will also now be allowed for eight hours per day, as per the standard fee. If the vendors want to extend their shop timings, they will have to take permission from LMC and pay for extra hours of business. It is the first time that LMC has tried to regulate vending through a fee structure based on timing.
 
 LMC had recently come up with first list of 24 vending zones that will provide permanent vending spots to about 1,500 vendors. With more than 25,000 vendors in city, LMC needs to scout for more places and conduct surveys to identify genuine ones and allocate them fixed selling spots.
 
 As per the decision by town vending committee, LMC has finalized a fee structure for various categories of vendors — fixed, mobile, weekly markets, vendors on the outskirts, mobile food vans etc.
 
 LMC’s standard fee allows vending only for eight hours. LMC will deploy zonal teams to do random surveys of markets and commercial places to ensure that vendors adhere to their timings.
 
 A senior official said, “We have not allocated fixed time for shop. They can begin vending at any time but the fee will only allow them for eight hours, from the moment they start vending. Our teams will keep a check on them. If a vendor wants to extend time, he will have to pay extra fee, at the same rate.”
 
 Vendors who are widow or physically challenged will get 25% rebate in vending fee.
