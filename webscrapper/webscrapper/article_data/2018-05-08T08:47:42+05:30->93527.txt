One is a check button that allows the passenger to ascertain whether the safety device is working and not tampered with when s/he gets into the vehicle. The other is the panic button; on pressing it, the vehicle sets off an alarm to people aroundsothatthey can reach the passenger for help.”

The device has scope to add some more features like inserting a GPRS sim card and sending SMS tothe nearest police station.”
