PATNA: State energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav on Sunday said over 11.5 crore people pay direct or indirect taxes in India with the help of which the country runs in addition to loans taken by the government. “The   is also running on taxpayers’ money,” the minister said at the second national conference on ‘State tribunals in India’ here. Union law and justice minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, IAS officers Tripurari Sharan and K K Pathak were also present.

 “Politicians and bureaucrats are punished if they are found guilty. What about the judiciary?” Yadav asked. He said tribunals have are battling with more pending cases than courts. Even after 70 years of independence, the condition of tribunals is poor in the country,” the minister added.
 
 He also raised the issue of unavailability of accommodation for MLAs and ministers as cases related to occupying government accommodations are pending before the Patna high court. The HC had reserved its order after hearing the matter on February 5 this year.
 
 The minister praised retired IAS officer V S Dubey, who was sitting in the front row, for unearthing multi-crore fodder scam. “You have done a historical job,” Yadav said while turning his eyes to Dubey.
