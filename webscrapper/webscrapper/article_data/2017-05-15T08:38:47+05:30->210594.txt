LUCKNOW: After nearly two months of ‘dry spell’,   of Old City’s iconic joints -- Tunday’s, Raheem’s and Mobeen’s -- are gradually back on the menu. While the Allahabad high court’s order to the state government to issue licences to   and meat shops may not lead to immediate availability of meat, especially buffalo meat used in popular dishes like nihari and kebabs, it certainly has had a positive impact on the sentiments in the market.

 “We started with a small quantity today after procuring the buffalo meat from a legally operated slaughterhouse,” says the owner of a joint. “The high court’s order has given us hope that the end of meat crisis is near and soon we may see a normal supply. That’s why most joints have started making efforts to get back to their old menu, even if it’s gradual and in low quantity,” he adds.
 
 A crackdown on unlicensed slaughterhouses and meat shops was launched in March after BJP government came to power. Since most shops and slaughterhouses were running without licences, or their licences expired on March 31, the supply of mutton and buffalo meat was badly hit. It forced the famous non-vegetarian joints to either shut for the time being or sell improvised delicacies like nihari and kebabs made of chicken.
 
 Speaking to TOI, owner of Tundy Kebabi said that on Sunday he served just a few kg buffalo meat kebab and would start normal supply from Tuesday. However owner of Raheem's who started selling some items made of buffalo meat on Sunday said he would give a break on Tuesday and back to normal pre-March business by Wednesday.
