PATNA: The   (SHS) on Tuesday asked all district magistrates and health officials to implement the Centre’s ‘Prerna’ scheme in order to help push up the age of marriage of girls and space the birth of children in the interest of health of young mothers and infants. The scheme functions under the   (National Population Stabilisation Fund), an autonomous society of the Union ministry of health and family welfare.

 An SHS official said the scheme, which covers only   families, would be implemented in an attempt to curb high fertility rate in the state. “The list of BPL families is ineffective in the state. We have adopted the priority household list of the food and consumer department for the implementation of the scheme,” he added.
 
 The   had been launched by the Centre in 2008 and adopted by the state government in 2009. However, it could not be implemented properly in the state due to a funds crunch.
 
 As per national family health survey (2015-16), 12.2% females in state either became mothers or fell pregnant between the age group 15-19 years, with the majority being married at 17 years of age. Nearly 44.4% women had reported that the time duration between two pregnancies were less than 36 months. As per Family Planning 2020 data, nearly 41% of the population in state has an unmet demand for modern contraceptive. 
 
 In order to become eligible for awards under the scheme, the girls should be married on or after 19 years of age and they should give birth to the first child after at least two years of marriage.
 
 The scheme envisages that the couple will get an award of Rs 10,000 if the first baby born is a boy and Rs 12,000 if the baby born is a girl. If the space between two pregnancies is three years and either parent voluntarily accepts permanent method of family planning within one year of the birth of the second child, the couple will get an additional award of Rs 5,000 (baby boy) and Rs 7, 000 (baby girl).
