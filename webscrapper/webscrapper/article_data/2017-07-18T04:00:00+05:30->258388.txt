Mumbai:   has said that it respects the high court’s order and will pursue its objection to insolvency proceedings and will push its own proposal for restructuring in the National Company Law Tribunal ( ).

 In a statement issued here on Monday, the steelmaker said that its request to the Gujarat high court was that it should have been given time to complete its debt restructuring as it apprehended that referring the company to the   (IBC) at this stage may result in deterioration of the company’s operations and, in fact, may delay the discussion with banks for a resolution.
 
 The request for more time was made in light of the fact that “the company was in advanced stage of discussions with lenders on its debt-resolution proposal, payment of Rs 3,467 crore to banks between April 2016 and June 2017, and substantial improvement in all operating parameters”. The company pointed out that in the judgment, the court has indicated that all of these issues should be considered by the NCLT before taking any decision on merits.
 
 Essar also seems to have found solace in the court order, which stated that it be given reasonable opportunity. “In other words, filing of an application may not result into mechanical admission of application as seen and posed by   in impugned press release. It would be a decision based on judicial discretion by the adjudicating authority to deal with such application in accordance with law and based upon facts, evidence and circumstance placed before it,” the order said.
 
 The Essar statement also highlighted the point in the high court order, which stated that filing in the NCLT would not amount to admitting or allowing the petition for insolvency without offering reasonable opportunity to the company. “Therefore, the adjudicating authority being NCLT herein, which is constituted in place of the company court, needs to decide on its own based upon factual details that whether the insolvency petition is required to be entertained as such or not,” the order said.
