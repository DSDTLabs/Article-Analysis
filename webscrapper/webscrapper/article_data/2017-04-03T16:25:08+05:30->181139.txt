AGARTALA: The Deprived Unemployed Association ( ) on Sunday warned the Left Front government against playing a partisan role with the unemployed in the name of extending special help to 10,323 teachers whose job was terminated by the Supreme Court last week because of illegal and unfair means of appointment. 

 DUA vice-president Anuja Biswas said they had been fighting in the high court and the Supreme Court for the last seven years against gross irregularities and nepotism in teachers' appointment between 2010 and 2014.
