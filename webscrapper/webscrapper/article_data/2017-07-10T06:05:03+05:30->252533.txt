MYSURU: A young couple from Vyalikaval, Malleswaram, believed to be depressed over their families' opposition to their marriage, tried to kill themselves by consuming poison in Sakleshpur taluk of Hassan district on Saturday. While the 23-year-old man died, his 17-year-old lover survived. The two were on their way to get married when they decided to commit suicide instead.

 Chethan, a photographer, and the girl were neighbours and in love for a few years now. Chethan worked in a photo studio while the girl, who had completed Class X, had discontinued her education. Recently, Chethan had told his parents that he wanted to marry the girl but they opposed it. The girl's parents did not approve of the match either.With neither side willing to relent, the couple decided to elope. They decided to get married in Dharmasthala in   district.
 
 On Saturday, they boarded a private cab at 18th Cross Malleswaram and left for the temple town on the banks of river Netravathi. The taxi driver told police that when they reached   in Sakleshpur, Chethan asked him to stop the vehicle as they had to attend nature's call. The driver parked the vehicle on the roadside and the couple entered a woody part in the hilly area.
 
 Apparently, the duo then consumed the poison that they had brought with them. After a few minutes, they returned to the cab and told the driver to proceed. Dharmasthala was still 35km away but the driver soon noticed that Chethan and the girl were in discomfort. He turned the vehicle around and made for the Sakleshpura Government Hospital.
 
 Police said Chethan failed to respond to the treatment and died in the hospital while the girl survived. Her parents were called and they shifted her to a private hospital in Bengaluru. A case has been registered at Sakleshpur Rural police station.
