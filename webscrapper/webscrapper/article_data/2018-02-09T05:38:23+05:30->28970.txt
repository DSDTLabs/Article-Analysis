DHARAMSHALA: Despite the outrage following the video showing a man attacking a   (Deewan Chand), mother (Basanti Devi) and wife ( ) with an axe, the police are unable to arrest the accused seen in the clip.

 The accused (Rattan Chand) was admitted in the   on February 3 as he allegedly hit himself with a brick after attacking the soldier’s family. Head of psychiatry department at the hospital Dr Sukhjeet Singh said, “The accused is suffering from emotional disorder and we have kept him under observation. We cannot discharge him as of now.” Police are waiting for Rattan to be discharged from the hospital so that they can arrest him.
 
 However, the victim family has raised question saying, “The accused is a government employee for the last 20 years. How can he be suffering from an mental disorder? If he is, then why he has never attacked his own family members.”
 
 Sunita Kumari (27), sister of the Army man, who is posted in Srinagar in J&K, has termed it a tactic of the accused. “Rattan Chand is befooling the police to avoid arrest. If he has some emotional disorders then how he can be employed by the government.” She said that the accused was so clever that after attacking her family he went with his wife to hire a taxi and filed a police complaint against them.
 
 “My father had a narrow escape even as his collar bone was split into two. He also received eight stitches. My mother had a fracture in arm and my brother’s wife suffered head injuries in the attack,” added Sunita.
 
 Superintendent of police Santosh Patial said that they were awaiting release of the patient. “We can only arrest him when he gets discharged from the hospital. It is sure that he will be arrested,” he said.
