Mumbai: Main accused in the   case,  , who had moved   for  , withdrew his plea and will approach the sessions court now since a   has been filed in the case. The prosecutor informed the high court that police had filed the chargesheet on September 22 before a magistrate in Vikroli.

 Since a chargesheet signals the end of investigation, Shitap can now move the sessions court again citing a change in circumstances. The accused had moved high court after the trial court had, last month, rejected his plea for bail citing ongoing investigation.
 
 Shitap has been accused of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section 304-II of Indian Penal Code (IPC) which attracts 10 years’ imprisonment.
 
 Shitap’s lawyer Mateen Shaikh had sought time to bring the chargesheet on record, but Justice Revati Mohite-Dere asked him to approach the sessions court, given the change in circumstances. The chargesheet runs into over 2,600 pages. He then withdrew his plea.
 
 Meanwhile, not willing to let Shitap get bail, several residents, including family members of those who lost their lives in the tragedy, had moved an intervention application through advocates Sujay Kantawala and Ashish Mehta, to oppose his demand. They pointed to a high-level BMC inquiry report that indicates Shitap was carrying out “unauthorized’’ construction on his premises, whi-ch weakened the structure.
