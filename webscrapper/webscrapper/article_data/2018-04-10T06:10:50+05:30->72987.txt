HYDERABAD:   of the Hyderabad High Court on Monday stayed the ongoing trial in the encounter killing of Maoist central committee member Azad alias Cherukuri Rajkumar and a journalist before a magistrate court in Adilabad. The judge gave this interim order while hearing four petitions filed by 23 accused policemen in the case.

 Azad and journalist Hemachandra Pandey were killed in an encounter in   of   in Adilabad in July 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
 Azad alias Cherukuri Rajkumar was the spokesperson and one of the seniormost members of the Central Politburo of the banned CPI (Maoist) party.
 
 Padma, wife of Azad and  , the wife of the deceased journalist, filed private complaints before the trial court charging the police of murdering their husbands and urged the court to try the accused police under provisions of law that deal with a murder case. Though the trial court rejected their plea, a district court in Adilabad, upon a revision by the wives of the deceased, on February 15, 2008, directed the trial court to try the accused policemen too.
 
 Subsequently, as the trial court summoned the accused to the court, the police preferred appeals before the HC. Appearing for the accused policemen, senior counsel   told the court that the district court passed its order without hearing the accused. The wivesâ€™ pleas did not make the police as respondents, he said. The judge agreed with the argument that none of the policemen was made a party before the sessions court and stayed all further proceedings including the personal appearance of the accused before the trial court. The case will come up for hearing after two weeks.
