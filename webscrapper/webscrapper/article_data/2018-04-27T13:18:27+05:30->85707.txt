NEW DELHI: Seven   were killed in an encounter with security forces in   district of   on Friday, police told PTI.

 
 A joint squad of Greyhounds -- an elite anti-Naxal unit of the Telangana Police -- and security personnel from Chhattisgarh had launched a combing operation in the forests along the inter-state border following intelligence inputs about presence of Maosits in the area.
 
 When the patrolling team was in Ipenta, located around 500km from the state capital Raipur, an exchange of fire broke out between the two sides. After the guns fell silent, security forces recovered the bodies of seven naxalites, including that of women, from the encounter spot, reported PTI.
 
 The encounter comes close on the heels of a massive counter-offensive against Maoists in Maharashtra's   district last Sunday. 39 naxalites were killed in the operation carried out by C-60 commandos of the   Police. Search for more bodies and weapons is still underway.
 
 On Thursday, 60 Naxal cadres, mostly lower-rung members, surrendered in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur. All these cadres were associated with the outlawed CPI (Maoists) for the past eight years and were mainly tasked with spreading Maoist propaganda, damaging government buildings, attacking police teams and collecting information, a police officer said.
 
 In early March, a team of Greyhounds personnel had swooped on a Naxal camp in Bijapur district as part of a joint operation with the Chhattisgarh Police. Ten Maoists, including seven women, were killed in the operation.
