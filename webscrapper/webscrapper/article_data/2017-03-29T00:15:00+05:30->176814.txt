Indore: Indore municipal corporation (IMC) has planned to change old drinking water and sewerage pipelines in   area.

 IMC officials said that around Rs 300 crore will be spent on the project. 
 
 “We are planning to carry out development work under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) Yojana,” said IMC commissioner Manish Singh. 
 
 Authorities concerned said that detailed project report on development work by civic body is expected to come by next month. 
 
 While Rs 300 crore would be spent in the Smart City development area, Rs 900 crore will be spent under AMRUT Yojana to improve condition of pipelines in the entire city. The civic body is planning to raise Rs180 crore through bonds. 
 
 “The present system of water pipelines in the city was designed in 1978.The average age of a pipeline system is 30 years. The pipelines in the city have completed their life cycle, so the problems keep coming up,” an IMC official said. 
 
 The civic body is planning to link the city’s water tanks and pipes with hydraulic modelling and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), which will allow it to stop overhead tanks from overflowing and leakages in feeder and distribution lines. A control room is being set up for the purpose. 
 
 “For the first time a proper ‘water strategy’ has been included in town planning. Hydraulic modelling76 will help IMC to collect comprehensive data about the flow of water into feeder and distribution pipelines,” Singh told TOI.
 
 The civic body has also prepared a plan to increase the water supply in the city to 540 MLD. IMC’s water work department head Balram Verma said that they will spend a total of Rs 7 crore on the project.
 
 Two new water treatment plants would be set up in the city, said officials.
