CHANDIGARH: In order to beautify a stretch in  , the municipal corporation had decided to plant flowers inside the specially designed kyaris. However, the work was never completed and now these kyaris lie unattended. One can spot plastic waste near the kyaris now.

 From the edge of the first row of shops in Sector 17-A opposite the parking lot to the next block of shops, specially designed steps along with different formations of kyaris were constructed by the   in order to make the market complex look beautiful.
 
 However, just after a few weeks of planting different flower saplings into the kyaris, the work came to an abrupt halt and never resumed. “This market area has been left neglected for a very long time now. These circular kyaris were constructed of red bricks and cement. Since no one took care of these plantations, this place has now been covered with plastic waste. Residents throw wrappers of eatables, plastic cups and polythene waste here,” said Sandeep Chopra, a nearby shop owner.
 
 Nearly 20 kyaris of different shapes and sizes have been now infested with overgrown  , unwanted low-lying and creeping vegetation, which add to the grim spectacle of these surroundings. “No one really cared enough to complete the work of flowers here over the years. However, a few weeks back, the MC did a little cement repairing job here,” said Shubham Mittal, a supervisor of a nearby shop.
 
 In the meantime, despite repeated attempts, officials of the concerned department of the MC were unavailable for comment.
