NEW DELHI: Five months after the Nirbhaya incident in Delhi, a 15-year-old blind girl stepped out to relieve herself in the dead of night in her village on the Konark-Puri highway on June 5, 2013. 

 A local taxi driver, who knew her, kidnapped, raped and killed her by inserting an iron rod in her private parts. She bled to death and her body was discovered in the morning.
 
 The similarity between the Nirbhaya incident and the rape-murder of the blind girl is striking. But everything else is very different. 
 
 The Nirbhaya trial has reached finality with the   upholding death penalty to all four found guilty. The   is yet to be completed in a Puri sessions court.
 
 Nirbhaya’s parents were granted Rs 15 lakh as compensation. In Odisha, the candles lit for the blind minor girl, who went to a school for visually challenged, failed to move the state government, whose legal aid services authority felt awarding Rs 1.5 lakh compensation to her parents was enough.
 
 A PIL was filed in the   high court. More than a year after the incident, the HC found that the state legal services authority had decided to pay Rs 1.5 lakh compensation to the parents, but handed over only half of it.
 
 An advocate in the SC, Radhakanta Tripathy, repeatedly moved the   attempting to get higher compensation to the girl’s parents.
 
 He told TOI, “There is no benchmark for compensation to families facing identical trauma. 
 
 Nirbhaya’s parents got handsome compensation and loads of sympathy. But for parents of a blind minor girl who was murdered like Nirbhaya, justice is a far cry. ”
