HYDERABAD: Failure of the   to implement sections of Municipal Corporate Act to regulate   in public places, including commercial complexes has come to the fore again. 

 An advocate from   has written to   commissioner seeking action against those collecting parking fee at commercial complexes, malls and multiplexes. Commissioner of police VV Srinivasa Rao has instructed traffic cops to work on the issue.
 
 Advocate K Ravalee, in her letter written to the Commissioner of Police, said the shopping complexes malls, theatres and commercial buildings are levying parking fees ranging from 20-30 for four wheelers and 10-20 for two-wheelers on an hourly basis. 
 
 According to Section 115 of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act 1955, the corporate can levy fees on the use of parking space provided to the public. But, as per Section 2(44) of the HMC Act, the commercial complexes are public places by the nature of activities that take place at these locations.
 
 "Commercial complex owners have no authority under the act to impose and collect fees from the public. According to rule 12 of the Multi-Storeyed Building Rules 1981 and zoning regulation of GO number 423, it is mandatory for owners of commercial complexes to provide regular parking facility to visitors at free of cost. These complexes shall use them as commercial ventures and make money out of them," Ravalee wrote to the commissioner.
 
 The high court had earlier ruled that collection of parking fees by the owners of commercial complexes was illegal. Despite the act and high court judgement, owners of the business complexes are still collecting parking fees, showing disregard for the rules
 
 "We are taking up the issue in coordination with the GHMC," Traffic DCP A V   said.
