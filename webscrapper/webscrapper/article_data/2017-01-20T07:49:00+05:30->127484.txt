Shimla: On Friday, Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) will hold its Special Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Dharamshala to discuss the implementation of Lodha panel recommendations besides electing its new president.

 Since Anurag Thakur cannot continue as HPCA president following the Lodha panel guidelines, his younger brother Arun Dhumal or former Ranji captain Vikram Rathore is likely to be elected for the post during the meeting.
 
 HPCA has 12 office-bearers, out of which 11 are not eligible to continue as they have completed the tenure of nine years or more. Arun is not an AHPCA office-bearer at present but he has not played any Ranji match which could go against him, sources said.
 
 Despite playing for HP for a short while, Rathore may also find himself ineligible for contest since he was born in Jalandhar, Punjab, and he doesn’t have a state domicile.
 
 HPCA sources said that the special AGM is being held to implement the Lodha panel report. They added that even Anurag would have to sit out as he is heading HPCA for last around 16 years. 
 
 It was in the year 2000 when Anurag had became the HPCA president first time at an age of 25. In Himachal, he is credited to have made cricket popular even in remote corners of the state and turned the fortunes of the state cricket body from a fund starved organization to a cash rich body.
 
 Since its formation in 1960, HPCA has seen only four presidents - Sardar Preetpal Singh, Rajinder Zar, Raghubir Singh Thakur and Anurag Thakur. Anurag has not only held the president’s post for the longest term but also faced no opposition in the association so far.
