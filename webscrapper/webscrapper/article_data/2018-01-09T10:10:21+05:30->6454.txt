SILCHAR: The   on Monday brought out a protest rally here against the absence of a large number of names from the first draft of the   ( ), particularly in   areas. Led by Silchar MP and   president  , the rally marched through the main streets of the town and then staged a dharna in front of the office of the deputy commissioner (Cachar). 

 Addressing the rally, Dev said, "The names of as many as 24 lakh people from Barak Valley are absent from the first draft of the NRC which was published on midnight of December 31. A total of 41 lakh people across three districts of the Valley had applied for inclusion in the registry. It has come to our notice that not only Bengalis, but also a large number of tea folk, have not featured in the draft."
 
 Dev added that people of Barak Valley, irrespective of allegiance, will fight any design to exclude people from the NRC on the basis of language or religion. "We want to see that no genuine Indian is left out of NRC. Otherwise the Congress will launch a vigorous agitation across Barak Valley," said Dev.
 
 Dev said Bengalis have been living in Assam, and Barak Valley in particular, well before 1874 when Cachar became part of the state of Assam. "It is my humble request that this process of updating the NRC should not create two classes of citizens in India. Bengalis should be considered original inhabitants as they have stayed here right from the 14th and 15th centuries," she said.
 
 Former minister Ajit Singh and Silchar district Congress president Pradip Kumar Dey were among those who also addressed the rally.
