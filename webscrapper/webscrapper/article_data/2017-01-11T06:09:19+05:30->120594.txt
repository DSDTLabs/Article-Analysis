CHENNAI: The XI special   for bank fraud cases in Chennai on Tuesday granted two days policy custody of mining baron J   and his associates V Srinivasalu and auditor  .

 The trio was produced in the court last Friday after two days CBI custody, following which they were remanded in judicial custody. The judge adjourned the matter on Tuesday.
 
 Arguing for police custody, counsel for CBI said that while people were facing difficulties in securing the new currency notes, Reddy and his associates were in possession of huge quantities of new currency notes. So further investigation was required to identify the people involved in the illegal conversion. Around 5.30 pm, judge K Venkataswamy granted two days police custody of Reddy.
 
 Earlier, the CBI had registered a case against the three in connection with seizure of Rs 8 crore from the residence of Reddy in T Nagar.
 
 Meanwhile, CBI also sought custody of Reddy’s other associates   and Muthupettai Ramachandran — who had been remanded in judicial custody till January 17 — for seven days. The judge, however, denied police custody of the duo.
 
 The CBI had filed a FIR against Reddy, Srinivasalu, Premkumar, Dindigul Rathinam and Muthupettai Ramachandran for illegal conversion of currencies worth Rs 34 crore. It named unknown bank officials and public servants as suspects in the case. Later, Kolkatta based realtor   was named as the sixth accused. 
 
 The accused were then booked under sections 13(1) and (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA). They are also facing charges for offences under IPC including criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy.
