PANAJI: A day after the   (MGP) refused to state its stand on the medium of instruction issue, alliance partner Shiv Sena reiterated that the Mahayuti of Shiv Sena, MGP and   (GSM) is still intact. 

 “Every party has its own manifesto, even when they’re in an alliance. There may be some minor difference of opinion on certain issues and   is in a better position to answer why MGP has not addressed the MoI issue,” Shiv Sena’s   MP Sanjay Raut said. 
 
  “BJP had 21 MLAs in the assembly and that means a total majority in a 40-seat assembly. How many more seats do they need to develop the state? If the Prime Minister is unaware of such a fact, then it is an insult to the people of Goa,” Raut said.
 
  “It needs to be checked if the people who attended the rally were actually from Goa or not. I was told that there was huge traffic coming from Karnataka side and many buses came from that side,” Raut said.
