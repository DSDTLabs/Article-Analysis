Amritsar: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ( ) chief secretary   had cancelled the committee’s earlier directions to managers of the SGPC-run gurdwaras to provide suitable places in the gurdwara complexes for putting up advertisements of the film.

 As the anger of Sikhs spilled on roads against the controversial movie ‘Nanak Shah Fakir,’ a letter by SGPC chief secretary written to all managers of gurdwaras “with respect to cancellation of circular” went viral on Thursday. Written on March 29, the letter reads that an earlier circular issued on March 19, 2018 should not be implemented.
 
 On March 19, Singh had written to the managers of all the gurdwaras under the management of the SGPC to arrange and provide appropriate sites in the complexes for putting up advertisements of the movie. The March 29 letter reads that the circular was issued after receiving a copy of a no objection certificate which, in turn, was given on the basis of a sub-committee report.
 
 Earlier on March 13, SGPC chief secretary had shot off another letter to the committee’s director (education) instructing him to ensure that maximum number of students should see the movie made on the life and teachings of Guru  , said sources.
 
 However, Roop Singh couldn’t be contacted despite several attempts.
