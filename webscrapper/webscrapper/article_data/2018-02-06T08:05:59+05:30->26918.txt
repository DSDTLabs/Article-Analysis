PURANDAR: Kamal Datta Galange vividly remembers the villagers’ struggle in the 1970s to develop the dry land of Purandar, the site of the proposed international airport. 

 “The area was without much water. For farmers like us, survival was a challenge. But we did not think think of any alternative profession. We fought hard and scripted a success story on some plots. How can we think of giving away our land now,” said the woman in her early sixties. 
 
 As TOI spoke to a number of villagers at Pargaon in Purandar taluka, they mostly shared Galange’s views. But the biggest concern is the number of villagers by their side. “If one takes the total strength of all seven villages, it is close to around 23,000 people, including teenagers and children. Purandar has around 1.5 lakh. We need support from people in villages that may not be affected now,” a villager said.

The only boost was the presence of a large number of  . “They with a big banner, stating that they will fight against the   Less than 1% of the people here have ever boarded an aircraft. How can the airport be beneficial for us?” Pargaon sarpanch Sarjerao Memane said.
 
 Ganesh Somnath Jagtap, who runs an organisation, Balliraja Shetkari Sangha, said, “The government is talking about land acquistion at seven villages. They can expand the project later and acquire land in other villages as well.”
 
 “We don’t want to give our land. Our kids are not educated. If our land goes, they will have to sweep floors at the airport for survival,” MNS leader   said.
