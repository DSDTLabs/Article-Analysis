PANAJI: The premises of the   Society of Goa transformed into a robotics playground on Thursday. Over 100 children participated in the ‘build-a-thon’ robotics competition as part of the Science Film Festival of India, 2018.

 Over 40 teams from around the country participated, six of them from Goa. The teams were given building material and equipment to construct a line follower robot — one that follows either a black line in a white area or a white line in a black area. Four tracks were laid out inside the ESG gallery for participants to test their robots.
 
 “We are confident about the robot that we have built and are excited to be a part of this competition.” said  , a student of  . “Goa needs more of such competitive events.”
 
 Operating robots through laptops was just one of several activities that let youngsters showcase their knowledge of robotics at the competition.
 
 “The light sensors are supposed to follow the various coloured lights and move forward accordingly. We have an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection which will help the robot move in a proper line,” said  , a student of SRS International School, Greater Faridabad.
 
 Satvik Duggal, a Class V student from Ludhiana-based Satpaul  , said, “We have used a simple design. Our robot can get up and complete the task even if it falls off the track.”
