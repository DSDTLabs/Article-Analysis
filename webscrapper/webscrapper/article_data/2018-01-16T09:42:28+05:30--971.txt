SHIMLA: Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and former chief minister   have locked horns over issues of poor financial condition of the state, poor law and order situation in the state under the previous regime and unemployment allowance scheme started by   government. 

 Reacting to Thakur’s statement on Sunday at Tattapani, that Congress’s unemployment allowance decision had not paid the party in assembly elections. He had also accused the previous Congress government of burdening the state with a Rs 46,500 crore debt, and that law and order was in complete disorder under the previous regime. 
 
 Virbhadra hit back at the CM on Monday, saying he should focus on the development of state and stop misleading the people on the issue of employment. He said the Congress regime had provided employment to over 70,000 youth and trained around 1.5 lakh youths through Skill Development Corporation. He accused the CM of wanting to discontinue with unemployment allowance and issuing baseless statements.
 
 Maintaining that law and order was under control under his regime, the former CM said that he had taken the initiative to hand over the Gudiya case to CBI. Clarifying on the Rs 46,500 crore debt burden on state, he said the Congress regime had inherited the financial loss from the previous   regime. He said that previous BJP government headed by Prem Kumar Dhumal had provided wrong figures to the 13th financial commission, which resulted in financial loss to the state.
 
 “Despite this, my government did not let development suffer. Crores were spent on basic needs like education, health and drinking water ,” he said.   also accused the Prime Minister   led NDA government of not giving any financial assistance to Himachal and also accused the BJP leaders at centre of blocking developmental schemes.
