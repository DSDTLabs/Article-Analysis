Through social media, a fake alert on hartal in various parts of Kerala has been circulating, for the past few days. Reports have also been coming in stating that in certain areas, even vehicles have been stopped, for holding protests seeking justice for the victim of a recent case of assault. 

 Actress Parvathy, who had recently won a National Award, has raised her voice against it through her social media page. She wrote, "Hooliganism in the name of protest! Roads blocked and people abused on roads from Calicut airport- Chemmad- Kodinji-Tanur. Please pass the message and stay safe! The police force has been intimated and they are making arrests I hear. Please share updates here."
 
 Many have been replying to her, mentioning various other areas which faced similar issues in the State.
