 Recently, the corporation started a construction work to establish a microcompost yard in a place in Rani Meiyammal Nagar in ward 37.

Besides, there is a school situated at a distance of 200m from the proposed compost yard, in which about 2000 students are studying. 
 
 When there is no people’s representation (councillor) in the ward due to absence of local body elections, the corporation has chosen the place without consulting the locals. In November, the residential associations functioning in and around the place started ventilating grievances to the corporation. When the issue was taken to the district collector, he assured to take steps to shift the place and also advised to approach the corporation commissioner. The corporation conducted a zonal meeting for the issue. 
 
 The corporation commissioner said that compost yard project was a central government-sponsored scheme for the welfare of the people and there would be no health hazards to the public. He also asked the public to visit other places where the compost yards are functioning.
