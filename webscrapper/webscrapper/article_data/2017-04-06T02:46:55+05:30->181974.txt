NEW DELHI: If   fails to file the   in the US woman gang rape case on the next occasion, it will have to explain the delay, a   said on Wednesday while granting another adjournment plea. 

 The prosecution had sought time earlier too, saying the forensic science laboratory (FSL) of Hyderabad is yet to send the report. The case will be heard again on May 8, said the complainantâ€™s lawyer, Sameep Vijayvergiya. 
 
 Aniruddha Singh, a Rajasthan-based tourist guide who is an accused in the case, earlier moved a discharge plea arguing that the entire case is based on the statement given by the survivor under CrPC 164. Defence lawyers have also said she did not lodge the complaint immediately and the FIR was filed eight months after the alleged rape. 
 
 The survivor is ready to come to India to depose, her lawyer had told the court. In October 2016, the police started an investigation after receiving an email from a US-based NGO about the alleged gang rape. During her trip to India, she was allegedly drugged and gang-raped.
