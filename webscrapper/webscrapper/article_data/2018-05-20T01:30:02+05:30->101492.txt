GHAZIABAD: Three persons were arrested following a tip-off on Friday for allegedly cheating people via fake   schemes. The accused have been identified as Raj Mandal, who is from West Bengal,   Haq and Abrar, both from Bihar. Police said Nasirul is wanted by the Bihar police in similar cases. The mastermind  , a cloth dealer and a resident of   in Delhi, is absconding.

 
 According to police, they duped hundreds of people of crores of rupees across the country through this fraudulent mean. “The accused lured unsuspecting victims by posing as officials of lottery schemes and informing them that they had won huge amounts in lucky draws. Once people fell into their trap, they were duped on the pretext of depositing some percentage of the prize money as a charge to claim it,” they added.
 
 Police have recovered 266 ATM cards, 38 PAN cards, seven Aadhaar cards, two voter ID cards, one swipe machine, three mobile phones, several passbooks and Rs 36,500 in old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.
 
 They were caught on Friday around 2am from Sector 3,   following a tipoff.
 
 Talking about the gang’s modus operandi, circle officer, Indirapuram, Dharmendra Singh Chauhan said, “The accused used to procure phone number of people from call centres and other such sources and make random calls on a daily basis. They claimed to earn Rs 3.5 lakh per day through this means. They also claimed to have various bank accounts for this purpose. We are verifying these facts. However, the role of some bank officials in this scam cannot be ruled out.”
 
 “Many of the ATM cards do not have names on them and seem fake. Same goes for PAN and Aadhar cards. They might have been procured through fake identity proofs,” he added.
