LUCKNOW: It is apparently lack of awareness in both patients and medical professionals, specially in rural areas, that inflammatory bowel diseases ( ) like  's disease and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) are on the rise. 

 This reflected in a survey conducted by the gastroenterology department of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) under Prof Uday C  . Of the 3,000 people surveyed in three villages of  , it was found that 22% people suffered from stomach related disorders, but only 17% consulted a doctor. 
 
 "Among these 17% people in the villages of Chhapra, Basti Bandgaon and Molanapur, 5% went for homeopathy, 3% to modern allopathy medicine, 8% to Ayurveda and 1% for Unani treatment. But, due to lack of awareness about the two chronic IBD, many people who get blood in their faeces are operated for piles instead. They consult a specialist when the case gets out of hand and the severity of the disease has increased," said Prof Ghoshal. As per prof Ghoshal, patients of IBD should stay away from the intake of tobacco and tobacco related products because nicotine damages the intestines and the medicine's effectiveness. He added that popping painkillers for everything affects the intestines adversely. "The intake of turmeric, however, helps in treatment of bowel diseases," he said.
 
 
 SGPGIM’s gastroenterology department will soon be starting faecal transplantation for treatment of Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Experts claim, this would make SGPGIMS the first centre to be doing so in Lucknow. “The stool of a healthy person is transferred through colonoscopy into the gastrointestinal tract of a patient with UC for treatment of the disease. We will begin the transplant in two months,” said Prof UC Ghoshal.
