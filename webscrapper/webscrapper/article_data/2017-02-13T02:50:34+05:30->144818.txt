NOIDA: The main accused in the Rs 3,700 crore  , Anubhav Mittal, had floated nearly 20 bogus companies which existed only on papers. According to Ram Kumar, inspector general of police, UP-STF, the accused had also revealed that there was no revenue generation model in the   scheme and only investors’ money was used for disbursement. Kumar visited the STF office in Noida on Sunday.

 It also came to light that Anubhav had hired some people who had previously worked with some other   schemes. The police are investigating it and also the role of those involved in the scam, Kumar said. 
 
 “The STF teams visited the registered addresses of the 20 companies floated by Anubhav, but did not find anything there,” he said.
 
 The investigators found that the accused had also made an uneven disbursement of money to the investors. “We found that some select persons had around 100 IDs. They were also favoured disproportionately. But other investors’ return was stopped. The accused deliberately opened their own IDs and made huge transactions,” he said. 
 
 On Sunday, the city police registered one more FIR against Anubhav Mittal, his wife Ayushi Mittal and a third associate Chandrasekhar in the Ponzi scam case. The case has been registered at Phase III police station on the basis of a complaint filed by a Gurgaon resident, Surendra Sehrawat. Two FIRs have already been registered against the accused, one in Surajpur and the other in Phase III police station.
 
 Kumar said that the accused, Anubhav Mittal, admitted that he was going on the wrong direction and he had planned to launch intmaart.com, an e-commerce website, to escape from dubious business.
 
 STF officials said that Income Tax, Enforcement Directorate, Reserve Bank of India and other organisations are working in coordination in the case.
