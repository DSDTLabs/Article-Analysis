WASHINGTON: The execution date of the first death-row   convicted of killing a baby and her Indian grandmother has been set for next month.

 Raghunandan Yandamuri, 32, in 2014 was given   for kidnapping and killing a 61-year-old elderly Indian woman and her 10-month grand-daughter.
 
 It was seen as part of a botched kidnapping-forransom plot. Yandamuriâ€™s execution date has been set for February 23 by local correctional authorities. However, he is likely to get a reprieve because of a 2015 moratorium on death penalty by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf.
 
 Yandamuri is the first Indian-American to face death penalty.   alleged that killings were part of a botched kidnapping-for-ransom plot.
 
 A native of Andhra Pradesh, Yandamuri had come to the US on a H-1B visa. He holds an advanced   and computer science engineering. Following his conviction, he asked that death penalty be imposed upon him. Later he appealed his sentence, but lost his appeal last April.
