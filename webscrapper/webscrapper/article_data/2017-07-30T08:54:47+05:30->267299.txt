COIMBATORE: The MRFFMSCI Indian   (INRC) returns in a bigger and better format this season with MRF Rally of Coimbatore here on Sunday. Thirty-two cars will be in fray in the opening round which will be held at the Kethanur village some 40 km from here.

 This time, with the addition of one more round in  , the competition will have six rounds in all giving it a more pan-Indian look.
 
 All the leading drivers of the country will be in fray with Team Mahindra's   and   renewing their old rivalry. However, defending champion Karna Kadur, who is with a new team ( ), cannot be counted out.
 
 The cars will have to negotiate five very fast and technical gravel road stages which constitute 71.40 km of the 200 km rally.
 
 Last year's champion here, Ghosh, however, looks a bit rusty having being out of action for seven months. “I am returning to my car after seven months. So I have set myself a modest target. My main aim is to get my rhythm back for the season ahead,” the Kolkata-based driver said.
 
 Gill, who failed to finish here last time after his car developed a mechanical snag, is determined to make amends. He agreed that the last INRC season didn't go well for him. “Yes it was not the best of INRCs for me as I missed out on points in some rounds. But this time with special gravel tyres and good preparation, I expect good results,” the two-time Asia Pacific Rally Championship (APRC) winner stated.
 
 However, doing away with the Indian Rally Championship (IRC) and introduction of new step-up cars is expected to add more zeal to the contest.
