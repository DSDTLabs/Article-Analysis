CHANDIGARH: Satwinder, a resident of  , had to leave her house a few months ago due to   following a   in the   ground nearby. She stayed with a relative in Mohali and returned after a few days. Satwinder now keeps all the doors and windows of her house closed 24X7 in a futile effort to block the foul smell emanating from the dump. The all-pervading stench has made her and her family's life miserable. 

 When TOI visited the locality on Wednesday, residents lamented that the garbage dumping ground has adversely affected their health, with many of them suffering from severe respiratory problems due to the stench and smoke. 
 
 Not only Satwinder, but hundreds of residents residing near the garbage dumping ground are living a wretched existence. "When we bought this house in 1996, the area in front of our house was vacant. But in the past eight to ten years, it has been filled to overflowing with garbage," Satwinder told TOI. 
 
 Ram Karan, who retired from the government college in Sector 11 and lives in the same locality, said, "It has made our lives hell. We have to keep the doors and windows of our houses closed all the time. We can't walk, sit, talk to people or conduct any normal activity outside our houses. No government official or health department team has ever visited this area to know about the inhumane conditions in which we have been forced to survive." 
 
 Meena Devi, another resident, said, "I have developed severe respiratory problems because of living here. We have small kids, and their health is being affected too."
 
 Also, flies were seen hovering around in large numbers in almost all areas of the colony. Locals said the health department has never shown any concern about the issue, let alone spray the area to control the flies.
