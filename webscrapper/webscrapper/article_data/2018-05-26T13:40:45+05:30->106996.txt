Sandalwood actor   has recalled his association with   television host   who died in a car accident on Thursday. Chetan has appreciated the rich knowledge Chandan had possessed about Kannada literature. 
 
  Chetan's post reads. “ Back in Feb, 2009, I had a special tv interview on a Kannada music channel—the interview was regarding a film of mine, ‘Birugaali,’ that had just released. Along with bringing up points on the movie, I had an opportunity to speak on Kannada’s literary icons such as Kuvempu & Shivaram Karanth and their dreams for a secular, inclusive society. The thoughtful questioning from the anchor was what evoked such responses from me; that anchor who asked the questions was Chandan. I always treasured that interview because of its intellectual content made possible by the cognizant & articulate Chandan. A couple nights ago, Chandan (34) passed away in a car accident. We will all miss you, my friend. In the short time we interacted, you made each of us a better person, Chandan. Thank you.Ahimsa.”
  
  Currently, Chetan is shooting for the movie Ranamma, in which he plays the role of a freedom fighter.
