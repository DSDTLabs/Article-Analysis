NEW DELHI:   has not let five-year-old Vihaan out of her sight even for a moment after his rescue. “I will always be grateful to the cops for giving me back my world,” said the relieved mother. The Guptas haven’t had a proper meal since January 25, when the tot was kidnapped from a school van, but there’s a celebratory party coming up.

 Recalling the 12-day  , father Sunny Gupta said everyone stood still whenever the phone rang. “A female voice always coldly demanded delivery of the ransom,” the moist-eyed Gupta told TOI. On January 29, the abductors sent a Whatsapp video. “Obviously, my son was forced to speak in it and through tears, kept saying, ‘I love you papa’ in a sad tone,” Gupta said.
 
 As the ransom negotiations dragged on, the family presumed the worst. “Then I got a call from   on Tuesday, asking me to come to  ,” said Seeta Rani. “Praying my son was safe, I reached the hospital within minutes with my brother-in-law. We found Vihaan sitting with a policeman.” Vihaan ran and clung on to his weeping mother. “He wiped my tears as I hugged him,” she said. Apparently, the thing the kid had asked of his rescuers was to be taken to his  .
 
 When the boy reached home, the pet golden retriever, lying morose in Vihaan’s absence, jumped up happily. Vihaan, his sister, Pari, and the dog had a long group hug. Pari, who saw Vihaan being bundled off by his abductors, was in trauma after the incident. “She often wakes up at night calling out for Vihaan,” said Hunny, Gupta’s brother. The family will send the boy to his grandfather’s house in Nangloi. “We will not send the children to school until the situation normalises,” said Hunny.
