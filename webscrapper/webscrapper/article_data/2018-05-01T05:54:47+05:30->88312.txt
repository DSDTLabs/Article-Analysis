MUMBAI: Looking at the growing number of hawkers taking over footpaths in  , the   has sent notices to five corporate parks in the area, asking them to make provisions for reasonably priced food within their premises so that office employees don't have to patronise street vendors. In just a few years, the number of food vendors has gone up several times in Lower Parel, leading to a rise in civic violations such as cooking on the streets. In the same duration, the area has seen a boom in commercial office space. 

 The civic body's G-South ward, in a letter to Kamala Mills, Apollo Mills, Mafatlal Mills, Century Mills and Synergy IT Park, has directed their managements to ensure that provisions to serve food are made within their premises for corporate houses. The letter reads, "It is observed that employees of every cadre working in corporate offices depend on street food available during lunch hours as hotels in these offices are expensive and beyond their reach. This has given rise to unauthorized vendors selling articles on footpaths outside premises during lunch hours."
 
 The assistant municipal commissioner of G-South ward, Devendra Kumar Jain, confirmed the notice. 
 
 The letter also mentions that the encroachment department of G-South ward has taken repeated action at such spots to prevent the cooking and selling of food on footpaths, but such activity has not reduced. Civic staff complain of opposition to their hawker-clearing action from people working in offices on redeveloped mill land, who say they have no alternatives for their meals. They say they come from far-off places and usually leave home early to reach their workplaces on time and therefore cannot carry tiffin boxes.
