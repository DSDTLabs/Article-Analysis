MUMBAI: Political parties are finding it tough to find and field candidates in reserved wards in posh localities, leading to fewer number of people in the fray from the areas. 

 At 3, Bandra's Pali Hill (electoral ward number 100), Powai's Chandivli and Chembur, all of which are reserved for OBC women, have the lowest number of candidates. Only the mainstream parties-Sena, Congress and BJP-have managed to find candidates for the three wards.
 
 In Pali Hill, Congress has nominated Karen D'mello, who is a sitting corporator from Bandra. D'mello's ward has gone into open category after delimitation and the party has shifted her to the neigbouring ward number 100. The BJP has given a ticket to   from Chandivli ward number 158. "Less number of candidate means less division of votes. But her husband said, "It will be tough fight."
 
 Meanwhile, eleven electoral wards-eight reserved for OBC, two for ST and one for general category women-have found only four candidates each. Three of these wards are located in the tony Malabar Hill.
 
 In contrast, electoral ward number 164 (Sakinaka slums area), a general ward, has the most number of candidates (36) this time.
 
 "Several people are trying their luck in the elections without doing any work for locals. All the gutters in the area are overflowing since long but no one has the time to pay any attention to that. I am working with the people since the past three months. I am sure that people will vote for work and not the name. Division of votes is expected due to the large number of candidates," said one of the contenders from the ward, Chaudhary Ramzan Ali. He is contesting from a new party, Awami Vikas Party.
 
 Ward number 166 is followed by 155 (Mahul village in Chembur), where there are 28 contenders. Appa Avchare, who has got a ticket from  , an alliance partner of the BJP, said, "Our constituency comprises many slums. It is a challenging fight."
