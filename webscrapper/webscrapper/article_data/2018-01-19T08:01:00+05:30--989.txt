Noida: The   at a   in Noida’s Sector 63, in which a   was shot dead on January 14, was planned by a former guard who had been sacked two years ago, police have learnt after arresting three of the alleged mastermind’s accomplices.

 The three persons who were picked up from near the Kala Pathar Underpass on Wednesday night were identified as Bhola (23), Sunil Singh (35) and Ranjit Verma (21). Satyendra, the former guard who had allegedly planned the robbery, is on the run along with an accomplice, Anmol.
 
 Arun Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police Noida (city), said Satyendra had worked as a security guard in Kimo Clothing Design Concept in Sector 63 and was removed by the management two years ago for his unruly behaviour. Police sources said Satyendra had been unhappy with the factory owner after losing the job and wanted to take a revenge on him. 
 
 On January 14, Satyendra and the others arrived at the factory and asked Ashutosh Kumar, the guard on duty, to come out, the police said. Ashutosh did not suspect any foul play as Satyendra was known to him.
 
  According to the police, the gang of five had a drink with Ashutosh. 
 
 Fearing the guard on duty might reveal their identities, the five tied the hands and legs of Ashutosh and shot him dead, apparently on the directions of Satyendra.
 
 A team from the Sector 58 police station that arrested the trio found two .315 guns, 10 bullets and Rs 6.68 lakh from their possession.
