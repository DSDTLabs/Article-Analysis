NEW DELHI:   supremo   today asserted that he continues to be his party's national president, and that his son   is only the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.

 He also said his brother   continues to head SP's Uttar Pradesh unit.
 
 "I am the national president of Samajwadi Party and Akhilesh Yadav is (only) the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Shivpal Yadav is still the president of Samajwadi Party's Uttar Pradesh unit," Mulayam said.
 
 Earlier this month, an emergency convention of SP members called by Rajya Sabha MP 
  , and proposed to remove Shivpal Yadav as the SP's chief in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 Mulayam today said the meeting called by Ram Gopal was unconstitutional, since he'd been 
  .
 
 "Ramgopal Yadav was expelled from the party for six years on 30 December, 2016. Therefore the party's national convention called by him on 1 January, 2017 was illegal," Mulayam said.
 
 Mulayam's assertion that he's the head of the SP, comes at a time when two factions - one headed by him, and the other headed by Akhilesh - have been engaged in a public tussle over the party's name and its election symbol - the cycle - ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls.
 
 Tomorrow is the deadline set by the Election Commission for both the sides to submit documents, before it decides which faction's claim is genuine.
 
 Yesterday, the Akhilesh faction gave the EC affidavits that it claimed had been signed by 90 per cent of legislators and delegates, including over 200 of the 229 MLAs backing the Uttar Pradesh CM.
 
 Mulayam, on his part, is likely to visit the Election Commission (EC) tomorrow to claim the party's name and symbol.
