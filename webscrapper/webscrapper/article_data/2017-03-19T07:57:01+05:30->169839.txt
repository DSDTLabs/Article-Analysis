HYDERABAD:   authorities on Saturday sacked two Class IV employees, P Venkat Ratnam and S Mahendra Bai, following an inquiry into the Friday's incident where a 40-year-old injured man was allegedly denied a wheel-chair at the state-run hospital. 

 The incident triggered an outrage after a video of the injured man, Raju, pushing himself on a child's tricycle went viral. The Begumpet resident had reportedly been semi-paralysed after suffering an electric shock in August. 
 
 Soon after the news spread, Gandhi Hospital authorities ordered an inquiry into the issue. 
 
 "The inquiry found that the two outsourced employees are guilty of denying wheelchair to Raju. Therefore, we have terminated their services with immediate effect," said Dr Manjula, in-charge superintendent of Gandhi Hospital. 
 
 According to officials, the two outsourced employees were removed based on the   and the description given by Raju's wife Santoshi.
 
 Meanwhile, following enquires by governor E S L Narasimhan on the wheelchair row with state health minister C Laxma Reddy and director of health and medical education Dr M Ramani, a report on the same was submitted to him on Saturday. 
 
 "During our interaction with the governor, we informed him that once Raju is admitted to the hospital on Monday, his wife Santoshi will be asked to identify the ward boys. Apart from the terminated employees, if Santoshi identifies the ward boys (and others) who are involved in the case, similar action will be initiated against them," said Ramani. 
 
 Dismissing the suspension of two outsourced employees as an eyewash, Narasimha, an in-patient, said top brass of the hospital should be held accountable for the mess in the premier medical facility and corrective measures should be taken on war-footing.
