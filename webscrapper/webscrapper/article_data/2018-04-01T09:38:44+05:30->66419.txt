BHOPAL: In order to curb age fraud organisers of U-15 cricket tournament the organisers have made   mandatory for the players.

 
 This is the first time in the state that Aadhaar has been made mandatory for any sport event. Top 10 teams of Bhopal will contest in the 50-over limited Netlink Dilip Buildcon cricket cup under-15 tournament which is to be organised in Mandideep from April 3.
 
 Tournament organisers are so concerned about the age issue that they have also decided to install biometric machines at the venue. “We have also made arrangement for the bone testing of the players if anyone raises doubt against any player,” said organising committee member Aruneshwar Singhdeo.
