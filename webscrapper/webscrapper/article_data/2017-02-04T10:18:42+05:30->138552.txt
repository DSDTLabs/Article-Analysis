LUCKNOW: It's official now.   candidates will contest against their Congress counterparts in at least six assembly constituencies going to polls in the third phase on February 19. The contest will occur despite the announcement of a much hyped pre-poll alliance between the two parties in which SP was to contest on 298 seats and the Congress on the remaining 105 seats in 403-strong UP assembly. 

 TOI had reported on Friday that candidates from both SP and Congress had filed their nomination papers in at least eight assembly constituencies despite a formal announcement of candidature by one or the other. After 5pm on February 3, the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers, only two SP and Congress candidates withdrew their candidatures against their alliance partners, setting the stage for a SP versus Congress match on at least six assembly seats.
 
 The most embarrassing situation has cropped in Kanpur, where Rahul and Akhilesh are scheduled to launch the alliance's Common Minimum Programme on Sunday, February 5, and follow it with a road show and public address. 
 
 SP and Congress candidates are pitted against each other in Govindnagar, Arya Nagar, Kanpur Cantonment and Maharajpur assemblies in Kanpur district.
