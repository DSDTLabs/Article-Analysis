RABCHI/HAZARIBAG: Nine Border Security Force (BSF) jawans from West Bengal, who had gone to the   and School at Meru, near   got injured on Friday, when a mortar accidentally exploded near them.

 The incident took place at a firing range in Sitagarh, around 12pm, during the mortar firing practice. Four of them are in a critical condition and will be air-lifted to be brought to a hospital in Ranchi.
 
 SP Hazaribag, Anup Birthare said, “The accident was a result of some technical fault. Instead of hitting the long-range target, the mortar fell near the jawans. The explosion injured nine of them who were taken to Sadar Hospital for treatment.”
 
 “The jawans were at the   Training Centre and School at Meru since the past one week, to practice mortar firing. They received severe splinter injuries when the mortars they fired fell on them,” said BSF commandant Anil Kumar.
 
 According to police officials, the firing range is especially meant for mortar shelling practice and BSF officials are now probing the cause behind the accident. “The 51 mm mortars are usually shot at long-range targets but how the ammunition fell on the jawans is surprising. The case is under investigation and we are waiting for the enquiry report to ascertain the cause,” said Birthare. 
 
 “The splinters of the mortar are stuck in various parts of their bodies. We will have to remove them surgically,” said Abhisekh Kumar, the doctor who attended the jawans. All of them are out of danger, he added.
