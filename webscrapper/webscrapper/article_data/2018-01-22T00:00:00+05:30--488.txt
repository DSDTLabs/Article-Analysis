When director   wrote the script of  , he knew that the film required a lot of work in terms of computer graphics. It would be a daunting task, but what gave him the confidence to go ahead was the fact that producer KA   of Suresh Arts supported him unconditonally. Not only did he give Naresh the go ahead to do whatever necessary for the film, but Suresh also got the graphics team that worked on   on board to get the best output.
“In the second half, the story transpires on an island. From a plane crash to a shark attack and more, pretty much everything had to be created in a design studio. I had a storyboard ready for each and every sequence and gave the designers images to explain what I wanted. We did the same with   as well, especially for the underwater sequence, which has a shark attack. He was told about the reactions expected of him and once we had shot that, we took that footage to the graphic designers to work on the shark It wasn't easy and we took at least six months to reach perfection. There was a lot of to and fro, but we got exactly what we wanted,” says Naresh.
 Audience reaction to the sequence on the island, adds the filmmaker has been good, with many voicing surprise that it has all been created digitally. “People know that we could not have shot with an actual shark, but many assumed that there was real footage mixed with our sequence. That’s the quality that we have brought onscreen and it gives us great pride that people have compared it to Hollywood standards,” he says.
