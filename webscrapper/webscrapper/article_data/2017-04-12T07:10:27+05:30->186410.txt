MUMBAI: The   has allowed   taxis in the   to provide   by charging 20% extra fare. The minimum fare for AC ride in a kaali-peeli will be Rs 26.

 TOI was the first to report the government was considering extra charge on AC rides for kaali-peelis 
 
 A government resolution issued on Tuesday, said, “Taxi which has a working AC and if drivers want to provide this additional service should write 'AC' in capital letters and red colour on their windscreen.”
 
 Transport minister Diwakar Raote was very keen on allowing black and yellow cabs to provide this service and had conveyed a meeting with the   unions before finalising the additional fare. A transport ministry official said: “Most taxis are new models which have an in-built AC and this will give the passengers a choice.”
 
 A commuter activists said, “Now we pay a fare which is nearly 20% more than of Ola and Uber. With the 20% hike, it will be an expensive affair,” said an activist. 
 
 Taxi union leader A L Quadros, however, welcomed the decision, saying there was a huge demand for AC service in kaali-peelis.
