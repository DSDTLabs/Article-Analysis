PATNA: The Patna high court on Thursday rejected the regular bail petition of AVN   Ramashish Singh, who is an accused in the case related to the Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC) question paper leak scam that rocked the state last year.

 Additional public prosecutor (APP) Ajay Mishra said the bench of Justice Prabhat Kumar Jha rejected the bail petition of Singh.
 
 The bench of Justice Nilu Agrawal on Wednesday had rejected regular bail petitions of Anant Preet Singh Brar, Kaushal Singh and Rakesh Ranjan, who are co-accused in the case.
 
 “It was from AVN school that the question paper was leaked,” the APP said and added Kaushal and Rakesh were touts who would lure candidates for buying the question paper.
 
 The scam that came to light on February 5 last year pertained to a four-phase clerical grade examination to fill vacancies of 13,120 posts in state government departments. The examination was later scrapped by CM Nitish Kumar. 
 
 BSSC chairman and IAS officer Sudhir Kumar is still behind bars for his alleged involvement in the scam.
