Pune: A 27-year-old software engineer was taken aback on Thursday night when two   accosted him at the parking lot of his apartment on Handewadi Road. The duo alleged that the   had driven his car in an inebriated condition and parked the vehicle in someone else’s parking area.

 The duo assaulted the techie and also threatened to take stringent action against the latter before demanding Rs 24,000. The terrified engineer withdrew Rs 19,400 from a nearby ATM kiosk and gave it to them. 
 
 Later, when he narrated the incident to his parents, they suggested him to report the matter to a senior police officer. It was then that the engineer learnt from the police that he had been duped by two imposters.
 
 The assistant-inspector of Wanowrie police, Shekhar Shinde, told TOI that the techie lodged a complaint on Saturday. An offence under sections 420 (cheating), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 170 (impersonating a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered. The complainant is a resident of Runwal Seagull society in Hadapsar. He changed his job about 10 days ago. 
 
 On Thursday, he reached the parking area around 8.45pm. “While he was heading towards his car, the two men stopped him and introduced themselves as police officers,” Shinde said adding, “The duo threatened the complainant with legal action for driving his car in an inebriated condition and demanded Rs 24,000 for not pursuing the matter.” When the complainant denied the allegations, they assaulted him.
 
 The complainant feared legal action as he joined a new company about ten days ago. “When he narrated the incident, we told him that the police never acts in such a manner. He met our staff but failed to identify anyone,” the officer added.
