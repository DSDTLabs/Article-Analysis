MUMBAI: The rising fuel prices, specially the hike in diesel rates in recent weeks, could lead to at least 10% hike in prices of essential commodities arriving in the city, warned members of the   (BGTA) on Tuesday.

 Ashok   of the BGTA told TOIthat the price of diesel across the country had gone up by Rs 6 to Rs 10 in the past few weeks, and this was “disturbing” for the transport business. “Our operational costs have escalated and the burden will be put on the end user, who will have to pay for increased costs of essential goods such as vegetables, fruits, etc,” said Goyal.
 
 The   has also petitioned the Union government with demands for a revision of diesel and petrol prices quarterly, uniform diesel price across India and reduction in customs/excise duty and VAT on diesel to bring down the rates, said   of AIMTC. “With the Union budget round the corner, this is the time for government to cut taxes for the Centre and state governments for fuel so that price rise is controlled,” Singh said.
 
 Petrol dealers are also demanding ‘One Nation, One Tax’ to bring down fuel prices.
 
  chief Sanjay Nirupam also attacked the government over the price hike.
