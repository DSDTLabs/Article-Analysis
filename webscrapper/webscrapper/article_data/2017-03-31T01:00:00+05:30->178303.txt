 is finally taken! The actor who had been bride hunting for the past one year has found his soulmate in   Iqbal, a girl who resides in Chandigarh. It was a match arranged by Anas' parents and the actor who got popular enacting the role of   in Diya Aur Baati Hum, admits that he is happy to get married to a girl of his mother's choice. He said, "My ammi has always planned and thought best for me, and somewhere in my heart, I had always wanted that she should select a girl for me. All my cousins are married and so it was time for me to also take the plunge."
Heena is only 24 years old, 14 years younger to Anas and just finished her graduation. She also belongs to Anas' hometown   in Punjab. Ask Anas what did he like about Heena and he said, "I liked her when my parents showed me her picture. And after meeting her once, I knew I had found my soulmate. I am yet to know her and wish to get married to her soon.  , people will have to give me some time to talk about her because I myself don't know much about her."
 Anas has also kept a low profile so far his work is concerned. He says, "I have not been active on my work assignments because I wanted to settle down first. It was high time I get married. Now, with everyone's blessings, I will find something interesting soon."
 The couple plan to tie the knot by the end of this year.
