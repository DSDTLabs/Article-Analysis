NOIDA: The only correctional home for juvenile offenders in Noida, one of whose inmates died of tuberculosis and alleged lack of medical care a few days ago, has been functioning with only one doctor against three sanctioned slots for the past three years.

 The facility also lacks a permanent nurse who can attend to inmates in case they suffer injuries during fights which are common in such shelter homes.
 
 Three   had been assigned to look after inmates at the juvenile home in 2015 following an order by the Allahabad high court which had directed the UP government to allot doctors to all such homes in the state. The 17-year-old murder suspect who had been living in the home for the past few years had been unwell for several days at a stretch but his TB could not be detected for long despite him being taken to the hospital. His family had alleged that had he been given proper medical care at the home, he could have been saved.
 
 Dharmendra Maurya, a teacher who has been looking after affairs of the correctional home in the absence of superintendent Nem Chand, said there was no permanent post for a doctor at the facility. “Three doctors had been assigned to visit the home twice a week each. The roster had been prepared in such a way so that one doctor is present every day for six days of the week,” he said.
 
 Dr Narendra Tiwari, the only doctor who attends to inmates, said he was being “targeted”. “Isn’t this a harassment that the only doctor attending to inmates is being asked all the questions? I have been visiting the home every Tuesday and Friday along with my regular duty in OPDs at the   health centre,” he asked.
 
 Chief medical officer   said he was not aware of the state of affairs at the home. “If this is the case, I will get it checked. We will deploy two more doctors there to check the inmates thrice a week,” he said.
