CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh district court issued notice to Chandigarh administration in a PIL (public interest litigation) regarding permanent installation of   shelters. The court of civil judge Barjinder Pal Singh issued the notice to deputy commissioner, finance secretary and administrator, secretary, CTU, in the PIL filed by advocate Pankaj Chandgothia under Section 91 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) for declaration and permanent mandatory injunction directing all the defendants to immediately erect all 350 designated   in UT and to ensure proper sitting facility, display of timetable among others in the shelter. The matter will come up for hearing on May 28.

 It was stated in the petition that a good bus shelter is an important ingredient of a cityâ€™s mass transit system. An ideal shelter is one that allows visibility and easy access to buses, is comfortable and convenient, provides clear information and is safe. It was mentioned that tenders for 242 bus shelters to be built with RRM (random rubble masonry) technique, also known stone masonry, were to be out. It was also mentioned that around 70 out of the 82 shelters needed to be demolished for being in bad shape.
 
 The delay in construction of new bus queue shelters is forcing commuters to endure vagaries of weather. They have to stand under open sky braving chilly winds during winters and rain. The plight of children going to school is inexplicable. At various bus stops, senior citizens are forced to stand while waiting, stated the PIL.
