CHENNAI: One of Chennai's oldest lakes - the  , along the Thorappakkam-Pallavaram radial road - is getting a new lease of life, thanks to the joint efforts of the state Public Works Department, Wa Tech Wabagh, a private company, and CareEarth, a Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation, which have taken up its restoration. 

 CareEarth researcher S Vasantha Raja said the   had cut right across the lake, which was originally spread over 64 acres. This lake is a major water consolidation point, as excess water from Pallavaram, Madipakkam and Kilkattalai lakes used to drain into it.
 
 The lake is part of a cascade of wetlands which were formed by a stream. This stream, which drained from west to east, joined a larger stream that drained from Ottiyambakkam into the Pallikaranai marsh. Several water bodies at Pallikaranai village were once connected to Narayanapuram through a larger stream which flowed from south-west to north, he said.
 
 While heading to Pallavaram from Thoraipakkam, one could see a large portion of the Narayanapuram lake on the left hand side where men used to wash clothes. In this part, deepening has been done. Sewage water flowing in at one place has been identified and is to be plugged.
 
 The right side portion of the lake is now covered with the invasive water hyacinth weed. Efforts are on to clear it using two boats. The restoration work included cleaning of channels close to the lake on both sides.
 
 Jayashree Vencatesan of CareEarth said: "The restoration work is totally eco-friendly and aimed at providing employment to local people."
 
 PWD sources said bio-remediation measures will be introduced to improve the water quality. Work began in the lake on December 1 and it will be completed before the end of February, Vasantha Raja added.
