 has questioned the   State Film Award jury in their decision to present the Best Director and Best Film awards to   and her film Manhole. He writes, "I have no issues with Vidhu Vincent who won the State Award for Best Film. In fact I have only respect for her as a woman who chose to make a movie without superstars. The film has only taken advantage of public sentiments in the name of the intensity of the subject. I don't think the film Manhole or Vidhu deserve an award. I hope she doesn't rejoice about this award and strive for a better film next time which will shut the mouths of critics." 

 At the same time, he appreciates the decision of the jury in picking Vinayakan for Best Actor, he adds. "I'm disappointed that   did not win any major awards," he concludes.
