Keshav Bansal, Director,   and Owner,  , talks about managing  .

 
 When I’m with my family, I make it a point to keep all gadgets and communication devices away. If my schedule permits even half a day, I take a private charter flight to spend time with them. If for some reason, I don’t find enough time, I take my mother along on tours to spend time with her. 
 
 
 I usually work out in the morning. When I have a tight schedule, I break my workout regime and exercise twice a day.
 
 
 Be involved with a sport and the moment you get time, go for your workout. Squash, running, gym or yoga, whatever you find time for, just do it. Secondly, eat what you like but in the right quantities. Right diet and being involved in an activity keeps me happy and energised.
 
 
 You need to take risks, but having taken the risk, you need to micro plan it for it to succeed. We just had a week’s time to buy an IPL team; it involved a huge financial risk. But after buying it, we are now busy micro-planning its success.
 
 
 Wake up early, have a heavy breakfast and no meal post 7 pm. In between eat what you like but be conscious about portions. 
 
 
 I keep telling myself to stay grounded and be happy with what I have. Gratitude is a must.
 
 
 I keep my work simple and have a clear objective to avoid crisis. I write down the pros and cons of every task. I always aim for the best but prepare myself for the worst. 
 
 
 If you add an activity to your family time — even if it is playing table tennis with dad — it works as a great bonding exercise. So in between all the travelling and long work weeks, I now plan one such activity a week with my family.
