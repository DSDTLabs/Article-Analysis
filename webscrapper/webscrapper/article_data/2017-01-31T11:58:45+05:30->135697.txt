BHOPAL: A week after   smashed the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s movie shoot ‘Padmavati’ in Jaipur, a   leader in Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh announced a cash award of Rs 10,000 to anyone who hurls a shoe at the film director and hits him.

 BJP leader Akhilesh Khandelwal – who is also the chairman of a civic body in Hoshangabad has posted it on his   wall citing that this reward is being announced per hit to Bhansali for distorting the historical facts.
 
 “Sanjay Leela Bhansali ko jootey marney par Rs 10,000 rupiyey inaam. (Rs 10,000 reward to anyone who hurls a shoe at Sanjay Bhansali),” reads his post.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Different Rajput organisations have accused Bhansali of distorting history by allegedly showing a romantic dream sequence between   and Muslim ruler Alauddin Khilji in his upcoming movie named after the queen.
 
 Bhansali productions, however, clarified there is no such objectionable sequence in the movie, starring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh.
 
 Talking to media later, Khandelwal said was not apologetic about his reward announcement. “I am hurt by the distortion of history by the filmmaker. Playing with our history like this can never be tolerated”, he said.
 
 Bhansali was assaulted on the sets of Padmavati in Jaipur on Friday by members of a Rajput outfit, Karni Sena. The group accused Bhansali of showing Padmavati in a poor light.
