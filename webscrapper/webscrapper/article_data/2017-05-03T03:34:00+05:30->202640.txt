Panaji: Yet another thrilling concert was held over the weekend on the occasion of International Jazz Day as some of Goa’s young musicians took the audiences by storm at the Goa state central library.

 The show began with mandolin/viola payer Anand Lobo and guitarist Joy D’souza performing a piece on classical music. They played their own brand of gypsy jazz that turned out to be a great curtain raiser. “It was a thrilling experience for the young musicians who performed with amazing confidence,” said Colin D’cruz of Jazz Goa.
 
 Saxophonist Enrico Rodrigues took to the stage with Gerard Machado on guitar, Jason Quadros on piano, Colin D’Cruz on bass and Clifford Siqueira on drums. Fadista Efiginia de Santana Miranda sang her heart out even though she sang with some spontaneously improvised accompaniment from Omar de Loiola Miranda on guitar.
 
 The show came to end with singer Daniella Rodrigues wrapping things up with a set of jazz standards backed by Jazz Junction, while Raymond Albuquerque performed a jazzed up version of the popular Konkani song, Molbailo Dou. The second part of the celebration moved to Bay15 at Dona Paula where artists opened the jam session. Goan jazz legend the late Jazz Joe’s son Christopher Pereira played clarinet, with singers Carlton Braganza, Veeam Braganza and Shaistah Thapar, drummers Allan Moraes, Dennis Coelho, William D’Souza and many others joined the gala to celebrate jazz.
