THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It is pongala eve and the street outside Bindu Sampath’s house is a veritable hive of last-minute preparations. But her house itself, situated barely 200 meters from  , is deserted.

 Bindu, mother of Nimisha alias Fathima, who went missing last year along with 21 youngsters from Kerala and is suspected to have joined the  , moved to Chennai with her husband just before the pongala festival, believed to be the largest assembly of women worshippers in the world.
 
 Bindu has offered pongala every year without fail for the last 45 years, but this year she will not offer pongala to her favourite deity as a mark of protest. “This year I am going to quit as my daughter is missing. Is devi alive or a mere idol?” reads Bindu’s   post.
 
 Bindu, a trustee and executive member of Attukal Temple has, however, offered Rs 55,000 for the special pooja to be done on the second day of the festival. “If I stay back home during the festival, that would only remind me of my daughter as it was with her that I used to offer pongala. Last year’s special pooja on the second day was offered in the name of my daughter,” Bindu told TOI over phone from Chennai. 
 
 “Nimisha and I used to offer food and water to the women offering pongala in our compound. Once they all go we would clean up all the mess left over by the devotees,” she recalled. Bindu believes that Attukal devi will notice her ‘protest’ and would help her unite with her daughter. In fact, she hopes to offer pongala next year along with her daughter and granddaughter.
