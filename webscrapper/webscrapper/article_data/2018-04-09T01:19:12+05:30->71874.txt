MUMBAI: History-sheeters on the run after committing a robbery or even murder dump their phone having understood that digging call data records and matching phone locations is a choicest tool in the police’s arsenal. But sleuths are also upping their game. Besides relying on informers, they use   to get photographs of wanted offenders.

 “Ditching phones is a rising trend among criminals. They also pick up tips from TV crime shows,” said an assistant police commissioner from the suburbs, requesting anonymity. 
 
 On February 23, Girish Gawda, a bar manager, was attacked and robbed of a bag containing Rs 2.5 lakh by three men on a bike at Andheri. Investigations revealed that auto driver Akhilesh Yadav, who often ferried Gawda to his employer’s home with the cash, had tipped off the robbers. The prime accused,  , had fled to UP, but police tracked down his aide, Suraj Singh. “Six men were involved. We got their photographs from Facebook with the help of those arrested and nabbed them,” said an officer. 
 
 Investigators also use the traditional method of gathering information from khabris (informers). In the murder case of former Sena corporator Ashok Sawant in January, the accused,   and Abhishek Mane, kept changing their location and phone numbers to evade arrest. “We made a list of their friends, acquaintances and even enemies and activated our network of khabris,” said an officer. After two months, the duo was arrested from Sangli after an informer tipped off the police.
 
 Going through call data records is the fastest way to track down a  , but CCTV cameras are helpful too. Last month, a video of a chain-snatching in a Malad society went viral. “Through the footage, we tracked down the victim, Parvati Gada, and the two accused,” said investigating officer G Nair.
