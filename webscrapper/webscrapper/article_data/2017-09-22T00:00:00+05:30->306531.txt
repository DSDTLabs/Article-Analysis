 has left no stone unturned when it comes to ensuring that his lead cast — Darshan,   and   — look their part convincing in his next,  . Darshan’s character is someone who is born and brought up abroad, so it was important for Prakash that his look conveyed that. “It was a conscious decision to make Darshan look different from his previous films. And that included everything from his haircut to costumes. I went with Darshan for the haircut and picked out his clothes. Everyone said that it would be hard to change his look, but Darshan was a darling and a complete sport. To maintain his look, his sideburns had to be shaved every 3-4 days; it was a tedious look to maintain, but he never complained,” the director says.

 
  
 In one sequence in the film, Darshan is seen playing American football. So, is he a sportsman in the film, we ask? “His character is passionate about the game; he plays it, but is not a sportsperson. We wanted to use a sport for the film as it is in line with the characterization. Everything that goes into the sport —the costume, gear, et al — was done professionally. We even hired a coach to train Darshan and then shot the sequence. Although it is only around 30-40 seconds long, it required a lot of hard work,” says Prakash, signing off.
