On Wednesday, city socialites and artists headed to an upmarket art gallery to attend the inaugural ceremony of an ongoing art   by Kolkata-based artist  . Titled ‘Enchanted’, the series of 20 paintings 
portrayed the grace and beauty of the feminine form. Art dominated most conversations as the guests marvelled at the subtle tones of his paintings and their dream-like motifs.
