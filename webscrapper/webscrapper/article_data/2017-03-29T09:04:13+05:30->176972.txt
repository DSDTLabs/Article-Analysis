BENGALURU: A 25-year-old man was   at a  , near Bagalur, North Bengaluru on Monday evening. 

 A Mithun from   and a resident in Rajanukunte, off Doddaballapur Main Road, was   from   around 6.30pm when a mechanized loading shovel emptied a full load of muck mixed with soil on him, burying him alive.
 
 Five other ragpickers from nearby rushed to his rescue, but in vain.
 
 “By the time people could rush to his help, Mithun was completely under garbage and soil. And by the time he could be pulled out, he was dead,” said police. The driver fled the scene.
 
 According to sources, ragpickers can be commonly seen at these landfills. “Ragpickers from north eastern parts of the city visit this landfill regularly. Metals, plastic and other recyclables fetch them around Rs 100-150 daily in the scrap market,” they said.
 
 Bagalur police have booked a case against the BBMP contractor, the driver of the earth mover and other officials concerned under section 304 (A) (causing death due to negligence), and have also seized the vehicle.
 
 
 
 
 Mithun was to become a father soon. His wife Sunita had gone to their home in Nadia district of West Bengal for her babyshower.
 
 Since three months, Mithun had been frequenting the Bellahalli landfill to pick recyclable plastic. His friends Raju, Mushtaq and Hasha were with him when the tragedy struck.
 
 Charges have been pressed against the driver of the mechanized shovel which lifts and unloads garbage into the quarry pit. “The driver sitting inside the glass chamber of the earthmover has a limited view. He can at the most see the quarry and the garbage pile around him,” said sources in the BBMP.
