AHMEDABAD: Even as tension in Halvad town of   and Soldi   continues to smoulder, city crime branch on Monday arrested a man who had posted objectionable comments about women of a particular caste on WhatsApp. 

 The message was posted exactly one day after a victim of the rioting in Halvad village died at   in Ahmedabad. Mob violence had erupted last Thursday, when a mob attacked some 40 people at  , a religious site of the bharwad caste, on the outskirts of Halvad.
 
 According to crime branch sources, the leader of a particular community received a message on the community’s local WhatsApp group, about girls of their community. “Through the group admin, he and other members of his caste tracked down the person who had originally posted the message to Isanpur,” said a police source.
 
 Sources said the community members first contacted the person who allegedly posted the defamatory message originally and asked him to apologize on the same group, to defuse the tension prevailing between the two communities after the Halvad rioting.
 
 As the person refused to apologize, the community members approached Naroda police with an application of complaint against that person.
 
 “Looking at the sensitive nature of the complaint, commissioner of police A K Singh immediately transferred the probe to city crime branch,” added a senior police official.
 
 A senior  said they have arrested the accused. “An offence under sections of the IT Act has been registered against the accused,” added a senior crime branch official.
