 Surprisingly, a total of 26 seats were vacant in the most popular computer science and technology across various IITs, especially at the younger IITs like Indore, Patna, Goa, Jammu, Dharwad and Jodhpur. Similar was the case with electrical engineering which had 56 unfilled spots.
 
 Of the  , there were not just seats in popular streams, but in blue chip colleges like a spot in civil engineering at IIT-Bombay and two at IIT-Delhi, two seats in aerospace engineering were vacant at the Powai campus and one in economics. Surprisingly, of the 10 seats available in IIT-Delhi, one was vacant in chemical engineering.
 
 "There could be several reasons why students have withdrawn these seats. Some candidates prefer institute over stream and many others want to pursue the stream of their choice," said an admissions dean. "What is surprising is that most of these are in the open category, which means there are candidates, but they don't want to join these courses."
