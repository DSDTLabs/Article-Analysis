Actress  , who was last seen on the TV show 'Haasil', has now shifted her focus to theatre. And her latest play ' ', holds a special place in her heart as she will be acting for the first time alongside her husband, producer  . They will play spouses in the play. 

 Sheeba says, “This is the first time I am acting with Akashdeep. Previously, I have worked with him on projects he has directed. I have always been a director’s actor I and surrender myself to his vision. Then he was the boss, but now, I am the boss... both in real life and in this play.” She adds, “As an actor, I disconnect from my personal equation when I am working, which is what people witness when Akashdeep and I rehearse together. They can see bits of Sheeba in my character, but never my relationship with him. I don’t like my personal and professional lives to intermingle.”
 
 Ask her who is the better actor among the two and pat comes the reply, “I am better! He is undiscovered so far. However, he is spontaneous because he has a funny bone.” Unlike many, the actress doesn’t see it as an advantage to work with her spouse. “There is no advantage at all. I can say a lot of things and have arguments with my co-actors. However, it’s not easy to do that with your spouse as it might affect your relationship back home!”
 
 Their love story, which dates back to the 90s, is equally interesting. They first met when Akashdeep had quit acting for direction and signed Sheeba for a film. She says, “He had a mild crush on me, which I was unaware of. We collaborated on another movie Miss 420 and went to Goa for an outdoor schedule. That’s when things clicked and we started dating. I thought it would fizzle out eventually. However, when we returned from Goa, Akashdeep sent me a diary, which was a compilation of couplets and my pictures. I still have it (smiles). We got married after dating for a couple of years.”
