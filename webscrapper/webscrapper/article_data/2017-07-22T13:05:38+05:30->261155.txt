TRICHY: The air intelligence unit of   airport seized over a kilogram of   ornaments worth Rs 28 lakh, allegedly being smuggled by three women passengers who arrived here from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore on Friday.

 The sleuths detained the women, all in their 40s, after they gave contradictory statements during their profiling.
 
 Hailing from Madurai, Jeyabpraba and Jegatheeswari arrived here in an   flight from Kuala Lumpur. The women were found to be carrying 492 grams of gold each in the form of unfinished gold chains and bangles, concealed in their inner wear. 
 
 Another 50 grams of gold was recovered from a passenger identified as Moharaj Begam, of Viruthachalam, who arrived from Singapore. The collective worth of the jewellery is estimated to be over Rs 28 lakh. 
 
 “They were unable to explain proper reasons for their travel, which raised suspicion. Moreover, they had returned within a week of their travel,” said a senior official from the airport. 
 
 The passengers were let off after inquiry.
