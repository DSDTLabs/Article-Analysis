Bambolim: A   operated by a private party at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital was sealed on Wednesday for alleged irregularities. 
 
 Health minister Vishwajit Rane, while confirming the sealing of the pharmacy, said there were several complaints against the pharmacy, including that “it sold substandard medicines”. 
  
 A GMC doctor said that while the court had issued an eviction order against the pharmacy a few years ago, the GMC administration had not shown any interest in outing the two partners, who ran the pharmacy. 
  
 The operators failed to pay electricity and other charges for years, and yet continued to occupy GMC premises free of cost, the doctor said. 
  
 “The pharmacy has been finally sealed and the key handed over to the director,” the doctor said. 
  
 Sources said the government plans on opening a bigger pharmacy at the present location, which would remain open 24X7. “There is a need of another pharmacy,” the doctor said. 
  
 There is a GAPL operated pharmacy on GMC premises, but another doctor said it doesn’t stock all medicines. “At night the GAPL pharmacy leaves a small window open and the service is not prompt,” the doctor added.
