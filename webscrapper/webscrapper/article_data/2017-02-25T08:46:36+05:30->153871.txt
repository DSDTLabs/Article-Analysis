MUMBAI:   preferred the tried-and-tested   to new entrant Majlise Ittihadul Muslimeen (MIM) in the municipal corporation  , as is clear from the fact that 11 of the 31 Congress candidates that won are Muslims. The MIM won just two seats.

 Many in the MIM blamed “outsiders” for the defeat of party candidates. “Hyderabad-based MLA Ahmed Balala didn’t know much about the socio-political situation in Mumbai. Yet he finalized the MIM tickets. Anger among genuine workers and lack of strong cadre ensured the MIM’s failure to convince the voters,” an MIM worker said. 
 
 The MIM depended a lot on Akbaruddin Owaisi’s speeches and failed to establish mass contacts. This too led to its debacle.
 
 Community leaders and political observers said the results showed that Muslims had rejected the MIM and relied on the Congress, which has often treated Muslims as its “vote bank”.
 
 “This is a clear indication that Muslims have still not accepted MIM as an alternative to the Congress in Maharashtra,” former MLA Sohail Lokhandwala said, adding that the Congress had sunk firm roots among Muslims.
 
 While the Congress’s overall performance is dismal, the winning percentage of Muslim candidates is good. “The community has still not abandoned the Congress. Otherwise it could have supported SP or MIM overwhelmingly,” city Congress vice-president   said.
 
 The MIM was unable to convince the community that it could be a viable alternative to the Congress and the NCP. “It is true the Muslims overwhelmingly supported the Congress candidates. We will introspect and find out why we failed to win the community’s confidence. We have planted a sapling in the civic body and will work harder to improve our performance in future,” MIM legislator Waris Pathan said.
