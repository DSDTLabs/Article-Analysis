SECUNDERABAD: The ‘shramdan’ of residents of Marredpally has certainly paid the dividends. The ‘KTR-Ivanka Trump Road’, which hogged the headlines for more than a week, is all set for a much-needed facelift with   engineering wing officials swinging into action on Saturday by taking up measurement of the 40ft road.

 
 Days after   completed the tender process, the officials kicked off measurement works on the 80-metre stretch beside St John’s Junior College near the busy Sangeeth Crossroads. “The road will sport a new look in another 10 days,” a senior official confirmed. The new road with interlocking pavers will be constructed at a cost of Rs 13 lakh. “We measured the height of the road. We will be able to complete the road works in 10 days. We have sent an official missive to the traffic police seeking diversion in traffic on the stretch during the time when we take up road laying work,” GHMC (Begumpet circle) executive engineer D Suresh told 
 .
 
 “Our effort to get a facelift for the stretch has opened the eyes of the authorities. We laud their work for responding quickly,” said Rohit, who took part in the protest. Residents spent Rs 4,000 and filled potholes with concrete mix and named the stretch as ‘KTR-Ivanka Trump Road’ after their pleas fell on deaf ears.
 
 Marredpally traffic inspector   said: “From Saturday night, we started diverting the traffic. The diversions will be in place for a week. Commuters coming from Sangeeth junction and proceeding towards West Marredpally and AOC Gate and adjoining areas have to take the bylane from the petrol outlet and pass through   to go to the main road (Ratnadeep), West Marredpally.”
