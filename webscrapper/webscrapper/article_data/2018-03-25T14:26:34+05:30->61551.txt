It’s a union that should reap rich rewards for both. PC Chandra Jewellers on Thursday announced a partnership with Windows Production House as a presenting partner for their upcoming films. The event at   had director duo   and   and  , joint managing director of the jewellery brand, in attendance. The cast and crew of Windows’ upcoming films — Haami, Rosogolla, Kantho and Manojder Adbhut Bari — were also present.
Speaking about the association, Prosanto said, “All the films deal with basic human relations, contemporary issues and robust family values. And as a group, PC Chandra also believes in these concepts.”
 Shiboprosad agreed and said that these two brands have joined hands because they have similar values. “This is the first time two brand names have come together for an association in the interest of cinema. And when a corporate house is taking interest in Bengali films, it is evident that Bengali cinema is not only being accepted by the audience but is also making profits,” added Shiboprosad.
 Pavel, one of the directors present at the venue, said, “Shibuda and Nanditadi have taught me how to think of Bengali cinema from a global perspective. I am sure this association will take us to new heights.”
