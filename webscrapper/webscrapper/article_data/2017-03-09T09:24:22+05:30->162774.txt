 There are two common types of glaucoma open angle and closed angle. The latter is more common among women, as their eye size smaller than that of men's. "Usually women neglect their health and don't see a doctor regularly, even though they are diagnosed with the disease. So, more number of women than men lose their eyesight due to this condition," an expert said. As part of their awareness walk, LVPEI is, therefore, hoping to impress upon the public to undergo routine eye check-ups. The test takes about two hours. "It is easier for ophthalmologists to detect glaucomatous optic nerve damage, before there is noticeable visual loss, among patients who opt for regular examinations. Sometimes, damage to the nerve can be observed even before specialised tests detect a change in vision," said Dr G C Chandrasekhar, vice president of LVPEI.
