TRICHY: As many as 20 Residents   (RWA) in the city were felicitated by the   with award of merit for their contribution in maintaining segregated solid waste management (SWM) practice. At the   celebrations held at the urban local body’s (ULB) office on Friday, 16 colleges were also felicitated by the civic body for their contributions towards raising awareness among public on Swachh Bharat Urban Mission.

 As the civic body has been implementing the revised SWM practice by insisting the public to hand over   to sanitary workers on Wednesdays and other degradable wastes during remaining days, corporation sources said that RWAs were pivotal in creating awareness among residents. 
 
 RWAs across the four zones of the civic body, according to corporation officials, have conducted weekly sensitisation meetings to raise awareness among the public to segregate waste at source before them handing over to sanitary workers. 
 
 “We also awarded young social workers for their contribution in keeping the city clean and for their spirit to help the needy. RWAs were supportive in promoting segregation at source,” corporation commissioner   said. 
 
 Similarly, 14 private institutions were awarded for sponsoring the cost-free bins distribution scheme of Trichy Corporation to segragate waste. As the Swachh Survekshan 2018 is underway, with the civic body expecting a team from SBM to conduct field inspection for grading cleanliness and other SWM activities taken by Trichy Corporation, well performing sanitary workers were also provided with certificate of appreciation to motivate them.
