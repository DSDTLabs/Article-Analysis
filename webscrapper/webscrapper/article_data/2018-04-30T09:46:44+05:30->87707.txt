CHARMINAR: Here’s some good news for the residents of Old City. Prayer rugs, or ‘Janamaz’ as they are called, are now available in an array of rich vibrant colours, texture and in a variety of designs. What’s even better is that these rugs — an essential part of Islamic worship — can now be available from any country of your choice, be it Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran or Belgium.

 With just a few days left for  , Mohammed Cap Mart has unveiled a range of imported prayer rugs and carpets at its store at Madina Circle, Patherghatti, in shades of red, blue, grey and beige.
 
 The prayer rugs are used by Muslims to cover the bare ground or floor while they kneel down to offer  , five times a day.
 
 “The Janamaz are not just available in different colours and textures, but they are also being sold at affordable prices,” said  , managing director of the store.
 
 “Decked up with Islamic designs, they promise to enhance the bliss of prayer by providing the devout the much needed comfort with their soft and velvety texture while offering prayers,” Bukhari added.
 
 While a roll of prayer rug measuring 100ft, on which 50 persons can offer prayer, comes at a price range of ?10,000 to ?50,000, the smaller rugs used by one individual, can be had for just ?270.
 
 “During Ramzan, there is a good demand for the prayer rugs and carpets. Muslims purchase them for their own homes, and many also donate the rugs to mosques in the name of their departed family members,” Bukhari said.
 
 Since the month of Ramzan is coinciding with the new academic season, a range of school bags will also be available. The bags are light in weight and come in attractive colours as well.
