LUCKNOW: Inching a step further towards regulating private school fee, the secondary education department on Tuesday formed a   under the proposed UP Schools (Regularisation of Fee Collection) Ordinance, 2017. Constituted by principal secretary, secondary education Jitendra Kumar, the 9-member committee will suggest ways to curb commercialisation of education and excessive fee levied on students in   in the state. 

 The committee headed by Kumar will comprise principal secretary higher education, secretary basic education, directors secondary education and basic education and special secretary higher education. 
 
 Retired IAS Om Pathak is private secondary school nominee, while Lucknow University vice chancellor S P Singh will take part as an academic consultant. Journalist Yogesh Kumar is a special invitee in the committee and all its members are expected to meet from time to time to send their recommendations to the government. 
 
 UP will soon join six other states in framing a law to regulate the fee structure in private schools. Aimed at providing relief to parents from spiralling school   which are increased every year, a draft ordinance has already been prepared by the secondary education department, who are at present seeking suggestions/feedback from stakeholders. The ordinance, after cabinetâ€™s approval, will prevent private schools in the state from charging exorbitant fees. 
 
 As per the draft ordinance, the government plans to put in place stringent provisions like de-recognition and cancelling the registration of schools for charging more fees than prescribed by the fee regulating committee. 
 
 Five other states, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Maharashtra have already brought in similar legislation to regulate fees in private schools.
