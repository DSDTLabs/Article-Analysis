UDAIPUR: In a bid to reduce the number of litigations pending with the courts and help parties to reach amicable settlements, a   will soon come into operation at the Mohanlal Sukhadia University(MSU) here. 

 The initiative is aimed to help common people specially from the lower strata of society to save their time and money which is spent during the tedious trial process. As a part of its social responsibility, the university, is perhaps first in the state, to extend mediation facilities between counsel and parties towards finding their solutions to the disputes in an amicable manner.
 
 The cell would start functioning by February 14, university’s vice-chancellor   said. The cell would be operated with the help of the faculties of the university’s law college. Details of pending cases would be sought from the district and sessions courts and those cases having scope for mediation or arbitration would be taken up for counselling by member experts in the cell. The university has even procured a special software to determine the case pro forma and hearing procedure. The case details would be fed in the software. 
 
 “The cell would help in mediation assisting parties in exploring issues. Parties concerned can discuss the facts and issues openly thus leading to solutions and settlements,” Sharma said.
 
 This would also increase legal awareness among people, sources said. Prof Anand Paliwal, dean of law college and faculty, Registrar Himmat Singh Bhati, legal counsellors of the varsity would be among the members of the legal settlement cell.
