Archbishop of Goa and Daman Filip Neri Ferrao along with Bishop Peter Machado of the Belgaum diocese and the ecclesiastical advisor to the World Apostolate of Fatima, led the Catholics in Goa to commemorate the apparition of Our Lady in Fatima, in Portugal, 100 years ago, at a solemn ceremony held at Se Cathedral, Old Goa, on Saturday.

 Saturday - May 13, 2017 - also gave Catholics around the world another reason to rejoice as Pope Francis, who is in Fatima, canonized Jacinto and Francisca, two of the three shepherd children who witnessed the apparition 100 years ago. While the main function to mark the occasion was held at Old Goa, simpler celebrations have also been held at all parishes across the state.
 
 The event at Se Cathedral commenced at 3pm in the afternoon, followed by adoration of the blessed sacrament and the Holy Eucharist. 
 
  Giving an historical insight into the happenings at the apparition at Fatima, bishop Machado exhorted the large congregation gathered at the Se Cathedral to imbibe the teachings of Mother Mary and recite the rosary which Mother Mary fervently asked the three Shepherd children to pray, for peace in the world. 
 
 At the end of the Eucharistic celebration, archbishop Ferrao recited prayers at the statue of our Lady of Fatima in Old Goa as he consecrated the archdiocese of Goa and Daman to the immaculate heart of Mary.
 
 Hundreds of devotees, who had travelled from across the state, then participated in the penitential procession which winded its way atop Monte de Boa Vista hillock to the church of Cruz dos Milagres. 
 
 To beat the summer heat, refreshments were provided to all the devotees after the ceremony.
