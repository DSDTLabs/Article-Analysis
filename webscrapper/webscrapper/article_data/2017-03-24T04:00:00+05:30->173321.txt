Vadodara: Vadodara Gas Ltd (VGL) – the city gas distribution joint venture company formed by GAIL Gas Ltd and Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) – has stopped work on expansion of its network and giving new connections.

 VMC officials said that the work had been stopped following a status quo order given by the Gujarat high court. The court gave order during hearing of a petition by Adani Gas Ltd that approached it against denial to start operations in the city.
 
 VGL not only has permission to work in the city, but also in the Vadodara district. Officials said that it was giving numbers to new applicants even as older applications were on hold.
