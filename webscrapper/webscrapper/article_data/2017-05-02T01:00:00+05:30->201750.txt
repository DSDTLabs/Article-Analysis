Rajkummar Rao’s distinct   and make-up in the upcoming film, ' ', has taken everyone by surprise as he is simply unrecognisable. Turns out, his 324-year-old reel character is rooted in reality. The film’s writers, Siddharth-Garima, reveal, “The 324-year-old man in 'Raabta' represents the constant, the wisdom in a time when technology didn’t exist. It took us six months to research on him and he is based on a man we met in real life. While scripting, we made a trip to Kashmir where we met this old man, who sat by a road. 

 He would keep advising us on which route to take and mouth beautiful philosophies all along. We chose a name for this character from the ancient scriptures, which is not something you would’ve heard of in today’s times. There’s a certain tone in which he speaks, which is a mix of various languages and dialects. All in all, this character holds the key philosophy of the film.”
