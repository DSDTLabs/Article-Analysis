 The trio asked Mohanasundaram to visit the Tambaram RDO office to hand over the money to them.
 
 As directed by the DVAC officials, Mohanasundaram gave currency notes laced with chemicals, which would stick on the hands of people who touch it.
 
 Mohanasundaram walked into the office and gave the currency notes to the RDO, who received the money from him, while the revenue inspector and the tahsildar were also present inside. When Mohanasundaram came out of the room, DVAC officials entered the room and caught all the three revenue officials red-handed.
 
 The DVAC officials seized the bribe money — Rs 1 lakh — from them and recorded their statements after taking their fingerprints.
 
 They were produced in a judicial magistrate court at Chengapet on Wednesday and remanded in judicial custody.
