SHIMLA: Himachal Pradesh high court has appointed senior advocate R K Bawa as amicus curiae and advocate Jivan as his assistant in the   land deal case. 

 RTI Activist   had written a letter chief justice Mansoor Ahmad Mir on December 16 last year, seeking appointment of an amicus curiae for the adjudication of the case. 
 
 “During the progress of the   land deal case in the high court, the advocates representing me left the case citing personal reasons. I approached a few lawyers, who were known to me, but they declined to take up my case due to reasons which cannot be disclosed due to the sake of decency,” Bhattacharya said in the letter. 
 
 Secretary of high court legal services committee Arvind Malhotra on january 24 informed Bhattacharya that Bawa and Jiwan have been appointed by the chief justice to appear on his behalf in the case.
 
 The HC had admitted the writ petition filed by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for final hearing in the case challenging an order passed by the   on June 29, 2015, whereby the commission had directed the Shimla deputy commissioner (DC) and additional district magistrate (ADM) to supply information within 10 days to Bhattacharya about the purchase of land by Priyanka near Shimla.
 
 The HC had stayed the order later. Priyanka is opposing the information commission’s order on the ground that revealing the information may compromise her security.
