RAIPUR: A 77-year-old   MP has been caught on camera remarking that   girls are now becoming “tan-a-tan”, triggering an outrage and opposition demands of a public apology.

 Bansilal  , who represents Korba in  , was speaking at a wrestling competition late on Monday evening as part of Gandhi Jayanti celebrations.
 
 Much to the surprise of those present at the function, the septuagenarian leader, said, “State sports minister Bhaiyalal Rajwade often tells me that now there is no need for girls from Mumbai and Kolkata. Turis (girls, in Chhattisgarhi dialect) from Korba and girls of Chhattisgarh are now becoming tan-a-tan.”
 
 When TOI asked Rajwade if he had ever said anything like this, he completely disassociated himself from Mahto’s comment, saying that the MP had “picked up a line from his earlier statement and quoted it out of context”. Rajwade’s spokesman told TOI that the minister once said that there was no need to bring artistes from places like Mumbai and Delhi as Chhattisgarh’s youngsters are “talented and capable”. He said Rajwade had nothing to do with Mahto’s remarks.
 
 Mahto’s remark has triggered an outrage across the state. Former CM Ajit Jogi’s son Amit Jogi, who was also present at the event, was quick to snub Mahto, saying he disapproved of such comments. “It’s very unfortunate for a veteran MP to make such unsavoury remarks. It clearly indicates BJP’s mindset towards women,” he said.
