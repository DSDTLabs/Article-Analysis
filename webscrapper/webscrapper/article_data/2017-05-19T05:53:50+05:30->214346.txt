RAJKOT: Three persons were arrested for allegedly raping a 38-year-old woman in   district’s Naari village on Thursday.

 The woman was gang-raped eight months ago but she did not reveal anything to her family members fearing social stigma. However, she got fed up of the accused constantly harassing her even after the sexual assault and their threats to kill her son. She approached Vartej police station on Wednesday night after revealing the trauma to her family members.
 
 Police arrested the three accused — Vallabh Rathod, Satish Rajput and Bhopa Bharwad — all residents of Naari village for the crime.
 
 The survivor told police that the crime happened when she was returning to Naari with her nephew on his bike around eight months ago. On the way, the bike broke down. The accused trio, who knew the woman, saw her and started inquiring about the boy. They even thrashed her nephew who fled the spot out of fear. They then took her to an isolated spot near the railway tracks and took turns to   her.
 
 “The woman told us that after raping her, they used to harass her by demanding sexual favours, stalking her, passing lewd comments at her and threatening to kill her son. She couldn’t take it anymore and approached the police,” said J P Gadhvi, police inspector, Vartej.
