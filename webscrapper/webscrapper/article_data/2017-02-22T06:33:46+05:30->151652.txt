HYDERABAD: Dr K Prabhakar Shastry, 78, retired principal of   and professor of surgery, will teach aspiring medicos at his own college even after his death.

 Shastry, who died on February 18, has willed that his body be donated for anatomy students of the Osmania Medical College, from where he retired way back in 1996.
 
 “We are proud of Shastry sir as he dedicated his entire life to teaching young doctors. He used to attend all medical education conferences and never showed any anger against anyone in his life,” said Sanjay Singh Yadav, city president of Indian Medical Association.
 
 His contemporary and retired principal of  , Dr  , hailed Dr Shastry’s gesture. 
 
 “He hailed from a conservative Brahmin family but still did not keep away from making a will to donate his body. He understood that anatomy students find it very difficult to learn due to shortage of bodies in medical colleges,” said Dr Murthy, who studied with Shastry in the same college. Both had retired together. 
 
 Known for being humble and down to earth, Shastry was living in the city alone at his residence near Lakdi-ka-pul when he died.
