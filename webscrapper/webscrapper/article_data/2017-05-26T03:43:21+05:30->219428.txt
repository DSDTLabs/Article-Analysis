NOIDA: Following a survey conducted by   on Wednesday, the commercial hub of the city — Sector 18 — is all set to become a one-way zone. The Authority is likely to present the final navigation route for the vehicles after meeting with traffic department and Sector 18 Market   on Monday. 

 The survey was conducted by the Authority after the market association complained regarding parking issues and perennial snarls in the area. The shop owners complained about dwindling sales because of the accessibility problems caused by snarls and mismanaged parking system.
 
 The final route through which vehicles enter the market and exit it, would be presented on a detailed map after the Monday meeting with the traffic department and the market  , officials concerned said.
 
 “We will unanimously create a traffic plan. The final navigation route will be introduced after all parties agree to it. We will give the suggestions; however, the plan will be implemented by the traffic department. After the route is agreed upon, signage will be put inside and all around the market to direct drivers,” S C Mishra, project engineer, Noida Authority told TOI.
 
 Over the last few years, Sector 18 has been undergoing a massive face-lift. As per the Authority officials, the ongoing repairwork in the market will be finished soon. 
 
 The ongoing repair-work has also triggered parking issues in the area. The completion of multi-level parking project is further expected to resolve the parking hassles. 
 
 “We have expressed our concern with the Noida Authority officers who visited the market. Solving the parking problem and an introduction of a one way system may help vehicles to move through the market smoothly. The issues must be addressed urgently,” Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 Market Owners Association, said.
 
 Pertinently, Noida Authority had introduced one-way navigation in the market on a trial basis last year.
