HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here has directed   to pay 60,000 and return 408 grams of   ornaments to a consumer, after the firm auctioned it without prior intimation.  , the complainant, submitted that she availed two loans for a total sum of 7.92 lakh by pledging gold ornaments . 

  She said that on September 21, 2015, the firm sent a notice asking her to pay principal amount along with interest of 53, 755, failing which the ornaments will be auctioned on October 8, 2015. 
 
 In response to the notice, Khatoon said she paid 70, 000 on October 21 and informed that the entire loan will be cleared by December 2015. 
 
 On December 8, she said that the firm sent a vague letter, without mentioning the particulars of gold items, weight of the gold, date of auction etc, stating that the ornaments were sold and after adjusting loan amounts, there was a surplus of 83,658. When she confronted the company officials , they assured to return the jewellery as they sold it by mistake. 
 
 Manappuram finance said that complainant failed to adhere to terms of the payment schedule, resulting in auctioning . They further said that the allegations made by the complainant regarding the auction of gold without issuing any kind of demand notice are false.
 
 The bench said: "There is a clear case of deficiency in service as the Opposite Party informed about the date of the auction as October 8. For some auction was not held on the said day and they received 70, 000 on October 21 towards the said two loan accounts. In spite of receiving the said amount, the Opposite Party held an auction on November 11 where the complainant had no information regarding the date and place of auction. Had the complainant known about the auction, she would have participated in the auction and might have repaid the total loan amount, as every woman has an emotional attachment to their gold ornaments. Therefore, certainly, Opposite Party actions amount to unfair trade practice."
