BHOPAL: Hostellers of Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology ( ) presented a memorandum to   regarding the poor hostel facilities. Students have also suggested ways to improve their condition.

 In the memorandum, they said that MCA second year students are staying in old   which are in very poor condition. Many students are even suffering from viral fever and various water-borne diseases due to contaminated water. They have even alleged that they were forced to pay extra money by the management despite the shoddy state of the hostels. 
 
 Hostellers also raised the issue of delay in returning the caution money paid by them at the time of taking admission to the hostels. 
 
 Students of third year and M.Tech courses who stay in hostel no. 10 alleged that they had signed an undertaking stating that they will stay without basic facilities like bed, chairs, internet till August 2016. But, they are still bereft of those facilities despite passage of the deadline.
 
 With no sweepers in hostel 10, the students are compelled to deploy temporary workers to address the issue.
 
 Students suggested that the student council must be provided with current status of central account like total money deposited, money utilised till date, interest generated and how much interest has been used per hostel.
 
 A committee has to be formed that should include dean, students welfare, chief of wardens, chief convener (final year students) and students council. It should visit every hostel and implement the required changes.
 
 MANITâ€™s director   said he will look into the matter once the issue is brought to him.
