GOLD COAST: It’s time for another India-Pakistan match. This time it’s hockey. Any clash between the South Asian rivals always gets fans of both countries, spread across the globe, worked up and a win at any stage of the competition, is as prestigious as a final victory. 

 
 The tickets for the weekend match were sold out just hours after the online window opened a few months back and one can expect a carnival atmosphere at the Gold Coast Hockey Centre.
 
 
 
 
 With sporting ties between the neighbours disbanded for years now, such mouth-watering clashes occur only in big-ticket games. The last tournament, where the former powerhouses met, was the 2017 Asia Cup in Dhaka where India beat Pakistan twice, 3-1 in the pool stage and then following it up 4-0 in the Super 4s. India are on a seven-match winning streak against Pakistan beginning from the 2016 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup. Saturday’s face-off should be no different.
 
 Asked about the pressure that accompanies such a clash, more so in the opening fixture, India coach   sounded confident and said they are not really perturbed about whom they play. “I may sound a bit boring to you but we are more concerned about executing our plans than worrying about our rivals. I’m confident that Indian can beat Pakistan tomorrow, though in sports nothing is certain,” the Dutchman told TOI.
 
 Striker SV Sunil also played down the build-up of an India-Pakistan meeting. “I look at it as any other match and we will play to win this too. Being a senior player I should not take pressure,” he said.
