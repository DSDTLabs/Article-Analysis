MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Friday directed actor   to appear before it on February 28 to as certain his identification marks.
On Friday, Dhanush's petition seeking to quash the proceedings initiated by the judicial magistrate court in Melur based on a case filed by  , 65, and his wife  , 53, seeking maintenance from the actor, claiming he was their son, came up for hearing before  .
 
 The couple had filed a counter to an affidavit filed by the actor stating that he was not their son and somebody was goading the couple to extract money from him. Denying the identification marks mentioned by the couple, the actor said that he did not have a mole on his collar bone and a scar on his forearm.
 
 The couple however said the actor's denial of identification marks must not be believed. The actor had submitted a birth certificate, as per which he was born on July 28, 1983. However, the couple said the birth certificate was not genuine because the actor's name was not mentioned in the certificate.
