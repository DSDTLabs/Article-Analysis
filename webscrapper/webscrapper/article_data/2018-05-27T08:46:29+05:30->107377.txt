CHANDIGARH: Panjab University syndicate on Saturday approved the policy decision to introduce ‘earn while you learn’ scheme for the students. Under the scheme, the students will be paid Rs 100 per hour and each student will be allowed to work for a maximum of 40 hours in a month.

 It was pointed out by syndicate member   that the phrase ‘part-time jobs’ should be replaced by ‘earn while you learn’ scheme. Moreover, syndicate member Gurjot   said the students who would avail this scheme should be provided with a work experience certificate. Sources said Malhi put forward before the syndicate that providing work experience certificate would help them when they further go abroad for higher studies or jobs. 
 
 According to the proposal, a committee constituted by the PU vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover had identified certain part-time jobs including those of part-time library assistants in the department and A C   library, part-time teaching assistants in teaching labs, part-time data entry operator/computer operator for   work.
 
 It was discussed in the meeting that A C Joshi library has already prepared the budget estimates and other departments should also prepare the same. The budget prepared by the departments can then be included in the budgetary requirements for the current financial year. It was earlier this week that TOI had reported that the students of Hindi department of PU are already running their library and they are not getting any incentive for that.
 
 Moreover, the syndicate also approved to grant special chance to the students of BE and ME from   to appear at the end of this year. Now, the BE students can appear simultaneously in even and odd semesters first year onwards to clear re-appears of various semesters. The ME students can appear simultaneously in even and odd semesters to clear their re-appears of various semesters.
