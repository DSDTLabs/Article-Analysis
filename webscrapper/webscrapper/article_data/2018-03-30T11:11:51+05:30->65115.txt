GUWAHATI: The   (AHSEC) will not re-conduct the physics, chemistry and mathematics papers of the Class XII state board examinations, as decided by the all-powerful executive council of the education board in a crucial meeting on Thursday. This development comes in the backdrop of a question paper leak crisis in the CBSE exams, leading to the central board declaring re-examinations to the Class X maths paper and the Class XII economics paper. 

 AHSEC chairman Dayananda   on Thursday said exams will not be re-conducted as the allegations of question paper leak has not been established like in the case of the CBSE paper leak. An inquiry committee led by retired district and sessions judge BC Das recently recommended that the AHSEC re-conduct the three major Science papers as there were suspicions that the question papers had been leaked from a private educational institution in  .
 
 "The inquiry committee did not say the board's original question papers were leaked. Only a certain percentage of questions asked in the internal test papers of one institute matched with the original papers of AHSEC. Since the question papers were not leaked after we dispatched them for the exam centres and anomalies were reported only from one institute, the question of re-conducting the three exams in all exam centres doesn't arise," Borgohain told TOI. 
 
 Borgohain added that re-conducting exams will have an adverse impact on those students who have started preparing for various medical and engineering entrance examinations. 
 
 The AHSEC executive council meet also decided to expedite the process of appointing a permanent controller of examinations and resolved to reconsider the policy of announcing top-10 rank holders in the Class XII state board exam next year.
