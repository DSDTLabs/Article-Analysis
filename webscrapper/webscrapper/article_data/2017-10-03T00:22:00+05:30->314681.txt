Jaipur: The state celebrated the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Monday by cleaning, plantation drives and holding seminars by educational institutes and social organizations.

 Several government schools in the state held cleaning drives as the state government sought to instill a sense of cleanliness among students.
 
 The attendance in schools was low but those who came participated in cleaning the school premises and other activities to honour Gandhi.
 
 Ameen Kaimkhany, president of Rajasthan Urdu Teachers Association, said they held a session on Gandhian philosophy. “Students were told how Gandhi was still relevant today. We also held a quiz on the Father of the Nation,” said Kaimkhany.
 
 While most private schools were closed, others celebrated the day by holding small skits and discussing Gandhian values. This year, state varsities have suspended the holiday given on Gandhi Jayanti and directed vice-chancellors hold programmes on Gandhi.
 
 The Centre for Gandhian Studies in Rajasthan University organised a seminar on Gandhi and ethics. The seminar shed light on how Gandhian values have inspired movements in several countries, from the one against Apartheid in South Africa to the civil rights of Martin Luther King Jr in the US. Besides, social and political groups garlanded statues of Gandhi across the state. In the evening, civil society groups organised candle lighting at statues as a mark of respect. Several groups also cleaned roads and public places.
