NEW DELHI: A   officer at   was   early on Wednesday while controlling movement of trucks at the wholesale market.

 Local traders claimed that Sumer Singh (52), who was working with   (APMC), was shot on the head from behind following an argument with some truckers over theft of goods from their vehicles. 
 
 Some traders also told cops that Singh had an argument with some drivers over parking of trucks near the gate a few minutes before the incident. Singh had threatened to stop the errant drivers from entering the market if they did not comply with the norms, said traders.
 
 The possibility of Singh being attacked for trying to stop a group of thieves has also not been ruled out. Sources said that around 6am, the assistant security officer saw some men, coming from the Azadpur station side, going towards the shed where fruits were being packed. Confronted, they failed to explain why they were there and one of them suddenly pulled out a pistol and shot Singh. 
 
 As other members of APMC tried to catch them, the accused managed to climb over a wall and fled. Singh was taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital where he died during treatment. 
 
 A murder case has been registered. “We are probing all angles. His belongings and mobile phone are being scanned,” said Milind Dumbere, DCP, northwest. The empty cartridge of the bullet has been recovered from the spot. 
 
 Singh, a wrestling champion from Nangloi, was employed in 1984 in the sports quota. He is survived by a 25-year-old son and a 22-year-old daughter who is pursuing BDS, said Manoj Kumar, APMC secretary. 
 
 Members of the market committee staged a protest later in the day, alleging lax security measures. They alleged the market didn’t have enough CCTV cameras and many of them were often out of order.
