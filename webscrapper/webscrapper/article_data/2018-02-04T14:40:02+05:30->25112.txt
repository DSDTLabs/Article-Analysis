PATNA: The   (IGIMS) has seen a 50% increase in the   cases coming to it during the last five years. This was revealed at a continuing medical education (CME) programme on Saturday. 

 “Aggravated cases of constipation leads to piles, fissure and fistula, which are also on the rise. The main causes of constipation are western diet as well as deviation from our normal habit of defecation,” said IGIMS medical superintendent and HoD of department of gastrointestinal surgery Dr Manish Mandal at the CME.
 
 According to doctors, an anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. It occurs when you pass hard or large stool during a bowel movement. It can cause pain and bleeding.
 
 “An anal fistula is an infected tunnel between the skin and the anus. It’s the result of an infection in an anal gland that spreads to the skin. Fistulas cause pain, swelling and discharge of blood or pus from the anus, and usually require surgery. Fistulas are often a symptom for intestinal cancer,” Dr Mandal said.
 
 According to him, reduced intake of fibrous diets and consumption of fast food that lacks fibre and are high on fat also cause constipation.
 
 The habit of consuming food within two-three minutes and then drinking a large amount of water in one go in the fourth or fifth minute is another cause of constipation. 
 
 “When we consume food, enzymes are activated and acid is secreted for the digestion of food. A large amount of water turns the acid into alkali and the food is not properly broken down. Stool formation is thus delayed, causing constipation,” added Dr Mandal.
 
 Water should be consumed at least 30 to 45 minutes after the meal, say doctors.
 
 Dr Ashok Kumar of PGI-Lucknow, who is the president of  , said aggravation of constipation can be avoided by consuming fibrous diets, exercising and consuming a proper amount of water every day.
