RAJKOT: Slogans of ‘Jai Sardar, Jai Patidar’ rang out in several Patel-dominated villages in Gujarat’s Jamnagar and Morbi districts as Congress vice-president   Gandhi hit the campaign trail on the second day of his visit to Saurashtra on Tuesday.

 People in   caps lined up along the roads to greet Rahul, who also wore one that had ‘Jai Sardar, Jai Patidar’ written on it.
 
 The Rahul-Patel bonhomie came on a day Patidar quota activist   warned of a renewed agitation for reservation for the community under the OBC quota. While Rahul invoked the legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to strike a chord with the community, he also said he shared their anger over police atrocities amid the violence that followed Hardik’s arrest in 2015.
 
 “It was you (the Patel community) who gave the country Sardar Patel. But the BJP government committed atrocities on you. Bullets were also fired on Patels. This is not the style of Congress. We believe in moving ahead with all communities,” said Rahul.
 
 Crowds gathered at his rallies yelled “Vikas gando thayo che (development gone berserk)” in unison as Rahul asked them: “Gujarat mein vikas ka kya hua hai (What’s happened to development in Gujarat?)” A day after hitting out at PM Modi over the note ban, and GST, Rahul said he hadn’t given the   government a free hand in development.
 
 “The state government is operating via remote control,” he said. He also accused Modi of resorting to “jumla” (gimmick) politics instead of doing concrete work.
