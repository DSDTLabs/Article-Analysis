Rajkot: A week after a 17-year-old class XII student jumped off the 10th floor of Leuva Patel Boarding School in the city, the Malaviyanagar police lodged an offense of abetment to suicide against unnamed students and the hostel warden.

 Sagar Bhanderi, a native of Kalavad village of Jamnagar district, had committed suicide by jumping off the hostel building on September 11. Footages of various CCTV cameras installed in the hostel showed that Sagar was beaten up in the warden's room by some students at around 11am.
 
 His father Vallabh Bhanderi, a farmer, lodged a complaint against the students seen in CCTV footages as well as the hostel warden on Tuesday.
 
 Harshad Mehta, assistant commissioner of police, said, “We have questioned several students after scanning the CCTV grabs. Some of them told us that Rs 600 cash was stolen from one of the student’s room. He suspected Sagar of the theft. They told Sagar that he was seen stealing the cash and took him to see the CCTV footages. However, he was beaten up then.”
