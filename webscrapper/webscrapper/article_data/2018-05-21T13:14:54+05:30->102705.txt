TRICHY: Apiculture, popularly known as  , can increase agricultural yield by up to 20 to 80 per cent, claimed researchers at the   - Krishi Vigyan Kendra (ICAR-KVK), Sirugamani, at an awareness event held here on Sunday.

 The awareness drive was conducted for farmers on honeybee and the role of beekeeping in agriculture, on the occasion of World Bee Day, celebrated across the world on May 20.
 
 More than 100 farmers, rural youth, women and aspiring apiarists participated in the event, which was held at the   at Sirugamani near  .
 
 “Beekeeping can contribute to agriculture in a major way and our aim is to make farmers understand it,” said S Easwaran, ICAR-KVK project coordinator. “Though it might seem to be an exaggeration, beekeeping can actually increase agricultural yield by 20% to 80%. This fact is backed by several review and research papers,” he told TOI and added that the percentage varies based on the crops.
 
 Experts suggest that aspiring apiarists should first assess the potential of floral resource in their area and only then start beekeeping. 
 
 Assistant professor (entomology) at ICAR-KVK, V  , said, “Creating a garden to suit beekeeping is more efficient. An ideal garden for beekeeping should have plants with both nectar and pollen and those that bloom throughout the year.”
 
 The Indian hive bee is considered to be the most ideal for beekeeping in the country.
 
 Beekeeper, P Kaliyaperumal, who set up a stall and demonstrated the beekeeping process to the participants, said that the cost of setting one beehive – including all the necessary equipment – on an average is Rs 5,000. “Setting up beehive is only half the process. To ensure that beekeeping is profitable, one should know each and every facet about bees, how they react to different situations and more,” said Kaliyaperumal, who has been a beekeeper for more than three decades.
