AHMEDABAD: Even as the fire-fighting was going on at  , where a major blaze was reported on Wednesday, Ahmedabad   (AFES) received a call on Thursday morning from   where a wood cutting and storage unit was gutted. 

 Just as the fire vehicles were returning in the afternoon, a call was received from Naroda GIDC Phase I where   reported a major fire. The heat was so intense that some of the drums containing ink exploded and a few of the employees sustained minor injuries. While the unit gutted completely, an adjoining factory, manufacturing elastic for textile industry, also got affected. 
 
 As the summer is at its peak, it is also the busiest time for the city’s fire brigade. According to the AFES officials, compared to the yearly average of fire calls there has been a rise of about 20% since May 1.
 
 Rajesh  , additional chief fire officer, AFES, said that there are more fire incidents in summer due to two factors. “Spontaneous fires take place in garbage, stored inflammable material such as paper and open grass due to high temperature. Another factor is combination of internal and external heat for vehicles and machine parts. Sometimes the electric wiring also gets affected due to which short-circuit is one of the most common cause of fire,” he said.
 
 Bhatt said that maintenance is the key to prevent the blaze. “One has to invest in better maintenance and coolants to prevent chances of fire. We often see that faulty design, human errors and factors such as low-quality products also result in major mishaps,” he said.
 
 In past 20 days, AFES has recorded 84 incidents. The settings of fires include industrial areas, production units, offices and residences and the geographic locations are almost evenly spread in eastern and western city parts. AFES officials said that fortunately there has been no major loss of life in any of the incidents. In all major cases, the forensic science experts are roped in to ascertain the cause of fire, they added.
