CHANDIGARH: Ever since a section of   leaders, especially   faces of the party, openly expressed displeasure over the recent cabinet expansion, speculations are rife about various lobbies approaching the party high command with their demands.

 
 Sources close to technical education minister   on Tuesday refuted reports that he was in Delhi to seek a better position in the party as he was expecting a better portfolio after the cabinet expansion. There had been speculations that the party may even consider appointing a deputy chief minister to pacify the Dalit leaders.
 
 After Channi-led deputy speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti approached the sulking Tanda   to meet party president   last week, there have been reports of a group of MLAs holding meetings to express grouses.
 
 Though Congress leadership claimed that more than expected number of party workers from Punjab participated in Rahul’s rally in Delhi on April 29, many MLAs gave the event a miss, fueling speculations that they were upset with the party.
 
 “Apart from the fact that many of the Dalit leaders themselves expected a cabinet berth or a better portfolio, now they seem to have come together to allege that the party had given a raw deal to the Dalit community by not giving them an adequate representation,” said a party leader.
