Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued notice to Punjab and the Union government on a plea against expansion of the state cabinet. The main contentions in the plea are that the number of ministers in Amarinder Singh cabinet is beyond 15%, which is against the Constitutional provisions.  The case would now come up for further hearing on May 9. The matter reached before the HC in the wake of a PIL filed by advocate Jagmohan Singh Bhatti. According to the petitioner, the council of ministers in a state should not exceed 15% of the total number of the MLAs. “In the present case it exceeds 15% of the total strength of the House. The state while appointing ministers and exceeding 15% of the House strength has flouted the Constitutional amendment,” the petitioner added. The court was also informed that Punjab had a strength of 117 MLAs in the assembly. In view of the 91st amendment, the number of ministers in a state cannot exceed 17, including the chief minsiter. On April 21, Amarinder had inducted nine new ministers in the existing cabinet. Initially, he had taken over as CM with eight ministers in March 2017 after the Congress came to power in Punjab.
