JAIPUR:   (JDA) officials on Tuesday conducted a site inspection for constructing an   connecting the main building of   opposite to it on  . 

 JDA has proposed the underpass to avoid mishaps while transporting patients via the busy road. Officials examined the area to check feasibility of the underpass. A detailed project report (DPR) has already been commissioned and will be prepared by a Pune-based consulting firm. 
 
 “The project is estimated to cost Rs 15 crore. The appointed firm will present its project report in three months,” said a JDA official. 
 
 The official added that once the underpass is built, patients and their relatives will not have to jostle in the traffic and commuting would be risk-free. 
 
 With rise in the number of accidents on the road, hospital administration had earlier asked for connectivity between two premises several times. Moreover, the crossing between two buildings also has heavy traffic congestion. 
 
 The underpass is expected to connect the trauma centre and underground parking at SMS. The passageway would be designed in such a way that stretchers can pass through easily. 
 
 Earlier, a foot over-bridge was proposed at the site. However, it was shelved due to technical reasons. “It was realized that it would be tedious to carry patients on stretcher on the foot-bridge. Moreover, with the future expansion of   rail, the foot over-bridge would not be a feasible thing,” added the official.
