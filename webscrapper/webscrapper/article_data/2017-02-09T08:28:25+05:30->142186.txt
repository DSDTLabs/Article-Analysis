JAIPUR: The   ( ) of Rajasthan police on Wednesday claimed a major breakthrough in honeytrapping case after it arrested Nitesh Bandhu, one of the two masterminds of the racket that extorted Rs 12 crore from 25 victims by implicating them in false rape cases.

 Confirming the arrest, SOG’s inspector general (IG) Dinesh MN told TOI that Nitesh, an advocate by profession was arrested by his team from a house in Karni Vihar area of the city. 
 
 “This racket was the brainchild of two advocates, Naveen Devani and Nitesh Badndhu. The duo along with Anand Shandilya and   extorted money from people,” he added.
 
 Dinesh MN added that gang members Akshat and Ananad would find out targets, introduced girls to affluent people, and laid a trap. Later on, the girl would file a rape case and take victim to court. 
 
 “The second stage of the blackmailing was taken care of by Nitesh Bandhu, he will get involved in legal and police related procedures, broker a blackmailing deal and extort the money,” he added.
 
 The SOG team had come across the racket while the sleuths were investigating Shandilya for his alleged links with fugitive gangster Anandpal Singh. 
 
 Dr. Sumit Soni, a city based doctor had approached SOG, he alleged that he was jailed in a fake rape case and his family had to pay crores of rupees in extortion. “Acting on Soni’s complaint, the sleuth unearthed the entire racket.
 
 The modus operandi of the gang was first to trap their victims and collect video evidence to blackmail the victim. 
 
 Later, Akshat Sharma would approach the ‘victims’ posing as mediaperson with the video clips and demand hefty amount of money. When the victims refused to pay the amount, a rape case would be lodged against them. 
 
 During the trial the girl would turn hostile in the court if the money was adequately paid. The SOG has arrested as many as 15 gang members in the case, including girls who trapped people for money. The hunt for the final target- Naveen Devani is on.
