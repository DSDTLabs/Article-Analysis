  The exchange group had 44 Pakistani school students between the age-group of 10-14 years. The exchange programme has been taking place since 2010. It is a year-long programme which starts with sending letters to the students of Pakistan, sharing oral histories and sending postcards.

This visit was earlier scheduled to take place in September, but due to the surgical strikes, it was postponed to May.
