Rajkot: A number of people held protest at B T Savani Kidney hospital in the city on Saturday after reports that 17 patients got infected with jaundice after dialysis there in last three months. However, the hospital authorities denied the allegations and demanded that government first investigate the blood banks from where the blood is procured. Managing trustee of the hospital Dr Vivek Joshi told media persons, “Jaundice virus is found in some of the patients that doesn’t mean they will fall sick. None of our patients suffered from jaundice. We are ready to face any kind of investigation that government wants to undertake.”tnn
