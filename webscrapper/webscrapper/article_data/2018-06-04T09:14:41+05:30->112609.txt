AHMEDABAD: A 45-year-old man met with a road accident in Sabarmati area of the city when he went out to attend nature’s call, as he doesn’t have a toilet at home. Sabarmati police have registered a case of rash driving in the case. 

 
 Jodhaji  , a daily wager and resident of Bhavaji Vanjhara’s Chawl near Power House Circle in the Sabarmati area, states in the FIR, “As I do not have a toilet in my home, I go outside to release myself. On May 31, I was going towards a municipal corporation-run community toilet. Due to ongoing Metro rail project work, the road had been made one-way for vehicles. When I was crossing the road, an over-speeding motorbike hit me on my left leg, due to which I fell on the road and sustained injuries.”
 
 Mubarsa was later rushed to a nearby private hospital where it was found his left leg had been fractured. The man who hit Mubarsa, Bipin Prajapati, also suffered injuries and was taken to the hospital. 
 
 Sabarmati police lodged an FIR under IPC sections 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 279 (rash driving) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt).
