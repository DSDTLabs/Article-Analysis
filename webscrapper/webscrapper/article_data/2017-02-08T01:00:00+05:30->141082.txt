Rajkumar Hirani’s biopic on actor   rolled last month, with   playing the actor and   stepping into Sanjay’s late actor-politician father Sunil Dutt’s shoes. But few would know that initially, Sanjay wanted to play Ranbir’s dad in the biopic. 
However, he finally dropped the idea. 
 Though he was sure no one would know the nuances of his father’s personality better than himself, he found it odd to play his dad on screen. Maybe, he didn’t want the attention to be divided between the real and the reel Dutt.
 According to a source, “Sanjay has given over 200 hours of recording as basic matter for the biopic. While   was writing the film, Sanjay was toying with the idea of playing   because as a father, he was the one person who had closely seen the ups and downs in his life. Sanjay was extremely close to his dad, and he thought he could emulate him better than any other actor. But he dropped the idea, even before letting his buddy Raju know what he had on his mind, and allowed him to choose an actor who’d be perfect to play the late actor.”
 Sanjay remained unavailable for comment.
