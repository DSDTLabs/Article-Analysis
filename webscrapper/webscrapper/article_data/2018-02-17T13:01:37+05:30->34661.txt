When she was two months pregnant, she came to know about his first wife, which led to a major fight between them. Rizwan drove her out of the house around a year back.”
 
 Parveen had approached Saoner police station and lodged offence of physical harassment and mental torture against Rizwan, which angered him, and he decided to implicate her in a case.
