CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu police informed the   that special safes for storing seized   are being established in five districts (one per zone) at a cost of Rs 59.78 lakhs.

 “This apart, designated rooms have been allotted in each   with appropriate security to store such contraband,” the department said in response to a query raised by Justice R   on safe custody of seized contraband.
 
 Through an affidavit, assistant inspector general of police Maheshwaran further submitted that, in view of a   directive, such facilities to store seized contraband are being constructed in Chennai for the north zone comprising Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chennai); Trichy (central zone comprising Trichy, Karur, Ariyalur); Madurai (south zone comprising Madurai, Virudhunagar, Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli) and Coimbatore (west zone comprising Coimbatore, Tirupur, Salem, Erode), and in Theni.
 
 A government order dated January 10, 2017 was passed allocating funds for the purpose for which construction is being done by the Tamil Nadu Police Department Housing Corporation, he added. Recording the submissions, the judge reserved his orders.
 
 The issue pertains to an appeal moved by Danraj challenging an order of a special court for NDPS cases, sentencing him to seven months of rigorous imprisonment. During a recent hearing, wondering whether police stations in the state are equipped with proper facilities to store seized contraband, the judge said, “Whenever contraband was seized, this court has noticed that the substance would be produced in court only after a delay. It may be after some weeks or more. There is no record to show that till such time the contraband was produced in court, its was in safe custody at the police station,” and directed the DGP to file a report on availability of such facilities.
