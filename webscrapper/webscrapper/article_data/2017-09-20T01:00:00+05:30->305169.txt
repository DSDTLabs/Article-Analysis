Sanjay Dutt’s comeback film, director Omung Kumar’s ' ', is an emotional revenge drama about a father and a daughter. The actor says that the role helped him experience certain moments of fatherhood that he had missed out on in real life with his daughters,   and Iqra. 

 He says, “My father ( ) always taught me that respect for women defines the character of a man and his home. It cannot be compromised upon. One of my biggest regrets is that I haven’t been around to see my children — Trishala, Shahraan and Iqra — grow up. Circumstances decided the course of my life and in turn, my relationship with my kids. There’s certain tenderness in a father-daughter relationship that Bhoomi allowed me to experience with Aditi (Rao Hydari), who plays my daughter. For instance, there’s a scene where she dyes my hair. In another sequence, I oil her hair. The movie allowed me to experience on reel what I missed out on in my real life.”
 
 'Bhoomi', produced by T-Series and Legend Studios, releases on September 22.
