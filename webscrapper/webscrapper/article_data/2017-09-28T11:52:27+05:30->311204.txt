Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay   on Wednesday asked the education officer ( ) to initiate action against illegal schools running in Nagpur district within four weeks. 

 A division bench comprising Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Justice Arun Upadhye also asked the EO to complete the process within six months before disposing of a public interest litigation.
 
  had informed the court that around 54 schools were illegal in Nagpur district as they didn’t have recognition from the concerned authority.   submitted before the court that though the information about these schools was provided by the education officer in a Right to Information (RTI) reply, yet the EO failed to take action against them.
 
 Bisen’s counsel Ankush   said though the EO had powers under Section 18 of the Right to Education ( ) to crackdown on illegal schools, the department was turning a blind eye towards them.
 
 Tirukh said the court asked the respondents on what basis these schools were deemed illegal. Appearing on behalf of the respondents, government pleader Sumant Deopujari stated that 31 schools don’t have recognition and therefore illegal. The court then directed the EO to punish those schools not having recognition as per provisions within six months.
 
 Bisen had filed the PIL in June but the matter came up for hearing on Wednesday. Tirukh said the court had expressed concern if the PIL was heard during peak admission period and the schools would have been adversely affected though they were not direct respondents.
