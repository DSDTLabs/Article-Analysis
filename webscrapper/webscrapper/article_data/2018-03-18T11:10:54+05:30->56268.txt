BHAGALPUR: The   administration on Saturday ordered snapping of the   in the district so as to prevent rumour mongering after   marred normal life in Muslim-dominated Nathnagar locality.

 The trouble began when a ‘Vikram Samvat’ procession, taken out on Saturday afternoon to spread awareness about the historical Hindu calendar system, made a brief halt near Medni Chowk. 
 
 This was opposed by a section of locals. Heated exchange of words soon gave way to clashes. The situation worsened as some miscreants torched a two-wheeler and vandalized shops in the area. 
 
 Police had to fire several rounds to quell the rampaging mob.
