GUWAHATI: As chief ministers from all North East Democratic Alliance ( )-ruled states came together on Sunday,   chief minister   said the solution to the Naga political problem will not go against the interest of neighbouring states. 

 
 "The support of all northeastern states is essential to find a solution to the Naga political problem even as the Centre and Nagaland government work together for an early resolution," Rio said at the third Neda conclave. "I say with confidence that when the Naga issue is resolved, a lot of thing in Northeast will ease out in terms of progress and development. The resolution is in the interest of the region," he added. 
 
 Rio's assurance came at a time when doubts are being cast by Nagaland's neighbouring states - Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and   - on the issue of territorial integrity of Naga-inhabited areas in these states, as espoused by   (IM) for the creation of a Greater Nagalim. 
 
 "Prime Minister   has taken interest in the resolution. Our state government is also working for an early solution. But the support of other northeastern states is very much essential for the resolution. We the Nagas will not go against the interest of other states. Neither will be deprive any other state," Rio said.
