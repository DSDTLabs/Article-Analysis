Ishita and Toshi are worried as Aaliya's lehenga is burnt. Everyone panics as they are late for the mehendi function at Mani's place.
 
  Roshni suggests Ishita to buy the same lehenga from nearby stores. Ishita agrees and goes with Mihika, Roshni and Bala to find lehenga in nearby showrooms.
  
  At Mani's house, all the guests arrive and wait for the Bhalla family. Shagun complains to Mani and he asks her to be patient. Shagun asks the mehendi artist to start applying it on Aaliya's foot but she wants to wait for Bhalla family to get 'shagun ki mehendi'.
  
  
 
  
  On the other hand, Ishita is unable to find a similar looking lehenga anywhere. Toshi calls Ishita to come soon as Shagun is getting irritated and the guests are waiting. Bala suggests Ishita to leave for the function and he will check more shops with Mihika.
  
  Ishita reaches the function and dances with Aaliya. Shagun comes in and asks about the lehenga. Ishita lies that it is with Mihika and she will bring it soon. Shagun finds this suspicious.
  
  Raman then calls Ishita and tells her that he will join them soon as he has gone to Chennai to get a surprise for Aaliya. Bala and Mihika are not able to find the lehnga. Ishita applies mehndi to Aaliya.
