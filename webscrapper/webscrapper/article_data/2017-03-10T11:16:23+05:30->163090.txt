JAIPUR: The   of medical teachers in the   (SMS) Hospital paralysed the healthcare services on Thursday.

 It is for the first time when medical teachers in SMS Hospital have gone on strike in the past five years.
 
 Patients were unaware about the strike of medical teachers. They reached the outpatient department as they did not find professors, associate professors and assistant professors in different specialities. However, resident doctors and medical officers continued to work in the OPD. 
 
 “We are doing whatever possible we can do for the patients in OPD and indoor wards,” Dr Manish Loyal, Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors (JARD) said.
 
 The strike of medical teachers affected surgeries in the hospital. SMS hospital officials said that surgeries have also been postponed.
 
 “We have come from Dausa for surgery of my cousin. But, here the doctors are not on duty. We are facing a lot of difficulty. Now we will go back home without any treatment,”  , an attendant of a patient at SMS hospital said.
 
 The patients were seen returning without getting any proper treatment. Another patient’s attendant from Jhotwara, Sangeet Singh said, “My wife has pain in her limb but here senior doctors are absent in the hospital. So, we are going back. The government must impose ban on such strikes of doctors, as it is directly related to the patients.”
 
 He said that often doctors go on strike alleging that attendants of patients beaten them but now they have gone on strike protesting against government. He said, “Why patients should suffer when there are various other peaceful ways of expressing protest.”
 
 A large number of patients were seen sitting outside the SMS hospital hoping that the strike will call off soon and they will get proper treatment from senior doctors.
