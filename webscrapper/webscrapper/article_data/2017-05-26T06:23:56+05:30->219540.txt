KOLKATA: The legendary pioneer of modern Indian sculpture,  , spent his last years in a state of depression and creative crisis, due to the rejection of his ideas by the public authorities who commissioned sculptures from him. He was apparently a complete emotional wreck when he died in 1980. Fora while now, art historian R Sivakumar has been researching into the artist’s final years of turmoil. Sivakumar’s findings are set to be published in the form of a book on Saturday at a programme organized by city artists and art critics to celebrate Ramkinkar, two days after his  .

 Ramkinkar’s last notable work, Mill Call (1956), a creation adorning the Visva-Bharati campus in Santiniketan, is perhaps the last sculpture he created independently. Trouble started when he began accepting commissioned work from public authorities. One such important work was the Yaksha-Yakshini sculpture at the entrance of Reserve Bank of India, Delhi. He couldn’t finish the work within the stipulated funds When he asked for more, he was snubbed and shown the contract papers. His “Towards Kankalitala” a sculpture showing a goat-faced child being pulled towards the sacrificial altar to be beheaded by two humans, that he planned to place in front of VBU was not allowed by the university authorities. Later, the CMDA (now KMDA) commissioned ‘Rajpath’ for which he had sculptured a scene showing a poor family in distress but it did not find its place either. These, and more episodes will be read out by Sivakumar, who is also the head of art history at V-B. “Taking freedom away from Ramkinkar means taking the soul out of him. He just couldn’t come to terms with him,” Sivakumar said.
 
 The programme will also see several of Ramkinkar’s never seen sketches.
