BHUBANESWAR: Speculations are rife about a new political equation in Odisha a day after   chief   met   at the latter's residence here. 

 Political observers are keenly watching the development as it comes a day after Naveen removed party's   as  's parliamentary party spokesperson.
 
 Speaking to the media about the meeting on Sunday, Soumya said there was absolutely no political discussion during the meeting that lasted for nearly an hour. "I discussed with the chief minister on certain issues like total prohibition, farmers' problems, returning money to small investors and effective use of Odia in official communication. I requested the chief minister to resolve these issues through debate and discussion," Soumya said.
 
 He scotched the rumour of joining the BJD. "Gone are those days when we were doing politics on the basis of party and leaders. I believe in issue-based politics," he added. 
 
 Soumya converted Aama Odisha, a socio-cultural outfit, into a political party ahead of the 2014 general and assembly elections. He also owns a leading vernacular daily.
 
 Though his political party is yet to taste electoral victory, Soumya has a substantial number of followers in several pockets. Blood donation, especially in villages, and interventions for promotion and development of Odia languages are the two major programmes of Aama Odisha.
 
 The BJD too clarified that there was no politics behind the meeting between Naveen and the Aama Odisha party chief. "Soumya babu has been involved in a number of social movements. So, he might have discussed all these issues with the chief minister and there is no harm in that. But I don't think any political issues were discussed," said BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb.
 
 According to political analysts, the meeting could have been an attempt by the chief minister to reach out to possible allies after party's not-so-impressive show in February panchayat elections.
