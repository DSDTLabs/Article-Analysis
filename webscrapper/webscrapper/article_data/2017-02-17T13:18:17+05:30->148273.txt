NEW DELHI: South Africa batsman   turns 33 today. Mr 360 degree, as he is sometimes called, has carved a special place in annals of international cricket with some incredible feats.

 Born on February 17, 1984, De Villiers was a sporting prodigy, excelling in different sports like rugby, golf, tennis, swimming and of course, cricket at the school level. Today, he's one of the most respected and popular batsmen globally and has earned legions of fans with his unique strokemaking. 
 
 Among his countless achievements on the cricketing field, one of the most astonishing happens to be the record for the fastest ever century in one-day internationals that came in January 2015. Against West Indies, De Villiers blasted a century in 31 balls to break the record set by New Zealand's   (36 balls). During his assault, De Villiers struck nine fours and 16 sixes and before he was out, had zoomed to 149 in just 44 balls. 
  
 After the mayhem, De Villiers revealed that he wanted   to go in at no 3 and double-checked with coach   whether he was sure of sending him. But Domingo had made up his mind and so, when   was dismissed for 128, De Villiers was on his way to create history at Johannesburg's New Wanderers Stadium. In 59 minutes, De Villiers smashed a 16-ball fifty and then a 31-ball 100. He also equaled the record for the most sixes in an ODI innings.
