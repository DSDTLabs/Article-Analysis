MUMBAI: An FIR was registered on Wednesday against The Viral Fever (TVF) CEO   for   his   after a 27-year-old a writer-director approached cops. 

 The police said they expected more women to come forward with the registration of the FIR.
 
 Several women had earlier complained about Kumar's alleged misconduct on social media, but TVF termed the allegations "ludicrous" and "defamatory". The writer-director has on her Facebook page accused Kumar of touching her inappropriately during a shoot. 
 
 In her post, the survivor has written: "I was shooting with him (Kumar)...when we met on the day of the shoot, I asked him if he had seen the links. To this he said 'why don't you come over to my place and we can watch them together. We can also watch a movie'. I politely evaded the question and continued briefing him about the shoot. As I talked, he placed his hand on my hand. In the middle of the shoot, he touched my shoulder tattoo and told me he finds it sexy. After every other shot, he would come over to the monitor to see how the shot looked, but at the same time graze his hand against my waist." Shailesh Pasalwar, senior inspector of MIDC police station, confirmed the development. TVF did not respond to TOI's questionnaire emailed to them.
