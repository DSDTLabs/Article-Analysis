AHMEDABAD: The demand for power has reached a record high as temperatures have gone up because of the   conditions prevailing across the state. The spike in consumption is being attributed to consumers switching on their air-conditioners and coolers to get respite from the scorching heat. According to the   (SLDC), Gujarat, the   on Friday reached 15,682MW at around 3pm, which is the highest ever demand recorded in the state.

 The demand for electricity remained high over the last three days with maximum consumption registered at 15,001.74MW and 15,485.47MW on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
 
 “There has been a sudden spurt in demand from residential and commercial segments as usage of air-conditioners and coolers as well as fans in households and offices has increased on account of prevailing heat conditions. The demand from agriculture segment, too, has surged as farmers need to draw more water for irrigation purposes,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy expert.
 
 The electricity demand had also shot up to a recovered level during last week of March when heatwave had gripped the state.
