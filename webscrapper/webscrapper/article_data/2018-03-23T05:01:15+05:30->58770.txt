The Bombay   in an interim order on Thursday stayed the order of the State Human Rights Commission directing the   to pay Rs 10 lakh   to a   victim. A division bench of Justice Shantanu Kemkar and Justice Makarand Karnik gave the state two weeks to file a reply. The bench was hearing a petition filed by the BMC challenging the commission order.

 The SHRC in January, had directed the   to pay Rs 10 lakh to Marilyn Remedios, who had fallen off a bike that her husband was riding when it hit a pothole in Mahim in 2015. Remedios had been in a coma for over 25 days. 
 
 Advocates D A Nalawade and Trupti Puranik, counsel for the BMC, contended that the SHRC order was not justified and was excessive. The BMC said there was no police complaint filed by the couple and no evidence that a pothole had caused the accident. tnn
