NAGPUR: Einstein’s work has fast forwarded the progress of human race by 60 years”, said retired   scientist   at  , on Monday.

 A special lecture was organized by the college’s department of physics, wherein Moharir condensed the entire history of scientific progress of humanity beginning with Greek philosopher Aristotle, in the fourth century, BC.
 
 College’s principal DK Burghate and head of the physics department HK Dahule were present on the occasion.
 
 “If it hadn’t been for Einstein, the television set wouldn’t have come to India till 2030,” Moharir said. He categorized the history of science into three categories: dark age, classical age and modern age. “The dark age was a time when logic was overwhelmed by superstition. There was some relief in the classical age where beliefs were proved wrong,” he said.
 
 The transition between ages is what Moharir calls ‘twilight transitions’ and puts   and   at the beginning of classical and modern ages, respectively. “Aristotle, one of very first known thinkers, put forth postulates of gravity and planetary motions. Though his postulates were later proved wrong as science advanced,” Moharir said.
 
 He highlighted a crucial point in history when Nicolaus Copernicus came up with the theory of heliocentrism which put the Sun at the centre of the solar system. 
 
 “Relativity, quantum physics and the Bose-Einstein statistical method were the three new branches of physics created by Einstein. His theories are relevant to everything that is around us, from the wrist watch to GPS systems. Without applying his theories, the software in our computers would have to be replaced every two hours,” Moharir added.
