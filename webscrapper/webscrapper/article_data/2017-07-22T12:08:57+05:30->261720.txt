JALANDHAR: Reacting to the recent disclosure in the UK's declassified files, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the first turbaned Sikh MP in the UK parliament, said full disclosures should be made about the actions of the country in relation to the Operation Bluestar in Amritsar in 1984. 

 Speaking to TOI over the phone from UK, Dhesi said the UK government was trying to cover up and the fresh revelations vindicated their earlier stand that Tory government had pushed the things under carpet three years ago too.
 
 Researcher   in his 'Vice' article quoted first woman Sikh MP of UK and chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for British Sikhs, Preet Kaur Gill, saying, "Clearly this would suggest that the Heywood review was a whitewash - he had access to these files but failed to mention that Britain briefed India's top brass on counter-insurgency."
 
 Amrik Singh Gill, chair of Sikh Federation UK, said, "It now emerges chief of army staff (COAS) General Vaidya, who led the Indian army operation in 1984, received confidential briefing on counter-insurgency the same year. 
 
 Sadly this suggests there was direct British army involvement in assisting in the 1984 Sikh genocide. With a third of files being kept secret, the foreign office is doing its best to hide the truth, but the picture that is gradually emerging suggests it is only a matter of time before ministers are forced to agree to an independent judge-led public inquiry."
 
 "It is clear to us the Heywood review was woefully inadequate. We believe a majority of MPs are on our side with the   and Scottish   now on record, and a sufficient number of Conservative MPs having previously told us they support our campaign," the Sikh Federation leader said.
 
 Both Dhesi and Gill are Labour MPs. In its manifesto, Labour had promised to hold public inquiry into British actions during events of 1984 in India. Labour deputy leader Tom   had also been strongly raising the issue for making full disclosures in this regard.
