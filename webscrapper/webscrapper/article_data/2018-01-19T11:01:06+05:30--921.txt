LUDHIANA: Now, when the option of 10% rebate in payment of property tax is over, civic officials are again going to start issuing notices to defaulters for clearing their dues. More than two lakh messages were already sent to tax defaulters, but even now, more than one lakh people did not file their returns with the department. Officials claimed they would now catch hold of the defaulters in the rest of the two months until March-end.

 The 10% rebate option was available until January 15, after which people are being asked to pay tax with 10% penalty. Officials claimed that in two days, 2,250 people filed their tax returns, and the department generated Rs24.5 lakh from tax-payers.
 
 As per MC records, maximum tax returns were filed in 2013-14, when 3.05 lakh returns were received, but after that, returns are decreasing gradually. For the year 2014-15, 2.13 lakh property tax returns were filed, for 2015-16, the MC received 1.92 lakh returns, for 2016-17, 1.61 returns were filed, and for the current financial year 2017-18, only 1.10 lakh returns have been filed so far.
 
 From the current year, MC has recovered Rs57 crore from tax collection. Officials claimed that the difference between tax returns filed every year is increasing gradually, and less people file their tax every year, as hardly any serious action has been taken against defaulters. Secondly, property tax is based on the self-assessment method, and people file returns according to their whims and fancies.
 
 However, officials are finding it tough to recover the pending amount in the coming months as well. An official claimed they would serve notices to defaulters, but once again, it would become a tough task to concentrate on recovery, because they would be busy with election duties, as the task to prepare the final draft of voter list for MC polls has been assigned to the staff.
 
 MC superintendent Vivek Verma said earlier, they were unable to recover the penalty and interest rate on pending dues, but now when the one-time settlement scheme is over, they can recover both the penalty and interest. He said they would now start sending notices to defaulters for clearing their dues.
