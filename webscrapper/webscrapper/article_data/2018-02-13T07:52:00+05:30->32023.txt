CHANDIGARH: Punjab technical education and industrial training   Charanjit Singh   on Monday ordered academic and administrative audit of government and private technical educational institutions across the state.

 Chairing a meeting of the technical education department, Channi said the need of the hour was to improve the credibility and merit of technical educational institutes so that the national and international industry could come forward for placements of students passing out of these institutes.
 
 He added that the report of the academic and administrative audits of government and private industrial training institutes and polytechnic colleges would be submitted by March 31. Thereafter 15 days would be given to institutes to remove various shortcomings. The minister said the whole audit process would be completed by May 31 and if these institutes fail to fulfil the terms and conditions, then action would be initiated against them. Even the technical education board could de-affiliate such defaulting institutes.
 
 The state government has also decided to set up a system to monitor examination centres of government and private technical education institutes online through   cameras. The technical education department and the board have been directed to ensure online working of CCTV cameras. Channi said this system would control copying in examination and the board officials would be able to monitor the examination centres from the head office. All private and government ITIs and polytechnic colleges have been warned of action against them for failing to install CCTV cameras.
