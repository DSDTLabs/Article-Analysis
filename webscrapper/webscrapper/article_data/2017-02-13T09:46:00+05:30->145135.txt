Bengaluru: A letter claiming to be from a whistleblower in Infosys and which is now in the public domain charges the company with not having obtained necessary approvals, including from shareholders, for the Rs 17.38-crore severance payment to former CFO  .

 The charge is similar to the one made by Infosys’ founders and which they have used to demand changes to the board. Co-founder N R  , in an interaction with TOI last week, had wondered about the reason for this payment. “When the former CFO Rajiv Bansal left, should he have got 30 months severance pay? That is 10 times the norm at Infosys. What is the real reason behind such an extraordinary payment?” he asked. 
 
 The whistleblower’s letter makes similar points and demands that the minutes be disclosed of the audit committee and board meetings where Bansal’s severance payment was approved. The letter also makes a number of allegations, including about improprieties in the $200-million acquisition of Panaya in 2015, but did not provide any evidence.
 
 Asked about the letter, Infosys said the content of the letter is malicious and is intended to harm the reputation of the company. “The   strongly refutes any allegations of impropriety made in this letter. All the matters on which allegations have been made have been scrutinized by the Board and by external investigators, and details of these investigations have also been disclosed publicly,” a statement from the company said.
