HYDERABAD: The demand for implementation of MMTS Phase II is intensifying in the wake of budgetary allocation to   (SCR). Members of Suburban Train Travellers' Association, Malkajgiri are pressing the railways to start the   between Bolarum and Malkajgiri after one of the daily services in the section was suspended . 

 SCR sources said that the DEMU (diesel multiple electric unit) will remain cancelled till March 21 due to apron works at Platform No. 7 of Secunderabad. Hence, passengers have to depend on two existing trains, which are jam-packed. 
 
 Noor Ahmed Ali, general secretary of the association, said the 10km stretch between Malkajgiri and Bolarum has been electrified. "We are waiting for the commissioner of safety to inspect and issue a certificate," Ahmed Ali told TOI.
