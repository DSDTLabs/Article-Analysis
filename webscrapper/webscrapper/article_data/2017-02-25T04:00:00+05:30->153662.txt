SURAT: Hundreds of passengers from the   are unhappy over Air India’s (AI) decision to stop bookings for the morning   between Surat and Delhi from March 26 until May 31. 

 Many frequent flyers from the city were planning their summer vacations in the northern states, but the sudden change in the morning schedule of Airbus has come as a big jolt to them. 
 
 Recently, AI had introduced morning Airbus between Surat and Delhi following strong representation from airport groups and MPs from Surat and Navsari. The Airbus, according to the airport groups, was getting more than 85 per cent passenger traffic to and from Surat on a daily basis. 
 
 ‘Member of We Want Working Airport at Surat’ (WWWAS)   said, “There is no logic for shutting the morning Airbus operations in the summer schedule, when the AI management is aware of the business potential from the city. We have written to the AI’s chairman and managing director urging him to restore the Airbus operation in the morning. This will affect a large number of people, who are travelling to Delhi for business and other purposes on a daily basis.”
 
 Sources said   has announced relaunch of its services from Surat from March 26. The airline will be operating morning and evening flights connecting Surat and Delhi. 
 
 “We doubt there is something fishy going on between SpiceJet and AI. When SpiceJet is launching services, AI has stopped accepting bookings for the morning Airbus,” said a member of WWWAS.
 
 The AI management has not cited any reasons for stopping the bookings. No AI official was available in the city for comment.
