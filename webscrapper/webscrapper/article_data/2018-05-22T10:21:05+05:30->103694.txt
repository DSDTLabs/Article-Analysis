Chandigarh: Calling the leakage of molasses into Beas an ‘ecological massacre,’ Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president   on Monday wrote a letter in this regard to the Union environment minister Harsh Vardhan. 

 He has demanded arrest of the management of Chadha   and Industries Private Limited at Kiri Afgana village in   district.
 
 Leakage of molasses from the factory had caused death of thousands of fish in Beas river on May 17.
 
 The SAD president accused the state government of “patronizing an environmental massacre in Punjab by turning a blind eye towards the massive and man-made ecological disaster caused by the Chadha sugar industries and owners of the distillery.” Sukhbir also raised the demand that a central team from the Union ministry of environment should be deputed for an on-the-spot study of the situation in Punjab and Rajasthan.
 
 The former deputy chief minister said the mill was owned by highly-connected political leader who is also religious adviser to the Punjab chief minister. “The grave irony of the tragedy authored by a religious adviser of the chief minister is that it has led to the contamination of the sacred Kali Bein which is historically associated with the life of Guru  ,” he added.
 
 Sukhbir said the scale of compensation should be established to be paid to the affected people and the burden of this compensation should be borne by the guilty industrialist.
