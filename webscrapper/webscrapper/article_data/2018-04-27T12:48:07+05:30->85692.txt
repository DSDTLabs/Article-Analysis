Not many know that   is a brilliant makeup artist herself. The actress, who is playing Miss   in the serial Protidan, does her makeup all by herself. “Shimul, my original character, has become Miss Briganza now, as she is on a mission.  , our makeup artist used to do the makeup before, which took about an hour. But now, I do it myself. I have always been into classical dancing, so I know the nitty-gritties of makeup well. I love playing   as it has lot of layers — Shimul became   and now she is Miss Briganza — and every time her body language and acting style changes with each avatar,” said Sandipta.
