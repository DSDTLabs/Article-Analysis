Vadodara: When revellers began swinging to the garba tunes from Thursday night, they matched steps to a new garba. But it won’t be in reverence for Ma Amba or Lord Krishna. Rather, the new garba will encourage people and audiences to cast their vote in the upcoming assembly polls. 

 Vadodara district administration on Thursday released a CD of this unique garba in the city. 
 
 “The election commission had asked the administration to spread awareness about voting during Navratri that is a very popular festival among Gujaratis, especially youngsters. So the administration joined hands with M S University’s performing arts faculty to prepare a garba that would inspire people to cast their vote in the polls,” said district administration officials. 
 
 The garba ‘Vote daishu, vote daishu, vote daishu re, kevo desh joiye a nakki karshu re’ (We will cast vote and decide how we want our country to be) has been written by Dhruti Mankodi while Dr Rakesh Dave from the performing arts faculty has sung the song with his students. Rahul Ranade has set the tune of the garba. “The district administration has contacted about 30 garba venues in and around the city and asked them to play this garba from tonight,” an official added. 
 
 Also, the administration has prepared nine different pledges for nine nights of Navratri. Organizers have been asked to announce these pledges during garba and ask the revelers and organizers to take the pledge that include registering for voting, checking accuracy of one’s information on voting list and details of Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT). 
 
 The administration will be contacting more garba organizers in the up and coming days and will ask them to play the ‘election garba’.
