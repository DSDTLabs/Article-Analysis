NEW DELHI: The opposition may move the impeachment motion against the Chief Justice of India on Friday after a meeting in the  . The move would come in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment dismissing the demand for an investigation into the death of CBI judge B H Loya. 

 
 Leader of opposition in   Ghulam Nabi Azad has invited at 11 am the representatives of all opposition parties that had petitioned President   for an investigation into Loya’s death in February. 
 
 Azad has an appointment with Rajya Sabha chairman   around noon. The motion for removal of CJI Dipak Misra was first suggested in the wake of the January 12 press conference of the four senior-most Supreme Court judges. Congress on Thursday attacked the SC judgment as a “sad letter day” while underlining that the four SC judges had mentioned the case as a matter of concern in their press conference. Opposition leaders said the issue was on the agenda of Friday’s meeting. 
 
 Crucially, some allies are unlikely to turn up for the meeting as they have engagements in their strongholds.   said it was busy with panchayat elections in West Bengal and would not join the discussions. 
 
 IUML of Kerala said it could not make it to the capital at such short notice. The motion for removal of the CJI was high on the opposition agenda during the Budget session but some key regional parties had refused to sign up for the drastic step, resulting in it being paused during the last week of   this month. 
 
 However, the discussions appear to have resumed in the wake of the Loya judgment. The petition has already been signed by around 70 MPs during the Parliament session.
