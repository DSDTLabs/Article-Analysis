KOLKATA:   did not feature in the National Institutional Ranking Framework ( ) because institutes that offered only science and humanities courses were not considered. Also, the fledgling university, now barely seven years old, did not have the track record like the ones built by other universities over time.

 In a clarification by NIRF to Presidency University vice-chancellor Anuradha  , the ranking body pointed out like Presidency , only a handful of institutes offered courses related to humanities and science only. “Very few institutions under the category had applied for the ranking,“ said a source.
 
 With the categories being set as “engineering“, “management“, “universities“, “colleges“ and “pharmacy“, Presidency officials said they could not have applied under any section other than “university“. Yet, several parameters based on which the ranks were granted were not relevant to Presidency . “We, being a nascent institution, could not mention the number of PhDs, IPR and patents filed, published, granted and licensed, executive development program, which were very important aspects of the ranking parameters,“ added a university source.
 
 Some of the parameters where Presidency University updated data on its website, showing its performances on a par with any other top university are: student strength, including doctoral students, faculty-student ratio, student diversity and women students. “I hope the process will be more inclusive in future,“ Lohia said.
