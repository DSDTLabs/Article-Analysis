Ahmedabad: After three years of slide, exports from special economic zones (SEZs) in Gujarat are expected to buck the trend by clocking a growth, although marginal, in current fiscal. Exports from functional SEZs in state are likely increase to Rs1.37 lakh crore in 2016-17 as compared to Rs1.35 lakh crore in 2015-16.

 “SEZ exports from Gujarat touched Rs1.25 lakh crore in February this year. We expect the value of exports by the end of 2016-17 to cross last year’s mark of Rs1.35 lakh crore. The growth rate might be 1% or so but it will buck the trend of decline in exports over the past couple of years,” said Upendra Vasishth, zonal development commissioner, Gujarat (SEZs and EoUs), Union ministry of commerce and industry.
 
 The uptrend in overall exports from SEZs is largely attributed to growth in exports by many SEZs operating in the state. During the current fiscal, Zydus SEZ (Pharmez) in Ahmedabad, Dahej SEZ in Bharuch and GIDC Apparel Park in Ahmedabad have seen their exports rise by 41.11%, 29.68% and 34.30% respectively as compared to the same period last fiscal.
 
 Kandla SEZ, Adani’s Mundra SEZ, Sterling group’s SEZ in Vadodara and GIFT SEZs are among the ones, which have registered an increase in their exports. Gujarat currently has 19 operational SEZs. Gujarat SEZs will end the current financial year with improved exports despite the fact that Reliance Jamnagar SEZ, the single biggest contributor to Gujarat’s overall exports from SEZs, witnessing a dip of 5% in exports as on February end.
 
 “GST Council’s decision to treat supplies to special economic zones at par with exports will also give a major boost to SEZ exports,” he added.
