NEW DELHI: On Monday, the equity markets opened on a flat note in a bid to recover from the 500-point slump it witnessed on Friday.

 
 30-share BSE   opened with a handsome gain of more than 90 points at 33,268.97 but the volatile nature of the market meant that the index soon slipped into the red and was down 70 points at 10 am. The broader 50-share NSE   too, was down 0.30 per cent.
 
  jitters could still be felt on the Street as the metal sub-index on NSE was down 1.70 per cent as report emerged that India may move   against import tariff hike by US on aluminium and steel. Bank and auto stocks were also losing substantially.
 
 Coal India, Adani Ports and major oil stocks were losing the most while Larsen & Toubro, Hindustan Unilever and Maruti Suzuki were the major gainers.
