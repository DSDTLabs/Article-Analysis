PUNE: A man was booked on Monday for raping his 13-year-old daughter at home around 9am on Sunday. 

 “The girl and her father were alone at home when he raped her. He warned her not to tell her mother about the incident. But she told her mother everything when she returned home,” said   police sub-inspector Kalyani Shinde.
 
 Shinde said, “The wife had a heated dispute with the suspect and he left the house. The mother lodged an FIR against her husband under Section 376 (2) [rape] of the Indian Penal Code and other charges of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. A police team visited the suspect’s residence but he could not be found. A hunt has been launched to arrest him.”
 
 The girl is a Standard IX student. Her father does odd jobs and mother works as a domestic help.
