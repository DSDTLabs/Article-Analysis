MAPUSA: Mandrem Congress MLA   criticised Pernem MGP MLA and tourism minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar over the recent drama at the   site. 

 Sopte warned the minister over stopping of the work of the airport in future. 
 
 “I challenge the minister. He should come clear about his act of stopping the work and allowing it to resume after 24 hours. The minister should not underestimate Pednekars as illiterates. We suspect and my charge is that the hotel lobby from south Goa, which has been opposing the project right from the beginning, may have approached or come into contact with the minister to stop the work,” Sopte said.
 
 “The minister is from Margao, but he should not forget that the people of Pernem have voted and elected him. Not only this minister, but in future if anybody tries to stop the work, all the youth from Pernem will be taken to Mopa for agitation in support of the project,” Sopte said.
 
 The state government’s greenfield international airport project at Mopa had received a jolt recently, when Azgaonkar stalled the construction work. Azgaonkar, who visited the site along with his supporters, had claimed that since the project is not providing any employment benefits to local residents, he is opposed to the project. A day later, he offered a coconut at the site and allowed work to continue.
