SHIMLA: In what could open a pandora’s box and throw a volley of questions at the Virbhadra Singh government, Sushma Sahu, a member of the   member on Saturday claimed that she was told by the elder sister of the minor girl who was gangraped and murdered in Kothkai that   chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s wife   had urged her not to press for a CBI probe during her visit to their house. Addressing mediapersons in Shimla, Sahu also questioned police probe into the case. Alleging that the government was trying to save some influential people in the case, Sahu said the commission would submit its report to CBI, which is now investigating the case.

 Pratibha Singh on the other hand said her statement was twisted by the NCW member. The CM’s wife said that after the incident she had gone to meet the family of the deceased girl and during interaction her entire family, including her father, mother and sister, had expressed satisfaction in the police probe. “I told them if they trust the police investigation then why should the investigation be handed over to some other agency? The state government had deputed officials right from SHO to SP for the investigation,” she said. 
 
 Sahu, continuing with her attack, said police had no answers to many questions and there were loopholes in the investigation. She said that the commission had summoned state DGP but he was on leave and instead an ADGP was sent, who had no answer to any of the queries. Sahu said she also met  , widow of the accused Suraj Singh who was killed in the police lockup.
