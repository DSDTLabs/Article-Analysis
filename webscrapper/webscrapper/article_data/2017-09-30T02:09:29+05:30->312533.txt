NEW DELHI: As   ( ), the central paramilitary force tasked with guarding Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, also gets deployed in conflict zones like Jammu & Kashmir and Left-wing extremism-hit states, its director general   perceives the training of its personnel to suit varied needs of the new theatres as the biggest challenge.

 “SSB has seen massive expansion from just 25 battalions in 2001 to 69 batallions now. It is now deployed not only on the international border with Nepal and Bhutan but also engaged in LWE areas (seven battalions deployed across Bihar, Chhattisgarh and  ) and J&K (six battalions).
 
 Recently, a sizeable number of our   were deployed in Punjab and Haryana (to manage the unrest following conviction of Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim). In each of these different areas, the approach of the jawans and officers, their training and weaponry has to be different,” Ramasundaram, who is retiring at the end of this month, told mediapersons on Friday.
 
 She said it is this need for varied training depending on the theatre of deployment that has prompted SSB to develop and introduce multiple training modules. According to Ramasundaram, the first-ever woman to head a paramilitary force, SSB has a specific module for personnel manning border outposts as they need to detect and deal with trans-border crimes while maintaining the “friendly borders” approach. In J&K, however, she said the SSB personnel need to be aware of sensitivities of the local people and adapt to judicious use of non-lethal weapons.
 
 “We are trying to constantly prepare our personnel for the new roles by taking up case studies and through interactions with officers of sister forces who have handled situations unique to the area... We are developing different training modules to help our personnel develop the right approach for handling duties in J&K and LWE. This is the challenging job for any force and more so for an expanding forces like SSB,” she stated.
