MUMBAI: Tata Trusts along with People for Animals (PFA) is setting up a veterinary   in Navi Mumbai. 

 The 9,000 sq m animal-care facility in Kalamboli with a total holding capacity of 235, will open doors in two years, a joint statement from Tata Trusts and PFA said. 
 
 Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata had spoken about his plan to set up a veterinary hospital five years ago when he had relinquished his official responsibilities as chairman of Tata Sons. This plan is now taking shape with Tata Trusts collaborating with PFA for the project. While Maneka Gandhi’s PFA brings land to the project, Tata Trusts will build a four-storey hospital on the plot. 
 
 The Kalamboli facility will cater to all domestic and farm animals with treatments and services to be offered at affordable rates. The animal-care centre, which will have an intensive care unit, recovery rooms and imaging and pathology services, will offer comprehensive medical care including orthopaedics, dentistry and trauma surgery.
 
 Ratan Tata, an ardent dog lover, feels that there are inadequate veterinary care facilities in the country. New York, for instance, has 33 full-time animal hospitals while London has 15. Mumbai, on the other hand, has just one. For the Kalamboli hospital, Tata Trusts and PFA have roped in Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, which will offer design and operational expertise to the facility. Statistics showed that there are at least 50,000 registered pets, 70,000 unregistered pets, 2 lakh stray dogs and 3 lakh stray cats in Mumbai. For all these pets and other animals, there are only two hospitals, one in central Mumbai and another in Thane.
