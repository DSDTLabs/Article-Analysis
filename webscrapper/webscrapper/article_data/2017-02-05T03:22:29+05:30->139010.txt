KOLKATA: The   government has decided to remove a disparity handed down by the  . Under the existing rules, a municipality/corporation member is entitled to contest assembly or Lok Sabha polls and retain his membership in both the local body and assembly/Parliament while an elected functionary in the panchayat system can’t do so.

 A case in recent past is panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee himself. Mukherjee continued as Kolkata mayor and also retained his membership in the  . On the contrary,   sabhadhipati and CPM leader Braja Mukherjee had to put in his papers to continue as an MLA. 
 
 “Rules can’t be different for municipalities/corporation and panchayat. If municipality members can retain their posts after being elected MLA/MP why can’t panchayat members do so? I have brought this discrepancy to the CM’s notice. We need an amendment of the West Bengal Panchayat Act and Rules to set it right. The CM has given her consent. Now I have to prepare a draft proposal and get the Cabinet approval before placing it in Assembly,” said Subrata Mukherjee. The amendment is likely in the next assembly session.
