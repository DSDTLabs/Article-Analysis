CHENNAI: In what turned out to be his final brief as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, O Panneerselvam surveyed the post-oil spill restoration work underway at the coast in Ernavur and Thiruvottiyur on Sunday. Panneerselvam said that he expected the restoration work to be completed in two days’ time.

 Since the incident on January 28, over 100 tonnes of sludge had been removed from the beaches by teams of the Coast Guard, corporation, fire and rescue services, fisheries and port personnel besides volunteers and NGOs. A statement from the government said that 5,700 people had been working towards clearing the sludge.
 
 “Nearly 95% of the work has been completed in areas that fall under Chennai and Kancheepuram districts. In Tiruvallur district, there is still about 10% of the work remaining,” Panneerselvam said.
 
 Panneerselvam said that the state government would discuss with the Centre about compensating fishermen for the loss of livelihood due to the oil spill. “The compensation sum would be demanded from the shipping company,” he said.
