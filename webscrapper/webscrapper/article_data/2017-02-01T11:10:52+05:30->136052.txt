PANAJI: Stating that Congress vice-president   has nothing to offer Goa, Union defence minister   on Tuesday said Gandhi’s promise of a ‘corruption-free government is a big joke’. 

 “Every Goan knows that when the Congress was in power, all its Goa coordinators used to carry suitcases,” Parrikar said speaking to reporters at Panaji.
 
 He also said that even though the central government is not in the hands of the Congress at present, the party has been involved in a scam of Rs 12 lakh crore. “In the few Congress-ruled states, such as Uttarakhand and  , chief ministers are facing serious corruption charges. Even in Karnataka, a recent income tax search revealed some Rs 150 crore in the possession of a minister. With allegations against its CMs, I think the Congress offering a corruption-free government to   have seen seven years of corruption and mining scamsis a big joke and no one has taken it seriously,” Parrikar said 
 
 The defence minister also said the opposition does not have any platform or issues specifically to deliver to Goa, and that the BJP will get a 2/3 majority in the polls. tnn
