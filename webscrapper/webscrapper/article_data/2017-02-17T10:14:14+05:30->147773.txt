PATNA: With improvement in visibility conditions, four — one   and three IndiGo — flights resumed operations from the city’s   after a gap of nearly three months on Thursday.

 While IndiGo has resumed three morning flights — 6E-494 on Delhi-Patna route, 6E-634 on Patna-Calcutta-Goa route and 6E-339 on Patna-Lucknow-Mumbai route, Air India has resumed the operation of an evening flight (AI- 415/416) that operates on Patna-Delhi route.
 
 Flights are not allowed to land at the airport unless the visibility is at least 1,200 metres. Accordingly, all four airlines operating from the city airport — Air India, IndiGo, GoAir and   — had cancelled or rescheduled their morning flights and added flights in the afternoon under their winter schedule from the first week of November. Changes in timings were also made for the evening flights.
 
 “The schedule for operation of flights was revised today. Now, the number of flights operating from the city airport has increased from 22 to 26,” assistant general manager (air traffic management)   said, adding the number of flights was likely to go up to 32 under the summer schedule from March 26.
 
 GoAir, Air India and Airbus have proposed to increase the number of flights operating from the city airport to eight and four respectively.
 
 Meanwhile, efforts are on for the expansion of the airport terminal building. Sources in the civil aviation directorate informed that a proposal had been sent to the revenue board for transfer of 11.5 acres of land near the airport to the   (AAI) for expansion of the building. The Union cabinet on January 24 gave its approval to transfer of 11.35 acres of land to the state government by way of exchanging equivalent land of AAI at Anisabad.
 
 “We expect the land mutation and other formalities to be completed from the end of the Patna district administration within a fortnight,” said a senior official in the civil aviation directorate.
