VADODARA: Three persons died and five others were injured when a luxury bus collided with another bus near   on Thursday morning. 

 The accident happened when one of the buses was parked by the roadside near the bridge at about 4.30 am. Police said that one bus was travelling towards Surat and another was heading to Mumbai. 
 
 Drivers of one of the bus,   told police that he had parked his bus by the roadside as one of the passengers had to attend nature’s call. 
 
 Meanwhile, another bus came from behind and crashed into the parked one. “Two of them died on the spot while one succumbed in the hospital,” the police said. 
 
 Three passengers travelling in the parked bus suffered injuries, said Makarpura police sub-inspector, V N  .
 
  “One of the deceased has been identified as Shivgiri Goswami. We have contacted the transport firm to track down families of the other two. We may get their details by Friday morning,” Mahida told TOI. Investigating officials are also unsure if one of the deceased was driver of the speeding bus. 
 
 NH 8 that passes from the outskirts of the city witnesses several accidents throughout the year. Intersections to the city’s entry have higher risk of accidents as vehicles take turn at a high speed. 
 
 City police commissioner   told TOI, “I have asked a team of experts to study the area and see if we need to do traffic engineering to avoid accidents. Some professors from M   too will help us.”
