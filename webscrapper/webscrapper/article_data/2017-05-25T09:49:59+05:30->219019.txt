PANAJI: The consumer disputes redressal forum,  , has the jurisdiction to decide the compensation claims of two passengers who were denied boarding passes by Air India on their way from Delhi to  , forcing them to return to Goa, the state consumer disputes redressal commission (SCDRC) has ordered.

 The commission quashed and set aside the December 2016 order of the North Goa consumer disputes redressal forum that had dismissed the complaints of two foreign nationals at the admission stage itself on the ground that it lacked territorial jurisdiction.
 
  nationals Alain Beelen, 62, and his son, Gary Beelen, 14, purchased their tickets from Air India, through its agent, Masala Travel Company, at Calangute, in 2016, for their travel from Delhi to Tontonta Airport, Noumea, with a transit stop at Sydney. 
 
 The father-son duo, with confirmed tickets, were denied boarding passes by the Air India counter at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, in April 2016, with an Air India officer stating that they “required transit visas from the department of immigration of Australia”. 
 
 The Belgium national petitioned North Goa consumer disputes redressal forum seeking compensation. The application was ejected. 
 
 The commission stated that the North Goa forum had not looked into all the material produced by the complainants and pointed out that one of the passengers from France was issued a boarding pass after she started shouting and crying and another Indian passenger was also given a boarding pass after he refused to leave the plane until it was issued to him.
