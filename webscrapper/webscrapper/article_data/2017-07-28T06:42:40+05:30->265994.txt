PUNE: Nearly 10% of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s   for last fiscal, amounting to over Rs 30 crore, lapsed as the money could not be utilised due to lack of proper planning.

 The education board of   ( ) had submitted a Rs 377-crore   for 2017-2018. The budget for the last fiscal (2016-17) was Rs 341 crore and for 2015-16, it was Rs 286 crore. Elected members want an extra Rs 36 crore be spent on education in the current financial year. The board had not proposed any new schemes, but emphasised on augmentation of facilities at civic schools.
 
 Elected members cutting across party lines aired their concerns over mismanagement of schools at the general body meeting of PMC recently. “The delay in tendering system has caused the lapse. The legal battles over providing educational material led to the delay. Many students studying in civic schools have not received materials for around two years. It is a double blow for the municipal corporation’s education board,” said Deepak Mankar, a PMC corporator.
 
 “Steps such as direct benefit transfer (DBT) have been planned as it will help in better utilisation of funds given to the students. We will make sure that the budget is utilised to the maximum,” said Murlidhar Mohol, chairman of the standing committee, while speaking to TOI.
 
 Ulka Kalaskar, head of PMC’s account department, said that technical issues can cause funds to lapse. “Delays in estimates or tendering can lead to funds getting lapsed. Even issuance of work orders can cause postponement,” she said.
