AMARAVATI: The 1,066 prisoners at the 152-year-old Amravati   are being denied proper medical attention in absence of a regular medical officer.

 Deputy superintendent   told TOI that the jail administration has been pursuing the matter for long but the state government isn’t bothered. “We have also written to the IG, but so far nothing has been done,” he said.
 
 Majority of the complaints the jail administration receives from the inmates are regarding their health, especially skin-related diseases and psychiatric issues. “A medical officer from district general hospital visits the jail every Thursday and students from a local dental college too come for check-up of inmates. A psychiatrist too visits the jail every Wednesday,” said Gaikwad. 
 
 “There are separate barracks for inmates with psychiatric disorders and skin infections. Also, there is a separate barrack for old aged prisoners. Every prisoner who enters the jail is pathologically tested,” said Gaikwad.
 
 The jail administration has taken various measures to reform and rehabilitate inmates. “The inmates had made furniture for the recently inaugurated building of   and Sessions Court. This year, a record 100 inmates have registered for degree programmes at   and 50 at Yeshwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University. With the help of NGOs, we have also been trying to bring about a positive change in them,” said Gaikwad.
