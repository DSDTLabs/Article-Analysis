PATNA: One Sonu Kumar (22) was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly throwing acid on an 18-year-old girl near GPO roundabout in the city on Monday evening. He was a named accused in the FIR lodged on the victim’s statement, DSP (law and order) Shibli Nomani said.

 Kotwali police station SHO Ram Shankar said Sonu had purchased the acid two days back. The container was recovered from his sister’s rented accommodation in Macchli Gali under the Shastri Nagar police station area. Sonu resides there. He worked as salesman at a garment shop in Raja Bazaar and was a Class VI pass-out. The SHO said both had been Facebook friends for the last four months and Sonu used to harass the girl on the phone and social media platforms “for friendship and she ignored”. Sonu had threatened her with dire consequences for not befriending him.
 
 “Agar tum mujhse dosti nahi rakhogi to mein tumhe kisi or se bhi dosti karne layak nahi rahne dunga. (If you won’t befriend me, you will not be able to make friends with anyone else),” the SHO quoted the   message sent by Sonu to the victim.
 
 On Monday, Sonu trailed the girl, who was returning home with his maternal uncle Dheeraj Kumar (24). He threw acid on the girl and Dheeraj causing them burn injuries. Both were admitted to PMCH. The girl, along with her mother Poonam Devi and a sister, lives at a rented accommodation near Baba Chowk in Patel Nagar under the Shastri Nagar police station area.
 
 “The accused used to trail the victim anywhere she moved,” Nomani said. “She left home around 3.30pm and went to meet Dheeraj near GPO to take some monetary help,” Nomani said.
 
 Her mother told TOI at PMCH that Sonu made 12 calls to her daughter on Monday. “Sonu called her and said he knew she was at Rajbanshi Nagar,” she said, adding Sonu always kept an eye on her daughter. She also said her daughter used to block the cellphone numbers of Sonu, but he used to harass her from different numbers every time.
