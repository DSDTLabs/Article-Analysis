LUCKNOW: For Premnath, sitting in an air-conditioned coach in the newly-launched   that stops at  , it was a “historical” journey, literally. He is overjoyed to be able to reach Ayodhya, a place he says is connected by “history.”

 Premnath is one of the many passengers on the inaugural run of the train, launched by Prime Minister   on Thursday near Rameswaram. In its 2,913-km-long, 58-hour journey through six states, the   will connect the route that, in Ramayana, Lord Ram took to reach the “Ram Setu” to Lanka from Ayodhya. He feels though history connects the two places, no one thought of connecting the two. He said, “There are so many Hindu devotees in South who are craving to visit Ayodhya. And, I am sure people from eastern UP like Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Sultanpur, Azamgarh want to visit   as Lord Rama is closely associated with the two places. Once the train gains popularity, it will be quite full,” said Premnath, who boarded the train in Bangalore.
