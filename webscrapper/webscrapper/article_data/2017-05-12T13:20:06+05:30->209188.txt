RAJKOT: The health department of   ( ) on Thursday issued notices to retailers and wholesalers who have been selling ‘organic’ mangoes.

 According to RMC officials, they have come across many fruit-sellers who have put up boards saying that they were selling ‘organic’.
 
 “We have issued notices to these traders asking them to produce proof of the mangoes being organic as there is a standard procedure to get certification for the farm produce. One has to show that certificate before selling it in the name of ‘organic’ product. Many a times, fruit-sellers charge higher prices claiming that the mango on sale is an organic product which is cheating,” said an RMC official.
 
 RMC also asked those sellers to stop selling mango if they are not able to produce certificate from it.
 
 The civic body continued to crack down on   who are using calcium carbide to ripen it. According to an estimate, they have destroyed over 10,000kg mango in the last three weeks.
