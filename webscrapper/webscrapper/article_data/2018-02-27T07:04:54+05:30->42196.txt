HYDERABAD:   linkage to all government-offered welfare schemes and benefits can save $11 billion every year through reduced leakage and efficient gains, estimates   in its report on Digital Dividends-2016.

 
  
 These savings would be in addition to Rs 57,000 crore savings the Union government has already achieved through Aadhaar linkage to various welfare schemes.
 
 This was disclosed by Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive officer of the   (UIDAI) and also chairman of   (GSTN) at the two-day national conference on e-governance which started here on Monday.
 
 Pandey called upon state governments to link Aadhaar with every possible welfare scheme and governance activity to not only save money but also improve and expedite service delivery to the citizens.
 
 He stated that few years ago, 80 crore people in India, 60% of the population did not have a credible ID, but in the last 7 years over 1.2 billion people have been given the Aadhaar card, covering 99% adults.
 
 “Aadhaar has emerged as the world’s largest biometric ID programme. No contemporary ID programme of this scale has been attempted in the world so far,” he said. On apprehensions of vital personal information getting stolen, the UIDAI CEO said, with Aadhaar, it has become difficult to steal all 10 fingerprints and  . “Being a biometric-based digital ID, it cannot be stolen, lost, tampered or destroyed. Truly Aadhaar is one ID, which is like our soul, which is permanent and cannot be destroyed,” Pandey said.
 
 Union consumer affairs minister CR Chaudhary said 1.1 lakh gram panchayats have been linked with optical fibre in the country. “A change in the mind-set of people is required if e-governance has to be made effective and bring qualitative changes in people’s life. Through e-governance we can bring transparency, eliminate corruption and reduce time in delivery of services to citizens, he added.
