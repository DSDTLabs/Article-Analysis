 The exhibition of 35 impressionistic paintings was inaugurated by Kumkum Roy Choudhury, who was the chief guest on the occasion. "I cannot be partial towards any of the paintings as every artist has shown wonder on canvas. It was good to see that the footfall of youngsters is increasing in such exhibitions," she said.
 Jonu Prajapati’s sculptures made by using wire and thread, showcasing nature, became the highlight of the exhibition. The youngest artist among all, who belonged to Allahabad, received a lot of queries on how he had made it. A bonsai of the succulents and Aloe Vera made by   also gained people's attention.
 "I got to know a lot of new techniques used by the young artists. The artist tried to portray the whole city on a small canvas very beautifully," said Dr Vandana Sehgal, principal and dean faculty of architecture, AKTU, while seeing Krishna’s paintings.
