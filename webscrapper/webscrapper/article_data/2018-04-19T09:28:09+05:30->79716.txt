LUCKNOW: Magsaysay awardee and social activist   has sent a legal notice to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) seeking cancellation/withdrawal of affiliation to  , Indiranagar.

 Through his lawyer Shashank Singh, Pandey has alleged that the school is on a building whose land acquisition is illegal. He said his claim was based on an RTI query.
 
 The notice calls upon CISCE chief executive and secretary to issue a show-cause notice to   regarding suppression of information while receiving affiliation. It also seeks action or inquiry against the person involved in granting affiliation to the school without scrutiny and inspection, within 15 days of receipt of the notice.
 
 In case no response is received from CMS Indiranagar within 15 days, it seeks that the schoolâ€™s affiliation be revoked.
 
 According to rules, a school seeking affiliation should have adequate infrastructure to accommodate the number of pupils attending it. Classes should only be conducted on the premises for which affiliation is granted. The school should have minimum 2,000 sq mt of land, with buildings on one part and playgrounds on the remaining. Besides, a number of other facilities have been prescribed by CISCE.
 
 According to Pandey, CMS Indiranagar has a student strength of 1,100. In view of affiliation norms, he said the school did not have enough space to accommodate them.
