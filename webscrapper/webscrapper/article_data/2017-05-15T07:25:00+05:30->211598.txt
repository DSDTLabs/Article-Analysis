Sonipat: Three days after her mutilated body was found in Rohtak, politicians on Sunday made a beeline to the family house of the 21-year-old woman gang-raped and murdered. Right from early morning, villagers were surprised by the cavalcades of political leaders reaching this sleepy hamlet on Rohtak Road on Sonipat’s periphery. The scene had not changed much by the evening. Around 30 cops were deployed enroute to village to guide the VIP visitors. 

 From the Congress, former Haryana CM Bhupinder Hooda and state unit chief Ashok Tanwar met the family here. They attacked the state government over “poor law and order situation” in Haryana. From the incumbent party, woman and child development minister and local MLA Kavita Jain, Sonipat MP Ramesh Kaushik and state president Subhash Barala were seen. They expressed satisfaction on the pace of probe in the case. 
 
 “We have already said that this government has failed at all fronts. The family has also elaborated how they had to suffer to get their complaints heeded. We have asked the government to expedite the investigation and put the case on fast track trial and ensure hardest punishment for those involved. Our party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi have also expressed solidarity with family and anguish over the government’s failure to protect the innocents,” said Hooda.
 
 Minister Jain said that she was in touch with family and their relatives all along through her local representatives. She assured the rehabilitation of the family and all possible help from the government.
 
 “We have interacted with the family as well as the cops. Policemen were quick to respond and had helped the family. Our workers will also monitor the investigations and will be in touch with the family,” Kaushilk said.
