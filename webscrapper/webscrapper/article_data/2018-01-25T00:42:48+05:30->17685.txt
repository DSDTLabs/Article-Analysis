DAVOS: Maharashtra is likely to seek a compensation of Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 2,000 crore to make up for the   in goods and services tax collection in recent months, said chief minister   on Wednesday. He also suggested that the Centre and states should wait for the new tax regime to settle in firmly before extending it to petroleum products.

 “Ultimately, petroleum products will have to be brought in (under GST). Currently, it is the only area where states have some flexibility to adjust to manage their fiscal situation,” Fadnavis told TOI. He said that the state government was able to cover its revenue in the initial two months of   but has been seeing lower collections after that.
 
 Fadnavis, who is courting investors in the ski resort, said that the state was hoping to have a GDP of $1 trillion over the next few years and was banking on manufacturing and the creation of a financial sector hub to power the economy.
 
 On complaints about land and labour reforms in the country, Fadnavis said his state had initiated steps on both fronts. “We have moved on almost all aspects of labour reforms, barring one, allowing greater flexibility in winding up businesses employing over 100 workers. We are in talks with the labour unions and trying to convince them. Other states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have already moved on it.”
 
 The move was stalled in Maharashtra because of protests from the unions, which have hardened their position and want the limit to be reduced in the wake of rising automation, which is resulting in fewer jobs being created.
