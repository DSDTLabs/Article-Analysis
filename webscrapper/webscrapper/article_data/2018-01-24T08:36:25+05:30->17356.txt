MELBOURNE: World number one   limped into the media room for his postmatch conference a little after he left the Rod Laver Arena unable to complete his quarterfinal clash against the big-serving Croat  .

 He struggled to even sit down. “Is difficult to know exactly what it is, exactly what muscle. It just happened minutes ago. This type of injury is difficult to know immediately,” a visibly beaten Nadal said.
 
 “We need to wait a couple of hours. Tomorrow I am going to do a test, an MRI, then we will know.”
 
 The Spaniard said he started to tire in the third set. “But I was playing normal, no limitation. Then in the fourth set, at one movement, one drop shot I think, I felt something. I thought something happened, but I didn’t realize how bad.”
 
 Nadal, in pain and struggling to get his feelings together, said, “Is not the first time an opportunity that is gone for me. Today is an opportunity lost to be in the semifinals of a Grand Slam and fight for an important title for me.
 
 “In this tournament already happened a couple of times in my life. It’s a negative thing, but I don’t want to complain because it has happened to me more than to others,” he said.
 
 “On other hand, I was winning more than almost anyone. But who knows, if I didn’t have all these injuries...”
