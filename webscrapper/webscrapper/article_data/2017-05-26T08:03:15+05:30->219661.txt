AHMEDABAD:   on Thursday directed the   in Surat's   to   of a 17-year-old  . 

 Justice B N Karia permitted the rape survivor to undergo the abortion after a team of doctors opined, "...pregnancy can be terminated with slight risk and that this slight risk will be less as compared to the mental agony and physical risk of continuing the pregnancy till full term and delivering then."
 
 Since this case involves charges of rape, the HC asked the resident medical officer of the Surat hospital to hand over tissue drawn from the fetus for DNA identification to the investigating officer for onward transmission to the forensic science laboratory.
 
 Last week, the girl approached the HC through advocate Nachiket Dave and sought permission for the abortion. The victim and her family were not sure how advanced the pregnancy was. When the HC sought a medical opinion, it was revealed that the pregnancy was not beyond 20 weeks, the stage beyond which The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act prohibits abortion.
