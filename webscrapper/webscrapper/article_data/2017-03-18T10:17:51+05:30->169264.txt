KOLHAPUR: Former Union home minister and senior Congress leader   on Friday said   would soon be elevated to the post of party president. 

 "The   passed a resolution to make Rahul Gandhi the party president two months ago. We hope that this resolution will get approved soon. Demands for leadership change in our party has been made in the past too, in 1971, 1979 and 1989," Shinde said while addressing a press conference here.
 
 Speaking about the Congress debacle in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Shinde said, "Ups and downs are part of politics. In future, we will enter into alliances only with our natural partners."
 
 Shinde, who was in the city to felicitate writer Anuradha Gurav, accused the   of using money power to win elections and secure a majority where the mandate was against the party. He said the demand of leaders like Mayawati for an inspection of EVMs should be properly addressed.
 
 Shinde supported the demand of the Congress and the NCP that farmers' loans should be waived off. Since the last few days, the state assembly session has been paralysed over the demand by the opposition parties as well as the   to waive off the loans. 
 
 The government has said that if the loans are waived, there would not be adequate funds for infrastructure development.
 
 "The government is ignoring the fact that our farmers are contributing to the country's growth even in times of crises. If the government can waive loans of industrialists to the tune of Rs 35,000 crore, it should also waive off the loans taken by farmers," Shinde said.
