JAIPUR: The   issued notice to the state chief secretary, principal secretary (higher education), and registrar of the   (RU) for negligence in pursuing the order passed by the high court to fill up the vacant positions in the university. The notices were returnable by May 10. 

 The division bench of   and VK Vyas issued notice during the hearing of a PIL by Ram Briksh Singh over large number of posts of teaching and non-teaching posts lying vacant. 
 
 Following the PIL, the University agreed to fill up 217 out of the 327 faculty positions and 250 out of 374 non -teaching staff in in October 25. The registrar had filed an affidavit that all these agreed posts would be filled up by April 2017. 
 
 However the university have been dragging its feet and seeking   on one pretext or the other.
 
 The court said, "In our considered opinion, this is nothing but lethargic attitude on the part of University and the students are suffering. They are paying fees and not getting their education. That is how we are spoiling the future of the next generation by omission on the part of the respondent officers and the respondent University."
 
  This has to be viewed very seriously inasmuch as still for some of the posts, even procedure is not initiated so far, the court said.
