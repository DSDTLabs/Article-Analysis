Chennai: Unlike the troubles it is facing over its   in north India, the controversial Bollywood   ‘Padmaavat’, produced and directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, will have a   ride in   India, when it hits theatres on Thursday morning. It was to be released in around 600 screens across five states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the region. The film was released in Bengaluru on Wednesday and there were no reports of any untoward incident.

 For the release in the southern markets, the distributors, Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, are releasing the film in three languages – in its original version in Hindi and dubbed in Tamil and Telugu. It is also being released in 3D and IMAX versions to offer a wide choice to the audience in the south. 
 
 “There is no trouble whatsoever for the film’s release across south India and it is having a peaceful release in all the five southern states. As on Wednesday evening, it is getting released in about 600 screens across the region — 150 theatres in Tamil Nadu, 125 in Karnataka, 75 in Kerala and in about 225-250 theatres in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana combined,” a source in Viacom 18 Motion Pictures told TOI on the condition of anonymity.
 
  Even though slated for release on Thursday, multiplexes in the south had planned premiere shows for ‘Padmaavat’ from Wednesday evening onwards. “The response for the premiere shows is excellent, with several multiplexes offering at least two premiere shows on Wednesday evening onwards in the screens slated to release the film,” the source said.
 
  In Chennai, all leading multiplex screens had scheduled premieres shows and reported good response from public. But, almost all multiplex spokespersons did not want their theatres to be named. “There is absolutely   so far. But, it is better to be cautious,” they said, underlining the fear that the industry is made to go through in such cases.
