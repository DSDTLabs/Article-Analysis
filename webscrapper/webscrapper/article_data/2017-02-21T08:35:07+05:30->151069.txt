PATIALA: A man clubbed his wife to death in her sleep in the wee hours of Monday after an argument over the marriage of their son. 

 Patiala's   resident   also attacked his son, Binu (23), with a bat-like, blunt object and left the mother-son duo for the dead. Binu is under treatment at PGIMER, Chandigarh, and his condition is said to be critical. 
 
 Harcharan is on the run, but the police have said he would be arrested soon. Such was the force with which Harcharan attacked his wife,  , on her forehead that she died on the spot. Harcharan, police believe, then went on to attack Binu, who was also sleeping. Binu was first rushed to Patiala's Rajendra Hospital, and was later referred to Chandigarh. 
 
 Patiala superintendent of police (investigation) Bhupinder Singh Virk said a preliminary probe had revealed that the trio had been getting into frequent arguments over Binu's marriage. He said that Harcharan picked a blunt object on Monday, probably a cricket or baseball bat and attacked his wife and son, while both were asleep. 
 
 He said after committing the crime, the accused fled the scene. Binu worked at a mobile-repair shop, while Harcharan was a driver.
 
 A team of senior police officials reached the spot along with the forensic experts to lift vital evidence that could help the police prove the case in court. A case under sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC has been registered at Kotwali police station on a complaint filed by Paramjit Kaur, sister of Rupinder.
