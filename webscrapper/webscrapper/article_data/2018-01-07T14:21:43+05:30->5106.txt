One set of conscience keepers for the industry was good enough and now, Nandita Roy and   have some competition. Ever since the posters of the Soumitra Chatterjee-starrer Prayas made it to the walls, the director duo has been going crazy with calls. The film’s poster mentions ‘Nabanita & Shibaprasad presents’, a trend the directors started after getting into production. What led to the confusion are the similar sounding names of Nandita and   and the presence of their fave,  , in the film. Nabanita and   are a couple, who would deal in realty before getting into films. If all goes well, they want to carry their association with   forward with a string of films. They are already thinking of announcing one more film with Soumitra Chatterjee; the prayas is on.
