Vadodara: Disputes and resistance to members of minority community being sold properties in the old city areas and eastern parts of the city have been reported in the past. But for the first time, such an issue has cropped up in the western parts of the city.

 Residents of some societies on the   have objected to projects directed towards the minority community coming up in the area. Two such apartment projects have been announced in the area triggering demonstrations by residents on Saturday in front of one of the proposed sites. 
 
 The boards announcing two projects had come up on the Sun Pharma Road recently. Boards for both the projects have the same contact number, but the name of the developer has not been mentioned on them.
 
 Mehul Dixit, a resident of   in the area who was involved with the protests, said that the area had 100 to 150 societies where Hindus stayed and the two projects for Muslims were coming up in their midst. “We will be making representations regarding the issue to the municipal commissioner, mayor and district collector,” he said.
 
 Dixit pointed out that the reason for opposing the projects was that the local residents were uncomfortable. “There were major differences in the lifestyle of the two communities. We do not want to be aggressive on the issue. We want a solution only within the law,” he said.
 
 Municipal commissioner Dr   said that only the district collector could look into the matter keeping in mind the Disturbed Area Act. The local residents, however, had no clarity in this regard. Attempts to reach the two phone numbers mentioned on the boards for the site were not successful.
