Actor   recently did a hand-walk in his show  . When asked why he chose to do this unusual but cool acrobat,   replied, “In the show, there is a sequence where my character   is working out bare body and one of the girls in the heroine’s family is drooling over him. Since doing weight training on screen is a common thing, I thought, ‘Let’s do something new’. And, since I have a martial arts background, I thought the audience would like this change.”
 
  During a chat, the actor also revealed that he has been practicing martial arts and gymnastics since eight years. Talking about being an athlete, he said, “I started gym training in my 12th standard back home in  . I was also a district level swimmer, apart from being active in nearly all major sports. In fact, my family deals in sporting goods in  . Also, I’m a pro at   and I practice it to keep myself fit and agile.”
  
  The actor also revealed that he has been getting quite a positive response for his role as Madhav in Meri Durga. He said, “I am glad I took up this opportunity because the feedback has been amazing about both my performance and my looks. My friends, fans and family have all been really supportive and kind with their compliments.”
  
  On a parting note, Adhvik adds, “Doing a STAR TV show is a different high in life for me altogether for which i am really thankful to the channel and our producer Mr   whose creative skills and experience reflect very well in this show. Meri Durga is not only based on a very beautiful, socially relevant topic but it also a commercial entertainer which is hitting the right chords with the audience.”
