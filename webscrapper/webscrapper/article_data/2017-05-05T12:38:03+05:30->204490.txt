  by civil aviation secretary RN Choubey. It is the result of a demand from all Indian airlines for guidelines to build a 'no-fly list', after Maharashtra   legislator   thoroughly beat up an   employee in March. He was subsequently barred from flying by all domestic airlines.
 
 "We have put instances of unruly behaviour into 3 categories. Level 1 will be disruptive behaviour like physical gestures, etc. Level 2 will be physically abusive behaviour, like pushing, kicking, sexual harassment, etc. Level 3 is life-threatening behaviour," said Choubey outlining the draft rules for the 'no-fly list'.
 
 The government did not specify who what constitutes unruly behaviour or who will decide on the levels of unruly behaviour.
 
 For Level 1 disruptive behaviour, passengers can be barred from flying for three months. The penalty for Level 2 behaviour, which is physically abusive behaviour, is a ban on flying for six months. 
 
 "The punishment of suspension for unruly behaviour applies to domestic carriers. If international carriers want this input, they can use it," Choubey said. 
 
 He further said airlines can ban a passenger from flying immediately after an offence, but the passenger won't come on the national no-fly list immediately.
