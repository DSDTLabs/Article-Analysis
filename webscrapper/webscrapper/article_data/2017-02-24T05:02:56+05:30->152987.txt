AHMEDABAD: The   on Thursday ordered the state government to immediately release seven persons accused in the con call centre scam. The 10 accused were detained by the administration under provisions of Prevention of Anti-social Activities Act ( ) after they had got bail from courts on FIRs lodged with the   police.

 While ordering the release of seven accused persons who were detained on February 1, Justice SH   observed: “Undisputedly, the offence committed or abetted under the provisions of the Information Technology Act is not covered under the definition of Section 2(c) of PASA.” Earlier, the high court had pulled up the state government for invoking PASA in a case of IT Act, and ordered the release of three of the accused.
 
 Mentioning that the petitioners are accused of hatching a conspiracy to cheat large a number of citizens of the US, the high court said that government advocates had failed to show how the petitioners’ activities affect the law and order situation in Gujarat.
 
 The high court further said that the legal machinery has already been moved against the accused persons and courts concerned have released them on bail. It is not proper that the administration acts against the scope of the provisions of PASA. With the release order, the HC has kept the quashing petitions pending and said that their detention term will be subject to the final outcome of the litigation.
