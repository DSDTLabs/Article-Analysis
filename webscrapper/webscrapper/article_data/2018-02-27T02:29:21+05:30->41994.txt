NEW DELHI: Amid the on-going sealing drive and protests surrounding it, CM   on Monday said he won't be celebrating   to extend his support to the traders. 

 The announcement, however, did not gone down well with the traders.   general secretary   said, "By not celebrating Holi, how is it going to help the traders? If the CM is serious about offering help, he should hold a special one-day assembly session and bring an ordinance to halt the drive."
 
  Sanjay Bhargava, general secretary, Chandni Chowk Vyapar Mandal, termed the announcement as " natak-baazi ". "Delhiites are ashamed to have a CM like Kejriwal, who didn't even condemn the assault on the chief secretary by his MLAs. This is nothing but shedding crocodile tears," he said. 
 
 "The sealing is on as per the SC order, which the CM cannot stop. But before elections, AAP had promised to develop markets. Kejriwal should at least do that, but has failed even there," Bhargava added. 
 
 While DDA had proposed changes in the amendment of Master Plan 2020 to provide relief for traders, no concrete solution have been offered so far. 
 
 Meanwhile, on Monday, south corporation sealed 16 properties in Vikaspuri and   against misuse of property and unauthorised construction. East corporation sealed 42 properties in Ramesh Park, Lalita Park, Preet Vihar, Madhuban and Dilshad Colony, among others.
