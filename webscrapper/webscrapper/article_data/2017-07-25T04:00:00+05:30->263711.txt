Mumbai: Index heavyweights  , Reliance and   lifted the   to a new all-time high at 32,246 points in Monday’s strong market, while the NSE’s   closed just 34 points (or 0.34%) off the 10k mark at 9,966 — also an all-time closing high. 

 The day’s buying in blue-chips came despite weak global markets, muted interest in mid- and small-cap stocks and also amid net selling by foreign funds in the domestic market. Investors’ wealth too rose to an all-time peak with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 138 lakh crore. 
 
 Robust earnings boosted demand for HDFC Bank and Reliance stocks, while the buying in ITC came on the back of reports that after the recent hike in GST rates on tobacco, the country’s largest manufacturer in the sector had hiked prices of most of its products. The strong buying sentiment in large-cap stocks also came after IMF said that the Indian economy was slotted to grow at over 7% during the current year. 
 
 The day’s positive trend has, however, made some people cautious. End of the session data showed that on the BSE, 1,413 stocks ended lower compared to 1,303 that ended higher. Also, on a day that the sensex rallied 217 points (0.7%), foreign investors were net sellers at Rs 367 crore. However, this selling was more than compensated by a Rs 669-crore net buying by domestic institutions,   data showed.
 
 With the expiration of derivatives contracts for the current month slotted for Thursday, market players expect trading to be volatile with an upward bias.
