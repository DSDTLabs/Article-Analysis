  : In a petition filed by the state   seeking clarification with regards to proceeding with the June 11 panchayat polls in certain wards of few village panchayats, the high court of Bombay at Goa, on Friday, said that it hasn't issued any direction to the election commission regarding the election programme in those wards. 

 The election commission wanted clarifications as the high court, on wednesday, had stayed notifications issued by government for delimitation and   in some panchayats.
 
 "While deciding on the petitions of each of the original petitioners (aspiring candidates), no directions have been issued in so far as the applicant, election commission, is concerned, qua the election programme. No separate direction is required in the matter," justice Nutan D Sardessai observed.
 
 The high court passed the stay order when the filing of nomination was under way. The deadline for filing of nominations ended on Thursday. Sources said the election machinery was considering whether they have to grant more time to new eligible candidates to file nomination papers in those wards.
