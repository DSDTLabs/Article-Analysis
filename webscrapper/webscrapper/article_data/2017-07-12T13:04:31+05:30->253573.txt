LUCKNOW: Contraceptive created by city-based   (CDRI) will get national launch when it is made available in   on   on Tuesday. 

 Earlier known as Saheli, the oral contraceptive has been renamed   and is a non-hormonal (no effect on hormonal milieu of the body) pill that will now be freely available in all government hospitals. 
 
 Another contraceptive, an injectable variant   will also be launched the same day by state minister for women, child and family welfare, Rita Bahuguna Joshi at Veerangana Avanti Bai hospital.
 
 The two   launched by the government sector will give women additional options, especially during their postpartum period and in the lactation stage. 
 
 Organising a programme for the launch at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) that will be held later in the day, Dr Vinita Das, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department said, “There was huge demand for contraceptives in these two stages when women are highly vulnerable but can also be counselled. The rate of institutional deliveries and contraceptive acceptance has increased and the government has also changed its policy from permanent contraception to giving ideal space between children.”
 
 Informing about the benefits of Antara and Chhaya, Das said, “Antara is a three-monthly injectable, safe and highly effective way for contraception in lactating mothers and fertility returns within six to eight months of stopping the injection. Chhaya, on the other hand, is the only non-hormonal contraceptive, to be taken initially twice weekly for three months and then once a week till contraception is desired and it can be stopped whenever a woman wants to conceive.”
