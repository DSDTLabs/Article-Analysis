HYDERABAD: The presence of two chief ministers in Hyderabad and their simultaneous outings turned into a commuters’ nightmare on Friday. While   and K Chandrasekhar Rao crisscrossed the city in their cavalcades, those at the receiving end was just not the common man, but even Hyderabad traffic DCP A V Ranganath.

 While the Telangana chief minister was busy attending marriage ceremonies across the city since morning, his counterpart from AP, Chandrababu Naidu, touched down at Begumpet airport at 12.55 pm.
 
 From there, he proceeded to Park Hyatt Hotel and from there went to see ailing media baron Ramaoji Rao at the residence of his son, Kiran, at Chikkoti Gardens in Begumpet. He also visited former Union Minister   who is recuperating at   and attended a programme in   before finally going to Novotel Hotel in Madhapur at 7.30 pm.
 
 In the meantime, KCR had since morning attended two marriage ceremonies at Kompally. In the evening, he joined Naidu in attending NTR scion Nandamuri Ramakrishna’s son's wedding at Novotel. As a result, commuters hit a gridlock at several places on multiple occasions since protocol demands that normal traffic should be halted when CMs move. “As per protocol, CMs have to be given the green channel. On Friday, both chief ministers were active in the city and we had to regulate traffic and stop it strategically where ever required,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) L S Chowhan told TOI.
 
 In fact, traffic DCP Ranganath was himself stuck in traffic at Banjara Hills in the evening due to Naidu’s movement. Many commuters complained the wait for VIP convoy to pass through was as much as 20 minutes. Rajan, a travelling executive, got stuck on three occasions due to the two CM’s movement.
