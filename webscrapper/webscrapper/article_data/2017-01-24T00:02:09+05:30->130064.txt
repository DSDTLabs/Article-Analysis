Kochi: Senior Congress leader   on Monday came down heavily on Kerala’s aided and self-financing education sectors, saying such institutions have become centres of corruption in the state.

 The former chief minister also urged the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau to start its anti-corruption campaign from the campuses of such educational institutions.
 
 “Education sector... whether it is aided or self-financing... these sectors have become centres of big corruption... Vigilance should start its anti-corruption drive from campuses of such institutions,” Antony said.
 
 He was delivering the A C Jose memorial lecture, organised by Ernakulam district Congress committee here.
 
 He alleged that managements of some educational institutions are engaged in “snatching” (money from students).
 
 “Educational institutions have become centre of business activities,” he said.
 
 Antony said lack of student politics on the campuses is one of the major reasons for corrupt practices on the campuses. He urged KSU and Youth Congress activists to launch strong protests against “existing corrupt practices” in the state’s aided and self-financing education sectors. agencies
