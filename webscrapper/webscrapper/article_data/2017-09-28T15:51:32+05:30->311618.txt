CHENNAI: The anti-land grabbing wing of the   district crime branch on Wednesday arrested a 25-year-old man for allegedly   a realtor in Chennai. 

 Police nabbed Jebaraj of Sogandi near Sunguvarchathiram for allegedly cheating real estate businessman P Ranjankumar, 40, of Thousand Lights in Chennai. Jebaraj’s father Gnanaraj and mother Jebarani, who also named in the FIR, were absconding, police said.
 
 Gnanaraj had received Rsv4.11 crore from Ranjankumar after giving him power of attorney to sell his property measuring 13 acres and 80 cents at Sogandi in 2014. As the land prices went up, Gnanaraj refused to register the property in Ranjankumar’s name. Later, he cancelled the power of attorney given to Ranjankumar.
 
 When Ranjankumar came to know about this, he sought Gnanaraj to either return the money or register the property in his name. However, Gnanaraj refused to do so. Subsequently, Ranjankumar lodged a complaint with north zone inspector-general of police C Sridhar. The petition was referred to the Kancheepuram district superintendent of police Santhosh Haidmeni. 
 
 The police conducted a probe and confirmed that Ranjankumar’s complaint was true.
 
 The police were searching for Jebaraj’s parents.
