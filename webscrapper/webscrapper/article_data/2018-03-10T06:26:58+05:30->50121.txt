AHMEDABAD: Medical experts voiced concern and consent in equal measure as the   on Friday allowed passive   and living wills, saying that the right to die with dignity was a fundamental right.

 Leading neurologist Dr   that euthanasia is not purely a legal issue and has many dimensions.
 
 “Life is the most precious thing on earth and I believe that while it is good that the law has allowed passive euthanesia, implementing it will be a complex issue. The law would need guidelines at the micro-level and lay down all minute details with all conditions,” said  , who deals with patients with complex neurological diseases who become bedridden and many end up in a vegetative state as well.
 
 “In deciding on issues of life and death, one also has to factor in that there could be an error in medical diagnosis, social biases and religious sentiments as well. 
 
 Dr M M Prabhakar, superintendent of  , said passive euthanasia is an alien term for Indians who do not believe in giving up hope even at the last moment. “In rarest of the rare cases, relatives of patients suffering from deadly diseases like advance-stage cancer, inquire about passive euthanasia but they too first try find medical ways so that their kin can live healthily again,” said Prabhakar. Dr Prabhakar conceded that there was the possbility of the law being misused by people with vested interests. 
 
 Dr Pankaj Shah, professor and HOD of nephrology and transplant medicine at   (IKDRC), said that he has come across many persons whose relatives are languishing for life in want of vital organs. “We had to convince them that euthanasia is not legally possible in the country but the verdict may give a new hope to such persons who have been suffering with the mental and financial burden due to terminal disease of their kin,” said Shah.
