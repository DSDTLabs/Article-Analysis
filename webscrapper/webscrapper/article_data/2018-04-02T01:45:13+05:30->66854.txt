NEW DELHI:   and   of several   in Delhi, including   and  , are set to observe a token strike on Monday over some of their demands regarding the National Medical Commission Bill not being accepted by the government.

 The stir, called by the Indian Medical Association, will be held for two hours from noon to 2pm. Healthcare services at multiple hospitals are likely to be affected briefly, said IMA.
 
 Besides, protests will be held across India and a large number of doctors and medical students are set to hold rallies in many districts. The Bill still remains “anti-poor, anti-federal, anti-democratic and lacks national character”, IMA alleged.
 
 “Although, the cabinet-approved draft of NMC Bill has marginally increased the state representation and control of the government over 50% of the fee levied, IMA feels that these are cosmetic in nature and the Bill still remains anti-poor, anti-federal, non-representative and undemocratic,” said RN Tandon, secretary general of IMA.
 
 Tandon expressed concern at the unaddressed issues such as token presence of elected members, sub-optimal representation to state governments and health universities and the lack of autonomy of the National Medical Commission itself.
 
 The Union cabinet, on March 28, approved amendments to the NMC Bill, including removing the contentious provision of “bridge course”, which would have allowed practitioners of alternative medicines to pursue allopathy.
 
 The Union cabinet chaired by prime minister Narendra Modi also approved that the final MBBS examination would be held as a common examination throughout the country, and would serve as an exit test, to be called the National Exit Test (NEXT).
