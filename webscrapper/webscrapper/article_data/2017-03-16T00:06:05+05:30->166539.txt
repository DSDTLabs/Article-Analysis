New Delhi: Nine JNU students, who opposed Delhi Police’s plea for a polygraph test in missing   Ahmed case, on Wednesday said that there is no law that allows a magistrate court to either direct or to record consent or refusal for conducting a lie-detector test. A court has   its   in the case for March 20.

 The court was hearing Delhi Police’s plea seeking to record consent or refusal of the students for conducting a lie-detector test.
 
 Appearing for the students before the chief metropolitan magistrate Sumit Dass, advocate Vishwa Bhushan Arya said that the Delhi police’s plea was “highly unwarranted and illegal”. 
 
 Arya cited the guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission, which state that a polygraph test is not authorised by law, it must perforce be regarded as illegal and unconstitutional unless it is voluntarily undertaken under non-coercive circumstance. 
 
 The Delhi high court in December 2016 had directed the police to conduct tests on Ahmed’s roommate and nine suspects to find clues about his disappearance. It, however, made it clear that the police will only subject the suspects to the test after getting their consent.
 
 HC in February this year said it was neither monitoring the probe to trace Ahmed nor had it ordered a lie-detector test on any suspects. It was the domain of the police to decide the manner in which investigation has to be carried out, after one of the students sought recall of the HC’s December 14 and December 22, 2016 orders.
 
 The court had then said, “If the student does not want to undergo the test, he can refuse it.”
