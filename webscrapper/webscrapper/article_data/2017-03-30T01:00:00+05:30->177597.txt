South actress Raai Laxmi is all set to make her   debut in Deepak Shivdasani’s '  2', produced and directed by him. With the film’s release date to be announced soon, BT caught up with her for a quick chat. Excerpts…

 
 
 I couldn’t have asked for a better film than this for this landmark in my career. However, I’d never planned my Bollywood debut. I was looking at women-centric scripts down South, when this offer came my way through common connections. I was aware that the first part had a lot of skin show, and insisted on this film being different. And, it is indeed different. 'Julie 2' may have a lot of skin show, but it also has a hard-hitting, relatable story.
 
 
 The film revolves around the nepotism in the industry, which was recently talked about. I play a small-town girl, who faces many difficulties before achieving success as an actress. 
 
 
 
 This film has a beautiful story. I was offered a lot of films in Bollywood, but this one stole my heart. Also, Deepakji is a brilliant director to work with.
