UDHAGAMANDALAM: T T V  , the newly elected RK Nagar legislator, on Wednesday said his group would soon approach the   for permission to continue to use ‘AIADMKAmma’ as its party name.

 “If the situation demands, we will start a new political party to regain the tag ‘AIADMK’ and two leaves symbol,” Dhinakaran told reporters here.
 
 “We will contest the local body elections as well as the   election and definitely see victory in both. And all MLAs in the present government will join us,” said Dhinakaran.
 
 Asked how it would be possible to retrieve the party name and the symbol by winning the elections, Dhinakaran said, “That is the point. Once we win the election, all MLAs will join us. Then it’s just a question of regaining the party and the symbol. Now the MLAs are with EPS and OPS only for power.”
 
 “The   is behind the present government in   and is the sole reason for all the confusion in the state,” he said.
 
 Asked whether he would consider an alliance with the DMK, Dhinakaran said, “The DMK was the main rival of Amma and MGR. There is no way we would ally with the DMK in any given situation.”
 
 DMK working president M K Stalin lacked popularity with the masses to emerge as a strong leader and hence there was no chance for the DMK in the coming elections, be it for the local body in the state or for the Lok Sabha next year, he said. Later, Dhinakaran garlanded the statue of MGR at Dannington Bridge in Kotagiri on his 101st birth anniversary.
