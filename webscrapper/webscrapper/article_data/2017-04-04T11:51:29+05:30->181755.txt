After featuring in Stephen Frears's Brit period drama, 'Victoria and Abdul', in which he plays Abdul Karim, an Indian clerk who forges an unlikely friendship with Judi Dench's Queen Victoria,   is making concerted efforts to foray into Hollywood. The 30-year-old actor has signed up with London-based talent agency, Julian Belfrage Associates, whose clientele boasts of such prolific names as three-time Academy Award-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis, BAFTA winner Jude Law and Judi, among others.
Ali is elated to be a part of the elite club. “Victoria (late Julian Belfrage's wife and Managing Director of the company) was quite taken up by the Victoria and Abdul footage. We forged a rapport during the film's shoot as she'd sometimes be on the sets with Judi. This opportunity will open new doors for me,“ Ali exults, adding that he would love to collaborate with Daniel and Jude. “I have told Victoria that part of the deal should be that I get to hang out with them,“ he laughs.
 
 Earlier last week, Ali was in Las Vegas for CinemaCon and to be a part of the period drama's trailer launch for distributors. “The feedback has been encouraging. I am in London at the moment to complete the remaining portions of the film in a two-day schedule,“ he informs.
 
 Recent reports have claimed that certain portions of Agra will be recreated in London during the last schedule after a right-wing organisation agitated on the sets last November against a statue of Queen Victoria in Mehtab Bagh, a charbagh complex in Agra. “We wanted to be careful after what happened in Agra so the schedule was moved on my suggestion,“ informs the actor who returns to Mumbai on April 13.
