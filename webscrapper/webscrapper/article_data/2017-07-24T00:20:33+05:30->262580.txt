THANE: Concerned by the 22   due to   from April 2016 to May 2017 in  , Panvel, Vashi and Bhandup-Mulund areas serviced by the   of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd ( ), authorities have issued an advisory for citizens’ safety.

 The MSEDCL has cautioned citizens to follow simple precautions such as staying away from street lights, electric poles, sub-stations and transformers and to avoid water puddles close to an electric pole.
 
 “The societies should ensure that electric wires are not kept out and hanging outside the meter box. Precaution should be taken that there is a fuse wire in their main switch which will ensure that the power supply will stop in the event of a short-circuit. As current can pass easily through water, all electric equipment and machines must be kept away from balcony or window so that rain water does not fall on it. People should do an electric supply check by a professional engineer and see to it that there is earthing system in the house so that electric shock is avoided,” said a senior officer from MSEDCL.
 
 He added that majority the incidents of electrocution occur during the monsoon. In fact, of the total 37 cases of shock due to electric current, 22 have died due to sheer negligence having come in in contact with strong power currents. Three animals that were tied around the electric poles, too, were electrocuted.
 
 Of the 22 people who died, three were MSEDCL employees, who are believed to have failed to observe basic safety measures while dealing with the power lines.
