PATNA: National Commission for Women (NCW) member   on Friday said a notice would be served on leader of opposition in state Assembly   for revealing the identity of the eight-year-old minor girl, who was allegedly raped and killed in Gaya on February 6.

 Tejashwi had made the name of the minor girl as well as her caste public on social media on Thursday. The girl’s body was recovered on February 7.
 
 Tejashwi, however, clarified on Friday that there was nothing wrong in revealing the name of a dead girl. “An attempt is being made to trap me by the ruling coalition government. I am surprised that few people in JD (U) and BJP are trying to distract the attention of people from some of the burning issues plaguing the state. The minor girl was raped and brutally burned by cigarette. Cases of gang-rapes are on the rise in the state, but CM   is keeping mum,” Tejashwi added.
 
 The former deputy CM also criticised Nitish for not visiting the family members of the Gaya girl. “The CM and Gaya district administration officials were even not aware of this heinous crime, even though we got the news despite being in the opposition. The CM, instead of visiting the family of the girl, was busy in cheap politics. Law and order is crumbling in the state with each passing day, but the CM is least bothered about it,” he said.
 
 JD (U) and BJP, on the other hand, criticised Tejashwi for “politicising” the issue. Gaya MLA and state agriculture minister Prem Kumar said one should not play caste politics on such gave issues. “Being the leader of opposition, Tejashwi has certain responsibilities and he should immediately apologise for his mistake,” he said.
 
 JD (U) spokesperson   took a dig at Tejashwi, saying that by revealing the identity of the minor girl, the former deputy CM proved that he was a “ninth pass” student.
