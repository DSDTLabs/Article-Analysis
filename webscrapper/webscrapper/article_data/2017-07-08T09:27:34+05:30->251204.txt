ITANAGAR: The   (APCC) has accused chief minister   of being dictatorial besides interfering in the functioning of his cabinet colleagues. 

 "The interference of the chief minister in the functioning of his cabinet colleagues leading to cancellation of interviews for recruitment of junior engineers in the department of urban development and rural work has literally exposed his dictatorial attitude and pinpoints the sheer lack of collective responsibility of the cabinet," Congress spokesperson Hina Camder Tok said in a statement on Friday.
 
 "Without considering the cumbersome exercise undertaken for conducting interview by the respective departments and the inconvenience caused to candidates appearing for the examination, the APCC feels the exercise of the government is immature," said Tok. If the credibility of the department to conduct the examination is doubtful, why did the government advertise for the vacant posts and dispatched call letters to candidates for appearing in the examination, the party asked.
 
 The APCC, while casting aspersions on the role of the government, has demanded clarification as to what made them cancel the interview hastily. "The government should know that thousands of unemployed engineers are crossing the prescribed age limit owing to dilly-delaying tactics of the BJP government," the party added.
