NEW DELHI: Nearly a third of all   flyers to and from India last year came from or went to the United Arab Emirates ( ). Not surprisingly, Dubai-Mumbai was the busiest international air route for India in 2017 with 24.3 lakh people flying between the two mega cities. Delhi-Dubai was a close second at 20.7 lakh, according to DGCA data for foreign air travel in 2017.

 Of the 1.9 crore people who flew between India and UAE last year, a significant number was transiting on the mega carriers of the region — Emirates and Etihad. While this percentage is not shown by DGCA data, up to 30% of these   are estimated to travel between India and the rest of the world through the hubs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
 
 Dubai Tourism recently said India had emerged as the “number one source market for Dubai’s in-bound tourism”; the glitzy emirate saw 14 lakh tourists between January and September 2017. Abu Dhabi Tourism said “India is the second largest international source market with more than 3.6 lakh guests” in 2017, an increase of 11% over the previous year.
 
 Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority chairman Khalid Jasim Al Midfa recently said India is “undisputedly one of the largest key markets for the tourism and travel industry around the world. In fact, 1.38 lakh Indian guests stayed in Sharjah hotel establishments during 2017”.
 
 Almost a third of all international travel to and from India takes place on Gulf carriers. Given the domination of Gulf carriers over international trade to and from India, the Modi government has not enhanced flying rights to hubs there despite demand from airlines there. As a result, the growth in 2017 over 2016 is mainly by planes of Indian and Gulf carriers flying fuller.
 
 The other big magnets included Singapore, Oman, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UK and Malaysia.
