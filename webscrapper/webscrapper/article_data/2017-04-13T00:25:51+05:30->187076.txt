Pune: The Pune Cantonment Board ( ) has decided that, in employment, compassionate ground will be given top priority rather than incapacity or allied medical reasons.

 The issue came up at a recent board meeting at which multiple claims of employment on compassionate grounds to the kin of a deceased or medically unfit employee were being discussed. Cases of employment claims also came up where the employee has been missing for over a decade and there has been no information about their whereabouts. No death certificate has been produced before the board either.
 
 Between April 2014 and December 2016, the PCB has reported 71 vacancies across departments. The vacancies have come up due to a variety of reasons, including retirement, employee being declared medically unfit, or the death of an employee. According to central employment rules, at any given point of the year, five per cent vacancies need to be filled by one of the family members of the deceased or medically unfit employee.
 
 Officials said that granting compassionate employment can be tricky, since employees often voluntarily seek retirement on medical grounds. “Over the years, a few employees have approached authorities requesting to be declared medically unfit, so that one of their family members gets his or her job on compassionate grounds but these cases are often difficult to judge, whether the case of medical incapacity is justified,” said a senior PCB official.
 
 The PCB has pointed out that in future cases of compassionate employment, a situation wherein the employee has passed away will be prioritised over all else.
 
 “When an employee dies, the family is often left with nothing to fend for. So, we have decided to prioritise cases of death of an employee and any vacancy will be offered to their kin first. We will follow all central personnel rules while deciding on the vacancy, such as the number of dependents of the employee who expired, among others,” the official added.
