 “Currently, Khan is being interrogated by UP ATS and nothing of Rajasthan specific has come to our notice. But there are several important pieces of information which, we think, should be verified,” the official said.

We have read about Khan’s alleged ties in Rajasthan, but nothing has been communicated officially to us by our counterparts there, hence, we are waiting to interrogate him,” the official said.
