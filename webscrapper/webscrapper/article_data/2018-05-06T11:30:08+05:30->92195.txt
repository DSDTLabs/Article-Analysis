CHANDIGARH: Taking a little longer than others to reach the stage, the audience showered   with a thunderous applause until he received his award for his research paper at the convocation ceremony of engineering graduates held here on Saturday. 

 Quick to climb the ladder of life, Ahuja, 33, is a research scholar at the Dr SSBUICET, Chandigarh, and has published five papers in international journals so far, besides three books. One of his papers is under the process of publishing.
 
 Afflicted with polio in both his legs,   says that challenges are numerous but one must not lose hope. "My lab is at the first floor and there is no ramp or lift in my department. Reaching the lab is a little problematic, but now I have learnt to manage. A student with physical disabilities can do everything except he takes more time than the others," said Ahuja. After completing his MTech from PU, he worked for three years and then enrolled himself at the university for PhD.
