NEW DELHI: United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson  , who had come here along with her daughter   Gandhi Vadra, was rushed to Delhi on Thursday night after she complained of having difficulty breathing and high blood pressure. 

 
 She was taken to Chandigarh by road and airlifted to Delhi from there. Gandhi had come here to inspect Priyanka’s under-construction house at Chharabra, around 15 km from here. Last year too, she had to cut short her visit and was later admitted to a Delhi hospital. 
 
 Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) Hospital senior medical superintendent Dr   said he received a call around 11pm that Gandhi was not well. Though the hospital administration requested Gandhi’s staff to bring her to the medical college, they preferred to take her to Delhi. A medical team accompanied her to Chandigarh in her car. 
 
 From Chandigarh, she was airlifted to Delhi on a chartered flight
