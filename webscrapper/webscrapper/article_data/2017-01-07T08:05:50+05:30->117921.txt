SHIMLA: Having outlived their utility, British-era pipelines in Shimla have started posing danger to residents. As these   on a daily basis, there is every possibility of a major accident if these pipes burst, residents have claimed.

 Pipeline bringing water from Gumma source has developed major crack near Craignano and Baldeyan areas of Shimla leading to wastage of huge amount of water. Residents said the condition of pipeline in their area is pathetic and it can burst anytime that may prove fatal for them. At some of leaking points, residents have joined their own pipes to utilize the water going waste.
 
 According to sources in MC, around 10 MLD water gets wasted due to leakage every day in Shimla. Around six months back, the   (IPH) department handed over the water supply and distribution of city and its surroundings to the MC.
 
 Responsible to deal with all water related problems including repairing the pipelines, the SMC had claimed that all problems in the city will end by October 2016.
 
 “SMC has failed to repair the pipeline on time which has led to wastage and water shortage. At some areas of Shimla, people are not getting water for 5-6 days,” claimed BJP councillor from Benmore ward Anup Vaid.
 
 Vaid said he along with areas residents inspected the spot near Craignano on Friday and found out that old pipeline was not the only problem in the area. “SMC had repaired the joints so poorly that these can burst any time. When I narrated the situation to   and government authorities, nobody responded, which shows their lack of concern for the city,” he alleged.
 
  said pipelines definitely need to be changed as these are more than 100 years old. “SMC will spend around Rs 9.5 crore on the augmentation and replacement of Shimla’s pipelines alone. We have already approved the plan for pipelines which can take another six months to be implemented as these need to be sanctioned technically by the state government,” he added.
