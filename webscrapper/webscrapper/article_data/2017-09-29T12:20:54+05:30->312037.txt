MOHALI: The police on Thursday questioned family members of journalist   and his mother  , who were brutally killed at their residence in Phase 3B2,  , on Friday night.

 After having ruled out robbery as the motive, cops are working on a number of angles, including property dispute, but have found no success so far. Police officers said the footages of   cameras have also not been of much help as it was raining heavily that night and most of the images were blurry.
 
 Police have also spoken to some former colleagues of KJ Singh to get an insight into the case. Mohali SSP   said, “We can’t say much at this stage of investigation. We are questioning people. We have many positive leads, but cannot reveal anything prematurely.”
