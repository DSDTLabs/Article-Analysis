BENGALURU: The   high command's nudge to CM   to contest from   in Bagalkot district, apart from his choice Chamundeshwari, could pose some hurdles for him.

 
 While many believe Siddaramaiah will have a cakewalk, since Badami has Kurubas, OBCs and Muslims in majority, some say the   issue could dent his prospects. They point to Shivayoga Mandira near Mahakoota, a pilgrimage site and a centre which trains individuals to be pontiffs and seers of Veerashaiva mutts across South India. "The mandir's word is law across over 35 villages in Badami constituency and people from all castes and creed revere Sri Sanganabasava Mahaswamy, president of the Shivayoga Mandira," they add.
 
 "We're not saying the swamiji will ask his devotees to vote against Siddaramaiah. But given the stand of Veerashaiva seers on the   issue, there's a feeling it may influence voters," said a senior Congress leader.
 
 JD(S) candidate Hanumanthappa Mavinamarad said, "The result will depend on the mandir. Veerashaivas are hugely upset with Congress and this makes Siddaramaiah's prospects difficult."
 
 BJP has been opposing the government on the Lingayat issue and it may use the mandir's influence against Congress.
 
 However, another Congress leader said though Veerashaivas are against Congress, to say they'd influence other communities is incorrect.
