IMPHAL: 
 

 This is a verdict against the corrupt rule of Congress. People have voted for change. Prime Minister Narendra Modiji's campaign created a BJP wave in Manipur and we succeeded in taking his message to voters. The Congress used  , but people were angry with non-governance, fake encounters and rising corruption.
 
  
 
 
 We are confident of forming the next government in Manipur. The National People's Party has won four seats and   has won one. They will join us as they are already partners of the NDA government at the Centre. We will also approach the winning Independent and Trinamool candidates.
 
  But you will still fall short of the majority mark of 31. What about roping in the support of Naga People's Front? 
 
 The Naga People's Front has bagged four seats and has been campaigning for a non-Congress government in Manipur. If it wants to provide outside support, we won't turn it down. The party also supports the NDA.
 
 
 
 That will be decided by BJP's central leadership.
 
  Contrary to expectations, BJP did well in the Imphal valley but took a beating in the Naga areas. 
 
 We won five seats in the hills, including one in a Naga-dominated area. We would have done better had militants not created hurdles for our campaign. They harassed many BJP workers. In the valley, we did well because people were fed up with 15 years of Congress rule. This election proves that the era of Congress dominance in Manipur is over. The BJP is now the new alternative.
