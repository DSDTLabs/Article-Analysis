 According to Hidco officials, the application is currently being tested and once it’s done, it will be rolled out with necessary modifications.
 
 “Based on the feedback of KYR, Hidco authorities will take up urgent repair work on damaged spots of the roads or whether urgent traffic diversions are required. The main aim is to introduce this application to ensure a hassle free ride for motorists who will ply on New Town roads to reach their destination,” said a Hidco official.
