AHMEDABAD: The District Primary Education Officer (DPEO) on Friday imposed a fine of Rs1.10 lakh on two schools in the city —   (AIS) and Gems Genesis International School — over violating affiliation norms of the  . 

  The schools reportedly asked the students of class 1 to 8 to refer to books of private publications, apart from the textbooks of Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB). Last week, a Memnagar-based school had also been fined the same amount for violating the norms.
 
 The state education department officials were not satisfied with the responses provided by the school authorities. Bodakdev-based AIS is affiliated to the state education board for class 1-8 while Vaishnodevi-based Gems Genesis International School had received approval of state board’s affiliation for class 1-5.
 
 DPEO   said, “We have given the schools five days to pay the penalty amount, failing which their affiliations would be cancelled.”
 
 Sources in the state education board said that one of the conditions for affiliation is teaching the syllabus prescribed by   (GSTBB).
 
 To ensure that the students don’t suffer owing to a sudden change in the syllabus, the state education board officials have asked the school authorities to complete the ongoing term with the existing syllabus. From the next academic year, the schools will have to compulsorily follow state board syllabus.
