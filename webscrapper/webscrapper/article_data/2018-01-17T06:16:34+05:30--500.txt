 Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has asked all state police units to send details of people booked and arrested for indulging in cyber pornography involving children, cyber stalking and cyber bullying. However, awareness about such crimes is lacking among police personnel. Although   has implemented the Pocso Act, it does not segregate cases under the heads   has asked for leading to insufficient data.

 TOI spoke to police personnel from around the state and found that they were unaware about the separate heads available to register these cases.   (SCRB) officials have invited police personnel from various districts to train them to register cases under these heads. SCRB officials have also forwarded the particulars they had received from NCRB to fill in the details every month and update them.
 
 “When Pocso Act was enacted, only a few states like Tamil Nadu implemented
 
 it effectively. Now, every state is booking people under Pocso Act. But there should be proper interim training for all the police personnel (to ensure that the data is foolproof),” said social activist and Madras high court lawyer  .
 
 “Initially, sub-inspectors and officers ranked above can be trained as they are designated to register cases in the state,” he said.
 
 While police registering Pocso cases are unaware of the finer aspects, parents and schools who come across such cases often hush them up. Most cases involving children, like revenge porn and sexting, were ‘settled’ at schools and many parents were reluctant to file complaints, police said. Sources said in some cases, schools could not take serious action as it involved many students. Preethi Manohar, counsellor at  , said the schools were right in not making the cases public.
 
 “Like the ‘blue whale’ phenomenon, such things can spread. Parents and teachers should do well by talking to the children rather than spreading panic,” she said.
