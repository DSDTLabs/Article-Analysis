VIJAYAWADA: It has been exactly six months since the ‘  City Police   Warden Organisation’ initiative was launched by city police and it has garnered a positive response. It has also solved the problem of staff shortage in the wing.

 Sporting a blue vest and a cap, designed and provided by the city police for volunteers, the latter helps manage traffic at 20 junctions, including MG Road, Eluru Road and Benz Circle. The volunteers also participate in awareness campaigns and counselling sessions. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, city police commissioner   stated that the initiative helps bridge the gap between the police and the public by making it participative. “It is impressive to see traffic wardens create an impact in their own limited manner. It provides a healthy interface between the police and the public,” Sawang told TOI. Police sources pointed out that volunteers come from various walks of life, including students and rich businessmen. So far, cops have trained 100 volunteers — men and women including senior citizens and youngsters. 
 
 “By participating in such initiatives, people see traffic from a fresh perspective, which, in turn, helps them to accrue more knowledge. They will then inspire others and in the process create awareness among the public about the need for traffic discipline,” Sawang added.
 
 Anyone above the age of 18 years, with an untainted civic record, can apply for the initiative by approaching the police through VolunteerMark mobile application or log into www.vijayawadatrafficwardens.com website or even go the traffic police office opposite IGMC stadium. Some notable personalities in Vijayawada have also offered to volunteer, such as Efftronics Pvt Ltd MD D Rama Krishna, Margam Foundation head A Lakshmi, academic Ch  , industrialist M Murali Krishna, GVV projects MD V Rangaprasad, and others.
