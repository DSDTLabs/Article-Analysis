MANGALURU: When he is at work, he flies aircrafts and when he lands at his native village, he doubles up as ‘Daiva Patri’, an impersonator of demi-god, to enrich his spiritual side.

 Meet 29-year-old Manoj Salian, resident of Kinnigoli, who works as a   in Tanzania and turns as Daiva Patri. He plays a vital role during the Bhootaradane (spirit worship) of the Kanthabare Boodabare Garadi Gudde Jumadi Daivasthana in Shimanthoor near Kinnigoli, 30kms from Mangaluru.
 
 On the day of Bhoota Kola, with the fall of dusk Manoj readies himself in a traditional attire to take on the role of Daiva patri. After being possessed by demi-gods, he becomes a medium for the people to talk to the Gods. “I am doing this to preserve the rich heritage of Tulunadu. For me, flying and Daiva Patri are two different passions. I never linked my profession with religious traditions,” Manoj told TOI.
 
 Manoj’s spiritual journey began in 2003 when he got himself involved in the renovation work of the Daivasthana (spirit’s abode). These Bhoota Kola celebrations are part and parcel of the coastal Karnataka and take place during a specific time of the year. “I make sure that I land up in the coast during those days and take part in the ritual without fail every year,” he adds.
 
 After completing his graduation in Vijaya College at Mulki, Manoj went to Dehradun for AME course to pursue his dream of becoming a pilot. He became a licensed pilot in 2010 and got a job at Auric Air Services Limited in East Africa.
 
 He adds that Daiva powers have helped him to conquer difficulties while soaring in the sky. The demi-gods and their powers, both exist and the one who believes in them will understand it.
