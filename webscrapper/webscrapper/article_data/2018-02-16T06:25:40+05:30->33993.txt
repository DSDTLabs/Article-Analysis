AHMEDABAD: After receiving overwhelming response to the first round of bidding under Discovered Small Field (DSF) policy, the central government will auction 60   to private firms in the second round, which also includes 5 onshore and 2   in Gujarat.

 The 60 blocks hold 195 metric million tonnes (MMT) of oil and oil equivalent gas reserves. As far as Gujarat is concerned, 5 onshore fields having 10 MMT reserves are located in Cambay basin. 
 
 Two offshore blocks (one each in Kutch and Cambay offshore basins) have reserves of around 5MMT.
 
 A total 55 small oil and gas blocks, including 12 on-land, and three shallow-water fields in Gujarat, were put on offer under Open Acreage Licensing Programme (OALP) and the government received 134 bids.
 
 “In the second round, the fields are larger in size with almost double in-place reserves,” said Atanu Chakraborty, Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas. DGH and the ministry officials also conducted a workshop in Ahmedabad to apprise prospective investors and bidders about the features of the policy and e-bidding process.
 
 The   chaired by the prime minister Narendra Modi has recently given its approval for extending the DFS policy to identified 60 discovered small fields/un-monetised discoveries and auction them to private players.
