NEW DELHI: The plan to raise the number of electric buses in 11 major cities, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Jaipur and Delhi, has hit a bump. The department of heavy industries ( ) has pruned the ambit of giving subsidy to state transport utilities for procuring electric buses, a U-turn from its announcement four months ago. 

  In December, the DHI said it would provide the subsidy to state road transport undertakings (SRTUs) for buying buses or for their operation, which are known as capital expenditure (capex) and operational expenditure (opex) models. Under opex model, the maintenance and operation is the responsibility of operators. The opex model has been shelved. 
 
  Sources said big SRTUs such as BMTC in Bengaluru and BEST in Mumbai are staring at a crisis since most of the electric buses they ordered fall under the opex model, which DHI has abandoned. TOI has learned DHI communicated this to SRTUs early this week. "We have requested the department to reconsider the decision since we have already ordered procurement. The Centre was aware of the process and had approved," said an   chief, who did not wish to be named. 
 
  BEST general manager   said, "It may not be the end of the road. Our talks are on, and the subsidy may arrive for procuring the new electric buses." The BEST has a freeze on purchase of any new bus for Mumbai, and anything that will add to its fleet will be on the opex model only. In capex model, the SRTUs buy buses and Centre shares 60% of the total cost. The rest of the amount comes from SRTUs. 
 
  In Mumbai, 80 buses are being procured on opex with central subsidy. Similarly, Bengaluru has gone ahead with procurement of 150 buses under opex. The Centre had agreed to subsidise 80 buses.
