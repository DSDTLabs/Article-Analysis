Vijayawada: Low-cost carrier   will launch services from   from March 2, beginning with five  , a senior company executive said on Wednesday.

 Addressing the media here, Sanjay Kumar, chief commercial officer of IndiGo, said the airline will operate three daily flights between Vijayawada and Hyderabad, and one flight each to Bengaluru and Chennai. All flights will be non-stop.
 
 Kumar said IndiGo will be use its newly acquired ATR planes, with a seating capacity of 74, for the Vijayawada sector. 
 
 With the scheduled launch of services from Vijayawada, Kumar said, the airline will be operating from four places in Andhra Pradesh, the other three being Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Rajahmundry.
 
 Asked when would IndiGo launch direct flights from Vijayawada to New Delhi and Mumbai, Kumar said the airline will take a decision based on the demand from the market.
 
 Kumar said IndiGo has the license to operate from 20 stations in India under the ‘Udaan’ scheme of the central government. The airline currently operates flights between Tirupati and Kolhapur in Maharashtra, and Tirupati and Kannur in Kerala.
 
 He said that IndiGo currently serves 49 destinations, with Vijayawada set to be the 50th. IndiGo operates 1,050 flights a day with its 153 planes, he said.
 
 Kumar said one reason why IndiGo is expanding in Andhra Pradesh is because of the tax break offered by the state government on aviation turbine fuel (ATF). The tariff on ATF is at 1%, which has encouraged the airline to fly to four major towns in the state, he said.
