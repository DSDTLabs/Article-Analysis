RAJKOT:   once again lashed out at   strongman   and accused him of trying to create a rift between Leuva and Kadva Patels.

 “We are here to unite both Leuvas and Kadvas. Radadia is only resorting to divisive tactics,” Hardik said, addressing a rally in Lakhtar town of Surendranagar on Friday. 
 
 Earlier, Radadia‘s comment that Hardik had nothing to do with Leuvas had sparked outrage among the latter’s supporters. 
 
 “We will fight till the end for getting reservation and it is our right to demand,’’ he said, addressing a crowd of nearly 10,000 people.
 
 After the rally, he travelled to Dhoraji town of Rajkot to attend a marriage function.
