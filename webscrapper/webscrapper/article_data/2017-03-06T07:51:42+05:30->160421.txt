BENGALURU: Ahead of state budget on March 15, chief minister   has convened a meeting of the   at 10.30am on Monday. The purpose is to seek suggestions from ministers about their respective departments and take stock of the progress they made in the   announced for 2016-2017. 

 "Ministers will have to furnish information on whether the funds allocated to their departments were spent, and provide reasons for some programmes not taking off," said sources. 
 
  Although Siddaramaiah has been holding consultations with individual departments along with the ministers, sources said, Monday's meeting will provide a platform for a brainstorming session. The   is said to be particularly focusing on this year's budget as the next one won't provide scope for the ruling outfit to announce populist programmes, given that it'll be an election year. An outgoing government usually presents a vote on account (financial approval to spend money) for four months beginning April. It's up to the new government to either continue the programmes announced or scrap them. 
 
 The meeting is also expected to discuss programmes being undertaken for drought, besides the scrapping of the proposed steel flyover. 
 
 However, home minister   won't be present at the meeting as he is attending an international conference on internal security issues from March 7 to 9.
