KANNUR: With the   quashing the ordinance introduced in 2017 to regularize the admissions to the 2016-17 MBBS batches of Anjarakandy Medical College in   and   in  , uncertainty is staring at the students.

 Now that the ball is in the court of the apex court, the general feeling is that there is no sense in continuing the agitation.
 
 The students’ grievances were so far ignored since the case is between the state government and the  , said political observer N M Pearson, whose daughter is an affected student. He said he has asked the agitating students to withdraw from the agitation.
 
 “Now that the Supreme Court has permitted them to implead in the case, the students will get a chance to present their plight before the judiciary,” he said.
 
 Many students in this college have better NEET ranking compared to the students who gained admission in other medical colleges, he said. His daughter   had 31,000th rank and students who are much below in ranking, got admitted to other colleges and are safe now.
 
 He refuted the allegation that the students did not apply online as per the procedure but said the college management failed to prove it before the authorities.
 
  M sent his daughter abroad to pursue a medical degree as her future was in uncertainty. “If the students are denied the chance to continue their course, who will compensate for the loss, including the time they spent and the capitation fees they paid?” he asked.
 
 “The debates over the issue has created an impression that our children are not eligible to pursue their MBBS, whereas students much below in ranking are safely pursuing the course elsewhere. This is sheer injustice,” said another parent.
 
 The college authorities said they had stood by the students, and their lawyers were also present in the Supreme Court, but since they were not respondents in the case directly, they could not present the argument before the apex court, said a spokesperson from the college.
