NEW DELHI: The Wrestling Federation of India’s ( ) search for foreign coaches has finally ended. Iran’s   (men’s freestyle), Russia’s Farniev Irbek Valentinovich (women’s freestyle) and Georgia’s Temo Kazarashvili (Greco-roman) have been identified to take wrestling forward.

 
 
 
 
 But the appointment of Valentinovich is certainly going to burn a big hole in the Sports Authority of India’s ( ) pocket, since it pays for coaches’ salaries. For the first time, a foreign coach (Valentinovich) in wrestling will be getting as much as $10,000 per month in salary, more than double of what the previous foreign coaches were paid.
 
 In fact, Valentinovich’s remuneration will still be way more than what Karimi and Kazarashvili would be getting paid combined. While Karimi will be getting $3,500 per month, Kazarashvili’s appointment has been made at $4,000, at par with what previous foreign coaches were getting paid.
 
 “The reason behind appointing Valentinovich at such a hefty pay package is that he transformed the Russian female wrestlers from an average group to world beaters, who cornered medal glory at the Rio Olympics. As far as Kazarashvili is concerned, he has been a world champion,” a senior WFI official told TOI.
 
 All three will be initially offered a six-month contract until the World Championships in August in Hungary. They are expected to join the team well before the CWG from April 4 to 15.
 
 “Based on their performance at the CWG and the Worlds, their contract will be accordingly extended till the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” the official said.
 
 The three Indian coaches - Jagminder Singh (men’s), Kuldeep Malik (women’s) and Kuldeep Singh (Grecoroman) - will continue to assist the foreign coaches. The posts for foreign coaches were lying vacant since the 2016 Rio Olympics.
