MUMBAI: A day after the 29-year-old pianist’s parents raised issues Bandra police must probe, at a press conference, four family members met police commissioner Dattatray Padsalgikar, seeking more clarity. Deceased   Karan Joseph’s uncle and three others urged the commissioner to probe the reason that triggered his suicide, and also to probe the murder angle. 

  (47), from whose 12th floor flat Karan leaped to death on September 9, was called for questioning along with his domestic help, Vinod, on Tuesday. “Statements of 18 persons have been recorded so far. But there is no concrete evidence pointing to anyone. The parents initially made a normal statement, there were no allegations against anyone,” said senior inspector Pandit Thakare. Police told the FSL to speed up data analysis of mobile phones of Karan and Rishi. \
