INDORE: A month after   bus accident that claimed five lives, parents of victims gathered outside the school gates on Monday morning for a condolence meeting. 

 However, when the situation turned tense, the school administration called police to pacify the situation. The major demand raised by protesting and grieving parents was to make the inquiry report of magisterial probe public.
 
 The parents accused the police of trying to protect certain persons by not releasing the inquiry report. They also expressed dissatisfaction over the slow investigation process of the case by the police. "We are waiting for the promise made by chief minister   to be fulfilled. We have lost confidence in the government and we will promote the use of NOTA in the upcoming elections,"  , one of the protesters said. 
 
 During the protest, parents also asked teachers standing on the campus to join them for the condolence meet. However, the teachers refused to be a part of the same.   from Rau, Jitu Patwari also joined the protesters and paid condolence to the four children who died in the bus accident. 
 
 The parents carried placards bearing slogans 'Justice delayed is justice denied', 'DPS school-humari bhool' (DPS school our fault) etc. The parents also sought compensation from the government for setting up an NGO to ensure safety of children during transit to schools. Family members of one of the victims also sought return of advanced fees and the caution money of the child, to be put to use for the setting up of NGO. 
 
 Another condolence meeting was organized in evening hours at Regal Square. Parents of the four children Shruti Ludhiyanvi, Harmit Kaur, Swastik Pandya and  , who died in the accident were also present in the meet. On January 5, five students of DPS were killed when their bus collided with a truck. The bus driver was also killed, while four other students were injured in the mishap at a bypass.
