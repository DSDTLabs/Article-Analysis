Nagpur: Hundreds of residents of Ganjipeth gathered in front of the Ganeshpeth police station claiming that SNDL’s employees barged into their residences and wrongly did videography.

 Residents thrashed one of the employees, but others escaped from the spot. Locals took the injured employee to the police station and reported the matter. The cops rushed him to GMCH for treatment.
 
 Talking to TOI, an SNDL spokesperson denied all the allegations and claimed that the employees were conducting raids as per the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (MERC) rules. He said it was their right to verify the facts.
 
 The spokesperson said the company has been conducting raids against illegal power consumption across the city since July 8. During the drive, they targeted a few areas where residents are fraudulently using excess electricity.
 
 Residents told TOI that apart from seizing the meter, the employees also forcibly entered their houses when women were alone and started capturing the video on their mobile phones. The women told their neighbours who pushed out the employees.
 
 Senior police inspector MK Chauhan said an offence has not been registered so far. Further probe is underway.
