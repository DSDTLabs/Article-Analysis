Salem: Slain sandalwood brigand Veerappan’s widow, Muthulakshmi, has launched a new outfit on his birth anniversary on Thursday in Salem. “The outfit would fight for protecting water and land rights of Tamils,’’ Muthulakshmi told reporters after cutting a cake to mark her late husband’s 66th birth anniversary. She named the outfit as Mann Kaakkum Veerathamilar Peramaippu (Federation of valourous Tamils to protect the land). Muthulakshmi said she would launch a struggle to ensure adequate water for agriculture and save the land from chemical fertilisers. She however ruled out political foray using the outfit. “If a need arises for contesting in elections, we will take an appropriate decision at that time,’’ she said. Voicing her concern against constructon of a dam by Karnataka at Mekadatu, she said Cauvery water was not obstructed until her husband was alive. Muthulakshmi had launched an outfit way back in 2005, a year after Veerappan was shot dead in an encounter by the special task force near Dharmapuri. The Malaivaazh Makkal Urimai Iyakkam (Movement for the Rights of the Tribal People) went inactive soon and in 2011, she sought to revive the outfit. But she was by and large lying low. Though, now, Muthulakshmi said she would tour the state to build her new outfit. TNN
