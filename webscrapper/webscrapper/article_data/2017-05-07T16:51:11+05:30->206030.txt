HYDERABAD:   mentor   on Sunday said they are not thinking much about their play-off chances and trying to focus on executing the plans properly against   here on Monday.

 "We are not thinking too much about the points table. We just want to take each game as it comes," Laxman said.
 
 "We know that our next game against Mumbai Indians is an important game. Once we execute our plans, I am sure we will get the desired results," he said.
 
 Hyderabad, currently placed fourth on the points table with 13 points, need to win its remaining two matches to completely seal their play-offs berth.
 
 SRH, the defending champion, had lost to Delhi Daredevils by six wickets at New Delhi but what hurt them most was their 12-run loss to Rising Pune Supergiants at home on Saturday. It was their first home defeat of the season.
 
 The Hyderabad team takes on Mumbai Indians in Hyderabad on Monday.
 
 Asked if the middle-order batting is a concern for the team, especially after their failure on Saturday while chasing a modest target of 149 against Pune, Laxman replied in the negative.
 
 "The batsmen have done well this season and it was a tough wicket to bat on yesterday," Laxman said during an interaction with mediapersons here.
 
 "It (batsmen getting out) happens when you are looking to chase down a total and when the asking rate is above 10 or 12 and you have to play shots at that moment. While doing that, you can get out. But, we are very confident with our batting group," Laxman said.
 
 Asked about Ashish Nehra, who left the field on Saturday apparently due to discomfort in the hamstring, he said the injury was being assessed.
 
 Replying to a query, Laxman said   and  , who have done well for SRH in the  , were included in the team due to their performance in Asia Cup and World Cup T20.
 
 "It's not which country they come from. It's the skill set which we are looking for," he said.
