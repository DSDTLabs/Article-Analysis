CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Friday ordered judicial probe into the attack on Ludhiana central jail medical officer (MO) Dr   by the inmates after he refused to provide intoxicant injections.

 A division bench headed by Justice   passed these orders while taking up a petition filed by a local NGO. The bench has also issued notice to the director general of police (prisons) and the director, health, seeking their response on the matter.
 
 The petitioning NGO had submitted before the HC that frequent use of intoxicating injections in the jail came to fore when on September 11, Dr   was attacked by some addicts. The attackers had inflicted sharp-edged injures on the medical officer after his refusal to provide intoxicating injections. It was further stated that a large number of inmates were addicted to habit-forming prescription drugs.
