BHOPAL: When chief minister   was felicitating meritorious students at his official residence on Friday for securing a place in the top ten merit list, Class X topper   Manjhi was crying at his home in Dabra. Call it a sheer coincidence or a goof-up, Dev Prakash won’t find it easy to live down the memories of the day, when he performed so well and yet forgotten. 

 Dev Prakash told TOI on phone, “I am disheartened. I was happy to see my name as a topper in the state. But, the joy washed away as I could not get the award from Mama.” He blamed the mistake on officials for not inviting him for the function. “I hope, Mama will look into the matter.” His father Kadam Singh Manjhi, a constable in MP Police, is posted at Shivpuri. 
 
 Talking to the correspondent, Ved Prakash turned emotional. “Such achievements are rare in life. I am not accusing anyone, but at least it should have been ensured that the topper is not left out,” he said. 
 
 Dev Prakash claimed information about him was available with the district education office. “I got to know about the function at the CM House from newspapers and TV channels. My family and I were keen to attend the function. But, there was no correspondence from the authorities,” the boy from Dabra said. 
 
 He, however, said such issues won’t discourage him. “I have done best and proved that students from small places can do wonders. Recognition was expected, but I can’t help it if it is not done,” said the topper, sounding somewhat dejected. 
 
 Giving credit to his teachers, he said, “Their scientific method to study helped me score well and get the position.” About studies, he said, “There was nothing like any scheduled timing for studies. Whenever I felt comfortable I did studies.” 
 
 When contacted, MPBSE chairman SR Mohanty said, “There was no issue of not inviting him for the function. It happened unintentionally.”
