NEW DELHI: Asserting that “negativity has better recall value“, Delhi chief minister  ,   ­ who is under suspension following a CBI case and has not ruled out joining a political party­ has written a blog addressed to former lieutenant governor  .

 Dipped in sarcasm, it alleges that Jung had asked him to find out about the “misconducts“ of a then vicechancellor of a Delhi government university and was not happy when he couldn't find anything.
 
 “After a few weeks of your joining the constitutional post of lieutenant governor of Delhi, you had asked me to send you the personal file of a then vicechancellor of a Delhi government university. You had specifically mentioned that you require the file containing complaints against him,“ he wrote. “In any civilised and progres sive society, intellectual differences lead to better ideas and progress. But in this instance, it led to reprisal.“
 
 Kumar said he learnt later that the VC was forced to proceed on long leave and could join back only a few days before retirement. He praised that person's track record and work.
 
 Kumar then alleged that Jung was “always concerned about me, my welfare and my education“ and had tried to rope in a CBI official to do the job but he refused. But his “education“ did happen, he claims, with many people visiting his house and office and he being summoned many times to the country's “premier educational and transformational institution“.
 
 However, he said he proved to be “stupid and stubborn“ as a student.
 
 In a cryptic manner and without giving away anything about what he was referring to, Kumar mentioned that he was admitted to another “world class correctional institution“ but could not be educated. And he remains “ignorant“ to this day, he said.
