LUCKNOW: She became eligible to cast her vote nine years ago but Dr  , currently working in the pediatrics department of King George's Medical University (KGMU) has not been able to cast her vote ever. And it is not because she doesn't have a voter ID card. "I got my card made when I was 18 but have not been able to vote as a day's leave is neither possible nor feasible for the back and forth journey home. My father was in the army and could vote through post. That facility should be for medicos too," she said. 

 A native of Azamgarh, Dr Yadav is among the close to 4,000 resident doctors and MBBS students at KGMU who have demanded an alternative option for casting their vote. The   (RDA) of KGMU has also written to the state election commission and apprised the   (ECI), Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and the Governor, about the issue through social media. 
 
 "It seems like the educated youth is being left out deliberately from the democratic process. When the economy can be cashless, why can't there be digital voting options?" asked Dr Shashank Mishra, president, RDA, KGMU. Dr Mishra, a resident of Lakhimpur, takes around 8-10 hours to reach home. "Even if we get leave, a replacement has to be provided and that would mean continuous duty of 24-48 hours for the replacement," he said. According to Mishra, around 15,000 medical professionals in the state are stuck in the situation.
