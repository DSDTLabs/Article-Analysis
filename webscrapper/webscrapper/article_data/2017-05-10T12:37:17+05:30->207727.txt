PORVORIM: While supporting the Goa Goods and Service Tax (GST) bill, 2017, Congress   gave credit to former Prime Minister   for getting GST bill. 

 During the discussion on GST bill, Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro said he support the iconic economic reform by the government of India. “In fact, in the 2006-2007 budget, this reform was introduced by the   government led by Singh and the main objective is to cut inflation and provide benefit to the common man,” he said.
 
 He also said that the reform should have been passed 10 years ago, but the then NDA, for their own political reasons, rejected it. “The reforms could have earned the state Rs 20 lakh crore,” he added
 
 Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane said that there are around 176 sections to the GST bill and “I doubt members have read it”. 
 
 He added that one clause surprises him which gives unlimited powers to any officer to enter premises and search if they suspect anything improper. 
 
 Ponda MLA   asked what would happened to entertainment tax collected from casinos once GST is implemented. Chief minister Manohar Parrikar replied that Naik is concerned about entertainment tax as Naik gave the most licences during his tenure as home minister.
