Ludhiana: Prices of certain vegetables, including broccoli, peas, and capsicum (both red and yellow) — often considered ‘healthy’ — continued to remain on the high side in the second week of May in vegetable markets across the city. Apart from coriander, cauliflower too has gone beyond the reach of middle class families, putting extensive pressure on household budgets. On the other hand, prices of the most consumed vegetables like tomato, onion, brinjal, and okra have gone down due to surplus growth of the crops in farms across northern India.

 Joginder Singh, one of the vendors in the city’s busiest vegetable market, said due to bad weather conditions across the northern parts of the country,   may increase in the coming days, but at present, the prices of most consumed vegetables are under control, and so people were satisfied with the prices. However, prices of a few other vegetables continued to remain high, as they are mostly transported from far-off places.
 
 Another vendor, Shambu Parsad, said due to lower vegetables prices of the most consumed vegetables, vendors were facing hardship dealing with their daily needs. One of the reasons behind the price increase of ‘healthy’ vegetables like broccoli, peas, and capsicum was due to the fact that they are mostly grown in cold places, so as winter ends, the prices shoot up.
 
 Meanwhile, residents — especially women — who have to run their kitchens were not much upset, as the prices of most vegetables were not very high these days. Dilpreet Kaur stated: “Green vegetables are still far from the reach of middle class families, as the central government has no policy to control their prices, so that even middle class families can consume them without any hesitation.”
