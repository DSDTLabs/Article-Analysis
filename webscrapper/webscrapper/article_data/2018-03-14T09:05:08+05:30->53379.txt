LUCKNOW: The   notwithstanding, BJP leadership will be on tenterhooks over the unity between the SP and the BSP before the 2019 general elections.

 Of course, the elections to the two parliamentary constituencies held on March 11, for which the result will be declared on Wednesday, are crucial for the ruling BJP, as well as the SP and the BSP as they have come together after 23 years of political rivalry.
 
 If poor polling (48% in Gorakhpur and 38% in Phulpur) is haunting the BJP, the SP-BSP alliance is also concerned if the ruling party will cut into its votes, mainly OBCs and Dalits.
 
 On the other hand, the prestige of both CM Yogi Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya is at stake, as they had campaigned highlighting the performance of their government in one year.
 
 SP president Akhilesh Yadav described his dilemma, saying since he was in Opposition he had nothing to offer to the electorate except his past performance and social engineering of votes. On the day of polling, Akhilesh had also appealed to his supporters and of the BSP, tweeting that it was time to create history and establish their (OBCs, Dalits and Muslims) strength and unity.
 
 BSP chief Mayawati not only announced unconditional support to the SP candidate, but also exhorted her cadres to work wholeheartedly for defeating the BJP. As a result, BSP voters did not show any reluctance in supporting the SP. The Congress though in the fray in both the places, its chances are negligible. If the BJP wins the two seats, the margin will describe the impact of the alliance against it. If it loses, even on one seat, it would provide the much-needed oxygen to the Opposition for 2019 elections.
