Coimbatore: The department of communication and   of Bharathiar University will soon have an amphitheatre on its campus to screen movies and train students on public speaking. 

 The amphitheatre is an 800sqft setup constructed inside a new building for the department. “The civil work for the theatre is over. We are now working out the construction of the studio and the acoustics of the theatre,” said assistant professor of the department M Srihari. 
 
 The construction of the theatre commenced about two years ago. “The idea behind constructing the amphitheatre is to promote screening of movies and public speaking among students. Having constructed the theatre, we also plan to include public speaking activities in the syllabus,” said Srihari. The plan is to ask students to take up one topic and deliver a public speech. 
 
 As an open-air theatre, the setup will also be a change of atmosphere for students from the regular classrooms. “We are involved in classroom teaching predominantly. However, there are practical activities too. The amphitheatre will provide a different experience for students. They can learn videography or organise discussions here,” he said.
 
 The university is presently planning the construction of studio and the acoustics of the theatre. “We have worked out a plan for the construction of a studio and the acoustics of the theatre. We have submitted the proposal to the university administration. The estimated cost for studio, acoustics and air-conditioning of the theatre is about Rs 70lakh,” Srihari said. The theatre’s capacity is 80, and there are 60 students in the department.
 
 This will be first institution where the media studies department will have an amphitheatre. “PSG College of Technology has an amphitheatre. But we will be the first institution where the media studies department will have an amphitheatre for itself,” said Srihari.
