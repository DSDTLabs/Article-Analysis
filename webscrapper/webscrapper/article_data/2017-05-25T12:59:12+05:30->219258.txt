DHARMAPURI: The   administration has issued free house pattas to 11 families who had to leave their crumbling   houses at   near Pennagaram and live in nearby caves. In a report published on May 19, TOI highlighted the plight of the tribals.

  Distributing the pattas here on Wednesday, collector K Vivekanandhan assured the families that each will get a house under the ‘green house’ scheme at the earliest.
 
  “Each house will cost about Rs 1.75 lakh and we will start the construction at the earliest,” the collector told TOI. He said about Rs 18.70 lakh was allotted for this under the Social Economic Development Scheme.
 
 “We have issued free pattas for 11 families and soon the rest will be given pattas and ‘green’ houses after the government formalities are completed,” the collector added.
 
  About 120 people of Pannappatty village had to move to the caves as the houses built by the forest department had become unliveable after heavy rain and wind destroyed them. It was in 1990 that the department constructed 30 houses at the village for scheduled tribe people.
 
 The houses started crumbling within five years. They are now in a dilapidated condition. A few weeks ago, gusty winds accompanied by rain shattered the villagers’ houses and their lives.
 
  After this, the residents had no option but to shift to the caves. They had alleged that the district administration failed to take action on their petitions. They had been threatening to commit suicide if the administration failed to fulfill their demands.
