LUCKNOW:   will discontinue its all engineering courses from the academic session 2018-19. 

 The university offered engineering courses in five streams -  ,  ,  ,   and computer science. They are being discontinued due to poor infrastructure and poor response from students.
 
 "The discussion on the closure of engineering courses was held in the examination committee meeting. There were 300 seats in these courses," said admission coordinator RA Khan. 
 
  had introduced engineering courses in 2013. But owing to lack of infrastructure and placement opportunities the university received a poor response to the courses last year. "One engineering batch has graduated till now. The absence of permanent faculty and low pay packages also failed to attract students last year," said a BBAU official. 
 
 "Around 35% engineering seats remained vacant last year. Even the students who enrolled for the course had to appear for back papers," he added.
