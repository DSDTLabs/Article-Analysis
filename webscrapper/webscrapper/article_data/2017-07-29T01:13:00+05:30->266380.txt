Coimbatore: A three-member gang attacked a 24-year-old bakery worker with sickles at Kurichi Pirivu here over previous enmity on Thursday night, police said.

 The injured man has been identified as S Ramesh, a native of Kalayarkovil, in Sivaganga district. “The three men arrived at the bakery situated at Kurichi Pirivu around 9pm and dragged Ramesh out. Though customers at the bakery tried to stop them, the gang, brandishing weapons, threatened them with dire consequences. Blaming him for ruining their sister’s life, they attacked Ramesh using sickles, resulting in injuries on his check and neck,” a police officer said.
 
 Podanur police rushed him to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, where he is undergone treatment. His condition is said to be stable.
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that Ramesh’s family and another family in Kalayarkovil had a dispute over a temple festival, leading to enmity. His father and younger brother Rajkumar were earlier attacked by a gang over the issue. 
 
 Police collected CCTV footage from the bakery and registered a case against the gang under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. A special team has been formed to nab the gang.
