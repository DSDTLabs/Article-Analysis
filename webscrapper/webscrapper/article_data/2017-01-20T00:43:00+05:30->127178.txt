Jabalpur: Mother of a slain suspected   member – who was killed in an encounter after Bhopal jail break – produced footages revealing conversations between the Bhopal police forces chasing the under-trials.

 Mehmooda, 61, mother of slain Maharashtra-born Khalid Ahmed, who was among the eight slain SIMI men, had approached Jabalpur bench of high court seeking to file a case of murder and criminal conspiracy against Madhya Pradesh Home Minister and Director General of Police besides the Bhopal jail officials for the alleged encounter. She had also asked for registration of a separate FIR to probe circumstances that led to murder of the jail guard. Advocate Naeem Khan submitted footages in a CD before the court on her behalf. 
 
 Next hearing has been posted for February 13. Before moving this PIL, Mehmooda had also submitted a complaint to Solapur (Maharashtra) police seeking action against Home Minister Bhupendra Singh and others alleging that her son was murdered. Khalid was among the SIMI members, who were killed after they escaped from the Bhopal Central jail in a daring pre-dawn jail-break. Sholapur police did not register any case though it had sent a copy to Bhopal police.
 
 She claimed that her son’s murder was “pre-meditated”. CDs also contain two audio clips pertaining to conversations between the police control room and the Bhopal police. It can be heard in the recordings that those involved in the operation were persuaded to use their own mobile phones and communicate less on wireless phones, said sources.
 
 The alleged SIMI men were killed on the city outskirts following their escape from the jail after slitting the throat of a security guard, and scaling the 32-ft wall using bedsheets in the wee hours of October 31.
