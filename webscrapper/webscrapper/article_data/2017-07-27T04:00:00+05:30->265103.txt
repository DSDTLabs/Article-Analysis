Surat: The 57-year-old daily-wage employee facing charges of sexual harassment by a contractual employee in the SVNIT was prohibited from entering the campus till the end of the inquiry against him. The institute authorities also instructed different offices not to allow the accused in their premises.

 The order was issued based on a suggestion by the women’s cell. Earlier on Tuesday, the women’s cell had instructed the institute authorities to prohibit the accused from entering the campus fearing a possibility that he might pressurize the complainant or witnesses.
 
 The cell also asked the institute authorities to initiate a detailed inquiry against the accused and take further legal actions. “We have issued the order prohibiting the person facing the harassment charges from entering the campus. Meanwhile, further actions will be taken as per the guidelines,” said SVNIT director S R Gandhi.
 
 After completing the procedure the institute will hand over the probe to Internal Complaint Committee. Since the accused is not a full time employee the institute is not required to take approval from the Board of Governors. Since the accused is a daily-wage employee he can be dismissed based on the report, an official said.
 
 In her complaint submitted on April 27 the 35-year-old woman alleged that the accused had passed lewd comments in her presence and had also allegedly teased her.
