NEW DELHI: With teachers boycotting evaluation work, the final results of undergraduate courses in   may get delayed. The boycott is to protest the possible grant of autonomy to St Stephen’s, which they have been opposing since last year.

 
 While there is a chance, according to sources, that St Stephen’s might be granted autonomy by next week, teachers for the second week have boycotted all evaluation work in the university. 
 
 Rajib Ray, president  , said the group has written to   and MHRD on the matter and reiterating its demands.
 
 Lately, teachers of Kirori Mal and Hansraj colleges, a part of the centralised evaluation, also took part in the protest.
 
 “Teachers have been boycotting evaluation work since May 9. However, it seems that the government is moving ahead on its agenda of turning colleges and universities of repute into teaching shops,” he said in a statement. 
 
 Ray said the teachers association had demanded “furtherance of the autonomy schemes be suspended till the matter is debated and the performance of the autonomous colleges reviewed”.
