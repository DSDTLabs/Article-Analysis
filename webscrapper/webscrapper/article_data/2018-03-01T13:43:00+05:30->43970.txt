NEW DELHI: The BJP lost the two Madhya Pradesh (MP) bypolls because of "arrogance and misgovernance", tweeted Congress president   today.

 The Congress, which is in the opposition in MP, on Wednesday retained the Mungaoli and Kolaras assembly seats in by-elections in Madhya Pradesh, though with reduced victory margins.
 
 "This is a loss for arrogance and misgovernance and a victory for hope," said the Congress president, referring likely to   in MP later this year. "First Rajasthan and now Madhya Pradesh has proven that the prospect of change is knocking at the door," he tweeted further.
 
 The   said the win in bypolls in Ajmer and Alwar in Rajasthan earlier this month as well for the Congress augurs well for both states which go to the polls later this year.
 
  
  
 
 In Kolaras in MP, Congress candidate Mahendra Singh Yadav defeated the BJP's Devendra Jain by 8,086 votes, an Election Commission (EC) official said.
 
 The Congress candidate got 82,523 votes, while his BJP rival polled 74,437 ballots.
 
 In 2013, Congress had won this seat by a margin of 24,953 votes.
 
 In Mungaoli (Ashok Nagar district), Congress nominee Brajendra Singh Yadav emerged victorious by defeating his BJP rival Bai Sahab Yadav by 2,124 votes. Brajendra Singh Yadav got 70,808 votes, while the BJP candidate bagged 68,684.
 
 The Congress had won this seat by a margin of 20,765 votes in the 2013 assembly polls.
 
 The bypolls, held on February 24, were necessitated by the death of Congress MLAs Mahendra Singh Kalukheda (Mungaoli) and Ram Singh Yadav (Kolaras).
 
 Elated over the victory, senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia -- in whose Lok Sabha constituency, Guna, both these seats fell -- tweeted, "I thank people from the bottom of my heart. Congratulations to all on this victory. I will be with you and stand true to your faith in me, forever (sic)."
 
 "It was a victory of people's faith over the money power," he tweeted further.
