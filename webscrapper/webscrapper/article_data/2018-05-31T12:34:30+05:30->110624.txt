CHARMINAR: Around 55 acres of waqf land belonging to Dargah Syed Rohullah, Madina Masjid and   and Muslim graveyards at   around   and   have been illegally occupied, waqf activists said. The encroachments are slowly eating up the hill on which the masjid is located. 

 
 
 "Over the years, encroachments have increased near this masjid. Waqf board officials inspected the area, but no concrete action has been taken to stop the constructions. About 800 houses have been constructed over the years," said Mohammed Habeebuddin, a waqf activist.
 
 In 2009, land grabbers destroyed a few graves, some of which are over 400 years old, and tried to sell the land. The property was then surveyed by board officials and encroachments were removed.
 
 "Officials visit for inspections every now and then, but they have not been able to stop the encroachments permanently," said Mohammed Khaza Pasha, a masjid committee member.
 
 The land was in the news in 2012 also, when a housing society was constructed for secretariat employees.
 
  "As per court order, the revenue divisional officer and sarpanch cannot construct anything in this land. So, we are serving a notice to the revenue divisional officer reminding them of this, following the court orders." CEO of the Waqf board, Shahnawaz Qasim, said.
