BHOPAL: Union minister   on Wednesday said sharing a meal with Dalits is a “selfpurifying act” and that she feels honoured when Dalits visit her home and have a meal at her table. 

 
 Bharti’s remark came after she skipped a samrasta bhoj (community meal) with Dalits during her visit to MP’s   on Tuesday. “I am not Lord Ram who can share meals with   and purify her, instead I am the one who is purified when Dalits visit my home and have a meal with me,” she said. 
 
 She was in Chhatarpur to unveil a statue of Sant Ravidas where Dalits had organised a community meal under the leadership of a sadhu, Harshu Maharaj. Later,   was asked by journalists why she refused the offer of lunch with Dalits. 
 
 She said she wasn’t aware of the feast and was quoted out of context. About her reference to Lord Ram, she pointed out that she did invoke Lord Ram but in the same breath had said that she would be purified if Dalits share meals at her home. She said that she had already had her lunch, which is why she couldn’t partake of the mass feast. 
 
 TOI was unable to reach her for a comment.
