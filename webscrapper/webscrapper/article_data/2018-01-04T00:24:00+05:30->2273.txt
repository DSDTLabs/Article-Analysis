Jaipur: Rajasthan   has summoned the director general of police (Prisons) to the court on Thursday for failure to comply with its order relating to the release of a prisoner on completion of his term of sentence.

 The division bench of Justice M Rafique and Govardhan Bardhar order followed a habeas corpus petition.
 
 Girraj Sharma, counsel for the petitioner said, the prisoner was convicted in six cases of dishonouring cheque under the Negitiobale Instruments Act. In the first of such cases, he was awarded sentence of three months with fine. In default of payment of fine, the petitioner had to undergo two month additional imprisonment. He was initially taken to custody on August 28, 2013. Thus period of five months had to complete on January 26 2014.
 
 Thereafter in five cases for similar offence he was awarded sentence of different durations, with maximum substantive duration of 18 months. In all the five cases the sentences were to run concurrently in which the total period of sentence for default in payment of fine came to be 19 months to be completed on Feb 25 2015.
 
 However Additional Advocate General (AAG) contended that the default sentence is of one year eight months and ten days which would complete only on Nov 18 2018. The high court then directed additional director general, prisons and district judge Dausa to verify the facts and if found correct may immediately release the petitioner or file a detailed explanation. But the court order was not complied with.
