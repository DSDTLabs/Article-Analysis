CHENNAI: DMK president   asked the then   minister A Raja to resign, despite knowing that the 2G case was a false and foisted one, to enable Parliament to function smoothly. However, the Parliament is now stalled for weeks, but no one in the present dispensation seems to be concerned about it, charged DMK working president M K   here on Wednesday, after releasing a book - ‘Avizhum Unmaigal’, the Tamil version of ‘2G Saga Unfolds’ written by A Raja.

 “This function cannot be seen just as a book release function, but a function to celebrate the freedom of A Raja and party MP   as well as the DMK from the 2G scam,” Stalin said. “Karunanidhi knew it was a false and foisted case. He trusted Raja, but still asked him to resign to set a benchmark. Finally, truth has prevailed,” he said.
 
 Stalin started off his speech by singing the first line of a hit song from a   film – “Raja kaiya veccha, adhu wronga ponadhille….” (If Raja lays his hands on anything, it does not go wrong), sending the hall into raptures. Stalin used the song to drive home Raja’s ability in deftly handling the case all by himself and emerging victorious.
 
 “The very fact that no one has countered my book so far is the best indication that truth was always on my side,” said Raja, about his book that was written around 18 months before the actual verdict was delivered.
