NASHIK: The ABB   has been installed and is working now, while the   signal will be operational in a day or two.

 Earlier, the two locations had traffic islands which had to be replaced in order to manage the overflow of vehicles. The traffic islands were demolished in April.
 
 The signals were installed a few days back, but were not functioning, causing chaos at both the busy circles. The flow of traffic at night has been especially difficult as there are no traffic constables deployed to the area at that time.
 
 “We are making sure that the signals at both places start functioning as soon as possible,” a civic official said.
 
 The initiative to install traffic signals is a joint effort of the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( ) and the traffic police. A total of 10 locations were identified in the city where traffic signals needed to be set up. 
 
 Currently, there are 42 traffic signals that are operational across the city. 
 
 “The Jehan signal will take a day or two to start as the timers are being set. There are some technical issues to be managed. Once that is done, the signal will be operational. Meanwhile, the   signal started on May 1,” said executive engineer of NMC’s electrical department, SP Bankar. 
 
 Meanwhile, the traffic police are implementing other methods to control the heavy traffic flow. “We are taking necessary steps to make the city roads safer and have started initiatives against rash driving and signal jumping,” a police official said.
 
 This year, there have been about 45 fatal accidents in the city, while the same period last year, the police had registered only 44.
