Coimbatore: A 37-year-old businessman received a threat letter purportedly from a banned terrorist outfit on Thursday, asking him to pay Rs 2 lakh.

 Karthik from Nagammanaickenpalayam near Sulur on Thursday received a phone call from an unidentified person who introduced himself as the sub-inspector at Karumathampatti police station. “He said that a friend of Karthik, who met with an accident, told police that he has left a letter near the water tank at Karthik’s house. Karthik rushed to the backyard of the house and found the letter near the tank. The letter said it was written by a terrorist outfit and instructed him to place Rs 2 lakh under an electricity post at Nadupalayam village. It threatened to plant bombs at Karthik's house, his car and other areas. It cautioned against informing police,” a police officer said.
