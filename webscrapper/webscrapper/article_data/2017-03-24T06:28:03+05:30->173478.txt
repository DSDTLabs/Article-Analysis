UDAIPUR: Hundreds of women in remote villages of Kurabad block in Udaipur pledged to plant and protect   trees in order to encourage toilet constructions in the area. 

 On Thursday, on the occasion of ‘Dasha Mata’ poojan, women worshipped peepal trees which is believed to be the home of Goddess  . Volunteers took the opportunity to spread awareness on Swachhta mission. 
 
  (WI) an NGO and its partner   (HVVS) undertook mass peepal plantation in and around places where people openly defecate. 
 
 “Last year over 70 Peepal saplings were planted at places where people openly defecate. The impact was wonderful as people refrained from defecation near the sacred trees. This resulted in construction of more than 400 toilets in three gram panchayats of Kurabad block,” OP Sharma, country director of WI said. 
 
 “This is indeed a different way to stop people from open defecation as this inspires them to construct toilets at their home. We planted these trees last year and today we are worshipping one of them. I constructed the toilet in my house five months ago and asked every woman to do so in my village,” says 52-year-old Bhambri Bai of Bhalo ka Guda gram panchayat.
 
 Due to the diligent efforts of the district administration, support from the public representatives and volunteers 141 of the 544 gram panchayats in Udaipur have become open defecation free, Avichal Chaturvedi, CEO of zila parishad said.
