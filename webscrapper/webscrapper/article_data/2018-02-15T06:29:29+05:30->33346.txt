HYDERABAD: In a strong rebuke to All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief  , who has pointed out that five of the six soldiers killed in the terror attack at Sunjuwan military camp were Kashmiri Muslims, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Northern Command, Lt. Gen.  , said on Wednesday that the   was above religion.

 Without naming the Hyderabad MP, the GOC-in-C said that those who were “communalising” soldiers don't know the   well. “In Army, there is a ‘sarva dharma sthal’ (common worship place for all religions),” he said while responding to a query at a press conference.
 
 On Tuesday, Owaisi had slammed those questioning the patriotism of Indian Muslims saying, “Five Kashmiri Muslims have laid down their lives. Why aren't you talking about it? This is a reminder to all those nationalists who question my integrity and love for this country.”
 
 
 
 Owaisi had followed this up by criticising Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Twitter on Wednesday, saying none of his ministers had visited the family of CRPF constable Mujahid Khan in Ara. Khan was killed in a terror attack on a CRPF camp in Srinagar on Monday. Owaisi’s tweet triggered a storm on social media with some supporting him while others criticised him for “communalising” the soldiers’ sacrifice.
 
 Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the demography of the area indicates local support to terrorists. Expressing condolence, she assured the nation that their sacrifice will not go in vain. Regarding the reports that the terror attack was a joint operation by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, the GOC-in-C said there was no difference among terror outfits. “Hizbul Mujahideen, Jaish and Lashkar—all of them are involved in planning attacks across the state. All three outfits are hand in gloves whether it is in the Valley or in Jammu,” Anbu said.
