AHMEDABAD: Four days after the   of Kodar Gamar — the 65-year-old tribal man who was accused of the crime of slaughtering an ox — his son and activists on Monday made a representation to the state government, seeking a fair probe in the case.

 Khumu Gamar, Kodar’s son, said they also tried to meet minister of state (MoS) for home Pradipsinh Jadeja, but as he was busy at another meeting, handed over the memorandum to his secretary instead.
 
 Gamar was one of the five persons accused in a case of cow slaughter at   village of Poshina taluka of   district. He died in police custody on May 4. Human rights activists and his relatives suspected the custodial death was caused by police brutality during remand.
 
 The representation of another son of Kodar, Bhemabhai, to the state government, says, “PSI A S Rabari of   police station and his staff had brutally beaten Gamar which led to his death. He also demanded a bribe of Rs 5 lakh to not torture my father. As we are poor tribals, we could not pay the sum. Please direct the CBI probe in the case so that we, poor tribals, can get justice.” The representation has been made to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani with copies marked to Jadeja and Sabarkantha district superintendent of police (SP) P L Mall.
