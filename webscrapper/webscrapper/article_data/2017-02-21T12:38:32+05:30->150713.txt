PANAJI: While the mushrooming of new festivals is not an alien  , the state will soon see a festival on sustainable living and learning. 

 Scheduled to be held between February 24 to 26 at  , the event combines hands-on workshops on green skills, sound healing and mindfulness. The festival is about a quest to go back to living in harmony with nature while learning on how to improve our own potential, said organizers.
 
 Visitors can buy tickets at Rs 300 per day for access to the various workshops and sustainable living skills. They can also buy green products, have organic food and beverages and listen to acoustic music.
 
 “Through this event, we are trying to create a system where it becomes more of an aspiration to have sustainable goods and inculcate the same in our lifestyle,” said Waylon D’souza, an industrial designer who is a participant.
 
 The event is being organized jointly by the Centre for Ethical Life and Leadership, a non-profit organisation, and Observing I, a sustainable technologies and services company. It will be partnered by Google’s  , which will have its own booth at the event. For pre-registration and tickets, visit www.seesharpfest.com.
