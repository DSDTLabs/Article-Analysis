Nagpur: Officiating chief engineer Dipak Sontakke left deputation posting at Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and returned to state public works department even before inquiry into alleged errors in common schedule of rates (CSR) began. Sontakke is said to be upset with allegations levelled against him in the general body meeting held on February 20. Senior BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari had exposed various types errors in new CSR meant for civic works. He held Sontakke responsible for the mistakes and demanded action against him.  Mayor Nanda Jichkar directed municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal to conduct an inquiry and send Sontakke to his original department if found guilty. NMC sources told TOI Sontakke requested Mudgal to relieve him from NMC a day after general body meeting.  “Only Sontakke cannot be responsible for mistakes in CSR. Preparing a CSR is a big task and Sontakke was the final signing authority. CSR was prepared by a layer of engineers. Tiwari was upset with Sontakke as the latter had asked for re-tendering in one of the works related to the former’s ward. Therefore, Tiwari exposed errors in CSR with the help of engineers and contractors,” sources said. Sontakke had three charges — chief engineer and two posts of superintending engineer. Charge of chief engineer and superintending engineer (public works) has been given to executive engineer Manoj Talewar and superintending engineer (water works) to executive engineer Sanjay Gaikwad.  The posts of chief engineer and two posts of superintending engineers are of deputation and filled with experienced officials by the state government. An NMC official told TOI that the executive engineers have been given temporary charge till new postings by the government.
