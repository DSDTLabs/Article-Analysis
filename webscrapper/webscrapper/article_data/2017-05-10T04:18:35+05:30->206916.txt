New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought to know if Indian-origin doctors,   from practising by a foreign country, can be prohibited from treating patients in India.

 A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice V K Rao raised the query while taking note of a news report that an Indian-origin doctor, barred from practising by a US court is now treating patients in the National Capital Region (NCR).
 
 The court noted that the report had claimed that mechanisms governing medical practice in India were ill-equipped to detect such cases which enabled such doctors to practice in India. It directed the member secretary of Delhi State Legal Services Authority, Sanjeev Jain, to verify the name and address of this doctor, carry out an immediate probe and file a report within four days.
 
 Besides this, the court also issued notice to the   asking it to file a report on the mechanism, statutory regime as well as rules and regulations in place to scrutinise and check such practices.
 
 The bench further sought the response of the ministry of health and family welfare before the next date of hearing on May 15.
 
 As per the report the doctor had pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual battery and was asked to surrender all US medical licences, leave the country and “not practice medicine in any form within the United States or any other country,” the court noted in its order.
 
 However, he continues to run a clinic each in Delhi and Gurgaon.
