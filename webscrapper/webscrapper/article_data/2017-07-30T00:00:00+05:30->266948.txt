Her last release was more than a year ago, and while   has been busy with other projects, she has been maintaining a low profile, until now. Her next,  , which marks the directorial debut of award-winning cinematographer  , is slated for release soon and the actress is elated.
“When the team first approached me for the role, I was excited for multiple reasons. For starters, there is Das sir, in whose cinematography I was sure to be presented beautifully onscreen. Second, it paired me with   for the first time in a role that is meaty and different from the ones I have played earlier. The production team was looking at leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the film is rich in content and presentation and that appealed to me. Add to this, the songs were composed by   and I had no reason to say no to this role. It is impossible to refuse a film that has so many award winners onboard,” Milana reasons.
 The fact, though, is that the actress is one of two heroines in the film. “That was never a deterrent for me. I only look at the quality of my role and not my screen time. Even though my character, an NRI girl, appears only in the second half of the film, she brings in a crucial twist in the narrative. It is characters like these that audiences will notice,” she says.
 Apart from the experience of working with this team, what the actress cherishes is how accommodating they were. “Once, we were set to shoot a schedule in Mangaluru, but I couldn’t make it, as I was struck with dengue fever, which left me out of action for a couple of weeks. In a film like this, which involves people with very hectic schedules, it is difficult to change things around in the last minute as there will be issues in matching everyone's dates again. Yet there were no complaints and the team waited patiently till I could resume work,” she says.
