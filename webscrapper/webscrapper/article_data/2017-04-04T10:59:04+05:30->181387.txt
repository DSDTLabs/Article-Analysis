PANAJI: Unhappy with the authorities turning a blind eye to able bodied people occupying   spaces reserved for persons with disabilities (PWD) in the capital, the Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG) has decided to implement the rule itself.

 The association has put up signboards next to reserved parking spots creating awareness among public that it is a criminal offence for others to occupy parking spaces reserved for them.
 
 “Members of the association will personally monitor these parking spaces. We have noticed that it is not the illiterate, but the highly educated people who ignore the signs. We have been forced to implement it ourselves because of the failure of the authorities to do the same,” said association president Avelino D’Sa.
 
 As per Section 69 of the Persons with Disability Act, any person who fraudulently avails of any benefit meant for persons with disabilities, shall be punishable with imprisonment or with a fine or with both.
 
 There are about 10 locations in the   municipal area which have reserved parking spaces for persons with disabilities—directorate of social welfare, Panaji police station, collectorate of North Goa district, basement of the municipal market of CCP, Junta House compound, Shramshakti Bhavan, Maquinez Palace compound, Kala Academy, Kadamba bus stand complex and Inox compound.
