 Cops learned about the victim, Rahul Shinde (name changed), while probing an earlier case involving a gay police constable. He too had registered on the site and was similarly robbed by the trio. Ashok Bhorde, senior inspector of Kurla railway police, said, “While we were conducting a search at Khan’s residence in the constable’s case, we found Shinde’s Aadhar card. We contacted him and his story unfolded. We have registered a second FIR against the three accused and booked them for robbery and also under the Information Technology Act.” 
 
 Cops have found that Arbaz is not gay but had registered on the site to rob people.
 
 “I met a like-minded man with the username Khanbhai2 (Arbaz) while surfing the site and we began to chat on WhatsApp. We decided to meet at Ghatkopar. As soon as we sat near the tracks, two men turned up.” One of them slapped Arbaz and accused him of cheating his cousin by marrying her despite being in love with Shinde. He slapped Shinde too and asked him to pay a “penalty” of Rs 50,000 for “ruining her life”. Shinde handed over his iPhone and asked them to sell it. The duo then snatched two of his cards and forced him to disclose the PINs. They went to an ATM kiosk but could only withdraw Rs 4,000—the then limit post-demonetization. 
 
 “They went to a mall and used the cards to buy a phone, two mixer-grinders and four deodorants,” said inspector Rajendra Bhonsale.
