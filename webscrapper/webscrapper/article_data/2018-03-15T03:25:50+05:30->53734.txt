NEW DELHI:   wants the   to consider if punishment for chain   can be made more stringent.

 On Tuesday, the government informed Delhi high court that it has written to the Centre to consider amending the penal provisions that deal with crimes of chain snatching in the national capital. It cited the example of   and Haryana, which have made chain snatching a separate offence after amending the law.
 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar then asked the Union ministry of home affairs to file a status report on the action taken by it on the letter written by Delhi government and its stand on the issue.
 
 HC’s direction came while hearing a PIL by advocate Prashant Manchanda who alleged that chain snatchings in Delhi have seen a six-fold rise leading to a “fear psychosis” in the minds of citizens as well as tourists. Manchanda sought a stringer response to the crime, prompting the bench to acknowledge that the petition raised a serious concern.
 
 The plea claimed that on an average, there are 25 snatching cases every day in Delhi due to the “absence of effective laws” and “indifference” of the police, who book offenders under the “trivial provisions” of theft, instead of robbery or dacoity, even though weapons are used to commit such crimes.
 
 Manchanda contended that   was booking offenders of such a crime under milder provisions which entail a punishment of only up to three years. He added that even without a specific offence under the law to make snatching a separate offence, the offenders could be booked under section 390 (robbery) of the IPC as it uses the word ‘fear of wrongful restraint’ and carries a jail term of up to 10 years.
