JAIPUR: Except at a few places in Sawai Madhopur district, south west monsoon has remained elusive for rest of the state in the past one week. It is unlikely to revive in next couple of days due to factors including upper air cyclonic circulation and western disturbances. In the absence of rainfall, majority of the places witnessed rise in their maximum and minimum temperatures. 

 Bonli (Sawai Madhopur) received a rainfall of 50 mm which was highest in the state. However, in rest of the state, south west monsoon has been elusive for the last one week. There has not been a rainfall activity in the state despite rise in the humidity level up to 80 percent. 
 
 Attributing the dampening of monsoon winds to the active upper air cyclonic circulation and western disturbances,   office said that in next couple of days, rainfall activity may revive in the state as these factors are likely to vanish. "The impact of western disturbances and upper air cyclonic circulation is presently seen in the western and northern parts of Rajasthan. From Tuesday onwards, this would vanish and thus monsoon activity could revive," said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. 
 
 In the absence of monsoon rainfall, Churu remained hottest in the state where a maximum temperature of 42.2 degrees Celsius was recorded,   41.9, Bikaner and Pilani 39.6 degrees Celsius each, Jaisalmer 39.0, Jaipur 38.7, Barmer 38.0, Jodhpur 37.5, Kota 35.9 and a maximum temperature of 34.2 degrees Celsius was recorded in Udaipur.
