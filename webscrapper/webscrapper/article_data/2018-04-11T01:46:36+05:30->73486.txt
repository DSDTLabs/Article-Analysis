Actor   has revealed that she is "camera-shy" when she is with her family as the moments are "much more intimate" than acting in a film. 

 
  
 According to a report, the 26-year-old model-actress admitted that she gets "super embarrassed and nervous" in front of the camera when her loved ones are around. 
 
 "When I'm acting, it's a character, and when it's modelling, it's a fantasy world. Even when I'm taking pictures for my  , that's a specific second of a world; that's not reality," she said. 
 
 "Sometimes, when my friends take a picture of me on vacation, or I'm with my husband, I feel camera shy. When my husband pulls out the camera, I get super embarrassed and nervous, because it's so much more intimate and honest and really us," she added.
