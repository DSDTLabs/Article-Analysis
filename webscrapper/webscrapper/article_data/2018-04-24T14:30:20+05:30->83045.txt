PANAJI: State   president Shantaram Naik said that Rajya Sabha chairman and vice-president Venkaiah Naidu’s decision to reject the motion to impeach Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra was wrong as   was not empowered to take a decision. 

 “The chairman’s duty was only to confirm whether 50 members have signed the notice,” Naik said. “The chairman should have admitted the notice and constituted a three-member committee as required under Section 3 of the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, to look into the motion.” 
 
 The former Rajya Sabha MP, who was also the chairman of the Rajya Sabha standing committee on law and justice, said, “It was improper for the chairman to assume the role of the three-member committee, which the chairman conveniently avoided to constitute.”
 
 Goa Pradesh Congress Committee also brushed aside criticism that Congress MPs should not have gone public with their motion to impeach the  . Calling such arguments “ridiculous”, Naik said that “matters which are sensitive and involve public interest” have been given advance publicity earlier.
 
 “A number of leaders from the present ruling party, when they were in opposition, left no opportunity to give advance publicity to their notices,” Naik said. “Venkaiah Naidu, when he was a minister in the NDA government, used to raise matters in the Rajya Sabha even without giving required notice.”
 
 The Congress also said that directions issued by the chairman of the Rajya Sabha cannot be equated to the rules of procedure of the Rajya Sabha. “The direction itself says ‘as per parliamentary practices and conventions’,” Naik said.
