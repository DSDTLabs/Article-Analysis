LUCKNOW: Farmers from across 60 districts of UP gathered in Lucknow on Thursday and staged a protest rally organised by   (UPKS) under the aegis of   (AIKS) that had recently organised a massive march of farmers in Maharashtra. 

  ground, the rally venue, was painted red with flags and placards carrying slogans about farmer angst. It was the first such farmers' rally in UP after a long time. 
 
 AIKS national president,  , said that the struggle will go on and a bigger protest will be organised in coming days. 
 
 "Both Central and state governments are anti-farmer and pro-industrialist who fund elections. They made a mockery of loan waiver that was promised to farmers. The BJP has just seen the result in UP bypolls," said Dhavale, addressing farmers. 
 
 Former MP   said, "We all stand together. Next time, we will not leave Lucknow till our demands our met. This message should go across all villages and a bigger march will be organised." 
 
 The farmers demanded one-and-a-half times of the farmer's production cost as minimum support price, loan waiver, roll back of power tariff hike, privatization in seven districts, removing restrictions on animal trade, Rs 5,000 in pension to every farmer and labourer over 60 years of age, cheap ration to all and improving law and order ensuring safety of women, dalits and minorities.
