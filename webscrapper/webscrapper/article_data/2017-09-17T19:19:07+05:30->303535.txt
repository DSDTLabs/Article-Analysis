  A Karnataka cadre officer of 2007 batch,   was found dead on May 17, soon after celebrating his 36th birthday with batchmates and close friends at the state guest house located at Meerabai Marg. His body was found on the roadside, barely 150 metre away from the guest house in the wee hours.
 
 While Lucknow police maintained that Anurag died due to some medical complication which was apparently induced by drug overdose, his family felt otherwise. A case against unidentified persons was registered under murder charges and state government had referred the case to the CBI.
 
 Having taken over the case on June 17, CBI sleuths have camped in the city earlier in June and July for a forthnight. The team then visited Bengaluru and met some key government officials. Anurag was posted as commissioner, food civil supplies in Karnataka.
 
  The team also interacted with a senior bureaucrat in Karnataka who was Anurag’s mentor at one time. Anurag shared the tips to crack civil services with the bureaucrat’s daughter when she was appearing for the examination and was close to the family.
 
  
  
 
 
 “As the family had told us Anurag was being harassed by senior officers in Karnataka, we have met with people who were close to Anurag in the southern state,” said a source working on the case.
