 Shirke narrated Ravan-Mandodari samvad and used her familiarity with theatre to embellish her performance. "Kathak means to narrate a katha. So, I thought I should narrate the story of   through my act. Since, I am also a theatre person, it wasn't difficult for me to teach all my students to bring out all the required expressions. Also, to learn the art of storytelling, I went to Ayodhya to see how the Kathak community there narrates the story of Ramayan. I then decided to blend the modern technique of Kathak to narrate this story," said Shirke.

 Though the act was one-and-a-half hour long, Vedanti Mahadik, one of the students of Shirke, said that she didn't feel tired while performing. "Since our act had a pinch of drama in it, it wasn't tiresome. I loved performing today," she said.

 The act was so powerful that the audience couldn't help but praise it. "The energy that all the dancers brought on stage was incomparable. I liked how Rajashreeji managed to bring back the past to us," said Shanta Sen, a resident of Mayur Vihar, who had come for the event.
