AHMEDABAD: A   hearing the 2008   has said that the accused cannot get any books that are not available in the   and that are uncensored. The court rejected a request by accused persons for access to books from outside on the grounds put forth by the Sabarmati jail authority, that certain books are difficult to be censored by the jail staff these days. Some 50 undertrials at   filed an application before special judge A R Patel, complaining that they are not allowed access to books brought by their family members. Their advocate, D D Pathan, argued that some of these prisoners are to take various exams and they pursue their studies accordingly. However, when they do not get proper books from the prison library, their family members bring them such books. Jail authorities do not allow access to these books. One such book was an English dictionary brought for an architecture student, who was arrested from Bengaluru. 

 The accused personsâ€™ advocate submitted that the jail manual nowhere prohibits access to books for prisoners and jail authorities are bound to provide them books because it is considered a reformative action.
 
 The state government opposed the demand and submitted that the library at Sabarmati Central Jail has nearly 17,000 books on various religions. The Sabarmati Central Jail authority filed a report stating that if a prisoner needs a book, he may place a request with the authority and the book is made available.
 
 The blasts suspects are denied access to certain books by the jail authority, following allegations that after studying engineering books, 24 of them dug a 213-metre tunnel in an escape bid.
