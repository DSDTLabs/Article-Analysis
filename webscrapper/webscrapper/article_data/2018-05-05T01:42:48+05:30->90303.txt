 Anant Kumar, president of the society’s association said, “In view of the potential cost savings and environmental benefits, the society members took an unanimous decision to install the rooftop solar”. He added, “The business model offered by the installer wherein the society doesn’t have to invest any amount, led to the quick decision.” 
 
 Solarise Dwarka initiative aims at raising awareness through outreach campaigns for aggregating demand of solar rooftop systems. On the occasion, Dr Winfried Damm, energy cluster coordinator at GIZ, said, “The solar plant will be able to offset around 32% of a resident’s annual carbon emission.”
