A day after his younger brother   drowned in   reservoir,  , in a state of deep shock, narrates to   the horrific tale that unfolded in front of him

 Our team of 20 students from Chennai came to Pune by train. We checked into a bungalow about 2km from the summer camp site at 3am on Wednesday and went to sleep.
 
 All of us went to   — the camp — around 11am. We had several exciting sessions throughout the day. After learning yoga and meditation for an hour, 11 of us decided to visit the lake.
 
 We sought permission of teachers. Initially, they refused. But after repeated requests, they allowed us. A teacher came with us.
 
 First, we sat on the rock near the dam. Then, a few of us decided to wade into the water around 5.30pm. My brother Danish and I also took a plunge for relief after a hot day.
 
 One of the students had brought biscuits with him. He and two others, including Danish, went deep into the water to feed biscuits to fishes. Within a few minutes, they started struggling in the water.
 
 Since none of us could swim we failed to reach out to them. They were so close, yet so far. 
 
 Helpless, I screamed. The teacher who accompanied us sought help of some villagers who dived in and brought my brother to the surface.
 
 I didn’t know what to do. He was very much alive in the ambulance. He was taken to a hospital, but doctors said it was all over.
 
 Later, I was told that the two others had also died.
 
 The situation could have been completely different if one or two of us knew swimming and the biscuits were not carried to the dam.
