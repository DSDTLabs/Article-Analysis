PUNE: The Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited board on Saturday decided to cancel the bid of a private firm for executing the adaptive traffic management system project in the city and float  .

 The decision comes against the backdrop of some elected members of the   questioning the tendering process. Corporators had alleged that a specific company was given preference by the administration setting aside rules. The company had submitted a bid of Rs336 crore.
 
 The project would be executed as a part of the Smart Cities Mission. After the board meeting,   corporator Chetan Tupe — one of the board members — told reporters, “Many firms had submitted bid with much lower amount. But there was a deliberate effort to give the work to the specific company. We discussed this issue and everyone agreed that there were many unanswered questions in the tendering process. It was decided to retender the project.”
 
 The proposal to stop the board members from speaking to the media was also discussed. No final decision was taken but it was decided that the Pune municipal commissioner and the PSCDCL head would brief the media after the board meetings.
