JAIPUR: National Law University, Delhi, topper   of Jaipur missed the first slot in CLAT result by 1.5 marks. Kaushik scored 157.5/200 while the topper, who was his batch mate, scored 159/200. 

 
 What drew his interest in law was judicial activism in the form of suo motu cognizance, PILs and orders embodying the spirit of the Indian constitution. "The judges exercise their power to act within the purview of law and the constitution. They step in to prevent the democratic institutions from crumbling. The way the   heard the case overnight after the   party challenged the controversial order of Karnataka governor granting 15 days to   for forming government," said Kaushik. 
 
 He aspires to become an   officer or a judicial officer (judge). "In both the professions, I would be working to protect and implement laws," said Kaushik, who passed out from Cambridge Court High School. Kaushik, who has been reading judgements, bills and proceedings in the parliament since Class IX to shape his opinion on all burning issues, wants to study at National Law University, Bangalore.
 
 The judgement which had the most powerful influence on him was triple talaq judgement by a five-member bench of Supreme Court last year. "That judgement had restored the faith of people in the judiciary. A similar judgement was delivered by the apex court in the eighties in the case of Shah Bano but was overturned by the politicians. After more than two decades, same judiciary delivered the judgement granting respite to Muslim women," said Kaushik.
