GURUGRAM: The district administration has decided to build a   for   in Sector 52, almost a year after locals started demanding for it.   had earlier allotted a site for the community centre, but it was at a distance from the village. The plot now allotted was originally proposed for a police station.

 A few weeks ago, PWD minister Rao Narbir Singh had visited the village, and the residents had again raised the issue and asked that the centre be shifted to a plot in Sector 52 near their village. The land earlier allotted for the centre is adjoining sectors 52A and 53. Singh ordered that the plots be interchanged after a state-level meeting in Chandigarh last week.
 
 The decision will benefit around 8,200 residents living in around 1,460 houses in the village.   is spread over sectors 52 and 56. While villagers expressed satisfaction over the move, many felt that one community centre isn’t enough for such a large population. “It is a large area and there should be at least two community centres,” said Sube Singh, former sarpanch, Wazirabad.
 
 “The announcement for the community centre was made by the CM. We have given possession of the land to MCG,” said Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer-2, HUDA.
