PATNA:   (PU) academics on Thursday recalled the contributions of B R Ambedkar in fighting for   and human rights much before these issues attained significance in India.

 Addressing a seminar on ‘Ambedkar, Democracy and Social Justice in India’ organized by the Ambedkar Centre for Dalit Studies on the eve of Ambedkar’s 126th birth anniversary, the scholars observed that the Indian Constitution was greatly influenced by the revolutionary ideas of the social reformer. “Ambedkar’s vision of a casteless society cannot be implemented until we have a classless society,” said PU geography department head K N Paswan.
 
 According to PU philosophy department head R S Arya, Ambedkar ensured a proper place for the Dalits in the Constitution while drafting it. “He pleaded for equal rights to both daughters and sons and introduced Hindu code bills to codify and reform Hindu personal law in India,” he said.
 
 In his presidential remarks, social science faculty and former dean   said Ambedkar stood for democracy and social justice. He added, “The democratic institutions in India are weakening day by day and social justice has been reduced to casteism and reservation.”
 
 Association for Study and Action (ASA) secretary   proposed the vote of thanks.
