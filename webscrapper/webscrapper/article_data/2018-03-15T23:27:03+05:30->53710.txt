Vijayawada: Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has finally decided to take stern steps to clear plastic wastes stagnated in irrigation   across the city. Civic bodies along with Andhra Pradesh Amaravati Development Corporation (APADC) will be spearheading this project to give a new shape to three major irrigation canals across the city estimates being prepared. 

 Irrigation canals in the city are currently in pathetic condition with tonnes of plastic and construction wastes being dumped into it.
 
  But with VMC taking up the project in hand, hopes of having clean irrigation canals are not far for locals. VMC already did praiseworthy work by transforming the urination spot at canal bund near Vijaya Talkies bridge to a selfie point will also be transforming canal bunds on Eluru canal. 
 
 Municipal Commissioner J. Nivas inspected Eluru locks at Railway station junction a week ago and he was utterly unimpressed after seeing tonnes of plastic wastes stagnated at irrigation canal. He has directed officials to clear garbage and asked to engage around 500 sanitation workers and JCB machines to clear plastic wastes as quickly as possible.
 
 VMC also conducted anti-mosquito larvae spraying in the city at various places in stagnated canals considering severe mosquito menace. 
 
 “Mosquito menace has reduced in our colony after VMC swung into action and did anti larva spraying in canals. We are requesting officials to clear garbage dumped on canal bunds to reduce stink,” P. Durga Rao a resident of Durga Agraharam said.
