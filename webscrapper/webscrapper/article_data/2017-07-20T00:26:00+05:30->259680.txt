Margao: Fifty-two-year-old Umesh Rama Naik from Curchorem, who had gone missing while on pilgrimage to Amarnath since July 9, returned home on Wednesday as mysteriously as he had disappeared.  He arrived Wednesday morning in a disheveled condition, with deep injuries all over his body, and disoriented. He was rushed to the primary health centre, Cacora, and later shifted to Hospicio, Margao, where he is currently undergoing treatment. Doctors said he has been starving for the last few days and has sustained multiple external as well as soft tissue injuries. Speaking to reporters from his hospital bed, Naik said he was among a group of 13 pilgrims on the way to Amarnath, but found himself lost at Katra in Jammu and Kashmir. Speaking in somewhat incoherent voice, Naik said that all his belongings, including money and clothes, were robbed. Penniless Naik spent a few days on the footpaths of Katra, in the hope that his fellow pilgrims would find him. He would make do with alms people threw at him taking him to be a beggar. Naik approached the Katra police station where the cops helped him board a New Delhi-bound bus. After reaching New Delhi, Naik says, he headed towards the railway station where a good Samaritan helped him board a Goa-bound train. Naik says he doesnâ€™t remember how and when he sustained so many injuries.
