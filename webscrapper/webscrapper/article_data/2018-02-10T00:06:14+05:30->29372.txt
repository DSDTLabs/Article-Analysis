CHENNAI: In an act of revenge, two men hacked to death a 50-year-old railway employee after barging into his house inside the residential area of Chennai Pattai Salai in Villivakkam on Friday.

 J K Puthiyavan was also the general secretary of the Southern Railway OBC Employees Welfare Association. Police said Puthiyavan was alone at home when his former driver Baskar, 32, and his friend Anand, 35, barged into his house at 9am. Hearing his cries, the neighbours came to the rescue and took him to ICF hospital where he died.
 
 Later in the evening, Baskar and his friend Anand surrendered before ICF police. Police sources said Baskar was working as Puthiyavan’s driver two years ago and had asked for a government job. The later had promised a job but demanded Rs3.50 lakh. “Since there was no job, Baskar asked his money be returned. Puthiyavan is believed to have refused and threatened to lodge a fake police complaint,” said a police officer. Following this, Baskar plotted to kill him. 
 
 The duo was booked for murder and remanded in judicial custody.
