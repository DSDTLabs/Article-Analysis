HYDERABAD: Several NGOs have urged India not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).The RCEP is part of a   nations' initiative towards liberalising trade and investment in the region.

 If the country does join the partnership, it will put into serious jeopardy the future of several sectors in the country including agriculture and animal husbandry that are among the largest employment sectors, the NGOs say.
 
 The RCEP meet, set to be held here from July 24 for five days, is expected to be inaugurated by Union commerce & industry minister  . Among countries taking part in the RCEP meeting in the city are China and   in addition to other   member states and others. The NGOs, nearly 30 of them, have scheduled a rival 'People's Summit' which they say is 'against free trade agreements and RCEP' with a people's convention scheduled for July 23. Kiran Vissa representing the   says there are several provisions in the RCEP agreements which will have a direct and devastating impact on agriculture and allied sectors. One of the many RCEP proposals that the NGOs are opposed to is one that seeks to allow member states the same rights to purchase land as domestic investors, particularly farm land.
 
 “Small dairy and other farmers will go out of business,“ Vissa warns as “RCEP will open the Indian market to unfair competition from highly subsidised producers from Japan, New Zealand and Australia,“ he said. Among other fears that the NGOs have are an unchecked proliferation of genetically modified organisms, particularly seeds.
