MYSURU: Calling the   the ‘Dharma Grantha (holy book)’ of the country, former MLC KC Puttasidda Shetty on Sunday expressed anguish over BJP’s   posing a threat to the values enshrined in the Constitution.

 Shetty, who was at a seminar on ‘Hindutva v/s Indian Constitution’ organised by the Karnataka Rajya Pragathipara Chintakara Vedike at the   hall, said that a conspiracy was afoot to reintroduce the codes and strictures of Manusmriti in today’s India. “There is a conspiracy to do away with Reservation in the country by the ruling party. Reservation should be given based on population,” said Shetty.
 
 Prof. BP Mahesh Chandra Guru, of the University of Mysore, dubbed the Hindutva ideology was the country’s biggest epistemic enemy. “Accepting Hindutva is akin to accepting slavery. Indian Constitution promotes welfare of all people, while Hindutva only supports the development of a few. Prime Minister   is doing everything against the spirit of the Constitution. Modi and company are destroying the country. Communal violence is raging in coastal Karnataka because the BJP has been advocating Hindutva,” Prof. Chandra Guru said.
 
 The academic said that he was offered police protection in the wake of the death of  . “But I refused police protection. I am not afraid of anybody. If I am killed, I will become a hero and my assailants will turn into villains. Nobody can stifle my voice against Hindutva and the BJP by threatening me,” he said.
 
 Pontiff of the Urilingapeddi Mutt Jnanaprakash Swami, Swaraj India convener for Mysuru Prof. Shabbir Mustafa were among those in attendance at the seminar.
