CHENNAI: Water tankers operating in south Chennai and its suburbs went on an indefinite strike on Monday in response to officials impounding five tankers for pumping out groundwater from residential areas last week. 

 IT firms along OMR that generate business worth 100 crore every day could be the worst hit if the strike continues as it did in 2013, forcing many firms to suspend activity. 
 
 Private water tanker operators supply water at a cost of 800- 1200 for a 12,000-litre load to residents, IT firms and commercial establishments. They draw groundwater from agricultural fields in the suburbs by paying farmers a price they agree upon. Officials, however, want to make it mandatory for these operators to get permission from the state groundwater authorities before drawing water. 
 
 Thiruporur revenue department officials impounded two tankers on March 1 and three more the following day. The owners of the impounded tankers had drawn water from fields in Ponmar and Polacheri in  , following which residents of these neighbourhoods complained to officials.
 
 A Thiruporur revenue department official said, "We have levied a fine of 2,000 from each on the impounded tankers but the owners are unwilling to pay." 
 
 South Chennai Private Tanker Lorry Owners' Association, which controls around 1,200 tankers, went on strike at 6am on Monday.
 
 Nasscom, the trade association of software companies, is already feeling the heat. Its regional director K Purushothaman said, "If the strike continues beyond Tuesday, it is likely to affect regular operations. Such instability will hurt Brand   as IT firms along OMR cater to clients in the US and Europe." 
 
 South Chennai Private Tanker Lorry Owners' Association president   said, "Government officials treat us like criminals for drawing water from these fields. The strike will continue until we are allowed to conduct business fairly."
