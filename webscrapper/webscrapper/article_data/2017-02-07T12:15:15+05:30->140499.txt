RAJKOT: A day after he slapped   MP Shanker Vegad in  , Rambhai  , a resident of Amrapar village was arrested on Monday by the local crime branch. 

 However, the 35-year-old was arrested in connection with a month-old case registered against him at Dhrangadhra police station. According to police, Jaspalsinh Zala, a local advocate, had lodged a complaint against Labadiya on January 27 for slapping him in the court compound in   over some issue.
 
 Hirabhai Sindhav, assistant sub-inspector, lodged a non-cognizable offence against Labadiya in the B-division police station of Surendranagar town.
 
 LCB PSI AD Parmar told TOI that Labadiya has a criminal past and 31 offences that include two of murder, three under Prohibition Act, extortion and assaults, have been lodged against him in various police stations in the district.
 
 Vegad has not lodged any formal complaint against Labadiya who slapped him in full public view at a mass wedding function organized by the   community. Just as he arrived to speak on the dais, Labadiya climbed the stage and snatched his mike. He then slapped him and shouted, “What have you done for the Bharwad community?”
 
 After slapping the Surendranagar MP, Labadiya did not flee from the spot but gave interview to local news channels where he justified his act. Labadiya accused Vegad of fuelling enmity between Bharwad and Koli communities. 
 
 The caste war between Kolis and Bharwads is turning serious in Surendranagar where the latter are migrating from Koli-dominated villages. The slapping incident has not gone down well with the community.
 
 Labadiya, while talking to TOI on Sunday, feared that now he will not be safe as bitterness between the two communities is escalating.
 
 “There was a time when Kolis and Bharwads were living peacefully. My wife was elected unopposed in Koli-dominated village Amrapar. But situation has changed for worse now. My own house was set alight by Kolis in Amarapar three years ago,” Labadiya claimed.
