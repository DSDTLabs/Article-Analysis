NEW DELHI: Environment minister   held a meeting on Tuesday with the forest department and PWD to assess the progress of the upcoming wildlife bird   centre in southwest Delhi’s Rajokri. According to forest officials, the project will finish in nine months and is being built at an estimated cost of Rs 9 crore.

 The   aims to nurse injured birds as well as provide veterinary facilities for diseased birds — with only one such bird hospital currently present in Delhi for the purpose. Spread over an area of nearly two acres, the Rajokri centre will have separate sections for small birds, birds of medium size and large birds, as well as have a special recovery zone and ICU.
 
 “The project is being carried out with technical support from PWD. Special facilities will be provided to cater to birds of different sizes,” said a forest official.
 
 The minister has further directed the department to ensure there is dense tree cover around the centre so there are no major temperature variations which could affect the birds’ health. He also asked the forest department to add a section in the centre for rescued snakes and small mammals.
