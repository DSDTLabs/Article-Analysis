PUNE: For all its tough talk, businessmen and locals say the Pune Cantonment Board's ( ) drive against illegal hawkers has yielded little. 

 Hawking of any kind is illegal in the cantonment areas, and there are no provisions to regularise the practice. But almost every part of the civil area - including the busy MG Road and East Street - and the civilian settlements of   and Wanowrie are flooded with hawkers.
 
 The board's anti-encroachment squad has conducted several drives in the past year ever since pledging to weed out hawking "without any exception". "Police presence is necessary for such drives, but they remain busy for most of the time," a PCB official said.
 
  "It is time a permanent solution is found because our businesses are suffering,"  , chairman of the Pune Camp Merchants' Association, said.
