CHANDIGARH: Former MLA Nafe  , on Saturday, accused the Haryana government of patronising the land mafia and claimed to have ignored illegal occupation and sale of land worth Rs 100 crore by a nominated councillor of Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district.

 According to Rathi, the land, which is on the prime location of  , belongs to the civic body and public works (buildings and roads) department. He alleged nominated councillor Ashok Gupta forcefully occupied and sold it.
 
 “This incident exposes the truth behind zero tolerance for corruption as claimed by the Haryana chief minister and BJP leaders. I exposed this a fortnight ago. Instead of initiating a probe, the government got a case of threatening registered against me on the complaint of Gupta, the man behind the scam,” Rathi said in Chandigarh on Saturday.
 
 Rathi said Gupta had been nursing a grudge against him since 1991, when he got him unseated as   president. “Since this is public property, nobody could dare speak against him, therefore, we raised the issue,” he said.
 
 On March 4, former   was booked in a case of intimidation at   police station. Jhajjar SP B Sathish Balan is monitoring investigations.
 
 When contacted, Gupta dismissed the allegations. “The said land belongs to us and we have provided records to the district administration. Rathi was interested in purchasing this land. As we refused, he resorted to such acts. Since he threatened me, he has been booked in the case,” said Gupta.
 
 Rathi served as MLA twice from Bahadurgarh. He also headed the civic body in 1991. “What stopped him from raising this issue earlier?” asked Gupta.
