PUNE: College of Engineering Pune ( ) has been denied the deemed-to-be-university status by the ministry of human resource development. However, college authorities said it is a misinterpretation and they have sent an appeal for a review.

 The ministry’s letter on February 22, 2018 says, “CoEP neither fulfills eligibility conditions of UGC regulations 2010 nor 2016. Therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 3 of the UGC Act 1956, the application for conferment of Deemed to be   status to the CoEP has been rejected.”
 
 CoEP’s director   said, “We have been denied the status on the grounds that we don’t have a UGC granted centre with potential of excellence with a grant of Rs 1.5 core yet. However, we have two centres with potential of excellence granted HRD ministry with a Rs 5 crore funding from World Bank. Hence, this is a matter of misinterpretation. We have written to the ministry stating that we have the centres.”
