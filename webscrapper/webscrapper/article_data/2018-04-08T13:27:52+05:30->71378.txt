VADODARA: It might have been a representation to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) that triggered action against beleaguered Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd (DPIL). The CBI had conducted raids at the office of the company and the residences of its promoters on Thursday after registering an offence.

 The accused promoters – founder   and his sons managing director Amit Bhatnagar and joint managing director Sumit Bhatnagar – had allegedly cheated a consortium of 11 banks of Rs 2,654 crore. DPIL was extended advances despite it figuring on the defaulters list of the Reserve Bank of India and the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) caution list. The CBI is also looking into the possibility of connivance of bank officials in the fraud.
 
 Sources said that last month itself an aggrieved person had made representations to the PMO regarding the affairs of DPIL. It is believed that this may have set the ball rolling for investigations against the company and its promoters eventually leading to registration of an offence by the CBI. The offence by the CBI too mentions ‘source information’ leading to the offence.
