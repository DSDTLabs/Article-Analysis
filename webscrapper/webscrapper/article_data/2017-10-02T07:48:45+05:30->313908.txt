CHENNAI: After facing flak from Sivaji Ganesan’s family members including son Prabhu — whose remarks reflected a disheartened community of actors — and from angry fans over the previous week, the government on Sunday went out of its way to ease over the differences at the inauguration of the memorial to the legendary leading man.

 The government, which earlier announced that ministers D Jayakumar and Kadambur C Raju would open the memorial, not only acceded to demands that the chief minister or the deputy chief minister inaugurate the memorial but also lightened the mood with recollections of the late actor and Jayakumar even broke into song.
 
 The minister, who faced fire from Sivaji fans for his remark that the crowd-puller could not even become an MLA, said, "When I was speaker, I was able to conduct assembly sessions rapidly because I learned how to be articulate from watching   perform."
 
 Jayakumar then crooned love songs from Sivaji’s hits and recited a line from a tragic scene, leading deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam to describe the minister as a "great comic actor".
 
 After Panneerselvam, with Sivaji’s son by his side, opened the memorial on what would have been the actor’s 89th birthday, Prabhu made a request on behalf of the film industry.
 
 "Members of all parties love Sivaji Ganesan the same. At a time when the MGR centenary celebrations are in progress, we are standing at a memorial which was Amma’s [Jayalalithaa’s] dream. The memorial houses a statue that was erected by Kalaingar [Karunanidhi]," Prabhu said, asking the state information ministry to include the DMK leader’s name and contribution to the memorial.
 
 Panneerselvam said the government would soon hold the state film awards for movies between 2009 and 2014.
