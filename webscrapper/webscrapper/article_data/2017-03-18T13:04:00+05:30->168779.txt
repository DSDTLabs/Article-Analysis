BHOPAL: The state government has found in the Dalai Lama a new source of inspiration to promote its much-hyped ‘happiness department’ — a brainchild of CM   and the only one in the country. 

 The event is being organized at the assembly on March 19, where the Dalai Lama will speak to a select audience and discuss initiatives by the state government to measure gross happiness index of the people. The spiritual leader will advise legislators and bureaucrats on “how to live a happy life”. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Speaker Sitasaran Sharma will also express their views.
 
 Dalai Lama, who is also the patron of Action for Happiness — a movement of people committed to building a happier and more caring society — launched a new course in London in September 2015 to help people discover how to live a happier and kinder life. The MP government hopes to draw lessons from it. The happiness department started on March 31, 2016, but doesn’t have much to show on the ground. It was not even mentioned in this year’s state Budget speech. 
 
 “We have been following Buddhist philosophy to live a peaceful and happier life and His Holiness the Dalai Lama is one of the promoters of peace despite having so many ups and downs in life and struggling silently for the peaceful Tibetan society. His initiatives to live happily in a kinder society are inspirational,” said Manoj Shrivastava, principal secretary of culture department, the organizer of the lecture. 
 
 “The Dalai Lama says we must put the happiness of others at the centre of our lives. This is the path to lasting peace and happiness. And this is the philosophy of the happiness department,” said an official.
 
 A calendar on ‘Anand Sansthan’ (happiness department) will be released on the occasion. The same day, the spiritual leader is likely to participate in Narmada Sewa Yatra, the state government’s initiative to save water and conserve the river.
