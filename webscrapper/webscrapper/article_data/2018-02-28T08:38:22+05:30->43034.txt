MANALI: Residents of remote Shill village of Kullu risked their lives to protect 100 houses after fire broke out in a house that spread to other houses in no time on Tuesday morning.

 The fire destroyed three houses completely and partially damaged some other houses. Nearly a dozen animals were killed in the incident.
 
 At 10.40am, residents of the thickly populated village on a hilltop first noticed flames and smoke coming out of a house. People started running for their life and even could not protect their cattle as the fire spread very fast in traditional wooden houses.
 
 Realising that fire services cannot reach the village in the absence of road, residents picked up buckets and utensils and started spraying water on the fire. Some even climbed on the roofs to spray water. They used horticulture spray pumps and removed inflammable materials from nearby houses to check the flames. If timely action was not taken, the entire village would have been reduced to ashes, leaving nearly 300 families homeless.
 
 Eight families in total were left without a roof.
 
 Kullu tehsildar   said while they were assessing the damages, the affected families have been provided Rs 10,000 per family as immediate relief. “The victims are being given ration and blankets,” he said.
 
 Prakash, a resident, said the village is not connected by road and it was due to tireless efforts of villagers that they could control the fire. “People from nearby villages also rushed for our help. It was probably the most devastating fire incident of the state this year. Fortunately, there was no loss of life,” he said.
 
 On Monday, a house in   village of Kullu was destroyed in fire, killing six sheep. on Friday, eight houses in Dageni village of Anni sub-division of Kullu were destroyed in forest fire in which two cattle were burnt alive.
