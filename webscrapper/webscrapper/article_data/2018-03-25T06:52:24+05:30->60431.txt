MUMBAI: The state government wants to regulate pet shops that sell exotic birds, animals and fish in municipal markets here. 

 
  
  
 The government on Friday tabled a bill seeking an amendment to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, making it mandatory for the shops to get aspecific licence which allows the sale and trade of exotic fish, birds and animals, barring those protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. 
 
 Currently, these shops work on basic licences issued by the market department, and there is no specific rules for their functioning. 
 
 The bill, if cleared, will pave the way for their regulation. The government will amend section 398 of MMC Act to modify the schedule on permissible items that can be sold in municipal markets to include these exotic animals and birds, said senior officials. 
 
 There are 92 municipal markets in the city and big markets like   have a separate section from where these birds and animals can be purchased. 
 
 Bombay high court had in April 2017 directed   and police to stop the illegal sale of animals and birds in pet shops at Crawford Market. 
 
 The bench, in its order, said the authorities were not serious and were doing nothing to see the unlawful sale of animals is stopped at Crawford Market. 
 
 It directed the ward officer (markets) and senior inspector of MRA Marg police station to keep a strict vigil to enforce and eradicate the illegal sale. It added that these officers will be held responsible, and if the sale is not stopped, the court will take action against them.
