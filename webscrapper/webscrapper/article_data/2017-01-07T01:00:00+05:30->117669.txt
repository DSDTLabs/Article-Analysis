Showcasing singers from across the globe,   promises to be a powerhouse of entertainment. Vivo Camera & Music presents 'Dil Hai Hindustani' launches on Star Plus today at 8 pm. While the show upholds the global popularity of Hindi music, its uniqueness lies in the diversity of participants, who come from different nationalities. For the first time, a singing reality show will see solos, duos and groups (choir, band, acapella) competing on the same platform. It also boasts of a power-packed panel of judges — Karan Johar, Shekhar Ravjiani, Shalmali Kholgade and   —who have put India on the global map of music and entertainment.
Impressed with the opportunity this platform offers to its participants, singer   says, “Dil Hai Hindustani is redefining music reality shows on Indian television by introducing a wide array of singers from not only India, but even abroad. What amazed me most is the fact that even participants who don’t know the language would be singing Hindi film music. I’m elated to see the passion with which Hindi songs are being performed across the globe. This will take music reality shows to another level. My best wishes to the judges and the team for celebrating Hindi film music in such a wonderful way.”
