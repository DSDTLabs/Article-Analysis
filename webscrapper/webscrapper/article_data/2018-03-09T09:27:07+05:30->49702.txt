AMARAWATI: The Andhra Pradesh government tabled its 2018-19 budget with a total outlay of 1,91,063.61 crore, projecting a revenue surplus of 5,235.24 crore. This surplus is against the revenue deficit projected at 4,018 crore the pre-vious year. 

 Presenting the budget for the second consecutive year in the new capital,  , on Thursday, finance minister   said the state was at a crossroads of development and deficit. He attributed the deficit to the increasing indifference of the central government in extending the entitlements due for the state as per the   Reorganisation Act, 2014. 
 
 He also pointed out that the central government has failed to fulfil the promises made to the state at the time of bifurcation.The finance minister said that four years are not enough to rebuild the state, which lost its basic economic foundations, such as the capital city and buoyant service sector. The situation has been further compounded by lack of support from the central government.
 
 While continuing to fight for support from the Centre, the state has achieved a double digit growth for the past three years, averaging 10.96% against the 7.31% national rate, said the finance minister. This success, he claimed, was possible due to efficient resource mobilisation, effective management of available resources, and instilling a sense of accountability and transparency in the government. “Our hard work, coupled with inherent advantages provided by the entrepreneurial skills of the people, has catapulted us to this position of strong belief in our capabilities, and convert every crisis into an opportunity,” Ramakrishnudusaid.
 
 He also said the annual budget will meet the welfare initiatives of the government. He offered welfare measures to all sections ‘to establish an equal, vibrant and unified society’.
