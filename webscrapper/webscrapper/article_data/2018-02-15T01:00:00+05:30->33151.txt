Fighting societal norms and hoping to give kinnars a life of dignity, the TV show ' ', which airs from Monday to Friday at 8 pm on Colors, has been engaging viewers with a gripping narrative.   ( ) and Harman’s ( ) love story has witnessed several ups and downs, but it’s their belief that once bound by love, two people are meant to be together for the next seven lives.

 However, the story has reached a point where Saumya’s love for   will be tested after she decides to participate in the Aravan Puja. Having accepted Saumya the way she is —she is a transgender — Harman is against this puja that highlights old traditions of the kinnar community. According to the rituals, Saumya will be dressed as a bride and will be seen draping a rich, red Banarasi sari — inspired by the ensemble worn by India’s most-talked about bride last year, Anushka Sharma. Rubina elaborates, “Symbolic of a marriage to the Aravan God, the puja is a landmark ritual for the kinnar community, where they pray to be born as women in their next births. Saumya wants her relationship with Harman to last till eternity, but little does she know that this puja will threaten the love and respect that he has for her.”
 
 Unfortunately for her, Harman watches her going through the ritual and storms out in a fit of rage. Saumya’s prayer for a happily ever after eventually ends up shaking the very foundation of their relationship and separates the duo.
