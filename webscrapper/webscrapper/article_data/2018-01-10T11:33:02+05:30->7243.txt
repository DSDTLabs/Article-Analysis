 It may be recalled that East Coast Energy's efforts to set up a 2,600 MW thermal plant at Kakarapalli in Srikakulam had met with stiff resistance from locals. Later in 204, the TDP regime had declared there is no need for thermal plants as AP has surplus power.
 
 A bench of Rajeswara Rao Vithanala and   will soon take up the pleas in the tribunal.
