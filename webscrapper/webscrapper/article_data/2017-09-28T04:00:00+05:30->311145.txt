Surat: Chairman of Airports Authority of India (AAI) Guruprasad Mohapatra has said that the process for customs notified status of Surat airport is moving as per the defined schedule.

 Talking to TOI over phone from Delhi, Mohapatra said, “Things are in order as per schedule. Various departments are coordinating and we expect the customs notified status for Surat airport to be completed soon.” 
 
 Mohapatra added, “The runway repairs and other infrastructural facilities will be completed within next fortnight. Once the staff for customs operations is appointed, international operations will begin.” 
 
 Sources in AAI said customs notification is likely to be issued before the end of 2017. On the other hand, the Air India Express, which has proposed to launch Surat-Dubai flight operation, is likely to start the online booking after October 15. 
 
 It’s almost 10 months ever since AAI proposed Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) to approve customs notified status. The AAI had sent the customs notified proposal for Surat airport in November-2016.
 
 Navsari MP C R Paatil, who is coordinating the airport issues with the central government, said, “The state government is to provide immigration staff for Surat airport. I will be meeting chief minister Vijay Rupani to discuss the issue before the model code of conduct is imposed.” 
 
 At present, Surat airport has only domestic connectivity to Mumbai, Kolkata, Patna, Goa, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Delhi. According to data, during the year 2015-16, about 4 lakh passengers from Surat travelled to international destinations through Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports.
