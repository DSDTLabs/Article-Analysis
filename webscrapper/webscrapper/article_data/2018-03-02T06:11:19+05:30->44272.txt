HYDERABAD: The festival of colours may have brought a welcome break from the routine for many in the twin cities, but ongoing examinations, including the board exams for class 10 and class 12 have played a spoilsport for several students who will miss out on   celebrations. 

 With SSC and HSC examinations being conducted in February and March, exam dates clash with Holi every year. This year, SSC exams commenced on Thursday, and   board exams begin on March 5, putting a damper on Holi celebrations for the kids. Many expressed displeasure at missing out on the fun. Some took to social media to requested Prime Minister   to look into it.
 
 A class 12th student   (@Gopalgupta007) tweeted: "I live in Hyderabad, Telangana. I am a student of class 12, we have our exam on 2nd of March, on the day of Holi. But as holi over here is on the 1st, the govt has given us prerparation holiday. Even last year I could not celebrate Holi. Please look @narendramodi (Sic)"
 
 March is the month of final exams for all other classes as well. Students of other classes bemoaned havving to face the same issue. "Every year we play Holi with wet colours. But since I have my science exam two days after Holi, my mother has strictly said no to wet colours. Even if I am allowed to play Holi with gulal, what is the fun without water gun fights," said Aum Mehta, a class 3 student.
 
 Even parents are on the fence when it comes to letting their wards kids play Holi with wet colours. "Even if we stop our children from celebrating Holi, they still won't be able to concentrate in their studies. But with exams on, we can't take the risk of allowing them to play with colours," said  , mother of a class 5th student Aum.
