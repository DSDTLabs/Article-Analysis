SHIMLA:   finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Tuesday said Himachal Pradesh would not be denied its just   from all   ( ) projects.

 He said Punjab would sit together with Himachal Pradesh to resolve the issue as per the directions of the Supreme Court.
 
 Badal said that issue of BBMB projects was discussed before Union home minister Rajnath Singh during the   (NZC) meeting in Chandigarh where it was decided that states concerned should sit together to resolve the matter.
 
 While a large number of people were forced to leave their homes and fertile lands, the state till date has not been able to get its due share despite the directions of SC.
 
 During the NZC meeting, Himachal Pradesh government had demanded from the Union government to provide 7.19% power in all BBMB projects in the ratio of its population.
 
 HP had also demanded from the Centre to calculate arrear claims against Punjab and Haryana as per the inter-state energy settlement rate.
 
 Raising the issue during the NZC meeting, HP revenue minister Kaul Singh Thakur had said in pursuant of Supreme Court judgment, the calculation of arrear claims against Punjab and Haryana should have been calculated as per inter-state energy settlement rate vis-Ã -vis Badarpur Thermal Power Station and not as per National Fertilizers Limited rates.
 
 He had requested Rajnath Singh, who is also the chairman of the Northern Zonal Council, to convene a meeting with the Union minister of power and the chief ministers of states concerned so that Himachal Pradesh could get its legitimate share as endorsed by the Supreme Court without any further delay.
