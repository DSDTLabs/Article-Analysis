Weeks after actors   and   declared their entry into politics, DMK leader Karunanidhi’s grandson and actor,  , has joined the bandwagon. Throwing criticism of dynastic politics to the wind, Udayanidhi, in an interview to TOI,said he was always in politics, and now he is turning active. “Movie commitments had kept me busy for long,” he told   freewheeling chat.

 While the appointment of   as   managing editor eight years ago was the first indication of his political inclination, the actor hogged political limelight during the 75th anniversary of Murasoli last year.
 
 He told TOI that he had the blessings of his grandfather and father. “I am not after any party post. I am there to support my father. The moment he became working president, there were rumours that I would succeed him as the party youth wing secretary. We never even thought about it,” he said.
