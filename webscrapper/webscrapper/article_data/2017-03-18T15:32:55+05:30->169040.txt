NAGPUR: High Court on Friday sought details from the government on how punishment would be meted out to controversial lawyer  , as he failed to surrender and also to pay the cost imposed on him.

 The specially constituted division bench comprising justice   and justice   asked assistant public prosecutor   to come out with legal provisions where accused could be punished, like under Advocates Act. The judges stated that it would be unnecessary to use police machinery to trace the lawyer. Even   (BCI) could be asked to cancel his lawyer’s permit.
 
 As Uke failed to deposit Rs4.12 lakh before Thursday, his 2-month jail term, kept in abeyance during last hearing, was restored. Out of this amount, he was asked to furnish surety of Rs2 lakh and another surety in same amount from the third person, both through cheques, to be deposited with the court registry.
 
 Uke achieved a dubious distinction of becoming first lawyer in the city’s history to be convicted for the Contempt of Court’s Act.
