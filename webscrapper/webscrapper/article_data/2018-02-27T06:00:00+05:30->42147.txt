Kolkata: Reputable brands of packaged water are being faked and sold at stores close to hospitals and market places, it was revealed during a meeting between MMiC Atin Ghosh and the general manager of a prominent packaged drinking water company on Monday. Officials of a state-owned water company also conceded that the product was being faked widely.

 In Monday’s meeting, the official expressed his inability to take action against some local firms engaged in faking the original brand. “We don’t have the infrastructure to prevent it. But we have registered complaints with the state police and food safety commissioner,” the official told Ghosh, who is charge of the civic health department.
 
 In at least three water samples — collected last week — of different brands, tests confirmed presence of coliform bacteria. “Now we need to take samples from two factories that are owned by the brand whose representative met me today,” Ghosh said.
 
 “We need to form a team with multiple agencies to launch a special drive against these fake companies,” Ghosh added. The mayor will meet a team of senior officials from state police next week and chalk out a plan.
