NEW DELHI: Senior advocate Ram   approached the   on Thursday challenging the   governor’s decision to invite   to form the government, saying it was a “gross and blatant abuse” of constitutional power.

 
 He requested a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y   to allow him to intervene in the case in a personal capacity. The court asked him to mention his plea before the bench that will hear the case on Friday. “[The governor] has brought disrepute to the constitutional office he is holding,” Jethmalani, 94, said. He had announced his retirement last September year after a seven-decade career.
