  (PMC) has informed us that they have increased the number of dustbins in the city and roads are being broomed thrice a day. There is a check on the entry of trucks in the city. Besides, we are also assessing the possibility of introducing CNG for vehicles plying on Patna roads.
 
 
 
 
 We have already held the first round of meeting with oil companies to deliberate on various aspects of introducing CNG in Patna. We are in talks with GAIL as they are presently laying a CNG pipeline network, which is passing through Bihar. They have assured us to provide the pipeline connectivity to Patna by the end of this year.
 
 
 
 
 The state transport commissioner has assured us to get all such vehicles removed soon. The transport department is to issue a notification in this regard soon. Registration of diesel autorickshaws has already been stopped in Patna. 
 
 
 
 
 Water quality of the Ganga is tested every month and corresponding reports are sent to central and state governments. Besides, we have asked agencies concerned to ensure that untreated sewage is not discharged into the river. Road construction department has informed us that a new drainage channel is being constructed under the   along the river, in which untreated sewage would be discharged and taken to sewage treatment plants in south Patna.
 
 
 
 
 We are going to install two ‘continuous automatic ambient air quality station’ with LCD screen display at IGIMS and Rajdhani Vatika respectively. These monitoring stations would give details on the prevailing level of air quality on LCD display panels similar to the one at the planetarium.
