LUCKNOW: As in the 2016   survey, Lucknow missed the chance of better   this year too because of poor participation from its residents. Out of 28 lakh population, only 3,792 citizens participated and most of them were found dissatisfied with sanitation practices in Lucknow. Almost 50% of participating population didn’t find much progress made in sanitation and cleanliness compared to last year. 

 Most respondents gave thumbs-down in parameters like availability of dustbins, accessibility to public toilets and coverage of maximum houses under door-to-door waste collection. They didn’t find much progress in these practices compared to last year. As a result, Lucknow got a poor 214 marks out of 600 score for citizen feedback. 
 
 The worst performing area was open defecation and LMC’s inability to build more public and individual toilets. Here, Lucknow scored only 30 out of 270 marks. The team concluded that   failed to achieve 90% target for constructing public/individual toilets. 
 
 In on-site observation, Lucknow scored just 40% of the 500 marks. The inspection team didn’t find optimum cleanliness around railway station and main bus station of city. Also, more than 75% commercial areas were found unclean. The team also concluded that majority of public toilets in the city had no electricity, water supply or proper ventilation and were also not sensitive to needs of women, children and the disabled.
