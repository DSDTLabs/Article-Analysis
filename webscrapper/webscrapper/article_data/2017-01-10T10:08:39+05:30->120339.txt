JAIPUR: The Indian cricket board's CEO,  , has written to all state associations on Monday, asking them to submit a list of 'new' office bearers at the earliest.

 Johri has made it clear that the desired list has to be one after January 3 Â­ the day the  's verdict rendered all officials, who do not meet the  's criteria, disqualified.
 
 In his email, Johri has stressed that he is asking for the information as per directions from the Lodha Committee.
 
 Clearly, the committee wants to ensure that the ineligible candidates have no role to play in the activities of the  . The mail to Johri from the committee came after several disqualified officials held an informal meeting in Bengaluru on Saturday to discuss the future course of action. Perhaps anticipating that these officials are trying to find a way around the SC order, the Lodha Committee is keen to nip any such move in the bud.
 
 Several officials of the state cricket bodies have already resigned, but there are many who are still holding on to their positions. These officials stand to be charged with contempt of court.
