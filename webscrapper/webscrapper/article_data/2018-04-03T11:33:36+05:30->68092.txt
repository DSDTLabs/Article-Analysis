MYSURU: It is impossible to do good to society if one doesn’t show inclination to work, said retired police officer A K   during Police Flag Day celebrations at   grounds here on Monday. 

 A constable has to go an extra mile in work to earn reputation in the department. He or she has to collect intelligence and then pass on the same to their immediate seniors that could help in controlling crimes and ensure law and order in society, Suresh said, adding: “Discipline, commitment and being loyal to seniors alone won’t help one earn a name.” 
 
 Suresh, who retired after 36 years of service in 2017, claimed all police personnel — in his view — are good, but due to certain reasons, they may end up doing wrong. “In such situations, the onus is on station house officers to correct them. All senior officers must have compassion towards their subordinates,” he said.
 
 Finding solution to various challenges in work would not be a difficult task if all the working staff work in goodwill. “I’m the good example because I have been successful in practising it,” Suresh stated.
 
 On the occasion, police commissioner A   dealt with two issues: office space for retired police officers’ association and deficit account balance of the association. “Last year, I had promised to provide office space at the old commissioner’s office building. But it got delayed.” 
 
 Southern police range chief Soumendu Mukherjee, KPA director  , SP Amith Singh and DCP (law and order) N Vishnuvardhana were present.
 
 On the occasion, the following 13 retired police officers were felicitated: S J Nanjundaiah, Puttamada Nayaka, C M Linganna, Ranganath, Shylajamma, Linganna, Syed Sirajuddin, N Basavaraju, John Vincent, T M Shankar, K P Parashiva, Thammanna Ramegowda and S Basbappa.
