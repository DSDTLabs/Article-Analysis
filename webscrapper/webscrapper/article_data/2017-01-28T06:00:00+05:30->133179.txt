Visakhapatnam: Amaravati will emerge as one of the five best cities in the world, said chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. Speaking at the Partnership Summit here, he presented irresistible investment opportunities to 5,000-odd delegates attending the summit. “We want to build a world class capital city which is an exciting investment opportunity for engineering, construction and design companies across the world. We have already roped in foreign consultancy agencies to give their plans. We have abundant bauxite, barytes, beach sand and limestone reserves and a vast coast line to explore. The state is the best state to do business and the Union government has promised us its complete cooperation,” narrated Naidu.

 With robust growth in agriculture and allied sectors and a vibrant service sector, Naidu hoped that the state will register a 15 per cent annual growth in the next two years. He said the demonetisation drive has cleaned the economy and the system is ready to move at a maximum pace. He maintained that Aadhaar-based transactions will further boost the economy and was confident that inter-operable bank transactions will increase the tax base.
 
 He pointed out that his land pooling initiative has attracted international attention as the innovative programme resulted in pooling of 35,000 acres of land from farmers without any problem. “This did not happen in any democratic country anywhere in the world. Farmers agreed to part with their land as our proposal was a win-win situation for both the government and the land owners,” pointed Naidu.
