TRICHY: Farmers across delta districts have appealed to the state government to do the needful to get the due share of water to save 25 lakh acre samba paddy standing crop, as the present water level of the   reservoir stands at only 63 feet. As the neighbouring state has to release 63 tmc of water in  , the   chief minister should talk to the chief minister of  , functionaries of farmers association urged.

 Since the entire delta districts need water for 60 more days for the samba paddy crop to mature, the available 63-foot water would never be sufficient, said the state organiser of the farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress, Puliyur A Nagarajan.
 
 The water level at the Mettur reservoir has been fast decreasing, as the quantum of water to be released was increased to 10,000 cusecs until January 6. Though the quantum of water released from the reservoir has been minimised to 2,500 cusecs from Sunday morning, the available water could be used only for 30 more days, he said. However, the standing crop should be watered at least for 60 days. So, the chief minister should take necessary steps to get due share of water from the neighbouring state.
 
 “The Karnataka government should have released 63 tmc of water on Cauvery until November 30, 2017. However, that much quantum of water was not realised so far. So, the chief minister should immediately meet the Karnataka chief minister and should pressurize him to release the required share of water for the benefits of delta farmers,” he appealed.
