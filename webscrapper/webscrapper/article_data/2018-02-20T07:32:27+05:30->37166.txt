NEW DELHI: Seeking modification of an 11-year-old judgment on police reforms, the   told the   on Monday that states were misusing the SC direction to give two-year tenures to directors general of police and were appointing officers nearing retirement to the posts to give them two additional years in service.

 The SC, in its 2006 judgment in   case, had ordered the Centre and states to implement reforms in the police structure, including fixed tenure to police chiefs and separation of investigating wing from those tasked with maintaining law and order. However, most states have not implemented the reforms as directed by the SC, leading to filing of three contempt petitions by Singh's counsel Prashant Bhushan.
 
 Attorney general K K Venugopal told a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud that the modus operandi adopted by states on the basis of the Prakash Singh judgment was interfering with the directive issued in another case relating to police reforms.
 
 Bhushan objected to it and said the other judgment in T S RSubramaniam's case did not deal with police reforms at all and that it was a ploy by the Centre to stall police reforms as the SC had already dismissed petitions seeking review of the 2006 judgment.
 
 The bench told the AG that if the SC had already dismissed the Centre's review petition, the court could not entertain a modification application. The AG said the court should consider directing states not to appoint officers on the verge of retirement as head of the police department to give them an additional two years.
 
 The SC postponed hearing on the matter to April 2.
