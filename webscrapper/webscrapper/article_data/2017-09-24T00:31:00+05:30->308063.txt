Ajmer: Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Saturday displayed rifles and weapons on platform No. 1 of Ajmer railway station on the occasion of RPF establishment week. The force also displayed their action plan at the time of emergency and disaster.

 In the morning, a parade and blood donation camp was held. RPF also spread awareness about their helpline.
 
 The main aim of the celebration week is to instil confidence in the passengers about the security in trains and at railway stations. 
 
 Divisional railway manager Puneet Chawla said that our main aim is to show that RPF is armed with latest weapons and ready to provide security to people. The force boasts of anti-bomb squad and bullet-proof jackets too. “I congratulate the force for working for the safety and security of railways and passengers,” said Chawla.
 
 Established on September 29, 1957, initially RPF had the status of an armed force. After an amendment act on September 20, 1985, the Railway Protection Force became a separate force. 
 
 RPF works for providing safety to railway passengers and security of railway property. RPF also checks smuggling of women and children in railway premises and develops coordination between local state police. It acts as a bridge between the railway authorities and local police.
