Actress   and   Chris Martin have been photographed together for the first time after their romance was confirmed last month.

 In exclusive photographs obtained by media, Johnson is seen enjoying a night out with the Martin, Coldplay frontman, in Malibu.
 
  
  
 The two celebrities arrived at restaurant Soho House in the 40-year-old musician's jeep, with Johnson covering her face in a bid to go unrecognized.
 
 According to source, the couple stayed for dinner for just under two hours before heading back to Martin's home together.
 During their outing, Martin wore a simple black sweater and rolled the sleeves up. He matched his top with a pair of black trousers, adding a pop of colour via the hot pink laces of his similarly black shoes. He also wrapped a massive pewter grey scarf round his neck.
 
 Johnson stuck largely to black as well by wearing a chic raven-toned coat complemented trousers and boots in the same shade. Her top, however, featured a gold and blue diamond pattern across a white field.
 
 The pair first sparked romance rumours back in October 2017 when they were seen enjoying a dinner date here. And in November, Johnson was photographed sitting with the crew as Coldplay performed a gig in  .
 
 After weeks of speculation, they finally confirmed their relationship as they were seen in Paris last month.
