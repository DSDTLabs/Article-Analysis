Ramanathapuram: Two Indian nationals hailing from Rameswaram were arrested by Sri Lankan navy in the countryâ€™s territorial waters on charges of smuggling heroin inside tobacco products (beedis). They were arrested east off Mannar Light House in Sri Lanka and navy seized 425 g of heroin from them.

 According to Sri Lankan navy website, a special boat squadron and group of naval personnel from North Central Naval Command apprehended two Indian nationals on Friday, sailing in a small country boat entering into the country, based on a tip off. Navy team recovered 425 g of heroin and a stock of tobacco products (beedis) from them. The apprehended Indian nationals along with heroin, fishing boat and tobacco products were handed over to Talaimannar police.
 
 The arrested nationals have been identified as Ganesh and Subramanian Nambu from Puthuroad in Rameswaram. They could be possibly Indian fishermen lured for quick bucks since affording so much of heroin is a costly affair for ordinary fishermen, sources said.
 
 Earlier 3 Indian fishermen were held by SL navy on charges of trespassing into their territorial waters. While inspecting the craft and arrested fishers, the navy personnel found 410 mg of heroin with them. They were handed over to Mannar police and prosecuted and lodged in Vavuniya prison.
