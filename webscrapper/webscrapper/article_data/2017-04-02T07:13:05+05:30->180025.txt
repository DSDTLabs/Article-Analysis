BENGALURU: The   government on Saturday told   that it cannot release additional Cauvery water. 

  A four-member TN delegation led by Shivadas Meena, principal secretary to the state's chief minister, met Karnataka chief secretary Subash Chandra Kunthia seeking an additional release of 3tmcft of water from Cauvery. Khuntia said: "We told TN there is not enough water to share in the current circumstances and only when it rains, we can consider it." 
 
  "While there were no discussions about river-sharing pact or SC directives, TN sought the release of additional 3tmcft on humanitarian grounds," said Khuntia.
