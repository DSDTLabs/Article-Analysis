NEW DELHI: A day after a   was   outside her house during a brawl with her relatives in Jagatpuri, police have recovered a   footage of the incident.

 
 The footage shows the woman, Farida, being dragged out of the house by her   Shamshad, who bangs her head against a rickshaw passing by. Shamshad then pushes her to the ground and kicks her on the chest and face. Another man is seen handing over a bamboo stick to the accused, who hits Farida with it on her head and face. 
 
 The injured woman is then helped by a girl — possibly her daughter — and manages to get up and walk. But witnesses said that she collapsed a few feet away and became unconscious. Farida’s husband, Haider Ali, later filed a police complaint saying that Shamshad, who lived in the same building, was involved in a dispute with him over a plot at their village in Bijnor.
 
 The family members told police an argument broke out between Haider and his two brothers over the ownership of the plot. The two brothers were against the division of property in Jagatpuri and Haider and constructing a temporary structure on the roof.
 
 Police teams were sent to arrest Haider’s brothers Musa and Shamshad. While Musa was arrested from his house, his four sons and Shamshad are absconding.
