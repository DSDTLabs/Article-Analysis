 On February 13, Matin bought a SIM card and Suraj created fake accounts on social media in the name of   and approached Mayur. Eight days before the incident, Suraj came to Nagpur and stayed at a lodge. He kept chatting with   and summoned Matin according to the plan. Later, the duo told Raj to bring his bike. Matin and Raj abducted Mayur from Sevasadan T-point in Civil Lines, added cops.
 
 Suraj, having past record in Chandrapur, used Mayur’s cell phone number to ask Ashok to bring money near VCA Square. The accused kept roaming in different parts of city and were caught in one of the CCTV cameras. Mayur somehow escaped and returned home from   within six hours.
 
 Suraj and Matin had fled to Mumbai post the failed abduction attempt. Cops traced their location through phone calls made from Mayur’s number and nabbed the accused.
