NEW DELHI: An incident uncannily similar to the Adarsh Nagar case was reported from   two and a half years ago. A 30-year-old man had died after allegedly jumped off the terrace of   police station on August 11, 2014.

 The four-storeyed Uttam Nagar police station has easy access to all. There are over a dozen rooms of investigating officers and complainants are not stopped from going on any of the floors.
 
 The man,   (30), had gone to the police station to register a complaint against a group of youths who had thrashed him over a dispute in their colony. His family had claimed that he was ill-treated by the policemen after which he jumped to his death.
 
 The case is yet to reach its logical conclusion and inquest proceeding are on. “The incident took place in full public view and no policemen were involved in the incident,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Nahrwal, who lived in   with his wife and two children, had requesting the cops to speed up the investigations. When the policemen asked them to wait a few minutes, he sneaked upstairs to the terrace and jumped down. He was rushed to   hospital with injuries on his head and chest. During questioning, his family said that he was depressed.
 
 A case under IPC Section 323 (causing hurt) was later registered against the men who have been accused of beating up Nahrwal.
