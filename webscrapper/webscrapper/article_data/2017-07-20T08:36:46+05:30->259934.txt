NAGPUR: The   ( ) has demanded some relaxation in the property and   amnesty scheme launched by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation.

 Over 30 representatives of the VPVP, Nagpur division, met mayor Nanda Jichkar on Wednesday and presented a memorandum demanding that if the   reduced penalties on the unpaid taxes, it would encourage more citizens to clear the dues.
 
 Mahmud Ansari, city president of VPVP, said, “At present, under the amnesty scheme the NMC is offering waiver of 90% penalty on property tax and 100% on water tax. The civic body should waive entire penalty being charged on unpaid property tax.” He also urged the mayor to defer the ‘Gandhigiri’ campaign, launched for the recovery of unpaid taxes, till August.
 
 Pratap Singh Chauhan said that the civic body should extend the last date for availing the amnesty scheme from the present August 8 to October or November. “Extending the deadline will help people from weaker sections with hand to mouth existence to arrange money to clear the dues,” Chauhan said.
 
 Usha Pandey said, “Though the amnesty scheme by the civic body is a welcome step, the mayor should review some of its conditions and offer sops to the citizens. The NMC should also consider allowing citizens to pay the dues in instalments.”
 
 Explaining the financial condition of the NMC, Jichkar pointed out that the present amnesty scheme is third one and still many people have not come forward to clear the tax dues. She also ruled out extending the last date for availing the amnesty offer.
