GURUGRAM: Residents of Sector 5 on Sunday filed a police complaint against the owner of a   vend that recently came up at Singha Chowk near the famous   Mata  . 

 The move comes two days after the residents had staged a protest outside the shop demanding its  . 
 
 “As per law, liquor can’t be sold near any temple. A minimum of 500m distance should be maintained between the liquor shop and a temple. But this liquor   is within 100m of the temple,” said a resident Dharamveer Singh.
 
 “We will keep staging protests till the liquor vend is shifted from the area. We will not allow liquor shops in residential areas. Cops are hand-in-gloves with these criminals. They aren’t understanding the seriousness of the matter,” said Parul Yadav, another resident of the area. 
 
 Colonel Oberoi, a legal activist, alleged, “The liquor vend owner claimed residents won’t be able to harm him or shift the shop as he had the backing of top officials in the excise department. He also boasts of having bribed people in the ministry.”
 
 Some residents also claimed there were already two liquor vends in the area, that were following the 500m rule, and a third shop was anyway unnecessary. 
 
 “I don’t understand the need of having a new liquor shop in the area. Presence of a liquor shop near the temple makes us feel uncomfortable, as we need to cross these drunkards to visit a place of worship. Our children too have to cross this shop to go to their schools. Cops must think about our safety and relocate this shop,” said a woman, requesting anonymity.
 
 “Though the setting up of liquor vends does not come under our department, we will support the residents if any law has been violated,” said an officer at the Sector 5 police station.
