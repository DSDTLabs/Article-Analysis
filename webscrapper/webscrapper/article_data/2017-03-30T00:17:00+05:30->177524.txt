Panaji: Even as the month of March nears its end, the supply of mangoes in the local market continues to be weak leading to exorbitant prices and a bleak business for vendors. Even though the people’s favourite mancurad has come down to Rs 500 per dozen, locals are evading the golden fruit as of now hoping that prices fall further down in April.

 “The alphonso and mancurad variety of mangoes are steadily entering the market, though not in high quantities. The rates are, therefore, still high. We, however, hope that more mangoes in these varieties flow in by mid-April so that the market stabilizes by then,” said fruit vendor Abid Kalaigar.
 
 Another vendor Nisar Ahmed Nandihaldi insisted that mangoes from other states are also on low supply. “The harvest season is yet to take off on full swing in neighbouring states. Their poor supply has consequently led to rates being high. This has made business tough. Besides, most customers insist on purchasing the smaller-sized mangoes since they’re more affordable than their bigger counterparts. It has, therefore, become difficult to push overall sale of mangoes,” he said.
 
 Others like Daddu Ranebennur also claimed that the sale is slow owing to the time of the year. “The month of March is exam season and also financial year-end. People are, perhaps, too busy to indulge in mangoes right away, but we expect sales to pick up by April,” he said.
 
 Consumers are shying away from picking up the fleshier   fruits. One such buyer, Sumant P Desai is opting to purchase smaller sizes until the rates drop further, “I have bought a dozen of small mancurad for Rs 500 for now; the big ones are very pricey,” he said. 
 
 “Rs 500 per dozen for small alphonso mangoes is an okay price, so I don’t mind spending a few bucks. Overall mango prices have yet to come down. I will buy more in quantity only then,” said Asha Gulati, from Porvorim.
