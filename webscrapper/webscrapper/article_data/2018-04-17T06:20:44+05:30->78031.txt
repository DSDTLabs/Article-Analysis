The Ahmedabad police suspect that the murdered 11-year-old girl could be from   and a victim of revenge killing. Police believe that migrants settled in Surat have a history of crimes related to old grudges.

 A senior police officer said that one of the DGPs in the state, who is from Odisha, speculated that the girl’s features suggested that she could be from his state. Police have also decided to carry out a massive door-to-door search with the girl’s pictures to identify her in the city.
