 Krishna was infatuated with his 33-year-old married neighbour, who hailed from Nepal, the officer said. “Her husband was a construction worker and the couple has three children. Whenever the woman visited the local grocery shops, Krishna used to follow her. On Friday night, the woman’s husband went out to buy vegetables and her children were playing in front the house. Making use of the opportunity, Krishna approached her on the pretext of searching rented houses in the area. When he asked her about the rent on her house, the woman asked him to check with the house owner, who was residing on the ground floor. He suddenly pounced on her and tried to rape her. When she tried to escape, Krishna attacked her with a razor. The woman, who suffered injuries on her face, managed to raise an alarm. Locals residents rushed to her rescue and detained the man. He was later handed over to the all woman police (central),” the officer added.
 
 Police have registered a case against Krishna under Sections 376 (rape) read with 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) and 324 of the Indian Penal Code.
