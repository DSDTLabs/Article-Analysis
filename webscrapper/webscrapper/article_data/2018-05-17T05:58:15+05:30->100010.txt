CHENNAI: The state, which has had reasons to smile every year after the Class XII board   results with the increasing pass percentage, has been relatively subdued this year when the percentage dipped for the first time since 2011. Of the 9.07 lakh students who appeared for the exams held between March 1 and April 6, 91.1% passed. While the students have performed well across districts, this is still a slight dip from last year's 92.1 pass percentage. 

 This, education experts say, is mainly due to a more standardised questionnaire cum evaluation and also because students were focusing more on competitive exams like NEET and JEE. "Parents seemed content with their kids getting a decent board exam score and encouraging them to focus more on national-level competitive exams," said educational consultant Moorthy Selvakumaran. 
 
 School education minister   admitted that some students found the question papers tough compared to previous years as the papers were framed to ensure they would handle entrance tests better in the future.
 
 
 
 
 Of the 6,754 higher secondary schools, 1,907 schools including 238 government ones registered 100% pass. Continuing the usual trend, girls outperformed boys with 94.1 pass percentage against 87.7% of boys. 
 
 Top performing districts were Virudhunagar with 97% followed by Erode (96.3%) and Tirupur (96.1%). Least performing were Villupuram (83.35%), Ariyalur (85.38%) and Tiruvarur (85.49%). The minister warned schools against advertising about toppers. More than 40% students secured 700 marks and below while just 231 students scored 1,180 and above. The number of students who appeared for the exams also dropped from 9.33 lakh last year to 9.07 lakh this year. 
 
 M J Martin Kennedy, president of TN Private Schools Associations, opined that the lack of blueprint might be the reason for the dip in pass percentage. " Also, questions were asked from inside lessons and needed students to apply concepts learnt."
