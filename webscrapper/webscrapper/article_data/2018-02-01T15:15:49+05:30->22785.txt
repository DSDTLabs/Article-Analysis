THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The district’s first KIIFB project – construction of a   at   – is running into troubles due to opposition from local residents.

 When PWD initiated works by demolishing walls near  , a group of local residents protested. They alleged that they were kept in the dark over land acquisition and offered no money as compensation for demolition of the walls.
 
 The PWD is planning a ring road to solve the issue of   congestion in the Venjaramoodu Junction. The Rs 32 crore ring road will include the stretch from Pirappancode that joins MC Road at Ambalamukku and Attingal-Venjaramoodu stretch which will join MC Road near Venjaramoodu police station.
 
 On Wednesday when contractor of the project began to demolish walls on the road side, people disrupted the work. Sudhakaran Nair, a local resident at   near Pirappancode, said that he was no informed about demolition of his wall. “We are not against giving our land for development. But we should be informed. Also we must be given money for construction of a new wall,” he said.
 
 The local people approached Venjaramoodu police with a complaint. The police, however, said that they have not registered the complaint.
 
 Sources in PWD said that they began work after majority of people agreed to hand over land free of cost. “People are fed with up the congestion in Venjaramoodu Junction. With the development of ring road, these areas will develop and land value will increase. So, most people agreed to surrender their land free of cost. However, like any other development project, there are some people who oppose it,” said an official of PWD, adding that they have not earmarked money as compensation for walls.
 
 Sudhakaran Nair said they had filed a complaint with judicial first class magistrate court,   against acquisition. 
 
 D K Murali MLA said that the project was started after forming a people’s committee to discuss the land acquisition work. “Almost 90% of people agreed to co-operate,” he said.
