AMRITSAR: Farmers and fruits and vegetable dealers here have urged the state government to come to their rescue and take up the issue of export of vegetables to neighbouring Pakistan via Attari border after using diplomatic channels.

 “There is a glut of vegetables here these days and farmers are ploughing vegetables in the fields, whereas in stark contrast there is a huge demand of vegetables just 30 km away in Pakistan,” said Fruit and   Association secretary Jaspal Singh Sethi while talking to TOI on Thursday. He said for the past some time there had been almost no export of vegetables to Pakistan via Attari.
 
 “In the wholesale market here, potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower, onion are being sold for Rs 2, Rs 11, Rs 4 and Rs 8 per kg. However, in retail markets all vegetables are sold in the range of Rs 10-Rs 20 per kg,” he maintained.
 
 Sethi said farmers’ worst period started during demonetization when there was no cash flow in the market and they were forced to sell their produce at any price. “Hoping to get the best price as had happened in the past year, farmers had brought a large portion of their fields under vegetable cultivation and also got bumper crop, but demonetization played the spoilsport. Now, with the glut of crops, the only hope now is to export vegetables to Pakistan, which is struggling with their supply,” said president of association Ravinder Singh.
 
 Jamhuri Kisan Sabha president Satnam Singh Ajnala blamed the government for not fixing   for vegetables and its inability to set up vegetable-based agro industries in Punjab. “Since there is no MSP, farmers are being exploited by commission agents and the government is not doing anything,” he said, adding that the MSP of vegetables would at least ensure that farmers wouldn’t be at loss. Besides, he opined that the government should have a dependable transportation network to immediately supply vegetables where there was a deficit.
