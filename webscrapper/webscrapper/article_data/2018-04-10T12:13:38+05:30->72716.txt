UDHAGAMANDALAM:  ,000 people from across Gudalur constituency took part in a rally demanding patta (revenue record required to prove legal ownership over a plot) for the forest dwellers in Gudalur and Pandalur taluks in Nilgiri district on Monday.

 The forest dwellers have been demanding patta over three decades, Tamil   committee president  , who led the rally, said. “The government should immediately come forward to resolve the complexity of janmam land act and help the forest dwellers,” he said while speaking at a public meeting later. The government should also take proper measures to curtail man-animal conflict in Gudalur and Pandalur areas, he demanded.
 
 Earlier, Thirunavukarasu and other   functionaries observed a fast as part of a nation-wide protest called by Congress against the amendment made in the SC/ST act.
 
 In May 2014, bringing to an end one of the longest-fought legal wars in the high court that lasted over two decades, a division bench cancelled ‘patta’ given on the basis of specious documents and upheld denial of ‘patta’ for others, including planters, encroachers and corporate houses in janmam lands in Gudalur region. The case involved a large number of individuals and companies, including the   group, enjoying over 20,000 acres of land, demanding ‘ryotwari patta’ claiming that the lands were being cultivated by their predecessors and they were in continuous possession since purchase. Subsequently, they approached the   challenging the HC verdict. The case is still pending.
