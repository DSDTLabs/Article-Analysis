Actor Rosie O'Donnell's ex-wife   has passes away of apparent suicide at her home. She was 46. 

 Michelle, who tied the knot with O'Donnell in 2012 before splitting up two years later, was found passed away at her home on September 11.
 
 "I am saddened to hear about this terrible tragedy. Mental illness is a very serious issue affecting many families. My thoughts and prayers go out to Michelle's family, her wife and their child," 55-year-old O'Donnell, who shares four-year-old daughter   with Rounds, said. 
 
 O'Donnell also took to Twitter to retweet a fan who expressed condolence and shared a suicide prevention hotline number, "lovelovelove to @Rosie. If this is triggering anyone, I hope they'll contact the suicide prevention hotline 1-800- 273-8255." 
 
 O'Donnell filed for divorce from   in 2015 and their union was dissolved last year after they spent 15 months working out a settlement. 
 
 And last year, O'Donnell confirmed that she had sole custody of Dakota.
