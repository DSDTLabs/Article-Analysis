LUCKNOW: The ruling   is now working on giving active role to the 1.85 lakh new members it had enrolled in UP before   in 2014. Though the party has reached out already to at least 80 lakh through various programmes, a big section has yet to be activated. 

 Meanwhile, a new   drive started on Wednesday as part of the state-wide fortnight-long   and party workers have been told to not only induct new members but also re-connect with the existing ones.
 
 “The party has deputed 16,000 short-term ‘Vistaraks’ who are trained in party’s ideology and each of them has to bring in at least 50 new members daily,” said party spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi. The party has launched a new toll-free number and anyone giving missed call on it will become party member. There would be a confirmation SMS reaching the caller’s mobile phone assigning an enrolment number. 
 
 “The programme has a near-future motive of increasing the party’s base ahead of local body elections while making it stronger before 2019,” said UP BJP vice president and in charge of local body elections, JPS Rathore. 
 
 The new members will be given party flags and stickers. “The party connect will be reinforced through subsequent efforts,” said BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak.
