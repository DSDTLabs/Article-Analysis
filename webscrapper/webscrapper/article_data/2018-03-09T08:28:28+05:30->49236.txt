When   visited   to speak to theatre enthusiasts about theatre and films recently, it was quite unlike any other celeb visit. With zero selfie requests, there was no chaos, no shoutouts but an attentive audience listening to every word the actor said. Adil’s session was part of a segment –   – of SRCC's annual theatre fest,  . The students asked a number of questions, from his early days in theatre to making it to films, his dream role, and his opinion on the responsibility of a  .

 
 
  When asked if he thinks that films can create an impact, giving an example of the film ' ', Adil told the students how the film made it easier for people to talk about menstruation without any hesitation. Citing another example, he said, "Movies do create a huge impact on the audience, especially on young people, who have an impressionable psyche. The kind of films we watch – it has shaped my personality too. I remember the way I used to express love in my teenage days using the lines spoken by Dharmendra or Bachchan sahab in their films. That's how we used to express our poetry in small towns."
 
  
  
 
  He added, "It is important that filmmakers are extremely responsible, in the sense that what they show, will have far-reaching consequences. They should think, 'If I make a film where there's excess violence, how would it impact the audience?', 'If we are commodifying women in our films, how would a guy look at a woman while crossing the street?'"
 
 
 
  In reply to a question on responsible filmmaking, Adil said, "Filmmakers are not psychologists, sociologists or political experts. We look up to them a bit too much. Most filmmakers think that the audience won't understand if they make a complex film because the audience is stupid. If we (filmmakers) make a good film, people will understand. But the people from the industry don't know how to make a good film which is interesting, yet responsible."
