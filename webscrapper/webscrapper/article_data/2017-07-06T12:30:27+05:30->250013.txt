AGRA: Just like previous years, more than 5,000 applications for   under the Right to Education ( ) Act in private schools have been   this year due to various reasons. Under the act, all private schools are supposed to reserve 25% of seats for children from economically backward sections.
 
  With registrations closed for this academic session, several reserved seats could not be filled and officials say that they had problems in verifying many applications due to incomplete information.
  
  Under this year’s RTE allotment list, only 3,289 children out of 9,800 applicants got admissions in private schools. The admission process started in March this year and was closed in mid-June. There were three lottery lists through which underprivileged kids got admissions.
  
  Sanjay Tomar, president of Association of Progressive schools of Agra, said, “There are a lot of seats reserved in private schools for poor children, but they are not filled. We entertain all the applications that are sent to us by the government.”
  
   , principal of GD Goenka Public School, said, “We get five-seven students from the government every year. The number is lesser than the reserved seats. Many applications are rejected because candidates do not have documents to verify their details. That’s why the admission process should not just be carried out online so that people can approach the authorities for assistance.”
  
  Basic Shiksha Adhikari Dinesh Kumar Yadav said, “According to the RTE Act, admissions can done throughout the year if seats are not filled. Due to official orders, the process for allotment has been stopped for now. We will check with private schools and will admit more kids in case the seats have not been filled.”
