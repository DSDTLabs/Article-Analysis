INDORE: The district collector’s guideline for   of as many as 69 newly   were finalised in a district valuation committee’s meeting held here on Thursday.

 “The rate of 69 colonies developed in Sanwer, Rau, Juni Indore, Moti Tabela, Aerodrome and some other areas were finalised in a meeting led by district collector P Narahari. The same will be sent to the state level committee for its final approval before implementing the guidelines for the current financial year,” senior district registrar,   told TOI.
 
 The official added that property registration in these colonies will be started soon once an approval comes from Bhopal.
 
 It was learnt that the district registrar office had prepared the property rate for these colonies in November but a delay in holding the district   to discuss and approve the rate delayed the overall procedure.
 
 Due to this, not were only the property registration in the mentioned colonies delayed, but the department also wasted a chance at increasing its revenue through property registration.
 
 Thursday’s meeting was held to finalise the property rate for the newly developed colonies for the current financial year, which has only two months left, and property rates for the next financial year will be decided at the next meeting.
 
 “A meeting to chalk out the collector’s guidelines of property rates for the district, including the newly developed colonies for the next financial year will be held in a fortnight,” said More.
