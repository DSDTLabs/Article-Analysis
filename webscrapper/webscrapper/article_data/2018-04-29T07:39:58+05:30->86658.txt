NEW DELHI: Though the capital’s   from   feel their   has   over the  , many of them do not have the power to decide how they can spend their own money. Their power to buy is often   by  , spouses or other people.

 
 A survey of 1,000 senior citizens by Agewell Foundation to ascertain the “Changing Patterns of Income and Expenditure in Old Age” found that just 37.8% of the financially independent among the respondents claimed to have the discretion to use their money as they wished. A significant 31.7% accepted their purchasing power was under the control of younger family members. While 25.1% admitted their spouses held the decision-making power, 5.4% said other people had the power to decide how they could use their money.
 
 
  But even as the study notes the strong position the middle income senior citizens are acquiring as consumers in the market, there are challenges for them. A case in point is 71-year-old Deepak Khurana of Punjabi Bagh who told the surveyors, “I support my younger family members as their income is limited … I have properties and get income in the form of rentals. Despite being the head of the family and main bread winner, my family members hardly consult me whenever they go for shopping or negotiate financial matters.”
 
 With 89% of the respondents reporting health-related problems, it wasn’t surprising that 803 of those who had some sort of monthly income spent 29% of it on healthcare services and products. The survey also established that the elderly, particularly those in the 60-70 age group, were internet savvy. To a question on whether they were digitally connected, 51% responded in the affirmative and 22% said no but wanted to get connected. However, 27% respondents said they had no interest.
 
 Most the senior citizens — 81% — felt that their purchasing power had increased over the past decade. Around 7% felt the opposite, 3% felt it had remained unchanged and 9% expressed inability to give an opinion. Around 58% of the respondents said they continued to contribute to family expenditure.
 
 The income of the elderly comes from monthly pensions, rent and post-retirement jobs. For 28% of the women and 33% men, pension was the main income. Jobs and gainful engagements were sources of money for 21% of the men and 19% of women. Business and profession contribute to the income of 14% of the men and 8% of the women. While just 2% of the male respondents reported nil or negligible income, 14% of the women fell in this category.
 
 As for the amounts, 15% said they earned Rs 25,000 or more every month. Around 13% put their monthly income at above Rs 20,000 but below Rs 25,000. The study rated 19% at the lower-middle income group with income of Rs 10,000-15,000. Of the 1,000 respondents, 203 said their monthly income was in the Rs 5000-10,000 range.
 
 The study also shows that a fifth of the elderly (21.4%) had a net worth of Rs 10-20 lakh, and just 85 respondents put their net worth at over Rs 50 lakh; 13% claimed their net worth was less than Rs 50 lakh but more than Rs 20 lakh.
 
 The study concluded that older persons constituted a consumer group with significant aggregate purchasing power and specific needs and policymakers at various levels should encourage manufacturers and service providers to bring to the market a sensitivity to the needs of senior citizens.
