LUCKNOW/JHANSI:   on Wednesday directed the   to probe a news report alleging that the   (DM) of Jalaun,  , had tried to influence   to pardon RJD chief Lalu Yadav in the fodder scam case.

 The news report had claimed that Akhtar called up the special CBI judge to seek pardon for Yadav in the case.
 
 Giving this information in Lucknow, officials said the commissioner has been asked to submit his report at the earliest.
 
 Yadav was awarded three-and-a-half year jail term and a fine of Rs 5 lakh on January 6 by the CBI judge, who on December 23 found Lalu and others guilty of fraudulently withdrawing Rs 89.23 lakh from Deoghar treasury by furnishing fake bills and vouchers related to fodder procurement between 1991 and 1994.
 
 During the proceedings of the case on January 4, the CBI judge had said “Laluji, we are getting a lot of references and calls for you”, without naming the people who had phoned him.
 
 Akhtar has denied the charge. “How can someone levy such grievous allegations without having even a shred of evidence. I belong to Assam and working in Uttar Pradesh. I have no connection of any kind with Laluji,” Akhtar told TOI on Wednesday.
