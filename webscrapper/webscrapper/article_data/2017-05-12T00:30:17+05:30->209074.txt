Chennai: How about   at   in Chennai?

 A sports forum created to promote Jallikattu as a game of bravery, has moved Madras high court for permission to hold the event inside Nehru Sports Academy stadium in Chennai.
 
 Justice K Kalyanasundaram, before whom the petition filed by Tamilanin Parampariya Veera Jallikattu Association represented by its president C Seemaisamy of Natham in Dindigul district, came up for hearing, issued notices to authorities and posted the matter to June 2 for further hearing. He also directed the petitioner to submit a fresh representation to the authorities mentioning specific date on which they want to conduct Jallikattu.
 
 However, when it was taken up for hearing, additional government pleader P Sanjai Gandhi said the government was not against the game, but having Nehru stadium as venue would not be possible, as the stadium had been built on international standard for other games. If Jallikattu is allowed it would be damaged, he said.
 
 The petition said allowing Jallikattu at Nehru stadium would help spread the game among people, and added that since there was no sports scheduled to be held in the stadium in the month of May, the organization had requested it be spared for Jallikattu. It undertook to pay the usual fee for the facility, and added that in case of any damage the association would reimburse it too.
 
 Though a representation was sent to the authority concerned about a month ago, there was no response, the petition said, adding that a public authority should not sit on such representations for months, without taking any decision.
