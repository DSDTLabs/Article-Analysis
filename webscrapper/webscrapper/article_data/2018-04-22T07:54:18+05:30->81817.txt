CHANDIGARH: Hansi police on Saturday detained the uncle of an eight-year old girl who was allegedly raped on Thursday night. 

 Hansi superintendent of police (SP) Pratiksha Godara said the uncle was the prime suspect as he had been changing his statements during the preliminary investigation. “We are interrogating him,” she said.
 
 The accused was the first to spot the girl at 11pm on April 18. According to him, he heard the girl’s cries and spotted her at some distance from the place they were camping. Sources said his statements did not match during investigation, so he was detained for more questioning. 
 
 The girl is still under treatment at a hospital. The SP said the girl was recovering fast. “The girl and her family have also been counselled and been given legal aid,” she said.
