CHARMINAR: The stray dog menace still continues to haunt certain areas of the  , trigerring panic among residents, especially during nights, as men, women and children fear walking alone due to wandering dogs. 

 Residents of Jiyaguda complained that children are attacked after dusk. They said despite complaints to authorities time and again, no initiatives were taken catch the dogs.
 
 "When we go to complain to authorities about stray dogs, they send us back with hollow words. Residents were assured many times by officials of sending dog catcher teams to their respective localities. But we don't find any one in our area," said Mohammed Abdul Azeem, resident of Mustiadpura. 
 
 Stray dogs are increasingly being seen even during daytime at Purnapul, Sabsimandi, Jiyaguda, Bheem Nagar and Mustaidpura. On Thursday, Arman, a five -year-old resident of   was attacked badly by a group of stray dogs under Jalpally municipality.
 
 "My son was playing outside the house in the morning. Suddenly a group of violent stray dogs surrounded him and one bit him. I rushed outside hearing his screams. If I didn't reach him on time, he might have been killed. If the   continues to neglect this, other children may also become victims,'' said Maimona, his mother.
 
 Animal activists point out that dogs from Old City are often arbitrarily picked up and released in other places, which cause territorial disputes, spiking agressiveness of the dogs. Additionally, many dogs have not been neutered or vaccinated. Several complaints were lodged with officials concerned, but to no avail. In some cases, squads just picked up strays and dumped them in other places without sterilizing them.
