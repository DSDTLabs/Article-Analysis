CHANDIGARH: After various reports of illicit collection of money from businesses and industry, Punjab chief minister   on Thursday directed the   (DGP) to crackdown on the so-called ‘goonda tax’.

 Amarinder asked the DGP to identify the culprits irrespective of political or other affiliations and take stern action against them. The decision came after the matter was flagged by some of the ministers in the cabinet meeting on Thursday. Finance minister   said his name was being vilified in the whole process that was adversely affecting business sentiment, which the state government was striving hard to promote.
 
 The chief minister said, “Such activities hinder the government’s efforts to bring industrial and economic development back on track and to provide a clean and transparent environment to boost industry and investment in the state.”
 
 Amarinder also asked the chief secretary to monitor the work of the committee set up to check illegal mining across the state.
