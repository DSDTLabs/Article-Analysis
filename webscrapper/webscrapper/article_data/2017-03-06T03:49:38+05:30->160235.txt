 Apna Dal is with me. My party workers are with me. I¡¦d like to clear the air that my husband Ashish Singh is not involved in the controversy between me and my mother. My mother and I have moved on. No point in any reconciliation. I decided to go with the PM¡¦s development agenda, she and others didn't.
 
 
 
 
 The differences were only over one seat. We're fighting on 11 seats but our presence is in 150. We¡¦re small but important. Apna Dal will help BJP by bringing OBCs along.
 
 
 
 
 The issue over the use of the original party's name, over which the dispute arose, has been sent to the court by the EC. My candidates are contesting on a different banner. The symbol is with us.
 
 
 
 
 Kasab was said in a lighter vein. The PM was referring to the electricity issue with a view on development, not to polarise the voter. As for banking on Kurmi voters, Apna Dal's backing is from Kurmis but as an MP I represent all communities. NDA promotes people from all castes.
