PANAJI: While recounting the efforts made by   stalwarts for Goa’s statehood, party functionaries on Wednesday said that Goans were seething in anger against the policies of the   government, especially the “mismanagement” of iron ore mining and power supply.

 
 “During our ‘Jana Gana Mana, Noman Tuka Goykara’ campaign, we have seen the anger among the people,” opposition leader   said. “We must use this anger to our advantage and ensure that the Congress wins the next time,” he said. Kavlekar was speaking at an event at Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry to mark 31 years of Goa’s Statehood. While several senior Congress leaders were present, most of the Congress MLAs gave the event a miss.
 
 “Calangute had no power. Today, Shiroda has no power. The electricity department’s failure has never been so bad,” Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president   said. Earlier, the party workers protested outside the entrance of   and demanded that the metal barricades that enclose a footpath should be removed within 24 hours. tnn
