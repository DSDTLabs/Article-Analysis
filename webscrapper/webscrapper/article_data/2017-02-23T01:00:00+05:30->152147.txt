An amalgamation of scenic backdrops, adrenaline-pumping car stunts and soulful music, the trailer promises everything a box-office entertainer is made of. That’s not all. With the film’s first song, Itna Tumhe, being well-received by the audiences, the makers are optimistic about the entire album being a success. Says  , “The trailer will convey more about the film and its storyline. To begin with, we have shot in some unexplored locations of Georgia, where no Bollywood film has been shot before. We have also incorporated some dialogues that come at a very important juncture in the movie. Along with a Formula One car, we’re also using a small vintage car in the film. The response to the teaser and the song have boosted our confidence and we’re positive that the trailer will be loved as much, too."
