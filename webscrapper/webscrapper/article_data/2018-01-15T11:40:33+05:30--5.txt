BHOPAL:   is set to get the country’s first on-station medical clinic within a week.

 Recently, the station received applauds for installing the first sanitary napkin vending machine at a railway station.
 
 Bhopal railway division officials said that a round the clock clinic will be inaugurated at Platform 1 within a week. The clinic will be run by an MBBS doctor and have stocks of lifesaving drugs and medicines, said an official.
 
 “If there is ever a medical emergency at the station, we inform the SS Commercial at the railway station and call a doctor from   railway hospital. If the doctor somehow cannot reach in time, the passenger has to suffer,” said an official.
 
 Pointing that such a move was need of the hour, senior divisional commercial manager   said, “Bhopal station will be the first to offer such a service.”
 
 We are also trying to get a medical shop, but since it is less profitable, less people are interested to set up a shop,” said the official.
 
 Pradeep Singh, station manager, Bhopal railway station, said “There was a need of medical aid at railway station as nearest medical shop is towards Platform 1 that too around a kilometre away from the railway campus.”
 
 He added, “Around 12 years ago, there was a medical shop at platform 1 which got shut down later as the vendor was not able to cover his expenses.”
 
 According to the rules laid down by Indian railways, Bhopal junction should have a ‘medical aid’ as it qualifies as an A1 class railway station.
 
 Interestingly, the station has been operating without the same for the last 12 years even when   as many as 10 calls every day for medical help.
