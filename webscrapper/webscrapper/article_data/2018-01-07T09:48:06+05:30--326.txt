TRICHY: Farming associations have appealed both Union and the state finance ministers to call upon representatives of farmers associations to discuss grievances and plans needed to uplift farmers before finalising the budget report, in line with consultations held with representatives of industrialists.

 They urged both the state and Union governments to convene a meeting to discuss various issues and measures required to address their grievances.
 
 “Former finance minister   during his tenure in 2007 met all the representatives of the farming community before budget preparation. However, UPA government’s initiative was not followed by the same regime during consequent years,” said Swamimalai R  , secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association.
 
 At the same time, functionaries should also be prepared to attend the meeting. For that they should hold a consultative meeting to frame a memorandum, he added. 
 
  district secretary of   Vivasayigal Sangam (affiliated to CPI) Ayilai Sivasuriyan and state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam N Veerasekaran too echoed Vimalnathan’s views.
 
 “Low growth, poor earnings and natural calamities have led to suicides - a signal that something is wrong with the farming sector across the country. Agricultural growth has been, on an average, lower than the non-agriculture sector. So, the Union government should at least take certain concrete action to set right in the right direction. For that, both the governments should convene a meeting where representatives of the farming community should be asked to present their representations,” they opined.
