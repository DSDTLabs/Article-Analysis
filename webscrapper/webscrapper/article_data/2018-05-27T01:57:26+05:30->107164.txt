NAVI MUMBAI: Twins   and   from Apeejay School of   received almost identical marks—94.8% and 95% respectively. 

 The duo followed an identical study schedule: A daily session from 5am to 7am, which the brothers claim was their success mantra. “We used to play volleyball and cricket to destress,” said Akhil, who is three minutes elder to Nikhil. The duo would also go watch movies at multiplexes during the board exams. 
 
 The twins said they prefer to study rather than mingle with friends and neighbours. Both have decided to pursue engineering from reputed college, either in mechanical or computer streams. 
 
 The parents claim there has never been any sibling rivalry.   scored 95% in all subjects while Akhil secured 95 in three subjects. In Class X too, they scored almost same—Akhil 96.2% and Nikhil 96.8%. Letting in on her secret, mother   said, “Many people get confused with the two. But Akhil has a mole on the right cheek while Nikhil has one on his left nostril. 
 
 “They are very determined. I did not have to make them sit for studies.” “The marks were predictable as we put in lot of efforts. We helped each other study, which is why we got good marks,” they said.
