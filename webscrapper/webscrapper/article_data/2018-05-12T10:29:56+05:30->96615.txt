 The governor had struck down the name of CPM leader A A Rasheed from the list provided by the government, against whom several cases are pending and many, including opposition leader   and BJP leaders, petitioned the governor. Now, the commission will be able to move quickly in disposing of around 15,000 appeals pending before it.
 
 The chief information commissioner,  , who was appointed by the UDF government and took charge in May 2016, had been trying to clear the backlog by hearing the appeals both from that of 2011as well as new ones, but the number of pending appeals were so much that the backlog has still not been cleared. As per the sources in the commission, it is learnt that chief information commissioner has asked the commissioners to clear the backlog within the next two years. Even though the UDF government had appointed five information commissioners along with the appointment of chief information commissioner in 2016, the matter was questioned in the court citing that none of them were qualified for the post.
 
 The chief information commissioner and the information commissioners have a tenure of either five years or till they turn 65 years of age, whichever is earlier.
