Ludhiana: In order to reduce traffic from Amar Shaheed Sukdev Inter-state Bus Terminus (main bus stand) towards Gill Chowk Flyover, which is currently under construction due to a collapsed wall, the new grain market situated in Salem Tabri will be temporarily used as an additional bus stand from Wednesday by the district administration for city-based road commuters.

 Exercising his right under Section 200(2) of Punjab Motor Vehicles Rules 1989, under Section 200(2), district magistrate-cum-deputy commissioner Pradeep Aggarwal has notified the new grain market in Salem Tabri as an additional bus stand for the convenience of city-based road commuters. The decision has been taken keeping in view demands raised by commissioner of Municipal Corporation (Ludhiana) and commissioner of police (Ludhiana).
 
 It has been mentioned in the notification that the main bus stand has not been completely closed for road commuters, but the reason behind notifying the new grain market as an additional bus stand is to reduce the traffic flow coming into the city, giving relief from long traffic jams. Moreover, the general manager of Punjab Roadways has been directed to ensure proper arrangement of buses at both bus stands and ensure necessary arrangements for the additional bus stand.
