PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body will form flying squads to check unauthorized   and leakages in the municipal limits. Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said these directives were given at the meeting held to review the water supply situation in the city.

 Hardikar said, “The number of flying squads will depend upon the availability of manpower. Strict action will be taken against those who misuse and waste water. We may also disconnect their supply. Every executive engineer has been directed to prepare a wardwise bulk water management plan for better management of the network and give adequate supply to citizens.”
 
 Mayor Nitin Kalje who presided over the review meeting gave directives to the civic administration to provide equitable water at adequate pressure and regularize the unauthorized connections. 
 
 He said officials must take measures to prevent wastage of water and repair faulty pipelines. The supply timings must be revised to midnight and afternoon for the convenience of citizens.
 
 Seema Savale, chairperson of the standing committee, said, “ Artificial scarcity is created by contractual workers and action must be taken against valvemen who do not adhere to time. Complaints about water supply will not drop until an improvement is made in the supply distribution system.”
 
 A BJP leader in the civic body said, “There must be water supply with pressure as Pavana dam, the lifeline of the city, is filled to 75% of its capacity. Improvements must be made in the supply distribution system. Citizens must receive abundant water supply for a minimum of two hours.”
