 Meanwhile, Manpreet, said, “The site selection committee has been set up to select sites for proposed plants at Jalandhar, Amritsar, Patiala and shifting of plant at Bathinda where it has already been set up. The committee has selected two sites for Bathinda and we are looking into its pros and cons. The state government is committed to shifting the plant at Bathinda as promised earlier.”
