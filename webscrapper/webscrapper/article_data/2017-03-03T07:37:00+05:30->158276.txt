AMRITSAR: Only Rs 12,571 were offered in the Martyrs’ Well of   over a period of 10 years, a reply by the Union ministry of culture to an   plea has revealed.

 Though the government claims that thousands of people visit the historic park near Golden Temple every day, the daily average for donations received in the well comes to just Rs 3.5 a day for the years from 2007 to 2016.
 
 The RTI activist who filed the plea, P C Sharma, said it seemed unbelievable that such a small amount had been given to pay homage to those who were martyred in the April 13, 1919, massacre. “The government itself admits that one lakh tourists and devotees visit Golden Temple every day and almost all of them visit Jallianwala Bagh too. Even if the number of those visiting Jallianwala Bagh is far less than those visiting Golden Temple, the amount of offerings in a day raises suspicion,” he said.
 
 In the massacre that had become a cornerstone for the Freedom Struggle that year, many people had jumped into the iconic well to escape the indiscriminate firing ordered by the then   officer Col Reginal Dyre. After the violence, hundreds of bodies were recovered from the well and it came to be known as ‘Maryrs’ Well’.
 
 The RTI information given by the Union ministry has also revealed that barring eight coins and five notes of Rs 10, rest of the offerings were made in the denomination of coins of Rs 1, 2 and 5. Sharma, an advocate by profession, said he had written to Prime Minster, who is also the chairman of the  , to ensure transparency in the offerings made by patriotically driven tourists and had also suggested installation of CCTVs.
