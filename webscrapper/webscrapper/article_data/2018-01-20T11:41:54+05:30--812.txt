Film actors being trolled and getting mocked down by public or the members of film community is quite familiar to us. It was only yesterday did two TV channel anchors poked fun at Suriya’s height. Later, they earned flak from the actor’s fans and many stars from the film fraternity. Actors like Vishal, Karunakaran Vignesh Shivn and producer   have voiced their condemnation to the VJs.

 Now, VJ Manimegalai who also works for the same channel has come out with a statement on twitter that is as good as esteeming the insensitive remarks apart from expressing her feelings over the matter.
 
 The VJ has stated a dialogue from one of Suriya’s super hit ‘Thaana Serndha Koottam’ which roughly translates to “How tall you are is not important, but to what extent you can grow in life is important.”
