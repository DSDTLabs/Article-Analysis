GHAZIABAD: Cops were left red-faced after a briefcase containing crucial investigation files pertaining to a graft case and a murder case were stolen from the vehicle of two officers belonging to UP Police’s anti-corruption organisation in Masuri.

 The crime took place on Monday evening. Police said a probe was ordered into the theft on Tuesday after an FIR under Section 379 (theft) of the IPC was lodged following a complaint by the two inspector-rank officers — Ashok Rana and Udaiveer Singh Sirohi — who are posted in Meerut.
 
 “A thorough enquiry has been ordered through the local police station to ascertain as to how crucial documents pertaining to investigations could be stolen from the possession of cops,” Ghaziabad’s SP (rural) Arvind Maurya told TOI.
 
 In their complaint, the two officers have stated that the briefcase was stolen from the rear seat of their vehicle at   in Masuri around 6 pm on Monday. The briefcase contained a service book and other documents, apart from the files of the two cases that they have been investigating.
 
 The first case, bearing file number 277/17, pertains to bribery and was registered at   police station of Meerut under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, this year only. The second case, bearing file number 112/11, pertains to a murder that was registered in 2011 at Khekda police station of Baghpat.
 
 Police sources, however, said the files that were stolen established the involvement of some police officials in the two cases. 
 
 “Enquiries have revealed the cops who have registered the theft complaint are due to retire in a few months’ time. Officials have been asked to find out if the two cops had any involvement, if at all, in the cases whose papers have been stolen. Besides, we are also trying to find out as to how a service book, which is an exclusive property of the government, was in the possession of the cops,” Maurya said.
