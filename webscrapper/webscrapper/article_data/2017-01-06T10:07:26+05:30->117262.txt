NEW DELHI: Did the four constables involved in the custodial death of the 24-year-old fruit vendor,  , trick the   into believing that they were carrying the injured man to the hospital, but dumped him beside   station? A probe suggests that the four constables spent nearly 45 minutes on deciding what to do while the injured man lay bleeding inside the police station.

 One of the constables, Inderaj, who has turned approver, blamed the SHO, inspector Sanjay Kumar, and the three others for making the plan to dump the body into a drain. The inspector has claimed that he was unaware of their plan and had asked the constables to use his official vehicle to take Sompal to a hospital.
 
 The two constables,   and Surender, had found Sompal lying face down in the courtyard, who had fallen unconscious due to excessive bleeding. They then discussed whether they should inform senior officers or dump the body secretly. The SHO was on a patrol at that time. Kuldeep informed him about the incident after half an hour and Kumar rushed to the police station.
 
 Kumar claimed that he had advised the constables to take Sompal in his vehicle, but instead of taking him to the hospital, the four constables decided to dump him near the metro station. Kuldeep claimed that he had informed the SHO about the death. The call records of all the policemen are being scanned to verify their claims.
 
 An investigation is also being carried out to ascertain if the SHO had tried to shield the constables from a probe after the body was discovered a few hours later. He would be questioned as to why nothing was noted in the records at the police station. The initial autopsy has revealed that Sompalâ€™s knees were broken and he had head injuries.
