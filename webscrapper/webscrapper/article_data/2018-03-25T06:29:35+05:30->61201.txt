BENGALURU: While banks may have been dismissive about their ATMs running dry, there have been increasing instances of cashless machines developing snags as frustrated customers land furious punches and kicks on the machines, as evident in   footages. 

 On Friday morning, a mechanic was seen fixing an ATM in northwest Bengaluru. He was accompanied by the cash loader and the gunman of a van belonging to a cash logistics firm.
 
  According to the logistics firm staff, in the area they operate, at least 20 ATMs have developed snags over the past week after angry customers kicked the machines on finding them empty. In a couple of places the display screens too were broken. 
 
 "Such attacks end up damaging sensitive and vital parts of the ATM like card reader, display screen and cash dispenser," they said, adding that 
 
 "This is the 13th machine I've repaired in the past eight days. All of them developed technical snags due to kicks landing on their front portion which has sensitive sensors connected to the motherboard. A machine won't work even if one wire is disconnected," the mechanic explained.
 
 The logistics firm employees said they take the mechanic wherever they go, as almost every day they have been coming across such damaged machines. "We have repaired machines in areas like Majestic, Chamarajpet, Goodshed Road, Dr Rajkumar Road, Yeshwantpur and surrounding areas. Most were damaged at night," the staff said.
 
 However, bank officials blamed the ATM issues on 'banking problems' and refused to elaborate. "It's a sensitive issue and we cannot comment on it. But cash flow from the head office to branches has fallen drastically," a bank manger said.
 
  Part bearing the brunt 
 
 * Cash dispenser: 'Heart' of an ATM is at the bottom and dispenses cash
 
 * Cash chest: On an average, Rs 2 crore can be filled in it
 
 * Display screen: Guides cardholder through transaction
 
 * Card reader: Captures account information stored on magnetic stripe of a card
