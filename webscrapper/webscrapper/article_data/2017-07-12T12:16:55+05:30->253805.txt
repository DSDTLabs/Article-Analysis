MANDYA:   held a massive   in   on Tuesday as the Supreme Court commenced the final hearing on sharing of Cauvery water.

 Nearly 1,000 police personnel participated in the rally spearheaded by Mandya SP G Radhika. The security drill was a precautionary measure to prevent any outbreak of violence. The procession passed through the Mysuru-Bengaluru highway, commercial streets, 100 Feet Road, VV Road and other important thoroughfares. 
 
 Apart from this, security was strengthened at all taluk centres; even Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) reservoir saw heavy police presence. A large posse of police personnel patrolled the Mysuru-Bengalru highway as the stretch has been the epicentre of the Cauvery-related agitation in the past.
 
 By dusk, police officers heaved a sigh of relief as no untoward incident took place. “The security cover has nothing to do with the final hearing of the Cauvery dispute. Nowadays, it has become a norm for the apex court to order Karnataka to release water to Tamil Nadu as interim relief. Hence we didn’t want to take any chance and deployed a large number of police personnel,” said a senior police.
 
 
 
 
 Citizens were taken by surprise as they had no idea about the flag march. Rumours saying the Supreme Court would deliver its final verdict in the Cauvery dispute did the rounds, triggering confusion.
