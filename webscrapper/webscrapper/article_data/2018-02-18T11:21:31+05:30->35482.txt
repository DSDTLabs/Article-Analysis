Chandigarh: To cut down their reliance on costly conventional power, city-based industrial units are now eying to make use of the roofs on their units by installing solar panels, bringing down their inflated energy bills.

 The Industries Association of Chandigarh ( ) has roped in a Mumbai-based company which has agreed to install solar rooftop power plants on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. The firm has agreed to install rooftop solar power plants with net metering free of cost. Net metering is an agreement that allows a consumer to sell excess solar energy to the utility, while in gross metering total solar power generated is exported to grid.
 
 Both the parties will enter into agreement for a period of 10 years. During the period, the industrial units will charged as per their existing power bill on which they will get discount up to 15%. Upon completion of mutually agreed period, the firm will transfer the ownership of the power plant to the industrial unit.
 
 Y K  , president, IAC, said there is no capital investment involved and during the agreement period of 10 year, units will get discount up to 15% and thereafter, the ownership of the plant will be shifted to the industrial unit. “During the period of 10 years, industrial units will save up to 15% and after 10 years they will not have to pay anything for power generated by the plants on their rooftop,” said Mahajan. On an average, life of a rooftop power plant is 25 years.
 
 Vikas   of   said they have received good response from industrialists and will start installing power plants after entering into agreements with them. “It will be a win-win situation for the industrial units as they will not have to pay anything for setting up the plant, of which they will become owners after 10 years,” said Aggarwal.
 
 The industrialists are reeling under high power rates. An industrial unit in the city shells out around Rs 10 per unit, including other charges. The move will not only help industrialists to bring down their power cost, but will also help the UT administration to achieve the target of producing solar power set by the Central government.
 
 Chandigarh has been selected by the Centre to be developed as a “model solar city” and has set an ambitious target of generating 50MW of solar energy — both residential and government — by 2022.
 
 In the past three years, Crest has generated 20.36 million units (MU), equivalent to reduction of 1,410 metric tonne of CO2 and planting a total of 15.3 lakh trees. Of 20.36 MU, bulk of power has been produced by plants on government buildings.
 
 HOW IT WILL WORK
 
 Plants ranging between 50 Kw to 999 Kw to be installed
 
 Mutual agreement for a period of 10 years
 
 Industrial units to be charged as per existing bill on which discount upto 15% will be given.
 
 Ownership of plant to be transferred after period of 10 year.
 
 EXAMPLE
 
 Plant Size
 
 100 kW
 
 Time of installation
 
 4 Months
 
 Total Annual Radiation (Units produced in year)
 
 1,50,000 kW
 
 Solar Tariff (10% discount)
 
 Rs. 7.2/kW (Grid Tariff of Rs 8 /kW)
 
 Term of Power Purchase
 
 10 Years
 
 Net Savings in 10 years
 
 Rs. 0.8 x 1.5 lakh Units=Rs. 1.2 lakh per year X 10 Years = Rs. 12,00,000
 
 Savings from 11th to 25th year (Asset transfer after 10th year to client)
 
 1,50,000 KW X Rs. 8/ KW = Rs. 12,00,000 Yearly savings X 15 Years =Rs.1,80,00,000
 
 Total Savings
 
 Rs.12,00,000 + 1,80,00,000 = Rs. 1,92,00,000
