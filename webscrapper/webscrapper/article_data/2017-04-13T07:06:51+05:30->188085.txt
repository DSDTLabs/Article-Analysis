MANGALURU: Come May 1 IndiGo is all set to become the fifth airline after Air India, Air India Express,   and Spice Jet to touch base with   International Airport. IndiGo will operate two daily flights to Bengaluru and one to Mumbai, reinforcing its commitment to South India market. Flights to Bengaluru will depart MIA at 7am and 4.20pm and reach   at 7.55am and 5.15pm respectively and Mumbai at 12.05pm to reach there at 2pm.

 Sanjay  , chief commercial officer of IndiGo, told reporters that the airline is offering all inclusive promotional fare of Rs 1,499 on Mangaluru-Bengaluru sector and Rs 1,799 on Mangaluru-Mumbai sector. This fare will be in vogue for first two months of operation, he said adding that online sale of tickets that commenced three weeks ago has garnered good response from flyers. The new services will further consolidate IndiGo’s position, he noted.
 
 Noting that the airline presently operates 907 daily flights connecting 45 destinations across the country, Sanjay said, “Mangaluru is a good entry for IndiGo. We are generally the last to enter the market, but the fastest to capture the same with our quality service.” IndiGo will commercially explore avenues to connect other domestic centres from Mangaluru including Delhi via Hyderabad and introduce a third flight to Bengaluru in the near future, he noted.
 
 With a fleet size of 132 A320s as of now and expected to touch 154 aircraft by end of March 2018, Sanjay said, “Adding new flights and frequencies on our network is aligned with our commitment to expand affordable air travel in India. The new flights not only strengthen domestic network but also help us better serve increased demand in growing markets.” International operations from MIA are very much on the cards and plans are being worked out, he added.
