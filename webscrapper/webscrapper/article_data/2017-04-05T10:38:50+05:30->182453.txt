In 1995, the incumbent JD government led by Biju Patnaik had summarily lost the assembly election. It won only 46 out of 147 seats, down from its tally of 123 in 1990 while the Congress won 80 seats, staging a massive comeback from just 10 MLAs in the previous election. 

 Claiming that the Naveen-led party will crumble due to its internal problems, Jual said: "Many senior leaders, MLAs and MPs, including those from the BJD, are in touch with us, especially after the recent elections in four states (Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur)," Jual said. BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb was quick to dismiss Jual's remarks as figment of his imagination. "Nobody from the BJD will join the  . Jual is living in his own world. His claims are completely baseless," Pratap said.
 
 Jual's statement comes two days after oil minister   said many BJD leaders have started to avoid the party. BJD MP and the party's chief whip in Lok Sabha,   had recently alleged in a series of tweets that the BJP intends to split the BJD with the help of an MP from his own party.
