HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum has directed a mobile network operator to pay a sum of Rs 10,000 as compensation to a customer for activating ‘wrong’ tariff and failing to address the issue even after several complaints. The consumer,  , purchased a SIM card worth Rs 255 from   e- shop for which the base tariff for outgoing calls was priced at one paisa/second across all the networks, including landlines with some additional benefits. However, he submitted that the mobile network company wrongly activated another plan where the base tariff was priced at 1.6 paisa/second for mobiles and 2 paisa/second for landline.

 “I have made several complaints via emails, telephone calls, but still the problem was not resolved. I even approached   —   — and registered a complaint at www. Pgportal.gov.in, but nothing has been done,” submitted Agarwal before the forum seeking justice and compensation. The DoCoMo authorities, meanwhile, contended that the complaint filed against the branch manager of the company was not maintainable.
 
 “There is no such designation in our company, even otherwise he cannot be held personally responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the company. So, the complaint is liable to be dismissed for ‘misjoinder’ and ‘nonjoinder’ of necessary parties. Moreover, Tata DoCoMo is only a brand name and it is not a company. On this ground also the present complaint is liable to be dismissed,” contended the network company. 
 
 Not impressed with the contention of the opposite party, the bench said that the party failed to provide promised service, and directed them to pay Rs 10,000 as compensation and Rs 5,000 towards costs.
