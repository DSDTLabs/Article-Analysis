PATNA: The special investigation team (SIT) of Patna police probing the   (BSSC) question paper leak case, will take   alias  , an accused, on two-day remand for interrogation on Wednesday.
 
  Brar was arrested by the SIT from New Delhi on March 20 and brought to Patna on a three-day transit remand. Former BSSC chairman   had allegedly flouted rules to give Brar the job to print optical mark reader (OMR) sheets for the intermediate level clerical grade examination. “No tender was floated for the purpose,” said a source.
  
  Sources said the SIT had moved special vigilance court-I of judge   on Tuesday, requesting three-day of police remand for Brar. The court, however, granted two-day remand of the accused. Police have so far arrested 34 persons in connection with the case.
