GOA: Earlier, it had warned him during the 2015  . “...the   censures you for violating the aforesaid provisions of   and expects that you shall be more circumspect in your public utterances during election time. You may also note that in case of similar violation of MCC in future, the Commission shall take stern action , using all powers available to it including action under Para 16(A) of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968,” the   said in its order on Saturday. 

 Para 16 of Election Symbols order empowers EC to suspend or withdraw recognition of a national or state party on being convinced that such party had failed or refused to observe provisions of the model code of conduct.
 
 Kejriwal was quick to slam the EC order. “I don’t understand what the EC is up to. It can’t stop bribery; money is being given and taken all around,” he alleged.
 
 “The commission wants to say don’t do what Kejriwal is sayingtake their money but vote for me. It wants to say that vote for only those from whom you are taking the money,” he said in Goa.
 
 Terming the EC order as “illegal, unconstitutional and wrong,” he said he would be challenging it. 
 
 Kejriwal had, while addressing a public meeting at Mapusa last year, called upon electors to ask for Rs 10,000 when offered Rs 5,000 by workers of rival parties, citing price rise, and to accept only new currency. A complaint was filed with the EC, which asked the AAP chief to explain the remark.
 
 In his reply, Kejriwal did not deny having made the impugned statement but claimed that he had neither offered any bribe to any elector nor enticed electors to accept any pecuniary benefit from any person.
 
 The commission on Saturday dismissed Kejriwal’s reply as “not at all convincing”.
