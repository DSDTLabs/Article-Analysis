PATNA: Torrential rain continued for the second consecutive day on Monday with the weatherman recording 110.4mm rain during the last 36 hours. 

 Though all the sump houses were claimed to have been made functional and motor pumps used to drain the rainwater out of Patna, many localities remained inundated for hours.
 
 So much so that St Xavier’s High School announced closure on Monday due to waterlogging outside the school near Gandhi Maidan. “All the classes except the +2 section were shut,” vice-principal Fr Christi Savrirajan told TOI, adding the +2 classes were also held only in the second half. 
 
 Chajju Bagh, Birla Mandir-Khetan Market road, Langar Toli, Bihari Sao lane, Bhanwar Pokhar, Peermohani, Thakurbari road and the area around Gandhi Maidan remained waterlogged almost throughout the day. Rainwater also accumulated outside the Buddha Smriti Park and the Bihar State Text Book Corporation campus.
 
 According to Patna Municipal Commission’s commissioner Abhishek Singh, draining out rainwater becomes difficult in any city if the showers don’t stop. “If rain stops on Monday night, sump houses will rid the whole city of the rainwater accumulated on the roads and lanes,” he said.
 
 However, the Indian Meteorological Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall widely distributed all over Bihar till Wednesday. Rainfall is also predicted on Thursday and Friday, albeit in parts of the state.
 
 According to Skymet, a trough of low pressure is seen across UP and Bihar up to the Gangetic West Bengal because of which the moisture incursion will increase over the region, resulting in cloud development and subsequent heavy to very heavy rainfall at places in Bihar during the next 48 hours.
