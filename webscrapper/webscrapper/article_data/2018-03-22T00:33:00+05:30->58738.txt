Madurai: Wildlife officials at Mandapam forest range at Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park seized 100 kilograms of live sea cucumbers after they intercepted a van. The forest team on Wednesday afternoon spotted the van at Munaikadu in Ramanathapuram coast under suspicious circumstances and gave them a chase.  The occupants of the van abandoned the vehicle at Vedhalai and fled. Inspecting the vehicle, officials found 100 kilograms of live sea cucumbers stored in drums. Officials using a tractor towed the van back to Mandapam range office and approached Rameswaram magistrate for the special permission to release them back in the sea, since the marine species were alive. After obtaining permission from the court, the live sea cucumbers were released back in the sea from Pamban bridge in the presence of fisheries and wildlife officials.
