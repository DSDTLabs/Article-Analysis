LUDHIANA: In a blow to the proposal of fixing   as minimum qualification for contesting elections of   it has now emerged that according to rule No 24 of the club’s constitution, non-graduate members of the club are allowed to contest polls. 

 According to club rules, any kind of amendment in its constitution is only allowed after 15-day prior notice at the annual general meeting (AGM) that took place on March 11 and no such notice was given in advance for any kind of change in constitution then. 
 
 However, the proposal has sparked off a debate amongst club members on whether fixing graduation as a benchmark for contesting on any kind of post of managing committee of club is justified or not. According to senior club member and retired IFS officer of the club  , “This is a wrong proposal as it is totally against our constitution. Moreover, if so many restrictions are imposed on contesting the elections who will come forward to fight club elections. In case of educational qualifications, it is clearly mentioned in the rule 24 of the club’s constitution that non-graduate members will be allowed to contest elections of the club. Therefore, we should be guided by constitution unless its amended and that too was only possible before the AGM.”
 
 Amidst the educational qualification row, campaigning for elections has started discreetly with interested candidates organising meetings with their supporters and the politicians, who have good fan following in the club. It is likely that the prospective candidates will come out in open once there is clarity about the proposal of educational qualification and date of elections is formally announced.
