PATNA: If everything goes as planned, Patna would be developed on the lines of British cities.   ( ) commissioner Abhishek Singh had recently urged British deputy high commissioner Bruce   to help the civic body sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with any such British city which has similar population like Patna.

 Singh, who had a meeting with Bucknell at the PMC office here recently, said, “Once the MoU is signed, we will get technical support from Britain to make Patna a developed city. Civic amenities have already improved in Patna and once the MoU is signed, it will be developed on the lines of the British city,” Singh said.
 
 He added Patna is one of the five Indian cities which the   has selected for climate studies. “Britain will provide climate risk insurance to these cities on the basis of the study report,” Singh said. The other four selected cities are Kolkata, Pune, Chennai and Kochi.
 
 “Patna is prone to natural disasters, especially floods. The British High Commission will study issues related to flood susceptibility, especially from the Ganga, the Punpun and their tributaries. They would study the hazard level and expected loss to make a tentative estimate for insurance,” Singh added.
 
 He said Bucknell also expressed his desire to help Patna compete in the   contest. “He has offered collaboration in the field of climate resilient technology and infrastructure development,” Singh said.
 
 The British deputy high commissioner also reviewed the UK’s department of international development (DFID)-supported support programme for urban reform (SPUR).   provides support to other countries in reducing poverty.
