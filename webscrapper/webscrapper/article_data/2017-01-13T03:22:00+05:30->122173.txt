Panaji: Even before the Bharatiya Janata Party ( ) could announce him as party’s candidate for the St Andre constituency on Thursday, Ramrao Wagh, Goa University computer science faculty and brother of deputy speaker, Vishnu Wagh, had obtained permission from the vice-chancellor and executive council to contest the February 4 state assembly election.

 Vishnu Wagh, BJP’s sitting MLA from St Andre, is unable to contest the election owing to his critical illness. He is presently in a hospital in Mumbai.
 
 Ramrao, who is serving as an associate professor, has over a decade of service left before attaining superannuation. 
 
 He is expected to use his regular leave during the campaigning period. “If he is elected, it is unlikely that extraordinary leave will be denied to him,” said a varsity official.
 
 He holds a BSc degree in physics and masters in computer applications. Ramrao has earlier worked on various government committees on information technology and is an active member of the Goa Andhashradha Nirmulan Samiti.
