Directed by Sriwass, known for films like 'Loukyam' and 'Dictator', some action scenes of the untitled Telugu film were canned at Raja Ghat. As the camera started rolling, Ashutosh Rana and Bellamkonda Sai Srinivas got into the act. Ace action choreographer, Peter Hein of   and   fame was spotted choreographing the action scenes.
 Rana, who is the antagonist in the film, is shooting for the first time in Banaras. "Though I come to the city rather frequently for spiritual reasons but professionally this is my first time here. To shoot on the ghats with river Ganga in the backdrop is just amazing. For a spiritual person like me, it is a kind of blessing. Banaras is such a beautiful place that no matter where you place the camera, it turns out breathtakingly beautiful on celluloid," says Rana, who will be back in the city next month for Anubhav Sinha's Mulk, in which he has a prominent role.
