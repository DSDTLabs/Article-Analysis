GUWAHATI: In a throwback to reunions we see in films, the family tree in an NRC update process in Assam on Monday brought two cousin brothers together after almost 43 years! 

 The   is one of the key promises made by the   to identify   who entered the state after 1971. The fate of many citizens would depend on the publication of the NRC list-the first draft of which has already been published and the process of the next one is under way.
 
 Among many citizens, cousins Sukleswar, 53, and Bipin, 46, had filed their applications for verification. But little did the two know that both had used the same family tree to establish their legacy data.
