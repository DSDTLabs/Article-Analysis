Mysuru: Commuters in city buses here will soon have free access to the  . The   unit here will be the first city transport authority in the state to set up Wi-Fi modems in buses.

 Mysuru city has 430 city buses, including luxury ones, that ply on different routes and more than half the city population travels by it. Every day, thousands of tourists come to the Heritage City and use the city buses and students with bus passes also travel by them.
 
 If all goes according to plan, all city buses will start providing free internet from February first week. Every city bus will have a separate modem to transmit data to commuters. Commuters can access current affairs, online news and video accessible web portals but won’t be able to access social networking sites and porn websites will be blocked. It’ll be like the internet access available in the railway station.
 
 Commuters can get connected to the city bus Wi-Fi modem with a One Time Password (OTP) and after the launch of Mitra application, the link will be made available to get accessibility.
 
 KSRTC City transport division controller KH Srinivas said: “The main intention of setting up modems is to be entertained while travelling and draw a large number of commuters to public transportation. The internet access will be completely free for commuters.”
 
 The project has been handed to private company KPIT, which is the authority sponsored project. The work has been initiated and by the month-end it’ll be completed and officially inaugurated next month, Srinivas said.
 
 Omkar, an engineering student, said: “It is a good initiative. The commuters won’t be bored if we’re caught in traffic. It’s also a good move by blocking social networking sites as most youths are addicted to it. It’ll help us get updated about news, etc.”
