Nagpur: Enraged over being scolded by dad for chatting with a male friend on WhatsApp for a long time, an 18-year-old girl committed suicide in the city on Sunday afternoon. The incident took place in Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in MIDC area. According to senior police inspector Sunil Mahadik, Arvind Dange (50) was upset with his youngest daughter Amisha, who had failed in polytechnic 2nd year exam, for ignoring his advise to limit use of WhatsApp. Arvind had “warned” Amisha last Thursday. However, Amisha did not pay any heed and continued to spend considerable time chatting on mobile. This angered Arvind and he snatched Amisha’s mobile and smashed it into pieces. Amisha got very upset over this and she locked herself in the study room upstairs. When she did not join other family members downstairs for a long time, Arvind and Amisha’s cousin went to her study room. They found it locked from inside, but somehow managed to open the door and found Amisha hanging from a ceiling fan. The shocked family members informed MIDC police who sent Amisha to Government Medical College and Hospital where doctors declared her brought dead. The cops have filed an accidental death report, following the complaint of Arvind, senior clerk at a Dhantoli-based school.
