NAGPUR: The   for both   and   this time looks bleaker than the previous year. While only 8,500 applicants have registered for 22,065 polytechnic seats in Nagpur region, just 9,775 students have confirmed their seats against nearly the 21,000 intake capacity.

 The poor response from students had forced the directorate of technical education (DTE) to extend the online registration of application for   to polytechnic courses to July 4.
 
 But that too has not helped the DTE from getting more registrations for polytechnic. In fact, out of the 9,814 registrations last year, only 8,793 had finally taken admission. As compared to this, the registrations this year are lower than the actual admissions done in 2016, which means the final number is going to further come down.
 
 Engineering, that has seen a decline in takers since 2010, too continued its poor show. At the end of first centralized admission process (CAP), not even 50% registrations converted into confirmations. Last year, 10,838 seats remained vacant as only 12,767 candidates were admitted against the total registration of 19,706. The intake last year stood at 23,605 which too has now come down to 21,000. 
 
 Regional DTE officials said the situation would remain uncertain for engineering till seats are allotted and students report to the institutes. A clear picture for both engineering and polytechnic would emerge after July 30, they said.
 
 Till the original deadline of June 30, only 5,000 application kits were sold for polytechnic courses. The abysmal record in polytechnic had resulted in six colleges shutting down in the region and the intake capacity coming down from 24,010 to 22,065. There are 26 polytechnic institutes in the city having 8,895 seats. The Nagpur region comprises six districts of Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli.
 
 DTE officials and colleges are not expecting any improvement as they feel students now are aspiring for degree courses or skill-based programme having high employment chances. Another reason being attributed is the race for IITs. Thus, students are more than willing to join junior   and focus on competitive exams after HSC rather than choosing the engineering field post SSC.
