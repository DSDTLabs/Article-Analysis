Allahabad: Even as academic session is nearing its end in the next couple of months, the authorities are yet to crack down on the illegal occupants in many hostels of Allahabad University. 

 A number of illegal occupants and even outsiders are enjoying a free stay at the expense of needy students because of the lack of any action from the authorities. AU’s negligence in conducting raids in hostels from time to time, has created more problems for students who come to Allahabad from other cities.
 
 Although AU authorities are blaming the district police administration for the delay in raids, the latter on its part is unable to provide the needed force as amajor chunk of police force is busy with the ongoing Magh Mela. 
 
 “The delay in raids is because the university is collecting data about hostellers, so that a comprehensive report could be prepared and in future raids would conducted,” said Prof Yogeshwar Tiwari, AU PRO.
 
 Given the limited occupancy available in these hostels, the university had released a list of students and allotted to them rooms several months back but many of them have still not been given the possession of their allotted rooms.
 
 A source at AU said, “The nexus between these illegal occupants and the suprintendents is behind the lack of action from the university.” In the given situation, we are assured that the superintendent of a hostel, is not likely to request a for raid, as exams are around the corner. Thus, for most of the illegal occupants the hostels are a safe bet,” said an inmate of G N Jha hostel who is staying as a guest (what the illegitimate inmates like them to be called as) for last many years.
