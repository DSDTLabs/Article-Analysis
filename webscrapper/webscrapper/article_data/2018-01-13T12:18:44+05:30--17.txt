AHMEDABAD: Despite industry expecting a cut in the basic   duty (BCD) on   imports, experts don’t foresee a reduction, at least in this budget session. BCD on gold imports is 10% in addition to 3%  . With more incidents of gold smuggling, analysts and bullion traders want to see BCD on the yellow metal reduced.

 Rajesh Khosla, chairman emeritus, MMTC-PAMP said, “A reduction of BCD on gold imports is needed and jewellers and bullion traders have asked for it. However, unless GST revenue stabilizes, a cut in BCD is not possible. It doesn’t make sense to cut one source of revenue when the other isn’t stable.”
 
 Khosla was at a conference on ‘Gold and Gold Markets’ at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad on Friday. “We can look forward to 5% cut in 6-8 months, when GST revenues is in line with expectations,” he said.
 
 Industry experts said duty-paid gold imports for the financial year 2017-18 will hit 650 tonnes, at an average price of US $1,300 per ounce. Analysts say this won’t hurt the current account deficit, because international gold prices are low, compared to 2013-14 financial year.
 
 “From April to December 2017, 500 tonnes of gold was imported. Imports will hit 650 tonnes by the end of the fiscal, at a par with the 2016-17 fiscal,” said Khosla.
