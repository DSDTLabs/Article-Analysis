BENGALURU: An Indian and three   were arrested in Bengaluru for staying in India under   for the last nine months.

 The Pakistani nationals from Karachi include Kirhon Ghulam Ali, 26, her cousin  , 25, and Khasif Shamshuddin, 30.The fourth individual who was apprehended, Muhammad Shihab, is from Kerala and is married to Samira. Khasif to Kirhon are also married and the four had been living together in South Bengaluru.
 
 Police have taken all four in custody and recovered three Pakistani passports, Indian voter identity cards, and Aadhaar cards from them. Central intelligence agencies are assisting the city police to investigate if they were conspiring against India.
 
 During the interrogation, Shihab told police he met Samira in Muscat, Oman, when he was employed over a year ago. They fell in love and wanted to get married, but Samira's family opposed it. Kirhon's marriage to Khasif was also opposed by their families, and so the couple, along with Samira left Pakistan together and came to Muscat. The three eventually came to India via Kathmandu. 
 
 Shihab, who had previously worked at Bengaluru before his Muscat stint, rented a house in the city. In the rental agreement, the women had changed their names -Kirhon to Kiran and Samira to Najma. They used these new names for their Indian identification documents.
 
 Senior cops were mum on the details of what led to the arrest. “We got a tip off regarding them while investigating another case,“ police said, adding that the Pakistani nationals have been charged under the Foreigners Act, Passport Act and provisions of the Indian Penal Code for forging official documents.
