IMPHAL: Amid rising instances of crimes against women and children, the BJP-led government in   is considering a bill seeking capital punishment for perpetrators of such crimes. 

 "We will come up with a bill in the ensuing state assembly to award capital punishment to offenders in crimes against women, especially perpetrators of crimes against minor girls," chief minister   said on Thursday evening. He added that two new women police stations have been set up to help counter such crimes. Last year, the state reported 285 cases of crimes against women.
 
 Besides, a fast-track court for crimes against women has convicted 12 criminals so far. The government has also launched legal awareness programmes on the issue. 
 
 Condemning the Kathua and Unnao rape cases, Biren said, "The Manipur government seeks fitting punishment for the criminals."
 
 Commenting on the  's verdict on Justice Loya's death case, the chief minister demanded Congress president Rahul Gandhi to apologize to the nation for allegedly conspiring to defame BJP president   and the judiciary of the country. 
 
 Even as the Congress made an intentional attempt to defame and cause damage to the political career of Amit Shah, the nation's judiciary has finally revealed the truth, Biren said. 
 
 On the other hand, the state government, in a bid to save human lives during road accidents, notified that if any government employee travelling in a government vehicle happens to be near the site of a road accident, he should take the victim to the nearest medical unit in that government vehicle.
