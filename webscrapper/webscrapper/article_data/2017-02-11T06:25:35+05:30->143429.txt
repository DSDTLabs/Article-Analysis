KOLKATA: The biggest street carnival   has witnessed this year, dedicated to fun and fitness and giving pedestrians and cyclists their share of road space, will be back on Sunday. Just like the last two times,  , an initiative by The Times of India, will be hosted at the T-shaped polygon comprising Broadway and   just adjacent to  . 

 “We want people to come out and enjoy fun-filled activities on this street, which is usually jam-packed with vehicles and has little space for pedestrians,” said C Sudhakar, joint commissioner (headquarters) of   Police. The cops will set up their own stall that will feature the police band, bomb disposal squad activities, demo sessions on speed guns, breathalysers and drones and will also display police bikes, which people can take selfies with.
 
 Readers will get another special offering this Sunday — those carrying a copy of TOI will get free cycles during the entire period of the activity from 6.30-9.30am.
 
 “Cycling is a popular activity worldwide, but sadly, we are moving away from it. One can’t even take an evening stroll as roads are congested and not safe for a walk. Happy Streets gives citizens a chance to use the road for three hours just for themselves, the way they like it,” state additional chief secretary Debashis Sen had said during one of his visits on the first two days of the event.
