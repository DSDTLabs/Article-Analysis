NEW DELHI: India’s first no-fly list (NFL), which was supposed to be implemented from early July, has got delayed and is now expected to be enforced after a month or so. The reason: the government is examining how databases of different airlines can be linked so that a person put on   by one airline isn’t able to fly on other Indian carriers either.

 “Implementing the NFL without an inter-connected database could mean less effective implementation of the NFL. So we have decided to first see how to have an interlinked database among airlines and we hope to have the no fly list out in a month or so,” aviation secretary   said.
 
 The roll out of databank creation could be like this: People booking domestic tickets will be asked to give details of some identity card like Aadhaar, passport, election commission’s voter card or driving licence. Those booking international tickets have to give passport details.
 
 In this way airlines will start compiling a database of  . “We are seeing how to make the databases of different airlines talk to each,” Choubey said.
 
 The draft rules for NFL puts onboard disruptive behaviour into three categories and prescribes different grounding periods for each level, with the ban on flying going up to a lifetime for the most serious unruly flyers.
