Mangaluru: A head constable attached to the Mangaluru City Police Commissionerate,  , died on Saturday after he reportedly tried to escape from the district court building premises by jumping off the fourth floor.

 Praveen, 35, of Manjeshwar was booked under Pocso Act and Indian Penal Code 354(c) for secretly filming a mother and her daughter taking bath. When he was produced in the district court on Saturday, he reportedly tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor to the second floor. Police said he has received injuries on legs and was immediately shifted to District Wenlock Hospital. The incident took place around 5pm. He was responding to treatment.
 
 The constable might have died due to internal injuries or a suspected cardiac arrest, said senior police officers. “However, we are waiting for medical reports to confirm about the death,” they added.
 
 Police added that Praveen, who was staying at a place under Bajpe police station limits in a rented house, had allegedly filmed a minor taking bath. He later filmed her mother too.
