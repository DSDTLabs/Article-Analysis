Dudhpachare explained that this happens when the sun comes exactly over head on a specific day, in Chandrapur’s case on May 19, based on the geographical location of the place. “The phenomenon occurs due to northward and southward movement of sun,” he added. 
 
 Chandrapur city is at 19 degree 58 minute Latitude and 79 degree 18 minute longitude. Sun passes directly over this location twice every year. On its northward course, it was exactly overhead Chandrapur city at 12.08pm on Friday and the objects lost shadow for the next three minutes, he said. 
 
 In fact, the shadow falls on the object itself instead of appearing sideways, he explained and added that second such zero shadow day for Chandrapur will be on July 24 when sun will be moving southward. “There are chances that we will not be able to witness the phenomenon then as the condition could be overcast due to monsoon,” he said.
