TRICHY: Despite being a weekend, most of the multiplex in the city had limited viewers as it was the second straight weekend without any new Tamil releases hitting the  . 

 The   are on a strike since the beginning of this month against the virtual print fee charged by digital distribution companies. As a result theatres have been screening previous releases for almost a month, for which there is not much reception. 
 
 For film buffs and theatre owners, this has been yet another disappointing weekend. Theatres owners have been affected with two strikes in just a year, the last one in July when they went on strike against GST. 
 
 “Except for the two multiplexes -   and  , the rest of the theatres in the city have not been doing well in terms of running house full shows in recent years,” said S Srither, joint secretary of Tamil Nadu Theatres Owners Association, adding that the deadlock has further worsened the situation. 
 
 “Last year, movies like   2 and Mersal were the only two releases which helped rake in good sales. Apart from these, about 10 films like Vikram Vedha, Meesaiya Muruku, Aram, Aval and Theeran helped us fetch a little over the minimum break even,” he added. 
 
 “This year when we are yet to have even one film with a decent collection theatres are already at the receiving end. Many of the theatres have had to cancel their shows owing to a drop in number of viewers,” Srither said. 
 
 With limited recreational avenues in Trichy, theatres are the most preferred places for people to hang around apart from restaurants. S  , a film buff from the city, has been watching old movies online. “Though relatively new movies are available online, watching them in theatre with quality sound system is all together a different experience,” he said. 
 
 S Rajesh, a marketing professional from the city, cancelled his movie plans and instead opted an outing with his family to the butterfly park.
