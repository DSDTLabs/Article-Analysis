Kolkata: The detective department team probing social media threats to poets   and   indicated that it was a “calculated” move by a group of people and the same set of people were targeting both the poets.

 The cops have reportedly identified a person who issued rape threats to Sen and will summon him to Lalbazar once they find his local address.
 
 “We are now tracing the true identities and addresses of these people. But it is too early to speculate whether action will be taken against all of them. We have kept the legal team in the loop about our findings,” said a source. Joint CP (crime) Vishal Garg, however, said, “The probe is at a stage where we cannot issue any comment at the moment.”
 
 “It is not easy to trace the physical location of the computer to which an internet IP address has been assigned and thereby identify the computer’s user. It will thus take us some more time to complete the process,” said a source.
 
 On March 19, a 12-line poem, ‘Abhishap’, by Bandyopadhyay created a stir on social media with a Bagdora college student lodging a complaint against him alleging it hurt the religious sentiments of a section of people. It culminated with Siliguri police registering an FIR against the poet. The online threats led Bandyopadhyay to seek police protection from Lalbazar.
 
 And on Wednesday, Mandakranta Sen complained to the cyber cell after being threatened online with gang rape. Sen, who had returned her Golden Jubilee Young Writers Award from   to protest against M M Kalburgi’s murder and the Dadri lynching case, has asked for police protection.
