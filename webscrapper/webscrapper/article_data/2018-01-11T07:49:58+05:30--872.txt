CHENNAI: The Pongal Bird Count (PBC) 2018 will be held across the state from January 13 to 16. The four-day event will give birders from TN and   a chance to document bird species and count their numbers for at least 15 minutes each day and upload their observations on the eBird India portal. Participants are free to choose any site of their interest for the count.

 The event is part of a worldwide effort to document birds around the globe and to make bird watching popular and scientific. Coordinated by   and  , the result of the count will be uploaded on ebird.org , an online platform for bird watchers to register their observations in a systematic manner. “Birdwatching is beneficial for both birds as well as human beings. Seasonality, occurrence and distribution of even common birds around us is poorly known. Hence, identifying, counting birds and reporting it in a citizen science platform such as the eBird India portal can help us understand our birds better,” said P  , one of the organisers of the PBC.
 
 The PBC which began in 2015 saw birders from TN and Puducherry submitting 1,741 lists in 2017. Coimbatore, Pudukkottai, Kancheepuram, Thanjavur and   were the top five districts respectively. However, districts from central and southern TN submitted relatively fewer checklists. During the PBC 2016, more than 300 checklists were submitted daily.
 
 Out of nearly 525 species likely to occur in the region, 346 species were reported within four days of PBC 2016. During PBC 2017, each participant (178 in total) spent on an average five hours on birding. Coimbatore (53) and Kancheepuram (23) districts had the highest number of participants.
 
 The house crow was the most common resident bird appearing in 53.8% of checklists, followed by common myna (53%), black drongo (45%), large-billed crow (41%) and Indian pond-heron (39%), said Jeganathan. “The most common migrant appearing in 31.2% of checklists was barn swallow followed by bluetailed bee-eater (25%), Blyth’s reed-warbler (21%), rosy starling (13%) and common sandpiper (12%),” he added.
