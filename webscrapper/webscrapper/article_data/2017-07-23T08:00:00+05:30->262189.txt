Unlike many such helpless women, Onaatah, instead of succumbing to the societal “degradation”, fights to get her culprits behind the bar. But the pain of being an ostracized outcast weighs heavily upon her shoulders. Wherever she goes, cruel remarks and sympathetic gestures gnaw at her conscience. A journey into a remote village with its rustic simplicity and atmosphere of bonhomie compels her to walk down the aisle of attempting to wipe the scars that were imprinted on her mind and soul. Unparalleled acceptance and love that steadily erase the nightmare and prejudices she was held captive to.
