RAJAM (SRIKAKULAM): Six factors would decide India’s march to excellence – multi-tasking and  , acquiring problem solving skills, moving global, becoming lifelong learners, increasing participation of women in business, economy and education and entepreneurship, said Ch Vidyasagar Rao, Governor of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, while addressing 1,000 students of   and   and faculty members at   (the Corporate Social Responsibility arm of the  ) campus at Rajam in Srikakulam on Saturday.

 Elaborating on these six factors, the governor said, “One should acquire as many skills as they can while learning. Students should also acquire problem solving skills, which our engineering graduates need besides developing good communication skills. Further, the young citizens should move global or be prepared to work in any country or continent. Around 25 million Indians are spread across 200 countries. Fourthly, it’s imperative to become lifelong learners to succeed at the global level. After CV Raman, India hasn’t produced any Nobel prize winner and we are losing out on research and innovation. One should try to acquire knowledge beyond text books and classrooms to gain a global perspective.”
 
 “Another important fact is increasing women participation. Even though in eight out of 10 cases the top gold medal recipients in universities are girls, when it comes to joining business or teaching, a majority of women lose out. They sacrifice their brilliant career for the sake of families. We have to encourage more women to pursue their career. Survey has shown that companies employing 30 per cent and more female executives earn more profits. Finally, emerging India needs entepreneurs who will produce jobs. We want job creators, not job seekers,” averred the governor.
