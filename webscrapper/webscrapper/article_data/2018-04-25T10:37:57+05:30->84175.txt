KALABURAGI: The   stands a very good chance of winning the   assembly polls, and the high command will take a call on the next chief minister, senior party leader   said on Tuesday, indicating incumbent   may not be the automatic choice.

 Kharge said the Congress high command will choose the chief minister in consultation with the newly elected MLAs, if the party is voted to power for a second term.
 
 The Congress has consistently maintained that it is contesting the polls under the leadership of chief minister Siddaramaiah, but refrained from declaring him its candidate for the top job.
 
 Kharge’s remarks indicated that the leadership question in the Congress was far from settled.
 
 When asked if the party’s central leadership has decided on who would be the next chief minister, Kharge said “unnecessary controversy” should not be created in the run-up to the elections.
