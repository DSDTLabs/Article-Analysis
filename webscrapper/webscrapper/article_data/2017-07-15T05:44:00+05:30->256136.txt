Nagpur: Salim Shah (32), former president of BJP’s minor cell president of Katol taluka, who was thrashed by four cow vigilantes at Barasinghi on Wednesday, had to be re-admitted to a private hospital in the city later.

 Shah was discharged earlier from Mayo hospital on Thursday after which he was taken to his residence at Katol taluka.
 
 Shah was thrashed at Barasinghi after being intercepted while returning to his residence with around 15kg of meat in his scooter’s dickey from Amner in Amravati district. Four persons were arrested by the Jalalkheda police following a complaint lodged by Shah.
 
 The cops have also registered an offence against Shah for possession of the questionable meat, which he had claimed to be taking for a religious function.
 
 Shah was shifted to Mayo hospital on Wednesday after being assaulted, but taken to Katol following an early discharge on Thursday. He had to be brought back to the city in the evening after developing some pain and complications.
 
 SP (Nagpur rural) Shailesh Balkawade said the cops have been told to help Shah in getting treatment at government hospitals.
 
 In the meantime, All India Majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeem has presented a memorandum to special inspector general of police Pratapsing Patankar of Nagpur range seeking ban on Guarakshan Trust.
 
 Sayyed Aseem Ali, who represents an anti-terrorism organization, also met district collector Sachin Kurve to present him a deputation against the thrashing of Shah by the cow vigilantes.
 
 This is probably the second such incident in Vidarbha. The earlier one had taken place at Rajora in Washim district on May 26 when someone was targeted for carrying ‘beef’.
