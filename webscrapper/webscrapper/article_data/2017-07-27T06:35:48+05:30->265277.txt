KOLKATA: Water seepage due to incessant rain during the weekend could have caused the short circuit that sparked the fire in the Metro Railway substation at   and disrupted services on Tuesday evening. An inquiry committee formed by the general manager is probing the incident and is expected to submit the report shortly.

 On Tuesday, power was restored to Maidan and Rabindra Sadan stations as well as the third rail on this stretch around 11.55 pm by drawing from   and Park Street. Rakes that were stranded in this section were then hauled to the car shed. Though normal services resumed from Wednesday morning, speed restriction was imposed in the   section. Motormen slowed down on this stretch, causing a slight delay in train timings.
 
 Metro Railway chief public relations officer   said regular inspections were carried out by senior officials, who were each given a station and a section to inspect after the day's last service.
 
 “The officials inspect passenger amenities and infrastructure with special emphasis on safety and possible seepage in tunnels. The note has to be sent to the higher authority within two days and is acted upon with urgency,“ she said.
