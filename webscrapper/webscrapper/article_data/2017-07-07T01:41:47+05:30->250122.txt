MUMBAI:   can avail of   contraceptive Depo MedroxyProgestrone Acetate (DMPA) at the municipal hospitals and maternity homes from July 11. The civic body has chosen the World Population Day to roll out the new birth control option, whose inclusion in the National Family Planning has been much debated.

 BMC’s executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar said, “The quarterly dose will be given free of cost in all our teaching and peripheral hospitals and maternity homes. It is also safe for women who are breastfeeding.” A section of the medical community has protested against the inclusion of DMPA in the national programme citing its side-effects. 
 
 “It is a progesterone-based contraception and some of its known side-effects are irregular periods, weight gain, bloating and loss in bone mineral density,” said gynaecologist Dr Kiran Coelho.
