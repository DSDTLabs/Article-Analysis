Depression is going to be the next big epidemic,” said Bollywood diva   while speaking at a session on ‘Making mental wellness a boardroom priority’ on the concluding day of the   and Nasscom India Leadership Forum, in Hyderabad on Wednesday.

 Opening up about how she suffered from depression, the 32-year-old actress said that it’s okay to be vulnerable. Taking instances from her life, she explained how her mother was her biggest supporter. “Personal feel and touch, physical proximity and one-on-one interaction is important. This is something technology, in some ways, is taking away from us,” she said.
 
 Speaking about how depression at workplaces has become rampant, the   star stressed on the importance of having a psychiatrist in every organisation. “I think it is important to deal with people who experience mental illness with lot more empathy and a little more heart. Every organisation should focus on mental health and ensure that it has a counsellor or a psychiatrist coming in regularly to speak to the employees,” she said. 
 Considering that there is a lot of stigma attached to mental illness, Deepika also asked the employers not to treat employees, who are prone to the illness, differently. She stressed that such employees should not feel any different about themselves.
