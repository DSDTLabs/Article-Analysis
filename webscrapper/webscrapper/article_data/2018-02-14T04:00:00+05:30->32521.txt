Chennai: Indian Overseas Bank on Tuesday reported a wider loss of Rs 971 crore, compared to a net loss of Rs 554 crore the previous year as the public-sector lender had to set aside more money to cover its bad loans.

 On a sequential basis, the bank saw its losses narrow as it had reported a Rs 1,222.5 crore loss in the second quarter of 2017. “We hope to turn profitable exactly a year from now; in all likelihood by the third-quarter of 2018, provided external circumstances do not change. We initially had set a target of breaking even by the first quarter of 2018, but because of the NCLT process underway, we had to make higher provisioning,” said R Subramaniakumar, CEO, IOB.
 
 The bank saw interest income from its loans dip 13% to Rs 4,255 crore. Despite that the bank saw its total income rise 13% to Rs 808 crore as it earned more revenue from its non-interest income from investments, ATM networks, fees and commissions from sale of third-party products like insurance and mutual funds. For the third-quarter, non-interest income grew 12% to Rs 808 crore compared to the same period last year.
 
 “Since the markets have been sluggish, our investment income has not been as high as we would like it to be. But, we have earned a sizeable sum in insurance policies from our tie-ups with LIC, Apollo Munich, Universal Sompo and others,” said Subramaniakumar. IOB’s investment income dropped 11% to Rs 1,119 crore.
 
 Hardening of bond yields also saw IOB seeing a 14.5% reduction in revenue from treasury operations to Rs 1,261 crore from the year-ago. Corporate banking revenue was flat at Rs 2,225 crore as the bank curtailed its lending to large corporate accounts and focused more on SMEs. When it came to retail banking, IOB saw revenue drop 20% to Rs 1,465 crore.
 
 As the bank curtailed its lending, it had to pay out more for its liabilities (deposits) than it make as interest on its assets (loans). IOB’s current and savings account (CASA) ratio saw a dip to 36% this quarter, compared to 36.19% reported for the quarter of December 2016 — as the bank saw an increase in term deposits. The bank’s gross loan advances also reduced to 1.5% to Rs 1.51 lakh crore.
 
 The bank also managed to set a capital adequacy ratio of 9.74% as against the regulatory requirement of 9%.
 
 IOB had to set aside more money this quarter to cover its bad loans. Provisions against loan losses increased 17% year-over-year to Rs 1,640 crore. Compared to the previous quarter, however, the bank saw 27% lesser provisions.
 
 The public-sector bank also reported a slight improvement in its asset quality with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of loan advances at 21.95%, compared to 22.42% last year. Net NPAs improved to 13.08% from 14.32% in the year-ago.
