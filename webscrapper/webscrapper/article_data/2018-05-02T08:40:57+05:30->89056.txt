ROHTAK: A Rohtak court on Tuesday acquitted controversial godman Rampal and his two followers in a   case.

 The court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM)   acquitted Rampal and his followers Rajender and   in the case registered in 2006 while holding land shareholders Rubina, Rajender and Krishna guilty for forgery and fraud.
 
 A case was registered on the complaint of a woman, Kamla, who had accused the Rampal’s trust Bandhi Chhod Bhakti Mukti Trust of fraudulently grabbing 3.5 acres of her land.
 
 Rampal’s counsel   said the court found that the complainant Kamla had first sold the land to the trust and later lodged a false complaint against his clients for ulterior motives.
 
 Hearing the case for the past 12 years, the judge held three of the land shareholders, related to complainant Kamla, who committed forgery while selling land to Rampal’s trust, guilty. The quantum of punishment would be announced on May 7.
 
 Rampal is currently lodged in Hisar jail after being arrested for sedition and other serious offences during the violence in his ashram at Barwala near Adampur in Hisar district in November 2014.
