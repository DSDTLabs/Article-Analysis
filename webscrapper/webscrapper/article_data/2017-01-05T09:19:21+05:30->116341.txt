RAJKOT: There was no respite from   for needy people and a little relief for bank officials who continued to face anger of people for not being able to meet their money requirement on Wednesday too.

 While most people in the villages have lost hope on ATMs that are gathering dust since over a month, they did not get enough cash from the banks. 
 
 People at Virdi village of Maliya-Hatina taluka in Junagadh district locked the Saurashtra Gramin Bank’s gate when they learnt that customers were not getting cash. Police had to be called in to bring the situation under control as it threatened to turn violent.
 
 “We rushed to the spot on getting a desperate call from the bank. There was only Rs 2 lakh cash in bank. People who were standing in queue were demanding more money. Finally, bank officials gave Rs 2,000 to each person standing in the queue,’’ said K N Karangliya, police sub-inspector, Maliya-Hatiya police station. 
 
 Similarly, there was scuffle between villagers and bank officials at   in Amarapar village of the taluka.
 
 Chaotic scenes were witnessed at several banks across Saurashtra as farmers, who deposited their money received from selling farm produce, were unable to get cash to pay their labourers.
 
 In Mota Gunda village of Bhanvad taluka, frustrated villagers locked Saurashtra Gramin Bank’s staffers in the office and the bank’s gate too. Police rushed to the spot and eased the situation. 
 
 Villagers in   near Dhrol also locked the bank’s gate on failing to get money to meet their daily expenses.
