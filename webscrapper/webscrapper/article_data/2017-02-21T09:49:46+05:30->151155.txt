BARWANI: A six-month-old   cub was   at a farmland in Malwan village by the forest department officials late on Sunday. The cub had fallen into a 60-feet deep well on Sunday afternoon. 

 Sendhwa divisional forest officer (DFO) RK Rai told that the cub was saved after five hours of rescue operation.
 
 Rai said, “The cub probably with its mother was on hunt and following a prey lost balance and fell into the well surrounded by crop. Villagers noticed the cub in the well and informed range officer at 7pm. Thereafter, the rescue team rushed to the spot with all the gears.”
 
 We first cordoned off the area and put a long ladder in the well, which was having water from 35 feet, but in vain. The cub was in panic situation and had to be rescued immediately. After a while we took a cot and tied all four its corners with long ropes from backside and put it down into the well. After many attempts cub was able to sit on it and the cot was lifted very carefully by balancing all sides so that it couldn’t fall in the well again, he added.
 
 As soon cot came on the height of parapet the cub adjusted itself and climbed outside the well. It vanished in the jungle within seconds, said Rai.
 
  “We had spotted two leopards last year in camera trap. Of the duo, male leopard entered in a villager’s house and we caught it. It was released in national park area of   range under Khandwa forest circle. The female leopard frequently moves in the junction area of three forest ranges- Dhanora, Sendhwa and Warla. She has now two cubs and by looking at the activity of the rescued one, it seems that growth of the cubs is quite amazing and they have adjusted with the area nicely,” he said.
