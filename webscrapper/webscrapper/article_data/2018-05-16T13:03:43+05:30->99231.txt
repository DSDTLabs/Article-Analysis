VADODARA: Twenty-three-year-old   would have drowned in   near   on Sunday, had he not been rescued by an NCC cadet from the city.

 Bhargsetu Sharma, who is also an animal rescuer, had gone to Rasalpur for picnic with her rescue team. An avid swimmer, when Sharma was crossing the river, she heard people shouting from the riverbank that two boys had drowned.
 
 “A local boy jumped into the river and saved one of them, but Badal was about to drown. I saw a family having a rubber tube and with the help of it I went into the deep waters and brought him out,” said Sharma, who recently finished her graduation in zoology from MS University.
 
 Sharma said when Badal, who lives on Waghodiya Road, was brought out, he was not breathing and his heart beats had stopped. “I gave him CPR for a few minutes and tried to unlock his jaws using my hands,” she said, adding that after several attempts he gained consciousness. “But I had to keep slapping him so that he would not become unconscious again,” Sharma said.
 
 Sharma, who aims to join  , told TOI that coincidentally on the same morning she had received rescue instructions from her officials in NCC which proved helpful in rescuing the man.
