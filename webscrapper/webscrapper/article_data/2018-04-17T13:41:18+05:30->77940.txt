SURAT: The city police suspect that the deceased 11-year-old girl could be from   and a victim of revenge killing. Police believe that many migrants despite having settled down in Surat never really forget their old enmity.

 A senior police officer said one of the DGPs in the state, who is from Odisha, said from the features of the girl she seems to be from his state. 
 
 Pandesara, Udhna, Limbayat and Unn in Surat city have sizeable population of people from Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Maharashtra and other states. 
 
 They work here in local industries. Majority of them have been living in the city for years yet many among them never forget their past enmities, the police said. 
 
 “Someone who’s seething with anger for years together commits the crime when he gets an opportunity to settle his score with his enemy,” said a senior police officer adding that a man from Odisha could have committed the crime against someone close to him to settle a grudge. The criminal could be living in the city. He may have abducted the girl and tortured her before killing her. Such brutal rape and murder cases have been rare in the city, he added. 
 
 Police commissioner Satish Sharma said, “We had one such case in 2016. But it is rare where identity of the child victim of rape and murder had remained a mystery. We are looking at all aspects and probabilities to ascertain the identity of the girl.” 
 
 On Monday, Odisha DGP R P Sharma ordered all the superintendents of police (SPs) in the state to collect information on the missing girls in their jurisdictions. 
 
 Sources also said that the police have got the closed circuit television footages from   Residence, the only big building near the spot where the girl was found.
