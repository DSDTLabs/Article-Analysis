Ponda: The sarpanch of Curti-Khandepar village panchayat, Rukma Khandeparkar and some panchas along with a few villagers inspected the ongoing work of the sewage processing unit at Housing Board at Curti on Sunday. The panchayat swung into action after villagers brought it to their notice during the gram sabha on Sunday that work was going on despite the stop order issued by the panchayat on March 21.  “The Housing Board area is densely populated and the residents do not want the plant in their vicinity”, said a villager. The sarpanch instructed the officials of the Sewage Infrastructure Development Corporation of Goa Ltd not to continue with the work since locals do not want it there. Chandrakant Holkar, a resident of Mestawada, threatened that he would sleep in front of the machinery if the corporation attempted to resume work.
