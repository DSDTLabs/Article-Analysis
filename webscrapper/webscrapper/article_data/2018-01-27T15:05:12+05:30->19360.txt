BENGALURU: By retaining at least one key player each - four teams have retained the maximum three and a couple of others two - the eight IPL franchises appear to have a clear-cut plan ahead of the 11th season. That plan will come to fruition over the weekend when 578 players - including 16 marquee players - go under the hammer at the IPL auction here in the city.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Most teams have apparently earmarked a significant sum for the Right To Match (RTM) option which is likely to be an expensive affair.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 Likewise, players like Krunal Pandya, Kieron Pollard ( ), Shikar Dhawan, Rashid Khan ( ), Kuldeep Yadav, Manish Pandey (Kolkata Knight Riders),   ( ), David Miller and Hashim Amla (Kings XI Punjab), Ajinkya Rahane (Rajasthan Royals) and Faf Du Plessis ( ) will be on their radar.
 
 
 
 
 With most of the best in the business up for auction, franchisees will face a problem of plenty, but star batsmen like Ben Stokes, Chris Gayle, Yuvraj Singh, Joe Roots, Ajinkya Rahane, Evin Lewis, KL Rahul, Manish Pandey, Robin Uthappa, Brendon McCullum, Dwayne Smith, Kane Williamson and Shikhar Dhawan will ensure a bidding war.
 
 
 
 
 Teams like   and Rajasthan Royals will have to build the bowling department from scratch and will look for an experienced spearhead. Also each of the franchisee will look at roping in a bowler who has mastered the death overs. Rashid Khan, Mitchell Starc, Andrew Tye, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harbhajan Singh, Kagiso Rabada, Kuldeep Yadav and Chris Woakes will be among the top draws.
 
 
 
 
 Headlined by Ben Stokes, multi-utility players will be the showstoppers at the auction. From Dwayne Bravo to Kieron Pollard to R Ashwin and Glenn Maxwell, the options in this category will be plenty.
