 The accused,  , also stole one Swift Dzire and two Altos and sold their parts. He had a master key for a Honda City with which he used to unlock the cars.
 
 A team led by SHO Kirti Nagar, Anil Sharma, tracked down Karan after they discovered that the modus operandi in some of his previous cases were similar, said  , DCP (west).
 
 The team found that Karan, who has 37 cases in south and west Delhi, had a well-oiled operation involving spare parts and scraps at his disposal.
 
 He would approach a parked car, use the master key to unlock it and would remove the electronic mechanism to start the engine. He then used to sell these cars in the neighbouring states at two third of the original price. 
 
 If he managed to open the locks of some other cars, he would get the vehicle dismantled and sell their parts to mechanics at half the market price.
 
 While the engines and CNG kits were shipped to sellers in old Delhi and UP, other parts went to known receivers. Even the nuts and bolts were sold to scrap dealers.
 
 Police said Karan would employ sources near residential colonies to tip him off about new cars. During interrogation, he disclosed that he had dismantled more than 20 cars in the past few months at a godown in Meerut.
 
 Karan would lift two or three vehicles in less than two hours and then flee to Haryana or UP overnight and reduce them to scrap. He then sold the dismantled parts, police said.
 
 There was a strong nexus between mechanics, auto-lifters and receivers. Police said sedans are the most sought after cars, followed by SUVs that are usually sold at anything between Rs 8-10 lakh each.
