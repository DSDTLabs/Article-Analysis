CHANDIGARH: A two-member Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team from Delhi on Friday met   in Jalandhar in connection with the probe into the assassination of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) Punjab vice-president Brig Jagdish Gagneja (retd) last year.

 CBI joint director Y C Modi, along with his local team, held meeting with Punjab Police chief DGP Suresh Arora, Jalandhar commissioner Arpit Shukla and IG (special task force) Nilabh Kishor. The meeting took place at   (PAP) headquarters.
 
 After Punjab Police had failed to make a headway in the probe, the case was transferred from state police to the CBI.
 
 Sources in Punjab Police said that CBI had already taken possession of all evidence in the case, including the crucial   that had emerged from the neighbourhood of the crime spot. The footage was sent to Gujarat to ascertain the identity of the accused but the results were not encouraging.
 
 The Punjab Police had registered a case with charges of murder as well as under the   against unknown persons in Jalandhar.
 
 Arora had been under fire last year ever since Pathankot terror attack lapses were pointed out by the parliamentary committee report, followed by assassinations of Gagneja and Namdhari sect matriarch Mata Chand Kaur, Hindu sect leader Amit Sharma in Ludhiana and murder bid on Sikh preacher Ranjit Dhadrianwale, besides several sacrilege cases.
