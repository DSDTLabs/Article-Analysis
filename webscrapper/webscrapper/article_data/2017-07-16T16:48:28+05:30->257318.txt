Kareena Kapoor Khan, who was present at nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar’s new book launch titled ‘Pregnancy Notes- Before, During and After’ looked ravishing with all the post   weight loss. The new mommy has been giving us goals for everything from   to fitness by eating right. Kareena, who has been following the nutritionist’s diet plan, feels that she has been eating basic home food and nothing that is out of the box. 

  
  
 
 When asked about her diet, Kareena said, “In fact, it is easier for common people to eat clean. I think what we as Indians eat —home cooked food — is completely normal. I don’t like going to parties or restaurants much. I rather enjoy watching a good movie and a home cooked meal which keeps me healthy and happy. How difficult is that. If that can help you lose weight why bother about expensive berries. I am a true blue punjabi at heart and love eating Indian food. In fact Rujuta’s diet helped me sail smooth during my pregnancy. It was so easy that maybe I should do that again.”
