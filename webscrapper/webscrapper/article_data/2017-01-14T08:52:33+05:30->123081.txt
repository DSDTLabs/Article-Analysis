NAGPUR: Following TOI’s report on coated manjas being sold freely on leading online shopping portals, e-commerce portal   has removed the deadly thread from listings on its Indian website. 

 Four days back, TOI had reported that different types of coated manjas were available online despite the National Green Tribunal’s order banning all coated kite-flying threads. Taking a lead in this regard, Amazon.in has stopped sales of manjas. “Amazon.in supports wildlife and environment protection efforts. We have informed all the sellers about the NGT’s order and are taking down all such products from our website. Currently, as per the court’s guidelines, only certain type of cotton threads are available for kite-flying,” an Amazon spokesperson told TOI.
 
 Apart from Amazon.in,   with description stating ‘Extreme sharp nine-cord manja for those who never compromise’ was available on ebay.in. As per the information available on the site, 16 such manja reels were sold on the site for Rs320 each from December 23, 2016, to January 9 this year.
 
 People   ( ), which had filed a plea in NGT, plans to raise the issue before appropriate forum. In December last year, NGT imposed an interim nationwide ban on use of coated 'manja' for flying  , saying the sharp string posed a danger to humans, animals and birds.
