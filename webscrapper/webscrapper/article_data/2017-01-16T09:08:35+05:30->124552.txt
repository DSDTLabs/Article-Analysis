AHMEDABAD: While Uttarayan was enjoyed by lakhs of citizens, celebrations also claimed a number of winged victims in the city. Several city-based NGOs put the number of birds   to over 1,500, though actual figure might be much higher, said activists.

 “Flying kites is not a bad activity, but while using the manja, we inadvertently cause injuries to birds, especially in morning and evening hours. Every year, we receive a number of birds with irreparable damage to their wings. Apart from common birds like pigeon, dove, parakeet and kites, we also get injured birds such as owl and migratory birds such as ibis,” said   of Jivdaya Trust. Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) attended to 40 bird rescue calls including one where they had to use a snorkel to rescue a kite tangled in manja near Satadhar crossroads.
  A veterinary doctor and a surgeon from New Zealand extended their services at a camp organized by a city-based   at   where over 450 birds were provided treatment, said officials.
 
 In Naranpura, Mirambika Jain Sangh members carried out a ‘funeral’ procession of 23 birds on Sunday. Bindesh Shah, organizer of the event, said that the purpose was to create awareness about the killer manja and motivate people to shun such violence.
