Surat:  

 Police booked Kanu Kishore Patel, his brother Gandalal, Pratik Patel and Sudhanshu for stealing the valuables from Dhanlakshmi Enterprise. The alleged theft was carried out between October 22, 2016 and August 1, 2017. Textile unit owner Manoj Patel in his complaint alleged that the accused took the products from the unit without his knowledge. Police investigation revealed that Manoj had entered into an understanding with accused Kanu and others to do business and later some financial dispute cropped up between them.
 
 They could not pay taxes and bills for various government services and this led to sealing of the unit by the civic body. Manoj opened the unit on August 1 and found to his surprise machinery and material missing. He lodged a police complaint. Police have started to examine CCTV footages of neighbouring units as a part of their investigation.
