KOLKATA: The subways at two important south Kolkata intersections - Jadavpur 8B bus stand and   - which had been in limited use despite being built several years ago - will now see optimum use. After an initiative by   - which has adopted them as model subways to ensure safety of commuters - civic volunteers and cops are now literally "forcing" passengers and pedestrians to take these subways. 

 At Jadavpur 8B bus stand, the entire risk-zone has been barricaded, practically denying any chance to pedestrians to cross over. Civic volunteers are holding ropes during peak hours and leading everyone to the subway. Even buses are being asked to drive up to Sukanta Setu crossing and then take a U-turn back to the terminus.
 
 "We have begun our subway drive with the Jadavpur 8B subway for a number of reasons. On one side, it has the   and the station and on the other the entire Jadavpur locality, the government bus stand and the market. There are thousands - especially those headed to the railway station - who cross this point," said an officer.
 
 Work for an overhaul of the subway is also on after Kolkata Police prodded   to renovate it. 
 
 "It's now going to take me longer to cross the small stretch of road. But I agree this will ensure greater pedestrian safety," said Ayan Sinha, an IT executive. Sukti Dey, a daily commuter from Subhasgram and a JU student, said: "It's an abrupt decision taken without adding any infrastructure and ensuring security for the women."
 
 "The Tollygunge subway is one subway that should have been one of the busiest in the city with thousands of Metro commuters using this crossing. There are auto stands and functional bus and tram depots. The idea here is the same - we have to initially force pedestrians to take the subway," said police.
