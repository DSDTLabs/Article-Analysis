Coimbatore: Members of the Joint Action Committee of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organisations - Government Employees’ Organisations (Jactto-Geo) on Saturday took out a protest march in the city, demanding withdrawal of contributory pension scheme and implementation of the seventh pay commission for college and university teachers.

 Members of 72 workers’ unions under Jactto-Geo marched from Women’s Polytechnic College to VOC Ground. They said they chose Saturday for protest as they did not want to disrupt exams and cause inconvenience to students.
 
 Pointing out that the state government had promised to bring back the old pension scheme, the protesters lamented that it was yet to be done. “We want the government to withdraw contributory pension scheme immediately and implement the old pension scheme as promised in the election manifesto,” said T Veeramani, president of Tamil Nadu Government Collegiate Teachers Association (TNGCTA).
 
 He also urged the government to bring the college and university teachers under the ambit of the seventh pay commission and settle dues to government employees who were brought under it after a long delay. TNN
