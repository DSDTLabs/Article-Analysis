VADODARA: Former   MLA from Vadodara, Upendrasinh Gohil, joined   party on Friday in presence of Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Bharatsinh Solanki. Gohil, a three-time MLA, joined Congress with some party workers at GPCC headquarters in Ahmedabad. He claimed that BJP policies were against common people and he doesn’t trust anyone in BJP now. 

 Gohil, who was minister of state for environment in 1995-97, had quit BJP in 2015. He was unhappy with the party’s ticket distribution for district panchayat polls. The 63-year-old leader was chairman of Baroda Dairy and held posts in different co-operative bodies. Gohil was earlier a member of the Congress party but he contested the assembly polls from Vadodara (rural) in 1995 and won the seat.
 
 In 1999, Gohil contested the   polls for Vadodara seat on NCP ticket but lost the election. Gohil then joined BJP and contested assembly polls in Savli in 2002. He won the polls. Gohil later contested and won the Vadodara (rural) seat in 2007 assembly polls. 
 
 In 2012, Gohil lost from Savli after BJP’s then rebel leader Ketan Inamdar contested as an independent and won the seat. He is considered to be a vocal leader who doesn’t necessarily fall in line with party’s diktats.
