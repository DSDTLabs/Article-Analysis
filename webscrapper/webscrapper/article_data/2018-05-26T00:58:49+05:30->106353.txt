NEW DELHI: Delhi Police finally got to the bottom of who had called in twice about bombs placed in the   office at  . On Friday, the cops arrested the man who admitted to making the hoax   because he was angry at his application for a passport having been rejected. Police depended on the clue about the caller having light-coloured hair to nab Rukshar Ahmed.

 Ahmed, a tailor from Kanpur, thrice applied for a new passport, but was rejected each time since he already possessed one. His passport is in the custody of his father, who confiscated it after Ahmed was deported from Australia in 2016 for overstaying. Though he now wished to go to the US, his father refused to return his passport.
 
 Ahmed came to the capital, stayed at a friend’s house in  's Chauhan Bangar and applied for a duplicate copy, providing a Delhi address. “When his applications were rejected, Ahmed decided to cause trouble by threatening to blow up the passport office,” revealed  , DCP (North-east). “He made calls from PCOs, presuming he could not be identified that way.”
 
 Investigations revealed that at both the PCOs, the tailor used SIM cards procured by submitting forged documents and the ID cards of two housewives. Police sources said the first call, received on Sunday, was tracked to Seelampur in northeast Delhi. The second, on Tuesday, was made from an illegal calling booth in Gandhi Nagar.
 
 The first call came from a number, *****3413 which was registered in a woman’s name. She denied all knowledge about the call and police registered a case. Tracking the call, police questioned Riasuddin, the owner of a PCO booth in Seelampur. When he couldn’t give a satisfactory reply, he was arrested. But later Riasuddin recalled the caller as having light-coloured hair. During a door-to-door search, the cops located Ahmed in the area.
