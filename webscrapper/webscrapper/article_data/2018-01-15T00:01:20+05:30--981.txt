 V K Bindulal Babu, who was also killed in Saturday’s copter crash, had a miraculous escape during the fire at Bombay High on July 27, 2005. He floated for five-and-a-half hours before he was rescued. A vessel had then collided with the offshore Bombay High north platform, 160km west of the city’s coast, causing a major fire that claimed 11 lives.
 
 Babu, who hailed from Chenathunadu near Chalakudy, settled in Mumbai two decades ago. He is survived by wife Dr Shiny Babu, daughter Vibisha, a Plus Two student and son Susant, a Class III student.
