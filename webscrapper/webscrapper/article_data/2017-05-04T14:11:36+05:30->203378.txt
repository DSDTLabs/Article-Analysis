 Parrikar also put the onus for the tensions on media reports. “Newspaper reports can be misleading...Karnataka should have done detailed due diligence,” he said.

 In his letter, Siddaramaiah had claimed that Azgaonkar’s statement had created fear among lamanis, who have been living with dignity and pride in Goa for generations, imbibing the language and culture of the state and contributing to its growth and development.
 
 “Goa is a vibrant melting pot of various national and international cultures, where people belonging to various backgrounds have a long history of living together in harmony and peace, without losing their native identities,” Parrikar said in his letter to Siddaramaiah.
 
 The chief minister went on to state that he had an “uncompromising sense of moral and administrative responsibility towards ensuring peaceful co-existence and prosperity of every Goan, which invariably includes every member of the lamani community”.
