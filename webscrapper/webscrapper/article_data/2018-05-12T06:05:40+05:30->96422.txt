AHMEDABAD: The roads and buildings committee of   has decided to recover Rs 24 lakh from Sun Builders, who had caused structural damage to the boundary wall at   hall while constructing a building nearby. 

 The committee, which met on Friday, has also decided that government agencies supplying tar to contractors for road works will have to send one copy of the bill directly to the   and another copy be given to the contractor.
 
 Jatin Patel, the chairman of the committee, said the boundary wall of the premises housing the Deendayal hall was damaged when a cellar was being built at a nearby plot. The AMC had taken an affidavit from the builder promising to reimburse the cost of rebuilding the wall. The Pandit Deendayal Upadhaya Hall is the only big corporation hall in the New West Zone.
 
 Patel said two AMC engineers and engineer representing the builder surveyed the damage and it was decided that a bill of Rs 24 lakh would be raised and the money recovered from the builder. The committee on Friday approved to sum involved.
 
 About the tar bills, Patel said they had earlier found that contractors would buy less tar from IOCL, HPCL or   and raised bills for higher amounts. This meant that contractors would use less tar on the building the road. "To check this, it has been decided companies from where the tar is bought will have to send a copy of the bill raised for the contractor to the AMC. This will be verified when the contractor presents the bill for work."
 
 Patel added that to make sure the tar is received in time, even if the tar was to be bought from IOCL according to the contract, if the IOCL plant is not operational, the contractor can procure the tar from HPCL or BPCL instead.
