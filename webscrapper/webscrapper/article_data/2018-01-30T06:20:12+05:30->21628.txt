KOCHI: Members of   community continue to face social stigma despite efforts of the state government to incorporate them into the mainstream. 

 The social justice department had allotted fund to offer   to five transgender people in each district to make them self-sufficient. However, no driving school has come forward expressing willingness to take up the task in  .
 
 The fund for the initiative was allotted last year, but social justice officials continue to wait for the mercy of the driving schools.
 
 "I have spoken to some driving schools. But they refused to provide driving lessons to transgender people. We are hoping that some driving school will come forward," said  , district officer of the social justice department.
 
 A driving school in the district had shown interest when tender was invited for the project. But later, they backed out saying that they were afraid of transgender people. 
 
 "The driving school official said that he was scared of transgender people. Transgenders are hapless people as they are deprived of support of family or other," said an official in the social justice department.
 
 The department has to implement the project at any cost. Following the persistent request from higher officials, a driving school has agreed to give driving lessons to transgenders. "They said they would come and meet the district officer this week. But so far no one has come to meet the officer," the official added. The department has already identified five transgender people who would be taught driving lessons. The department had allotted Rs 6,000 per person for providing driving lessons.
