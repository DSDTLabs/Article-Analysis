Kunchacko Boban’s recent characters have been poles apart in terms of characterisation — be it the nurse in Take Off, an estate owner in   or a district collector in Diwanji Moola Grand Prix. 

 For his next, Varnyathil Aashanka… Athu Thaan Aleyo Ithu, the actor will be seen as a ruffian named Kowta Shivan.
  The movie’s director   tells us, “He doesn’t smile at all in the film; that alone should make it stand apart from the characters he has played in his career so far. Nor does he have a love interest. It’s a makeover for him in all regards; he’s grown out a beard, has cropped hair, and walks around like a hooligan.”
 
 The film, set in Thrissur city and its suburbs, also has Suraj Venjaramoodu, who represents a common man. Rachana Narayanankutty plays his wife, a saleswoman in a textile shop. Shivan’s gang comprises characters played by Chemban Vinod, Shine Tom Chacko and Manikandan.
 
 On the plot, Sidharth says, “The story is about what transpires between Shivan’s gang and Suraj’s character over a span of two to three days. It’s a take on modern day Kerala — the policies of the government, the mindset of the people and how that reflects on the choices they make.”
 The movie, which is scripted by popular theatre writer Thrissur Gopalji, is expected to hit theatres in August.
