JAISALMER: The police team, which had gone to Jammu & Kashmir in search of a   girl who had allegedly eloped with a youth and converted to Islam, failed to locate her.

 The 18-year-old girl, Ritu Khandelwal, was working with a youth from J&K at a coffee shop in Barmer. On March 16, she left home claiming that she was going to Ahmedabad. However, when she did not reach Ahmedabad, her uncle Kundan Khandelwal lodged a missing person complaint.
 
 Meanwhile, the couple had allegedly fled to J&K and filed a petition seeking security at the Jammu & Kashmir High Court. The Barmer police also received an order, dated February 20, from the high court to provide security to the couple on March 22.
 
 As per HC documents, Ritu Khandelwal, 18, converted to Islam of her own will and became Zeenab. Police also received a copy of the marriage registration certificate in which Gulzar Ahmad Khan has been mentioned as her husband.
 
 The documents show that she had converted to Islam on December 27 last year and married Khan on December 30 following Islamic rituals. However, the woman had continued to live with her parents until March 16. The couple then approached the high court, seeking security and received a direction to the police to assist them.
 
 Barmer SP Gagandeep Singhal said the woman’s parents filed a missing complaint on March 19. “A team was sent to record the statements of the couple,” he said.
