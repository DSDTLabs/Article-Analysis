 Reportedly, "I hated all of it - the interviews, the red carpets. I used to get to the end of a red carpet and start crying - I felt so uncomfortable," Mulligan said. "It took a lot out of me and it was an alien environment that I felt completely out of kilter with. These days it's all fun, that's the only way to take it. Something like that would never scare me now in the way it did then," she added.
