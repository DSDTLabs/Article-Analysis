Mumbai:For years, Bandra’s Anjuman Islam Dr Mohammed Ishaq Jamkhanawala Girls High School and Junior College had just three toilets for its 2,600 students. The girls would hesitate to drink water to avoid using the stinking toilets. This will change soon.

 On Saturday, Mukhtar Abbas  , Union minister for minority affairs, inaugurated 39 toilets in the three-storey school building.
 
 “We reach school at 7.30 in the morning and leave for home around 1pm. The toilets were so bad that we would not drink water and were often keen to reach home,” said  , a Class IX student.
 
 Naqvi, who was in the city on Friday to inaugurate the toilets as well as drinking water facilities at the school, said toilets help stem dropout rate among girl students. He added his government was committed to empowering minorities with Three Es—education, employment and empowerment—and three Ts—teachers, toilets and tiffins. “Last year, my ministry gave Rs 1.7 crore in scholarships, 60% of which went to girls. Our Begum Hazrat Mahal scholarship is 100% for girls. Minority girls and women should take benefit of scholarships and skill development schemes,” said Naqvi.
 
 The toilets were built by NGO Yuva Unstoppable and Zafar Sareshwala’s education movement Taalim O Tarbiyat.
