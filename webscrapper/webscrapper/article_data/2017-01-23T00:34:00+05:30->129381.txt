Bhopal: Ruling at abnormally high price, good production of pulses has led to a decline in prices bringing back cheers on face of middle class. 

 Widely consumed tuar nosedived to Rs 60 to 75 a kg in wholesale market depending on its variety. Last year, it was sold at Rs 170 per kg in wholesale and crossed even Rs 200 mark in retail. 
 
 At grocery shop, it varies from Rs 65 to Rs 85 a kg, said  , a wholesaler in at Hanumanganj grain market.
 
 Urad dal has gone down to Rs 75 to Rs 80 in wholesale market, which was sold at Rs 160 a kg. The price in retail market goes up from Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg depending on variety of the pulse. Similarly, price of masoor has also gone down from Rs 80 a kg at wholesaler to Rs 55 to Rs 60.
 
 Good harvest has led to decline in prices of major pulses, Wadhwani said. After unprecedented increase in tuar rate last year, farmers covered more area under cultivation of pulses.
 
 In Madhya Pradesh, pulses cultivation went up by 50% from 4 lakh hectares to 6 lakh hectares last year.
 
 Agriculture department sources said, “Area of cultivation of long duration tuar went up as many farmers opted for tuar instead of soyabean.”
 
 “Many farmers preferred pulses like urad, moong and even maize over soya in last kharif season. A good output has resulted into decline in prices,” sources said. In fact, price of most vegetables mellowed and have come down much these days. 
 
 Vegetables, including potato, onions, tomatoes and all green vegetables are being sold at low price because of good production.
