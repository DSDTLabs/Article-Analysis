PUNE: Sixty-seven new houses in   will have residents from April 2 when chief minister   will hand them over to the survivors of the 2014 landslide. They have been living in temporary sheds in the village at   in the district. 

 The new houses were designed by experts from College of Engineering Pune. A third party audit has been conducted for the construction, officials said. The new site was approved by the Geographical Survey of India. 
 
 Property cards will be given to the beneficiaries. They will have the name of the government and the villagers and will state the conditions. They will not be able to lease out the houses or sell the house without the collector’s permission.
 
 A devastating landslide on July 30, 2014 killed 151 Malin residents. After rescue operations concluded, the government proposed the survivors’ rehabilitation and the work was initiated to construct not only houses for the survivors but also provide all other facilities to the villagers as the entire hamlet was buried.
 
 The administration looked for a site for temporary shelters and an alternate site for rehabilitation, the administration finally zeroed in on an eight acre land at Amade close to the village. 
 
 SDO   told TOI that the cost of each tenement was Rs 8 lakh. The government had allocated Rs 2 lakh while the rest were garnered from CSR initiatives and society funds while beneficiaries paid Rs 10,000.
 
 Gram panchayat member Tukaram Lembe said they were happy they could move in. “The administration has constructed good houses. Even if there has been a wait, the structures are strong,’’ he told TOI.
