NEW DELHI:   accused the government of acting like a “Super Big Brother” to intrude people’s privacy and claimed that the information and broadcasting ministry had floated tender for snooping tools/software to monitor the social media.

 
  spokesman   said: “It is the habitual, perennial, repetitive, and ingrained tendency of this government to act as a ‘Super Big Brother’ and to watch you and intrude every aspect of your life, body, and every aspect of your privacy.”
 
 He added, “We find a very curious Rs 42-crore tender under which bids are invited from private agencies. This is the worst example of using the taxpayers’ money to   on them. The tender is for so-called social media communication hub creation”.
 
 Singhvi said the tender officially talks of getting a software to try and create a platform which will be deployed in the private data centre to not only listen to the standard digital channels which are listed but to consolidate them and converge them. The Congress spokesman said that in the entire 66-page tender, there is not a single safeguard.
 
 He said that in four years “we have seen how exponentially the   government has been violating privacy”.
 
 Singhvi said that several instances like Namo App and Aadhaar data leak had made it quite evident that the Centre is violating the privacy of citizens.
