AGRA: Decades-old practice among students to attach currency notes to   in their bid to “bribe” evaluators seems not to have lost its appeal among millennials. Students appearing in this year’s   exams have used it generously. 
 
  Evaluators in Mathura chanced upon quite a few currency notes stapled with answer sheets of classes X and XII students who also wrote interesting pleas to grant them “passing marks”.
  
  Some students have also highlighted their family plights to give an emotional twist to their pleas, said a teacher. One student wrote a number of Urdu and Hindu couplets, concluding that he “will be greatly under debt if given passing marks”. Another one detailed on his life’s various problems which didn’t allow him enough time to study.
  
  Neena Srivastava, Secretary, UP Board, said, “We can’t stop any student from doing such things. But teachers will not be lured by such bribes and they will go entirely by merit.” She added that the entire evaluation process is being conducted under   cameras.
  
  The evaluation exercise was started on March 17. So far, over 40 lakh copies have been evaluated, said the secretary. A total of 248 centres are designated across the state for evaluation and more than 5.5 crore copies of classes X and XII students are being checked by 1.46 lakh teachers.
  
  Results of   exams this year are expected early in the third week of April to facilitate further admission for students.
