Ever since the news of him being conferred the   broke on Republic Day,   has been flooded with congratulatory calls and messages. However, the ace   confesses to be still coming to terms with the fact that he’s been bestowed with the country’s fourth highest civilian honour. 

 Ask him what it feels like to be able to use the pre-fix ‘Padma Shri’ before his name, and the   boy bursts out, “I am extremely happy to hear about the announcement. I would like to thank the Government of India for conferring me with the Padma Shri.” 
 
 Last year, Kidambi won four   titles — Indonesia, Australia, Denmark and France, back-to-back and became the first Indian and the fifth shuttler in the world to achieve the feat in a calendar year. Today, fondly identified with the moniker ‘Super Srikanth’ among his fans world over, the Telugu boy’s unparalleled feat made him a deserving winner no doubt. He believes this honour will motivate young shuttlers. 
 
 “I would like to thank my fans for all the support they have given me, throughout. To the badminton players of the country, I would like to wish them best of luck and tell them to keep working hard. This is an amazing time for badminton in India,” says the elated World No 3.
 
 The 24-year-old who pulled out of the ongoing Indonesian Masters due to injury is confident of making a comeback at the Indian Open lined up in the coming weeks. He has set his sights on the Commonwealth Games scheduled to be held in Australia in April. 
 
 “My aim is to stay fit and stay on top of my game and aim for the big championships this year. The Commonwealth, Asian Games and the world tour are on top of my priority list,” he says signing off.
