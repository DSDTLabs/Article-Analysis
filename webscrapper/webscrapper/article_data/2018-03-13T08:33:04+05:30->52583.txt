BENGALURU: After the cabinet cleared the proposal to give   its own flag last week, the government will send it to the Centre. Sources in the chief minister’s office told TOI the proposal may be sent either late Monday or Tuesday.

 The Centre, specifically the ministry of home affairs, will be requested to look into amendments in the Flag Code, 2002 and the schedule of Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950.
 
 The nine-member committee, which looked into a flag for Karnataka, said in its report that   has, through Section 8 of the Emblems and Names Act, already empowered the Centre to add any state flag in the schedule of the act.
 
 “There is no prohibition for a state to hoist its own flag,” the committee noted, adding that the Centre should be able to recognise the Karnataka flag by making suitable changes and issuing an official gazette formalising it.
