NEW DELHI: Finance minister   said on Saturday that it may be tough to privatise state-run banks as it requires an amendment to the law and a large political consensus. 

 Demands for privatising state-run banks have gathered momentum after the Rs 11,300 crore fraud triggered in Punjab National Bank allegedly by jewellery czars   and  . Several industry leaders such as Adi Godrej, Uday Kotak and Rashesh Shah have backed privatisation of state run banks.
 
 "All I can say is that a lot of people have started expressing this view but this involves a very large political consensus because this will also involve an amendment to the law and the act itself and my impression is that Indian political opinion in Parliament still may not find favour with this idea itself," said Jaitley at the Economic Times Global Business summit. He was critical about the role of bank managements and their failure to check frauds and build up of bad debt.
