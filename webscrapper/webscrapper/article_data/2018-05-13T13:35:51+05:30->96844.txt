MADURAI: An expert team from the   (IIT) Madras on Saturday assisted the idol wing police to inspect a panchaloha idol at the   temple in Dindigul district, which was detected with misappropriations in its casting. 

 While the IIT team is led by   of the department of metallurgy, idol wing police is led by inspector general A G Pon Manickavel.
 
 The inspection has been necessitated after the chief sculptor,   and former executive officer (EO) of the Palani temple K K Raja were recently arrested for manipulation of the metals used in the casting of the idol, which is known as the abshisheka murthy. The duo were later granted conditional bail.
 
 The panchaloha idol, which is a mixture of five metal alloys - gold, silver, copper, brass and lead - of sacred significance was made in 2004 after the older and original navapashana idol was getting damaged due to continuous anointing during temple rituals. Recently, the idol wing police detected misappropriations in the casting, and Muthaiah Sthapathi who was commissioned to cast the idol and Raja, the then EO of the temple were arrested.
 
 At first, the idol wing police was handed over the investigation of the case, which was subsequently given to the CB-CID and then again to the idol wing following court intervention.
 
 The IIT experts have been roped in to ascertain the composition of the different idols and the quantity of metals used. 
 
 Apart from the abhisheka murthy, the idol used for parading, the utsava murthy, idols in the Palani Periyanayagi Amman temple and others belonging to the temple will also be inspected. 
 
 The team also questioned the present executive officer of the temple R Selvaraj and manager Uma Devi, who were working in the temple when the controversial idol was commissioned. 
 
 Idol wing ADSP Raja said that investigations would continue on Sunday also. All panchaloha idols of the temple, including those that are not used for worship, would be inspected by the experts.
