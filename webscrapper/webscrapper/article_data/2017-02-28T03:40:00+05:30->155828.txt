Ghaziabad: A 45-year-old man was found dead in his   car on NH-24 near Dundahera in   in Ghaziabad under mysterious circumstances on Monday morning.

 Darshan Lal was a property dealer and lived in New Delhi’s Arvind Nagar.
 
 Prajyant Tyagi, inspector of  , said, “We received a call in the morning from a passerby who found the man lying unconscious in the car with the window open. He was reclining in the driver’s seat which was pushed back. He was dead but there were no marks of any injury or physical abuse on his body.”
 
 A bottle of alcohol, a glass, used condom and a bra have been recovered from his car. Going by the position of the car, the police assume he was driving towards Delhi.
 
 According to the police, excessive consumption of alcohol could have been the cause of his death. 
 
 The body has been sent for postmortem and the report is awaited.
 
 Neeraj Kumar, SHO of Vijaynagar police station, said, “The presence of alcohol, a used condom and a woman’s undergarment indicate that the victim have had sexual intercourse in the car. This increases the risk of foul play too as his woman companion could have made him drink something, but all these are mere assumptions at the moment. The victim could have also died of any natural causes such as a heart attack but all of this can only be confirmed after seeing the postmortem report and further investigation.”
 
 However, Tyagi, ïnvestigating officer, said, “His family members are unable to comment but they said he had gone to bathe in the Ganga. He was also found wearing shorts and a T-shirt, which lend credence to the version.”
