Mumbai: In a first, a   from the BMC-run Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General ( ) Hospital in   has been asked to explain why hundreds of blood units could not be utilized within their shelf life under his watch between 2009 and 2016. 

 According to RTI information, the hospital’s blood bank discarded 2,246 units of blood in a span of seven years.
 
 The Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) has issued a   to Dr Jadhav Navnath Nivrutti, who was holding the charge of the blood bank all these years, and has asked him to furnish a response within a week’s time. 
 
 The MMC has also sought an explanation over discrepancy in reporting figures of blood collection and expiry that came to light after an RTI was filed by Chetan Kothari.
 
 Blood banks have to report their collection and expiry figures to the   (MDACS). “The RTI found out that the statistics submitted to MDACS and one given by the RTI were not the same,” said Kothari.
 
 Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Pradip Angre defended the blood bank in-charge. “The data discrepancy was an error that crept in because two columns were clubbed into one giving wrong statistics for blood expiry. Also, blood wastage is inevitable to some extent as government hospitals have to keep 10-15% units in buffer to tackle any emergency,” he said. Dr Angre said they were in the process of drafting a response to the MMC.
