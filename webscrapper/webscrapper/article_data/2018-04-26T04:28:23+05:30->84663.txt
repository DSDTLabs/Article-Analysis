NEW DELHI: This was not a day Asaram Bapu was looking forward to. He was up at 6am, and ready by 7. But those around him could sense something different: on judgment day, the godman was nervous. He broke his routine and had lunch at 9.30 itself. By 10, he was in court.

 
 
 When presiding officer   began the proceedings at the temporary court in the jail, Asaram, clad in a white kurta and red cap, shut his eyes and folded his hands, possibly in prayer.
 
 At 10.44am, when Sharma found him guilty and convicted him along with two of the co-accused, his restlessness increased. “He started pushing his battery of lawyers, asking them to say something in his defence. In panic, he started having an ayurvedic medicine,” said  , DCP (west), who was inside the courtroom.
 
 But when the quantum of punishment – jail for life – was read out, Asaram was rattled. He spotted the DIG, Jails,  , and said, “Ab bade court main jayenge. (Now we will approach a higher court).”
 
 But for now, he will stay on in  , as Qaidi No 130. He had been kept isolated at ward no 2 as an undertrial and even as a convict, he will not be allowed to mingle with other inmates “for security reasons”.
 
 Worse, he will lose the little luxuries he was allowed till now. He will no longer be able to enjoy home-made food — with its measured quantities of protein, iodine, citric acid and even fruits. Like other convicts at the jail, Asaram will have to make do with jail food.
 
 In the evening, jail guards noticed him walking inside his ward. He reacted when he noticed a guard looking at him. “Kya ghoor ghoor ke dekh raha hai (What are you staring at?)” snapped the godman, looking now at a future perhaps locked forever in jail.
