A 126-year-old police station is bound to be a witness to change, but beyond the records of crime and punishment the   on  , off   is also an important marker. A strong, intricately carved wooden door at the back of the station is one such remnant of the bygone era. It opens into a room, with a ceiling almost 20ft high, which was once a garage for cars and horse-drawn carriages of British officers.
Now converted into a resting area for traffic policemen, the room has a few benches and a television set. Everyone knows the building is a heritage structure, but very few officers in the station are aware of the story behind this particular room. “In the days when British of ficers served at the station, the room was used to keep their carriages and cars. It was not very big and was later changed into a resting area for the police personnel,“ says S Aravindan, a retired police officer who had worked at the station.
 
 Records of the station's glorious past are minimal.A plaque at the entrance mentions the building was inaugurated in 1890 during the tenure of Madras province governor, Lord Connemara. Henry Irwin, the celebrated architect whose work includes the Mysore palace, Madras high court,   and the Government Museum, was the consulting architect.
 
 Interestingly , a record at the station shows that before its present avatar, the structure till 1855, constructed during the rule of the 12th Nawab of Carnatic Ghulam Muhammad Ghouse Khan, was used as a charitable home to feed and shelter the poor. It was subsequently modified as a police station.
 
 Over the years, the building has seen vast changes with a larger room making way for smaller ones. Outside the room for vintage vehicles now lie several two-wheelers seized by the police, a poor link to what the place once was. Discovered anything interesting of late?
