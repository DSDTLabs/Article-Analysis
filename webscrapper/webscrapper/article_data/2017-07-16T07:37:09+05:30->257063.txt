PUNE: All the six platforms of   would be able to accommodate long-rake trains after their extension, eliminating the chances of a Deccan Queen-like furore in future.

 Divisional railway manager (DRM) of Pune B K Dadabhoy said Rs 37 crore had been sanctioned by the railway headquarters to extend all the platforms of Pune Junction. 
 
 The change of platform of Mumbai-bound Deccan Queen had triggered chaos on July 10 with some passengers forcing the train to stop. “Deccan Queen was shifted to platform No. 5 from platform No. 1 because of technical constraints. The same limitations don’t allow us at this moment to revert the train back to platform No. 1,” he added.
 
 In February, the railway officials had changed the departure platform of Deccan Queen after the authorities decided to attach an additional coach to several trains. With these trains becoming 24-coach trains, only platform No. 1 could accommodate them.
 
 “Apart from platform No. 1, no other platform at the Pune Junction can accommodate a 24-coach rake at present. We had to change the platform of Deccan Queen for this reason. But with all the platforms being extended now, this issue will be solved,” another railway official said. “The platforms’ extension might take at least five to six years as the work has to be done simultaneously with the passenger and train traffic at the station all the time,” he added.
 
 Passengers lauded the platforms’ extension plan. “We are all aware that railway projects take a lot of time. But the future of Pune station looks brighter,”  , a daily passenger, said.
