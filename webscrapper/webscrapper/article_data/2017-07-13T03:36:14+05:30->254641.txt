 A tribal department official said: “It is not very difficult to get an ST certificate if a person is a tribal. So around 90% of the cases are not genuine.” Explaining the modus operandi, the official said, “Mannervarlu tribe is from Kolam (Andhra) while Mannerwar, Munurvar, Munurkapu, Munurwads from Maharashtra come under  . There have been instances of such people from Maharashtra adding ‘lu’ to their surname to get ST certificate.”
 
 The general administration department has asked all departments to compile a list of such employees. “We are yet to get information from the departments,” said a senior official. The final decision may taken by the tribal development department. An official from the CM’s office said the issue may be discussed in the cabinet.
