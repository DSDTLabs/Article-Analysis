MUMBAI: In a development that is likely to hit   in Thane, the   on Friday, in an interim order, said that no commencement or   should be granted to building projects on   

 A division bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Girish Kulkarni passed the orders on a petition by residents claiming   (TMC) was unable to provide adequate   to new highrises coming up on Ghodbunder Road. They were dependent on private water tanker suppliers.
 
 “It is needless to say that in many of the highrises, apart from requiring water for construction, subsequent to construction and occupation, no water connections are provided and occupants are forced to buy water for day-to-day necessities. It is nothing but leaving them to the mercy of the builders,” said the bench. 
 
 The court pointed out how builders and developers were making their own arrangements for water. TMC denied that there was any water shortage, but failed to convince the high court.
