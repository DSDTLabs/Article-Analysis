PATNA: Facing criticism from opposition parties for rampant liquor smuggling despite prohibition in the state, chief minister   on Friday strongly defended his government’s decision and asked his opponents whether the legal provisions against murder and other such crimes should be repealed just because the law enforcing agencies failed to stop crime in the society.
 
  “Chand log kehte hain ki sharabbandi kar bekar ka kaam kiya. Hatya ke aarop mein fansi, ajiwan karawas ka pravdhan hai.  ? Kya kanoon khatm kar hatya ki azadi de di jaye? (Some people say prohibition is a futile exercise. There are provisions like capital punishment and life term for murder. Is no murder being committed? Should the law be scrapped then and people be allowed to commit murder?),” Nitish said while inaugurating the   (Wrestling Cluster) at Mithilesh Stadium here on Friday.
  
  “I studied the   (NCRB) data and found that around 80-90 murders took place every day across the country despite provisions of harsh laws and punishment. Does that mean the law is ineffective and should be repealed,” he asked while referring to the seizure of huge quantity of liquor from different parts of the state despite stringent prohibition law enforced in Bihar.
  
  The CM said efforts were being made to nab all those indulged in illegal liquor trade, but law alone could not succeed unless awareness was created among the people. “The government has launched people’s awareness drive against liquor consumption from January 21 to March 22 and a large number of youths and women are participating in the drive,” he said.
  
  Nitish also said some intellectuals relate liquor consumption with their freedom and constantly oppose the government’s decision, but prohibition has brought dramatic changes in people’s lives in the state. He said liquor ban must be enforced across the country.
