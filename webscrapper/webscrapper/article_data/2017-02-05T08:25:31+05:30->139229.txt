PUDUCHERRY: The   government on Saturday decided to make wearing helmets compulsory for twowheeler riders from May 1 in the Union territory, said chief minister  .

 Narayanasamy said Puducherry recorded 210 fatal accidents and 1,555 other accidents leading to injuries in 2016. Sixty people have died because of head injuries that could have been averted if they had used helmets, he said. â€œFrom May 1 this year Puducherry police will enforce the helmet rules very strictly. So people are requested to buy helmets before the deadline. We have also launched a series of programmes to create awareness among people on the significance of wearing hel met," said Narayanasamy.
 
 The chief minister claimed that the initiatives undertaken by the police department during the   government helped in eliminating extortion, chain snatching, illegal lottery, sale of tobacco products, broad daylight murders, house and land grabbing and kidnapping for ransom in the territory.
