JAIPUR : Commandos from   (ERT), special dog squads and drones have been combing every nook and corner of   to track the body of 9-year-old Naitik   but in vain.   inspector general Alok Kumar   himself went to the spot to direct the search operation; it has been over a fortnight since Bansal, believed to be dead, is missing. 

 An entire platoon of Emergency Response Team (ERT) comprising about 35 commandos has been searching thick jungles to find any clue.
 
 IG Vashishtha visited the forest area in Karauli where accused Ram Singh allegedly claimed to have killed the minor boy. 
 
 "We have drawn cops from Police Lines in Karauli and ERT commandos for the combing operation to track down the boy. We are also interrogating the accused to find out if he had other accomplices," Vashishtha told TOI.
