Actress   is known for her pet-friendly and animal activism initiatives. Recently, when she was out for a quiet getaway on the outskirts of the city with her family, she came across a construction worker who was abusing a litter of puppies. “He seemed sadistic and was beating them with iron rods. I reprimanded him and gave him a sound warning. After reaching home, I couldn’t stop thinking about those puppies. It was then that I decided to contact an animal shelter ( ) and they came forward to help me rescue them. While we couldn’t find the entire litter, we managed to rescue a few and take them to the shelter. We also met the same construction worker and he swore that he would never repeat his act again,” recalls   about the incident.
