MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has restrained   from sealing   at   and disconnecting its water supply over a disputed payment of property tax. 

 The direction by a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and   came on a petition filed by   and Kidney Diseases, a company that runs   & Transplant Center. It challenged the capital value of the hospital building fixed by BMC. The company urged the court to declare BMC's fixing of property tax on basis of capital value as "illegal and unconstitutional". 
 
 The petition said that the Centre has entered into a lease deed with   to run the hospital with 15% of beds reserved for the trust which is a charitable trust.
 
 On March 18, the hospital received a notice from the BMC, demanding immediate payment of 100%, failing which it would seal the premises and disconnect water supply. The hospital rushed to the high court.
 
 On March 27, its advocate, R M Nakhwa, informed that it had deposited nearly Rs 1.3 crore towards property tax for the period from April 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017 a day earlier. This amount was 50% of the demand for the first quarter of that year. He said the amount was accepted by the assistant assessor and collector without prejudice to BMC's rights and pending approval from the higher authority. Nakhwa said 50% was paid from time to time following the high court's 2014 interim order (in another petition) where property owners, and even those not before the court, were directed to go by the pre-amended rates and pay 50% differential amount between old and new rates.
 
 The judges admitted the hospital's petition for final hearing and will hear it on April 25 for grant of interim relief. "In the meanwhile, action of sealing the property of the petitioners and action of disconnection of water supply and electricity supply shall not be taken," the judges said.
