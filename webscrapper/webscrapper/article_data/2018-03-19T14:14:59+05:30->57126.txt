 The actress, who started her career at the age of 15 with a role in the Hindi TV show Ishaan: Sapno Ko Awaaz De, keeps her fans hooked to her social media pages with the stunning pictures that she posting on them.
 
 On a related note, a year back the actress was also in the news for her relationship with her 'Dekha Ek Khwaab' co-actor Ashish Kapoor. They parted ways soon after the show ended. She had shared with TOI at that time, "The relationship was a big mistake. I was only 18 then. That's too young an age to indulge in matters of the heart. We grew apart as our wavelengths did not match â€” he is more outgoing and modern, while I am homely. Despite being part of showbiz, I am nothing like other actors. I don't have many friends in the industry. We grew possessive about each other, which led to compatibility issues. More than being insecure about him, I was confused about what was happening in the relationship." The couple, however, remains friends even after the split.
