It is better that the bench deals with all three,” the AG said.
 
 The bench replied, “The time we have in hand to hear arguments (during vacation) will not be enough to deal with all three issues. We will keep pending other issues — polygamy and nikah halala.

 Making light of the AG’s insistence that all three issues be heard together, the bench said, “AG, it does not even happen in T20 cricket that one can take three wickets in one ball.”
 
 With his arguments focusing on all forms of talaq to be construed as one to allow reconciliation even after irrevocable triple talaq, the AG said, “Even if all three wickets are broken, it is taken as one wicket in cricket.” 
 
 What he meant was, even if a man pronounces triple talaq, it should be construed as one to permit reconciliation, as held by Madras, Gauhati and Delhi HCs. Justice Nariman said, “The AG is bowling like a Chinaman.”
