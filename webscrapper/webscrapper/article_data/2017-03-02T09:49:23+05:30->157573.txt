BATHINDA: Victory in the   (DSGMC) elections has given the   (SAD) a much needed respite. Keeping a low profile after the Punjab assembly elections on February 4, the   leaders of chief minister  's Lambi assembly constituency came out in the open on Wednesday after the trends in   in favour of the party .

 Hailing the SAD victory in DSGMC polls, party president Sukhbir Badal on Wednesday said it was proof of “complete rejection“ of AAP and Congress by the Sikh community .
 
 “The AAP tried its best to prop up its own organisation and formed the Panthic Sewa Dal to put up candidates. They even levelled allegations against the SAD. However, the results show that the Delhi Sikh electorate is completely disillusioned with the AAP and its performance,“ Sukhbir said.
 
 SAD's Muktsar unit president Dyal Singh Kolianwali, facing embarrassment due to snapping of power supply of an electricity meter in the name of his son Parminder Singh for failing to pay dues of Rs 23 lakh, came out to celebrate the victory with fellow leaders and party workers.
 
 Akali Dal leaders also met CM Badal at his farmhouse in Balasar in Sirsa district of Haryana and greeted him joyously. The Malwa zone vice-president of Youth Akali Dal, Ranjodh Singh Lambi, too said the Akalis would retain power in Punjab, “just like DSGMC“.
