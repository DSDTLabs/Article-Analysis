Surat: Local authorities are seriously thinking of adopting an eco-friendly technology for purification and tackling the problem of water hyacinth in Tapi river. This technology is also being used in the National Mission for Clean Ganga. 

 The microalgae that it uses enriches the quality of water and deprives water hyacinth its nutrients, thus killing it. The eco-friendly technology uses microalgae, which is food for aquatic life, for water remediation and helps tackle the problem of reduction of oxygen content in the water. 
 
 In simple process, cultures of microalgae would be inserted in natural sewerages of the river from where the pollutants enter water. The microalgae would be released in a controlled manner to ensure that there is no an algal bloom. The microalgae would remove all these pollutants before they enter the river and also those that come from upstream. It would remove food content from water hyacinth and other macro files, thus giving them no avenue to grow. The dissolved oxygen content would gradually increase in the water, thus making it more clean and pure. Removal of water hyacinth from Tapi is of paramount importance for the citizens in Surat who need 1,070 MLD potable water on a daily basis. 
 
 Jayesh Dave, energy auditor and former SVNIT engineer, told TOI, “This technology originated from an IIT. It is being used in National Mission for Clean Ganga in Jhansi and in Kali River in Muzaffarnagar. Critics say this technology harms marine life but the fact is that it increases DO content in the water. This is worth adopting for a river like Tapi as it has many benefits and does not require any working capital.” 
 
 The Tapi cleanup campaign, which ended recently after 10 days, saw huge pile of water hyacinth that had been removed from the river. Some people believe the quality of the river water could deteriorate in the coming months because water hyacinth so far was absorbing nitrate and phosphate from the polluted water.
