CHENNAI: Indian   could soon use indigenously developed unmanned remotely operated vehicles (ROV) to conduct deep sea  .

 City-based national laboratory ESSO-National Institute of Ocean Technology, which has designed and developed two ROVs, has transferred the technology to the industry.
 
 NIOT director M A Atmanand said they signed an MoU with L&T to manufacture and commercialise the technology. “We have transferred technology for 6,000m ROV as well as shallow water ROV, which underwent trials in Antarctica,” he said. The technology transfer was facilitated through National Research Development Corporation.
 
 NIOT scientists said deep water work class ROV (ROSUB 6000), which has the capability of getting deployed up to a depth 6,000m, was used for mineral exploration and applications like search for missing aircraft.
 
 In one of the deep sea trials, the ROV was deployed to a maximum depth of 5,289m and data such as depth, temperature, sound velocity, conductivity, density and dissolved oxygen were collected.
 
 Scientists said the indigenously developed ROVs can be used not only for research and scientific exploration purposes but also for several   applications. For instance, it can be deployed to conduct   inspection of pipeline of an oil and gas company.
