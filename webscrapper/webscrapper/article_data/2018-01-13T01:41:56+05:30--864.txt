GURGAON: A normal start of the day for a petrol   manager and salesman took an ugly turn at Bharat   on   road on Friday, when the duo was held hostage at gunpoint and robbed of Rs 45,000 by three masked robbers. 

 According to Sandeep, who works as a salesman at fuel station, a white colured   Creta reached petrol pump at 6.30 am and one man asked him to fill diesel in car for Rs 1,020. After this accused gave him a Rs 2,000 note. As   was taking out change to be returned, two other people got down from car and headed towards manager’s cabin. When Sandeep approached the man, sitting in car, with the change, the accused pointed a pistol towards him and asked him to hand over all cash. Sandeep refused which led to accused hitting him on his head with the pistol butt. 
 
 Meanwhile, the other two accused returned from manager’s cabin with cash and the air gun kept there. The salesman claimed that the manager was also thrashed by the accused as he objected to the robbery attempt. 
 
 On Sandeep’s complaint, an FIR was registered against the trio under sections 392 (robbery), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 34 (common intention) of the IPC and 25-54-59 of Arms Act at   police station.
 
 Police sources revealed, the entire incident was recorded on CCTV installed at fuelling station and cops are trying to identify the registration number of the car as the complainant could not note down the same. “We’ve collected CCTV footage. The accused will be arrested soon,” said Ajayveer Bhadana, SHO, Rajendra Park police station.
