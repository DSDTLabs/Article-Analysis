NEW DELHI:   shot into the limelight four years back, when as a 14-year-old she emerged as the champion in the under-16 WTA Future Stars event. Since then she has caught the eye of former Grand Slam doubles champion and current   captain  , who has been mentoring the Delhi girl’s career for the last couple of years.

 
 Bhupathi was instrumental in securing a stint for Karman at the prestigious Patrick Mouratoglou Academy in Nice, back in 2016. From a WTA ranking of 603 at the end of 2016, Karman has risen to career high 282 at the moment and briefly even held the position as India’s No. 1 female tennis player.
 
 Big serves and equally impressive groundstrokes characterise the Indian teen’s game. “The   experience is really nice. The last two matches were against good players in top 50 and 100. These are the girls I am going to face at the next level. Playing in Fed Cup gives me the opportunity of getting to face players ranked in the top 50. Matches like this tell me which areas I need to improve,” the Delhi girl said.
