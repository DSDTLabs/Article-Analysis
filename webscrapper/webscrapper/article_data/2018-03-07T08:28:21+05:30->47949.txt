SURAT: Amid apprehensions in Indian diamond industry over companies reducing their rough diamond purchases following Indian banks tightening credit conditions in the wake of multi-crore bank scam by Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi,  , the world’s leading diamond mining company, has reported good sales in its second cycle in March. 

 The multi-crore banking scam seems not to have dented the spirit of diamond barons from buying rough   from the world’s leading miners.
 
 In the latest figures published by De Beers, the sales of rough diamonds in the second cycle increased from $553 million in previous year to $555 million in the current year. 
 
 De   CEO Bruce Cleaver said “The second sales cycle of the year saw the continuation of good rough diamond demand. This was in line with expectations, following strong retail sales of diamond jewellery during the US holiday season and positive early signs for consumer demand over Chinese New Year.”
 
 In an email reply, De Beers company spokesperson, David Johnson said, “Reports in some media regarding De Beers reducing allocations to Indian diamond companies are misleading. The company has not reduced any allocations as a result of the recently reported banking issues in India. The sales in the second cycle of 2018 were lower than those in the first cycle of the year, simply because of the seasonality of demand that we see every year.”
 
 Diamond industry leader   said, “At present, the industry is not at all affected due to the banking scam by Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. The business is as usual as it was post-scam. In fact, the season is looking good following renewed consumer demand in China and the US.”
 
 Shah added, “The Indian banks need to understand the fact that not all diamond companies are sailing in the same boat in which Modi and Choksi were. If the banks tighten the banking norms on diamond industry, India is going to lose its export share in international market.”
