GADHINAGAR: Congress is all set to unveil a cohesive cyber campaign strategy, arguably for the first time, for Gujarat where assembly elections are due later this year.
 
  A cyber war room has already been set up in Ahmedabad in this connection, with 40 workers working round the clock to ramp up the party’s negligible cyber presence and on Sunday the IT Cell of Congress held a big programme in the presence of  , the political advisor of Congress President  .
  
  Congress is looking to develop content at three levels for its social media campaign. “For starters, we will focus on promises made in the earlier manifestos by BJP and how they have gone back on them. We will also show how the NDA government has carried out gross injustices towards Gujarat,” Rohan Gupta, the convenor of  , told ET.
  
  BJP had in 2012 election carried out an advertising blitzkrieg on similar lines targeting the Congress-led UPA government. “And finally, we shall project our vision of Gujarat under our slogan of Navsarjan Gujarat, which would basically bring out how Gujarat has suffered under the BJP rule and how we intend to pull it back to its rightful state,” he added.
  
  The cell is also toying with a locally developed software, SMWarrior, that tracks social media activity of each member of the cell. “For each like or share on social media, the cell members earn points and higher the points, the better it is for the worker,” explains Gupta, adding that this would bring in certain level of accountability among the workers.
  
  However, the party would bring in professional agencies at a later phase to add momentum to the campaign, he added.“The IT Cell has percolated till block level and now working on expanding to each constituency,” says Gupta, adding that the idea is to reach at the booth level and have one member for every booth.
  
  “This time we would want to focus on local issues and our manifesto will contain separate vision documents for each district,” he added.
