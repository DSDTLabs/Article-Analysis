KOLKATA: Morning started quite late for city mayor Sovan Chatterjee who was supposed to appear before the   (ED) officials at   complex in connection with the Narada sting operation. 

 Chatterjee woke up at 9am only to find media persons waiting in front of his residence. For the next two hours mayor locked himself in his room. Chatterjee then finished his breakfast with Luchi and sweet and then came out of the house and was seen making frantic calls without noticing the television crew that had gathered to his residence since early morning.
 
 Till 11.30 pm, Chatterjee kept the media guessing whether he would visit the ED office and keep a date with the investigating officials. He broke his silence at noon after a lawyer came and took a copy of an application addressed to the ED higher-up requesting to grant fortnight more for taking 'necessary preparation.' "I won't go to ED office today" was the brief reply from mayor to the media waiting for hours. All of a sudden mayor was ready to leave his house. The convoy drove at a breakneck speed before the media could chase him.
 
 Though mayor's convoy initially headed for the KMC headquarters on S.N. Banerjee Road, Chatterjee changed his mind and took Maa flyover and drove toward Salt Lake. However, mayor's convoy took a U-turn as soon as it reached near a Star hotel near Salt Lake stadium.
 
 At 2 pm Chatterjee reached KMC headquarters and locked himself in his chamber. He called select member, mayor-in-council members and officials to his chamber to discuss certain important civic policy matters. At 5pm mayor headed for   with civic officials for an inspection after holding a media conference where he made it clear that he was happy that the ED had granted his prayer. "I will keep a date with the ED next time and tell them whatever I need to tell them," Chatterjee said.
