CHENNAI : Union minister of state finance and shipping   said the   government was not capable of governing  . He was scathing in his attack of the two Dravidian parties as well as   on the Sterlite issue. 

 "The killing of 13 people in police firing in   shows that the AIADMK government is not worthy of governing the state," the minister told reporters at Chennai airport soon after landing from New Delhi. 
 
 Reacting to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami stating that it was due to mingling of anti-social elements with the protesters, the police had to resort to firing, the minister said "if the AIADMK government says anti-social elements mingled with protesters and that led to firing, what was the state intelligence doing and what action has the government taken against the anti-social elements." 
 
 He also blamed Congress and DMK for permitting the company to set up its unit in Tuticorin. "There is a wrong propaganda among the people of Tuticorin about BJP and Sterlite. I ask the people not to believe such propaganda. It is only the AIADMK, DMK and Congress which are responsible for Sterlite setting up factory in Tuticorin," the minister said.
