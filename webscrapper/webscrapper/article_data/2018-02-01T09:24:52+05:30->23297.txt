LUCKNOW: Even as reports suggest that the   violence was the result of a ‘tiranga yatra’, the   ( ) has questioned the need for seeking permission from the administration for any patriotic event like this one.

 “Why should an official permission be sought for holding patriotic events like tiranga yatra,” said VHP spokesperson for Awadh praant Sharad Sharma on Wednesday.
 
 However, VHP distanced itself from any tiranga yatra in the state. It denied that the organization had planned or was planning any such yatra. However, it added that members of VHP were taking out such processions in their individual capacity.
 
 A senior VHP functionary in Meerut said that condolence meetings were held in 20 western UP districts of Braj region on Wednesday. A memorandum addressed to chief minister   was handed over to the respective DMs demanding strict action against those who killed Chandan Gupta while he was participating in a “patriotic activity”.
 
 People with flags in their hands paid condolences to Gupta, who was killed in Kasganj on January 26.
 
 “But, it was not a tiranga yatra. Walking with a flag in hand does not make it a tiranga yatra,” said Meerut organization secretary  . VHP office-bearers also reiterated that the organization had informed the administration about the event as a rule.
 
 “We demand immediate arrest of those who killed the ‘deshbhakt’ (patriotic person) who was taking out a tiranga yatra on an auspicious occasion like Republic Day,” he said.
 
 VHP functionaries said the attack on a youth while in a tiranga yatra was an attack on one’s freedom of expression. The country, said a senior functionarys, was independent and no one could deny citizens freedom of expression.
 
 “No one can be killed for singing Vande Mataram,” he said.
 
 The organization also said it always informs the administration ahead of any event. “I am sure the organization in Kasganj informed the administration about the tiranga yatra,” said Sharma.
