HYDERABAD: Residents can expect some respite from the dry and hot weather as the local met office has predicted showers across the city over the next two days. A two-day thunderstorm warning for the city and surrounding districts has also been issued. A brief spell late on Saturday brought down temperatures marginally.

 According to the weatherman, a trough running from central Madhya Pradesh to the Comorin region across Karnataka and Rayalaseema has been infusing moisture with the dry air prevalent in the region. “The moisture-laden air, has aided in the formation of rain-bearing clouds. These clouds are expected to bring about a spell of showers and thunderstorm over the city,” said Dr K Naga Ratna, senior scientist, Indian   (IMD). 
 
 However, experts from private weather forecasting agencies, such as Skymet, add a word of caution saying that the increased levels of humidity, when combined with high day temperatures, would result in the heat becoming uncomfortable. “These showers will occur during the latter afternoon or evening only. Though the showers will provide significant relief, it will only be momentary,” said an expert from Skymet.
