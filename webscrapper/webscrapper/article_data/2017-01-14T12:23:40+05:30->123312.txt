KOCHI: Tonnes of gunnysacks stored in an open yard outside two shops gutted at   in Kalady around 12.30pm on Friday. 

 Residents in the area said that the fire broke out after miscreants burnt waste near the shops. The fire from the waste caught the sack rolls and spread to the tiled-roof shops damaging gunnysacks and other things kept inside.
 
 Fire personnel from four fire stations rushed to the spot and took three hours to douse the fire. 
 
 “We pressed seven units of fire engines from four fire stations to douse the fire. The loss is estimated to be above Rs 5 lakh,” said M S Baiju, station officer of  . 
 
 A   could be averted due to the timely intervention of fire officials who prevented further spread of fire into a ration shop, which has been functioning adjacent to the shops. Kerosene was stored in four barrels and rice was kept in sacks inside the ration shop when the fire broke out.
 
 Since the gutted shops were functioning alongside MC Road, the fire badly affected the traffic movement. 
 
 The police, who were busy with Nadathurappu festival at   in Kalady, had a tough time to divert vehicles heading towards Nedumbassery side.
