PATNA: The   and   have appealed to CM Nitish Kumar to decide how he would maintain his secular image now that communal clashes were taking place in the state.

  Pradesh Congress Committee’s in- charge Kaukab   asked Nitish to come out of the clutches of communal forces (read  ), following which talks could be held to bring like-minded people together.
 
 “Nitish is known as a secular neta. He had come with us and RJD in 2014 to counter the BJP and RSS. But he again went back to them, citing development issues. Now that several districts in Bihar are affected by communal tensions, Nitish must decide whether he wants to stay with the BJP-RSS or leave,” Quadri told TOI, adding he spoke with Nitish over the phone on recent communal violence at Aurangabad, which is his (Quadri’s) home district.
 
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad too said in Delhi that Nitish was moving towards his fall. Speaking to reporters on his arrival in the national capital for medical treatment, Lalu also said the BJP was behind all the communal incidents in Bihar.
 
 “Nitish is now finished. There are riots and incidents of violence all over Bihar. The BJP has set the whole state ablaze,” he said.
 
 RJD MLC   too said Nitish should maintain his secular image.
