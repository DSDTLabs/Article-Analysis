KOLLAM: Since the past couple of days yellow frogs noticed abundantly in some of the wetlands of the state have not only created news but also triggered panic because of reports that these frogs are highly poisonous. This has resulted in these frogs being indiscriminately killed. 

 
 But   and chairman of the   Sainudeen   said that there was no reason to panic. These frogs are not poisonous as feared but just the common Indian bull frogs that in the past used to be abundantly found in wetlands across the state.
 
 Pattazhy, zoology professor of   here, said that these frogs (Hoplobatrachus tigerinus) that generally sport a dull olive-green hue most of the time,   during mating season. They also congregate during the mating season.
 
 "The Indian bullfrogs which are considered farmer-friendly since they prey on insects used to be hunted for their meat (thighs) and exported. It led to the frogs being driven to extinction point. Now, they are protected under Schedule 1V of the Wildlife Act. However, in some countries like Thailand, they are still hunted," Pattazhy said.
 
 In a statement issued here, he said that people should desist from killing these frogs on the basis of rumours. They are actually excellent mosquito controllers, he added.
