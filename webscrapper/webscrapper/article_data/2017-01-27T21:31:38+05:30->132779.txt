BHOPAL: Minister for agriculture development and farmer welfare Gauri Shankar Bisen has not been able to figure-out the technicalities of the Centre's Pradhan Mantri Fasal   (PM Crop Insurance Scheme). 

 Speaking to reporters in   ( ) on Wednesday, the minister said, "The Union government has launched the scheme. We have not been able to understand the output of the scheme so far. Neither have we been able to make farmers understand the advantages of the scheme."
 
 PM Modi launched the Crop Insurance Scheme in February last year under which farmers need to pay 2% premium for kharif crops and 1.5% for Rabi crops. But Bisen said the technicalities of the scheme are so complex that it is nearly incomprehensible. Hence, farmers have not benefitted from the scheme so far and the relief from it has not been very significant.
 
 Bisen was in Morena as chief guest for a religious discourse organised by MLA from Jaura seat  . After the programme he told reporters, "Revenue department officials are being trained by the state government on crop insurance implementation. After they work-out the complexities in the provisions of the scheme, that farmers may start getting the benefits."
 
 The agriculture minister also said that under the Centre's scheme it is hard to gauge the definition of damage or loss of crops due to natural calamities. All the terms, conditions, provisions and definitions need to be discussed, he added. Bisen's argument against the NDA-Centre's scheme has started a controversy since he is a senior cabinet minister in a BJP state government.
