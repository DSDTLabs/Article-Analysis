MUMBAI: Land acquisition for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed rail corridor is set to begin and a host of government agencies are expected to assist in speeding up the project.

 An official of  , which is implementing the project, said, “Apart for the railway ministry, other agencies such as the   of India and those involved in road development are also in the process of acquiring land.” The official added, “Land acquisition is yet to begin but misinformation is being spread. For example, farmers are worried that soil will be dumped in their fields. Also, some fear access from one side of the train corridor to the other will be blocked. Maharashtra recently appointed a liaison officer and we hope that misgivings are resolved.” In Maharashtra, land acquisition will be needed the most in Palghar.
 
 The underground section will be beneath the creek outside Mumbai. The official said a seismic resistance test was carried out beneath the sea bed between December 11 and 24.
 
  
 “High energy sound waves were fired beneath the water. This helped determine density of the rock. Results of the study have been sent to   for analysis after which alignment can be fixed and work can begin.” Underground section work will be carried out at a depth of 40-70m. “The site at BKC for the terminal is not yet officially handed over to us but we have proposed to   to work on integration with Metro-III underground corridor.”
