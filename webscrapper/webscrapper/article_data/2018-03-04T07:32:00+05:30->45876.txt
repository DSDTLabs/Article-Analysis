CHANDIGARH: A 28-year-old man was killed after he was fired at twice over a panchayat election dispute in   village, Ratia sub-division of   district, on Friday. Ravi Kumar died on the spot, while his uncle was injured.

 Police said Ravi was the younger brother of sarpanch Seema Rani’s husband. Seema defeated Suman Devi during the panchayat electons last year. After Suman tried to challenge Seema’s election and failed, her family had been nursing the grudge against the sarpanch, it has been alleged. 
 
 Police said Ravi and some kin of Suman, led by her husband  , had an argument while playing Holi on Friday.
 
 Initially, the issue was resolved, but the groups clashed again when Ravi was returning home from the fields with his group. It is alleged that Vinod and his friends opened fire as a result one bullet hit Ravi in the neck and the other hit him in his back. He fell unconscious. Meanwhile, Vinod opened fire at Ravi’s uncle Jai Singh as well.
 
 Ravi was rushed to civil hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Inspector   of Ratia police station said investigations were in progress and no arrests had been made so far. Jai is said to be out of danger.
