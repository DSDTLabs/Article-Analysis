NAGPUR: The year-end statistics of 2016, showing   like chain snatching and robberies, may act as morale booster for city police. Moreover, the city police also have something more to cheer as chief minister   on Sunday publicly acknowledged the subtle transformation from no-nonsense policing of former CP SP Yadav to implementation of futuristic ‘transformative ideas’ of incumbent top cop K Venkatesh.

 Chain-snatching, once considered a nagging challenge, had already been curbed in the earlier half of 2016 but the cops ensured that the year ends with a steep decline from 202 incidents in 2015 to 120 in the year gone by. Police also improved the detection rate bettering it from 30% to 39%.
 
 The reduction in the number of robberies from 299 in 2015 to 220 last year also highlights the efforts put in by the men in khaki, especially the crime branch sleuths.
 
 DCP, Crime,  , holding charge as additional CP, reasoned that busting of a few gangs involved in chain-snatching has helped police curtail the crime. “Action by Ambazari police, in which a notorious chain-snatcher was trapped, helped the law enforcers detect around 42-45 cases. This also improved the detection figures,” he said. 
 
 Crime branch, under Sharma, had been implementing ‘Dattak yojana’ in which criminals were brought under strict vigil through one-to-one surveillance with a cop focusing on an individual outlaw. In similar manner, police stations too followed the practice. Crime branch played a vital role in gathering data, records and making it available to police stations.
 
 Sharma also said the decrease in burglary cases from 1,123 in 2015 to 921 last year was due to efforts by Hudkeshwar and Jaripatka police stations which managed to put brakes on the rising trend despite the areas being vulnerable ones due to their desolate locations. “The detection rate in burglaries too improved from 24% in 2015 to 26% last year,” he said.
 
 Sharma, who promised to continue the two-pronged policy of targeting gangs and also individual criminals in 2017, said that two teams would be separately working on the cases under Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act. “We ended the year 2016 with 36 MPDA cases, while there had been 38 cases in 2015. In 2017, our target is to send 100 criminals behind bars for a considerable period under MPDA Act,” he said.
 
 Analysing the murder trend, Sharma argued that the trend cannot be said to have gone out of control in 2016 barring a few days of December when there were repeated incidents. “The average of murders in the last 12 years since 2005 is around 94 and so considering that the city witnessed three less incidents in 2016. The detection rate in murder cases in 2016 was 96% which comes close to 2011 when it was 99%,” he said. “The one murder case that had remained undetected in 2011 has been detected by us in 2016 (Shubhas Shahu case),” said Sharma.
