TRICHY: To create awareness among children about arts and craft and to inspire them to take them up as extra-curricular activities, a pop-up book and   exhibition was kick-started at the district central library on Wednesday.

 The two-day exhibition featured around 200 artworks made by the arts teacher of   government higher secondary school, K Aruna Balan.
 
 The pop-up books that were exhibited were of varied themes including ‘deforestation’, ‘the story of the flight’ and ‘almighty in all' (a book on secularism). 
 
 Following the exhibition, Balan would also be conducting an origami and pop-up book workshop for children at the library on May 5, 6 and 7. Explaining about why origami and pop-up books were chosen as the theme for the exhibition, Balan said that   was still not well-informed about these crafts and that he wanted to create an awareness regarding the same. “When compared to cities like Chennai and Bengaluru, people in Trichy are not aware about different kinds of arts and crafts – especially origami and pop-up books. These two are visually very appealing to the children,” he said. During the workshop, children would be taught the basics of origami and pop-up books and would be asked to come up with their own artworks. Apart from this workshop, the district central library, as a part of its summer vacation programmes, would be offering few other workshops, also focusing on arts and craft for children. District library officer, A P Sivakumar, said, “Creativity is a necessary trait that children should develop and we wish to inculcate that among them through arts and crafts.
