If there is one thing that the team of today’s release,  , is extremely proud of, it is that the film is technically-advanced for a Kannada film. “As everyone knows, the film has been made by the efforts of a bunch of technicians, so everyone ensured that their expertise shows in the making. For instance, our cinematographer Sudhakar Raj, who initiated the whole process of the team coming together to make the film, was at the forefront to ensure that it is visual spectacle. Everyone involved brought their 100% to the table, which, in turn, has upped the grandeur of the film, bringing it on par with films from other industries,” says director  .
As is with all   films,   is the main element here too, but since Raambo 2, produced by Laddoo Films and De Arte Studios, is also a thriller, there is a lot of drama as well. “Quite a bit of emotions are at play, in fact, far more than what you usually see in a Sharan film. There is a beautiful message as well at the end of the film,” says Anil.
 But the biggest highlight, says the filmmaker, is the Sharan-Chikkanna combination. “Audiences have seen them together in multiple films and there is a certain expectation when they collaborate. This time around, we have given   an image makeover of sorts, with a modern avatar. Even his lingo and body language has been changed and his interactions with Sharan will be a laugh riot,” says Anil, adding, “And last, but not the least, is Arjun Janya’s music for the film, which makes it a complete entertainment package for family audiences.”
