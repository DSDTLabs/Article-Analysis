New Delhi: The income tax department is probing a sitting Haryana MLA for alleged links with a food processing unit in Jind, where recent raids have unearthed Rs 8 crore in cash and jewellery worth Rs 2 crore.

 Sources said that the MLA who has been summoned by the investigating officer has so far refused to appear. The tax department has, however, not revealed the identity of the lawmaker or the political party with which the politicians is associated.
 
 The food processing unit came under the scanner based on information that it allegedly had unaccounted cash on the premises and it was undertaking cash transactions. In addition, the company is accused of booking bogus expenses apart from introducing unaccounted income into the books through accommodating entries via shell companies.
 
 This had resulted in searches on the food processing facility.
 
 Sources said that the offices and residence of the MLA were also searched and the legislator’s son was present and has been cooperating with the tax authorities.
 
 “The documents have substantiated the tax department’s case and directors of the company, chartered accountants and some employees have also recorded their statement in the case,” said a source.
 
 The tax department has stepped up scrutiny over the last six months or so and is trying to crack down on unaccounted wealth. It has conducted a series of raids including on some entities that have alleged links with politicians.
 
 In fact, there is focused attention on some segments as the government is also trying to crack down on benami property which at times involves politicians and bureaucrats.
