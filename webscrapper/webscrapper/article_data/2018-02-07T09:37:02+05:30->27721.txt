JAIPUR:   whip   on Tuesday accused the state government of failing to provide drinking water to Sikar from the Kumbha Ram Arya Lift Canal Project. 

 During question hour, Dotasra said chief minister   had promised during her Suraj Sankalp Yatra in 2013 that canal's drinking water would be provided to entire Shekhawati region but in past four years the government has been unable to prepare even the DPR (detailed project report).
 
 PHED and ground water minister Surendra Goyal said Rs 453.63 lakh have been sanctioned for survey to provide groundwater in Sikar and Jhunjhunu districts. The work will be completed by December 2018, the minister said.
 
 Intervening during another question, parliamentary affairs minister Rajendra Rathore said the government would soon allow MLA funds to be used to build one community hall in villages with population 1000, up to two halls in villages with 2500 population and up to three halls in villages with more than 2500 population.
 
  MLA Sandeep Sharma demanded accountability of toll tax collecting agencies in keeping the highways clear of abandoned cattle and providing prompt medical aid to road accident victims. Transport minister Yunus Khan said the responsibility was already fixed on these agencies, which can even be penalized for failing on either count.
 
 During the zero hour, Congress' Nasirabad legislator Ramnarayan Gurjar sat on dharna in the well of house alleging that Ajmer district police were harassing innocent people, while law and order in the region was missing. Parliamentary affairs minister Rajendra Rathore objected saying that the MLA ought to have followed assembly rules to stage a protest. Speaker  , however, assured the opposition legislator that his grievance would be conveyed to the state government for proper redressal.
