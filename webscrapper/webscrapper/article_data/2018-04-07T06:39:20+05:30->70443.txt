MANALI:   Pass received snowfall on Friday. The weather threw its conundrum a day after the   (BRO) cleared the pass for a smooth traffic flow on the Manali-Rohtang-Keylong highway. Despite receiving 5cm snowfall, 40 vehicles from Manali crossed Rohtang on Friday and reached Lahaul safely.

 Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Ashwani Kumar Chaudhary said only one-way traffic was being allowed across Rohtang Pass as the freshly-opened highway was narrow and slippery.
 
 “Vehicles from Manali were allowed on Friday. Vehicles from Lahaul to Manali will be allowed on Saturday. The road is still slippery. As the mountain pass can experience snowfall any time, tourists should keep a shovel for emergency. Also, vehicles would be allowed only between 10am and 3pm,” he said.
 
 The highway has opened for the vehicles after a gap of four months. To deal with the possibility of more snowfall, the BRO has stationed its machinery here.
 
 Meanwhile, on Friday, many parts of Kullu and Kangra received rain and the high peaks of Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti, Chamba, Kinnaur and Kangra district experienced light snowfall. Keylong recorded minimum temperature of 2.7 degrees Celsius. While the mercury in Manali and Kalpa dropped to 5.6 degrees Celsius, Dharamshala and Shimla recorded night temperature of 10.2 and 13.4 degrees Celsius, respectively.
 
  of Shimla in the next five days has predicted thunderstorms and rain over low and mid hills and snowfall over high hills.
 
 Apple growers in the state are worried about a sudden dip in temperature as it could harm the crop. The low temperature kills insects and affects the pollination process.
