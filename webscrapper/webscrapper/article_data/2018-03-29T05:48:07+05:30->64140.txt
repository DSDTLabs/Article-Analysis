MUMBAI: The HC on Wednesday said that the practice of issuing   to new transport vehicles only on the basis of manufacturer's certificate without holding independent tests is a breach of law. 

 "If the certificate of (fitness) inspection is issued only on the basis of manufacturer's certificate it is completely a breach of the law," said a bench of Justices   and  . It rejected the State government's argument that it in view of the manufacturers' certificate, it is not necessary to conduct fitness tests. The government is directed to take a decision on amending its circulars to include the mandatory tests to be conducted while issuing fitness certificates and inform the court on April 25.
 
 In its February 2016 final judgment, on a PIL by   that fitness certificates are issued/renewed without mandatory tests, the court had issued detailed directions. Last month, Karve informed that new transport vehicles are not tested for fitness and the fitness certificates are issued only on the basis of manufacturer's certificate. The judges said Motor Vehicle Act provides that even if a vehicle is registered, but it does not carry a certificate of fitness in the prescribed form, the vehicle shall not be deemed to be validly registered. "It is already held in final judgment that if a vehicle does not possess fitness certificate it cannot be treated as registered," they noted.
 
 The judges said under  , tests prescribed for issue of fitness certificate are must. "In a given case nothing prevents the inspecting authorities from conducting those tests before issuing fitness certificates," they added.
