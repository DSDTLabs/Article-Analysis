SHIMLA: While hearing a matter pertaining to the non-lifting of garbage here for the last few few days, the   high court on Saturday observed that a handful of employees could not hold the city to ransom and more so, at this point in time, when the tourist season was at its peak. The court has directed the striking workers engaged by the   to immediately resume work. 

 It directed the DC, SP, municipal commissioner of Shimla besides member secretary,  , to file their affidavits of compliance by the next date of hearing and listed the matter for Monday. 
 
 "Garbage cannot be allowed to remain uncollected within the city. The municipal solid waste has to be collected and disposed of in accordance with law at the earliest," observed a division bench of acting Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Ajay Mohan Goel.
 
 The court said it had failed to understand as to why for the last three days, as the court is made to understand, since the employees are on strike, no steps were taken against the workers under the statutory provisions and more specifically, the Himachal Pradesh Essential Services (Maintenance) Act, 1973. 
 
 "We have been informed that the pollution control board has also not initiated any action. We fail to understand as to why the regulator has chosen to remain a mute spectator," it added and directed the DC, SP, and commissioner,   to communicate the order to all employees and ensure compliance.
 
 "We clarify that if anyone of the workers fails to discharge his/her duties, not only would it amount to contempt of court, but it shall be open for the MC to forthwith terminate their services and re-engage fresh hands for disposal of municipal solid waste," it added.
 
 The court said that any hindrance or obstruction caused by any person in the enforcement of court orders shall be in contempt of court and asked police to act.
