HYDERABAD: Taking its cue from AP, Telangana wants to have complete independence in the appointment and tenure of the head of the police force. Towards that end, it is all set to bring about a Head of   (HOPF) Act which will do away with the central nod for the appointment of HOPF besides the mandated two-year fixed term that currently applies to the top police post.

 Once the Act is in place, the Telangana government will soon have power to choose a HOPF of its choice.
 
 
 The draft of the HOPF Act has been cleared by the general administration department and sent to the law department. It is likely to be placed before the state cabinet at its meeting on March 8, said sources.
 
 “As per the norms laid down by the   in the   case in 2006, a panel of names should be sent to the Union home ministry and UPSC, which will select three names and send it to the state allowing the latter to pick one from them. Besides, as per the SC verdict, a HOPF should have a minimum of two years of service irrespective of their superannuation. These two provisions will be eliminated,” a senior home department official said.
 
 Various states have been demanding that the state government should have powers in appointing DGPs as law and order subject is a state’s matter. In December 2017, the AP government abolished the State Police Act and brought in an ordinance to pave the way for the appointment of M Malakondaiah as the HOPF. At the time of his appointment, Malakondaiah had a tenure of six months, till June 2018.
 
 This being the case, the   twice rejected the panel of names sent by AP on grounds that one of them (Malakondaiah) had only six months of service left as against the stipulated two years. In order to appoint Malakondaiah, TDP government issued the ordinance by which it could appoint a HOPF on its own without getting concurrence from the Centre.
