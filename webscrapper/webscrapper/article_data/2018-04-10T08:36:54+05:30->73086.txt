NEW DELHI:   chief   on Monday led his party on a nationwide fast targeting the Modi government but a picture of party leaders having ‘chholebhature’ before the protest gave BJP fodder to launch a counter-attack and dub the exercise a "farce" and "joke on Dalits".

 Gandhi, whose party had announced the fast over a variety of issues, including alleged caste and communal violence, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being "anti-Dalit".
 
 In another apparent embarrassment, Congress had to ask anti-Sikh riots accused Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler to stay away from dais at Rajghat, where the fast was held in Delhi.
 
 Speaking at the Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial, Rahul launched a scathing attack on the government. "We are standing here against the BJP’s oppressive ideology. We are standing here today and will stand against it all our life and we will defeat them in the 2019 elections," Gandhi said.
 
  
  
 
 Gandhi said opposition leaders were being dubbed as animals — in a reference to BJP chief Amit Shah’s remarks that opposition leaders were like snakes and mongooses who flock together during floods — but the fact is that everyone is against the government today.
 
 The government was working against Dalits, tribals, minorities and farmers, the Congress leader said, adding the country will not accept its attempt to spread violence and hatred.
 
 It is the BJP’s ideology to "divide the country and crush Dalits, crush tribals and minorities", he said.
 
 He also spoke of BJP’s Dalit MPs writing to Modi and claimed that the ruling party’s members tell him in   that Modi was "casteist" and "anti-Dalit".
 
 At the fast, Rahul Gandhi was joined by his colleagues  ,  ,  ,  , Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken and the party’s communications incharge Randeep Surjewala.
 
 Congress workers in all state and district headquarters sat on the fast, the party said.
