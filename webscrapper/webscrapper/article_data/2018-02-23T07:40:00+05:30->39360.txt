AMRITSAR: Three Punjabi-origin   Sukh Dhaliwal from Surrey-Newton, Randeep Singh Sarai from Surrey-central and   from Brampton visited the   campus on Thursday, where they were accorded a grand reception as students performed bhangra and giddha and sang welcome songs.

 Sukh, an alumnus of the college, recalled his days as a student during 1979 and 1980 when he completed his pre-engineering from here and went to settle in Canada. Talking to newspersons, Sukh said, “Physics was my favourite subject and I remember my stay in Jind hostel.” He inquired about his teachers, all of whom had retired. He interacted with other teachers and college principal Mehal Singh.
 
 The MPs were elated when Canadian deputy leader of parliament   also joined the celebrations. They watched giddha by students at an open-air theatre before taking the rounds of the corridors of the heritage building of the college. The MPs were honoured by Khalsa College governing council honorary secretary Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina. “We had even invited Canadian Prime Minister   but his schedule was too tight. However, we are thankful to his four MPs for visiting the campus,” said Chhina.
 
 Sarai described Khalsa College as a leading Sikh heritage site. “There is ample scope of exchange programmes between Khalsa College and Canadian educational institutes. We will work on it,” he said. Winnipeg MP Kevin said, “Punjabis have worked so hard for the development of Canada.” Sonia said she felt honoured to be a daughter of a senior alumnus of Khalsa College Paramjit Singh Randhawa.
