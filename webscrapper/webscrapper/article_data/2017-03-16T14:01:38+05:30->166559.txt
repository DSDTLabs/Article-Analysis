Pune: City-based education startup accelerator   has brought six new firms into its accelerator programme.

 Edugild, which started its operations in late 2015, has seen through the accelerator programme for 10 other education   in the previous two batches. Most of these firms deliver content, courses or counselling through innovative use of technology.
 
 In the current batch, three startups are from India and three are from the  . These companies are working on different aspects like augmented reality, gamification, skill assessment and student motivation management, among other things.
 
 The accelerator programme runs for 12-18 months as Edugild thinks education technology is a long-term venture. Each startup gets an exclusive venture partner (in exchange of 1% sweat-equity) that has the mandate to take the organization forward. Edugild takes about 2-3% stake in each startup.
 
 “In the last 18 months, Edugild has successfully scaled up 10 Edtech companies 7 from India, 2 from USA and 1 from  ,” the company said in a statement. Most of the members in the startups from abroad are of Indian origin and some of them are looking to get a foothold in the Indian market. The third batch of startups, Edugild said, were selected from over 300+ companies, who applied for the programme.
 
 “The accelerator programme focuses on revenue first and funding later,” said Rishi Kapal, global strategist and CEO, Edugild. So, the accelerator focuses on companies that already have some proof of concepts ready and are looking to scale up fast. 
 
 Of the first 10 startups, about 8 are already generating revenue. In future, Edugild hopes to maintain a balance of 50:50 between Indian and global startups.
