NEW DELHI:   on Saturday hurled beamers at the Aam Aadmi Party, accusing it of creating a false “wave“ through paid online “flunkies“ on social media. AAP dismissed the claims of the former cricketer-turnedpolitician, saying he needed to spend more time with Congress to understand its nature.

 “Ye jo social media ki afwahein hain, ye jo Kejriwal saab apne khareede hue tattuon ki taraf se wave banane ki koshish karte hain, ye jo trolls hain, aaj unki bhi bahut badi haar hui hai. Kyunki satya pratarit ho sakta hai, kabhi parajit nahin ho sakta (these social media rumours, these waves that Mr Kejriwal tries to project with his purchased flunkies, these trolls ­ today they have lost hugely as well. Truth can be mistreated, not defeated),“ Sidhu said.
 
 AAP's social media head Ankit Lal told TOI over phone: “Jis party ka campaign Prashant Kishor ne kiya ho, ussey bada farjiwada nahin ho sakta (the party for which Prashant Kishor did the campaign ­ there cannot be a bigger fraudulence than that) Sidhu saab is still new in the Congress. He needs to spend more time with the party to know it better.“
 
 In the run-up to the elections, AAP and Congress had engaged in many a social media tiff. Party leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Amarinder Singh engaged in a war of words, challenging each other to win more votes. Last December, Kejriwal and Singh traded virtual punches. 
 
 After Singh questioned AAP's choice of candidate from the Lambi constituency on Twitter, Kejriwal asked him, “Sir, r u fighting against Prakash Badal ji or Sukhbir Badal or Majithia or safe seat?“ Singh retorted: “Badals' story is over. You tell me where you're contesting from and I will come fight you there!“
