PATNA: Navaratra being a typical no-onion-no-garlic affair for many, restaurants and food joints in the city are serving food without these ingredients to cater to those who are on a strict fasting diet as well as for the ones who won’t mind trying the subtle and stunning flavours of a traditional vrat meal.

 Many restaurants have also tailored special thalis to woo the food lovers.
 
 Amit Bhagat, operational manager of a restaurant in a high-rise building near Gandhi Maidan, said a plate of Navaratra thali costs Rs 349, excluding taxes. The thali includes aloo jeera, malai kofta/paneer makhani, yellow dal/dal makhani, lachha paratha, green salad and gulab jamun. “Apart from Navaratra special thali, we provide food items without onion and garlic on demand,” Bhagat added.
 
 People are also thronging a vegetarian outlet known for its special Navaratra thali. One can relish the thali by spending just Rs 250. The thali includes four kuttu ki puri, samat rice, aloo-sitaphal ki sabzi and makhana kheer. Nand Kishor Singh, manager of the outlet on Boring Road, said 100-150 thalis are sold in a day during Navaratra.
 
 One of the restaurants opposite Maurya Lok at Hira Place is offering unlimited food from Rs 399 onwards. Rupa Sinha of the restaurant said the concept is anti-buffet where people can order food of their choice unlike buffet concept in which they have to select from the limited options. “During Navaratra, Shabnam ki roti made of mushroom and cheese, fruity paneer zaitooni tikka, pan-kulfi and Rajasthani cuisine like dal bati and chorma find many takers,” said Sinha. 
 
 Not only restaurants, even shops selling namkin items are preparing snacks using ‘sendha namak’ (rock salt). At one such shop on Boring Road, a pack of 200grams of makhana lachha prepared with sendha namak is available at Rs 90 and that of badaam lachha at Rs 130. Potato chips have been christened as phalhari chips as they have been prepared using ‘sendha namak’.
