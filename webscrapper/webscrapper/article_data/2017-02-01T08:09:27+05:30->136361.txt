KOLKATA: Contrary to the usual complaint against police inaction, the high court on Tuesday sounded a caution to the   over its going overboard on a simple case. It is relating to an unauthorised construction that the   has already pulled down.On getting a complaint from the KMC, police sprung to action and issued an arrest of warrant against Sisir Bajoria, who is now with the BJP.Sensing trouble, Bajoria moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail.

 While granting the anticipatory bail, a division bench of Justice   and Justice   took exception to the police activism, even after the KMC had pulled down an unauthorised construction at Bajoria's Hare Street office. “The KMC has already demolished the construction.The police is going overboard. Don't jump into the case.Police have many things to do. Treat it as a normal case,“ the bench held. The response came after Bajoria's lawyer Abhrajit Mitra submitted to the court that the law enforcing authorities have already demolished the construction. “Why did the police have to issue a warrant of arrest? Is my client a criminal?“ Mitra argued. The court didn't even allow the government pleader to argue his case while granting the bail. The case will, however, continue as a natural process.
 
 Bajoria, who is out of town, was not available for comment. While welcoming the high court order, BJP leader   said: “The high court's observation today is an indictment of the partisan role the police administration is playing. Policemen get over active against the opposition when they look the other way in cases where the ruling party is involved. Even the high court has come to know of this. The state government needs to take a lesson from the court observation and behave,“ Sinha said.
