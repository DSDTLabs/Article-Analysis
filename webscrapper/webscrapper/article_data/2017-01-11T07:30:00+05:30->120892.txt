CHANDIGARH: Reacting to Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s appeal to people of Punjab to cast their votes as if to make AAP supremo   the chief minister,   president Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said, “Kejriwal has finally exposed his obsessive and abominable lust for Punjab’s chief ministerial position.”

 Accusing the AAP leader for misleading the people of the state with his shameful lies to the contrary, Amarinder said Kejriwal had proved what the Congress had maintained all along. Kejriwal’s “ugly intentions” were thoroughly exposed with this development and “shown what a slimy liar the Delhi chief minister is,” he said in a statement.
 
 The Congress leader accused the AAP leader of playing unabashedly with the sentiments of the people ever since he stepped on its soil, saying he had his eyes on the top post in Punjab. He cautioned the people of Punjab against “biting the carrots Arvind Kejriwal has been dangling in front of them with his false claims”. He maintained that Kejriwal, who is known for cheating and defrauding people in Delhi, where AAP is in government, had been resorting to similar tactics in Punjab which he wanted to grab by hook or crook. 
 
 From his lies on chief ministerial and deputy chief ministerial posts for Punjab to his conflicting statements on SYL and other issues, Kejriwal had all along been trying to befool the people in a desperate bid to seize power in the state and exploit it for personal gains after having failed to realise his dirty plans in Delhi, Amarinder said.
 
 Amarinder claimed that Kejriwal had no interest in the welfare of the state and its people as had become amply clear in the recent months with his turning a blind eye to role of his party leaders in corruption and sex scandals. Besides, he added, AAP did not even have its own cadre in Punjab and was getting people from other states to work for it during the elections.
