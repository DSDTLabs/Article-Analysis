AMARAVATI: The game of one-upmanship between the ruling   (TDP) and opposition   has put the   in a tight spot as they are under immense pressure to remove illegal liquor outlets - popularly known as belt shops - across the state. However, officials are worried not just about a loss in revenue but also about having to face the wrath of local public representatives. 

 Interestingly, field-level leaders from both ruling and opposition parties are extending their full support to liquor merchants and are exerting pressure on department officials not to intervene in their business operations. It is an open secret that many legislators and former legislators cutting across political spectrum have direct stakes in liquor trade. 
 
 CM  's directive to the excise and prohibition department not to spare illegal liquor shops is creating ripples in the department. The CM's decision, taken at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, has prompted the ruling and opposition parties to engage in a bitter war of words to claim credit. While YSRCP claimed the CM took the decision after their party chief   vowed to enforce prohibition if voted to power, the TDP hit back saying CM took a courageous step to root out menace of illegal liquor shops after receiving requests from women .
 
 Sources say the excise department is in a state of chaos as no decision is being implemented smoothly for the last two years. The confusion at top had complicated the issue of granting licenses to shops and crackdown on illegal outlets is going to further rattle the department.
 
 The number of illegal shops would be anywhere between 5-10 times the number of licensed shops.
