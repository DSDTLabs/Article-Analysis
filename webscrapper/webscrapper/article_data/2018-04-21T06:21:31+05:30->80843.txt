AHMEDABAD: CID (crime) on Friday produced  , the Amreli local crime branch (LCB)  , who is the prime accused in the Rs 12 crore  , at the city sessions court on Friday evening and secured his custody for seven days. The investigating agency is yet to nab seven other accused, all of them constables with Amreli police.

 “He was questioned at Ahmedabad crime branch and later at the CID office. He stated that he went on the run when he learned that it was likely that an FIR would be filed in the case. He says he had gone to Rajasthan for one day. Afterward that, he remained in and around Ahmedabad,” said a senior CID official.
 
 Investigators said Patel’s mobile phone has been seized and sent for forensic analysis, to ascertain who he was in touch with over in the last month. Officials don’t deny the possibility that Patel may have switched his phone — knowing the technical tools investigators are likely to use. Investigators hope to answer the most pressing questions — whose directions Patel was acting on, when and how did he communicate with the constables about the ‘operation’ near Gandhinagar and who was involved apart from those named in the FIR.
 
 Sources said Patel’s flight to Mumbai and contact with other accused, especially Ketan Patel, a Surat-based lawyer, may hold the key to understanding the case. The roles of the Amreli SP and a former   are already under the scanner. CID kept mum about Patel’s friend, whose digital wallet was allegedly used.
