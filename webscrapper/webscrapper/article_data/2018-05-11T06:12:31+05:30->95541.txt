AHMEDABAD: Annoyed with the police department’s inaction against bootleggers,   high court has asked the state government whether it has any plan to create a mechanism to monitor “designed FIRs”, in which   are shown fleeing the spot despite police having specific prior information about movement of liquor consignments.

 A week ago, Justice S H   had warned against the practice adopted by cops to shield bootleggers and had called for a need to take action against policemen who indulge in such practice. The high court had specifically pointed out to FIRs filed in a fixed format after liquor seizure and bootlegger’s escape.
 
 On Wednesday, Justice Vora asked the state government “to appraise the court whether it contemplates to put in practice any in-house mechanism to monitor such ‘designed FIR’ (escaping accused despite prior information)”.
 
 Stating that it is time for the state government to take steps against the practice of filing designed FIRs and the court cannot pass specific order in absence of information, the HC has sought all details from the state government about FIRs registered in prohibition cases in last one year, names of the bootleggers escaped in the incidents, vehicles caught ferrying liquor, names and designation of cops involved in the raid etc. The HC has sought these details by June 30.
 
 While granting bail to an alleged bootlegger caught in   town in the border district of  , Justice Vora said, “The flow of designed FIRs is not recent practice adopted by many police stations, but is in place since long as if it has now become “custom” while dealing with prior information with regard to movement of liquor in the State. Had there been any in-house mechanism to monitor such custom, filing of designed FIRs would have been controlled to great extent and/or concerned police would not have ventured to file such FIR.”
