MUMBAI: Western Railway’s   system, installed in some   compartments for security, has been deemed a “success” and the administration has decided to use it in all   in future.

 A rake which allows women commuters in distress to communicate with the train guard in an emergency was introduced on Women’s Day on March 8. Another rake with a similar system was introduced on March 21. Each ladies coach has four cameras. The installation cost in both rakes is estimated to be Rs25lakh.
 
 A senior WR official said, “So far, there has been no misuse of the system. Hence, we have in principle decided to extend the technology to all rakes in a phased manner.”
 
 Officials said apart from the ladies  , it can be introduced in coaches reserved for the handicapped, as there have been instances of able-bodied people entering them. Physically challenged persons can contact the guard to report such cases, besides alerting him about any untoward incident in the compartment.
 
 WR estimates that the cost of installing the technology across rakes will be Rs10-12crore. He said. “The expenditure is worth the technology and the benefit that comes with it in terms of enhanced security.”
 
 WR had launched the talk-back system in the ladies coaches in a suburban rake as a pilot project. Under the  , as soon as commuters try to communicate through the speaker, the guard receives an audio and visual indication on the cab control panel and assistance can be provided at the next station.
 
 The decision to install the system was taken after incidents of molestation in running trains in broad daylight recently. The system is similar to the one use in the Metro. The air-conditioned local, which is yet to commence service, also has the system.
