Trichy: Revenue officials busted an illegal sand mining racket and seized four sand-laden trucks near KK Nagar in Trichy around midnight on Wednesday.

 Acting on information provided by an anonymous caller, a team of revenue officials led by Srirangam tahsildar M Shanmugam rushed to Kolukkattaikudi and Thorakudi near KK Nagar.
 
 They searched the areas mentioned by the anonymous caller. Their effort didn’t yield any result at first. Later, the tahsildar got another call from someone asking him to trace the trucks behind the bushes in the same area.
 
 The team searched and found four trucks. The team surrounded the trucks. On seeing the officials, the drivers of the trucks fled the scene.
 
 The officials seized the trucks and brought them to the Srirangam tahsildar office with the help of drivers of the department.
 
 Tahsildar Shanmugam said each truck was loaded with three units of river sand. All the sand was dumped on the premises of the Srirangam tahsildar office on Thursday. 
 
 It was found that the sand was stolen from Koraiyaaru river in the area. In order to avoid getting caught, the locals took the sand from the river and dumped them in some other area to enable the trucks to gain easy access to it during the night time. 
 
 The tahsildar also recalled few other incidences of raid and the seizure of sand dumped in the area. 
 
 He said that those involved in illegal sand mining operated with spies to inform them about the arrival of the revenue officials. “They would post the spies in KK Nagar area to check if the officials are coming to raid the area. If we get the information and go there, we cannot find the trucks but for the sand dumped there,” he said
 
 The officials said that they were looking for the owners of the trucks. The collector asked the tahsildar to lodge a complaint with the police.
