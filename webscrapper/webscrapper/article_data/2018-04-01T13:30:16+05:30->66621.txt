Pegasus is the children's book imprint of the Indian Publisher B. Jain Publishing Group. They had published a book titled   targeted towards children which had biographies of 11 people considered as great world leaders. The list includes Napoleon Bonaparte, Mahatma Gandhi, and even recent leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi and Barack Obama.  Among these great leaders was also included Adolf Hitler and was even featured on the cover. This has sparked wide outrage as Hitler is mostly considered a villain in history as his actions led to the death of millions, not just in the second world war but in the horrifying Nazi holocaust. According to the book description of the leaders chosen, “some are famous, others little known, but all of them energise their followers and try to make the world better”. However, a book that calls Hitler great which is directed towards those of an impressionable age might skew their understanding of his actions and their consequences. Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in the US said the description of Hitler as “dedicated to the betterment of countries and people” would “bring tears of joy to the Nazis and their racist neo-Nazi heirs”. Anshu Juneja, Pegasus’s publishing director, in an interview with  earlier this month, said Hitler was included in the book because “his leadership skills and speeches influenced masses”.
