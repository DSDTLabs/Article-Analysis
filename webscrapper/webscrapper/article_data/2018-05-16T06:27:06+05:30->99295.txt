MUMBAI:   has advised the BJP to go for the ballot paper system to allay widespread apprehension about the   machine in polls. On the other hand,   president Raj Thackeray, in a tweet, hasattributed BJP's handsome show in   to EVM.

 
 Reacting to BJP's win in the Karnataka assembly elections the results for which were out on Tuesday, Uddhav Thackeray said the BJP should declare that it would conduct the general poll through the ballot paper system. "This will help remove doubts about the EVM," said the   president. He congratulated all those who won the Karnataka assembly elections, including the BJP and the Congress Party.
 
 Stating that the BJP may be on a winning spree in assembly elections, but it loses by-elections, Uddhav Thackeray expressed confidence that the Sena would win the Palghar Lok Sabha by-poll to be held this month.
 
 The Sena has fielded its candidate in Palghar which is BJP's seat. Angered by Sena's move, the BJP has fielded its own nominee and so has the Congress Party.
