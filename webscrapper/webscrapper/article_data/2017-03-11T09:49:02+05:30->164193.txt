HYDERABAD: The decision of the government to not allow any protests at Dharna Chowk near Indira Park came under fire on Friday from opposition parties who called the move dictatorial and undemocratic. 

  state president,  , said his party strongly condemns the move to prevent anyone from protesting at Dharna Chowk. "A party that came to power with the impact of protests and agitation now wants to take away the democratic right to protest from the people," Laxman said. The right to protest is a Constitutional right and the TRS government is trampling on this freedom of the people, he added.
 
 Making plans to shift the location where people can protest to outskirts of the city is nothing but robbing people of their avenue to bring an issue to the notice of people at large. "The government must withdraw all its plans to shift Dharna Chowk from its current location," he demanded.
 
  deputy leader in   P,  , called the government plan to ban all protests at Dharna Chowk 'draconian'. The logic being put forward by the government that Dharna Chowk is in the vicinity of the Assembly and protests there can create law and order problems was not valid.
