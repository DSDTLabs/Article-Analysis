HYDERABAD: It was the   that developed Hyderabad, Hi-Tec City and   airport, and the state capital is on the international map due to this reason, said AP chief minister N  . 

 
 "I want to see both Hyderabad and Amaravati as No 1 and No 2 cities in the country. It was because of the development of Hi-Tec City by the TDP government headed by me that software giants like Microsoft opened their centres in Hyderabad and ensured that the city became known internationally," the TDP chief said at the Telangana Mahanadu here on Thursday.
 
 "When I was the chief minister of united AP, I conducted about 80 surprise inspections in the city. Nine surrounding municipalities were merged in Hyderabad. The international airport at Shamshabad, eight-lane ORR and brining Krishna waters to the city were initiated by the TDP. I initiated the metro rail project when I was CM but it got delayed due to corrupt   government...As a result of TDP's efforts, the service sector became key to the generation of the city's revenue," he said.
 
 "Before the TDP government came to power, communal riots were common and curfew would be enforced once every six months in Old City. The TDP government put an end to this," he said. 
 
 Naidu said lift irrigation projects like Alimineti Madhava Reddy Project, Kalwakurthy, Nettampadu and Devadulu were initiated by him. 
 
 Interestingly, Naidu did not name TRS nor criticise the state government. He assured he would devote more time to Telangana unit of the TDP in the near future.
