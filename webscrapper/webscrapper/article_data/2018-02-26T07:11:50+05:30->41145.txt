MADURAI: Archaeologists have unearthed hero and sati stones, two finely carved sculptures with inscriptions believed to be used in the   period, at   near   in Tuticorin district. While the hero stone was thought to have been erected in honour of soldiers or chieftains killed in war, the sati stone had been put up for women performing the once-sacred ritual in the country. 

 Chennai-based Tamil scholar and archaeologist   and her assistant  , an archaeology enthusiast, spotted these ancient stones during one of their field visits in the region recently. Priya said both the hero stone and sati stones were spotted side by side at Sangampatti and were worshipped by the local residents. “Among the stones, we have studied, these are finest ones with so much of detail” she said.
 
 The hero stone depicts a battle scene where two soldiers are fighting each other with swords and bow and arrow. On top, heavenly maidens are receiving them with garlands, indicating that they had died in a battle. Sati stone is even finer with details where the man is seen wearing long robe adorned with many ornaments. With a long bow in hand, it could be deduced that he should have been someone important in the locality.
 
 His wife is standing nearby holding a water lilly in hand, a typical indication of Sati stone. A woman holding lilly in hand is the sign that she committed Sati, Priya added. There are other figures carved in the stone like those of a man and another couple. “They are evidence from past, narrating their tales to us,” she said.
