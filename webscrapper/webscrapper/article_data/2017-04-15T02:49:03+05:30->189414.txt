NAVI MUMBAI: While BEST has decided to suspend its   operations from Monday to cut losses, NMMT is planning to restructure the tariff of its fleet of 80 buses due to stiff competition from app-based taxi operators like Ola and Uber. 

 BEST had managed to increase its passenger count with a 50% reduction in tariff for morning and afternoon services. It is essential to understand if more taxi services have led to a decline in ticket revenue for BEST, NMMT general manager Shirish Aradwad said.
 
 NMMT officials said they would discuss several issues with the municipal commissioner in the coming week and then take up restructuring of short-and-long distance ticket tariffs for air-conditioned buses plying on eight routes.
 
 “There has been a reduction in the earnings from AC bus services from Rs 55 to Rs 45 per km in the last financial year,” an official said.
 
 The daily earnings on an average was Rs 11 lakh per km that has now dipped to Rs 9 lakh. But, there’s a scope to encourage passengers to travel by buses by restructuring the ticket fare and fight the competition from taxis. We are looking at that option.
 
 NMMT officials have attributed the loss to short-distance commuters have started availing share taxi operations in the city. 
 
 “We are looking at reducing the short-distance fare and increasing the long distance ticket tariff for  ,’’ an NMMT official said.
 
 For instance, the bus fare from Vashi to Belapur is Rs 50 but an individual can go for a taxi ride that will charge the commuter Rs 25 with the meter reading being Rs 100. The commuter thus saves 50% of his one-way travel cost.
 
 Similarly, if one was travelling from Kharghar to Borivli the bus fare would be Rs 120 while a taxi ride would be somewhere between Rs 400 and Rs 500. 
 
 While NMMT plies around 70 AC buses daily, around 15,000 commuters take the service every day. Around 2,70,000 passengers take around 320 NMMT bus services that hit city roads daily.
