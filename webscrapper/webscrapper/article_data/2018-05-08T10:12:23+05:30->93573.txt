VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N   on Monday said performing states should not be penalised by the Centre by imposing unnecessary conditions.

 Delivering the keynote address at the second conclave of finance ministers in   on Monday, Naidu said the   should not consider the 2011 population base as that would deprive the states of powers and there would be a danger of reduction in MP and MLA seats.
 
 
  
 “Poorly performing states must be uplifted, but not at the cost of progressive states. A new paradigm for devolution must be established in the spirit of partnership between the Centre and the states, and not based on dominance of the former over the latter,” Naidu stated.
 
 
 The CM asked the Union government to respect cooperative federalism when the states are functioning on national agenda. “I hope the common memorandum is that we will work on today’s acts as a starting point for fresh thinking in regard to devolution in recognition of the growing reality of states being more than equal partners in the development of the country,” he said. He also called upon the states to meet President   and apprise him of the issues.
