LUCKNOW: Upset over constant squabbling between their parents, two minor sisters, aged 5 and 11, left their home on Thursday, leaving their mother in panic and sent city cops into a tizzy. 

 Police launched a massive search operation fearing any mishap with the sisters amid increasing incidents of crime against women and minors being reported of late, and felt immensely relieved on recovering them safe and unharmed after a 10-hour hunt.
 
 The two sisters left their home at Martinpurwa in the afternoon after their parents fought once again. 
 
 Their mother, a domestic help, works at some houses in Narahi. She leaves around 8am and returns at 11.30am once before going again for evening. On returning, the mother panicked on not finding her daughters home and informed police. 
 
  The police control room instantly relayed information to all city police stations and the incident was sounded out to senior officials. IG, Lucknow range, Sujeet Pandey constituted five teams under ASP, east, Sarvesh Mishra and deputed one of them at Drishti, the surveillance centre of Lucknow Police where live feed of   cameras is beamed. The crime branch was also roped in. 
 
  The police learnt that the girls were seen riding a bicycle on Lohia Path, had crossed   crossing and went towards Fun Republic but could not be traced further. 
 
 Policemen combed colonies off Lohia Path till a betel shop owner said he had seen them heading towards polytechnic. Cops finally found them around 8pm, playing near a 'mazaar' under Vibhutikhand police station area. SHO Vibhutikhand Brijesh Rai passed on the information on wireless.
 
 IG Pandey said, "The girls were upset with parents. Their mother separated from her first husband and they used to fight whenever he visited home. We called up Childline counsellors before handing them to their mother."
 
 "The girls borrowed a bicycle from a neighbour and left home as they did not like constant squabbling," said ASP Sarvesh Mishra.
