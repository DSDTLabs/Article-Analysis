Panaji: The list of corporations to be allotted to MLAs of the ruling coalition has been finalized, but a formal announcement is likely to be made next week. 

 “It has been decided who will get what, but orders will be issued next week,” chief minister Manohar Parrikar said. He was speaking after the swearing-in ceremony of Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho and former Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane.
 
 Orders appointing Nilesh Cabral as chairman, Goa Tourism Development Corporation, and Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker as chairman, Economic Development Corporation (EDC) has already been issued, Parrikar said, while not commenting on the corporation to be allotted to Mormugao MLA and former power minister Milind Naik. With most of the heavy weight corporations taken, it remains to be seen what Naik will be allotted.
 
 Calangute MLA and deputy speaker Michael Lobo is likely to be head the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA), sources said.
 
 No decision has been taken with regards to Human Resource Development Corporation (HRDC), Sewerage and Infrastructure Development Corporation (SIDC) Ltd, Info Tech Corporation of Goa and planning bodies like South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA) and Mormugao Planning and Development Authority.
