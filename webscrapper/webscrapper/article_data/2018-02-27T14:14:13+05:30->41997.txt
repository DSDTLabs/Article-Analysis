VISAKHAPATNAM: In a huge relief for thousands of research aspirants,   finally released the   of its Research Common Entrance (RCET) on Monday.

 Aspirants can exercise web options from March 5 to 9 and the seats will be allocated on March 19. Students have to submit their original certificates and pay their fees between March 26 and April 2. Counselling and allotment for the physically challenged category will be conducted on April 4.
 
 The varsity first took a beating when the   (APSCHE) in January asked all state varsities, including Andhra University, to keep the research admissions in abeyance to pave way for a common research admission test. This cast a shadow of doubt among research aspirants as the APSCHEâ€™s directive meant that they would have to sit for another entrance test to take admission into Andhra University. Later on, varsity officials successfully pursued the matter with the APSCHE and secured exemption for the RCET for this time.
 
 However, the varsity hit another roadblock due to its own internal issues. After the written examination for 90 marks, there was an oral examination for 10 marks, which was conducted in the departments concerned.
 
 However, a professor of a particular department not awarding marks brought the whole process to a standstill. Due to the same issue, the varsity could not release the full-time research admissions of that particular department, which were released for other departments about two months ago. It has delayed the total process for more than 20 days. However, later, the officials convinced the professor and released the results on Monday.
 
 Directorate of Admissions head Prof K Rajendra Prasad said all candidates are directed to exercise web options during the scheduled period.
