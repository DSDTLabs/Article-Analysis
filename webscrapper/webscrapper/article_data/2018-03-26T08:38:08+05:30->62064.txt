Mumbai: It’s exactly a year to this week when Australian media – touring India back in March 2017 during the Test series – had compared captain Virat Kohli to American president Donald Trump. 

 
 
 In doing so, they – like their Indian counterparts – remained witness to one of the most bitterly fought contests, one that also included the controversial ‘Dressing Room Review’ episode.
 
  
  
 
 The Australia camp referred the moment as a mere ‘brain fade’ when the young   – 25 years of age back then, the same as   now – took the blame for his Steve Smith’s DRS fiasco and said it was he who suggested that the skipper refer to the Australian dressing room after being adjudged lbw.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Handscomb then and Bancroft now, Australia, and more importantly Smith’s dependency on 25-year-olds to come to his aid during questionable moments says much about the pattern this Australian side has set for itself, a lot on the lines of ingraining a culture as early as possible in a cricketer’s career. 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 On Saturday, if Smith, or Australia’s ‘leadership team’, had decided to ‘cheat’ anyway, the question is why did they not put the responsibility on a senior cricketer to do so instead of Bancroft, whose career – barely beginning – will now be seen in this light forever. To make matters worse, ICC’s elite panel umpire Nigel Llong, who is officiating the Test match in Cape Town between Australia and South Africa, was the field umpire during the Bengaluru Test. 
 
 And for the record, Llong did not submit a report of the ‘dressing room review’ to match referee Broad, despite Smith’s own admission that he suffered a ‘brain freeze’.
 
 It is time for Australia, as an entire unit, to do some soul searching on these string of episodes instead of blaming other boards, other cricketers and foreign media at all times.
