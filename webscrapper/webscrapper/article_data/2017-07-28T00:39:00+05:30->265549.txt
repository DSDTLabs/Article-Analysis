Chandigarh: Though heavy rains brought relief from the hot and humid weather, it soon turned out to be a nightmare for those who commute on CTU buses. The condition of the buses is said to be pitiable with water dripping at the doors of the buses and on window seats, making it difficult for daily commuters.

 With water dripping from the roofs of the buses, those travelling in these were compelled to stand, leading to a huge chaos within the bus. Seats in many high-end AC buses (red colour) of the CTU were found sagged and wet due to continuous dripping of water on these and even on the steering wheels.
 
 Buses like bus no. 203 (ISBT 43 to Mansa Devi), bus no. 26 (PGI to Dhakoli), bus no. 206-A (ISBT 43 to IT Park) were found to be the worst with water dripping on aisles also, making it even worse for the passengers.
 
 “There is not much space to sit due to constant water dripping, making all seats wet and we have to stand till we reach our destination,” said Rajiv Shukla, a resident of Mansa Devi Complex. He further added, “The aisles got overcrowded as no one was sitting on the wet window seats.” Some passengers filed complaints with the help centre in this regard, but to no avail. “I went to the help centre to convey that bus no. 26 has problem of water dripping from the roof, due to which many are not able to sit on the seats. But people here prefer to turn a deaf ear to it by stating that it is a normal problem during rains,” said Rajesh Poddar, who is a daily traveller on bus no. 26.
 
 As if this was not enough, waterlogging in the inner segment of the ISBT 17 left the people in a state of disarray. The rain water reached up to the brim of the main corridors, making it difficult for the people to walk with heavy luggage.
