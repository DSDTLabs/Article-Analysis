Veteran actor Y Gee Mahendra’s passion for the performing arts is well known. But, did you know that the dramatist is also a good instrumentalist?   recently played the tabla while singers performed Thamizhukkum Amudhendru Per on a TV show. The special programme — Thirai Isaiyil Tamizh Chuvai — will be aired on PuthuYugam this weekend, and revolves around popular songs that focused on ‘Tamizh’.

 Senthil Sangerthanam, producer of the show, tells us, “The idea of the programme is to celebrate Tamizh on Tamizh New Year (April 14). We’ve rounded up about eight film songs that focused on ‘Tamizh’ — like Sange Muzhangu, Sindhu Nadhiyin Isai, Vanakkam Palamurai, Senthamizh Thenmozhiyal, Vanna Vanna Sol Eduthu, Aarodum Mannil and Thamizhukkum Amudhendru Per among others — and our sentiments, and invited   sir to share interesting trivia about them. His knowledge of films is amazing and as someone who has been part of the industry for so many years, he could give us details about these numbers that not many are aware of. The format is such that the singers will render a song, and then, YGM will share titbits about it. During one such rendition, of Tamizhukku Amudhendru Per, the anchor requests him to play the tabla and he gladly obliges, playing for the pallavi and charanam. He even whistles the tune of Aarodum Mannil during the show.”
