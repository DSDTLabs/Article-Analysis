HOWRAH: Police probing into the mysterious death of bank facilitator, Rajat Chowdhury, have summoned four persons including two bank officials, a businessman and his staff for questioning. The victim had in a Facebook post named three fellow employees for allegedly forcing him to confess his involvement in laundering scrapped currency. Chowdhury’s mutilated body was found on the railway track near Uluberia on Saturday.

 Chowdhury had made the Facebook post after a businessman, Somnath Ghosh, filed a complaint against him claiming he had handed the facilitator several lakhs in Rs 100 notes but it had been deposited in old 500- and 1000- rupee notes. This lead to a notice from the income tax department. Chowdhury in the post had claimed that he was being framed.
 
 Investigators probing the case realized that bank rules do not allow facilitators to handle another depositor’s cash. The bank’s regional manager, Rajesh Kumar, had confirmed the fact. Police are now trying to find out who authorized Chowdhury to collect cash from the businessman and deposit it at the UBI Uluberia branch.
 
 Summons issued by police to UBI Uluberia branch manager Chinmay Dutta and cashier Raju Pramanik is to ascertain who asked Chowdhury to pick up the cash and deposit it. 
 
 Police have also summoned businessman Somnath Ghosh and his manager Amit Nayek. 
 
 Police have already questioned Dutta once but are far from satisfied with his answers. They feel Chowdhury could not have operated without the bank officials’ knowledge. When TOI contacted Dutta on Tuesday, he said he was busy with bank work. On what he intended to do next, he replied: “I would take the next step after consulting my lawyer.”
 
 Chowdhury’s family alleged that senior bank officials were not willing to hear them out. “We tried to speak to the bank’s regional manager but we were not successful,” said Chowdhury’s nephew Bappa.
