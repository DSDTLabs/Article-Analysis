Men are less likely to do it than women, and mixed-sex pairs least likely of all. It is surprisingly common among pedestrians. What we’re talking about is a new form of human behaviour, and its called “phone walking” — essentially holding a phone for long periods of time without actually using it.

  and   at the   at Chicago studied over 3,000 adult pedestrians at six city center locations in Paris. Just over half the pedestrians were female, with an average age of about 35. The results make for interesting reading. Of the total adults observed, 674 were phone walkers — a surprisingly large 22%.
 
 
 There were significant differences between the sexes. In total, around 20% of men were phone walkers, compared with 33% women. However, phone walking was dramatically less common in mixed pairs: just 18%. An important factor is likely to be whether the man and woman are a romantic couple which could impact their phone-holding behaviour. Researchers feel phone walking is prevalent because people feel the need to make it clear to themselves, and to those observing them, that they are available and ready to receive communication.That would explain why so many people are phone walkers in the first place.
