THANE: With the civic elections just three days away, residents residing in plush areas of the city, including Vasant Vihar and Upvan, have begun mapping the string of poll promises to see which candidate will be able to provide them with three main facilities—better public   and connectivity, regular water supply and healthcare facilities.

 While the private enclaves of   number 5 boast of its well maintained gardens, decent civic schools, wide roads with big footpaths, safety signages and no traffic congestion; basic provisions like water, transport and health centres seems to have taken a back seat.
 
 Despite getting water supply from the civic body, these areas depend mostly on borewells and water tankers, especially during summer. The shoddy bus facilities, too, has forced most residents to use private vehicles, if not rickshaws.
 
 The only   health care centre available in this ward is in Yeoor Village and the only doctor available here visits the clinic for just an hour daily. Vasnat Vihar resident Jai Shinde said, “Bus services are bad so we have to depend on autos or our own vehicles to travel.” 
 
 The sewage lines of this region are connected with the main civic drainage lines and the solid waste is also regularly picked up by the ghanta gadis. However, residents of Gawand Baug continue to dump waste in the nullah.
