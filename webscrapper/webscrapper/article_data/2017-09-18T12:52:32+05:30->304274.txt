It seems like   and   are Best Friends Forever!

  The Disney child stars have practically grown up in the spotlight together and the songstress used Jonas's 25th birthday to remind the world of their lengthy history.
 
  
  
  The singer took to Instagram and wrote, "Happy birthday to one of my absolute best friends @nickjonas. Many ups and downs over the last 11 years together but we're still here for one another no matter what. Hope you have an amazing year, you deserve it!"
 
  
  
  Nick's brother   also wished the 'Bacon' hit-maker with a heartfelt wish on the photo sharing app.
  He wrote, "Happy Birthday to my best friend/brother @nickjonas you are wise beyond your years. You continue to impress and inspire me and those around you. Have the best day and plenty of Coors lights. I'll make sure of it since I'm sitting right next to you right now. Here's to another great year."
 
  
  
  His 25th year certainly got off to a rock star start considering he hit the stage Saturday night at Angel Stadium in Anaheim.
 
  The Grammy nominee performed an end-of-game concert on the field in honor of Strike Out Slavery, which was founded by Angels player   and his wife, Deidre.
