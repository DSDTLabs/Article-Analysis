BENGALURU: The Karnataka State Primary Teachers' Association h as proposed to the education department to admit children aged five years to Class 1 in   and open pre-primary section. 

 Earlier, government schools admitted children aged 5 years, 5 months, at the primary level, and this was valid till 2016-17. But this year, the education department changed the age bar - children who have completed 5 years, 10 months can be admitted in Class 1. On Saturday, the association said that there has been a shortfall in enrolment in government schools due to this change in policy.
 
 "Kids older than five years cannot be kept in anganwadis and parents of such kids are sending them to private schools. Some parents are also pushing them into child labour," the proposal says. The teachers' association has also demanded that the department start pre-primary sections - nursery, lower and upper kindergarten in government schools.
 
 Shalini Rajneesh, principal secretary to the primary and secondary education department said, "I received their representation on Saturday and will put it up with the new minister, who will take charge now after government formation." She said that as per protocol, the department cannot make any decisions now.
