BATHINDA:  , the sarpanch of   (a village in Moga district) — who had earlier protested for the restoration of power supply to his village waterworks — trimmed his beard on Thursday after the district administration failed to fulfil its promise, despite the orders of the deputy commissioner (DC). He also staged a sit-in outside the DC’s office, and tied a tuft of his beard’s hair on the door of the Moga district administrative complex, which was removed immediately.

 Some Sikh organizations objected to Harbhajan’s action, after which he tendered an apology for hurting their religious sentiments. The power supply was eventually restored on Friday, and the administration called upon Bahona residents to bring water for the sarpanch.   had stated on Thursday: “The DC had directed officials to restore power supply for the waterworks. But the officials deceived me, and it was not restored. I will not stop my protest till the supply is restored, and villagers bring water for me.”
 
  said: “The water supply could not be restored yesterday (Thursday). However, it has been restored today (Friday), and people of the village have been asked to get water for Harbhajan from the waterworks.”
