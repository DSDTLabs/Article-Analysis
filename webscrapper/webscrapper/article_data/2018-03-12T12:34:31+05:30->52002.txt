HYDERABAD: A   (Maha Prasthanam) is coming up at   Hindu Smashanavatika within five months.

 This is the second modern crematorium in the city after the one in Jubilee Hills. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is executing the project.
 
  
 The proposal to construct a modern crematorium came up after chief minister  , who was visited Panjagutta graveyard to attend the funeral of Governor’s mother in October 2017, emphasised the need for a crematorium with modern facilities.
 
 The GHMC swung into action and identified about one acre land adjacent to the existing electric crematorium. The civic body started the work and construction is going on briskly.
 
 “Maha Prasthanam is a corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative to upgrade and modernise the crematorium at Panjagutta. The construction was entrusted to Phoenix Foundation. It had constructed   at Jubilee Hills in the city. The modern crematorium is eco-friendly. It has been spruced up to give an aesthetic look,” said P Chinna Reddy, GHMC executive engineer and in-charge of Panjagutta Maha Prasthanam.
 
 The civic body faced stiff resistance from locals, who are opposed to the modern crematorium. The civic body held talks with the locals and sorted out the issue.
 
 Panjagutta Hindu Smashanavatika in-charge A Lakshmi said, “there is opposition to the new crematorium. Some workers may lose their jobs as the civic body plans to hand over the maintenance to a private firm. We met KT   and urged him to protect our jobs.”
 
 She said Panjagutta graveyard is spread over 66 acres. It is protected by Lakshmi’s family for more than six decades. At present there are nine burning platforms, wash rooms and 30 lockers to keep ashes. There is also facility to transport bodies to the crematorium.
