 fans got to see the actor recently in a different look, as he flaunted a salt and pepper look, in a red overcoat and specs. The   team had another reason to rejoice, as the film completed 150 days of its screening in theatres. With its celeb cast gathering together to share the joy, the bash looked as grand as the film itself. 

 While the actor stole hearts at the event with his persona, junior Pulimurugan Ajaz also dazzled, in a shiny coat and suit. 
 Dance and music shows followed, and everyone was in a celebratory mood. While the director of the film Vysakh, music composer Gopi Sunder, actor Vinu Mohan made their presence felt, one couldnâ€™t take their eyes off the female lead of the movie, Kamalinee Mukherjee, who enchanted one and all in a multi-coloured sari. Anjali appeared no less a doll in a pretty pink gown. Actors Dileep, Mukesh and Jewel Mary were also seen cheering for the team while Namitha set the stage on fire with her energetic dance moves.
