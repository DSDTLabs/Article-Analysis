Ludhiana: The zonal unit of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Ludhiana, raided four city-based cycle parts manufacturers and traders on Wednesday.

 The department officials said they got a tip-off that these companies were evading huge amounts of custom duty on the import of cycle parts.
 
 DRI sleuths under instructions from additional director general (ADG) Naveen K Jain searched 12 premises located on Gill Road and Focal Point belonging to these four companies and took in their possession documents and financial records of these companies.
 
 Some cycle parts traders were seen lowering their shutters the moment the news of raids spread in the Gill Road market. Although DRI officials are tight lipped over their investigation, sources said these firms were under-billing their import purchases to fleece the government and were paying less customs duty than the actual amount due from them.
 
 Sources said the import of items like sewing machine parts, auto parts, cycle parts from countries like China into Ludhiana has risen sharply in the past few years and the under-billing has become a common practice by a large number of importers which helps them cut the cost of the products which they import.
 
 As per data provided by Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), total imports during the year 2010-11 at Inland Container Depot (ICD), Ludhiana were Rs. 6308.30 crores which shot up to Rs. 10,728 crores during 2014-15.
