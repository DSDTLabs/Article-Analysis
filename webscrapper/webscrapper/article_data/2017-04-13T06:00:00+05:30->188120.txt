Since making her debut with Andala Rakshasi in 2012,   has "always played haughty characters with a serious disposition." So when a character of an "innocent-happy-go-lucky girl" in the Varun Tej-starrer Mister came her way, the 26-year-old didn’t let the opportunity slip by. “My character Chandramukhi is a far cry from anything I’ve played till date. She is very child-like at heart and believes that everybody around is good natured by default. So when I heard director   narrate the role, I said yes immediately,” says the actress, smiling. 
Elaborating more on her character, Lavanya adds, “Chandramukhi is from a royal family, so my styling is very regal. So there is nothing amiss about her ever (laughs). I will be seen wearing a lot of heavy jewellery, colourful lehengas and half-sarees.”
 Produced by Tagore Madhu and Nallamalapu Bujji on Lakshmi Narasimha Productions, Mister, which is releasing on April 14, is a love triangle that features   playing the second lead. “Both Hebah and me share equal screen space and we have a few scenes together as well. Honestly, it was a lot of fun working with her,” says Lavanya, adding, “It’s a different kind of love story loaded with plenty of unexpected twists and turns. You won’t find a single dull moment and I’m sure, sure everybody will enjoy it.” 
 What Lavanya enjoyed the most was “dancing on a bus” for the romantic number,  . “When I got to know that the song will be picturised on a bus, and I got really excited. I wasn’t scared at all, in fact, this is something I always wanted to do. It was so much fun.”
 Lavanya is all praise for her co-star, Varun. “Varun is a very talented actor and a supportive co-star, but not many people know that he has a mischievous streak. He is a big prankster and has a very dry sense of humour. I had a great time working with him,” she says, signing off.
