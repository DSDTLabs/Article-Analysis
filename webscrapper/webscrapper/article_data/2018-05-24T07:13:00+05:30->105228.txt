GURUGRAM: The bogus call centre in Sector 33 (institutional sector), which is suspected to have cheated hundreds of US citizens by using threats of punishment for tax evasion, was using ‘hawala’ channels to divert the money in India.

 The fraudsters trained youngsters to speak in English with an American accent, and then make random calls to US citizens posing as   (IRS) officials, and threatening them with raids if they didn’t pay up through wire transfers or purchase of $50-200 iTunes or online store gift cards for the fake   officials. With the help of their US contacts, the suspects then sold the cards for cash, which was then transferred to Ahmedabad or Delhi via informal hawala channels. They avoided banking transactions to escape the eyes of investigative agencies in US and India.
 
 “After getting iTunes or gift cards, the fraudsters had them sold in the US, the cash collected and transferred to India via hawala,” said a senior police officer who is part of the probe. Police sources said their informers in hawala networks tipped them off about the operation. “We were tipped off about hawala transactions linked to the call centre,” he added.
 
 The investigation revealed the call centre owner used to provide a list of US citizens and their details on email to  , one of the three executives arrested on Tuesday, who assigned call centre employees to make fake calls as IRS officials. Every day, the call centre made dozens of calls to US citizens, and managed to cheat 6-7 people daily. It’s believed the fraudsters have collected crores of rupees by cheating US citizens. Police are trying to assess the quantum of money involved, and examining bank records of all three arrested.
