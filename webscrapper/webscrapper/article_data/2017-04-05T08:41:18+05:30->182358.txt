MANGALURU: The Coast is seeing unsual heat wave conditions in the past few days, which coupled with humidity is taking a toll on more than just human beings.

 The authorities at the Pilikula Biological Park near Moodushedde in the outskirts of the city are leaving nothing to chance. They have installed sprinklers,   and are painting the roofs with lime coat to make the animals cope with the wearing heat. The park has 120 species and 1,070 animals, including birds, mammals and reptiles. Of these 397 animals in 38 species are endangered.
 
 H Jayaprakash Bhandary, director of the park, said: We are making provisions to cool the environs of the zoo so that the temperature is brought down by at least two to three degrees. Apart from sprinklers which are operated three to four times a day inside animal enclosures, large animals like tigers are provided with fans to bring the heat down.
 
 Bears and some monkeys have been lucky as they have been getting   as part of their diet to cool their bodies. Tigers and other carnivores have been getting vitamin supplements. This apart, the zoo authorities have painted the slabs lime coast where animals are housed under concrete structures so the radiation effect is minimised. Some concrete structures are getting coconut leaves thatch.
 
 Bhandary said unlike last year, this year they have plenty of water thanks due to water conservation measures initiated at the park. “We have two bore wells which are yielding plenty of water plus the many small ponds inside the park are full of water,” he added.
 
 The major source of water is the Gurupur river from where water is pumped in case of shortage. The check dam built a few years back has stopped salt water intrusion from the sea thereby helping Pilikula get plenty of water.
