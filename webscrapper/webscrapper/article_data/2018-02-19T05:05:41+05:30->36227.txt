HOUSTON: Indian-American  , who became the first Sikh mayor of New Jersey's Hoboken city, has publicly acknowledged that death threats were made against him and his family recently.

 
 In a statement issued on Friday following a security breach at  , Bhalla said the city is working with the  's Joint Terrorism Task Force to improve security at City Hall. "This incident, along with death threats to me and my family, is an unfortunate reminder that we need to take security seriously," Bhalla said, without elaborating on the threats.
 
 According to city spokesman Juan Melli, a man entered City Hall and told security he needed to use the restroom after going through the metal detectors. While Bhalla was not in his office at the time, his deputy chief of staff, Jason Freeman, observed the man throw a bag with an object in it towards the administrative assistant's desk before running out of the office, Melli said. Bhalla became the first ever Sikh to hold office in New Jersey after a stiff competition that turned ugly when he was labelled a terrorist in slanderous flyers.
