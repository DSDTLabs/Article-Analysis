Be very, very scared. The makers of 'The Final EXIT', which features   in a hatke avatar, says that the film will send shivers down your spine. The trailer of the supernatural horror flick, which was unveiled recently, has also garnered a lot of attention. Addressing the media at the trailer launch, debutant producer   said, “'The Final EXIT' is an Indian film, with the narrative deeply rooted in our country’s philosophy. The movie will give you goosebumps, as you watch horror unwinding in broad daylight, in the heavenly beauty of Ladakh.” 

 Producer   added, “While the film showcases Kunal Roy Kapur in a never-seen-before avatar, actresses like Ananya Sengupta, Scarlet Wilson, Elina Kazan, Archana Veda Sastry and   add to the narrative with their well etched-out characters and oomph quotient. The story will play with the imagination of the audience; it will tantalise, bewitch and captivate them.”
 
 On his part, debutant writer-director   noted, “I have always been a fan of sci-fi movies and horror films. The Final EXIT has the philosophy of our religions and culture as its base. The film also depicts layers of emotions.”
