Panchkula: A special protection officer (SPO) with traffic police has been booked for taking bribe from a resident of Zirakpur, who attached proof with his complaint.  The proof has been verified by the police. The cop was booked on Wednesday under the Prevention of Corruption Act. According to the complainant, Rajesh Kumar Garg, on July 24, 2017 the special protection officer, Jaswinder Singh, asked for a bribe from him and other violators of traffic rules at Sector 4/12 light point.
