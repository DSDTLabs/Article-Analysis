BENGALURU: Four students from a government school are set to represent India in a robotics competition.

 Master Minds, a team of robotics enthusiasts comprising Aravind Reddy, Ramakrishna, Lawrence Aga and A Ramesh had represented India at the Robocup International Competition held at Lepzig, Germany, in 2016. Now, the team has qualified to represent India in the same competition in Nagoya, Japan, from July 27 to 30. The students, aged between 12 and 15 years, learnt the lessons in robotics at a lab set up at   by   for three years. Since the project is complete, they now need funds to participate in the competititon in Japan.
 
 “Parents of these students are either daily wage labourers or domestic workers. About Rs 6 lakh is needed for the compeition. I'm trying to arrange funds to meet the expenses through online crowdfunding,“ said Sridhar P, who teaches Robotics for government schoolchildren. The six-member team won the dance category of the Robocup nationals in February and stood fourth among 39 teams in the   nationals held in Delhi. They also won accolades for the best project research.“They had created a robot which can dance for two minutes on already programmed music. This time, they are focusing on robots playing music and drums,“ added Sridhar.
 
 Last year, six students were scheduled to participate, but three could not get passport on time.
 
 As the mentor is trying to send the student on his own, he is crowd funding through https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/MasterMinds
