PUNE: Chief minister   on Monday said important announcements would be made in the ongoing   session to counter illegal constructions in the state.

 When asked about specific action the state would take to pull down the illegal structures, the chief minister told TOI, “The Assembly session is in the last week and the announcements will be made in the session.“
 
 Fadnavis was in the city on Monday for the   (PMRDA)'s budget meeting. The Bombay high court on Friday refused to give nod to the state's amnesty plan to regularize pre-2015 illegal buildings across the state.
 
 The state would now have to chalk out a plan to counter the issue. Officials of the PMRDA, already taking action against the illegal structures, feel though policies were announced to either pull down or regularize structures, it was an uphill task with no manpower and security backup.
 
 “Recently, there were orders that notices should be issued against even occupied illegal structures and pulled down. We do not have the manpower or the machinery to execute such orders. The state, while making any policy, should understand the ground reality,“ said the official on the condition of anonymity.
 
 Former additional chief secretary   told TOI that the government had made a list of illegal structures in the past and had categorized the ones which could be regularized by paying penalty and others which had to be pulled down. “ Action has to be initiated because allowing illegal structures to exist would send a wrong signal to developers,“ Benjamin said.
 
 The buildings erected flouting rules were thriving on the outskirts and could be dangerous, he added.
