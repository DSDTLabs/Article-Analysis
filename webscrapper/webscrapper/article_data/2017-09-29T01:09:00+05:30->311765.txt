Lucknow: The grandeur of Durga Puja pandals has much to do with the size of   of the goddess as also their embellishment. Decorations at various places in the city vie for the best show every year.

 At the pandal by trans-Gomti Dussehra and Durga Puja Committee in Aliganj, the eco-friendly Murti and its Chal Chitra (backdrop) are decorated with ‘kulo’, a traditional handmade bamboo tray. The 15-foot-wide structure is made of bamboo and hay. Along with golden jewellery for Durga idol, elaborate white and silver ornaments are made of lotus flower stem.
 
 President of the committee D K Chaudhary told TOI, “It took around three months, Rs 75,000 and six people to make the idol. The decoration was supervised by Ranjit Chakravorty, who designs the UP tableau for the Republic Day parade.”
 
 The gorgeous pink and golden Devi idol at the Ravindrapalli pandal looks mesmerising under yellow light. The ornaments for the 15-foot idol have been ordered from West Bengal.
 
 Committee president Utpal Banerjee said, “The ornaments and arms are made of Shola work of Bengal.”
 
 Said to be the most expensive in the city, the Sahara Estate Durga idol is pure white with silver decoration. “The cost of the idol is around Rs 50 lakh. It has been decorated by   artists making murtis for three generations,” said a member.
 
 General secretary of Cantt puja Subir Dutta said of the multi-coloured idol, “We wanted a vibrant and more flamboyant look for the goddess this year.”
