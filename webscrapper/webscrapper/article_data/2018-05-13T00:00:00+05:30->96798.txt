Mothers are our first loves and often thoroughly unappreciated, especially in literature. However some writers and poets invested time to appreciate their mothers through their craft. Here are some of the poems on mothers that truly capture one's love, gratitude and wonder towards their mother.

 
  
 
 
  can go to Bible study every Sunday
 and swear she’s still not convinced,
 but she likes to be around people who are.
 We have the same conversation
 every few years—I’ll ask her if she stops
 to admire the perfect leaves
  of the Japanese maple
  she waters in her backyard,
 or tell her how I can gaze for hours
 at a desert sky and know this
 as divine. Nature, she says,
 doesn’t hold her interest. Not nearly
 as much as the greens, pinks, and grays
 of a Diebenkorn abstract, or the antique
 Tiffany lamp she finds in San Francisco.
 She spends hours with her vegetables,
 tasting the tomatoes she’s picked that morning
 or checking to see which radishes are big enough to pull.
 Lately everything she touches bears fruit,
 from new-green string beans to winning
 golf strokes, glamorous hats she designs and sews,
 soaring stocks with their multiplying shares.
 These are the things she can count in her hands,
 the tangibles to feed and pass on to daughters
 and grandchildren who can’t keep up with all
 the risky numbers she depends on, the blood-sugar counts
 and daily insulin injections, the monthly tests
 of precancerous cells in her liver and lungs.
 She’s a mathematical wonder with so many calculations
 kept alive in her head, adding and subtracting
 when everyone else is asleep.
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  How I loved those spiky suns, 
  rooted stubborn as childhood 
 in the grass, tough as the farmer’s 
 big-headed children—the mats 
 of yellow hair, the bowl-cut fringe. 
 How sturdy they were and how 
 slowly they turned themselves 
 into galaxies, domes of ghost stars 
 barely visible by day, pale 
 cerebrums clinging to life 
 on tough green stems.Like you. 
 Like you, in the end.If you were here, 
 I’d pluck this trembling globe to show 
 how beautiful a thing can be 
 a breath will tear away. 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  Inside my lunch
  to my surprise
  a perfect heart-shaped
  love note lies.
 
  The outside says,
  “Will you be mine?”
  and, “Will you be
  my valentine?”
 
  I take it out
  and wonder who
  would want to tell me
  “I love you.”
 
  Perhaps a girl
 who’s much too shy
 to hand it to me
 eye to eye.
 
  Or maybe it
 was sweetly penned
 in private by
 a secret friend
 
  Who found my lunchbox
 sitting by
 and slid the note in
 on the sly.
 
  Oh, I’d be thrilled
 if it were Jo,
 the cute one in
 the second row.
 
  Or could it be
 from Jennifer?
 Has she found out
 I’m sweet on her?
 
  My mind’s abuzz,
  my shoulders tense.
 I need no more
 of this suspense.
 
  My stomach lurching
  in my throat,
  I open up
  my little note.
 
  Then wham! as if
 it were a bomb,
 inside it reads,
 “I love you—Mom.”
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  Who sat and watched my infant head
  When sleeping on my cradle bed,
  And tears of sweet affection shed?
  My Mother.
  
  When pain and sickness made me cry,
  Who gazed upon my heavy eye,
  And wept for fear that I should die?
  My Mother.
  
  Who taught my infant lips to pray
  And love God’s holy book and day,
  And walk in wisdom’s pleasant way?
  My Mother.
  
  And can I ever cease to be
  Affectionate and kind to thee,
  Who wast so very kind to me,
  My Mother?
  
  Ah, no! the thought I cannot bear,
  And if God please my life to spare
  I hope I shall reward they care,
  My Mother.
  
  When thou art feeble, old and grey,
  My healthy arm shall be thy stay,
  And I will soothe thy pains away,
  My Mother.
