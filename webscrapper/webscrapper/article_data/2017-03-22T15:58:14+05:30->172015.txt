MUMBAI: The transport department is exploring a new technology developed by a group of engineering students that prevents a drunk driver from plying a public transport bus. The system involves installing an ‘alcohol sensor’ in the driver’s cabin that will automatically stop the engine if it detects that the driver is in an inebriated state. 

 “We are looking at the feasibility of introducing the technology in state transport buses and other public transport buses,” state   told mediapersons after inaugurating a day-long workshop on road safety on Tuesday. Stating that   is a serious, unpardonable offence, he added, “The government will take harsh steps to nab and punish drunk drivers.” 
 
 Raote said the department was also considering an insurance scheme for accident victims who suffer a physical handicap and have to struggle for financial support. 
 
  Officials said the objective of Tuesday’s workshop was to sensitize officials from transport department, traffic police, highway police, health department, public works department, MSRDC and   on road safety and reduce number of mishaps by nearly 50% by 2020. 
 
 Joint police commissioner (traffic) Milind Bharambe said: “We are trying to analyze each and every accident and implement measures to prevent such mishaps. We plan to instal speed detection cameras on busy roads to curb the menace of traffic violations.” There are 96 accident-prone spots in Maharashtra of which 44 have been rectified, transport officials said at the event. 
 
 Transport commissioner Praveen Gedam said that they are in talks with the education department to introduce a subject on road safety in schools.
