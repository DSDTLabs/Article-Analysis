NEW DELHI: The   and the   of a cash   had heroically resisted a robbery bid despite being   at outside a Shahbad Dairy ATM on Tuesday. 

 Two days later, a similar incident in Narela didn’t quite have a happy ending. Initial investigation into the two incidents have led police to believe that the cases might be linked as, in both cases, a similar strategy was adopted by the assailants. 
 
 Former colleagues recalled making fun of Rajani Kant Singh — the custodian of the cash van who lost his life in Tuesday’s incident — as they often used to compare him with the famous actor by the same name “who could do the impossible”. When Singh heard of the failed robbery attempt on Tuesday, he was even more pumped up about his job. But little did anyone know that Singh might indeed have to show his strength of character in the next 48 hours.
 
 On Thursday, Singh sensed danger when a group of bikers stopped near their van. Singh and his colleague, Prem, rushed to close the door, but the assailants were quick to react. A policeman, who is part of the investigation, said: “The killers fired so many shots. It was like they were angry and desperate to succeed.” This has led police to believe that the same men might have been involved in the failed attempt two days ago.
