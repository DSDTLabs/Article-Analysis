GUWAHATI:   began their   group-stage match against Bengaluru FC just like the storm that raged on before the game. But like the storm, their performance was also short lived as the visitors took control of the rain-hit game towards the end of the first half and won it 3-1 in the end.

 
 For Aizawl FC, who were playing a home game away from home, Zikhai Dodoz opened the scoring in the fifth minute at Indira Gandhi Stadium here on Thursday. But after that it was Bengaluru FC all the way as Daniel Lucas Segovia, Rahul Bheke and   all scored one goal each.
 
 With this win,   have made it two in two in the group stage. As for Aizawl, they have lost both their matches so far and will take on Abahani Dhaka in their next group-stage match here next Wednesday.
 
 Not much blame can be put on the Santosh Kashyapcoached side, though, as they were clearly outplayed in all areas of the game.
 
 The players did their best but the ISL runners-up were just too good for them. Andrei Ionescu, who scored a brace against Chennayin FC in the Super Cup, was again their star player but he lacked support at times.
 
 As for  , he is doing well as a medium and it remains to be seen how well he can get along with Alfred Jaryan in the upcoming matches.
 
 Bengaluru FC, meanwhile, looked rusty in the beginning and were unable to have a single shot on goal in the first half. After the break, however, they showed why they are considered one of the best teams in the country right now.
