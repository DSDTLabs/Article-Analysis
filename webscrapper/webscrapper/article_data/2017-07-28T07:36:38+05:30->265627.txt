LUCKNOW: In open support of RJD chief  , BSP chief   on Thursday said Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had betrayed the people of his state who voted for anti-BJP grand alliance during the 2015 Bihar assembly elections.

 In a statement, Mayawati said Bihar was another state after Manipur and Goa where BJP had murdered democracy and misused government machinery to form a government. The BSP chief said BJP was trying to divert people’s attention from its failure by trying to project its political rivals as corrupt.
 
 The BSP chief said it was not just about political leaders but also those who vote for one political party or the other in the elections. “The trend set by BJP is dangerous for a democratic set-up,” said Mayawati.
 
 Statement of the former UP chief minister comes close after Lalu offered her a   seat from Bihar. Mayawati had recently resigned from RS in protest against not being allowed to speak on the issue of Dalit atrocities in Saharanpur. Lalu has been pushing for unity between BSP and its arch rival   to take on the BJP. The RJD chief even invited Mayawati and and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for a joint rally in Patna on August 27.
