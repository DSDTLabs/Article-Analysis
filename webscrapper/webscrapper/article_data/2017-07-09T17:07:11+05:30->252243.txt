Everyone knows the gleaming apples you buy from everywhere but a farm are coated with wax to make it look more appealing. 

 Actor   recently got a direct taste of the wax in the apples and instead of just washing the apple and eating it like the rest of us, posted a video of it on facebook. "This is what I found today in my Apple that I got from a shop near my shooting spot ... least I can do is post it on my page ...what else can I do?" he posted. In the video, one can see the wax just coming off as someone scrapes away at it with a knife. Someone even commented, ''you can use it instead of candles''.
 
 Kalidas is currently awaiting the release of his debut movie, Abrid Shine's Poomaram. Meanwhile,   and Parvathy seem to be on a second honeymoon, with the couple posting lovey dovey pictures from a vacation, apparently in a cold country.
