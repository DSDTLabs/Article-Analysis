Bollywood actor   has been booked by the Shimla police on charges of “outraging modesty” on his cousin’s complaint of sexual assault.

 The actor’s cousin had in February filed an online complaint and alleged that he had sexually assaulted her 47 years ago in January 1971 at a Shimla hotel.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 The complainant later provided the cops with a written complaint to support her claim. The online complaint was forwarded to Shimla SP for action and now a case under Section 354 of the India Penal Code has been registered against Jeetendra, Himachal Pradesh DGP S R Mardi said.
 
 Shimla SP   said an FIR under Section 354 has been registered against Jeetendra. The complainant will now record her statement before a magistrate and based on her statement further action would be initiated in the case. The cops have been in constant touch with the complainant and are gathering information from her via video-conferencing. Any decision on questioning Jeetendra or summoning him in the case would be taken after the woman’s statement is recorded in the presence of a magistrate, sources said.
 
 The cops have also asked her to provide evidence to support her claim that she had stayed in a Shimla hotel with Jeetendra in 1971. The actor’s lawyer had earlier dismissed the allegations and questioned the timing of the “baseless complaint”. “It seems to be nothing but a miserable effort by a jealous competitor to disrupt business activities of my client,” the lawyer had said.
