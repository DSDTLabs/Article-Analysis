BHOPAL: Intermittent showers accompanied by hailstorm across the state from Morena to Mandsaur have threatened the standing crops and the produce lying in the fields after harvesting.

 Mustard in Chambal region and opium in Malwa are the main crops likely to be damaged, said farmers. It rained heavily at many places in Bhind, Morena and Sheopur districts during the last three days. Farmers of the area expecting bumper yield are now a concerned lot. Bheron Singh, a farmer in Morena’s Jaura village, said, “I had harvested the crop and the produce was lying in the fields. After rainfall and hail, the dry mustard beans were damaged extensively. At some places the mustard seeds have come out before time, affecting its quality.”
 
 Similarly, in Mandsaur, Neemuch and Ratlam region, the opium crop has been affected at many places. At some places the process of extracting latex from the opium fruit is over, but at other places the process is on and the farmers have borne the brunt of the weather conditions, said Ram Singh Chouhan, a farmer.
 
 “The latex gets diluted, affecting the quality of opium,” he said, adding there is no mechanism to calculate the damage caused to the crop. A cooperative and   leader, Chouhan said the crop should be included in the category of masala (spices) and covered under the PM crop insurance scheme.
 
 Agriculture minister Gaurishankar Bisen said, “Though it has not rained much, we are waiting for the field reports to understand the impact of the rainfall.” Crop has also been affected in the districts of Bundelkhand following a spell of rainfall. Changing weather pattern has become a regular feature now, said Fazal Mehmood, a farmer in Chhatarpur. “Every time our crops are damaged we have no other option but to look at the government for help,” he added.
