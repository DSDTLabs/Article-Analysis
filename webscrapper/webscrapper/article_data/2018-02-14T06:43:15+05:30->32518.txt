AHMEDABAD: The   in urban areas including all   and   was last taken up in 2011, since when the forest and the civic authorities have failed to take up the tree count.

 Officials in the forest department said that the tree count in the urban areas was to be taken up in 2015, but the civic authorities have not shown any interest in the taking up the count. The authorities said that urban bodies fear that there may be a drastic fall from the count taken up in 2010.
 
 Officials said that in 2017 it was decided to have urban tree count. Instead of solely relying on a tree-marking census, also called a field count, the forest authorities had decided that the urban tree count would also use satellite imaging and GPS.
 
 Tree surveys in rural areas, outside the forests in Gujarat, were done in 2003 and 2009, but the first tree counting in areas under municipal corporations and nagarpalikas was done in 2011 by the social forestry wing of the state forest department, with help from local organizations.
 
 The officials said that it was due in 2016, but there were no effort by the civic authorities and urban department to conduct such a survey again.
 
 The officials said that in the 2011 count, Ahmedabad city had 6,18,048 trees which was nearly 5% of the total geographical area of Ahmedabad city. Forest officials said that with the Metro and other road widening work going on, civic officials fear that the count will go down drastically.
