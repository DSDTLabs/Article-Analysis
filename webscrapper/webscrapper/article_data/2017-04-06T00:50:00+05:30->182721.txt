NAVI MUMBAI: The construction of the first-ever   to be owned by the   body will be completed by end of June in Savali village, Ghansoli said sources. The pool is being constructed in the 41,000 sq m theme-based Central park.

 “The pool, constructed at a budget of Rs 1.9 crore, will be ready in two months. It is one of the attractions in the park,” said   city engineer  .
 
 The construction of the pool was started after residents and even corporators expressed surprise over the city not having its own swimming pool. “Although there are a couple of privately-owned swimming pools, it is indeed surprising that the facility was not available for residents,” said a member of sports committee and elected representative, Vishal Dolas.
 
 Earlier attempts by the administration to build a swimming pool on a plot in sector 12, Vashi allotted by Cidco specifically for the purpose failed to materialize as it was encroached by an illegal Shiv Sena office. 
 
 “A tender was floated in 2015 for construction of the pool on the 4,049 sq m plot but the proposal had to be shelved due to the party office. Notices have been issued to the party office and we have even sought police protection to ensure the plot is vacated,” said additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan. He added that if things go as planned, then the administration will get one more swimming pool
