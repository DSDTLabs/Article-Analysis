Mayapur: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has promised all help to ISKCON over its plan to set up a world tourism circuit centre in Nadia’s Mayapur. ISKCON authorities sought the CM’s assistance in this regard on Monday when she paid a visit to Mayapur temple on her way to Krishnagar.

  The CM seized the opportunity to request Alfred Brush   — the great grandson of Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company and a Hare Krishna devotee — to set up an automobile facility in Bengal like the company has done in Chennai and in Gujarat’s Sanand. Ford told the CM he would look into the proposal. The US auto major is setting up a Global Technology and Business Centre on a 28-acre land in TN’s Shollinganallur with an investment of Rs 1300 crore. Mamata also visited Chaitanya Math and Chand Kazi Mazar.
