Thiruvananthapuram: A survey by the corporationâ€™s health wing has found that around 590 truckloads of waste need to be removed from   to clean it. The survey report pointed out that it would require heavy machines for clearing the waste. 

 The survey found as many as 276 violations of waste disposal rules by households located on the banks of the river, mostly dumping liquid and other kinds of waste to Killiyaar. The officials have served notices to 235 house owners and 174 violations have been addressed. The officials have identified 39 drains measuring 42.5 km leading to Killiyaar. One major challenge would be cleaning of these drains as a major portion of drains identified during the survey are covered. The drain at Valiyasala is covered up to 90% while those at Chalai, Attukal, Arannur, Jagathy and Pangode are also covered for a long distance.
 
 The officials said that the priority will be clearing areas of vast deposits of garbage and dirt. The corporation must find an ideal landfill site. The survey has also identified encroachments into the canal, however, the health wing will mainly concentrate on clearing the waste and cleaning of drains which are found to be dumping liquid waste into Killiyaar.
 
 Mayor V K Prasanth has directed the officials to chart out an action plan for systematic removal of waste and cleaning of drains. The civic body will have to avail the use of machines for the purpose, and it is said that a mission modelled on Operation Anantha would have to be executed. This should be done in coordination with various departments.
 
 The corporation has launched a project to clean all major water bodies. Surveys of Karamana river, Akkulam Lake and Parvathy Puthanar have already been completed.
