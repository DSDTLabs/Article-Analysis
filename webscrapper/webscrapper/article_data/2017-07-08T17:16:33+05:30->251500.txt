While Team India celebrated the birthday of former captain   on July 7, 2017, music director   seemed to be in a celebratory mood too. 

 MS Dhoni rung in his birthday by cutting a cake with his teammates and wife, a moment which his teammate Hardik Pandya recorded a video of and shared on social media. Fans across the world sent in birthday wishes to the cricketer, but it is music director SS Thaman’s tweet that caught our attention. 
 
 It is a well-known fact that SS Thaman is a massive fan of MS Dhoni, he had earlier even announced plans of composing a tribute for the cricketer. So, it is only fitting that he would dedicate his 10,000th tweet to the star cricketer. Thaman took to Twitter at midnight and wrote – ‘This is my 10000'th tweet & I dedicate this to india's greatest captain @msdhoni I waited 6 days without tweeting fr make this one’
