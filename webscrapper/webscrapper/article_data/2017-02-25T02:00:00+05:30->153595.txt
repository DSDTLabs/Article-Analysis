PATNA: The two-day annual college festival of National Institute of Fashion Technology-Patna, Spectrum 2017, began on Friday with the students participating in different activities like flash mob, dance, street play, video making, English and Hindi debate competition, face painting, paper modelling and mannequin makeover contest on the inaugural day.

 Over 400 students of NIFT-Patna, IIT-Patna, IGIMS, AIIMS-Patna, CIMAGE, BIT-Patna, CNLU, J D Women’s College, Patna Women’s College, Amity and PMCH took part in the festival. “The annual festival is aimed at developing team spirit among the students. This year’s theme is ‘parikalpana (hypothesis)’,” said Sanjay Shrivastava, director of NIFT-Patna.
 
 “Padma Shri Bharti Bandhu, a Sufi singer, will make this year’s college festival a memorable one for the students. Mumbai’s famous band Bombay Bairag will also perform,” Shrivastava added.
 
 Kunjika Sagar, convenor of cultural activities in the college, said the students displayed their hidden talent on the inaugural day of the festival. “They also made graffiti in the administrative block which chronicles the life of a student,” she added.
 
 Divya Bharati, Shakil-ur-Rehman, Anamika Sinha and Smita Rani made a miniature model of NIFT campus which was presented in the paper modelling competition. “It took us three days to prepare the model. Students of accessories design know the art of making 3D models of structures,” said Divya Bharti, a second year student of the college, adding such group activities lead to exchange of ideas.
 
 “The college fest is a well-deserved break for us. We don’t have any classes for two days,” said Shreya Mehrotra, a second year student of the college, who participated in badminton, gully cricket and volleyball competitions on Friday.
