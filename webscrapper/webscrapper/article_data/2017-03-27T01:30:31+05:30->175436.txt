NEW DELHI: A three-year-old girl died after drowning in an open reservoir dug in front of her neighbour’s house in Tigri village near Sangam Vihar in south Delhi on Sunday afternoon. The body was fished out of the   by the neighbour while her parents were looking for the child in the locality. The neighbour is being questioned.

 Around 1pm, Aalifa went playing outside her house at C-block. Preliminary inquiries suggest that the child entered the neighbour’s house without anyone noticing it and fell into the tank that was kept open for cleaning. The police have not ruled out the possibility of a foul play.
 
 The child’s parents recently sent her to Tigri to stay with her grandmother as the mother delivered a son 20 days ago and has been living with her parents. The girl’s father, Asif, runs an autorickshaw in Madhopur in east Delhi. 
 
 Around 2pm, the police received a call from the girl’s father and after registering a missing complaint, sent a team to look for her. Within a few minutes, some neighbours informed the parents about the body floating in the tank. 
 
 The police suspect that the girl might have fallen into the pit around 1pm and might have tried calling for help as well but nobody heard her. She also had injuries on her limbs, perhaps caused by the fall, cops added.
 
 The girl was taken to Batra Hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. “A case under IPC 304A (causing death by negligence) has been registered based on the statement of the parents and a probe has been initiated into how the child had fallen into the pit,” said Romil Baaniya, deputy commissioner of police, southeast.
