MUMBAI: A 30-year-old woman pressed charges of   against a man after her husband found them in   at his Malad (E) residence last week. Police recorded statements of neighbours, who said the accused used to visit the house frequently and he was her  . The accused is at large. 

 The homemaker lives with her husband, a snack vendor, her two sons, brother, mother, father-in-law and sister-in-law in a rented house at Daftary Road.
 
 The woman’s husband had gone out at night when he realised that he had left something at home. He returned to collect it when he spotted a stranger in the bedroom. When she started to shout for help, her husband caught the man and thrashed him. But the man quickly collected his clothes from the room and fled.
 
 The woman told police in her complaint that her mother and father-in-law were asleep on another floor and she had left the door open for her husband when the stranger barged in. Her brother and sister-in-law had gone to Uttar Pradesh. “Based on the woman's statement, we registered a case of rape under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code,” a senior officer said.
