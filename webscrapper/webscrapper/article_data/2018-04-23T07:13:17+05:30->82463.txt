HYDERABAD: Farmers pilfering   water to irrigate fields due to depleted groundwater has landed government officials in a spot. “Borewells have dried up. Groundwater levels have dipped drastically. The 24x7 power supply is also causing borewells to dry up and farmers are indiscriminately  ,” an official involved in implementation of Mission Bhagiratha project said.

 The issue was brought to the notice of chief minister   during the collectors’ conference on Saturday. The chief minister instructed collectors to ensure that farmers are booked by police for tapping and damaging Bhagiratha  .
 
 Officials said mandal revenue officers or tehsildars along with the contractor agency and rural water supply officials will inspect pipelines at least twice a week and book the guilty.
 
 “It’s not about diversion of drinking water for irrigation, damage to pipelines is the bigger issue. These are secondary pipelines passing from one village to another and have air valves every 500m and cleaning valves at every 3-4km. These are also being damaged. This is not against farmers, but to protect the pipelines,” an official said.
