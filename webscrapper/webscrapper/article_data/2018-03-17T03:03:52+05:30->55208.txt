NEW DELHI: The   on Friday reserved its order on a plea seeking a court-monitored independent probe into allegedly suspicious death of special judge  , who was holding trial in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, even as the Maharashtra government contended that the petitions are motivated and aimed at targeting “one individual.”

 
 Senior advocate Mukul  , appearing for the state government, told a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilar and D Y   there was nothing suspicious in the case as “Loya died in the lap of his colleague judges” and said the petitioners seeking independent probe had misquoted the opinion of doctors to bolster their demand.
 
 He said the   has power to order an independent probe but it should not be done in a routine case and if such an order is passed, judges, who had accompanied Loya on the day of his death, will have to stand in the witness box. “Their so called aim to protect judiciary is false.They are using the unfortunate death of judge Loya as a facade to target the gentleman,” he said.
 
 Rohatgi said the CJI should uphold rule of law and ensure judges function without fear and favour.
 
 The petitioners contended there were suspicious circumstances surrounding Loya’s death and the court should not consider them coincidences. They said Loya was not given proper and timely medical attention and the state’s probe was not adequate.
