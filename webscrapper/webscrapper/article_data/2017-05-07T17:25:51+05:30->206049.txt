 Agriculture expert RS Tiwari says, “Farmers are currently cultivating seeds being brought from Tiawan to yield a good crop in limited resources." He further added “the small sized watermelon and melon in round and square shapes are more in demand as they have a total solid sugar (TSS) value up to 14 to 15 percent".

 These watermelon are named Vishal, Anmol, and Saraswati which have different colours from inside and outside. 
 
 Deputy Director (Horticulture) PK Shukla says “through silver mulching, which is largely adopted by farmers in UP, MP, Maharastra, Punjab and others states, crops of seasonal fruits could be cultivated in lesser amount of water. Crops of watermelon and melon are also being cultivated through the same technique in the region".
