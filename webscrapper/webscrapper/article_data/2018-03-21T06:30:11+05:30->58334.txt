NEW DELHI: Not all attempts to rescue Indian hostages abroad have ended on a sad note, unlike what happened with the 39 Indian labourers.

 Two high-profile cases, both in Iraq, were the release and repatriation of Indian truckers in 2004 and that of 46 Kerala nurses around the same time the 39 Indian workers were abducted.
 
 The nurses were kidnapped from a hospital in the Iraqi city of Tikrit. While foreign minister   contacted foreign ministers of almost every Gulf country to secure their release, a few Kerala businessmen are also said to have played a key role in convincing IS to free them.
 
 Similarly, three Indian truckers were abducted by anti-US fighters while on their way to Iraq from   in 2004. The then   government managed to get them released after protracted negotiations headed by then junior foreign minister E Ahameds. It helped that the kidnappers were not anti-India.
 
 In another high-profile case, Father Tom Uzhunnalil of Kerala was released from Yemen with help from Oman in September 2017. Oman helped India secure his release after a request from the Vatican.
 
 In July 2016, Judith Dâ€™Souza, an Indian NGO worker who was abducted from   in  , was rescued.
