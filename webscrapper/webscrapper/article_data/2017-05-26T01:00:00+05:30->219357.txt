Singer-composer   has always been interested in promoting greener energy alternatives. Now, he is getting a   system in place at his Bandra home. 

 Arjun says, “It’s my pet project. I’ve always been concerned about   issues. Earlier, most of the green energy alternatives were not affordable. But now, solar technology has become economically viable and semi-practical. I would love to have a house with an off-the-grid solar system, but I don’t have enough open surface area that’s exposed to the sun. As per the current plans, my solar power system will be able to generate two to four KW of energy, which is still not bad. So, I’ll alternate between conventional electricity and solar-powered electricity at my home. 
 
 The artiste has given up red meat and milk, carpools or walks to reach his destination and also disposes waste intelligently. He has planted over 800 trees in his farm in the outskirts of Mumbai. “A lot of what we eat comes from our farm,” he smiles, adding, "My mother is an agriculturalist (along with being a lawyer and an international medal winner in shooting). So I've had good training!” .
 
 Arjun hopes to create more awareness about global warming issues. He says, “It’s a problem that will affect our immediate future and making simple changes to our lifestyle can help. We need to find simpler solutions to make it easier for people to be environment-friendly.”
