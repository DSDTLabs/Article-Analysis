KANPUR: The alleged suicide by a 40-year-old city   Anup Singh on the intervening night of March 6-7 has taken a new turn. He had reportedly consumed some   substance at his house in   area of the city.

 The case was treated as a simple case of suicide until a video suicide note, which he had allegedly shot on the night of March 6, went viral on social media on Saturday in which he had accused six people, including his wife for forcing him to take the extreme step. “We will examine the video suicide note, send it to the forensic lab and then proceed further and register a case of abetment to suicide under section 306 of IPC,” said SHO Chakeri, PK Shukla.
