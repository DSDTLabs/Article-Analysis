PATNA: Former minister and senior HAM (S) functionary   on Wednesday criticised the state government for poor education system and alleged that most government schools and colleges are running without teachers. 

 “There is not a single government school and college with fully-functional practical laboratories. Students who had never been to laboratories and don’t even know about science practical, get maximum marks in exams. Such things can happen in Bihar only,” the former MLC said at a press conference.
 
 “I have visited a number of government schools in   region of   district. I saw the libraries and laboratories out of order and locked. Books are rotting in libraries and equipment are getting rusted in labs. How will government schoolchildren, who normally belong to underprivileged sections of the society, get access to knowledge without teachers?” Singh alleged and added that the state government should constitute a selection committee to recruit teachers in government schools and colleges.
 
 Targeting CM Nitish for making fake promises on improvement of quality of education, Singh claimed the state government had done nothing in the last 14 years, except topper scams and money laundering in the name of development.
 
 State education minister  , on the other hand, told this newspaper that the government would soon recruit guest teachers in secondary and senior secondary schools.
 
 “As far as the low teacher student ratio is concerned, the Patna high court has barred the government from recruiting teachers in government schools. Hence, we are going to hire guest teachers in English, science and mathematics subjects. The state government has even sanctioned Rs3 lakh for laboratories in each high school and Rs5 lakh for each senior secondary school,” said Verma.
