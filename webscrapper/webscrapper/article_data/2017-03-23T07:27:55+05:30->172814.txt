 The man asked Basha, a Pallavaram resident, to give Rs 4 lakh as advance and said he would take the rest later.
 
 Basha had only Rs 2 lakh and asked his friends Abdul Basha and Farooq to help him with Rs 2 lakh. As soon as they brought the cash, the man gave Basha the bag containing the `foreign currency' and left, saying he would had to give a ride home to a disabled friend and return to collect the remaining money.
