MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday served a notice to the occupiers of   at Colaba Causeway after officials found that   were being placed at the   level of the eatery without its permission.

 
 Assistant municipal commissioner of A ward Kiran Dighavkar confirmed that Leopold had not taken any permission for repairs, hence, it will have to “take action”. 
 
 The notice, issued under Section 354(A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, stated: “If you are in possession of any permission approved by the competent authority in favour of the erection of the building or execution of the work...produce it within 24 hours...” TOI has a copy of the notice. Civic officials said if the eatery does not produce the permission within a day or fails to stop the work, the canopy would be pulled down.
 
 A notice is issued under Section 354(A) of the MMC Act when the BMC is convinced that a building is being erected or repairs are being unlawfully carried on a premises. In such cases, a stop-work notice is issued. When TOI visited the spot on Tuesday, repair work was on in full swing and the footpath blocked for pedestrians. 
 
 A spokesperson for Leopold Cafe said, “Our establishment is not carrying out any illegal repair... the iron beams on the front façade are so corroded that they pose real danger. One portion even collapsed after it was propped up. The BMC sent us a notice saying we should carry out the repair ourselves, else we would be responsible if any mishap occurred on the premises. We...are getting basic safety measures fixed.”
