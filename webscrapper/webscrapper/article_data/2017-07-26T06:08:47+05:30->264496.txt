MUMBAI: A week after a   was found with Rs 65 lakh on him, investigating agencies are probing whether he was promised   in exchange for cash. 

 Vikas Rasal, additional registrar of cooperation societies, was returning from New Delhi on the night of July 6 when he was intercepted by income-tax officials in the airport. He was found to be carrying Rs 65 lakh in undeclared cash. Rasal had been to the capital for an interview for promotion to the IAS cadre from the non-revenue cadre. 
 
 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis told TOI that multiple agencies are probing into all aspects of the cash found on Rasal, who was CEO of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Iron and Steel Market Committee. “Besides I-T and the  , other investigating agencies too are probing him,’’ said Fadnavis. 
 
 After screening at the state level by a committee headed by chief secretary  , a list of 10 officials was submitted to the   for induction into the IAS. UPSC selected two; Rasal’s nomination was rejected. I-T sources said they believe the money was to be paid as bribe. 
 
 “Rasal has not admitted to it. We have written to the ACB about our findings,” an official said. I-T is also probing Rasal’s properties and unaccounted for wealth after collecting documents. “Once the ACB inquiry is complete, it will be decided if a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act can be registered against him,’’ a senior official said. The ACB is also probing if the cash was meant to be handed over to someone in lieu of his nomination for the IAS and whether he has parked more cash elsewhere.
