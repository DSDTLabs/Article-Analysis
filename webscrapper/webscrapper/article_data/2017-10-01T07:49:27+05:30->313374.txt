BENGALURU: Fr  , 59, the Catholic priest who was recently released after an 18-month abduction in  , said on Saturday he had absolutely no idea who his abductors were, but added they took good care of him.

 "I was shifted four times in the course of my abduction but was not harmed even once.They ensured that I got my medication (for diabetes) and even procured insulin once. During Ramzan, they took care that I was not left to fast,"   said here on Saturday.
 
 A visibly weak Tom, who is yet to fully recuperate, said his days in custody enhanced his belief in god, and it was due to his blessings that he returned unharmed. "I do not belong just to my family or the Salesian congregation anymore. I belong to the entire world that prayed for my safety. I have been informed by my relatives (in  ) that even our Hindu and Muslim brothers and sisters offered prayers for me. This shows that it was god's blessings that kept me safe and that there is some good in every person, which is why my abductors took such good care," he said.
 
 He said he never had a conversation with any of his abductors and that his only communication with them was to seek things he needed. "I did not understand Arabic and they didn't seem to know English. The only words were exchanged between us when I had to use the toilet or when I needed something," he said. Tom was abducted on March 4, 2016 from outside the chapel he was praying at in Yemen, and was released on September 12, 2017. While it is believed he was abducted by the Islamic State, Tom is in no position to confirm that.
 
 He has not met personnel from any of India's security agencies dealing with terror as yet. He only returned to India on September 28 as he was taken to   soon after his release, and is planning to visit his family in Kerala next week.
