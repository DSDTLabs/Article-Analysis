AMARAVATI: Chief minister   will meet Prime Minister   in New Delhi on January 12. The schedule of the visit was finalised here on Saturday. 

 Naidu, who is now busy participating in the Janmabhoomi programme covering one district every day, will hold a review meeting with the officials on Jan 11 after conclusion of the programme on Jan 10. On Jan 12, the chief minister would go to the national capital with the data of the central funds promised and released under various heads.
 
 The focus is likely to be on funds to be released for the Polavaram project, besides those promised under the special package announced instead of the Special Category Status (SCS). The CM is not happy with the central assistance. He even threatened to hand over the Polavaram project to the Centre if the release of funds continued to be slow. He also expressed his displeasure over being cold-shouldered by the Centre in release of funds under the special package.
 
 As   plans to make Polavaram and   his poll plank, he is keen on at least completing construction of the cofferdam as it would help Naidu to release water to the Krishna delta by gravity, as promised by him earlier. Now that the central government has cleared the hurdles for construction of the cofferdam, the CM is likely to renew his demand for release of more funds to speed up the work. The 135-ft high cofferdam would facilitate construction of the earth-cum-rock-fill dam and the diaphragm wall for the project by blocking the flow of water.
 
 This time around, the CM is likely to make a fresh presentation on the project to the prime minister as the central government's financial commitment is required to meet the targets. The BJP-led   at the Centre and the TDP-BJP government in the state have promised to complete the project and release water to Krishna delta by 2018. If this deadline is met, the Centre has to be liberal in releasing funds for the national project in accordance with the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.
