Ghaziabad: The blocked sewer lines in Ahimsa Khand-2 in Indirapuram are giving a tough time to the residents of various societies. They often have to bribe the GDA officials to get them repaired. The GDA, meanwhile, denied the allegations.

 The maintenance managers of several housing societies claimed that due to blocked sewer lines, the waste water often flows back into the society, thus flooding the basement and the underground parking area. The process also damages the building structure, they said.
 
 Alok Kumar, a resident of Arihant Harmony and the founder of Federation of Association Of Apartment Owners told TOI that the AOAs of the societies have to pay the employees of GDA to get quick relief from the sewage mess piling up inside their society. “It is open corruption taking undue advantage of the helplessness of residents,” he said. 
 
 Alok further said that all the societies in the area face such problems and silently pay up to get it solved. 
 
 “The only long term solution to the problem is the replacement of the sewer lines with larger pipes with more capacity. We filed a PIL in Allahabad high court in February 2016, after which the court had passed an order directing GDA to sort out the issue. Following the court's order, residents formed a six-member committee to assist GDA in the process. A year after the court's order, choked sewer lines are still a major problem for societies,” added Kumar.
 
 A maintenance manager of another residential society in the area said that the operators who come for the service insist that sewer lines outside the society are also privately owned and belong to the society which is why the AOAs have to pay for them as its not their job.
 
 When contacted, Vijay Kumar Yadav, vice-chairman of GDA said that it was the first time he was hearing of such allegations. Yadav assured that he would look into the issue and get it sorted out.
