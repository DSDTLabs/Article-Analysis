CHANDIGARH: The   government is considering introducing a new ticketing system in   buses where no physical ticket would be provided to commuters but a code would be generated to act as one. The ‘no ticket-less cash’ fare box methodology would be introduced in   Bus Service from this year, it is being planned. It would be an entirely mobile-based ticketing system under which no physical ticket would be provided to passengers, and a code would be generated which would act as ticket, he said.
