PUNE:   (RSS) chief   said here on Sunday that " " is a mere political slogan and not a part of the RSS' approach towards an inclusive nation building. 

 "The language of 'mukt' (free) is used in politics. RSS does not use such language," Bhagwat said at a book launch function. "We believe in uniting everyone. In the process of nation building, we will have to unite each and every one, including our oppositions," Bhagwat added. 
 
 Bhagwat's statement assumes significance in the wake of the   (BJP) leadership's oft-repeated talk about "Congress Mukt Bharat". BJP has, in fact, accused the grand old party of eulogizing the Gandhi family when in power, at the cost of the country's development.
 
 Bhagwat said, "Instead of speaking about 'Congress Mukt' or 'RSS Mukt Bharat', we should look at uniting everyone for the country's development." He stressed the need for a positive approach to bring about change. "Those with a negative approach would think only of conflicts and divisions. Such a person is not useful in the process of nation-building," he said.
 
 On Hindutva, the RSS chief said, "One of the ways of looking at Hindutva was having faith in oneself, one's family and the country. One has to have faith in himself that he will be able to contribute to nation building. Similarly, he also should have faith in his family, his village and the country as a whole and then only we can have inclusive process of nation building."
 
 Earlier, Bhagwat released six books written by Dnyaneshwar Mulay, a 1983-batch Indian Foreign Service officer, who is currently secretary (consular, passport, visa and overseas Indian affairs) in the ministry of external affairs.
 
 The RSS chief praised Mulay for his efforts to reach out to the common man through his work and said the country needed officers like him who were connected with their motherland.
