Pune:   has set up its Pune chapter to create a better funding eco-system for startups in the city.

 Pune is home to several startups, but lacks a funding ecosystem, often sending them scouting for funds to Mumbai, Bangalore and other cities.
 
 Mumbai Angels Network said, it has over 250 members across three active chapters, including Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, and their portfolio comprises over 90 ventures across multiple sectors “focused primarily on seed and early stage companies".
 
 The average ticket size of each investment is around Rs 2.5-Rs 3 crore.
 
 The company started setting up its Pune chapter in October 2016. “The   ecosystem in Pune will grow only when investors from Pune invest. We are trying to say that angel investing is also an asset class,” said Chandni Jafri, CEO, Mumbai Angels Network.
 
 Jaffri said after the company is evaluated, it takes about 2-4 weeks for the startups to get funding and angel investors typically take up to 20% of the shares in the startups for their investment.
