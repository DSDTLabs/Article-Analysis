HYDERABAD: As removal of encroachments on nalas (storm water drains) has become a herculean task,   ( ) has decided to focus only on bottle-necks, to ensure free flow of water in the nalas. 

 The civic body last year identified 12,153 properties that need to be removed for widening nalas, to prevent inundation due to rains. The state government also asked GHMC to take up removal of structures abutting the nalas. Bulldozing all structures is not possible as it would lead to commotion among locals. Rehabilitation will be a major problem as well. So instead, critical points have been identified on 46 nalas, which were given priority.
 
 "GHMC was able to remove 938 structures in 2016, 122 properties in 2017, and 163 properties in the past two months, along 17 nalas, in the city," GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy said.
 
 The properties taken over in the past few days are along   to Musi, tunneling of pipe drain to Nawab Saheb Kunta, Deepthisrinagar chervu to Gangaram chervu, and   to Yellamma Kunta. 
 
 Officials said that to convince affected property owners about the need to widen the nalas and water bodies, GHMC has given owners '200% Transferrable Developmen Rights' (TDR) free of cost, where the owners can construct or sell their development rights to others. In case of properties affected partially, the municipal corporation will construct an RCC slab on nala portion.
 
 GHMC authorities said those who lost their livelihood, when giving up properties, are eligible for two BHK houses which are under construction. For instance, residents of Safdar Nagar slum, which was completely taken over, would be rehabilitated in two BHK housing scheme.
 
 "All the major bottle necks would be cleared before the monsoon season begins, which is around May this year," a superintending engineer said
