THANE: Big-time bookie Sonu Jalan (41) has reportedly spilled the beans on associates across the UAE, Pakistan and   in a nexus with underworld fugitive gangster  , where the gambling cartel accepted bets and scripted matches for hefty payouts. 

 Jalan reportedly opened up on a Bollywood biggie who was allegedly blackmailed, by threatening to expose his gambling interests.
 
 Picked up from the Kalyan sessions court by the anti-extortion cell of Thane police, Jalan is said to be a prize catch as he is a key member of the international gambling circuit.
 
 "Investigations are on about Jalan's association and regular communication with the   betting circuit in Dubai with   and Raees Faruki, as they are known to be operation heads of gambling in Dubai operated by the gangster," said senior inspector Pradeep Sharma.
 
 Jalan has met the duo in Dubai, where they operate from a corporate office with staff who look after the betting business operated from India and across the globe, Sharma added.
