Nagpur: The proposal of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to demolish the   in front of the railway   has faced strong opposition from the Aam Aadmi party.Members of the party staged a rally on Thursday from the DRM office (Jaistambh Square) to Manas Square to oppose the NMC’s proposal. 

 AAP’s Vidarbha secretary, Jagjit Singh said that the civic body conducted the detailed survey of the flyover before its construction and the structure is very much required for smooth vehicular movement towards Jaistambh Square. “It is notable that the width of the flyover is 9 metre whereas the width of the road below is between six metre and twelve metre But if the flyover is demolished than instead of the nine metres, the road will be extended upto only 5 metres”, he added.
 
 The protestors also spoke on the other factots involved in the demolition of the flyover. They alleged that it was constructed by the civic body along with public participation and using the hard earned money of taxpayers which should be saved. The members aso said how the flyover will generate employment issues for several shopkeepers nearby. 
 
 The party members said that instead of pulling down the flyover, the civic body should make the road wider to provide more space for the traffic movement. The extra space can be created by shifting the bus station for travelers of Madhya Pradesh, MSRTC office, and a school from the present location. The passengers can use the road to go to   station while the flyover can be used to approach Jaistambh Square.
 
  also urged to take strict action against those who illegally park their vehicle and demanded to remove encroachment from the road as this will be in favour of the devotees going to Ganesh Tekdi. Devendra Wankhede, Jagjit Singh, Prabhat Agarwal, Kavita Singhal were a few of the and others were part of the rally.
