VADODARA: Four candidates are now in fray for the two seats of donor’s category polls of M S University’s senate body with three candidates withdrawing from the poll fray on the last day of withdrawal. 

 On Tuesday, professor Pragnesh Shah, Rahul Sandhu and   withdrew their candidatures leaving four candidates – Prataprao Bhoite, Vrajesh Patel, Mayank Patel and Jigar Inamdar in the polls. 
 
 Bhoite and Vrajesh are contesting the poll battle as candidates backed by the ‘sankalan samiti’. 
 
 On Tuesday, the row over mention of dead persons in the voters list continued as members of the ‘sankalan samiti’ met university officials objecting to the goof-up in the electoral rolls. 
 
 The members have submitted objections stating that names of two persons who have expired have been mentioned in the electoral rolls. “These names were mentioned even when the university had prepared the electoral roll in 2011 – the last election of senate. But the university has failed to delete the names,” said Bhoite. 
 
 MSU’s deputy registrar   however said that those individual donors who have expired will be automatically deemed to be cancelled. 
 
 “Unlike the case of donations made by trusts, institutions and/ or corporate bodies, the names of individual donors are continued in the electoral list. As per existing rules, we can delete the names only if somebody produces any evidence regarding the demise,” said Soni, adding that in any case the university has made photo identity proofs compulsory for the polls. 
 
 Elections for the two seats are scheduled on February 9. There are nearly 130 voters mentioned in the electoral rolls issued by the university.
