MEERUT: After a Supreme Court ruling, the   will now be required to revise the electoral rolls and remove illegal occupants such as encroachers, slum dwellers, etc.
 
  The MCB has already shortlisted 4,700 such occupants which, according to sources, the number could reach 10,000.
  
  Hearing a case regarding the Pachmarhi Cantonment Board’s election, the apex court had in September last stated that people living in encroachments were not entitled to be included in the voter’s list.
  
  The director general of   in Delhi decided that the ruling would now be applied to all 62 cantonments in the country, and issued a directive to that effect.
  
  “Yes, we have received this directive. We will study the matter and start the process. It is very clear that the process must be completed soon. We have begun and have already shortlisted some illegal occupants. The task is quite huge as there are eight wards and each list will have to be checked and made again. We will complete the process soon after the elections,” said M A Zafar, Media officer, MCB.
  
  The apex court in its ruling said illegal encroachments in cantonment areas would have to be removed in a time-bound manner. The MCB claims that efforts are afoot in that regard. “We have already been doing that for the past few months. The effort is ongoing, and we will fulfil all requirements,” said Zafar.
  
  Sources with MCB told TOI that both tasks — identifying illegal encroachments and removing the identified encroachments — will not be easy for the cantonment.
  
  “It is a massive task as there are about a lakh voters. How can one identify who is illegal and who is not? Also, the task of removing illegal encroachments is very difficult. We removed them in the past, but they came back again,” said sources.
