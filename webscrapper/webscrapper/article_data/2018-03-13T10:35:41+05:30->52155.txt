TRICHY: The Class XII mathematics   in the ongoing   state board examinations, which was held on Monday, evoked an almost unanimous response as both students and teachers felt that the question   was moderately difficult.

 While teachers felt that the paper was easy enough to pass but had questions which would decrease the number of centum, students claimed that it was relatively difficult compared to the mathematics exams that were held in the last few years.
 
 Mathematics teacher at   government higher secondary school, O R  , stated that students found compulsory questions in six mark section to be very difficult. “Even many above-average students told me that the compulsory question was difficult – though it was from the syllabus, it was an unexpected and tricky question,”   claimed. 
 
 However, he added the tough six mark section would not make passing the exam difficult for students. “The 10 mark questions were the expected ones and even one mark questions were comparatively easy,” he said.tnn
