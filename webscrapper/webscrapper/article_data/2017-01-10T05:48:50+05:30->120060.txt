NEW DELHI: With   CM   continuing her attack on the Centre, Trinamool Congress MPs were back in the capital on Monday to stage a demonstration against the recent arrest of some of their party members, which was attributed to the   government’s “vendetta’ for the party’s vehement opposition to demonetisation.

 “We condemn conspiracy in the name of investigation and we condemn atrocities in the name of ‘notebandi”,   member Derek O'Brien said as 30-odd party MPs staged a sit-in at   in the heart of Lutyens’ Delhi.
 
 There were no party banners, which the TMC members said was to ensure that anybody could join the agitation irrespective of affiliation.
 
 The sit-in protest, which continued till 6pm, is part of TMC’s nationwide protest against the Modi government’s demonetisation move.
 
 The party will continue the protest in Bengal, Odisha, Punjab, Bihar, Manipur, Tripura, Assam and Jharkhand for the next three days, said a party statement.
