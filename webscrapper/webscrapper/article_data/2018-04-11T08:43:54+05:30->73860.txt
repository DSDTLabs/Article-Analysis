GOLD COAST: India’s men’s hockey team advanced to the semifinals with a 2-1 win over Malaysia on Tuesday. Not to be left behind, the Indian women also advanced to the last four after posting their third straight win.

 
 India beat South Africa with skipper Rani Rampal scoring the winner. India had earlier defeated England and Malaysia after losing to Wales in the opener in Pool A.
 
 Marijne’s boys built on the confidence following their unbeaten run in the first two matches. They shot into the lead in the third minute with Harmanpreet Singh converting a penalty corner. It was the drag-flicker’s third goal of the tournament and by the end of the match he took his tally to four goals. The Malaysians soon retaliated and forced a penalty corner in the sixth minute but Razie Rahim failed to convert.
 
 The Blues dominated their rivals for long periods but couldn’t make their chances count in the attacking third. India conceded the equalizer against the run of play when Faizal Saari struck with quarter of an hour gone. Striker Mandeep Singh and Gurjant Singh were then guilty of missing chances that could have asserted India’s domination.
 
 Manpreet Singh and Co. then regained the lead back in the third quarter with Harmanpreet again sounding the board in the 33rd minute.
