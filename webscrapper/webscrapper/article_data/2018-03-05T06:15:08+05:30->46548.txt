PHAGWARA: Two days after he went missing from his home in  , a 17-year-old boy was found murdered in Karnal on Sunday.

  of police (SP)   said Karnal police informed them about a teenager’s charred body being found in the   town, following which a team went to identify the body along with a relative of his. “He was identified with the help of his kada, bracelet, and a chain in which his name was engraved. His killers had even burnt his face beyond recognition,” said the SP.
 
 The teenager had gone missing on Friday evening. Though his family lodged a complaint with Phagwara police after text messages from his phone were sent to them on the same night, the case could not be cracked. “Phagwara police had flashed messages in the state and its neighbours about the boy and his whereabouts,” said the SP.
 
 The last location of the boy’s mobile phone was in Rajpura, within a few hours of his going missing. The SP said it earlier seemed from the boy’s text messages to his family that he sent them on his own. “While his family initially suspected he had gone on his own, now we suspect he may have been kidnapped and then murdered,” said the SP.
 
 The boy’s family lives in Baba Gadhia area of Phagwara. He was studying in Class XI. While his father owns a sanitary fittings shop, his grandfather owns a factory. He had gone missing after 8.30pm on Friday. He said Karnal police would carry out further investigation into the case.
