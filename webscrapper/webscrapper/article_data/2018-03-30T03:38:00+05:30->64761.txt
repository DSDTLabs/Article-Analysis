Colva: With four more Olive Ridley turtle carcasses found at Colva and Betalbatim beaches on Thursday, forest department officials and wildlife activists will have to devise a strategy quickly to curb the rise in cases. 

 The carcass of a turtle was found at Sernabatim beach, Colva, on Thursday morning. What remained of it was just the carapace â€“ with the cracked shell. A white shell could be seen lying by its side.
 
 The carcass lay opposite a restaurant, but there was no stench indicating that it might have been fresh. Some foreign tourists put the carcass in a garbage bag and dragged it away from the restaurant but dogs hovering near the carcass kept following them.
 
 When TOI alerted the forest department, some officials arrived at Sernabatim and took possession of the decomposed carcass. Range forest officer Siddesh Gaude said that while scouring the shore they found another turtle in a decomposed state.
 
 A little later, the forest department received a call from lifeguards that two more turtle carcasses were lying at Betalbatim beach, taking the tally to four in a single day. With another turtle death reported at Rajbabh beach in Canacona on Monday morning, turtle mortality has risen to 33 over the last eight months, with an average of about four per month.
 
 Sources said that the high incidence of mortality could be due to heightened tourism activity like watersports and also movement of trawlers nearer the shore. The postmortem report stated that the turtle may have been struck by the propeller of a boat.
