 Bachchan created a magical moment at the 2017 Cannes   as she strutted her way to the gala's red carpet in a Cinderella- inspired ensemble. 

 Clad in a powder-blue brocade ball gown by Michael Cinco, the 43-year-old   looked every inch of royalty.
  
  
 Aishwarya paired her heavenly look with dark-hued lips and kept the rest of her make-up minimal with absolutely no accessories. 
 
 While posing on the red carpet, the Indian beauty gave the best hair flip and even greeted the shutterbugs with traditional 'Namaste' pose. 
 
 Aishwarya made her debut at the film carnival in 2002 to present her film 'Devdas'.
 
 The actress will attend the screening of the Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directed movie yet again at an outdoor cinema event during the festival. 
 
 Earlier in the day, she looked ethereal in a sheer green tiered ensemble by Yanina Couture and was even spotted posing with model Eva Longoria in an off-white floral gown. 
 
  already walked the red carpet on May 18 in a bottle green Brandon Maxwell gown with a sweeping train., while another   actress Sonam Kapoor is yet to attend the event on May 21 and 22. 
 
 The festival runs from May 17 to 28.
