 The couple likes to take off to Bhopal and Chandigarh, which happens to be Divyanka and Vivek's hometown respectively, to spend time with their families. 
  
 The stunning duo is all set to entertain fans with their crackling chemistry on  , a dance reality show for couples. 
 
  
  
 Speaking about their participation on the show, Divyanka had earlier told Mumbai Mirror, ""It's been three years since I started   and I wanted to do something different to break the monotony. For me this is a serious dance stage and not a platform for PDA. Since I have a nagging slipped disc problem and a recent ankle fracture, we took our time to give our nod but now that we have, Vivek and I have started with the rehearsals. I can barely move, but I have to begin somewhere."
  
 Adding further, she had said, â€œI look forward to grooving with my husband and learning from each other."
