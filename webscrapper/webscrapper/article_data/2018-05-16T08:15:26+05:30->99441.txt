LUCKNOW:   celebrations once again left the city in chaos on Tuesday. While the roads were littered with disposable plates and leftover food, the large number of stalls put up on the occasion led to traffic snarls in many parts of the city.

 The garbage mess was visible on all major roads, like Ashok Marg, Lohia Path, Ring Road, and Faizabad Road.
 
 The biggest chaos was seen on Ashok Marg where several stalls were put up at small distances. As there were no dustbins, the waste was dumped on the roads.
 
 Heaps of disposables were also seen near Sapru Marg, Saharaganj mall, Shakti Bhawan and DGP office and led to traffic jams. Sikanderbagh, Sapru Marg and Shriram Tower crossings saw frequent jams throughout the day as people queued up at the stalls. Haphazardly parked vehicles near the stalls added to the chaos. Similar chaos was witnessed at Polytechnic Crossing, Hanuman Setu, Paper Mill Colony, Chowk, Vikasnagar, Indiranagar and Sadar. Eco Green, LMC’s partner in garbage disposal, claimed it cleans the roads after the stalls wind up, but most organisers said they had to hire private cleaners to dispose of the waste.
 
  resident  , who registered a stall with   for Rs 500 complained, “No one from LMC came to pick the disposables. We hired private sweepers for cleaning.”
 
 Raj Kumar Upadhyay, organiser of a stall near DGP office, said LMC offered no help in clearing the waste.
