PUNE: A 22-year-old woman and a retired teacher were killed in separate accidents in   in a span of 17 hours between Saturday and Sunday.

 Retired teacher   (67) of Wadgaon, who had shifted to Pune just four days ago, was killed after a speeding truck knocked him down on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass in Ambegaon around 5pm on Sunday. 
 
 The accident occurred when Khairnar was walking towards a supermarket in Ambegaon with his wife   (60). “Khairnar’s son stays in the US and he had bought a flat in Wadgaon,” S R Shinde, assistant inspector of the   police station, told TOI.
 
 Khairnar was rushed to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. 
 
 About 17 hours before Khairnar’s accident, a 22-year-old woman riding pillion on a scooter was killed in a hit-and-run accident near the same spot.
 
 The accident occurred when Ankita Lohote (22) of Narhe was returning home with her friend Vikas Abesange (25) around 11.30pm on Saturday. “Their scooter ran out of fuel. Failing to find an open pump in Warje, they came to Ambegaon,” Shinde said.
 
 The officer said while they were crossing a road in Ambegaon, a speeding white-coloured multi utility vehicle knocked down their scooter killing Lohote on the spot while Abesange sustained minor injuries.
