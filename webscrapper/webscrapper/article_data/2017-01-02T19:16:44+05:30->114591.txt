 "For the good governance and transparency and cleanliness in sports I have constituted a committee so that we can give good governance and transparency in the federations, in the IOA and other bodies," Goel said.
 
 He said in the past few months, the Sports Ministry has held meetings with NSFs, sports ministers of states, Olympians, Arjuna and Dronacharya awardees and disucssed on what improvements can be brought.
 
 "We are continuously working in this regard. I have asked my secretary to submit a report within one month on what kind of improvements can be brought," Goel added.
