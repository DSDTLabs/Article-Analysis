NEW DELHI: Racing on high-power sports bikes turned fatal on a south Delhi on Sunday when two bikes collided head-on, killing a 19-year-old rider on the spot and leaving two others with severe head and bone injuries.

 The bikes — a Bajaj Dominar and a Hyosang, both with engine capacity of more than 350cc and costing several lakhs — were totally damaged in the crash that took place around 9am in the   near  .
 
 Witnesses said the bikers were intentionally coming towards each other and intended to swerve away when they got too close. But the plan went horribly wrong as a scooterist came in the way, police said. 
 
 Police said they received a call from a passerby and found the three injured youths on the road. They were first taken to a private hospital where one was declared   on arrival. The other two were referred to AIIMS Trauma Centre. Additional DCP (south) Chinmay Biswal said they were racing. 
 
 The deceased, Raman Meena (19), was an aspiring architect and had pursued a course in draftsmanship. He was wearing a helmet, but it apparently came off on collision, police said. The other two were identified as Charles Brian (27), an HR manager with a Gurgaon firm, and Pradeep Nair (27), a private company executive. Nair was riding pillion.
 
 An FIR has been registered and the two would be arrested upon discharge.
 
 One of the injured riders was wearing a camera on his helmet, which was smashed in the crash. Police are now looking for the memory card, which could have a recording of the crash. 
 
 Witnesses said the stretch near Sanjay Van has become a favourite hub of amateur bikers during weekends. There’s a police post there, but locals allege police don’t do much to stop hazardous biking.
 
 Eyewitnesses say that the deceased seemed to be an amateur and was wobbling even before he had attempted the  . “We had heard some of his teammates asking him to stay away from racing, but he attempted the ride,” said a witness.
