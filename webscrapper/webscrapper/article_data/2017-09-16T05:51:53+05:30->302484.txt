NEW DELHI: Income tax raids on onion traders in Nashik may lead to a slight price rise in Delhi in the coming week.

 While Delhi has sufficient stock to last comfortably for another two-three days, onion traders in Nashik went on strike on Friday and if that stretches any longer than Wednesday , Delhi may face a slight shortage in supply of onions.
 
 “The income tax raid per say has had no impact on Delhi. However, Delhi is getting roughly half its supply (or a little less) from Nashik and if the strike continues into the next week, we will probably see a rise in wholesale prices by Rs 5-6 per kg. In the retail market, this amounts to nothing. Furthermore, if supply from Nashik does come down, then supply from Rajasthan and UP will automatically go up,“ said   from the  .
 
 Delhi gets about 100 trucks of onion every day , which could go up to a maximum of 150.At present, about 50 trucks are coming from Nashik, while the remaining are coming from Rajasthan.
