NEW DELHI: For the first time in 27 years, on Friday, five new   judges took oath in a single day, taking the working strength of the apex   to 28, just three short of the sanctioned 31.

 Only once before have more SC judges taken oath on the same day, six on October 6, 1989.
 
 The five judges -Justices  , M M Shantanagoudar, Abdul Nazeer, Navin Sinha and Deepak Gupta -were administered the oath by Chief Justice   in the CJI's courtroom, packed with lawyers and relatives of the new appointees, among others.
 
 The five judges were subsequently accommodated on benches in the first five courts, for which the list of business had already been prepared. This resulted in another record in the CJI's courtroom. For the first time, a four-judge bench comprising Justices Khehar, N V Ramana, D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul -heard the cases. Normally , an SC bench comprises two or an odd number of judges.
 
 Every case listed before a bench generally has three sets of files. But with Justice Kaul's sudden addition to an existing three-judge bench, there was no set available for him. Thus, on his first day in office, Justice Kaul had no case file before him and yet he had one of the longest days in court -sitting from 11.15am till 4.15pm with less than an hour for lunch break. Justice Kaul had to share the case file with Justice Ramana.
 
 Ending a nine-month drought in appointments of judges to the SC, the CJI-headed collegium had, on February 3, recommended the five judges to the Centre.
