JAIPUR: The Akhil Rajasthan Rajya Karmachari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti, a conglomerate of various employee unions, alleged that the   totally ignored the demands of state government employees.

 Aayudhan Singh Kavya, coordinator of the samiti in a statement, said the government had backtracked on its promises. The   had promised new recruitments, regularization of temporary employees and same pay for same work, but it failed to fulfill these promises.
 
 The government had also promised to remove wage anomalies but the Budget is silent on them. The employees were expecting that the government would make the   benefits at par with the pay matrix of central government employees, but the chief minister ignored this demand. There is irony in the announcement of recruitment of 70,000 teachers. On one hand it says it would recruit 70,000 teachers but on the other hand, the Budget proposes to hire the services of retired people on pay-minus-pension basis.
 
 Deputy coordinator of the samiti   said the discontentment among the employees is widespread and if the government fails to correct the anomalies in pay benefits, they would be forced to announce an agitation.
