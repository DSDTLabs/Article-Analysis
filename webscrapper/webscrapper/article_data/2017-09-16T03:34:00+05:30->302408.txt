Panaji: Emphasising on the need for judicious spending on funds, Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar said that a financial vis-a-vis benefit analysis of projects undertaken by the government is necessary. “No government takes this into consideration. I have started implementing it now. I have realised that lakhs of rupees can be saved,” he said, explaining that he scrutinizes every proposal to check whether it is absolutely essential, whether it has priority over other proposals and whether the money spent on it is justified.

 He was speaking at the valedictory function of the two-day regional conference on good governance and replication of best practices at Dona Paula on Friday, that was attended by secretaries and officials from 17 states around the country. 
 
  Speaking at the event, Jitendra Singh, Union Minister for State for Development of North Eastern region (Ind charge) and minister of state for personnel, public grievance, pensions, atomic energy and space, appealed to all states to set up their grievance cells. 
 
 “An important step for good governance is simplification of procedures in the government, making the system transparent and faster,” Singh said.
