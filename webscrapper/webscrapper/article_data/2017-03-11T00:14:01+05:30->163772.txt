Indore: Power supply in some parts of the city remained affected on Friday due to maintenance work by Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Ltd. (MPPKVVCL).

 Residents of Mahalakshmi Nagar and other nearby colonies had a hard time in the morning. They complained of frequent power cuts, blaming the situation due to load shedding. “We did have electricity supply from 11.00am to 1.00pm,” said Kushal Gayakwad, a resident of Balaji Heights.
 
 “With summer season approaching, most people have started using air conditioners in their homes and the load might have increased, leading to interruptions in supply,” said Ramesh, another resident of this area. He added that the company must keep a check on the sudden surge in demand this season as many would likely suffer.
 
 Vinit Kumar, a resident of Mahalakshmi Nagar, said that though the power company claims to provide uninterrupted supply, every alternate day there is a power cut in the area. “On one hand, the approaching summer is keeping many people confined to their homes especially in the afternoon, while on the other, the company is subjecting them to frequent unscheduled power cuts,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, discom officials attributed the power cuts as being planned to ensure uninterrupted power distribution. Officials also claimed they had earlier circulated prior information for the shutdown, while residents complained there was no notification in this regard.
 
 “The shutdown in Mahalakshmi Nagar and nearby areas occured after repair work on the feeder line. Some jumpers needed repair owing to which power was shutdown,” said Subroto Roy. He added that this exercise was to enhance distribution system and avoid further interruptions.
 
 Usually we avoid shutting down power for minor work, especially when it is connected with main supply lines, but at times we are left with no option but to carry out the shutdown, he added.
