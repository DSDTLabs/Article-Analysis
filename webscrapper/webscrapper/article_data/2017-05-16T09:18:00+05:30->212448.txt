Mapusa: Villagers of Siolim-Marna village panchayat at the gram sabha held on Sunday demanded intensified police patrolling and proper illumination of areas, especially, isolated areas in the village. The recent heinous crime where a woman was murdered and her body burnt at Bamonnvaddo is in this village jurisdiction. The ordinary gram sabha meeting of the Siolim-Marna panchayat held on Sunday was presided by sarpanch Alba Sequeira. During the gram sabha meeting, villagers raised concern over the recent case of murder and claimed that taking advantage of the dark in and around the ground, anti-social activities are taking place. There is no breakthrough in the case as the woman has not been identified yet. Villagers demanded that the panchayat should improve illumination near the ground area to avoid any untoward incident in the area and that more police patrolling needs to be carried out in the village. Another major issue which was raised was regarding the long-pending demand of construction of public toilet facility for people visiting the primary health centre at Siolim. The villagers claimed that since 2012, the demand has been put before the panchayat to undertake construction of toilet at the primary health center as people who visit are forced to use toilet in the wards. Villagers demanded that panchayats must take up construction of the toilet facility under Swacch Bharat scheme if the health center does not have adequate funds. The villagers demanded that the panchayat should call for a joint meeting of farmers, water resources and agriculture department to resolve the issue of waterlogging in the agricultural fields.
