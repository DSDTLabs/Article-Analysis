TRICHY: A life convict in   central prison, A  , 35, has passed SSLC exam by scoring 425 marks out of the total 500.

 Working in the bakery unit in the prison, Saravanan is among the 31 prison inmates who cleared the SSLC exam out of the total 39 who appeared this year. Though a life convict, Saravanan, who has served nine years of his life in prison, may be a free bird soon, says the prison officials.
 
 He is among the 250 odd prisoners in Trichy central prison who could be considered for the premature release of prisoners based on their good conduct. “Saravanan is capable of running a bakery unit, if he goes out,” says a prison official adding that he has become calm over the years while keeping himself engaged in work and in studies in the recent months. A very short tempered man, Saravanan, was convicted for killing a man in his neighbouring village during a clash.
 
 “He is now planning to complete his plus-two and is expecting to be out of jail by then and pursue his graduation through distance education while establishing a bakery unit,” said the prison official.
 
 K Vijay Kumar, 40, another life convict for murder, has secured 383/500. Working in the book binding workshop in the prison, the native of   has spent three years of his life in jail.
 
 Among the longest serving prisoners in the Trichy prison, A Ramesh, 40, a native of Salem who is behind the bars for over 15 years, has secured 376/500. When he came to the prison, he had passed the 8th standard only.
 
 On the reason for the failure of eight students, prison officials said that there are three teachers appointed to help prisoners study and clear exams. But, it all depends on the interest level of the prisoners. Those who have failed this time would certainly appear for the board exam next year, said the official.
