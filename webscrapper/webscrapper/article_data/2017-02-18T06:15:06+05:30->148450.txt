Hyderabad: At a time when residents of   and Neredmet are complaining of rising crime in their localities, cops from the area are increasingly being caught in criminal activities.

 The Rachakonda commissionerate has seen at least five cases of cops being found on the wrong side of the law, including two on Friday, since its inception in June 2016. Four policemen were suspended by commissioner Mahesh M Bhagwat on Friday for misbehaviour and extorting money from residents in the newly-formed commissionerate which has otherwise recorded 18,475 crimes, including burglaries, chain snatching and rape.
 
 In the first case, two sub-inspectors of Vanasthalipuram Dharavat Vijay and Mahesh Thota were suspended for allegedly consuming liquor in full public view and misbehaving with colleagues on Valentine’s Day. While in the second case, two constables of Bhongir police station D Shivram and M Ashok were suspended for demanding money from a complainant by promising to clear a police case. All four were suspended after an internal probe. 
 
 These cases involving policemen have only come to underline the seedy underbelly of policing in the new commissionerate. While officials, requesting anonymity, said that these cases were earlier hushed up in the erstwhile Cyberabad commissionerate, complainants were now coming forward to report such issues. Going by the commissionerate’s records and the rise in such cases, Bhagwat said: “Earlier there was not much clarity on the dealings of such police officers. But now even the people have become smart and are coming forward to report such cases.”
 
 The commissioner said a departmental inquiry on the extent of involvement of cops in crimes is being undertaken. “If the charges are proven during these inquiries, we will send the file to the government for further punitive action,” he said.
