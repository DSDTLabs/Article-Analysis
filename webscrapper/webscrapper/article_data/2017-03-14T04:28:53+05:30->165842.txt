CHENNAI: Doctors and staff at a private hospital tagged Rukmani fussy, and even called for a psychiatrist to treat the 90-year-old’s “confused state”.

 The confusion, it was found, was because the staff had not returned her hearing aid after surgery. “Once the nurses returned her aid and spoke to her she settled down,” said neurosurgeon Dr G Balamurali of  .
 
 Rukmani had suffered from delirium, a dangerous mental confusion that affects more than a quarter of in-patients. Risks are higher among the elderly, surgical patients and victims of burns.
 
 On Monday, Dr Santhana Krishnan, senior consultant at the Old age Psychiatry from Tees Esk Wear Valleys, NHS Foundation Trust, UK, talked to doctors and nurses at Kauvery Hospital about how delirium, accompanied by hallucinations, agitation and disorientation, can worsen illness, increase hospital stay and cost and hasten death. 
 
 Some months ago, the India-born psychiatrist started #icanpreventdelirium campaign, walking around the UK hospital with a violet cape and a mask, telling doctors and nurses to suspect, spot and stop delirium. “It can cause serious brain dysfunction and death. But it can be prevented or managed if doctors, nurses and patients’ families are aware and make small meaningful changes in how patients are treated,” he said. In a few days, it became a part of hospital protocol to rule out delirium.
 
 Initially, he admits, most of his colleagues thought he was exaggerating. “I showed it to them that what most people need is just good listening... It’s important to reassure them and keep them comfortable,” said Dr Krishnan.
 
 Delirium isn’t new to India. “We don’t know how many patients here are affected, but they aren’t any less that what doctors in the UK see,” said psychiatrist Dr  . In the next few months, Dr Krishnan will collaborate with Kauvery Hospital doctors, who will create awareness, train doctors and nurses partnering with other hospitals from March 15,  .
