 “This park is important for its potential as a bird sanctuary. It hosts a rich diversity of birds from India and other countries and we are going to now fully involve ourselves in the beautification of the bird sanctuary. The bird park holds immense value for conserving domestic species and plays host to international species as well,” Tandon said.
 
 “The conservation of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary is our primary focus . The park with its rich ecological diversity hosts approximately 300 species and several rare and endangered species. Once the modification is complete, the park will be transformed into a full-faciliated bird-sanctuary,” Tandon added.

 “This is an important initiative. The overhaul, maintenance and beautification of the bird park was long overdue. The Union government’s support is making it possible now. The initial estimates for the project are around Rs 25 crore,” Girish said.
 
 “The sanctuary has immense scope for improvement. While bird visits have been consistent, the park is expected to become more visitor-friendly after this initiative,” I C Singh, forest ranger at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, said.
