BHUBANESWAR:   notched up the first hat-trick of the inaugural Super Cup, helping Bengaluru FC crush the challenge of   3-1 in the quarterfinals at the   on Friday. Alfred Roca’s team will take on   in the semifinal on Tuesday.

 
 Neroca entered the contest high on confidence. But in 33-year-old Chhetri they found an adversary whose individual brilliance proved to be too much for the Manipur side. Neroca briefly threatened to change the script when they cancelled out Chhetri’s opening strike on the cusp of half-time through N. Pritam Singh’s goal. But BFC proved to be a tough nut and Chhetri helped them get over the line with two more goals to complete his treble, his second in BFC colours.
 
 “We tried our best but eventually lost to a far better side. And regarding Sunil, what can I say? He’s too clever and experienced for my young players,” Neroca coach Gift Raikhan said after the match.
 
 On the impending semifinal clash, Chhetri said, “I was injured and was even not on the bench when we played Mohun Bagan the last time (in the Federation Cup final held in last May in Cuttack). Things have changed for both teams since then. But we are here to win the trophy.”
 
 BFC turned up the heat on their opponents early on and deservedly went ahead in the 13th minute with Chhetri starting and finishing the move in sublime fashion.
