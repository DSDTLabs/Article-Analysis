MUMBAI: Putting to rest the concerns of principals in the city, the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations ( ) has assured that the proposed exams in class V and VIII will not be a ‘board’ examination and not require any additional preparation from students.

 A circular issued by the CISCE said, “With the introduction of the CISCE curriculum, it becomes imperative to ensure that progression of students against the defined learning outcomes is carefully monitored. The council plans to do this through an assessment which will be conducted at the levels of Class V and Class VIII in four subjects—English, mathematics, science and social studies.”
 
 The board has claimed that the assessment will only prepare students better for the   and   exams. 
 
 “This assessment is envisaged to be a non-threatening diagnostic assessment unrelated to classroom academic scores, hence no prior preparation on the part of the students is required. It is not a board examination. The assessment would be student-oriented and will be designed to assess the student’s understanding of concepts based on newly introduced curriculum,” said the circular.
 
 Principals welcomed the clarification. “Having checkpoints will help teachers understand if their teaching methodology is on the right track,” said Madhura Phalke, principal of Pawar Public School, Chandivli.
 
 The council clarified that Sanskrit, performing arts and yoga will continue to be optional up to Class VIII. “Today, getting a teacher for Sanskrit is extremely difficult so keeping it optional will help schools,” said Phalke.
