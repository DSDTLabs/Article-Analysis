SHIMLA:   have demanded installation of   along   and other   of the town instead of them being installed only in the areas of the   alone.

 Social activist Nagender Gupta wrote a letter to Himachal Pradesh governor Acharya Devvrat on Thursday requesting him to look into the matter. He wrote that from the last eight years, people have repeatedly approached Shimla municipal corporation (SMC) demanding installation of railings from Chaura Maidan to Ava Lodge but with no outcome. 
 
 The stretch had collapsed a few days back. Recently a car also fell down injuring its driver. 
 
 “It is sad that SMC is replacing the railings near high court area with new ones while totally neglecting the roadsides at other spots which are inviting accidents. The authorities might be waiting for a death to occur to be a reason to install the railings,” he alleged.
 
 Another social activist Nipun Rathore said the problem aggravates during monsoons and after snowfall when stairs at different parts of the town become slippery. “Many people land up in hospitals after falling from the stairs due to absence of railings. All concerned departments collectively should look into the matter to ensure residents’ safety,” he added.
 
 Sanjauli resident Aditi Sharma said that some roads are too narrow where only one vehicle can run at a time, posing risk to the vehicles crossing from gorge side. Civic bodies and state government should either widen such roads or put parapets to nullify risks. 
 
 Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan said the forest department has already put up some net along the Ava Lodge-Chaura Maidan roadside. “As far as risky spots are concerned, we are already installing railings there. However, people can inform us about left out spots. We will swing into action immediately,” he added.
