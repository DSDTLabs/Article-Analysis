NEW DELHI: Whom is BJP Parliamentarian   holding "accountable" for the 
  in Kashmir?

 Swamy's mysterious tweet talks abut "somebody in the bureaucracy". And "PTs" is Swamy-speak for "patriotic tweeples". 
 
  
  
 
 
 The BJP Rajya Sabha member of Parliament is referring to a 
  to the Army, the CRPF, and range deputy inspector generals in the state, which PTI news agency reported about on June 27.
 
 Khan reportedly said in the letter that the "possibility of a sensational attack by a terrorist outfit cannot be ruled out", the news agency said.
 
 The opposition Congress on Tuesday also asked the same question as Swamy did. It asked why the Centre and the J&K government took no measures to keep the   safe when they had intelligence inputs as early as on June 25th that a terror attack on them was imminent.
 
 In this context, Swamy also talked of failed deterrence.
 
  
  
 
 
 A day after Monday's terror attack that killed seven pilgrims in J&K's Anantnag, Swamy told ANI that the civilian government in the state must be dismissed and President's Rule must be imposed.
 
 "This is the tipping point. The civilian government should be dismissed or should be asked to resign, and we should impose the Central rule through the Governor in Jammu and Kashmir," Swamy told ANI.
 
 The BJP MP further said the whole state should be brought under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, and added that Article 370 should be removed by Presidential notification.
 
 "We should now be prepared for military operation, because all other solutions are useless as they are being proved," Swamy said.
