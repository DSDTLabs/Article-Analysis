Madurai: M K   would have been a force to reckon with for the AIADMK had he been the working president of DMK instead of M K Stalin, claimed state minister for cooperation Sellur K Raju here on Sunday. He told mediapersons that Stalin lacked leadership qualities which his elder brother Alagiri possessed and he would’ve created problems for the AIADMK had he been at the helm of the party. 

 Speaking at the Anna birth anniversary function organised by the Madurai urban district wing of the AIADMK, he said, ``It was Alagiri who was more spoken about by our leader Jayalalithaa and not Stalin.’’ Hence if the former had been in active politics he would have been a force to reckon with, he added. 
 
 The minister said that they had joined hands with OPS faction to retrieve their party symbol “irattai illai”. “We will face the elections with our symbol. Only our leader was accepted by the people as their leader and no other actor was endorsed by them. So Kamal Haasan will also be shunned by them and he will not be able to become their leader,” he said. MP Anwar Raja and MLA V V Rajan Chellappa among others participated in the meet. TNN
