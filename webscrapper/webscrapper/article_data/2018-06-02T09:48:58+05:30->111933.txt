HYDERABAD: Ahead of gram panchayat elections,   have set aside their differences to form a joint action committee to exert pressure on CM KCR over their demands. They have decided to go on strike in July, when polls will be held, which will halt supply of subsidy rice in state. State Election Commissioner V Nagi Reddy had recently said they were trying to ensure that the election process is completed by July-end. The dealers' association had served a strike notice from July 1 a month ago. "The government has to take a decision before June 15 as dealers will not pay Demand Drafts to lift stocks for July. The process of payment to book rice stock starts on 16th of every month," a source said. 

 Though dealers have given strike calls several times and backed off after assurances by civil supplies minister, the government is dilly-dallying on conceding to their demands.
