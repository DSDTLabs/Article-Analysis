PANAJI: Deputy speaker and St Andre MLA Vishnu Surya Wagh has shown significant signs of improvement and is able to move, recognize and talk to people, his wife Aruna , told TOI on Friday. 

 She said that though doctors at the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute at Andheri, Mumbai, had given the all-clear for the MLA to be discharged, “he has been kept there to get more rest and for other measures”.
 
 “He recognizes people and talks animatedly. There are no food restrictions and though the hospital diet is vegetarian, he is allowed to eat fish because it is part of his normal diet,” Aruna said in a telephonic conversation from Mumbai.
 
 Vishnu was admitted to   on August 18 last year after suffering a cardiac arrest in Goa three days earlier. He was shifted by air ambulance to Mumbai after doctors at the   (GMC) felt his condition could deteriorate and that he needed specialist treatment.
 
  He had not shown any improvement in the initial week and was non-responsive to treatment by three specialists.
 
 Vishnu is presently undergoing physiotherapy, with his wife disclosing that the treatment could be continued at the GMC if required.
 
 Wagh’s family had earlier stated that his   (PET) scan reports were positive and that doctors had said that his brain was in good condition.
