MELBOURNE:   says we may not see the `athletic'   of old anymore but the Spaniard has a much improved game that should help him add to his 14 Grand Slam titles.

 “Rafa (Nadal) is quick, he is not a 20-yearold. But he knows his game better. It's not only about being quick on court. He reads the game well and has the experience now,“ Moya, who joined Nadal's coaching team in December, said at the  .
 
 Nadal has been coached by his uncle Toni Nadal, who has guided him since the former's junior days and continues to remain the Spaniard's head coach.
 
 Nadal has not won a Major since lifting his ninth French Open trophy in 2014 and 2016 was scuppered by injury . After easing past Florian Mayer and Marcos Baghdatis comfortably in early rounds, Nadal flexed his muscles more than figuratively to put out rising star Alexander Zverev in five sets in the third and, on Monday , negotiated a tricky challenge from French sixth seed Gael Monfils 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
