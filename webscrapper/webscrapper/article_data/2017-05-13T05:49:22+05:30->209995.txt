CHANDIGARH: Haryana has reported 826 cases of wheat stubble burning this rabi season, that is from April 1 till May 10. Highest number of 235 cases were detected in  , followed by 136 in Sirsa and 126 in Sonipat, according to the government’s own data.

 Member secretary of   Control Board S Narayanan said that till May 10, around Rs 14 lakh fine was collected from farmers for burning wheat stubble. “We have activated our basic level teams across the state, and this time the number of wheat stubble  is less than in the previous year. The quality of air is also better,” he said. Stubble burning is being monitored by Haryana Space Application Centre (HARSAC) through satellite imagery.
 
 Karnal deputy director agriculture Pardeep Kumar Meel said, “We have registered a total of 189 FIRs and collected fine of Rs 3.45 lakh from the farmers who set the crop residue on fire.” He also claimed that since the department had launched “intensive programmes to educate farmers, lesser incidents of wheat stubble burning were reported this season as compared to last year”.
 
 Meel, however, said that during the 2016-17 kharif season, 123 FIRs were registered against farmers for burning of   and around Rs 7.25 lakh fine was collected in Karnal.
 
 Deputy director agriculture in Sirsa district Babu Lal said that though they had not registered any FIRs against farmers, they had collected a fine of Rs 4.85 lakh in 136 cases.
 
  officials feel that farmers would continue to burn wheat stubble till some technology was developed to scientifically manage stubble in the fields as crop residue did not decay easily. It also affected mortality of transplanted paddy in next the kharif season if not removed. As compared to wheat stubble, paddy straw does not decay itself and therefore there usually higher number of paddy straw burning cases.
