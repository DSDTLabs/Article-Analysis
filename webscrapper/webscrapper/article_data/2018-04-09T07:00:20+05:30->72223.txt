KOCHI: In a bid to decongest Vyttila Junction, the traffic police has closed down the   signal, the junction where vehicles especially buses used to take a U-turn to proceed to Tripunithura, Aroor and   after entering the NH taking a free left at the main junction. 

 Such vehicles will not be allowed to cross over the national highway as the flyover and   construction works are also in progress. The vehicles would be redirected to take the old Thammanam Road and turn right from   to proceed through NH underpass to reach the Vyttila service road. 
 
 The vehicles coming from Thammanam bridge should also proceed via the same NH under pass, traffic officials said. Measure will be in force for the next few months as the construction of the metro pillar at the entrance of the mobility hub will start in two weeks, officials said. K A Abdul Salam, ACP,   said that the diversion was implemented as heavy traffic snarl was witnessed on the previous days with even ambulances getting stuck at the traffic jam.
