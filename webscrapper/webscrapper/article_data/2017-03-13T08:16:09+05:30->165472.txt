CHENNAI: It was a goalkeeping howler by   against Prayag United (now defunct) four years ago that cost   the   title that year. It was a replay of that howler at the   here on Sunday that hurt the red-and-golds badly - the villain of the piece this time being TP Rehenesh. The goalkeeper conceded two soft goals in the second half that helped   beat the title aspirants from Kolkata 2-1. The Chennai team had done precious little till the 58th minute and nobody would have given them a chance.

 But it all turned around in a flash. Raegan, who had come in place of Tank, passed to an unmarked Nandha inside the box. He hit a powerful shot straight at Rehenesh and the goalie let the ball slip through his legs, just the way Gurpreet did at the Barasat ground four years back.
 
 “Yes I was reminded of that match against Prayag. But it is unfair to put all the blame on Rehenesh. I think we did not show enough desire to win.Even after we let them score the equalizer, we didn't pull up our socks and paid the price for that. I don't know if we have lost the league, even if we win all the four matches from here,” said a visibly disappointed East Bengal coach Trevon Morgan.
