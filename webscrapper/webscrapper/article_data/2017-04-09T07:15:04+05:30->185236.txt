CHENNAI: The nesting season of   has ended and conservationists say the season has been better than last year. 

 The forest department has been collecting   and hatching them at its hatchery in  . Wildlife range officer (headquarters) Murugesan said this year they identified 116 nests between Marina (from near Napier bridge) and Neelankarai.
 
 Around 13,503 eggs were collected between January 15 and March 10. Of this, 7,459 eggs have been hatched successfully. "We hope at least another 6,500 eggs will hatch in the coming days," he said.
 
 Students Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN) volunteer Akila Balu said last year the number of nests was less. While volunteers counted 170 nests last season, this year it touched 260. However, the number of dead turtles washed ashore this year was higher than last year, she said. This year the turtles began nesting in January and the season ended in March.
 
 Hatching eggs laid by sea turtles take a long time. The eggs are laid during the peak of winter and once weather conditions change, the eggs hatch faster. Eggs laid in December and January took 48 to 50 days hatch while those laid later hatched in 46 days, said Murugesan.
 
 So far SSTCN volunteers collected about 14,000 eggs of which 4,667 have been hatched, Akila said. "As far as the remaining eggs, there is no guarantee that all of them will hatch. We cannot expect 100% success," she said.
 
 Between Besant Nagar and Marina the number of dead turtles reported was slightly higher, Murugesan said. "But the collection of more eggs and releasing of hatchlings back in the water has given us a relief this time," he said.
