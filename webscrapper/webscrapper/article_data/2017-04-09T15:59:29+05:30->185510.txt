The song   from the film   was a big shout-out to people, who live life on their terms, and do not have a care for the world. It soon had gone on to become an earworm in no time. Making the news now is the song’s female version, where women are seen venting their feelings out and shaking a leg.

 The video that was out recently, voices a strong opinion about women’s right to walk freely on the streets, to cut hair and wear leggings, among umpteen other things that are often tagged as a taboo by the society. This particular version is not just a mouthpiece of women, but also advocates the rights of transgender. 
 
 This clip will surely give a run of goosebumps, and arouse the need for gender justice as such.
