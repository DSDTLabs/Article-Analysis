When director   conceptualized his film Lee, one thing he was sure about was that he did not want a big star in the lead, whose personal aura would overshadow the character, considering that it has three variations. 'The stars of   are the screenplay and the characters in the story. For my leading man, I wanted an actor who would live the role and whom audiences would relate to as the character and not the star he is. Sumanth (Shailendra) seemed the best choice. He has a screen presence, and gives an edge to the characters he plays by embodying them completely. For Lee, he spent several months in pre-production, preparing for the role, as it has multiple shades and required him to be adept in martial arts as well,' says the filmmaker.
But does the film have a Bruce Lee connect, considering the title, and the fact that Sumanth had to train in martial arts? 'No. Sumanth's character is a karate master and a big fan of Bruce Lee, but that's about all,' says Srinandan. The film, produced by Sarathy Satish, Darshan Krishna, Vinay SB for Vivid Dreams Entertainment, pairs Sumanth with   and newbie  . 'Audiences who have seen and appreciated Nabha in Vajrakaya will see her in a different avatar, while Sneha plays a character who works for the good of society,' he explains.
 Calling his film an action-packed love story, the filmmaker says it will have audiences glued to their seats for its entire runtime. 'The first half of the film will leave audiences confused and everything will be explained in the second half. The flow of the film is such that people will not get distracted,' he signs off.
