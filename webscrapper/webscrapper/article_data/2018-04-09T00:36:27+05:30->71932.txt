GURUGRAM: A group of representatives from   across the state met chief minister   on Sunday in Rohtak over the issue of unjustified fee hike in private schools.

 Parents from Gurugram and  , who were also part of the group, said that they have asked that all private schools of the state should be audited and profiteering in educational institutes must be brought to a halt.
 
 “Private schools across the state have increased the fees considerably and they are charging extra money, such as for development charges, illegally. We asked the CM to conduct audits and cut out the profit from the school fees,” said   from   Abhibhavak Ekta Manch.
 
 Parents also asked Khattar to reduce pass percentage of EWS admission from 55% to 33 percent.
 
 The chief minister assured parents of taking up the matter with officials of education department next week, said Sheoran. Earlier in morning, around 50 parents from private schools of Gurugram and Faridabad also met to discuss the issue of fee hike.
 
 Discussing the way forward on curbing fee hike, parents decided that since Fee and   (FFRC) has not been auditing the schools as required under Section 158 A of Haryana School Education Act, they will move to court against the unjustified fee hike. 
 
 “We’ll be approaching local court against the fee hike in private schools since FFRC has not been doing its job. As of now, we’ll move to court against two reputed schools of Gurugram and Faridabad,” added Sheoran.
 
  While earlier the FFRC conducted yearly audits of selected schools, the process halted after some private schools appealed against its order and questioned its role in the fee regulation.
