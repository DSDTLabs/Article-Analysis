 and sons   and   have been on   for the better part of the last few days, and the boys even had a fun time with their mother   who joined them on the same holiday some time back. The ‘Kaabil’ actor posted a video from their outing in the snow. Hrithik and his sons teach us how to build a snow in this fun upload. 

 Hrithik also posted this charming caption which highlights how the whole snowman story happened, as he wrote, “'Dad, do you want to build a snowman?' 'Sure!'
 3 hours, countless abandoned efforts and 7 escalating snowball fights later....
 'It doesn't have to be a snowman.'
 'Sit back down. We're going to make it one way or the other.' #isntheacutelittleguy#snowmenaretricky #sorryOlaf”
