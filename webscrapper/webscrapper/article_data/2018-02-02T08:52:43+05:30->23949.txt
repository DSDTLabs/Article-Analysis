Commending the   presented by finance minister   for “addressing the critical issues effectively,” Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K   hoped it will bring fiscal stability and accelerate growth.

 In a statement, the chief minister praised the Union finance minister for presenting the budget which was fairly-balanced, growth-oriented and one that focused on development of agriculture, rural development and health sector. “We welcome the decision of the Union government to give a big push to the agricultural and allied sector. The enhancement of the minimum support price for all crops to cover at least 1.5 times that of the production cost would benefit the farmers in a big way. However, implementing this is a big challenge,” he said.
 
 He said the reduction in allocation for some of the sensitive and important schemes like post-matric scholarships for scheduled castes, the   and Skill Development and Livelihood Mission could have been avoided.
 
 The standard deduction of ₹40,000 announced in the budget fell short of the expectations of the public, Palaniswami said.
