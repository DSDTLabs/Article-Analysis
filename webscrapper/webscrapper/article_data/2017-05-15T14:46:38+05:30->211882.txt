CHENNAI: DMK working president   on Monday urged   to direct chief minister   and Speaker P Dhanapal to immediately summon the   to discuss and approve the demands for grants of various departments.

 In a letter to Rao, Stalin said it was "to avert a bizarre situation in which the government money is utilized for schemes announced in the budget without the approval of the House which is the sole authority to give assent to grants and to approve appropriation Bills."
 
 The state presented the budget for the financial year 2017-2018 on March 16 and the budget debate was completed by the House on March 24. As per rule 183(1) of Tamilnadu Legislative Assembly, the Annual Financial Statement consists of two parts -- a general discussion and the voting for demands of grants. Rule 185(3) mandates the voting on the grants by the House.
 
 The Business Advisory Committee of the assembly had decided that the discussion on the General Budget shall be held initially for five days and the session will be subsequently reconvened to obtain assent of the House to the demands of various departments after the RK Nagar bypoll.
 
 Stalin alleged that due to unprecedented large-scale scam and systematic bribing of voters unearthed by the Income Tax department, the election commission rescinded the bypoll. "The speaker, however, did not reconvene the assembly contrary to the decision of the House," he said.
 
 The DMK leader presented a memorandum to the speaker and the CM on April 19 to reconvene the session for debating and passing of the individual demands of the departments and discuss issues like the drought, farmersâ€™ suicide, NEET and the transport strike.
 
 Incidentally, Governor had prorogued the session on May 11.
