BENGALURU: The proposed innovative funding plan by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd for Phase 2A and Phase 3 has caused some concern among a few, top central government officials who wonder if it will succeed when it failed in Delhi Metro construction.

 At a review meeting of   by Union minister for statistics and programme implementation D V Sadananda Gowda, some central government officials asked whether this funding model would actually work.
 
 Defending the proposal, Karnataka minister for large and medium industries R V Deshpande said the funding plan in Bengaluru was robust as the Metro line proposed under the policy is primarily the Information Technology and Bio-technology belt and companies there are interested in infrastructure development. The private companies came forward on their own to chip in for the project.
 
 State and central government ministers, including Gowda, Deshpande and Bengaluru development minister K J George, said the innovative funding model would be used to give companies benefits which would include higher floor space index. “The state government is still finalising the policy,” Gowda said.
 
 The state government and   aims to raise at least Rs 2,000 crore through innovative funding and get the rest from the state government for the Phase 2A line between Silk Board Junction and K R Puram. The total project cost is Rs 4,200 crore, with the state and BMRC hoping the Centre will chip in with another Rs 500 crore or more for the extension line.
 
 
 
 
 On the much-delayed Peripheral Ring Road project, Gowda said the central government will take it up under the Smart and Sustainable Urban Transport Solutions policy of Niti Aayog.
 
 “The PRR will be presented under Niti Aayog to tackle the transport concerns of the city. I’ll speak to the Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari to check if the   can take up the project,” he said.
