MUMBAI: Bombay   on Thursday asked the   to do something about the shortage of   in Mumbai.

 "This is a very alarming situation,’’ said a bench of Justice Abhay Oka and   while hearing a petition for quashing a complaint of forgery filed by a wife against her husband who claimed she has signed on the deed of divorce before a qazi. But the wife refuted it. So when the court directed that handwriting experts verify they were informed that there is shortage of experts.
 
 The judges drew the attention of advocate general Rohit Deo to the matter immediately after he informed them that the government has sanctioned 602 posts to be filled at the regional forensic laboratories in the state. During a hearing of a public interest litigation last month, the HC had rapped the government for filling sensitive forensic lab posts on contract basis.
 
 The judges pointed out there are "only six experts’’ in Mumbai. "See the state of affairs! The city is peculiar. There are so many commercial matters,’’ said Justice Oka. The judges said it is happening in very case that delay is attributed to a shortage of experts to analyse writings. "Every time the answer offered is that the office is heavily burdened. This will affect the administration of criminal justice," said Justice Oka.
 
 Deo assured he would take instructions and inform the court. The judges clubbed both matters together and asked the government to "immediately arrange for Bombay (sic)'' and adjourned the hearing on January 22.
