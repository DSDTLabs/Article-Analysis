HYDERABAD: A   here has directed a   to pay Rs 40,000 to a   for selling a faulty device and failing to repair it.

 The petitioner, A   purchased an inverter for Rs 29,000 on January 28, 2013, from IFFRA agencies. The inverter carried a two-year warranty.
 
 However, Reddy said that from the day of installation, the inverter did not function properly and that his complaints were not attended to by the agency.
 
 “Finally, five months after the purchase of inverter, IFRA agencies took back the inverter promising to rectify the problem. But, from that day they stopped receiving my calls and failed to bring back the repaired inverter,” he said before the forum. He added that he had even sent the company a legal notice in 2014 demanding the re-installation of the inverter, but the notice came back ‘unclaimed’.
 
 Left with no other alternative, he filed the complaint praying for justice and compensation. IFFRA agency was also directed to pay Rs 3,000 towards the legal cost of Mohan Reddy.
