BENGALURU: As   and JD(S) MLAs go full throttle in lobbying for ministerial berths, one perk they’re vying for is an official four-wheeler sponsored by the state exchequer.

 
 As per policy, vehicles used by the previous government have been allotted to the new government.
 
 The Toyota Fortuner used by former CM   has been allotted to his successor, CM HD  . “Currently, he’s using his own transportation,” said a government official. That’s a black Range Rover used by son and cine star Nikhil Kumaraswamy.
 
 Sources said the Kumaraswamy camp is not happy with the car used by Siddaramaiah. In 2016, Siddaramaiah had replaced the vehicle with a brand new one of the same model. Officials said the old vehicle had completed 1 lakh kilometres.
 
 Late Saturday evening, Kumaraswamy opted for the Fortuner allotted to his father and former PM HD   for sentimental reasons. The CM also considers the vehicle number, 6363, lucky. Kumaraswamy had decided not to use any government vehicle till the trust vote was won. “He will use the official car from this week,” said a   personnel.
 
 While a cap of Rs 21 lakh has been placed for every minister’s vehicle, Kumaraswamy will not be subject to it. Government officials point out that most vehicles used by former ministers are in good condition and at least 10 were bought less than a year ago.
 
 “There are also 10-15 cars which have run 35,000-40,000 km and are in perfectly usable condition,” said the official.
 
 The government has set aside Rs 6.93 crore for the 33 cabinet ministers. “If there’s a letter from the CM, then allocation for a minister can be increased,” said a former protocol officer.
