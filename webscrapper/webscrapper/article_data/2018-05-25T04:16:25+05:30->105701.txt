MUMBAI: As the state education department has sanctioned about 10,000 more first-year junior college ( ) seats in the Mumbai metropolitan region this year, activists have raised concerns over the 14   receiving permission to start operations, in the light of the fact that over 55,000 seats remained vacant at the end of online admissions last year. 

 Last year, the department had received applications from 2.6 lakh college aspirants for over 2.9 lakh seats. This year, there are over three lakh   on offer with permissions being given to new colleges or existing colleges to add divisions on an unaided or self-financing basis. 
 
 The government granted permissions to new divisions though there was no requirement, said  , a member of the voluntary organization, Systems Correcting Movement. “Every year, thousands of seats remain vacant, which means there is no demand for the seats,” said  , adding that there was a need to do away with in-house quotas.
 
 Education department officials said permissions were given to colleges to start without aid from government, and hence, could not be denied. tnn
