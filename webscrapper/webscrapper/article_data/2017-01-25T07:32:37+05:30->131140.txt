ANANTAPUR: Police 'handcuffed' the   branch at Yadiki town in   district in the early hours of Tuesday as the 'negligent' bank officials left the doors open.

 A police patrol party noticed at around 1.30 am the main door and windows of the Syndicate Bank branch open with lights switched on. Suspecting thieves inside, the policemen waited outside the bank taking positions. After a while, they went into the bank but found no one there. The police team led by sub-inspector   tried to contact the bank manager but did not get to him. The SI decided to lock the main door.Since they could not find a lock at that late hour, they decided to `handcuff ' the door to keep the bank safe.
 
 “The bank staff failed to lock the main door. It was due to negligence. Since we cannot keep a guard outside the bank till the branch reopens in the morning, we used the handcuffs to lock the door,“ Srinivasulu said.
 
 The bank staff realised their mistake only after they came to the bank on Tuesday and found the main door `handcuffed'. They then contacted the police, who unlocked the handcuffs to enable the employees to enter the bank.
