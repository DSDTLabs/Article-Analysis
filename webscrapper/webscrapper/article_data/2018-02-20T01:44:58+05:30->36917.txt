NAVI MUMBAI: A 76-year-old businessman and avid biker from Nepeansea Road, Naozer Ja- mshed Aga, died in a crash as his   sports bike hit an unmarked speed-breaker on the old Pune highway near   phata on Monday morning. 

 The chairman of  , a listed comp any, sustained head injuries as his helmet was crushed after he was flung on to the opposite side. "The biker was escorted by his car, which had gone ahead and his driver was unaware of the accident," police said. 
 
  As his father disliked biking, Aga had given up racing after winning the 1963 Lohegaon-Pune race, as promised to his father.
 
 
  
 "My father died due to the negligence of the highway authorities as they constructed a new speed-breaker but did not paint it with stripes. There is no 'speed beaker ahead' board too, which is mandatory," rued Aga's son  , 48. "My father had a great passion for motorcycles... Right till the end, he said, 'Even if the bike causes my end, I will never give up riding sports bikes. But he was very careful and never rode recklessly. He was so obsessed with bike riding that when he was only nine years old, he had taken a bike to Pune without his father's knowledge," he added. 
 
 Aga's son-in-law  , who also rushed to the accident site, said Aga never rode the bike in the city. But once a month, he rode to Panchgani via Pune, and he always wore a helmet and other safety gear, like on Monday.
 
 "My father was riding the sports bike to reach our Pune house first, where he was to take rest, and then ride ahead to our Mahabaleshwar house. He was wearing proper riding gear, a helmet of branded quality and complete body suit. Yet, unfortunately, he met with a fatal mishap due to the new speed breaker, which he was not aware of," said Arman.
