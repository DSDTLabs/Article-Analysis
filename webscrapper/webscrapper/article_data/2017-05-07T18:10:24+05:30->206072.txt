DEHRADUN: A joint team of Rudraprayag Forest Division and TRAFFIC India organization nabbed two accused with four   and two   of   in the area between Guptkashi and Kalimath.

 According to Rajiv Dhiman, divisional forest official of Rudraprayag, it was at the behest of the additional principal chief conservator of forests Dhananjai Mohan that the entire operation was carried out. The suspicious activities of the accused came to light with the information given by accused held by the DFO Rudraprayag few months ago with one leopard skin and one leopard cat skin.
  
 Dhiman said, “Such a huge recovery of wildlife organs in this region of Rudraprayag, where no such seizure was made before is an eye-opener. The main accused Chandru Lal, 74 and resident of Raolek village of Ukhimath in Rudraprayag is behind all the killings. The second accused Virender Lal, youngster, is from the same village. Both are concocting the story of having found the consignment in a cave, which is a white lie. However, we are quite hopeful of getting significant information from Chandru Lal which might lead us to a big network working behind wildlife crime,” said Dhiman.
  
 He said that Raolek village falls on the border of Kedaranth Wildlife Sanctuary, so it seems that the Chandru Lal who has a large flock of sheep must be conducting recce into the sanctuary and nearby forests for leopards and   while taking his sheep for grazing. He said the officials from Kedarnath WLS would also be joining in the investigation. He hoped that with arrest of the accused, many others in the nearby villages would learn a lesson.
