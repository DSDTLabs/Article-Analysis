MANALI: A GPS-based smartphone app will now help police officers in   to track the location of cops and even help personnel seek help in case of an emergency.

 Himachal Pradesh transport and forest minister Govind Singh Thakur launched the app, developed by the district police itself, in Manali on Friday. The app will also document crime trends, predict traffic jams, and warn in case of possibility of riots in an area.
 
 The app is limited to the police and people will not be able to access it. It will also allow users to share photos and videos in real time. The software will have ready information on crimes, accident black spots and other data.
 
 Apart from all this, the app will also convey to officers the locations of patrol teams and nakas.
 
 Kullu superintendent of police Shalini Agnihotri said she would be the administrator of the app. “All users can seek help in case of an emergency. They can update us about any happening. For example, if a road accident takes place, the cop who arrives on the scene will upload a photograph, and the app will automatically share his location and alert all. They can also share videos. If anybody needs extra force in emergency, they can seek help. DSPs and SHOs will be sub-administrators who will have access to location of cops in their jurisdiction,” she said.
 
 This is the first time that   are using a location-based app. “Most cops are already using smartphones. We are planning to ensure everyone has a smartphone. We will teach our cops to use the appl. Information on patrolling and nakas will also be shared on the app,” the SP said.
 
 Police believe that the app will help them in better management of traffic, patrolling, keeping eye on its staff and setting of better cooperation between cops and officers. Second phase of the application will be launched shortly; it will include crime data, accident black spots, traffic bottlenecks, areas prone to riots, places having witnessed frequent thefts etc.
