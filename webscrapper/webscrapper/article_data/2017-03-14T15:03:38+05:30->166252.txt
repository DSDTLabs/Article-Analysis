 is a busy actress in Tamil these days. Her producer father   and actress mother   are proud of their daughter too. But few would know that the parents were against their daughter entering films! Menaka herself revealed this in a TV show recently. "We didn't want Keerthi to act as cinema is not what it was in our time. But it was only later that we knew that Keerthi had been breaking coconuts daily so that her father's mind changes. She also told her sister once, if only we were born to another set of parents, I would be an actress now. It was   who finally paved the way for her acting in her first film," she said on the show.
