 Beauty tips from Donald Simrock:
 
 -Our quintessential brides can sport a nude look by glamming it up. Keep your face clean and dewy using a light hydrating mousse foundation and highlighter, and add some vibrant colours to your eyes using an eyeshadow palette and lips using an argan oil enriched lip colour.
 
 -Our bold and beautiful brides can go for professional techniques like colour blocking to give their eye a pop of colour using a vibrant eyeshadow palette and flaunt an edgy bridal look 
 
 -Summers can be harsh on your skin and last-minute breakouts, darkening and dullness can stress out any bride. The best solution is to use a natural ingredient like aloe aqua gel before applying any skin or makeup product. This not only soothes your skin giving it a cooling effect, but also acts like a primer to even out the surface.
 
 -Outdoor functions in colourful décor are dream-come-true for all brides. However, make sure to give your skin the necessary amounts of SPF to protect it from harmful sun rays. Opt for a light matte sun gel or a matte sun lotion
 
 Haircare tips from Heena Dalvi:
 
 -Turn heads by using simple embellishments or even flowers as hair accessories that will flaunt your feminine beauty. Add a classic and gracefully styled bouffant with loose curls to enhance the effect
 
 -The best way to escape the heat is to opt for delicate braids that you can don with embellishments, especially for a mehendi function 
 
 -Be the quintessential bride you are by opting for a traditional yet easy hairstyle that will beat the summer heat. Turn to an easy low bun that will help you keep it simple and classic 
 
 -You can never go wrong with a stylish ponytail. Pin two bobby pins on you rubber band below your ponytail as it will give it an extra lift. This is perfect for a sangeet or a cocktail 
 
 Skincare tips from Rashmi Shetty:
 
 -Summers call for a lot of stress for the skin specially the heat can take a toll over the health of the skin. During summers, excess exposure to sun can cause free-radical damage, excessive perspiration and skin gets sensitive. This can result in speeding up the ageing process.
 
 -To keep under a check, one needs to get their skin care products right. Never step out without a sunscreen during the day time also apply an anti-oxidant serum underneath. make sure you undo the damage that has been done to the skin with your night cream.
 
 -Use a good night cream with Retinol, AHA and vitamin B6, this will help your skin stay healthy, protect skin damage and maintain hydration levels.
 
 -For summer brides, my recommendation is that you keep your skin calm and avoid too many treatments. Use a good face wash which has ‘activated carbon' for deep cleansing because a right face wash can do a lot of good.
