SAN FRANCISCO: In a bid to deliver transparency in technology and stay ahead of ethical pitfalls,   has said that its Artificial Intelligence (AI) calling system “Duplex” would now identify itself while making appointments.

 
 Following the launch of the “Duplex” system, which lets AI mimic a human voice to make appointments and book tables, among other functions, a widespread outcry over the ethical dilemmas were raised by tech critics. 
 
 Google clarified to The Verge that the experimental system would have a “disclosure built-in” that means that whenever   gets involved in some type of verbal communication with a human at the other end, it would identify that the human is talking to an AI.
 
 “We understand and value the discussion around  , as we have said from the beginning, transparency in the technology is important,” a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying.
