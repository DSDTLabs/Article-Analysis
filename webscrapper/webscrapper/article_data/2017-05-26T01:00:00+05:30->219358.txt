Musicians Preety and  , who have sung popular numbers including ' ' and ' ', have gone bald. And it’s for a reason. The two have shaved their head to motivate cancer patients and give them the strength to fight the ailment.

 Preety says, “We’ve gone bald in our new single ' '. We could possibly not have conveyed our message to cancer patients without chopping our locks. We wanted to boost their confidence and tell them that beauty is much more than just the physical appearance. Many are worried that the society might look at them differently when they lose their hair. Instead of focussing on hair and good looks, one should fight the ailment. Life is beautiful and we should not lose any chance to live it to the fullest.”
