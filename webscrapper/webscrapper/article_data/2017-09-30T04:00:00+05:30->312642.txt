Vadodara: In a new twist to the ongoing legal battle on forthcoming M S University Students Union (MSUSU) polls, a student of Faculty of Law on Friday joined as a party of interest demanding that students union elections should be held as scheduled. 

 Earlier this week, former MSUSU vice-president Priyanka Patel had filed a civil suit in a local court here seeking the court’s directive to stay the students’ union elections which are scheduled on October 5. 
 
  Patel had moved court on the grounds that the election notification has been issued in violation of the guidelines recommended by the committee headed by former chief election commissioner J M Lyngdoh. On Friday, Jaydev Acharya, a fourth year student of Baroda School of Legal Studies of Faculty of Law, joined as party of interest in the matter. 
 
 The court of D R Joshi, senior civil judge, has now fixed the next hearing on the matter on October 3. 
 
 “I have joined as party of interest in the matter as students elections are extension of fundamental right. For political reasons, attempts are being made to stay the union polls thereby depriving the right of students to elect their representatives,” said Acharya. It is worth mentioning here that the students union elections have not only been delayed this year but a strong lobby within the university administration wanted that the students union polls are not held at the campus.TNN
