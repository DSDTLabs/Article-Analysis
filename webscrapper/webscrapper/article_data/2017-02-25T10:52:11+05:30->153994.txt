  : Chief minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu spoke on the Manipur polls on Thursday and said   and Nagas were brothers and would remain amicable neighbours. "We have been living as neighbours and we should learn to live together," he added. 

 The Naga People's Front (NPF), of which Liezietsu is the president, has fielded 15 candidates - 14 in the hills and one in the valley - in the election. In the last polls, NPF had contested 12 seats and won four.
 
 Liezietsu announced that NPF had kicked off its campaign in the hill areas and would continue to send its leaders to campaign in Manipur. "If time permits, I will also go to Manipur and campaign for my candidates," he said.
 
 "In the hills, there are tribal people belonging to both the Naga and Kuki communities. Many times, however, they are divided on issues and don't come together for a common cause," he said, adding that all tribals should present a united front in the legislative assembly.
 
 Liezietsu's predecessor  , who stepped down on February 19, also said he would campaign for NPF candidates in Manipur. He expressed confidence that the party would win around 12 seats and play a crucial role in government formation in the state.
