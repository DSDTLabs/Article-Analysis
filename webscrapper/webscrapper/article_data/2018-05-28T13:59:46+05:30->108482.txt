BHOPAL: In a significant judgement, a division bench of the MP high court has ruled that wife has a right to know the salary of her husband. Petition of an   to get a pay slip of her husband had earlier been rejected by a lower court and a single-bench of high court had upheld the order on the ground that salary of a person can’t be disclosed to anyone under  .

 
 According to facts of the case,  , estranged wife to Pawan Jain, a BSNL employee, was receiving a maintenance allowance of Rs 7,000. The woman wished to know the exact salary of her husband as she felt that his salary was more than Rs two lakh per month and she deserved more as maintenance allowance. She filed an application in the district court seeking pay slip of her husband, but her application was rejected. Then, she sought to get it through RTI from BSNL, but was denied details of her husband’s pay. Ultimately, the Central Information Commission (CIC) allowed her petition and ordered BSNL to provide her pay slip of her husband.
 
 Pawan challenged the order in the single-judge bench of the high court, which quashed CIC order, but a division bench comprising Justice S K Seth and Justice Nandita Dubey overturned the order while listening to an appeal filed by Sunita. 
 
 The court said that the Supreme Court order in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande Vs CIC on the basis of which the single-bench had quashed the CIC order was different in nature. In this case, it’s wife who wished to know the exact salary of her husband and she has a right to it.
