ZAMANIYA, Ghazipur: A five-coach train has been plying in just one tehsil in   district, Zamaniya, across the   from   where Lord  , twice Governor-General of Bengal, lies interred. It covers 18 km of track that runs alongside prominent markets, residential settlements and an important road, since before most residents can remember.

 Train No.53643 (the Dildarnagar junction to Tarighat passenger) starts its fi rst leg at 8.15am and ends its last service at 6.50pm, after shuttling six times within Zamaniya tehsil. Apart from stopping at four listed stops, the train also halts at half a dozen more places.
 
 In the assembly constituency that elected SP leader Om Prakash Singh as MLA for six times, the popularity of the train has never dwindled, due largely to the poor road conditions.
 
 Harish Tiwari, 18, an intermediate student, said, “It (train) is the lifeline for people in Zamaniya. The roads are so battered, we avoid using motor vehicles unless it’s really needed,” says Harish, who will vote for the fi rst time on March 8.
 
 Permitted to run at 40 kmph, the train doesn’t even cover 20 km in an hour. At fi ve places, where roads leading to residential settlements intersect the tracks, the crossing is unmanned. “I have spent 23 years in service with railways. I can confi dently say no other train operates in UP this way,” said deputy station master at Dildarnagar junction, AK Mishra.
 
 Zamaniya resident Mohd Karim Raza Khan, a retired government school principal, says the train is “equivalent to the Kolkata tram”. For thousands of people, it used to be the only mode of transport to Ghazipur city, the tehsil, court and other important establishments for up to three decades after Independence.
