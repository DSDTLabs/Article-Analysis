HYDERABAD: The Medical Council of India’s (MCI) decision to bar National Institute of Open Schooling ( ) students from appearing for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test ( ) for undergraduate medical courses has left students in Telangana in a quandary with some even mulling moving court to secure a stay on the decision.

 “Since we did not know who to approach locally, we decided to take the legal route. We have completed all the formalities to challenge the MCI’s decision in court,” said Madhavi Adimulum, whose son,  , has been an open school student since June 2017.
 
 Adimulum said that her son had to discontinue senior secondary school due to financial constraints. “The MCI’s decision has had a severe impact on my son’s health who has been suffering from sleeplessness since the notification was published. He has been studying very hard for NEET since last year. The MCI’s decision to declare this at the end of the year, without considering the future of thousands of open school students who wanted to apply for the exam, is unfair,” she said.
 
 Like Adimulum’s son, the MCI’s move is expected to impact numerous other students, many of whom have floated online petitions to raise their concerns over the matter.
 
 “The NIOS students are among some of the best in the country with a lot of them turning out to be very able citizens. It is an imperative issue, which needs to be addressed as soon as possible. I hope the authorities concerned amend the obsolete laws and help open school students,” said Ainkareswar Pillai, who has floated one such petition.
 
 Several helplessly parents have also rushed to the Hyderabad centre of NIOS for help. “NIOS is a government recognised institution. It is, therefore, ironical that a government body itself is debarring our students. This decision must be rolled back in the interest of thousands of students,” said Anil Kumar, regional director, NIOS (Hyderabad).
