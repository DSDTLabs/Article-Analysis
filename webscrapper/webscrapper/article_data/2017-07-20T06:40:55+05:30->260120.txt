LUCKNOW: Days after the district administration announced compensation to the kin of the victims of  , the   is yet to hear from the officials.

 A technician in railways, Hemant, who was suffering from a liver disease, was admitted to Trauma Centre on July 15. He died soon after being shifted from there to Gandhi Ward after the fire broke out. Family members alleged lackadaisical approach of   staff for the loss of his life.
 
 When this TOI reporter reached Hemant’s house on Wednesday, his younger brother Rajesh wondered if someone from the district administration had come. When the reporter identified himself, a visibly disappointed Rajesh said it had been three days but nobody from the administration had contacted the family. 
 
 With tears in her eyes, Laxmi, the mother of the deceased held a photo of her son and said Hemant was the sole bread winner of the family, comprising his wife, six-year-old son, two younger brothers and mother.
 
  
  Recounting the sequence of events, Rajesh said, “It was 4.15pm on Saturday when my elder brother Hemant fainted at home. I called 108 service and rushed him to Trauma Centre. He was admitted and put on oxygen. I had gone to make the payment for the ultrasound test when the fire broke out. I rushed back to the ward. The medical staff removed the oxygen cylinder and told us to take the patient to Gandhi Ward.”
 
 “Hemant was sweating hard by the time we reached Gandhi Ward but nobody came to attend him. Later, he lost consciousness and was declared dead by doctors. The body was sent to a mortuary and autopsy was done next day at 11am. The report is still awaited,” Rajesh told TOI. 
 
 Denying allegations that Hemant died because of shifting, KGMU officials said the patient was attended to properly and died because of medical complications. 
 
 DM Kaushal Raj Sharma said that SDM (Sadar) had been directed to contact the family for compensation.
