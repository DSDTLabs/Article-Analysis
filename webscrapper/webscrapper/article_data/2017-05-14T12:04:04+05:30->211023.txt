MANGALURU: Women in   are all set to create a record by   to make villages free from   and help  . These check dams will come up at five places in Bantwal, Sullia and Belthangady taluks. 

 While the ZP has set a goal of constructing 1,000 check dams under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREG) Scheme, for the first time in the history of the district, women have been given the task of building five such dams. Meanwhile, the ZP is waiting for more women groups to come forward to build such dams. ZP CEO M R Ravi said it is a great move to actively engage women in preserving water resources. "This is going to be a role model for others and the zilla panchayat will extend all kinds of support to make this initiative successful," he said. 
 
 Zilla panchayat adult education officer K Sudhakara, who is coordinating these works, said women groups will construct dams at Nethilakodi in Naringana gram panchayat limits in Bantwal, Budleguthu in Kanakamajalu GP of Sullia, Bajilmar in Charmady GP, Poonjala in Thannerupantha GP of Belthangady and Hasanthadka in Balnadu GP in Puttur. "All the works pertaining to dams will be done by the women. The project will stand as a testimony to the power of women and motivate others to take up such works in future. Though only five dams have been planned now, the zilla panchayat will consider if more women groups come forward to take up such works," he added. 
 
  The work on a check dam at Nethilakodi has already been launched by Navodaya Self-Help Group president Revathi and zilla panchayat member Mamatha Gatti along with other women members. Work at Balnadu and Kanakamajalu has also been started while the construction in Bajilmar and Poonjala will begin from May 15.
