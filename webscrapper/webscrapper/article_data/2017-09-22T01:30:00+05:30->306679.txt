Lucknow: Surgery, ill health and lack of aid failed to deter Jaya Pandya from planning  ,   and raas events at her home during   to celebrate the Devi Paksh. A teacher by profession, Pandya is among the few who have kept the tradition alive of organising functions to perform the Gujarati folk dance at her home, though ‘dandiya nights’ have assumed a commercial form instead of the simple family and social get-togethers they used to be.

 Pandya, who has been organising the even for the past 15 years, told TOI, “Dandiya nights are more like a party with hardly any scope of playing garba, whereas at home, dancing is a religious ritual. We place the customary ‘garba’ (earthen pot) in the middle and dance around it. The dancing is more of a ritual and we abide by the rituals .”
 
 Dandiya and garba are an important part of Navratra celebration for Gujrati community, along with observing fast and performing puja.
 
 Pandya has been living in Lucknow for past over 25 years along with her husband Anuj who was in government service. The couple settled in Lucknow after Anuj’s retirement. They are one among the 70 Gujrati families settled in Lucknow.
 
 Another organiser of dandiya get-together at home, Ruchi Nagar, a housewife and resident of Gomtinagar, said, “My relatives used to perform dandiya raas at their homes during Navratri but now they find it more convenient to participate in a community fest without bothering about the arrangements. I hold the even the event at home because of religious beliefs and will not discontinue the practice as it is a once-in-a-year occasion.”
 
 Recalling the time most of these dandiya/garba events used to be held at home, Nishi said, “Till a few years back, on each day of the nine days, relatives used to take turns to organise dandiya raas at their homes and sometimes we would get invitation from three to four places on a day but now people mostly go to the big and commercial events.”
