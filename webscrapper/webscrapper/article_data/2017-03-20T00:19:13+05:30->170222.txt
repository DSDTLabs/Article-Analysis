The music of upcoming   film   has nothing to do with the usual song and dance routine. However, it does have a much larger emotional connect to the story line, what with both the lead characters — played by   and Mitra — are visually impaired. In sync with the story on screen, music composer   has decided to present a rather unique concert of sorts as part of the film’s audio launch to be held today. “It was Arjun’s decision to put together a performance that has nothing pre-recorded. He will perform live with 45 musicians — all playing live music on stage for the audio launch,” says the film’s director  .
 Incidentally, Raaga marks Arjun’s 70th film till date out of which he has collaborated with Shekar for the sixth time. “Arjun has composed music after listening to the story, and the sound therefore reflects what you see on screen,” adds Shekar.
