Anushka Sharma, who is busy promoting her upcoming film   with  , surprised everyone with her solo appearance on The   Show. Many eyebrows were raised due to Diljit's absence on the comedy show.
 
 Now according to reports, the apparent reason for him not going to Kapil's show is due to his contract with   channel. Diljit is currently a judge on Rising Star, and that is what restricted the popular Punjabi actor.
  
 As is known, Kapil gained popularity due to 'Comedy Nights With Kapil' which was aired on Colors TV. Later, due to a tiff with the channel, Kapil switched over to their rival,  , and is now a producer and host of 'The Kapil Sharma Show'. 
 
  
  
 Since things turned sour between Kapil and Colors' CEO Raj Nayak, it seems the animosity still persists between them. And there is no letting go of it. 
  
 Talking about what went wrong with the channel and Kapil, Raj Nayak, in an exclusive interview, had earlier told The Times of India, "Kapil Sharma was on television for over 10 years, first on 'Laughter Challenge' and then on 'Comedy Circus' before he did 'Comedy Nights...' with us. He is a nice person and is extremely talented. We gave him a platform and co-created 'Comedy Nights...' with him. It was the channel's decision to call it 'Comedy Nights With Kapil' (originally the show was to be titled 'Comedy Nights'), as we felt that it would give him a sense of ownership and his loyalty to the show would be 100 per cent. We even helped him set up his production company. The success of the show meant that we had a person who suddenly became a star and found it difficult to manage his success."
  
 He had further added, "Kapil started renegotiating and asking for more money which we gave, but the more important and worrying thing was that he violated his contract by hosting shows on competitive channels in spite of having an exclusive contract with Colors for TV, which we felt was not ethical."
