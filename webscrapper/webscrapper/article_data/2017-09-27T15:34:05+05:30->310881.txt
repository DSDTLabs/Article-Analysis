 filmmaker James Cameron has begun the production of four consecutive sequels of his 2009 blockbuster 'Avatar,' with a budget that most of Hollywood movies don't even earn at the Box-Office.

  
  
 Production for 'Avatar' sequels officially commenced at Manhattan Beach, all of which will be shot back-to-back. Not only will Cameron be filming an unprecedented number of films back-to-back, beating out  's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but the budget marks a new record.
 
  Analysts estimate Cameron will spend more than USD 1 billion on the four films, quadruple what was spent by Jackson (USD 675 million was spent on 'The Hobbit' trilogy). The four 'Avatar' sequels currently have release dates, starting December 18, 2020, the rest coming December 17, 2021, December 20, 2024, and December 19, 2025.
 
  Starring  , Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle  , and Sigourney Weaver, the Academy Award-winning 3D production explores the fictitious habitable moon Pandora and the conflict between its local inhabitants, the Na'vi, and Earth.
