HYDERABAD: Telangana and   together have the highest number of engineering colleges that have registered less than 30 per cent admissions in the last three years. 

 According to ministry of human resource development figures, of the 266 colleges in Telangana, 112 registered a low enrolment of 2,874 students, in 2016-17 academic year, as against a sanctioned of 41,628. Similarly, of the 325 colleges in  , 109 registered an enrolment figure of 5,687 while the sanctioned strength was 47,640. 
 
 With the All India Council of Technical Education deciding to not grant permission to institutions with poor enrolment, these figures are worrisome for the two states. 
 
  
  
 
 Experts attribute poor enrolment to proliferation of deemed universities, lack of demand for engineering courses and imbalance between number of colleges and students seeking admissions. "The private engineering colleges are bounded by regulations sets by the AICTE and affiliating universities due to which we cannot admit students who don't qualify in the entrance. Whereas, deemed universities are free to admit students irrespective of the merit system. Therefore, many students are flocking the deemed universities," said  , vice-president of All India Federation of Self Financing Technical Institutions 
 
 College managements claim it is the university's failure in extending supporting to them that's resulted in this crisis. "For four years, JNTUH delayed the sanctioning of affiliations to many colleges. This forced many students to seek admission in elsewhere. Also, the university failed in building an industry-academia ecosystem," said  , correspondent of a private engineering college in Chevella.
