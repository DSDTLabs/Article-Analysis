MUMBAI: Almost 9% teachers' posts in   ( ) schools in the city are vacant, an   query filed by a city-based activist has revealed. 

 The Right to Education Act, 2009, requires   on the basis of the pupil-teacher ratio. As of September 2017, the BMC had appointed only 8,119 teachers though there were 8,900 vacant positions.
 
 Activists feel the vacancies are affecting the quality of teaching. "In several BMC schools, students of various standards have to study together in one classroom due to lack of teachers. Until the BMC ensures adequate teachers, the quality of education will continue to suffer," said Shyam Sonar, who filed the RTI.
 
 Officials, however, said the vacancies were not alarming. Mahesh Palkar, education officer, BMC, said, "The   of up to 10% and the current status is lower than that. Recruitment of teachers hasn't happened for the past two years, but the procedure is expected to begin in June."
