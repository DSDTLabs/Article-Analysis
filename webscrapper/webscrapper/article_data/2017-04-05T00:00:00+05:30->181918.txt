Director   of   fame has quietly finished the talkie portion of his next film. The film, titled  , features supermodel-actress   and newcomer   in lead roles. What is interesting is that the super-glam   is seen in a completely plain-Jane avatar, sporting braces and glasses. “The film sees Shubra in two contrasting looks. The first half of the film has her as someone who is only bothered about her work and doesn’t cares about herself. She is someone who believes that everyone is beautiful from within, and has never given a thought to her appearance. The hero and she fall in love unknowingly through circumstances and then you see a completely different transformation that stuns you. This was one of the reasons I chose Shubra, because she could carry off the two contrasting looks,” says Suni. Speaking about the film’s title, Suni explains that the film is about two people —   and   — who are fans of WWE wrestler  .
