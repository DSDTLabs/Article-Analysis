PANAJI: After a dust   affected flight operations at Delhi’s IGI Airport, a cascading delay in   was reported at Goa International Airport, Dabolim, with   sources confirming that over 15 flights were delayed, and two flights cancelled in the early morning hours of Monday.

 Sources said flights were delayed by as long as seven hours as weather threw the whole system into disarray. 
 
 Recognizing the unavoidable circumstances, the Indian Navy permitted flights to land during the morning hours, a period usually restricted for operations of civilian aircraft.
 
 All domestic airlines operating flights to Delhi were affected as airlines tried to reschedule flights to avoid further inconvenience to passengers. Due to repeated delays, passengers remained camped at the Goa airport. Similarly some flights from Goa to Delhi were diverted because of the bad weather. Air Vistara flight UK884 from Goa to Delhi was diverted to Udaipur.
 
 With delays building up, Indigo flights 6E6236 and 6E617 between Bengaluru and Goa were cancelled. Nearly a thousand passengers were stuck at Goa airport due to the dust storm in Delhi, and airport officials said that many of them took to sleeping in the terminal building at night as they waited for their flights.
 
 Some airlines chose to waive off cancellation and rescheduling fees for passengers flying to Delhi, who chose not to fly on Sunday and Monday. “All efforts are underway to recover from disruptions and manage the situation as expeditiously as possible,” an airline representative said.
 
 By Monday evening, the delays had been resolved and flights were operating as scheduled.
