US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin urged the justice department to review the power that large technology firms such as   have over the American economy, the latest US official to back antitrust scrutiny of the industry.

 A “60 Minutes” segment on Sunday devoted to assertions that Alphabet Inc.’s Google wields a destructive monopoly in online search hammered home the notion of the company’s dominance during a time of heightened public concern with technology giants. The report didn’t include new allegations about the company.
 
 
 “These issues deserve to be reviewed carefully,” Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview early on Monday in response to a question about the   report. “These are issues the justice department needs to look at seriously, not for any one company, but as these technology companies have a greater and greater impact on the economy.”
 
 Mnuchin adds to a chorus of concern in Washington about technology firms’ effects on competition in various markets. Last month, the head of the justice department’s antitrust division,  , said competition officials need to keep an eye on digital platform companies that may be abusing their market power to thwart rivals. And last week, Joe  , the new chief of the  , which shares antitrust jurisdiction with the justice department, told senators he’s aware of the concerns raised about the size of tech firms, and he vowed that the agency would scrutinise mergers and conduct by the companies.
 
 The “60 Minutes” report highlighted how critics and rivals, such as Yelp Inc, are trying to bring Europe’s antitrust approach to Google to the US. Margrethe Vestager, the   competition commissioner, told CBS that she is intent on stopping Google’s “illegal behaviour” in web search, suggesting that the regulator isn’t appeased by the company’s proposed solution for the hefty charges the EU filed last year.
