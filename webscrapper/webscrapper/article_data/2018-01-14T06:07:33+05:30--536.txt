KOLKATA: Days after an accident victim lay bleeding on the Millennium Park pavement with no help coming from bystanders, another youth — suffering from epilepsy — lay pinned to the ground on Saturday morning in one of the busiest stretches of EM Bypass for around 12 minutes with passersby either busy clicking his photographs or just walking past him.

 It took two constables —   and   — from the Beliaghata traffic guard to spot the victim and inform their superior, OC Pankaj Ghatak. Ghatak instructed sergeant Uday Pal to rescue the young man after permissions from   control room and concerned IPS officers. The victim was later identified as Dipak Sharma (18).
 
 The cops arranged for an ambulance and admitted him at the  , where he is stated to be recovering well. When police asked passersby why no help came through, many claimed they were hesitant, fearing “police harassment”. They also “feared” the youth was an accident victim as he lay right in front of an AC bus.
 
 Around 11.30am, Sharma, standing at the   bus stop, had a sudden epilepsy attack and fell on the road. The attack left him at the mercy of bystanders and the hundreds of motorists passing by him. KMDA men, working at the Metro site on the opposite flank, first intervened and tried to revive Sharma. The two cops on duty arrived within five minutes and the police action followed.
 
 
  
 Kolkata Police has had several campaigns where it has been highlighted that no Good Samaritan will be compelled to be a witness.
 
 “Look at our websites and on-ground campaigns where we tried to highlight that there is a Supreme Court ruling that states no Good Samaritan can be harassed. Their statements will be recorded only if they voluntarily agree to do so. But now, it seems we need to revisit the campaign all over again,” said DC (Traffic) Sumit Kumar. The Supreme Court judgment followed a specific PIL from the NGO Save Life Foundation.
