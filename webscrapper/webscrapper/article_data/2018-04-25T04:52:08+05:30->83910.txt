MUMBAI: Work on the   (MTHL) got off to a start with the contractor conducting soil testing in the   creek to set up piers for the 16.5-km route, of which only 5.5 km will be through land.

 The 22-km MTHL will provide direct access to Navi Mumbai and the new international airport as well as a convenient gateway to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and further to southern India. MMRDA’s metropolitan commissioner UPS   said, “Ground work has begun as the contractor is taking samples of the soil at each of the location where the piers will come up.” MMRDA has set aside Rs 2,100 crore for the MTHL project for this financial year. Work on the project is expected to be completed in four and a half years. Around 70,000 vehicles are expected to use the link every day and MMRDA will collect toll for almost 25 years after the corridor is opened. The consortium of L&T-IHI will construct package 1 (Sewri side of sea bridge), Daewoo-TPL (JV) got package 2 (Navi Mumbai side of sea bridge) and L&T will execute package 3 (bridge portion on land toward  ).
 
 Japan has committed to fund 85% of the total project cost. MMRDA decided to execute the project on cash contract after it failed to receive a single bid from the pre-qualified consortia till August 2013. In December 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the project.
 
 In order to provide connectivity to the Western Coast, the Sewri-Worli connector, which had been put on hold due to lack of progress on the MTHL road has also been revived with a plan to have an underground stretch below the Elphinstone Road-Parel station.
