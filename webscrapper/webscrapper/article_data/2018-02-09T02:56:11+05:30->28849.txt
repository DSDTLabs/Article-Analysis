This event is a similar effort and given that it is the first such collaborative initiative, we are very excited about the same,” Rajiv Gulati, assistant general manager, Haryana State Electronics Development Corporation Limited (HARTRON), told TOI. 
 
 The daylong event will not only give the entrepreneurs a chance to showcase their ideas, it will also give them an opportunity to interact with investors and other industry leaders. In the same regard, there will be a One2One speed-dating, where the industry will be given about 20 minutes to interact with each startup of their interest.
 
 This will be followed by a small workshop for the Nasscom members on ‘Software Licence Compliance: Issues and Challenges’, said officials. TOI had earlier reported that though the state government had notified its startup policy after a two-year delay, groundwork as per the policy was yet to start.
 
 It was in the same regard that the state government decided to form a startup cell to ensure the implementation of the schemes and projects under the policy.
 
 A few specific projects which would be monitored by the startup cell include the setting up of the   village and Centre for Women Entrepreneurs. Further, a committee formed by government committee shall conduct a review of all the incubators funding ventures under the policy.
