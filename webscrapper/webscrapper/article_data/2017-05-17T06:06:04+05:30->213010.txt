MUMBAI: Say you own a 1000sq ft flat in   where the ready reckoner rate (official rate fixed by government) for land is Rs 81,000 per sq m. If you were to transfer it to your spouse, sibling or child, stamp duty would be a mere Rs 200-500, depending on the nature of the plot. On Tuesday, however, the state cabinet decided on a steep hike in duty on such gift deeds, which will put the outgo on the Chembur property at Rs 2.4 lakh.

 The decision, aimed at boosting revenue, will result in government charging 3% of ready reckoner rate as stamp duty if a flat is gifted to a blood relative or a spouse.
 
 The move to amend the Maharashtra Stamp Duty Act will impact on both gift deeds and conveyance deeds (which establish the transfer of a property in the name of another person). By approving it, the cabinet has overturned another decision by former revenue minister  , who had done away with stamp duty on gift deeds. Before Khadse's tenure, the government was charging 2% of the land value on gift deeds. The relevant amendment in section 34 of the stamp duty Act is expected to fetch up to an additional Rs 200 crore in revenue. An amendment will also be carried out in sec tion 25 to increase duty on conveyance deeds in rural and peri-urban areas of the state.
 
 Stamp duty on conveyance deeds in gram panchayat areas goes up from 3% of land rate to 4%. Stamp duty rate in peri-urban areas which are governed by municipal councils, some of them in the Mumbai metropolitan region ( ), has been increased from 4% to 5%. The rate for conveyance in municipal corporation areas, however, remains unchanged at 5%.
 
 In another decision, government has allowed payment of stamp duty and registration using the electronic secured bank cum treasury receipts (E-SBTR) for denominations of more than Rs 100; it was earlier for amounts of more than Rs 5,000. This method of collection of revenue is considered to be safe as stamp papers can be tampered.
