Thereâ€™s nothing better than music and dance to pep you up. And the guests at this popular restobar did just that. When we landed at the venue, we spotted a bunch of happy youngsters setting the dance floor on fire. With the DJ belting out commercial tracks, one after the other, the mood at the venue was peppy. While Pulak and Shatabhisha were seen engrossed in conversation,   and   gave many friendshipgoals. Girl gang Kajal, Chaarvi, Richa and Darshika seemed to be making the best of their night out, catching up with each other over good food and making some great memories.
