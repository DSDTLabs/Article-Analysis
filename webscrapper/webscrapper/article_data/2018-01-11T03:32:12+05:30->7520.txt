Kolkata: Overruling the Bengal government’s refusal to allow a 2,000-motorcycle rally by   youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha from Contai to Cooch Behar town from January 11-18, the Calcutta High Court ruled on Wednesday that BJYM could go ahead with its rally provided the two-wheelers moved in an orderly fashion without disturbing regular traffic.

 Justice Debangshu Basak further directed that the organisers inform all police stations that have jurisdiction over areas the rally will pass through. Such information should be provided at least half an hour before the rallyists enter their areas. The court also directed that the rally abide by conditions set by the administrations of the districts it will cover.
 
 The court was hearing a writ petition moved by BJYM member Debojit Sarkar. Holding that the petition was maintainable, it observed that apprehensions about the rally disturbing Ganga Sagar pilgrims — the reason for refusal cited by the state — had no basis. It also held that the rights of political parties to hold rallies could not be denied and administrative policies could not stand in the way of such rallies.
 
 Responding to another petition filed by Hindu Jagran Manch, Justice Basak also overruled the state’s refusal of permission to HJM to hold a function near Basanti bridge of South 24 Parganas between 1.30pm and 4.30pm on January 12.
