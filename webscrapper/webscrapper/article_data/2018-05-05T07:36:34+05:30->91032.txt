MUMBAI: The proposed  , which is to connect D N Nagar in Andheri and Mankhurd, has overcome a major hurdle as   authorities have relaxed   for the   that was to pass through S V Road opposite  . The corridor was to pass under the approach path of landing aircraft. 

 The Metro viaduct will be at a distance of about 90m from the starting point of   26 at Juhu aerodrome.
 
 “The permissible height for the viaduct, including train and overhead equipment, is 16.15m, but we have been allowed to operate at a height of 16.76m from the mean sea level,” said an MMRDA official. 
 
 The road level from the mean sea level is 4m, so the Metro corridor will be at 12.76m. The official added, “The height of the Metro at the station is at a higher level because the concourse level is built at 5.5m. We then have to factor in adequate height between the concourse and the platform.”
