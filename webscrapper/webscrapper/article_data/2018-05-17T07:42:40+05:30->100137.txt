BENGALURU: Karnataka JD(S) president H D   on Wednesday alleged that   offered Rs 100crore and ministerial berths to some of his party MLAs to switch to the saffron party . 

 "BJP leaders have been contacting some of our MLAs and offering money and ministerial berths to join hands with them. It's a serious matter and the governor should stop this," Kumaraswamy told reporters after being elected JD(S) legislature party leader.
 
 He warned that he is capable of engineering a split in BJP if the latter continued with its efforts to woo JD(S) MLAs. "My request to BJP is that it should not resort to nefarious methods to get the numbers. If they do, we will also resort to such tactics," he added.
 
 He said BJP was in a hurry as it was trying to form the government with no numbers. "I have the support of 117 MLAs," he added.
 
  Kumaraswamy claimed that he had an offer from BJP to align with it to form the government, but he chose to go with   as he did not want to hurt his father and former PM H D  . "I have given my father enough pain by joining hands with BJP in the past. My decision was a black spot on my father's political career. I don't want to repeat the same mistake again," he said. 
 
 Without naming Congress, he blamed it for BJP's good show at the hustings. "BJP managed to win so many seats because of efforts of some leaders who tried to finish off JD(S). Otherwise, BJP would not have crossed 80," he said.
