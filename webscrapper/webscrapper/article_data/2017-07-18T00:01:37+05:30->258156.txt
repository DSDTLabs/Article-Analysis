Chennai: Madras high court on Monday reserved its order on a plea moved by AIADMK (Amma) deputy general secretary TTV   to quash the Enforcement Directorate (ED) cases registered against him for violations of Foreign Exchange Regulations Act (FERA). The cases were registered in 1995-96, and an economic offences court had commenced trial, after framing charges against him.

 When the plea came up for hearing, the additional solicitor-general G Rajagopalan, representing the ED, said trial had been pending for over two decades and adequate opportunities given to the accused to submit his objections.
 
 The allegation made by the accused that the trial court had failed to provide him opportunity to make submissions before framing charges is not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed, he added. The additional solicitor-general also wanted the court to vacate the interim stay imposed by the court on further proceedings in the trial court.
 
 The case against Mr. Dhinakaran is that he acquired $1,04,93,313 in foreign exchange without obtaining prior permission from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and deposited it in the current account of Dipper Investments Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and having account with Barclays Bank, Sutton, United Kingdom. Charging him under FERA violation, the ED imposed a penalty of â‚¹28 crore.
 
 Subsequently, in 2015, the Special Court discharged him from the case, against which the ED preferred an appeal and secured a favourable order quashing the discharge and a direction to the trial court to proceed with the trial.
 
 Finally on April 19, the trial court framed charges against Mr. Dhinakaran based on the charge-sheet filed by the investigating agency.
 
 On July 7, Dhinakaran once again approached the high court and secured an interim stay on further proceedings against him in the trial court
