MARGAO: Goans For Dabolim Only ( ) on Saturday urged the newly-elected legislators “to respect the 2017 election verdict and scrap the proposed   so that the state can usher in a model of development that is truly centered around Goa and Goans”.

 Speaking to reporters, GFDO convener   said, “It is no coincidence that governments, which did not support the demand for scrapping and denotifying this draconian and destructive plan, were rejected. The people of Goa have realised that, contrary to the claims of the outgoing   government,   is certainly not a job generator.”
