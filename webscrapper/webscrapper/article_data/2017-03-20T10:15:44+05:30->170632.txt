HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum here has directed a private hospital to pay Rs 75, 000 towards medical expenses and compensation to a patient who underwent surgery under   for failing to provide free treatment for a period of one year post surgery.

 K Venkatesh, admitted his son   at  , Banjara Hills, on June14, 2010. The very next day, the boy was operated upon for 'Pancreatic Body and Tail Necrosis' by a consultant doctor under   and was discharged on June 23, 2010.
 
 Within a month, Ramudu developed post-operative complications and was rushed to the hospital. “But the doctor who conducted the surgery was not with Times Hospital. As the discharge sheet stated the postoperative services would be given free for a period of one year from the date of operation and the surgeon who conducted the operation can be consulted, we tracked down the doctor and admitted our son in the hospital where the surgeon was working,“ said Venkatesh. He complained that due to lack of improvement in his son's condition he had to shift the boy to other hospitals and spend thousands of rupees.
 
 Requesting the forum to dismiss the claim, the opposite party said, “We had no knowledge about the subsequent treatments taken by the complainant from the consultant doctor or at any other hospital. However, he did approach us later and after a comprehensive investigation the child was again admitted and was given free treatment as per rules. The pa tient (and his attendant) got himself discharged against advice of competent doctors.“
 
 The bench said, “The hospital collected fees from the government with an understanding that they would provide free treatment to the patient after discharge via the same doctor who conducted the surgery and also medical testes, but failed to do so. So it is unfair trade practice.“ Apart from compensation, Rs 5000 was awarded towards costs.
