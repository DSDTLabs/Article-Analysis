BENGALURU: BJP state unit spokesperson and legislative assembly member S   on Friday filed a complaint with city police commissioner T Suneel Kumar against chief minister Siddaramaiah and state   working president   for their remarks that “BJP and RSS are terrorists”.

 “Chief minister Siddaramaiah on January 10 made a public statement in which he branded members of BJP and RSS as terrorists. Being the chief minister of Karnataka, he is misusing his position to spread blatant falsehoods against BJP, with an ulterior motive of reaping political gains. He has knowingly made irresponsible statements to malign a national party like the BJP,” Suresh Kumar said.
 
 Alleging that a complete breakdown in the law and order situation in the state has resulted in deaths of numerous Bharatiya Janata Party and RSS activists, Suresh Kumar said that “instead of taking proper and prompt action to reign in terror elements” Siddaramaiah is “shrugging off responsibility by falsely alleging terror links to the BJP”.
 
 The complaint also said that Dinesh Gundu Rao had said the BJP is like a terror organization. “This statement is baseless, malicious, derogatory, defamatory and false... creating enmity between citizens by creating a wrong impression of BJP among people,” it read.
 
 The BJP demanded that police take action against Siddaramaiah and Dinesh Gundu Rao for defamation and promoting enmity between citizens under IPC section 153A and other provisions of the law. 
 
 Suresh Kumar said he is hopeful of action. “Otherwise, we will take the fight to the next level. Siddaramaiah knows his party will lose power in the next election and is trying to defame us,” he said.
 
 Several senior BJP leaders were part of the delegation that met the commissioner. Suneel Kumar said, “We will examine the complaint first and decide the future course of action.”
