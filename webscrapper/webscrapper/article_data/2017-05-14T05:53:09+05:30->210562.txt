SAHARSA: With the D-day for the   council election approaching closer, political temperature of the divisional headquarters town has escalated as allegations and counter allegations by rival candidates fly thick and fast.

 The SDO (civil), who is the election officer, has ordered FIRs against two   for violating the model code of conduct. Prabha Singh, a candidate in ward number 9, is alleged to have encroached upon government land for construction of toilets. According to an official letter, Prabha Devi’s son, Chandan Singh, has built toilets and sunk tube-wells to lure voters in favour of his mother. 
 
 In another case, Ranjana Singh contesting election from ward number 22 is alleged to have distributed more than 20 tube- wells and more than one hundred ‘saris’ among voters. 
 
 The FIRs have been lodged in the   police station.
