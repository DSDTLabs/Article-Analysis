MUMBAI: The Bombay HC on Thursday directed the state government to scrupulously follow its direction not to reveal the identity of persons complaining about   pollution.

 “Common man won’t complain if there is no protection. This will just discourage them,” said a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and  , adding that the government will have to chalk out modalities to ensure protection of the identities of complainants.
 
 
  
 
 In its 2016 judgment, on a clutch of PILs, the HC issued several directions including setting up of a grievance redressal mechanism. It had specifically directed that complainants’ identities be masked and not disclosed.
 
 While checking compliance, the judges, at an earlier hearing, were told by  , advocate for a petitioner  , that in November 2017, he had lodged a complaint of noise pollution in his area on the police control number. But his number was disclosed by the   police station in response to a query by a third party under RTI Act. The judges were livid that this had happened to a “member of the bar”.
 
 The state’s advocate accepted that a “mistake” was committed. The judges said the object of the direction to mask the identity is to ensure there is no threat to the complainant. They said the government shall scrupulously follow the direction and the home department or the office of the director general of police “will have to step in by issuing directions”. The judges directed the government to file affidavit “showing steps taken to ensure such breaches do not take place”.
