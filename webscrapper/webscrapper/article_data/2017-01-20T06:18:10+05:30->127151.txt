HYDERABAD: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( ) on Thursday came down heavily on chief minister K   for promising 12%   in the state.

 The chief minister’s statement on providing 12% reservation to Muslims is nothing but “uncouth minority vote bank politics,” party spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao said in a statement. The BJP, he said, strongly disapproves “this pandering for Muslim votes by Chandrashekar Rao, who holds the constitutional position of the chief minister.”
 
 The chief minister is aware that the reservation limit set by the   cannot be violated. Further, the Supreme Court has been clear that reservations cannot be provided on the basis of religion. “KCR is still making this kind of deviant statements. His designs only expose his pro-Muslim, anti-Hindu, anti BC/SC/ST mindset. Any new reservation has to be drawn from the quota assigned to BC, SC and STs,” he said.
 
 The BJP considers the chief minister’s statement in the   on Wednesday as an unforgivable misadventure negatively affecting the economically backward classes, he added.
