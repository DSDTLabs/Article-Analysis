NEW DELHI:   (RDEL)’s Gujarat-based Pipavav shipyard on Tuesday became the first private shipyard in India to launch two naval offshore patrol   (NOPVs). The vessels were part of a five-ship project being constructed by the company for the Navy.

 Reliance Defence and Engineering CEO Rajesh Dingra said, “The rest three will be launched by 2018-end. We are also expecting to bag large naval orders — one Rs 20,000cr project for four landing platform docks and 16 shallow water craft project worth Rs 10,000cr.”
 
 Vice Admiral  , the flag officer commanding-in-chief western naval command, called the launch of ships ‘Shachi’ and ‘Shruti’ a “milestone event” and said “opening up of warship building to private sector is an opportunity the sector must make full use of ”.
