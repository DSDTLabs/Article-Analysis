Mumbai: Two more churches reported having been denied   permission to use loudspeakers for   and   masses on the open ground of their attached schools. These churches fall in silence zones and the police are acting on a high court order that prescribes a ban on the use of loudspeakers.

 Now, MLA Ashish Shelar has petitioned CM Devendra Fadnavis to urge the authorities to permit   as usual. “These masses are central to the Christian religion and Easter is the most important period of the Christian faith. This peace loving community has contributed so much to health and education,” he wrote.
 
 Shelar told TOI, “The CM has asked the police commissioner to address the matter with a positive outlook.”
 
 Easter is the most important festival on the Christian calendar, even more than Christmas, for it symbolises resurrection, or eternal life. Maundy Thursday falls on April 13, Good Friday on April 14 and Easter is April 16. Mass will be celebrated on the evening of April 15.
 
 On Tuesday, Sacred Heart Church in Vashi and a church in the western suburbs were in a quandary after the police quoted a high court order to deny loudspeakers for mass.
 
 In August 2016, the Bombay high court had passed a detailed judgement which mentioned that loudspeakers cannot be used in a silence zone. The state government had issued a notification to police across the state not to grant permission for use of loudspeakers in silence zones.
