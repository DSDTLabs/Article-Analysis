Chennai: The EOW-CID police have arrested the MD and two directors of the Thiripura Chit Fund Private Limited, who have been accused of cheating depositors. The two who remained elusive for long were picked up from different city hotels on Thursday. 

 The EOW-CID officers have been tracking the movements of the prime suspects by deploying informers and following their mobile tower locations. The police received a tip that the suspects would be moving into some city hotels in Guindy. Accordingly, a police team monitored the movements of the people and narrowed down on one of the directors of the firm Venu Achuthan Nair, 48, a native of Kerala, in front of the ITC Grand Chola.
 
 Soon after his apprehension, the police team received another tip about firm MD P V Krishna Prasad, 52, his wife and one of the board of directors of the firm K Sumannah, 49, going to Radisson Blu near Meenambakkam. They picked up the two accused.
 
 The team took them to their office inside SIPCOT in Guindy. They slapped a case on the three under the IPC Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) and Section 5 of (Tamil Nadu Prevention of Depositors Investment Act) TANPID Act. 
 
 As the news of apprehension spread, depositors started to protest outside the EOW office demanding action. The trio were remanded in Puzhal prison. They will be produced before a special court.
 
 During questioning, Krishna Prasad told police the firm has more than 70,000 depositors across India. 
 
 The firm has cheated 350 depositors from Chennai of more than Rs 40 crore. The firm might have duped 70,000 depositors of more than Rs 1,500 crore.
