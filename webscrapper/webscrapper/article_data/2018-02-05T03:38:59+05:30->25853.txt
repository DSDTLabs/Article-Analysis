NAVI MUMBAI:   of criminal breach of trust against three   for allegedly decamping with a Rs 2 crore consignment of   from a company’s godown in New Panvel, apart from Rs 2 lakh cash and a company car.

 While the three are absconding, police recovered the glass beads, meant for artificial jewellery, packed in 1,150 corrugated boxes and hidden at a rental godown in Bhiwandi.
 
 Yang Lu, Zhao Wing and Bishu Ra had come down from China about two weeks back to work at the company on behalf of its Chinese director.
 
 Senior inspector   said, “It seems to be the outcome of a dispute over payment of income tax and excise duty between two directors, one of them a Chinese, at   in Sector 11, New Panvel. The trio, who had the office and godown keys as they slept at the office, hired a container and took away the boxes on January 26. They also stole Rs 2 lakh, two laptops and the car provided for office use. A police complaint was lodged by company director, Abrar Shaikh (30), a resident of  , after he returned from Delhi. 
 
 The three had even changed the password settings of the digital video recorder of the CCTV cameras at the godown. But we traced the consignment to Bhiwandi. The godown owner, Anil Pawar, claimed he was unaware the goods were stolen as he regularly rented out his godown to the company.”
 
 More said, “We have checked with the immigration authorities at the international airport and learnt that the three have not returned to China. They are untraceable as they have switched off their company mobile phones.”
