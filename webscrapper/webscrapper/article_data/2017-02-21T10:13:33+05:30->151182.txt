ALAPPUZHA: In the wake of the alleged rape of a popular actor, many young stars and their parents have come out demanding proper security measures in place for the safety of women working in the film industry.

 According to actor Namitha Pramod, though many projects have been announced for the safety of women the authorities were not keen in executing the same.
 
  “We have pink police patrol, an initiative for the safety of women. But it doesn’t cover all areas and not effective too,” pointed out Namitha who also demanded an emergency police   number.
 
 Actor Shweta Menon too echoed similar demands. “If a celebrity had to face this in public, I can’t imagine the situation of ordinary women. The legal system should be revamped. A common emergency number to contact the authorities at any time would be much helpful,” she said.
 
 Actor Bhama too sought a helpline number adding that it would be helpful not only to alert authorities and lodge complaints but also to guide women during emergency situations. 
 
 Playback singer Rimi Tomy too shared her concerns of being away from home continuously for many days for work.
 
  “We are in a state of shock after the Kochi incident. The government must take immediate measures to ensure safety of all women,” she said.
 
 Baby Kurian, mother of actor Mithra Kurian, said, “Many young actresses are accompanied by their parents when they travel for work. But, it won’t help if it is a planned attack. Stricter laws are the need of the hour. Also, the film industry should stop employing criminals.”
