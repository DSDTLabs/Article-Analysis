NEW DELHI: With chief minister   calling an all-party meeting on Wednesday over the   issue,  , Congress and AAP are set to share a common platform after months of blaming each other. Representatives of the SC-appointed monitoring committee, which is carrying out   on directives of the apex court, are likely to attend the meeting. 

 “All cabinet ministers, led by the CM himself, will attend the meeting. Members of all parties have been invited,” a government official said. 
 
 BJP, which skipped the previous such meeting, has decided to join it this time. “We will go to the meeting because it’s important to talk to the committee. We will try to find solutions through discussion,” leader of opposition Vijender Gupta said. He claimed that “Delhi BJP had recently suggested the Delhi government to   the monitoring committee, which it should have done by now”. Sources said   president Manoj Tiwari could also attend the meet.
 
 Delhi Congress has already expressed its desire to be a part of the meeting. The party had attended the all-party meeting held at Kejriwal’s residence earlier. 
 
 Last week, Kejriwal had written to the monitoring committee seeking an appointment for the council of ministers. He later told the assembly that he would like all parties to attend it. The government has maintained that only an ordinance brought in by the Centre or a Bill to amend the existing laws could stop the sealing drive.
