HYDERABAD: To be or not to be with Congress. That is the question the CPM leaders will grapple with as they begin deliberations on Thursday on the draft political resolution at the ongoing 22nd party   here.

 With declining electoral fortunes and a sharp erosion in numbers in the strongholds like   and Tripura, the issue of ‘electoral understanding’ with Congress, currently the bone of contention, is likely to play out on how CPM finds itself working with other secular and democratic forces for the 2019 parliamentary polls.
 
 The CPM’s internal divide over Congress is also, in many ways, self-contradictory. In Parliament, the party has worked together with Congress on various issues, the most recent being the efforts to bring an impeachment motion against Chief Justice of India Dipak  . The move, led by general secretary Sitaram  , saw both Congress and CPM MPs as key players before it petered out. The two parties also moved noconfidence motions against the NDA government and sought debate over the banking scam.
 
 On Wednesday, even as Yechury and CPI general secretary   hinted at the need to be more inclusive, both laid emphasis on “alternative policy structures” and people’s movements to counter BJP. “Political parties are free to draw their own electoral tactics. But launching mass resistance to fascist policies cannot be delayed any more...We should build a broad Left and democratic unity. It means forging unity among all those forces, groups and parties which agree on a minimum democratic programme which includes defence of secularism and pro-people economic policies,” Reddy said.
