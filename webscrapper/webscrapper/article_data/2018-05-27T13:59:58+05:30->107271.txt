 “Each state now has an export commissioner. We are interacting with industry bodies, trade associations and other stakeholders apart from export commissioner and industry commissioner to identify potential of each district,” he said, adding that district collectors too will be consulted to formulate strategies whereby export can be promoted. 
 
 “For instance, we already know that Vadodara is home to pharma and chemical clusters. We will be taking feedback from stakeholders on how exports can be promoted. What are the infrastructure challenges or how to increase their international competitiveness,” he said. 
 
 DGFT officials added that coordination between different government agencies will be enhanced.
