PANAJI: Only 1,200-odd government employees and police personnel cast their postal ballots during the day-long facilitation camp organized by the chief electoral office on Saturday.

 Over 17,500 government employees and police personnel appointed on polling duty on February 4 were handed postal ballots and given until 8 am on March 11 counting day to cast them. Prior to the facilitation camp, 2,060 from North Goa and 5,200 from South Goa sent in their ballots.
 
 The camp, organized in the offices of all returning officers, had sealed boxes ready to receive the ballots. It was expected to attract a large number of government employees who were yet to cast their vote. But, only 700-odd out of 6,300 turned up to cast their ballot in North Goa, while 510 of the pending 3,900 in South Goa completed the process. The poor response is attributed to short notice given for the camp, an official said. 
 
 Those who received postal ballots, have to record their vote on the ballot paper provided and secure it in an envelope marked ‘A’. 
 
 They have to obtain attestation by any gazetted officer, or presiding officer of the polling station in which they were on election duty. They then have to make a declaration before the authorized officer and sign it in his presence.
