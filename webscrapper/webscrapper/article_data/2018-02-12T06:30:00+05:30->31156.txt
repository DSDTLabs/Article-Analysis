Hubballi: The   (SWR), which has been criticized for lack of maintenance, has decided to provide more mugs in   and deploy more housekeeping staff on board. 

 While the SWR has claimed that it successfully implemented the   by installing bio-toilets, a   (CAG) report presented in the   in December last year revealed the pathetic condition. The report stated out of 1.02 lakh cases of choking in 2016-17. The highest number — 34,841 cases (or 34%) — was noticed in toilets maintained by the Bengaluru Coaching Depot.

The complaints are there with regard to the maintenance of bio-toilets. We have ensured that the toilets are cleaned at stations. We have kept housekeeping staff on board trains. They are trained to address the issue like the choking of toilets. As far as the mugs are concerned, we have provided sufficient number of mugs. It is a continuous process and will provide more. But the people should also learn to be a part in maintaining cleanliness,” he said. 
 
 The general manager said that as far as creating awareness on the use bio-toilets is concerned, instructional stickers are pasted inside the toilets. “We will show demo in stations on how to use toilets,” he added. 
 
 Chief public relations officer E Vijaya said that whenever the complaints of choking of toilets are reported, the housekeeping staff attends to the issues immediately. “Stickers are also pasted on coaches asking the people not to litter the coaches,” she added. 
 
 Another senior railway official said that there was rampant choking of bio-toilets earlier. “It was around 30% earlier and now it has come down to single digit,” he said.
