HYDERABAD: Strongly condemning the Kansas incident that left Indian-American engineer   dead, a group of friends and colleagues of the deceased has floated an online petition demanding an explanation from the federal government. Titled ‘Indian Engineers target of Hate Crime’, the petition has called upon President Donald   “to state clearly and unequivocally that he denounces this incident”.

 “We would like the US Department of Justice and local law enforcement to investigate this murder as what it is, a hate crime. Anything less will be an injustice to victims and their families,” the petition reads. Apart from snuffing out a live, the horrific incident also left another Indian, Alok Madasani, critically injured.
 
 The petition, within four days of being circulated, has attracted huge attention across social media platforms with as many as 24,376 people signing it to express solidarity with the cause. It aims at garnering 1 lakh signatures by March 26 to be able to extract a response from the White House.
 
 Those familiar with the two engineers have taken the lead in sharing the petition. “This event was a hate crime and I want my country’s leadership to call it what it is. It certainly is tragic that the lone individual did these actions. His hateful words were bad, but escalating to violence just makes no sense. I don’t believe that there is data to support a claim that hate crimes have increased recently. Violent acts such as this are still rare in USA, but we want it to be zero. It is important to call this what it is to raise awareness and prevent any future occurrences as much as we possibly can,” Kurt Wagner said in an email to TOI. Wagner works with Rockwell Collins, where Kuchibhotla worked before moving to Garmin.
