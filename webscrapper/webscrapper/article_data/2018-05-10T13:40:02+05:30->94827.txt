VASCO:   residents have been spending sleepless nights after being woken up to the rattle of stones being pelted on their rooftops.

 As most of their houses have tiled roofs, anxious residents stated that stones along with broken tiles tend to rain on them many a times while they asleep.
 
 "We don't feel safe under the roof tiles. At midnight, we wake up startled by the loud noise of stones being pelted," Carmin D'Souza, a local, said. 
 
 Another local   said, "15 days ago, I visited the police station, but they asked me for a written complaint, which I later submitted. Yet, they failed to nab the accused. The police have neglected the matter."
 
 DySP Mormugao   on Wednesday visited Khariawada and inspected the area. "We will increase patrolling and nakabandi from today onwards. We will not spare the accused, " she said.
