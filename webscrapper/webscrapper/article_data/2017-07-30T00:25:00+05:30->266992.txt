Bhopal: In an attempt to evade arrest, a patwari allegedly set her dog on a Lokayukta team who had accused her of taking bribe from a farmer in Jabalpur district. 

 Officers managed to control the dog, which they said was quite aggressive. But when the officers got back their breath and initiated proceedings against her, the woman threatened to commit suicide, say sources. Seema Katare, the patwari, was later arrested on charges of demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000. 
 
 Lokayukta officials said that the complainant, Ashok Sahu, alleged that his grandfather, who had 4 acres of land near Badela nearly three decades ago, approached Katare for a map of it from the land records. But the patwari allegedly said that it had been registered in someone else’s name by mistake, and that it would cost him Rs 50,000 to correct it.
 
 According to officials, her demand was lowered to Rs 20,000. Sahu paid Rs 10,000 as the first instalment and on Thursday Rs 1,000 more. On Friday, when Sahu went to her residence with Rs 9,000, Lokayukta officials were ready and waiting. 
 
 When Sahu arrived at Katare’s home, she had kept the dog under leash. But as soon as the Lokayukta team reached, she allegedly set the dog on them. While the officers scampered for safety and then tried to control the dog, Katare allegedly tore up Sahu’s land records, say Lokayukta sources. After her alleged suicide threat, she finally surrendered and a case was registered against her under Prevention of Corruption Act.
