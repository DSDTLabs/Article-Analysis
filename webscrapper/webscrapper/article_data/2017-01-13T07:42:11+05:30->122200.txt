There were some eyebrows raised over a standee of CM Vijay Rupani which stood very obviously a few inches taller than one of   himself. The standees were outside the ‘Virtual Reality’ room of the tourism department, for people to take a virtual tour of Gujarat. What caught most viewers’ attention is that Rupani stood taller than Modi. This is nothing less than a show stopper, considering that images and cutouts of local leaders are always kept a size smaller than PM, considering his taller stature.
