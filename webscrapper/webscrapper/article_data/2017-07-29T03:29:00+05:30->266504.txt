Colva: Traditional fishermen at Colva and Benaulim netted a huge catch of prawns in the last couple of days; refrigeration trucks were parked at both the Benaulim band-stands, and as many as three trucks were loaded on Friday evening. Joao, a fisherman at the main Benaulim beach, estimates he pulled in 500kg of solar prawns, of which he sold 300kg to fish traders from Kerala, another 100kg to local fish sellers, and his wife helped sell the rest to locals who flocked at the beach and paid far lesser for bigger portions. Another fisherman said they sold a basket of solar prawns to traders at Rs 2,000, including the prized white prawns for Rs 4,000. There was a similar scene at another spot in Benaulim where fishermen made brisk business of solar prawns. Locals reaped a great deal as the prawns were selling for Rs 500 a portion till 9pm. This would normally cost nothing less than Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 at market prices.
