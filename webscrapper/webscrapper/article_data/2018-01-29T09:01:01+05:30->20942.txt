CHANDIGARH: Enter Sector 44 from the dividing road with Sector 45 and you come across a median shattered from the bulb end. The shattered concrete is scattered in all directions. The   is in the way of vehicles passing through the sector.

 The broken divider is the gift of a rash driver. The city is no short of drunken and rash drivers who crash their cars into roundabouts and medians at night. “I noticed this divider broken only a few days ago. Before that, it was absolutely intact. Some speeding vehicle must have bumped into it recently,” said passerby  , who lives in Sector 44. 
 
 The broken divider has also become an eyesore in the neighbouring locality, with people expecting the department concerned to repair it at the earliest. Many nearby residents also took a complaint to the municipal corporation about the damage. “I have seen multiple broken dividers around the city, which raises a question in my mind about the effectiveness of the traffic police in taking drunken drivers off the road at night,” said  , who had come from Sector 45. 
 
 Confronted with the question, an official in the municipal corporation said on the condition of anonymity that a repair project had started across the city and soon all the dividers will be restored.
