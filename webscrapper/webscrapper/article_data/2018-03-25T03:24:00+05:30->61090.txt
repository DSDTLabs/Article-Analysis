Panaji: The Supreme Court on Friday adjourned a writ petition filed by the National Green Tribunal ( ) bar association (Pune), challenging the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC) notification that allows a single judge bench to dispose of cases. 

 The bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Mishra, Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice D Y Chandrachud, directed on Friday that the matter be posted on Monday, March 26, to allow Attorney General of India, K K Venugopal to explain the governmentâ€™s stand.
 
 The NGT bar association has challenged the constitutional validity of NGT (Practices and Procedure) Amendment Rules, 2017 that allows even a single-member bench to perform judicial functions.
 
 The petitioners in the case have argued that it is only the expert members with knowledge of environmental law who can decide the complicated cases along with a judicial member, as has been the practice since inception of the tribunal.
 
 The affairs of the tribunal have been in a flux after Justice Swatanter Kumar retired as the chairperson of NGT on December 19, 2017.
 
 Scores of litigants from Goa who had filed complaints related to environmental matters before NGT, Pune have been affected due to shortage of manpower. 
 
 After retirement of Justice Swatanter Kumar, Justice Umesh Dattatraya Salvi moved from Pune NGT to Delhi to take up posting as acting chairperson of the tribunal. But he retired on February 13, 2018.
 
 The Pune bench is in a limbo since appointments to fill up vacancies are yet to be made.
