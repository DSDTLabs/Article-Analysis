CHANDIGARH: The   police have seized nearly 690 grams of heroin, valued at over Rs 35 lakh in the international market, from a car in Sirsa’s Gadrana village during Operation Prabal Prahar.

 A police spokesperson said heroin was seized during a patrol in the village. He said a car, with its lights on, was parked in front of a house in the village. When a crime investigation agency (CIA) team of Dabwali police reached near it, a person inside the vehicle abandoned the car and managed to escape in the dark, he added.
 
 The police recovered 690 gram heroin from a box placed under the seat, the spokesperson said, adding that primary investigation revealed that it was brought from Delhi and was to be supplied in the   area.
 
 Efforts were being made to arrest the accused identified as Govind alias Chet Singh, a resident of Gadrana village, said the cop. “The accused would soon be nabbed and action would be taken after identifying other people involved in the drug smuggling racket,” he added.
