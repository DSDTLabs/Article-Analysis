RANCHI: Five children, all girls, were rescued from Ranchi railway station on Friday afternoon. Out of the five children who have been rescued, four are between nine to 10 years of age and were being trafficked to Tripura to work in a brick kiln whereas a 13-year-old girl who had been working in Delhi was being brought back to her village by the traffickers. 

 The children were put under the protection of   after being rescued. The trafficker has been identified as one Dhaneshrar Asura and is presently under the custody of Ranchi police. 
 
 The children belong to village Ghora Patthar in the Ghagra block of Gumla district.  , member of   said, "What the children have told us so far is very shocking. They say they do not have a school in their village and that all children, whether boy or girl, are trafficked as soon as they are old enough to walk out of their mother's lap. The parents who are poverty-stricken have no option but to give up their children to the trade."
 
  Several cases of child trafficking have been reported from the region in the past and a similar incident took place a month ago when nine children from a neighbouring village were rescued and provided a similar narrative of their village to the CWC. The children are sent to large cities like Tripura and Kolkata to work and return to the village within a year with a meagre sum of Rs 2,000. The 13-year-old who has been rescued, was returning to her village empty handed.
 
 Mishra added, "From what we have come to know, even though the villagers have ration cards, they only get nominal amounts of ration which is far less than the quantity they are entitled to. The government claims the state is making great progress and that villagers are being empowered but what progress are they talking about if this is the state of our villages." 
 
 The children will be transferred to   during the weekend.
