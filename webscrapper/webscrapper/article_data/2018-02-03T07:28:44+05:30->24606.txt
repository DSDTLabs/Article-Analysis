CHENNAI: In what is declared to be the biggest seizure of foreign cigarettes smuggled through  , officials of   have seized 70.56 lakh sticks of an  , with a   popular among youth, worth 9 crore, the first such seizure in this financial year, a top official said on Friday.

 What is of greater concern is that, data accessed by TOI shows, from 2015 to 2017, seaport customs have made only three seizures. While two seizures in 2015-16 yielded 1.01 crore cigarettes, the lone recovery in 2016-17 yielded 8.4 lakh sticks. 
 
 
 
 
 In the latest seizure, a consignment of nine containers, declared gypsum powder and imported by Dindigul-based Kisan Exports was intercepted. It originated from Iran and was loaded at Jebel Ali Port in the UAE.
 
 An examination revealed 490 brown cartons concealed along with gypsum powder bags (GYPOL BRAND). The cartons contained 60 boxes of cigarettes, each with 20 packs of “GUDANG GARAM INTERNATIONAL” brand of Indonesian origin. The total consignment, worth around ?9 crore. The   packets also had statutory warnings in English and Arabic in less than 50% display area of the package, in violation of rules.
 
 The Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution Act, 2003, says cigarette packets should have health warning covering 85% of the principal display area of the package (60% pictorial warning and 25% textual health warning).
 
 Also, as per the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodity) Rules 2011, the name and address of the manufacturer/importer or packer, quantity of the product, month and year of manufacturing and retail sale price are mandatory. These were absent on the packets seized at Chennai port, the official said.
 
 Gudang Garam cigarettes, made of crushed cloves, clove oil and tobacco that gives them a unique flavour, are popular among youth in many countries. As pictorial warnings on the pack cover less than the mandatory 85% area, the smoker believes he/she is smoking cigarettes safer than Indian cigarettes, officials said.
 
 The seizure also shows that the sea routeis now preferredby smugglers after customs officials began imposing a greater vigil at Chennai international airport.
 
 Data accessed by TOI shows that the seizure of banned tobacco products at Chennai international airport jumped from 2.34 lakh sticks in 2014-15 to 29.12 lakh sticks in 2015-16 and to 53.07 lakh sticks in 2016-17. The number of seizure cases booked also correspondingly went up from 27 to 194 to 286. “Smugglers have become restless as there is a huge demand for these black cigarettes in cities, especially by young smokers, including women, who don’t want the strong odour of tobacco,” said a top source.
