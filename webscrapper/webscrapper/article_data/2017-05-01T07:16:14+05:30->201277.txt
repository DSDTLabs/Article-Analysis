MANALI: Dozens of   near 15,060ft high Kunzum, the mountain pass that connects Spiti valley with Lahaul valley, have damaged the roads in the area. Heavy   in the area has added to the poor conditions of the roadways.

 Cheif engineer, project Deepak of BRO Mohan Lal said their survey revealed that depth of snow at many places near Kunzum is about 70ft. “Kunzum area has more snow than Rohtang. Gramphoo-Kaza road has suffered many avalanches and landslides. We are pushing our machines towards Kunzum from both sides. It seems that the snow would be cleared by the end of June,” he told TOI.
 
 Given the strategic importance, Sumdo-Kaza-Gramphoo road, that passes through the Kunzum pass, was taken over by   (BRO) from   in 2011. The road remains in a bad condition with large portions covered in gravel still. Similar to Manali-Leh road, the road gets blocked by snow in winters and opens in late June or July only for four months a year. This year the region has experienced very heavy snowfall, which has triggered a large number of avalanches and landslides. Though, BRO gets special grant for snow clearance from Manali-Leh highway, no such provision for Sumdo-Kaza-Gramphoo road have been made.
 
 The Sumdo-Kaza-Gramphoo road is used for general traffic movement and tourism purpose but defence ministry has granted funds for its double-laning and the road can be used frequently by military in future. Sumdo, close to border with China, is connected with Shimla via Rampur. The 235km-long Gramphoo-Sumdo road provides additional connectivity between the existing road to Sumdo and Manali-Leh road. The rock strata of the Kunzum is very loose and keeps sliding round the year.
