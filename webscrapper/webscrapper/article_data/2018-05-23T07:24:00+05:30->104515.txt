GURUGRAM: Over 200 trees were allegedly   in and around   of the Aravalis on the border of Gurugram and   in violation of environmental norms in last two days.

 
 On Tuesday, a TOI team visited the spot, where around four acres has already been cleared. While nearly 100 trees were cut in the   buffer zone, another 100 trees felled on land protected under sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Protection Act. Any kind of non-forest activity is prohibited in the zone.
 
 RS Dhull, district forest officer, Faridabad, said the site inspection was still going on. “We received a report on alleged tree cutting and have sent a range officer to inspect the area. We will prepare a report as soon as the inspection is completed,” Dhull told TOI.
 
 Though forest department officials refused to provide any detail, TOI found that mainly dhau (anogeissus pendula) and mesquite (prosopis juliflora) were cut in the area. According local villagers, the tree felling have been going on for the past two days and so in the area. “It is still going on. Mostly, fully grown trees have been cut. It seems the motive is not only to clear the land but also to sell the logs. There is no guard at the nearby forest check posts to prevent tree felling. Also, cops are least bothered as the forest department never files police complaints,” said Sunil Hasrana, a resident of Mangar.
 
 Green activists, on the other hand, have written to the chief minister, demanding an FIR in the case. “We are sick and tired of approaching the forest department. The department simply issues a damage report and makes it a compoundable offence. Offenders go scot-free after paying a nominal penalty. However, if an FIR is longed, it will not be compoundable and the case will go to court. Thus, the forest department should file an FIR in this case so that strict and immediate action can be taken against the offenders,” said   of Save Aravalis (an NGO).
