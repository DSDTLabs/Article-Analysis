BHOPAL: City buses run by Bhopal City Link limited (BCLL) advertising   products, is yet to   with the civic body and district administration. 

 “I am not aware of the situation. I would have to look into it,” said district collector Nishant Warwade at a press conference to promote an anti-tobacco campaign. Warwade has been instrumental in promoting organ donation and other health initiatives in the city. 
 
 BCLL has appointed a private company to lease out advertisement space on buses as well as at bus stops. A representative of Rajdeep Advertisement said, “We are not aware of the rules. We just lease out the spaces. It is up to the agency to abide by the rules and regulations.” 
 
 Going by the Madhya Pradesh Outdoor Advertisement Media Rules 2016, ‘advertisements promoting drugs, alcohol, cigarette or tobacco items’ are not permitted. ‘No advertisements or outdoor media device (including buses) can promote such advertisement. Moreover, the buses promoting the tobacco products, do not have a very visible disclaimer. 
 
 Furthermore, enforcement of Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COPTA) has been less than reassuring in the state capital. Various pan shops have been reported to be violating the rules. COPTA forbids the sale and advertisement of tobacco and tobacco products. 
 
 There are about 200 BCLL buses that ply in the city. BCLL is a Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) subsidiary. 
 
 “If you ask me, all these products (tobacco, gutka and supari) are harmful to one’s health,” Warwade asserted, calling for citizen support to help curb the public health problem. “If one is seen smoking, mostly people object. However, people sit at an office desk chewing gutka and seldom anyone objects,” he added.
 
 Citizen’s support is vital to spread awareness about tobacco and its harmful effects, he added.
