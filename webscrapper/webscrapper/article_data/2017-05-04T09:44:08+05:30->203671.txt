JAMSHEDPUR: Bihar chief minister   has agreed to support the campaign against the   government’s decision to amend the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) and Santhal Pargana Tenancy (SPT) Act.

 As part of the understanding reached between Kumar and tribal social outfit Adivasi   (ASA), the   will “extend his support” to the movement against chief minister   on the issue while the ASA will do ground work in tribal-dominated districts of Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to establish him as an alternative prime ministerial face ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
 
 To begin with, Kumar is likely to participate at a rally organised by the ASA in Ranchi on May 17. The ASA said it will devise a strategy for more such public meetings across the state.
 
 “After the May 17 event, a joint strategy will be worked out with an aim to reach out to the tribal people in the five states for holding political programmes ahead of the 2019 polls,” ASA convenor Salkhan Murmu said at a press conference here on Wednesday.
 
 Murmu said that the ban on sale and consumption of liquor, women empowerment — including reservation for women in the panchayat bodies — and good governance will be in the core of the agenda for presenting Kumar as the alternative face for the PM’s post in the Scheduled Tribe Lok Sabha seats in the five eastern states.
 
 Sharing the details of the meeting between Kumar and an ASA delegation on April 1 in Patna, the former MP — and the founder and national president of Jharkhand Disom Party — said Kumar has opposed the amendment made to the tenancy laws. “We will welcome JD(U) if it joins us in furthering our cause in Jharkhand,” said Murmu.
