PUNE: Citizens deposited over 7,800kg of plastic and e-waste in a special drive carried out by the   (PMC) on Sunday, following the state government’s decision to ban plastic. 

 The PMC has put up over 200 centres, including 15 ward offices and over 190 Arogya Kothis (storerooms of the health department), in the city to collect the banned plastic items. 
 
 The drive was conducted between 9am and 11am on Sunday and 5,880kg of plastic, 1,758kg of thermocol and 179kg of e-waste were collected. 
 
 Mayor   said, “The citizens should come up with options for plastic. The civic body will consider these environment friendly alternatives.”
 
 Saurabh Rao, the PMC commissioner, said, “More and more disposal units will be established across the city. The civic administration is taking efforts in that direction.” 
 
 The state government imposed the plastic ban on March 23. It has prohibited the manufacture, usage, sale, transport, handling and storage of many plastic and thermocol products, including bags, dishes, cups, glasses, bowls, forks, spoons, straws, containers, small PET bottles and decoration items. 
 
 Since the beginning of the ban, the PMC confiscated 50 tonnes of plastic material, including bags and thermocol. 
 
 The PMC has planned to reuse the material to make bricks. 
 
 The PMC collects 1,600 tonnes of dry and wet garbage everyday and nearly 12% of the total garbage generated in the city consists of plastic.
