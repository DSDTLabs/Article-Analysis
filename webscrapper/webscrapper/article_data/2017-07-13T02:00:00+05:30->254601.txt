PATNA: The ten-bed Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre (NRC) at the Patna Medical College and Hospital ( ), which was inaugurated on June 23, has started getting patients.

 The NRC started a counselling session on Wednesday where mothers were trained in hygiene standards and preparation of cost-effective nutritious diet.
 
 Meant for treatment and rehabilitation of ‘severe acute malnutrition (SAM)’-affected children, the NRC’s first three patients include a 10-month-old boy and two girls aged eight months and two years. Two of the patients are from Saran and Vaishali districts, but were admitted in the Patna district’s NRC as they were referred by PMCH. 
 
 The 10-month-old boy from Chhapra in Saran was hospitalised following a bout of measles. When discharged from PMCH, he was found to be severely undernourished.
 
 The eight-month-old girl hailing from Salimpur village in Patna district would throw out food after consumption while the two year-old girl from Vaishali district was admitted in PMCH following severe diarrhoea. 
 
 All these children were referred to the NRC following an “anthropometric assessment”, which declared them SAM according to the World Health Organization standards. 
 
 According to sources, this is the country’s second NRC to be housed in a hospital after New Delhi’s Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital. The National Rural Health Mission and UNICEF supported the Bihar government to establish the district’s only NRC. 
 
 Such an NRC for Patna district was earlier located on the outskirts of the state capital, but had become defunct as it did not get patients.
