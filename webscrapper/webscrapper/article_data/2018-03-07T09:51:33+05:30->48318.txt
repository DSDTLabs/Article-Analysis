KOTTAYAM: With the CPM not willing to take any chance in the backdrop of the   debacle, it has been decided that the party should rope in Kerala Congress (M) to prevent a BJP victory in the  .

 
 With just 10,198 votes separating the winning CPM candidate   and the BJP candidate in the previous election, CPM knows very well that BJP’s P S Sreedharan Pillai cannot be taken lightly.
 
 
 LDF convenor   has already hinted that the LDF was expecting KC (M) support in the bypolls. “The KC(M) is not part of the UDF. So, naturally, parties which are against the UDF and BJP should support us,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the high power committee meeting of the KC(M) to be held here on March 18 is expected to take a decision on its stand in the bypoll. Party chief K M Mani’s name being recently cleared in the bar bribery case and CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s statement that the entry of Mani into the LDF will be discussed with all allies are likely to influence the decision.
 
 Congress, meanwhile, is hoping that KC(M) will take a stand similar to that it took during the Vengara bypoll. Muslim League leaders are also learnt to be in constant touch with Mani in this regard.
 
 However, the stand taken by NSS will be crucial in the election. Though Sreedharan Pillai is known to be NSS supremo Sukumaran Nair’s blue-eyed boy, Nair would be forced to play a balancing act due to the recent good relation developed with the CPM. The state government move to provide 10% reservation for economically backward people among the majority communities in devaswom board recruitments had moved the NSS closer to CPM.
 
 Moreover, the NSS is not happy with the NDA government not implementing the Sinhu Commission report. The panel was appointed by the UPA government in 2006 to study the condition of the economically backward among the forward communities.
 
 It will be left to see how the BJP think tanks and mediators can influence the NSS leadership.
