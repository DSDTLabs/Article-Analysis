HYDERABAD: Officials executing works on laying drinking water pipelines for   are racing against time to avoid monsoon blues.

 About 30,000 km length of pipelines have to be laid through private  . Officials want these works to be completed before the onset of monsoon as farmers will start sowing operations with the arrival of the rains. The agriculture operations for kharif will start in June.
 
 While claiming that 70% of the 30,000 km   were completed last year, sources said the contrac tors and field officials have been instructed that “laxity will not be tolerated“ and that pipeline works through agricultural fields must be completed by June. “If the pipeline is not laid through agricultural fields before June, these works will have to wait until October-November after the kharif season comes to end.Once pipelines are laid underground, farmers can carry on with their agricultural operations even over the pipeline area,“ said a senior official.
 
 Also, the officials want to complete construction of a majority of   (OHSRs) before the arrival of the monsoon.Of the 17,000 OHSRs planned, the government wants to complete construction of at least 4,000 OHSRs in villages before the monsoon hits the villages.
 
 Chief minister   has asked officials and contractors to hire skilled masons from other states as those from Telangana are not enough to take up so many works.
 
 Rural water supply chief engineer (Mission Bhagiratha), Vijay Paul Reddy , said they need skilled masons for construction of OHSRs. “Unlike other civil works like construction of buildings, OHSRs will hold water. Those who have good experience of having constructed OHSRs earlier would be hired from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh,“ he said.
