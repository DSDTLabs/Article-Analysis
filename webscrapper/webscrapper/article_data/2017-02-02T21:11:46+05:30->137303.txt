MUMBAI: The India U-19 team will look to go one up when they face England in the third of the five-match ODI series at the   here on Sunday.
 
 Thanks to a wonderful all-round performance, India had levelled the series with a thumping 129-run victory in the second ODI on Wednesday. They had lost the first ODI by 23 runs despite a century by  .
  
 India had made six changes to the line-up for the second game and are likely to make a few changes in the third ODI too. Coach and India legend   said on Wednesday that results at this stage don’t really matter.
  
 “We want to give everyone a chance. This age group should not focus on the results, but on learning. That’s why it’s important that everyone in the squad is able to play a match. I don’t really care about the results,” he had said.
  
 England, on the other hand, seem to be just getting acclamatised with the conditions. While a Delray Rawlins century saw them through in the first ODI at Wankhede, they couldn’t read the pace and bounce in the second ODI. Their bowlers too struggled to bowl in the right areas. 
 
 They real test though, is the food, as their skipper Matt Fisher told TOI. They have a solution for it though — pizza.
  
 “We’ve just been gorging on pizza really,” he said with a laugh, adding, “It’s the first time most of the guys are travelling here. We want to concentrate on our cricket, but at the same time don’t want to eat anything our stomach doesn’t agree to, especially the spicy stuff. Pizza is the best option in that sense. We’ve eaten so much that the guys at the pizza place give us a 50 % discount,” he joked.
  
 Hope they’ve had their fill, for if the second ODI was anything to go by, the Indian colts will be hungry for more.
