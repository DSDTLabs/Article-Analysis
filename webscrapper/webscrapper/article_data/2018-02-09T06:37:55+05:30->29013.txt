AHMEDABAD: Despite the ongoing festive season, silver imports in Gujarat plunged to a 14-month low in January. According to data provided by  , silver imports in Gujarat stood at 0.17 metric tonne in January, declining by 58.53% against January 2017. The last time silver imports were significantly low was in November 2016 at 0.06 metric tonne. Analysts claim that investors have refrained from investing in silver for the past few months as there is no significant change in the prices.

 At the same time, industry stakeholders have avoided investments and even bullion purchases in January particularly in hope of a duty-cut. “The industry expected a cut in the basic customs duty on gold and silver which stands at 10% currently and therefore, investors at large had their eyes on the budget before making any investments,” said Haresh Acharya, secretary, National Bullion Federation.
 
 Silver prices settled at Rs 38,900 per kilogram on Thursday. The prices have not witnessed significant changes in the past couple of months, indicate investors. 
 
 Silver imports have not significantly increased after October 2017 (26MT), which witnessed hefty festive and muhurat purchases of silver and stood at 0.36 MT and 0.71 MT respectively in November and December 2017. Analysts feel that investors have been refraining from investments primarily backed on low prices.
 
 Explaining this, Surendra Mehta, secretary,   (IBJA), said, “Silver holdings have been significantly low of late, as investors do not get significant returns. Silver prices have settled around Rs 38,000 per kg mark for the past three months and there has been hardly any movement.”
 
 Industry estimates indicate that 25% of silver consumption is for industrial applications. “Industry procurement is always dictated by prices and whenever the prices plunge, industries tend to procure silver as it comes cheaper,” Mehta added.
