BEIJING: The   stand-off happened due to lack of mutual trust between India and China and PM   and President   will try to bridge the deficit through “heart-to-heart” discussions in   later this week, Chinese vice foreign minister   said. The stand-off “reflected the somewhat lack of mutual trust between the two countries”, Kong said.

 
 The purpose of talks is to avoid a situation similar to the 73-day stand-off, which has seriously affected the relationship across the  . “At the informal summit, the two leaders will have heart-to-heart discussions on overarching issues and try to build mutual trust and consensus to resolve outstanding differences,” Kong said. “The two countries need to create conditions and trust between them to resolve the boundary issue,” he further said.
 
 Indian official sources said the two leaders will have several one-on-one meetings with just their translators present over two days. There may be just one or two delegation-level meetings between officials of the two sides.
 
 The idea is to stay away from the influence of structured exchanges and to look at issues from a more political viewpoint.
 
 They might also exchange notes about their experience in meeting leaders of other countries including US President Trump and the Pakistani leadership for a more comprehensive understanding of thorny issues, sources said.
 
 Even after the meeting, the two leaders will “stay in touch through various channels”.
 
 There will be no formal communique issued at the end of the meeting because the purpose is to understand each other’s point of view on issues, he said.
