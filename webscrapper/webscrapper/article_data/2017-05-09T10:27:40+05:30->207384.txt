NEW DELHI: The   to make Connaught Place vehicle-free, which was due to be launched in February, continues to remain in a limbo as   (NDMC) is yet to prepare the action plan. Due to objections from the stakeholders and delay in preparing the plan, there is no deadline for the project in the near future.

 NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar said   was yet to submit the traffic plan without which the project could not be implemented. “The traffic police is yet to tell us about the steps it needs to take to ensure there are no disruptions. Only after taking a look at their plan, we can finalise ours,” said Kumar.
 
 The council was supposed to procure battery-powered vehicles, however, nothing has happened in that regard too. Kumar said NDMC needs to seek approval from   (ARAI) before plying such vehicles. “We are trying to hold a meeting with ARAI to get their approval,” he said.
 
 Sources said the objection raised by the traders was a major reason for the delay. They had even held demonstrations in February against the move and submitted a memorandum to NDMC to scrap the project. However, the council’s stand on the issue still remains unclear.
 
 The project, aimed at making the inner and middle circle vehicle-free, would also include dismantling of surface parking lots.
