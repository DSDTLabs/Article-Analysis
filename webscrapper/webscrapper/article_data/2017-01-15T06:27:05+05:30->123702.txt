AMRITSAR: After a public show of resentment against former chief of Shiromani Akali Dal’s Amritsar (urban) unit chief Upkar Singh Sandhu by   (AAP) volunteers, party’s state convener   finally welcomed him into the party fold here on Saturday.

 Talking to newspersons, Warich said Sandhu was concerned about Punjab’s welfare and had resigned from SAD following ruling government’s failure to nab culprits of incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib.
 
 Sandhu, who had joined the   after resigning from SAD, said, “Joining the Congress was a big mistake and I felt suffocated there.” He claimed that during his entire political career, he had followed the ideology that matched with that of AAP.
