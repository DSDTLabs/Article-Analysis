Bengaluru:   called the shots in his opening-round clash of the   event against Bosnia’s  , ranked 75. The 25-year-old, ranked 107, came through 7-5, 6-3in 1 hour and 33 minutes, to set up a second -ound meeting with the world No.11 American  .

 
 
 
 Bhambri, who came through the qualifiers of Masters 1000 events in the second successive competition of that level, hadn’t played his 26-yearold opponent before. “I served well and won crucial points in the first set, I put pressure on him,” Bhambri said.
 
 
 Basic, who was the second seed in the qualifying competition, fell in the final hurdle, but made the main draw as a lucky loser. “It can be tricky playing a lucky loser because he has nothing to lose. He has already lost in the qualifiers but gets to play in the main draw, so they come out swinging,” Bhambri said.
 
 
 Bhambri, who sent down 68 per cent of first serves to his opponent’s tally of 57, won 71 per cent of points on his second serve, which turned out to be the clincher. Basic won just six points on the Indian’s second serve.
 
 
 “I’m happy that I was able to refocus after a good week in Indian Wells. To come back and play the qualifiers which again is a really tough field, it’s not like it’s a cakewalk, I did good,” the Indian said.
 
 
 In the final round of the qualifiers earlier in the week, Bhambri beat ATP Next Gen star 21-year-old Elias Ymer of Sweden, ranked 133.
 
 
 “Once you’re on the Tour, it doesn’t matter who you’re playing or if you’re 18 or 38, you go out there and compete the hardest you can. Once you’re at that level, you are ready. He’s a really good player already,” Bhambri, a former junior world No.1, said, shrugging off the question on whether he was under pressure playing Ymer. Bhambri called Saturday’s match-up against Sock a challenge.
