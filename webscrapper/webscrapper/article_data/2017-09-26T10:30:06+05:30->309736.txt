NEW DELHI: Congress has hit back at BJP president  , with party chief spokesperson   saying instead of being “rattled and obsessed with Rahul Gandhi”, he and his party should answer some hard questions.
 
  Surjewala asked: “Where are the 2-crore   promised by BJP? How many new jobs have been added in last 3.5 years? Why is   floundering? Why did BJP inflict the biggest scam of   on us? Who is responsible for shoddy implementation of GST?”
  
  He asked: “Why is BJP government burning holes in the pockets of common people by profiteering from petrol and diesel prices?” He asked: “Will Shah ever say a word on Vyapam, Modigate, GSPC...”
