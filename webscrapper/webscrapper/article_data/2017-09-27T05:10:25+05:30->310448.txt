ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ousted Prime Minister   appeared before the accountability court on Tuesday to respond to the Panamagate corruption charges filed against him and his children by the country's anti-graft body   (NAB).

 The court announced that Sharif will be formally indicted on October 2. The court also issued bailable arrest warrants against Sharif his sons, Hassan and Hussain, daughter   and her husband   for their failure to appear for it on September 19.
 
 Sharif was accompanied by senior party leaders, federal ministers and supporters. “I had left the country in emergency due to my wife's ailment and my inner circle knew that I would return as fleeing from the courts is not our way.“ he said.
 
 Sharif also alleged that the charges of wrongdoing against him were fabricated.
 
 “We did not commit any cor ruption. If this was about Pa nama Papers, then why was I disqualified for holding an iqama (foreign working per mit)?“ he asked.
 
 Questioning the grounds of his disqualification by the country's SC, Sharif said, “They were determined to disqualify me; that is why they took up the issue of the undeclared asset after failing to prove any corruption. Let the de cision of qualification and disqualification rest with the people.“
 
 He alleged that the judges constituted a joint investigation team after they failed to find any proof of his wrongdoing.
 
 “It was strange that the same court then took control of NAB. And if required, this same court will listen to my last appeal as well,“ Shairf sa id. “This is the first case in the country's history where the whole force of the law has been applied by the petitioner, and the defence has been denied all constitutional and human rights,“ he added.
