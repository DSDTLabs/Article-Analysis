MUMBAI: The BMC's   is unlikely to bother a   which for over a year now has been separating and treating its garbage within its premises. The 13-storey  , with 28 flats, started the practice last March.

 “The real support for such work comes from residents, and we are proud to have the help of all our society members,“ said Sonal Shah, a resident.
 
 The society has a designated  , where two large compost bins have been placed. In each, around 35kg of waste is put and within a period of approximately 25 days, compost gets made, which is then used for the society garden. As each bin costs around Rs 80,000, the builder procured them for the society initially.The compost bins take all kinds of food waste, cooked and uncooked.
 
 When TOI visited the society, Shah, who is also chairperson of Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (MCHI), CREDAI women's wing, was seen explaining to neighboring schoolchildren the importance of segregating waste. Many questions were seen coming from the children on what all they should be doing to segregate waste.
 
 The BMC has said it will set a new deadline for housing societies and establishments that have not implemented segregation. An official said the civic body is firm that after this deadline, it will stop collecting wet waste from bodies that don't comply with the rule and will even initiate action against them. He said small societies are not being targeted, and the rule is for big societies, which have enough space to set up segregation and wet waste processing units.
