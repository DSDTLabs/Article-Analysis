LUDHIANA: Dehlon police, on Sunday, claimed to have busted a gang of liquor thieves, with the arrest of three. 

 The trio has been identified as   of Ferozepur,   and Manpreet Singh, both residents of Gopalpur in Dehlon. The gang kingpin, Judge Singh, a resident of Giaspura, has already been arrested by   police. Police said on March 10, the gang had struck at a liquor vend in Lehra village and made off with 301 bottles of liquor in a car. Before striking, one of the gang members had conducted a reconnaissance. 
 
 On Sunday, police received a tip-off that the three were at Rurka village on   road. 
 
 Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Jasvir Singh said, "Pawan, Manpreet and Shamsher were arrested from the village. The mastermind of the gang, Judge Singh, was arrested by Barnala police in a similar case some days ago. We have recovered the car they used in the crime. It seems to be a stolen vehicle as it is not registered on their names. 
 
 The gang is involved in two to three such cases. Shamsher Singh and Manpreet are addicts. This was the first liquor theft committed by Pawan." Following a theft in Barnala and Lehra, Judge Singh had given some liquor boxes to the three. Those were meant for consumption and further sale, the ASI added. Besides the car, police have seized 10 boxes of liquor and a knife from their possession.
