 The project was taken up after a study by the   in 2013 suggested that the traffic on the road was expected to rise by 100 percent in the coming years. The report had also suggested that a flyover should be constructed on the stretch to handle the traffic.
 
 In December 2016, the   had decided to get the flyover constructed by the roads and buildings department of the state government. But it later decided that both the options of the VMC or the roads and buildings department of the state government should be considered.

 VMC officials said that as per the recent guidelines, the design of the flyover has been sent to the state roads and buildings department for its approval. The approval is expected to arrive soon following which the work will begin. The civic body has set a deadline of 36 months for the completion of the project.
 
 A unique feature of the flyover will be that it will have lots of greenery on it as compared to other similar structures. Apart from plantations on the side of the structure, vertical gardens have been planned on the flyover.
 
 Preparation for the project has already begun on site at the Genda Circle. “The moment the design is cleared, work will begin,” said an official.
