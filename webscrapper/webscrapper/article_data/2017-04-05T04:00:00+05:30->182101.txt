Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is aggressively pursuing with the state government for allotment of a piece of land at Haripura village on the outskirts of the city to it for building a logistic park. This plot of land which measures around 3 lakh square meter was earlier allotted to a private group by the state government. As the group had not paid the due amount to the state government, SMC has requested the authorities concerned to give the land to it for the development of the logistic park. Another reason why SMC is keen on the project is ministry of road transport and highways, Government of India’s promise to fund the logistic park which will ease traffic congestion in the city.

 It is estimated that over 5,000 big and small transport vehicles enter and exit the city daily. SMC aims at keeping transport vehicles parked outside the city limits and a logistic park is a great concept towards realizing it. It decided to set up a logistic park under Smart City mission of the central government alongside the National Highway 8. The ministry of road transport and highways has made budgetary provisions of Rs 2,41,384 crore for the year 2017-18 and a major chunk would go towards development of logistic parks and multi-model transport hubs in industrial cities. 
 
 “This logistic park would benefit the city immensely. A major chunk of money for the project would come from the central government,” a SMC official said.
 
 Mansukh Mandaviya, Union minister of state for road transport and highways, told TOI, “I have called for this proposal from the municipal commissioner of Surat. We want a multi-model logistic park at such a place that it can be useful to people.”
 
 Jivan Patel, director of planning, SMC, said: “We recently submitted our proposal to the state government.”
