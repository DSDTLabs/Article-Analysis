He said that department had conducted the inspection on March 5, 2015, and during inspection it was found that current from tower 103 was flowing into some nearby fields in   while from tower 107 current was flowing into the surroundings of Beli Ramâ€™s house. He said in rest of villages no flow of current was detected.
