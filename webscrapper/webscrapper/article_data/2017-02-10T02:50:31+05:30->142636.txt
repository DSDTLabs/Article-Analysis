NEW DELHI: With   going into recess, the Congress-led opposition has begun to coordinate efforts to boycott the Prime Minister during the remainder of the   resuming on March 9, demanding that Modi "introspect and express regret" for his "raincoat" barb on  . 

  Deputy leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, told reporters, "The last chapter of the story scripted by the PM will be written by the opposition." 
 
 Congress, TMC, SP, JDU, DMK and Left parties held a meeting on Thursday to chalk out strategy and are likely to consult again in the inter-session period.
 
  While it was the last day of the pre-recess session, the parties appear eager to carry on their protest in the second half. In what sounded ominous for the government, Sharma said   will adopt a uniform stance for both Houses. 
 
  However, the trajectory of the March session will be dictated by the outcome of the ongoing elections to five states on March 11, just two days after Parliament reconvenes. 
 
  A victory for the ruling camp would automatically temper the mood in the opposition, which includes UP players like SP, BSP and Congress, but a defeat for BJP is likely to see the anti-saffron bloc go for the Modi regime's jugular. 
 
 Stating "there could be no dialogue with the PM", Sharma said, "We will boycott Modi in this session with the request that he introspect and express regret. We are not asking him to apologise because we know that he is an arrogant man."
