 "Matthew's going around, pops the champagne. It's a party! He motorboats me - is that what it's called? We're all dancing. He comes up to me like, 'Oh Kay baby!' pours champagne and puts it up to my lips. And I feel a camera next to me and I smell, and I'm like, 'Is this alcohol?' I've gone 35 years without a sip, so I'm like 'Mmm.'," Howard said.
