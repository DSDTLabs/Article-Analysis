With her latest film is earning box office numbers and winning hearts of many,   actress   said that she will gear up for her next film soon instead of taking another break.

 Holding her next move on films was based on the response of the audience, Rani, asked about how she will take the success of her latest flick, said: "Yes, I told everyone that my next film will be depending on the audience response.

 "I will be doing more films because that is something I always love doing. But there was a gap for four years because of my marriage and baby. I wanted to see if the audience would be interested to see me onscreen. Now that I know, people are more than happy to see me onscreen, even I am ready. There are projects that I kept on hold" said Rani who played the lead role of a teacher in the film.
 
 She was present along with the director   and creative producer   at a media meet here on Thursday to celebrate the film's success.
 
 The actress started shooting for the film when her daughter Adira was just 14 months old. Asked about how she finds the balance between motherhood and work, Rani said: "Well, she (her daughter) was of that age when babies take their first step. 
 
 "One day I came back from shooting and she took her first step. I do not want to miss out on any of her milestones, and taking the first step was surely one of them. I was nervous that what if I am shooting and she takes her first step?
 
 "Mow she started understanding, especially during the promotion of the film that I go to work. So when I go back home, she says, 'Mumma please remove your make-up'. She does not like my makeup, just like her father. So that way, the DNA is working absolutely fine."
