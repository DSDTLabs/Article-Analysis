PUNE: The   for the proposed airport at Purandar would be submitted only after the Zilla Parishad, Panchayat Samiti and municipal corporation polls.

 The Pune district collector was supposed to table it early last week. But with the election code of conduct coming into force on January 11, collector Saurabh Rao will present the rehabilitation plan after “further extensive studies” after the completion of the election process, once the results are declared on February 23. 
 
 A meeting in this regard was held between the Pune collector and officials from the   late on Friday, where the decision was taken. It was also decided to bring out a “hybrid” package after studying all the existing models.
 
 “Our local studies were conducted and enough data was gathered. However, it would not be appropriate to submit the same at this time and we would do so post the elections. In effect, we got more time to study the rehabilitation model in greater detail,” the collector told TOI on Saturday.
 
 So far, the collector and other revenue officials had assessed the Amravati, Navi Mumbai, Samruddhi and Cochin models of model of land acquisition.
 
 Data pertaining to sale and purchase of the target land in the last five years, the ready reckoner prices in the area, the yield generated per acre and income from the yield, identification of rain-fed lands and irrigated lands are all part of the studies which will be conducted.
 
 The revenue department said that they have also updated the records of the villages, and that the areas would be demarcated only after the completion of the Ground level Obstacle Survey, which should be completed in a week’s time. Once the area is demarcated, with details of the village and survey numbers, another study would be conducted on the people and areas which would be affected and otherwise.
