Amritsar: In the wake of the current Army crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, minority communities of Pakistan, including Hindus and Sikhs, staged a demonstration in Karachi and urged Pope Francis to intervene and use his influence to stop the mass exodus of the beleaguered community.

 “Hundred and thousands of Sikhs and Hindus are ready to go to Bangladesh to help Rohingyas, who are fleeing their country but we are not being given visas, so we staged a demonstration to attract international attention,” a prominent Sikh leader of Pakistan, advocate Hira Singh, told TOI over phone from Karachi on Saturday. Hira, who is the president of Karachi-based Sri Guru Nanak Satsang Sabha, said they had sought appointment from Pope Francis so that they could meet him and urge him to extend a helping hand to the Rohingyas, who were being persecuted in Myanmar. “All human beings are created by Waheguru and genocide in any part of world is not acceptable. It is against the Sikh philosophy,” he maintained.
 
 He further said that there might be political differences but there were always some ways and means to resolve those but killing of minorities was not a solution. “It may create problems for other minorities living in Islamic states,” he said.
 
 Hira stated that a minority community leader delegation would be visiting Rome to meet the Pope and request him to intervene and issue an appeal to the Myanmar government to stop killing of Rohingya Muslims. “We have also appealed to the UN to find a political solution to Rohingya catastrophe,” said Hira.
 
 Stressing on the need to exert international pressure on the Myanmar government to stop persecution of Rohingyas, he said that Bangladesh alone couldn’t deal with the current crisis as it was already one of world’s most densely populated countries. “We are waiting a response from the Vatican City,” he added.
