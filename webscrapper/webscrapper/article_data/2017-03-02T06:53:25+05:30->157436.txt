THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   is unlikely to undergo changes in the budget as the government expects   regime by July. The   will be a major source of income in the coming fiscal and there are chances of   schemes being announced.

 â€œThe state's VAT revenue will grow by more than 20% after GST is implemented. Growth in VAT revenue was four per cent this January,'' said finance minister Thomas Isaac.
 
 Isaac said that the traders are sceptical about the GST since they fear that both the centre and state governments would tax them more. They are also concerned over the way a new tax regime will be implemented in the middle of a financial year. Their concerns are something that cannot be wished away.
 
 But it is also a fact that the tax revenue which was growing by 20% suddenly came down to 12%, which is purely due to tax drain. To fix the tax drain several measures were taken and this resulted in legal tussles. Hence, for finding an amicable solution there is a popular feeling that amnesty schemes would be helpful, said Isaac.
 
 He said that over Rs 7,000 crore tax dues are now entangled in legal issues. The original amount will come around Rs 2,500 crore and the rest is penalty. An amnesty for general sales tax announced ten years ago had fetched Rs 500 crore. Hence the finance minister expects the proposed scheme to mobilise thrice this amount.
 
 Isaac is also sure that the state will witness a record revenue deficit during the next fiscal as a result of demonetisation. But the budget will have huge payouts, including arrears of pension and salary commitments and their accumulated interest. But there will not be any cuts in welfare spending.
