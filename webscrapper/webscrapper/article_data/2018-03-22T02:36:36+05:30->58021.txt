NEW DELHI:   has decided to rope in   to increase the numbers of properties falling under the tax net from the next financial year. A proposal was cleared by the standing committee on Wednesday wherein RWAs registered with Delhi government and with a valid registration number will play the role of   collection agents.

 “The civic agency will soon invite RWAs to organise tax   camps, educate residents and urge people to pay their pending property tax. In return, they will get 3% of the total collections,” a senior official from the finance department told TOI. However, the commission can only be utilised by RWAs for the welfare of the colony or area.
 
 Only around 4.4 lakh people actually pay property tax in the densely-populated areas falling under the civic body’s jurisdiction. The primary reasons for the poor collection are acute shortage of field staff and reluctance of residents to pay the taxes.
 
 The civic body also cleared the property tax amnesty scheme for financial year 2017-18 extending the benefit of waiver of 100% interest and penalty on outstanding tax to all areas. Mayor Preety Agarwal said, “This waiver was earlier available to only unauthorised colonies. The last date to avail this waiver is March 31. All property tax offices will remain open on all Saturdays of March between 10am and 5pm.”
