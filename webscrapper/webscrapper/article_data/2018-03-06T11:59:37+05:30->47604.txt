 The book is said to examine the complete breadth of Parekh's career, from the 1960s to the present time. Over 250 of his works are included in the book, representing every important aspect of his oeuvre. 
 
 Manu Parekh is one of India's most inventive painters. His early work explored the relationship between man and nature, which according to him was an energetic link that had to be celebrated. 
 
 His paintings provoke viewers to take notice of the world around them through the emotion, pain and anguish expressed in the subjects of his paintings. His colours and forms exude a volatile energy that can barely be contained within the confines of the canvas, and become an extension of his personality.
