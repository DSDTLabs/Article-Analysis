 Says dermatologist Dr  , “To begin with, take a tub of lukewarm water and add marbles to it, along with ingredients like Epsom salt, two vitamin E tablets and several drops of your favourite essential oil.”
 
  Next put your feet in and relax for sometime. Soak your feet completely, rolling your soles back and forth over the marbles. The marbles will relieve and relax your feet muscles. Remove your feet, dry them thoroughly and follow it up with a good moisturiser. To keep your feet warm, wear a pair of socks before you go to bed.
