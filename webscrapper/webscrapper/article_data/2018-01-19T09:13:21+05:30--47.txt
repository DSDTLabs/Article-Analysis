AJMER: If the   comes to power in the state,   will be scrapped, declared Congress candidate   on Thursday.

 Sharma, who is contesting from the Ajmer Lok Sabha bypoll seat, said these cards, issued by the state government, has been of no use for people living in rural areas. He was addressing a gathering at Pinglod village of Roopangarh.
 
 Sharma’s statement came as a surprise to even Congress supporters as the Bhamashah scheme, an initiative by chief minister Vasundhra Raje, is aimed at providing free treatment and medical facilities for the poor.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sharma said that there was not a single villager who has not complaint about the card and called it useless. “They have been asked to produce and fill various papers as proof by banks. And finally they do not even get their pension when their thumb impressions do not match,” said Sharma.
 
 He also criticized the presence of CM Raje’s photo on the Bhamashah card and said it was a violation of election code of conduct. “We have asked the Election Commissioner to prevent the use of these cards during polls which is a violation of the code of conduct,” added Sharma.
 
 District rural Congress president Bhupender Singh Rathore too alleged that the card was being misused for publicity by Raje and did not serve any useful purpose for villagers.
 
 Sharma campaigned in Roopangarh and Kishangarh region of the district on Thursday. For the first time, Congress chief Sachin Pilot did not accompany him during the campaign as he had already left for Alwar.
