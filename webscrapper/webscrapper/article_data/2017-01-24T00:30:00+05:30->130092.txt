 and meteorology clearly have, what can at best be described as a cosmic relationship. While the ‘Butterfly Effect’, a phenomenon in   is often used to explain the inherent complexity of weather systems, researchers at the city-based Environmental Management and Policy Research Institute (EMPRI) say that butterflies are the best bio-indicators of  .

 A baseline survey of butterflies in Bengaluru conducted over the past one year revealed that the number of butterfly species in the city had come down to 108, against 140 in 1990 and 153 in 1933. An autonomous body under the department of forest, ecology and environment, EMPRI has been conducting research on climate change.
 
 Researchers at the institute told TOI that butterflies, with a lifespan ranging from 15 to 30 days, are acutely sensitive to changes in the environment. “From an air conditioned city, Bengaluru has turned into a city with heat islands. Our baseline survey can go a long way in finding how climate change adversely impacts plant diversity, phenology and the diversity of insects, which subsist on the plants,” said OK Remadevi of EMPRI’s Centre for Climate Change.
 
 Common Grass Yellow: Bengaluru butterfly
 
 The study, titled ‘Butterflies as bio-indicators of climate change – A baseline study in Bengaluru City’, found that of the 108 butterfly species in the city, 10 fall under the protection category of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972, while 19 were classified as very common, 37 categorised common, 21 rare and 31 very rare.
 
 “Common grass yellow (Eurema Hecabe) is the most abundantly found species in the city. In fact, we can call it Bengaluru butterfly. We also managed to record 22   in our study that had not been documented earlier,” Remadevi added.
 
 The study was undertaken in six green areas in the city: Lalbagh, Cubbon Park, Bannerghatta National Park, GKVK Campus, IISc campus and Doresanipalya Forest.
 
 79 species found at GKVK campus
 
 The study found that the GKVK campus is home to as many as 79 species, the most in the city, while the Doresanipalya Forest campus in JP Nagar came a close second, with 78 species being documented there.
 
 “As part of the study, 30 transects of 500m were laid out in all the six areas where the study was undertaken. Data was collected on a fortnightly basis between 8am and 2pm. The survey was carried out in the six locations in different seasons,” read the EMPRI’s study report.
 
 Apart from researchers Roshan D Puranik, Sooraj S, Vinay Kumar KH, Saswati Mishra, EMPRI director general Ritu Kakkar was also involved in the survey.

  GKVK Campus: 79; IISc Campus: 58; Cubbon Park: 50; Lalbagh: 64; Doresanipalya Forest, JP Nagar: 78; Bannerghatta National Park: 69
 
 *Breakdown of butterfly species with respect to families
 
 Lycaenidae: 34; Nymphalidae: 29; Pieridae: 20; Hesperiidae: 14; Papilionidae: 10; Riodinidae: 1
 
 *Maximum number of butterfly species recorded during the rainy season followed by summer and winter
 
 *Study forms the baseline data for any future studies on butterflies as bio-indicators of climate change
 
 *Total number of butterfly species in India: 1,504
 
 *Number of butterfly species in Western Ghats: 334 (including 37 endemic species)
 
 Recommendations of the study
 
 *To increase the butterfly diversity in Bengaluru and using butterflies as climate change indicators
 
 *Continued efforts to collect data in the long-term to validate the findings of the report, and correlating the information with climate change
 
 *Meteorological data from each study site need to be collected to correlate butterfly abundance and climate change
