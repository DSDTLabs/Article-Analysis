This weekend’s episodes of   6 will have   interacting with the participants. With the teaser of the show giving us a glimpse of the star’s emotional side, the team at Super Singer promises this one to be a fun episode. 

 A source close to the channel says, “Simbu had come for the first season, way back in 2006. He never came after that. Now that he is also dabbling as a music composer, the team thought it would be best to invite him for the singing reality show. They have been requesting him for some time and things have worked out only now. Since he is making an appearance on the show after a 12-year gap, the team wanted to make it special.” 
 
 The source adds that once he came on stage, there was a huge uproar from the audience. “He has the ability to emotionally connect with the audience. And these weren’t just his fans; it was a mixed crowd. The highlight was that he was ready to do anything — be it singing or dancing. Usually, a big star would be a little apprehensive. But he was kind enough to oblige. He sang thrice — he rendered a few lines of Thalli Pogathey, a song from his own composition, and also when contestants   and   requested him to sing a few lines of a folk song. He had come straight from a shoot, but when the anchor asked him to dance, he did happily,” adds the source. The contestants sang hit numbers from both Simbu’s films and his father T Rajendherr’s movies. We hear that the actor also made an emotional speech that moved the audience and the team. The show is hosted by Priyanka and  , and the contestants are competing as teams — Team Unnikrishnan and  , and Team Benny Dayal and Anuradha Sriram.
