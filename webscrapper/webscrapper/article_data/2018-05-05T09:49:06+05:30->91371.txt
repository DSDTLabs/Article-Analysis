LUCKNOW: Hours after meeting   in Lucknow on Friday, Samajwadi Party leaders got down to shortlist the name of the party candidate for the May 28 Kairana   bypoll.

 
 SP is set to announce the candidate’s name within the next couple of days, even though some senior leaders hoped that RLD may eventually support SP in Kairana.
 
 Although what transpired at the hour-long meeting between SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Chaudhary was not immediately known, there was no announcement about a joint candidate as expected earlier.
 
 Senior SP leaders expressed hope that RLD may extend support SP in Kairana.
 
 In turn, SP is learnt to have assured reciprocation to RLD. Reports say that the two leaders discussed the issue of fielding an RLD candidate on SP symbol for the Noorpur assembly bypoll or vice-versa. Bypolls for Kairana and Noorpur are being held simultaneously.
 
 “The two leaders are likely to discuss the issues that had come up during Friday’s meeting with their party leaders to take a final decision in the next couple of days,” said Akhilesh aide MLC Udaiveer Singh. He said the meeting ended on a positive note.
 
 Sources said SP shortlisted names of four candidates for Kairana, including Tabassum Begum, who won the seat in 2009 on a BSP ticket. Tabassum is mother of SP MLA from Kairana assembly constituency Nahid Hasan and may get support of 3.5 lakh Muslim voters.
 
 Others in the list include former minister Kiranpal Kashyap and Rudra Sain. Both Kiranpal and Rudra Sain have been   loyalists and also have a good rapport with Akhilesh. They have been recently called to the party headquarters for a meeting.
