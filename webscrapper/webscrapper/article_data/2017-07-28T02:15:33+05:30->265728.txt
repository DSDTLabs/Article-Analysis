MUMBAI: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court on Thursday dismissed the plea of the state and students to review its earlier order which allowed students who had not taken class X exam from Maharashtra to be considered for the state quota seats in medical colleges.

 The Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) has readied its first seat allotment list for medical courses. The  , which was to release the first seat allotment list on Tuesday, is now expected to release it on Friday morning.
 
 As per the order of the Aurangabad HC bench, students who did not take the class X exam from the state, but took class XII exam here and have a   would be considered  .
 
 Accordingly, the list of 396 such medical aspirants have now been included in the seat allotment list. They will be considered as state quota students and will have the right to seats in government colleges and to the 85% seats in private medical colleges. Experts, however, said among these students only 29 are in the first 1500 ranks and are eligible for government college seats.
 
 But the list drawn up by the DMER of over 750 students who have been weeded out from the admission process, will still not be part of it. These over 750 students were called by the DMER with their original documents and they failed to produce their class X and class XII certificates from Maharashtra.
 
 On Wednesday, the DMER had filed an appeal before the Aurangabad HC bench demanding that only those students who have cleared their class X and class XII from Maharashtra and hold a domicile certificate be considered eligible as state students. But with the state and students losing the case, the seat allotment list will include those who have pursued class X from out of the state, given class XII from Maharashtra and hold a domicile certificate.
