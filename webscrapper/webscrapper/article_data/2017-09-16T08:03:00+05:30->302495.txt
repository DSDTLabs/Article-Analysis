KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Friday extended its deadline to repair broken city roads till September 23. However, during a meeting held with the civic body and other government agencies later in the day, Kolkata Police brass expressed concern over poor road condition and urged all stakeholders — including   — to wrap up the repair work by early next week.

 Deputy commissioner (traffic) V Solomon Nesakumar came prepared to the meeting with a list of bad roads with photographs. Some of the stretches that Nesakumar mentioned include   intersection, Ruby crossing and Anwar Shah Road intersection. The wretched condition of some roads — Taratala Road, Hyde Road and some parts of Circular Garden Reach Road — under Kolkata Port Trust’s jurisdiction was also discussed at length. 
 
 “Please ensure that some stretches of Taratala Road and Hyde Road are taken care of,” he told KoPT officials. In reply, a KoPT representative assured that the roads will be repaired latest by September 22. 
 
 The senior cop then shifted his focus to some roads along city’s tram tracks. “RG Kar bridge and Sealdah flyover have broken to such an extent that bikers find it difficult to drive,” the DC (traffic) said. A   promised to stick to the KMC deadline to repair these roads.
 
 Civic officials have also been requested to make necessary arrangements for draining out stormwater if it rains heavily.
 
 Soumitra Bhattacharya, the KMC director-general in charge of the roads department, pointed out the deplorable condition of Diamond Harbour Road and requested Railway Vikas Nigam Ltd representatives to look into the stretch, especially in areas where Metro stations are being built. 
 
 Besides road condition, a section of KMC officials expressed concern over non-functioning street lights and telephone cables hanging at several places.
