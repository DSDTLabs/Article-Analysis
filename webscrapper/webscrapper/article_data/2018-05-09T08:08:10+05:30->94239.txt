AMRITSAR: Forcible shifting of saroop of   from a New Zealand gurdwara and tossing of the   of a Sikh preacher Bhai Amrik Singh Chandigarh in UK has evoked s sharp reaction from Sikh leadership and intellectuals.

 
 Condemning the act, former director of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) Sikh History Research Board and writer Harjinder Singh Dilgeer wrote on his Facebook account: “It’s a highly condemnable incident and every Sikh should censure the incident. I don’t agree with Harnek Singh Neki, since he has also used objectionable language against me but shifting of Guru   from his gurdwara just because he is president of the same gurdwara is wrong.”
 
 Chief of prominent Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal Harnam Singh Dhumma, whose followers are considered behind shifting of the holy book, told TOI on Tuesday that according to his information, the Sikh sangat of New Zealand had acted on the directions of   and shifted Guru Granth Sahib from Neki’s Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Papatoetoe, Auckland, to another gurdwara in accordance with Sikh rehat maryada (Sikh code of religious conduct).
 
 In the recent past, Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh had directed investigations into alleged objectionable uttering against the Sikh gurus by Neki, who is a preacher and host of ‘Radio Virsa’.
 
 In another incident, Sikh preacher Bhai Amrik Singh Chandigarh was not only prevented from delivering a sermon in Southhall’s Park Avenue gurdwara on Monday but his turban was also removed by some miscreants.
 
 Condemning the incident,   (Delhi) president Paramjit Singh Sarna said, “Amrik Singh Chandigarh is not only a good human being but also an excellent preacher. Tossing his turban in UK would set a wrong example especially when Sikhs around the world were fighting to wear turban. He was being criticised by many for his views on Dasam Granth.”
