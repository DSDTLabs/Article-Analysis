Starring debutants Shiv Tandel and Neha Deshpande in lead roles, the Sai Suneel Nimmala directorial seems to be a murder mystery surrounding a serial killer and his thirst for blood. The film features five songs on its OST composed by Kiran Venna. 
 
 First on the album is Maar Maar, featuring LV Revanth’s vocals and Sai Suneel Nimmala’s lyrics. The mass number has tepid lyrics, tune and music, with Revanth’s vocals making it bearable. However, even the singer’s energy cannot do much for this number that sounds like a mix of every other Tollywood mass number, complete with the token English bit inserted in the middle. 
 
 Next on the album is Chitranga Nanne Chusav, sung by Lipsika and Anudeep Dev, penned by Sai Suneel Vennela. The slow and soft number is the token romantic number in the album with good enough vocals, lyrics, tune and music. However, there’s nothing memorable enough in this number to elevate it. 
 
 Shravana Bhargavi’s Sinnapude Telavale, featuring Kasarla Shyam’s lyrics, is a special number with jarring music, vocals, tune and silly lyrics. Trying hard to be a ‘special number’ the guitar music on this number is as over the top as the vocals are. Nothing memorable enough in this number either. 
 
 Fourth on the album is Shruthini Chusa by Dinker Kalvala with lyrics by Sai Suneel Vennela. Another romantic slow and soft number, this one fails to make a mark too. Last on the album is Paarahushar, featuring Ramya Behara’s vocals and Sai Suneel Nimmala and Deepthi’s lyrics. Trying to set the mood of the film as a racy thriller, this song kind of gets halfway there, if only it had better lyrics and music. 
 
 All in all the album of   has nothing much to write home about. Filled with silly lyrics and stunted music, this one's a major miss.
