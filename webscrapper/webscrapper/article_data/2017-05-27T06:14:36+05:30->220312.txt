CHENNAI: After a petrol outlet racket was exposed in   earlier this month, the state legal metrology department conducted inspections in 120 outlets to look for electronic chips that rigged fuel dispensers.

 The checks conducted in Chennai, Coimbatore and   found no electronic tampering, but officials say complaints related to general tinkering of dispensers continue to keep the department on their toes.
 
 Every year, officials come across at least 100 fuel nozzles that dispense petrol or diesel lesser than what the customers pay for even though the meter may show otherwise.
 
 Statistics obtained by TOI shows that the number of fuel outlets in the state caught tinkering with dispensers stood at 28 in 2012-2013, in 2016, the number rose to 40. Many these cases were from Chennai. In one case, officials found the nozzle dispensing up to 40ml less for every five litres. From 2009, close to a 100 fuel outlets in the city were booked and a fine of Rs 1lakh collected from them.
 
 Officials in the legal metrology department said they suspend the licence of dealers if the fuel supplied is found to be more than 25ml short of the specified quantity. “The licence is renewed only after the meter is reset. If there are any doubts regarding the quantity of fuel dispensed, customers can then check the quantity of fuel using a five-litre jar available in every fuel pump,“ an official said.
 
 G Santhanarajan, director of Consumer Association of India, said the number of cases could be a lot more if customers are aware of how to check tampering and who to report to.
 
 There are around 4,700 petrol outlets in Chennai and 22,000 nozzles dispensing fuel.
 
 “The business is completely transparent now because the entire system is automated. Tinkering is next to impossible with all the checks and balances in place now,“ said Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers' Association vice-president K  .
