SURAT: An 8.5km   to Udhna will be constructed by   (SMC). This   will shorten the distance from Kamrej to Udhna by 3.5km. The project is being undertaken with   and central government. 

 About 6km of the road will have a width of 60 foot and the remaining portion towards Udhna would be 80 foot wide. This project will take four years to complete because encroachments need to be removed from both sides of Koyli creek. SMC is also undertaking beautification project on both sides of Koyli bridge. 
 
 An officer of SMC said, “We will begin work on land where there is no encroachment. As space gets vacant, that will be brought under the project.” 
 
 The project essentially seeks to cover the whole stretch of Koyli creek by reinforced cement concrete road. People will also stop throwing garbage into the creek which will increase its carrying capacity. At present, the carrying capacity of the creek is 79 cusecs and it will increase to 94 cusecs when the first stretch of 5.5km road is built. This will solve flooding of the creek during monsoon season. 
 
 The project will cost Rs449 crore. The 5.5km portion of the road is covered under Surat smart city project. The finance for the project will be given to SMC under the Smart Cities Mission by the central government and under Swarnim Gujarat by the state government.
