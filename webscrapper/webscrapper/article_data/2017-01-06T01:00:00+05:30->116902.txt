Bizarre, bad and ugly — anything can happen on  . But Swami Om, who is part of the commoners’ contingent this season, did something extremely shocking even by the reality show’s standards — he threw his urine on celebrity contestants   J and   during the captaincy task. What followed was his ouster from the show. BT spoke to Bigg Boss’s recently-evicted contestants Gaurav Chopraa and Sahil Anand about their tryst with the controversial man.
Gaurav Chopraa: I was particular about not getting into unnecessary tiffs in the house. In fact, Swami was the only person who used to provoke me. He was violating rules all the time and once, I even had to hold him tight as no one was taking any action against him. And then, he claimed that I was trying to kill him! He has a lot of venom. He seems to think that celebs come from another planet — he had spoken insane things about the celeb contestants this season. Swami carries weapons like knives in his pocket, and also practises black magic. For example, you would sometimes find oranges with masks and spoons under your pillow. I am out of the show and away from that mad man, sane and surviving.
 Sahil Anand: 
 First of all, I don’t think he is a Swami. Om thinks that he’s an entertainer, but in reality, he is pathetic and psychotic. I guess, he does not even know what entertainment means. According to me, he is the most disgusting Bigg Boss contestant across seasons. How can someone throw his pee on co-contestants? His abominable and appaling behaviour is not at all justified. Wonder why the makers had to wait for him to pee on Bani and   to kick him out. He should have been thrown out long ago.
