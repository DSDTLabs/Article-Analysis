PATNA: The   on Tuesday predicted   with gusty winds in the city and several other places in the state on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

 The   (IMD) bulletin also stated that favourable conditions for thunder squalls and isolated heavy rainfall are likely to develop over some parts of eastern India, including West Bengal,  , Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura.
 
 Met officials at Patna attributed the expected thundershowers to a western disturbance as well as an east-west trough from east Bihar to Manipur across south Assam. “A western disturbance is situated over Jammu and Kashmir and moving eastward. The east-west trough is expected to lead to moisture incursion in the region. The two systems together are likely to lead to thundershowers at isolated places in the state,” a senior Met official said. 
 
 As per private weather agency  , temperatures may shoot up to 40 degrees Celsius at places like Patna, Gaya, Supaul and Bhagalpur.
 
 “For the last five to six days, the temperature over most parts of Bihar are witnessing a rise. So much so that sparing Patna, the temperature has maintained a constant upward trend with the mercury levels rising from mid-30 degree Celsius to its upper limits. In fact, the maximum temperature in Patna and Bhagalpur has even touched 37 degrees Celsius on a few occasions,” the Skymet stated on Tuesday.
 
 It attributed the northward movement in the mercury column to the lack of rain for almost the last 10 days. In addition to this, the region is swept by moderately dry northwesterly winds that are devoid of any significant moisture due to which pre-Monsoon activities have also taken a back seat.
