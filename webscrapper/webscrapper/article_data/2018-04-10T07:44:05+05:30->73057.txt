JAIPUR: The recent incidents including murder of woman returning along with her husband from Murlipura locality and the cases in which miscreants are vandalizing the cars parked outside home have depicted poor night patrolling in the city. Many areas like Pratap Nagar, Agarwal farm, Murlipura, portions of   a few others seems alien places for the Jaipur’s traffic police and even seems patrolling in these area is of least priority for the police.

 Senior police officers of the   admitted that the expansion of Jaipur from left, right and centre is becoming a challenge. They have also admitted that the withdrawal of nearly 400   due to some finance issues has also added to the problems of night patrolling.
 
 
 These days the incidents like of miscreants   on cars parked outside house are on the rise and similarly the incident in which a couple was attacked in which the wife got murdered have given an idea on the night patrolling. When contacted, Nitin Deep Blaggan, additional commissioner of police, law and order, said, “We keep on reviewing the law and order in various areas and keep on changing the deployment. The withdrawal of 400 home guards is been a problem still we are managing with the police station staff.”
 
 TOI spoke to the natives of Agarwal farm, Pratap Nagar, Jagatpura and others to know if they witness any night patrolling. “They are focussing on the catching a truck or stopping vehicles to check drunken driving which is good. My suggestion is that they should send their night patrolling vehicles especially the PCR vans in various localities. These are mobile vans and should keep moving,” said Ghanshyam Gupta a native of Agarwal farm.
 
 Some of the officers admitted that there are some grey areas and some issues. “Earlier we had 1000 home guards for Jaipur which is been downsized to 600. We are in touch with the   to give us 400 more home guards,” said  , commissioner of police.
