PATNA: The anti-corruption branch of CBI has lodged an FIR against the relatives of Bihar transport minister Chandrika Ray for alleged misappropriation of Rs 4.24 crore in connivance with two United Bank of India (UBI) managers in 2016.   The FIR registered by the central agency’s Patna unit on Tuesday has named Bidhan Chand Ray, Bidhan’s son Abhishek Roy, Abhishek’s wife Kavita Roy, UBI Fraser Road (Patna) branch’s then branch manager Arvind Narayan Singh and senior manager (credit) Kumar Anand as accused.    The FIR says the Rays entered into a criminal conspiracy with the bankers to get Rs 4.7 crore sanctioned as loan without proper documentation to one Sudhir Kumar. The amount was used unlawfully to maintain an overdraft account of Sonali Autos Private Limited.    Sonali Auto’s directors are Bidhan, Abhishek anbd Kavita. Bidhan is the brother of Chandrika, who is a minister from the RJD quota in the Nitish Kumar-led Grand Alliance government.    The minister, however, washed his hands of the case. “We do not have any relations whatsoever... I have been living separately from my brother for years now,” the minister told a section of the media.    According to CBI sources, preliminary investigation revealed Sudhir’s loan account was opened fraudulently. Later, a sum of Rs 3.65 crore was transferred from it to a savings account, which was opened in the name of Sudhir and one Kaushalya Devi without even filling the account opening form and KYC document.    The same day on January 28 last year, Rs 3.64 crore was debited from Sudhir’s account and credited to the OD account of the Sonali Auto, a Mahindra & Mahindra showroom located at Anisabad in Patna.    On June 6 last year, another Rs 60 lakh was debited from the loan account and transferred to the bank account of Mahindra & Mahindra in Mumbai without the signature of Sudhir or Kaushalya anywhere on the bank’s documents.    The FIR says the conspiracy led to revenue loss to the bank.
