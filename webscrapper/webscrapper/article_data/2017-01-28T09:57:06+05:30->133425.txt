AHMEDABAD: The   (I-T) department on Friday conducted a seminar involving banks and post offices (POs) with regard to requirement of furnishing information by January 31 of all account holders who have deposited more than Rs 12.5 lakh in current accounts and Rs 2.5 lakh in savings and other accounts post demonetization.

 In a drive to detect ‘black money’ after the centre’s decision to demonetize high value currency notes, the Intelligence &   of the I-T held the seminar on a recent notification issued by   (CBDT), which has mandated them to file Statement of Financial Transactions (SFT) on specific cash deposits. The deadline of furnishing such information has been preponed from May 31 to January 31 for last year’s transactions.
