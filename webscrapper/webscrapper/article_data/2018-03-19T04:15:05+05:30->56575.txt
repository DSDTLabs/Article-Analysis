MUMBAI: A 34-year-old  , Shailesh Kadam, was arrested from his residence on Sunday after a woman alleged that he had molested and stalked her. The 30-year-old Bhoiwada resident said that the cop had also sent messages about her on some Whatsapp groups. Though Kadam was booked last week, he was untraceable. 

  The woman and Kadam, who is unmarried, stay in the same building and her father has a tailoring shop on the ground floor. Last year too, the woman had accused the cop of molesting her, following which he was arrested. She has claimed that after getting a bail, he started troubling her again. 
 
 "When the woman would go to help her father, the cop would sit near the shop and pass derogatory comments. Later, he started following her. The woman later found out that he had been posting messages about her. She then approached the police and lodged a complaint," said a police officer. The woman's father has said that on Friday, when he approached the Bhoiwada police to lodge a complaint, his complaint was not entertained and he had to approach DCP N Ambika.
