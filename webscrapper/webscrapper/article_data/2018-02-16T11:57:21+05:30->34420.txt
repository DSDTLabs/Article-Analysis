AJMER: Wanted in the sensitive Ajmer   scandal,  , a resident of  , surrendered in the district court on Thursday after 26 years. The court later sent him to judicial custody.

 The Ajmer blackmail was the biggest scandal of Rajasthan in 1992 in which about 80 girls were raped and blackmailed with photographs. Many of these girls were school students. Later, 30 victims came forward and 12 filed cases against the accused. But only two victims appeared in the proceedings at the court. The girls faced humiliation and threats after the scandal surfaced.
 
 Suhail had managed to flee after the scandal came to light in 1992. The court seized his property and issued an arrest warrant against him. Though the police tried to arrest Suhail, there were rumours that he had fled to   and settled there. He was one of the main accused of a gang which befriended young girls. They later gang-raped and took photographs and videos of victims. On Thursday afternoon, Suhail appeared in the court with his advocate and surrendered.
 
 The gangâ€™s modus operandi involved first trapping a person and then forcing the victim to bring her friends in contact with them.
 
 The scandal was so sensitive that Ajmer remained closed for two days and there was pressure on the state government.
 
 The scandal became public when a group of journalist got the photographs of victims from the lab where these photos were sent for developing.
 
 Police identified 16 accused in this matter, with eight of them being sentenced for life imprisonment in 1998.
 
 The scandal was sensitive as Farooq Chisty, a former youth Congress leader, was found involved in it. But during his trial, he was declared mentally unstable. Another accused Purshottam and two others committed suicide while trial was pending and another culprit   was arrested in 2012 by the police.
 
 Following the surrender of  , the trial against him will start on charges of rape and blackmailing.
