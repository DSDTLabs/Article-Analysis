CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has sought a detailed report by Thursday on the environmental departmentâ€™s probe into the molasses spill in the   on May 17. 

 A large quantity of molasses had leaked from a sugar mill at Kiri Afghana village, near Beas town, killing thousands of fish in the river. 
 
 Amarinder warned officials against any laxity and directed the agencies concerned to vigourously pursue legal and penal action against offenders. The chief minister has ordered immediate release of additional fresh water into the Beas to stabilize the situation.
 
 The chief minister also directed departments concerned to expedite their investigation, so that they could fix responsibility for the act and guilty could be brought to book. A spokesperson for the CM said the Punjab Pollution Control Board(PPCB) would hold a formal hearing into the matter on Thursday. He said the wildlife department had already started prosecution for the loss of aquatic life in the spill. 
 
 The water resources department has also initiated legal proceedings against the mill under the Canal and Drainage Act.
 
 The chief minister, on Wednesday, also reviewed steps taken to check the quality of canal water being supplied in affected areas. As per PPCB reports based on samples from different places, the quality of raw canal water has almost normalised. The departments of water supply and sanitation, and the local government, which are responsible for water supply to villages and towns in the affected districts, are continuing with regular testing of water quality, both in the water works and of the untreated raw canal water. Also, as a precautionary measure, the water supply agencies have also initiated cleaning of waterworks to negate any possibility of contaminated treated water being supplied to the local population.
