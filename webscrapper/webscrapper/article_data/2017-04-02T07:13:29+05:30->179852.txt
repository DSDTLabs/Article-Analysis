PATNA: Patnaites can soon watch nocturnal animals in their simulated   at the zoo in Patna with the administration renovating their ‘Nocturnal House’, which will be opened in May this year.
 
  Built on around 4,000sqft area, the enclosure will house eight species with the main attractions being  ,  , civet cat, fox, porcupine, hedgehog, eagle and slow loris. The state government has given Rs 65 lakh for the renovation of the Night House which will also have perching facilities, hideouts and dry tree branches for the animals.
  
  Patna zoo director Nand Kishor told this reporter the renovation work started two weeks ago and it would be finished by April-end.
  
  “This enclosure was closed for 19 years; it was in fact never used. The zoo, which received over 20 lakh visitors every year, has almost all the nocturnal animals species except bats, but they are scattered in different small enclosures. Now, they will have one exclusive enclosure with an appropriate environment for them,” Nand Kishor said, adding visitors with zoo entry tickets would not have to pay any additional fees to visit the  .
  
  Another zoo official, preferring anonymity, said a special night-time   would be installed in the enclosure to inversely adjust the length of the day so as to facilitate the exhibition of animals during daytime. The illumination system will help invert the normal sleep-wake cycle of the animals, he said.
  
  According to him, the Nocturnal House’s lights will be dimmed in the morning so that animals remain awake during daytime. Bright lights at night will make them fall asleep.
