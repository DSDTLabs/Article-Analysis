HUBBALLI: The road between   and   in  , which was developed and made free for   movement by the police department, is once again crying for attention.

 Now, a pond like   on the entrance of the road from Ambedkar Circle has been hampering smooth movement of traffic. Yet, none of the civic authorities are initiating measures to repair the road, say citizens.
 
 Sudhakar Rao, an employee of a private bank on the road, said civic authorities should not waste time and take up repairs soon. Because of collapsed of road, vehicles are moving on only one side of the road, which is causing more problems,” he said.
 
 S M Ganachari, zonal assistant commissioner, Zone 8,  , said the road collapsed after an old nala retaining wall under the road collapsed suddenly. “We have prepared a detailed estimate for the repair work. The work will cost Rs 30 lakh and a proposal has been submitted to the commissioner’s office,” he said.
 
 “Due to the model code of conduct being in force, it was not possible to call for a tender. Hence the process was delayed. Once we get approval, the tender will be floated. Work will begin in another 20 -25 days,” he added.
 
 A few months ago, entry of vehicles on this road was banned by the police department. Yielding to pressure from citizens and various public police had opned the road for vehicular traffic. Police had installed dividers on the road before opening it for vehicles. Those moving from Desai Cross to   and from Station Road to   appreciated police for developing the road.
