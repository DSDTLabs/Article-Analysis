BHUBANESWAR: Bengali actor- turned-Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Paul, who was arrested by the CBI for his alleged involvement in the Rose Valley chit fund scam, on Sunday directed the blame at singer and union minister of state for heavy industries,  .

 “The CBI is not bringing Babul under its purview of investigation as he is a BJP leader and union minister. He was very close to Rose Valley management and availed undue benefits. He tricked me into the scam. I am innocent and never misappropriated any money,” Paul told the media at Capital Hospital here.
 
 The CBI, which arrested Paul in Kolkata on December 30, and took him on remand for three days on Saturday, took him to Capital Hospital after he complained of chest pain. Doctors, after examining his health, described him fine and sent him back to the CBI custody.
 
 Paul said he has already told the CBI about Babul’s alleged role in the scam. “There are many more people (BJP leaders and ministers), who availed financial benefits and hospitality from Rose Valley,” said Paul, who was one of the board of directors in the company accused of duping investors more than Rs 17,000 crore, at least four times more than the Saradha Group.
 
 Babul, in his twitter handle (@SuPriyoBabul) wrote: “I shall file a defamation case against this crazy man. Though, I still like to believe that he hasn't said this.”
 
 Babul, who has already denied Paul’s charges, was quoted in the media saying his name was being unnecessarily dragged into the ongoing controversy. Senior BJP leader from the state, Suresh Pujari, said Paul’s charges against Babul were baseless.
 
 Paul, however, kept mum when asked about the possible links of any politician from Odisha in the scam. Rose Valley allegedly cheated investors of nearly Rs 475 crore in Odisha. The firm got investors to deposit in its schemes by showing them a photograph in which the company donated Rs 2 lakh to the chief minister’s relief fund a few years ago in Odisha.
