MUMBAI: Elbowing out the co-passenger to hog the armrest is apparently the most annoying behaviour on a  , says a

 
   travel etiquette survey 
 
 by a travel search engine. It is closely followed by noisy children and chatty  .

 The confined spaces in an aircraft probably brings out the worst in passengers. Among those surveyed, 47% said armrest hogging tops their list of annoying behaviour by fellow passengers, followed by 46% who mentioned noisy children and 37% for whom chatty co-passengers are the most annoying.
 
 The survey suggests that most Indian flyers can put up with littering and smelly food, as only 33% and 29% of the respondents found these to be annoying. Also, just 25% reported being infuriated by snoring passengers.
 
 Though 46% of travellers are irked by noisy children, only 8% admitted to letting their little ones run wild on an aircraft. “Offensive habits that travellers have admitted are itching (27%) and losing their temper (21%). Also, 9% of flyers regret drinking one too many on board,” said the survey by the global travel search engine Skyscanner. 
 
 Also, 46% of flyers confessed to waking up with bad breath on a flight. The survey took inputs from 1,000 travellers. The questions were in two categories: annoying traits of co-passengers, and undesirable traits a traveller might wish to shake off.
