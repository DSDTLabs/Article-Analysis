NAVI MUMBAI: The court receiver along with   officials and the local police evicted occupants from two illegal buildings—Avdut Chhaya and Dutta Kripa—in Digha’s   on Thursday. 

 The sealed flats in the two buildings have been handed over to Cidco. The   drive went off peacefully because of the heavy police cover, put in place after Tuesday’s clash between residents and media persons.
 
 As many as 76 families living in the two buildings have been now rendered homeless. “We have lost everything despite fighting for over two years. All our money has gone down the drain,” said Anjubai Gawade, a resident of one of the buildings.
 
 A decision on demolishing these structures will be taken soon, said P B Rajput, controller of unauthorized constructions, Cidco.
 
 “We had adequate force and the drive was peaceful,” said Chandrakant Katkar, senior police inspector of Rabale MIDC police station.
