BENGALURU:   Sastry is on a unique mission. The founder of Cab Dost, a social enterprise startup, is reaching out to over 1.5 lakh cab drivers in the city, assisting them in filing   returns and advising them on banking, saving schemes and insurance. 

 Drivers, who with the advent o f cab aggregators like   and Uber have seen a significant jump in monthly salary (from Rs 10,000-Rs 12,000 to Rs 50,000), and have become taxpayers, with their annual earnings crossing Rs 2.5 lakh. But most don't know how to file I-T returns or earn tax exemption. Yamuna is now working with cab aggregators, corporates and the Bangalore International Airport Limited to help such drivers. Yamuna founded Cab Dost in 2015. 
 
 In 2016, the startup conducted a three-day tax e-mela and collected documents of 180 drivers through WhatsApp and filed their returns for free. It has so far filed returns for 5,500 drivers and helped them get a total refund of about Rs 1 crore.
 
 "It's important to file returns as it will validate financial credentials of a person, particularly while applying for a bank loan. Normally, most drivers take hefty loans from private financial institutions at high interest," said Shafeeque T, co-founder of Cab Dost. The firm helped many drivers link their PAN cards with Aadhaar number. "The challenge was most were from rural areas and their names were spelt differently in each identity paper," said Shafeeque.
 
  The startup is educating spouses of cab drivers about various financial schemes. "When one driver died in an accident, his wife didn't even know where his bank account was," said Yamuna.
