Kochi Metro is expected to start operating soon and the whole of the State is excited and waiting to experience what's it like to travel via the metro rail.

 Meanwhile, through a social media post, actress   also shared her happiness about the project. She also said that   deserves to be lauded for roping in about 23 transgenders as employees, who will also start working in Kochi, soon. "It is a historic decision. Till the recent past, the transgenders were cast away from the mainstream. However, the attitude is slowly changing. I have worked with many trangenders in the movie field and I believe that they deserve a great future," she says.
 
 The actress goes on to add that even terming the group 'transgenders' is not needed, as "They are also us," she says, in the post.
