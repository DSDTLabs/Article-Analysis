Shimla: Additional chief secretary (tourism and civil aviation) Manisha Nanda said the state government was making best efforts to start heli taxi services at various tourist destinations of the state. She said this would not only give a boost to the tourism sector but also strengthen air connectivity with the neighbouring states.

 Nanda was presiding over a meeting of the officials of aviation companies, including Pawan Hans Limited, Skyone Airways, Ind Jet as well as Himachal Pradesh Hotel Association, Himachal Pradesh Tours and Travels Association and representatives of different hotels of the Shimla district.
 
 At present, the state has three airports at Gaggal, Shimla and Bhuntar, and the work was in progress at Rampur and Jhakri in Shimla district, Baddi in Solan district, Pandoh in Mandi district and Manali in Kullu district under Udaan-II scheme, added Nanda.
 
 She assured full cooperation of the state government to the air taxi companies who agreed to start operations in the state.
 
 To attract high-end tourists, a heliport was proposed in Shimla during the previous Congress regime and that was to be constructed near the Sanjauli- Dhalli bypass. While its construction could not begin during its time, the BJP government has decided to start work on it.
 
 Himachal Pradesh has 63 operational helipads across the state, including remote tribal areas, known for their exotic location.
