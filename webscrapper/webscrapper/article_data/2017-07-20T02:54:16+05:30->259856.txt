GURUGRAM: The already tawny landscape around NH-8 will lose more vegetation as around 2,000 trees face the axe to facilitate speedy completion of three   that are being built along the expressway. It will also mean more dust pollution and bad air days. 

 Urban development body   has already felled 8,500 trees since January this year for the three underpasses, which are coming up at  ,   and  . 
 
 Being developed at an estimated cost of Rs 1,005 crore by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the construction is expected to be completed within a year. Officials said as per the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Huda will have to seek fresh permission to cut more trees. 
 
 “There might be a need to cut a few more trees, about 2,000. As per the norms, the proposed areas will be inspected by officials concerned and trees will be cleared only after we get permission,” said a senior official at Huda.
 
 Huda officials, however, promised to plant at least three times the trees, which have been axed or will be cut for the underpass project.
 
 Since January, trees were felled near Signature Tower, Iffco Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Maharana Pratap Chowk and Shankar Chowk, and along MG Road and Sohna Road.
 
 Green activists have expressed serious concern over this rampant felling of trees in Gurgaon, which has of late been on top of the nationwide pollution chart, even beating Delhi, due to ever-worsening air quality. 
 
 “On one side, mindless cutting of trees has been going on illegally in the Aravalis. On the other hand, the authorities are removing green cover from the city. The number of trees that have already been cut is more than what is needed to carry out the construction. The areas around the highway are extremely congested and polluted, and thus, need more trees,” said Vivek Kamboj from Haryali (NGO).
