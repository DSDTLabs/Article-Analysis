LUCKNOW: With exit polls predicting a BJP win and chief minister   showing his willingness to take steps to keep "communal forces" at bay, the focus is on the climax to the seven-phase poll soap opera in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday. 

 The counting of votes will begin at 78 centres in 75 districts at 8am on Saturday and results are likely to be out by 1pm. UP CEO, T Venkatesh says secrecy will be maintained during the counting of votes. Postal ballots will be counted first, followed by retrieval of data from EVMs. The data will be uploaded by returning officers on a Gensis software. Media counters has been set up at all the counting centres as well as at the Election Commission office. Over 20,000 police personnel have been deployed across the state.
 
 After the exit polls, BJP workers on Friday were in celebratory mood, while SP and BSP leaders posed brave fronts, dismissing the predictions. Senior SP leader Azam Khan told reporters that his party was winning 380 seats while the BJP would be reduced to only 25 seats. A message circulated by BSP supporters said: "Congratulations to the BJP for winning the exit polls and congratulation in advance to behenji (Mayawati) for winning on the result day."
 
 Akhilesh Yadav had on Thursday said in case of a fractured mandate, instead of the President's rule and allowing the BJP to run the government through remote control, he would like secular parties to come together to stop the "communal forces" (read BJP). The SP-Congress alliance is hoping to stop the BJP juggernaut and lead the way for opposition unity in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
