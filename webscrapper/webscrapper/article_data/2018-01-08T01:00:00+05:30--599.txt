 Actress   Naik, best known for her serials 'Naagin', 'Dill Mill Gayye' and ' , was recently in Lucknow to promote her latest show '' Tu Sooraj, Main Saanjh Piyaji'. The actress feels that due to her hectic schedule, she is always deprived of exploring the   city. "Whatever idea I have of the city, is from my friends who belong to Lucknow. This city is not only rich in culture, the people here are rich at heart and are very warm. Lucknow is a city of love and I am really desperate to know more of what Lucknow is really about. Though I have a fair idea about the monuments here, I really want to go see them and get a firsthand experience," said Madhura, who has visited the city a couple of times in the past too but has never been able to go around in the city. 
 Raised in  , the actress feels that not being able to speaking Hindi properly was the first thing that created a barrier in her acting career, initially. "Whatever I am today is because of my directors. Without their sheer hard work on me, I wouldn’t be an actor. My first show ' ' was such a big challenge for me. I remember one day,   came to the set and scolded me that ‘you don’t know how to act, why did we cast you’? She asked me to stay on the set till I learnt the technique of correct dialogue delivery. At that time I felt very humiliated. But I said to myself that if I don’t learn by tomorrow and do not perform well, then this is going to be the end of me. That fear gave me the confidence to act well," said she.
