AHMEDABAD: A   on Thursday rejected an application by the Supreme Court-appointed   (SIT) for  , who was apprehended sixteen years after a violent mob killed 69 persons at   during the 2002 riots.

 The court rejected SITâ€™s the demand for 10-day remand of Pande by not believing its reasons to question Pande in custody.
 
 One of the reasons SIT put forth was that Pande was allegedly wielding a pipe when he was seen in the mob by witnesses at Gulbarg Society in Chamanpura on February 28, 2002. Police wanted to recover the pipe. The court commented that it was not believable that the accused kept the pipe with him while he was on the run for 16 years. If the accused had hid the pipe, it is difficult to believe that the pipe would have been lying at the same place after so many years. The probe agency cannot get remand on such issues.
 
 In 2016, a special court delivered a verdict in the Gulbarg Society massacre convicting 24 persons while acquitting 36 others. The court had refused to believe there was a criminal conspiracy hatched before the attack on the Muslim colony.
