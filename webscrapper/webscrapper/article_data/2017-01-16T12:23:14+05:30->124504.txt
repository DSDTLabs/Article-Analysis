BATHINDA: Congress workers staged protests on Sunday to demand a change in the party’s candidates fielded from   in Faridkot and Maur segment in Bathinda. Party leaders at the two constituencies served an ultimatum to the high command to review its decisions by January 17, saying that they would otherwise oppose the candidates.

 Congress has fielded former SAD MLA Harnirpal Singh ‘Kuku’ from Kotkapura and Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim’s relative and three-time MLA Harminder Singh Jassi from Maur. Unhappy with the Congress’s ticket to Jassi, his cousin Manjit Kaur and her husband, Raghbir Singh, protested outside Jassi’s residence at Jassi Bagh Wali village on Sunday.
 
 In Kotkapura, several Congress workers, led by former PPCC secretary Ajaypal Singh Sandhu, held a meeting and demanded the party to review its decision to give the ticket to Kuku. There was a rebellion in the party’s local unit immediately after Kuku’s candidature was announced on Wednesday. “We are hurt by the party’s decision to field an outsider. We have asked the high command to review its decision by January 17. Else, we will be forced to go against the party,” Sandhu said.
 
 In Maur,   and Sukhraj Natt held a meeting of workers and formed a 21-member committee to decide the next course of action. “The party’s ticket to outsider Jassi is unacceptable. We have asked the party to review the move by January 17, the penultimate day of filing nomination papers or we will accept whatever decision the committee takes”.
 
 When contacted, Jassi downplayed the rebellion in Maur. “Soon, all Congress workers and leaders will start campaigning for the party,” he said.
