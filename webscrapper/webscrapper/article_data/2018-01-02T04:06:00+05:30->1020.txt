Nagpur: Private hospitals and doctors have announced a 12-hour bandh, from 6am to 6pm, on Tuesday for the outpatient services under the banner of Indian Medical Association (IMA) to protest the   (NMC) bill that comes up for discussion in Parliament on Tuesday. 

 NMC, a nominated and completely government controlled body, will replace the autonomous and elected Medical Council of India (MCI). Following call by national IMA, the city IMA president Dr Vaishali Khandait said the medical college students will also not be attending college for the whole day on Tuesday. “We are observing Tuesday as black day,” she said.
 
 She called the bill anti-patient, anti-poor, pro-rich and pro-private medical college managements that would open the doors for bigger corruption. “The new NMC will allow anyone to start a private medical college without permission of the commission (earlier MCI) by just submitting an undertaking on following the norms. The colleges can also increase their undergraduate or post graduate seats by themselves,” she said.
 
 IMA secretary Dr Prashant Rathi said NMC would be totally a non-representative body having maximum people from various other sectors and not enough doctors. “Such a body will be a disaster,” he said.
 
 Dr Ashok Adhao, former national IMA president from city, said the private colleges would also be able fix their own fees for 60% of their seats and only 40% seats will be regulated by government. “This is opening doors for back door entry to medical colleges for students who are rich and can pay huge fees. What kind of doctors will be generated by these colleges,” he asked.
 
 Dr Y S Deshpande, Maharashtra state IMA president, said provision for financial penalties that can range from Rs5 crore to Rs100 crore for deficiencies had huge loopholes that could open floodgates for corruption.
 
 Dr Prakash Deo, joint secretary of state IMA, said NMC bill was also allowing doctors from other pathies to practice modern medicine by undergoing bridge courses. “This will create half-baked doctors and is basically a short cut to meet the demand for doctors. This is indirectly giving these doctors the licence to kill,” he said. Also, these doctors will have double registration, with the NMC and their respective councils.
 
 Dr Shiv Joshi, national chairman of IMA students wing, said the bill will force the medicine students to take NEET entrance exam and then again take exit exam indicating the government did not have faith in its own system. “We take so many examinations during MBBS years, the internship examination and PG entrance and still we are being subjected to an exit exam. Isn’t it absurd,” he asked.
