TIRUNELVELI : In a shocking revelation, a government school teacher arrested on Thursday by the Panagudi   on charges of videographing women bathing in his area was found in possession of videos that show him sexually exploiting and abusing girl students.

 The accused had reportedly abused the students between 2008 and 2010, when he was working in a government-aided school.
 
 
 Anthonysamy, a computer science teacher, was booked under relevant Sections of the IT Act and the Indian penal Code (IPC) for possession of obscene pictures and videos and for allegedly threatening the person who questioned his act. The number of girls he abused is yet to be ascertained.
 
 Panagudi inspector D   said that they could not directly register the case under Pocso Act as the victims seen in the video were not ready to lodge complaints.
