CHENNAI: A believer in the force of   and a   by profession, Padmini Ramesh was appalled at the   and   around her home in   when she moved to Chennai.

 Twelve years ago, when she had enough of the shabby concrete dustbins located outside each house on her street, Padmini employed a man who was provided with a cart to collect waste from the neighbourhood.“At 11am, he would go around each house whose residents had agreed to ke ep their waste in garbage bags outside their doors.“ Within a span of a few weeks, the concrete dustbins we re no longer in use on her street, and the corporation finally agreed to remove them.
 
 Taking tiny yet successful steps, she finally took a leap towards fulfilling her dream of creating a cleaner and happier Anna Nagar through her Swachh Soul campaign launched in October last year which seeks to harness the positive energies of volunteers for the greater public good.
 
 A number of activities are carried out under the campaign including getting garbage cleared from the streets of Anna Nagar East, waste segregation at source, and planting of trees.Going door-to-door in Anna Nagar, her volunteers have managed to spread the word about the importance of segregating garbage before disposing of it.With the Chennai Corporation supporting the Swachh Bharat campaign, all households have started using the red and blue dustbins. “It is not fair to depend on the cor poration for everything. If we have ideas and the will to see the spaces near us clean, the local body needs to be prodded and given ideas, and it has been helpful in providing the means,“ says Padmini with pride.
