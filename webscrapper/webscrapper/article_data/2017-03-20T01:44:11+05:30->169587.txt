Ayodhya: About 130km away from Lucknow where Yogi Adityanath was sworn in in as UP’s new chief minister, sadhus and mahants of   cheered aloud, calling it the unfolding of the will of God to build Ram Temple after a wait of almost 25 years. The priests hailed ‘Centre mein Modi, State mein Yogi, Yeh Bhagwan ka sanyog hai ki   par mandir bane aur Ram Lala qaid se mukt ho (This coincidence of Modi ruling at Centre and Yogi in state points at building of Ram temple and freeing of Ram Lala).”

 Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, president of Ram and Krishna Janmabhumi Nyas said, “Since Yogi is a priest, he would work selflessly for everyone’s development, in the footsteps of Modi.” 
 
 Yogi shares a special bond with Digambar Akhara in Ayodhya and often visits here. One of the head priests Akhilesh Das said, “Yogi has the willpower and courage to fulfill the temple dream.”
 
 Ayodhya local Ram Shastri said, “On polling day, all sadhus motivate people to vote for BJP only for Ram Temple.” A worker at the Ram Janmabhumi Trust and workshop preparing for Temple’s construction for last many years, Birju said, “SP government had banned supply of stones from Rajasthan for building Ram Temple in 2015 but our work is 75% complete.”
 
 On the other hand, a shopkeeper Kaleem said, “No Muslim in Ayodhya voted for BJP but since Yogi is the CM, we will have to put up with him.” Ayodhya Muslim Welfare Board president Sadiq Ali said, “He can’t be biased against Muslims ashe has to take all communities along to win 2019 elections.”
 
 After 1992, Ayodhya never saw any major riot but some locals said that if BJP builds Ram Temple after SC allows and lets Muslims take over a nearby tomb as per HC orders, there will not be any problem. “But if anything is done forcibly, situation may turn violent”, said Asghar Ali, a resident of Begumpura, Ayodhya.
