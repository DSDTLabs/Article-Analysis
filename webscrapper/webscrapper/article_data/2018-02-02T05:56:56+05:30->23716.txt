PANAJI: In a bid to improve menstrual hygiene among female construction workers, the department of labour and employment has decided to install sanitary   dispensing machines at industrial estates, construction sites and government-run education institutions. The benefit is likely to be launched in April, and chief minister   is expected to make a budgetary allocation in his budget for 2018-19.

 The decision was taken on Thursday at a board meeting chaired by minister for labour and employment  .
 
 “Dispensing units will be set up at all industrial estates, high schools and places where children of these workers or the workers are directly working. There will be incineration points. This will provide a lot of sanitation and give people a sense of hygiene,” Khaunte said.
 
 According to officials, a final decision on the scheme’s implementation has not been worked out, and the government is still mulling on whether women should be provided financial assistance or direct supply of sanitary pads.
