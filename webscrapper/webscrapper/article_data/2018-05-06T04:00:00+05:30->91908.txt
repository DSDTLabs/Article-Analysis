Ahmedabad: The city police commissioner on Saturday issued a notification announcing the closure of the Madalpur railway underpass till August 20.

 According to the notification, the Railway Development Corporation is converting the track from metre gauge to broad gauge on the entire route. As part of this, the underpass will also be re-designed. 
 
 To facilitate this, the underpass will not be operational for three and a half months. Commuters will be able to take the Gujarat College flyover to go from Ellisbridge to Parimal Garden. Another alternative route suggested is the Mithakhali underpass to go towards Parimal Garden from Ashram Road. tnn
