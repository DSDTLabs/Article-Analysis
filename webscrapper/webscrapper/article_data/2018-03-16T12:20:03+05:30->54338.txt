 “According to Section 76 of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, all offences under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable. Hence, the high court should not have granted anticipatory bail to the persons who were arrested with smuggled liquor in their possession,” a senior excise department official said, adding the Supreme Court has not yet fixed the date of hearing in the matter.
 
 In one of the cases, the high court had granted anticipatory bail to one Rajendra Paswan, against whom a case was lodged with Magadh police station in Gaya district on August 30 last year after 1,804 litres of liquor were recovered from his godown. Paswan had pleaded before the bench of Justice Sudhir Singh of Patna high court that he should be granted anticipatory bail on the ground that he had no criminal antecedent.
 
 While granting anticipatory bail to Paswan, the high court had observed that the petitioner had no knowledge regarding storage of liquor in his godown. “The officials raiding Paswan’s godown did not comply with the provisions of Section 100 of CrPC,” the court had observed.
