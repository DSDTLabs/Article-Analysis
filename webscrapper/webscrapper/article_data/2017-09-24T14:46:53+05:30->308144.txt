NAGPUR:  , 60, was appointed as the new vice chancellor of the Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV),  , on Saturday by the Maharashtra governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao who is the chancellor of all state universities.

 Bhale, the associate dean who held the additional charge of registrar, succeeds   whose appointment was terminated on July 29 by the state government for not being an Indian citizen.
 
 Bhale told TOI that he will give focus to the development of eastern Vidarbha agricultural schools and colleges. “I know the weaknesses as well as the strengths of the PDKV due to my long association with it. Hence, I will be able to do justice to the job,” he said.
 
 The university is facing acute shortage of teaching staff as well as labour. Bhale said that he would try to make the appointments for all posts at the earliest. 
 
 “Since the research from the university can reach the farmers only through extension work, the PDKV will try to establish good connect with the state agriculture extension wing,” he said.
 
 The governor had appointed a search committee under the chairmanship of retired   judge   to recommend a panel of names for the VC’s post.
