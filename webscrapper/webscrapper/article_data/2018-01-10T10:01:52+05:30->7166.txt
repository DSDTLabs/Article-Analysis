CHENNAI:   came to the rescue of passengers stranded without MTC buses and fleeced by private buses on Tuesday, extending their service and dropping fares.

 There was a notable increase in the number of share autos plying on key routes including Gunidy-Ashok Pillar, Mogappair-DMS-T Nagar and Doveton-Moolakadai. 
 
 “After observing that the demand for share autos had shot up, these drivers who usually operate in the suburbs along Tambaram-Guduvanchery, Avadi-Ambattur and Thiruvanmiyur-Kovalam routes extended their trips to core areas in the city,” said B Anbalagan, a CITU representative of share auto drivers. 
 
 This in turn brought down the demand and many were forced to lower the ticket fare, particularly during non-peak hours, he added. For instance, share autos on normal days collect Rs 10 from a passenger on the Guindy-Pillar route. When TOI visited this stretch on Tuesday evening, there were longer-than-usual queues at share autos. Many drivers, eager to do more trips, collected only Rs 7 from passengers.
 
 However, another section of them made the most of the situation. “A share auto collected Rs 50 for a ride from Chennai Central to Koyambedu. Usually they collect only Rs 20,” said D Kalaiarasan, a resident of Tambaram. Almost 80% of the 1,800 share autos registered in Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram operated in core areas, said Anbalagan. 
 
 On Old Mahabalipuram Road, there was not much change in share auto and maxi cab rates. These autos came to the rescue of some disabled people who were being mistreated by temporary staff on MTC buses. “Without knowing the rules, some temporary conductors refused to accept concession passes of disabled citizens and made them pay the full ticket fare,” said S Namburajan, general secretary of   for the Rights of All Types of Differently Abled and Caregivers. 
 
 App-based taxi services effected surge pricing up to three times during the evening peak hours.
