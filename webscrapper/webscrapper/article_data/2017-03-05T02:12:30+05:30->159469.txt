VARANASI: UP CM   and   vicepresident   stepped on the gas two days before campaigning ends for the final phase of the assembly polls by holding an 8kmlong roadshow through Varanasi on Saturday.

 The six-hour event ran nearly parallel to PM Modi’s roadshow in the temple town.
 
 While Modi held a ‘jandarshan’ in the morning and returned from campaigning in Jaunpur in the evening to address a 0rally at Kashi’s Town Hall, Rahul and Akhilesh led the roadshow through several minority pockets crucial to Congress and SP, and also stopping for darshan, like Modi, at Kashi Vishwanath.
 
 In terms of numbers, this would have easily been the largest show SP-Congress have done together so far. Varanasi, which locals say is used to the idea of “lakhha mela” (gathering of 1 lakh people), turned out in large numbers to watch and support the second VIP show of the day.
 
 Film analogies seemed to be the order of the day. Supporters held out placards declaring the duo as   of the eponymous film, saying “the two youth leaders would, together, change the fate of UP and free it from the clutches of Modi and BJP.”
