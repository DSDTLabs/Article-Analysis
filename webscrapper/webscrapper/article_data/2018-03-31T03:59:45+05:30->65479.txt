MUMBAI: Former Congress MLA   has reached a settlement with a Bandra businessman against whom he had filed a complaint in 2015 accusing him of using gangster   to threaten him to resolve their property dispute. 

 With Siddiqui and   alias   last month filing consent terms before Bombay high court, the city crime branch is now wondering what will happen to their criminal case pending before the sessions court.
 
 In July 2015, the anti-extortion cell of the city crime branch had arrested Shams and   alias Langda for threatening Siddiqui. Siddiqui's complaint said Shams had invested Rs 1.4 crore in a project of his Zears Developers on Bandra's Hill road. A dispute had arisen, and Shams was pressuring him through Chhota Shakeel to settle it. Shams's brother Jabbar is based in Dubai and had apparently used his influence to pull Shakeel into the controversy.
  
 
 Sources said the crime branch got its first jolt in the case in 2016 when Shams challenged the application of the stringent MCOCA in the case as their fight was the fallout of a civil dispute. "We had to drop MCOCA and were proceeding with IPC sections 506 and 506 (2). Now, we have learnt that Baba and Shams have amicably settled their dispute, meaning they will not proceed in the criminal case. All our efforts and time has been wasted on this case," said an officer. 
 
 While Siddiqui remained unavailable despite several calls, Shams confirmed to TOI that he has filed consent terms with Siddiqui, but refused to elaborate further. The copy of the consent terms filed before Bombay HC judge S J Kathawala says the plantiff (Sayyed) is not pressing the civil suit against the defendant (Siddiqui and his son Zeeshan) as Siddiqui has agreed to pay Rs 1.4 crore to Shams.
