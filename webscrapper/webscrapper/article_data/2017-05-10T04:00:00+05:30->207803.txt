Vadodara: Vadodara district education officer (DEO) has asked two city-based CBSE affiliated minority schools to appear before the fee regulation committee which has been appointed by the state government to decide the fee structure of private schools under the Gujarat Self-Financed School (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017. Don Bosco High School, Vadodara, and Auxillium Convent High School had sought exemption from appearing before the fee regulation committee on the grounds that since they are already being regulated by both the Central Board of Secondary Education and the National Commission for Minorities, they cannot be put under the ambit of the new Act.  Earlier, the schools had moved the Gujarat high court arguing that since they are protected by Article 30 of the Constitution, which guarantees the minorities’ rights to establish and administer educational institutions, the Act should not apply to them.  “The HC has however ordered that the petitioners can submit their applications on or before June 15 instead of May 25. We have directed the two schools that they can submit their proposals before June 15 if they want to charge fees higher than the upper limit fixed by the Act,” said Vadodara DEO M L Ratnu, adding that if the schools charge fees higher than the upper limit without appearing before the fee regulation committee, the committee can suo motu take action against the schools.  The government has fixed Rs 15,000 for primary, Rs 25,000 for secondary and Rs 27,000 as higher secondary as upper limits of fees that the private schools can charge.  As per the rules, all private schools that charge fees more than what has been prescribed in the Act need to submit their proposal to the committee for which the deadline is May 25.
