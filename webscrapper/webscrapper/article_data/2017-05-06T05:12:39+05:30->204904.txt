 On Friday evening, Union minister of state for information and broadcasting Rajyavardhan Rathore directed J&K chief secretary Bharat Bhushan Vyas to en sure that action is taken against the cable operators concerned for playing out content banned by the ministry. He also asked the state government to furnish a compliance report to the ministry after action is initiated. 
 
 On Friday, TOI reported how sermons of Saudi clerics and Pakistani channels were being beamed directly to homes in the Kashmir valley. Rathore said the local administration in Jammu and Kashmir has the powers to confiscate equipment of cable service providers who are found illegally beaming news channels and propaganda material.
 
 “In Jammu & Kashmir, the local administration, district collector or an authorised government official can monitor the situation and confiscate equipment and take suitable action against cable operators,“ he said.
 
 Rathore said advisories on unauthorised channels were routinely sent by the Centre to J&K government.“We monitor such news whenever it comes up. It is a part of our work to seek reports and to designate officials to look into the matter. Action is being taken,“ he said.
