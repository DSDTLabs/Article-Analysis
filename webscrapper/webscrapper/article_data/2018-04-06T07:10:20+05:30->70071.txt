NEW DELHI: The   ( ) has set up a working group to examine issues related to   (HNIs) changing their tax jurisdiction and check possible revenue loss.

 
 According to sources, the government is dealing with a complex situation as the income is assessed by overseas tax authorities even as bulk of the assets remain in India in many cases. The working group will formulate the government's position on various aspects related to the issue and also suggest policy responses to mitigate the risk.
 
 They said the group, set up under CBDT chairman Sushil Chandra's guidance, comprises senior tax officials and is due to hold its first meeting on Friday. "The working group is expected to tighten the noose around tax planning using shifting of residency. This can lead to reduced tax liabilities in certain cases,
 
 especially in case of global assets. It would be interesting to see how the stringent Black Money Act can be extended to HNIs, who have generated substantial wealth in India and abroad and have shifted outside India," said Amit Maheshwari, partner at Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP.
 
 In recent years, there has been a spike in  , which according to the New World Wealth report, saw the second highest number of millionaires leave the country. While over 10,000 Chinese millionaires are estimated to have shifted overseas in 2017, around 7,000 uber-rich Indians changed their domicile, which is 16% higher than 2016, the report released last month said. The number is estimated to have increased steadily from around 4,000 in 2015 to nearly 6,000 in 2016.
 
 In any case, the government is keen to expand the tax base as very few HNIs are seen to be disclosing their actual income and most of the taxes come from the salaried.
