KOCHI: Obstruction caused to operation of online taxis at railway station premises by unions representing traditional taxis has been questioned before the high court.

 The challenge to unions’ obstruction, which is causing much discomfort to passengers too, was raised by   C, an online taxi driver who was beaten up by prepaid taxi service operators at   ( ) in February last year.
 
 In the petition, Navas has pointed out that the impediments presently created to operation of online taxis at railway station premises by union activists goes against an order issued by the high court on March 17th last year on his plea.
 
 While he approached the court after being attacked for operating out of Cial last year, services of online taxi services such as Uber and Ola had now been introduced in different parts of the state, such as Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, and Kozhikode, the petition said. The online taxi services had become popular not only in   but across the country, Navas pointed out.
 
 Since the court passed an order on March 17 last year asking state police chief to take action against those who prevent operation of online taxi services, taxi drivers’ unions affiliated to CITU, AITUC, INTUC, BMS, HMS, and TUCI had been violating the court’s order in different parts of Kerala, the petitioner alleged. As the service of online taxis had expanded to many places in Kerala since the filing of the petition last year, all trade unions of taxi drivers should be made parties in the case, Navas said in the petition.
 
 Advocate T  , who represented Navas , argued for making the unions parties in the case. At the same time, the counsels representing the unions questioned the court’s order last year that was general in nature whereas the petitioner’s plea was personal. The court will hear the case on Wednesday.
