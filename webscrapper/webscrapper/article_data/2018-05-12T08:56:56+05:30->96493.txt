ROPAR: Ropar sessions judge BS Sandhu on Thursday awarded the death sentence to a 28-year-old Ashok Kumar for killing two children of a woman with whom he was in a live-in relationship. In September last year, Ashok alias Pintu, who worked as a skilled labourer, took the children Manav (10) and Shivam (6) on the pretext of an outing near Satluj river.

 He picked them on his bike from the gate of Sanatan Dharam Secondary School at Ropar on September 25. Ashok then threw both the kids in a deep ditch near the bank of the river in Katli village of the district. Ashok, the resident of a village in Ghaziabad district of Uttar Pradesh, had killed the duo as he wanted his own children from the woman with whom he was living.
 
 A case of kidnapping under Section 363 of IPC at City Rupnagar police station was registered following the statement of Rajni — the mother of the kids — while Ashok also accompanied her to the police station. However, the police suspected Ashok’s statement as it did not match with his call locations. The police interrogated him, following which he admitted to the crime, and then revealed about the bodies.
 
 Rajni had got married three times in the past, and Ashok was her fourth husband. Her first two husbands had died, and she got separated from her third husband. The children were from her second and third marriages.
