LUCKNOW: The   (IMA) has come out in favour of two doctors of King  's   (KGMU) who had been accused of stealing a kidney from a Barabanki-based patient way back in 2015. In the doctors' defence, the IMA said that it was impossible to re-use kidney from an infected patient and so, the FIR against the two doctors should be quashed. 

 Addressing media in Lucknow on Monday, IMA representatives said a letter conveying the same had been sent to the DGP, Governor and the chief minister. The matter concerns allegations by   resident   who alleged the doctors stole his kidney during treatment at KGMU in 2015. 
 
 "A medical complaint can only be converted into an FIR after advice from a medical board, which was not followed," said IMA president Dr PK Gupta. "A Supreme Court ruling of 2005 confirms the same," added former chief medical officer Dr SNS Yadav. 
 
 Brushing aside allegations, one of the KGMU doctors said, "The patient, a trauma case, was brought in a bad condition on the evening on February 19, 2015. His small intestines were torn. The operation started at 11.45 pm and went on till early morning. No kidney related surgery was done." 
 
 KGMU's organ transplant surgeon Dr   said, "An infected kidney is impossible to be re-used scientifically and the process of transplant involves a large team and hours of preparation tests, even in cadaveric donation. It is not possible that his kidney was taken and transplanted." 
 
 KGMU spokesperson Dr Narsingh Verma said, "Records show that in fact two of our residents had given a unit of blood each to the patient."
