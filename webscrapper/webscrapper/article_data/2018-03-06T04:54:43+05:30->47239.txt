KOLKATA: Two naturalists stumbled across carcasses of hundreds of sea cucumbers, several turtles and a dolphin along a 6-kilometre stretch of the coastline near the popular beach destination, Mandarmani, over the weekend.

 The find has triggered alarm over the risk to endangered species posed by illegal fishing practices with wildlife activists calling for strict regulation of fishing activity during the breeding season.
 
 Arabinda Pal and Arnab Chatterjee said they were walking along the bank of Pichaboni river when they came across the 20 dead Olive Ridley and   turtles. They also came across a carcass of a Irrawaddy River dolphin, listed ‘vulnerable’ on the IUCN Red List. 
 
 “The turtles were caught in fishing nets. The deaths had occurred from drowning as they were unable to surface for hours,” said Pal.
 
 Locals said hundreds of sea cucumbers, scores of turtles and dolphins fall victim to illegal fishing each week between December and March — the nesting season for turtles. 
 
 The endangered   turtles make their annual trip up the   during the breeding months. Using the earth’s magnetic field, they travel thousands of kilometres to the beaches of Odisha. In recent years, due to disturbance along those coasts, they began frequenting the beaches near Mandarmani. 
 
 The Olive Ridley and Green Sea turtles and the Irrawaddy dolphin are protected under Schedule I, Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
 
 Chatterjee said he had seen a similar sight at   and Bakkhali. “These are not accidental deaths. Laying of large nets across the water for prolonged periods is banned. But they continue unabated, causing major harm to endangered species,” he said.
