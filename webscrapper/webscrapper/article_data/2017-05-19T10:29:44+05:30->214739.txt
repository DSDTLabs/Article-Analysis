KOCHI: India footballer   has been terminated from his job at the  's Office,   for low attendance during his probation period.

 Though officials from the Kerala government including state sports minister   had pleaded with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India to stall the move to oust Vineeth, officials in AG's office cited helplessness in extending the probation period of an officer for more than four years with shortage of attendance.
 
 The order issued by the Principal Accounts General, Thiruvananthapuram stated that if Vineeth fails to join for duty immediately, his services would stand terminated with effect from May 7, 2016. "Probation period cannot be extended beyond double the normal period (two years). Under no circumstances can Vineeth's probation be extended beyond four years and he has completed four years in service on May 6, 2106. Since he has not successfully completed the probation, his services has been terminated," says the order which was passed on Wednesday.
 
 "If they have taken the decision, then I don't have anything to say. I will keep on playing professional football," said Vineeth who is currently with the   outfit participating in the Federation Cup at Cuttack. "I'm yet to receive the order. I got this job through football. For me football is more important than the job," added the striker who was the joint Indian top-scorer in I-league 2016-2017 season.
