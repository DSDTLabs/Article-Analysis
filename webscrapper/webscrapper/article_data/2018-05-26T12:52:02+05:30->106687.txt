PANAJI: In 2017, for the first time the   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education saw 91.6% clear its Class X public exam.

 
 When the Class X results were declared on Friday for 2018, the pass percentage, at 91.3%, was not only on par with the previous year’s record, but also the average performance of students improved significantly at the test, Goa Board chairperson Ramkrishna Samant said.
 
  
  
 
 The pass percentage has been retained despite the fact that around 800 more students took the test this year. The average score of the 17,886 who cleared the exam is 62%.
 
 “Students are becoming increasingly competitive. And you can see it from the average marks scored. This average includes every student that has cleared the exam, including those who have got a pass class. It is significant. The average scored by students in the top 10 performing schools is as high as 75%, which is a distinction. Seventy-three per cent of all aided schools have 100% results this year,” said Goa Board secretary  .
 
 Twenty-one governmentrun schools recorded cent percent results this year. Less than a decade ago, there were government high schools that saw all students fail the exam.
 
 Goa Board chairperson Ramkrishna Samant said that with 92.4% having cleared the science paper and 94.3% having cleared the mathematics paper, the performance can be termed as good. This has been the lowest pass percentage among the subjects. The pass percentage for languages stood between 99% to 100% and for social sciences, it stood at over 96%. P 2
 
 
 
 The highest number of students answered from the Panaji centre, yet 89.1% from here cleared the test. The lowest pass percentage for any centre is 82% in Quepem. The number of schools attaining a pass percentage of 95% and above is as high as 170,” Goa Board chairperson Ramkrishna Samant said.
 
 The Class X exam of the state board was held from April 2 to 21across 27 centres.
 
 Four schools for special children—   for Special Education in  , two centres of Lok Vishwas Pratisthan in Dhavali, and St Xavier’s Academy in Old Goa—have also seen 100% of their students clear the Class X exam.
 
 In the last four years, Goa Board Class X pass percentage has jumped from 83.5% in 2014 to over 91% in 2017 and now in 2018 too. This is despite an increase of close to 1,000 students answering the exam.
 
 In 2018, the Class X exam was cleared by 88.69% boys and 90.49% girls.
 
 Sports merit marks were availed by 8,451 students, of which 376 cleared the exam with the help of the marks, this helped increase the overall pass percentage by 4.4%.
