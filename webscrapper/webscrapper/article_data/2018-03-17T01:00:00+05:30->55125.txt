After dating for almost four years, telly couple   and  , who is popular as Saumya in 'Shakti — Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki', are all set to take the plunge. The couple will tie the knot in the second week of June this year. Their families have met and the duo is finalising the date and venue for the wedding. 

 Confirming the news to BT, Rubina says, “Yes we are taking our relationship forward to a new phase... a phase where we will celebrate each other’s imperfection and create memories for a lifetime.”
 
 Abhinav adds, “Yes, we are getting married in June. We are yet to zero in on a date as we have a couple of options. The venue too is to be finalised.”
 
 About their decision to get married, he elaborates, “There was no pressure from either side. I was very clear that I won’t get married until I find the person I can be myself with and Rubina is just that. Also, we didn’t need any convincing to make up our minds. We just decided that we needed to take our relationship to the next level after dating for so long.” 
 
 Interestingly, Abhinav shared the marriage plans with Rubina’s family first. Says the actor, “I first informed her parents and my family connected with hers. I did bring up the topic of marriage with her, but it wasn’t followed by a dramatic Hollywood-like proposal of going down on my knees and popping the question.” 
 
 The wedding will be a mix of Himachali and Punjabi rituals, as Rubina is a Himachali and Abhinav, a Punjabi. “We will follow all the rituals. The only tradition I will skip is mounting the ghodi as I am completely against it. I don’t want to trouble an animal, who can’t express pain or exhaustion, to mark my big day,” he signs off.
