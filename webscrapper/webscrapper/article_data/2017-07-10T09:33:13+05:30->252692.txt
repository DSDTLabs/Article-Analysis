BHUBANESWAR/BERHAMPUR:   on Sunday took over the probe into illegal activities at a mini-telephone exchange in Berhampur and the alleged involvement of the operators with jailed   Chhota Rajan. 

 Berhampur Police on Saturday arrested four persons for allowing SIM boxes at the outlet, 'S World', to be used to place extortion calls to a businessman in Mumbai. "Our   (STF) will probe the case. A team of experts from STF, economic offences wing, and cyber police station has gone to Berhampur to gather details of the case from Gopalpur police station. An ASP-rank officer is heading the team," special director general (crime) B K Sharma said.
 
 The men arrested on Saturday were identified as T Laxmi Narayan Shroff, 31, of Chhatrapur, Pradeep Kumar Choudhary, 27, of Patapur, Suresh Kumar Satapathy, 30, of Berhampur, and Suresh Kumar Sahu, 32, also of Berhampur.
 
 The crime branch will take custody of the four men for further interrogation, Sharma said. The team is also likely to visit Mumbai where a real estate baron has lodged a complaint after receiving a ransom demand of Rs 2 crore from Rajan's aide Suresh Pujari. Police said Pujari had used a SIM box at 'S World' to place the extortion call. A probe has shown that SIM boxes used in 'S World' had been procured from China through a Hyderabad-based agent. 
 
 Some companies in New Delhi and Ahmedabad are suspected to be involved in the racket.
