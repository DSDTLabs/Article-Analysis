PUNE: Barely weeks after an Ahmednagar court granted bail to two criminals on police records, they headed to Pune to commit burglaries. The duo committed six   in the city over the past 20 days.

 A tip-off received by police constable   landed the suspects   Kale (25) and Atul Kale (25), currently residing at   in Maval taluka, behind bars yet again on Tuesday. The police have recovered 65gm gold and Rs35,000, collectively worth Rs2.10 lakh, from the duo. The crime branch (unit-II) team arrested the duo from Hinjewadi.
 
 Inspector   told TOI that the police got a tip-off that the two men would be reaching a jewellery store in Hinjewadi to sell stolen gold ornaments on Tuesday. “We laid a trap and took the suspects Atul and Pinya into custody. When we frisked them, we found the cash and gold jewellery,” the officer said.
 
 According to the officer, during the sustained interrogation, the duo revealed that they had been arrested by the Ahmednagar police in a dacoity attempt case and were released on bail in the last week of January. “They later reached Induri village and rented a room in a chawl,” Nikam said.
 
 At night, the duo would come to Pune to recce locked apartments and shops. They would break-into the apartments by breaking the locks or enter the shop by bending open the shutters. “In the last 20 days the suspects had committed burglaries across Kothrud, Bibvewadi, Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sinhagad Road and Pimpri,” Nikam said.
 
 The officer added that the suspects have 20 cases registered against them, including cases of dacoity, robbery and burglaries. Recently, they were arrested by the Supa police in Ahmednagar in a dacoity attempt case, Nikam said.
