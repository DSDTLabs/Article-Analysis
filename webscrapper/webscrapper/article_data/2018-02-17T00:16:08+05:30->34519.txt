Chennai: After more than a year of being in limbo, the Tamil Nadu Medical Council, the statutory body that registers doctors in the state, have seven new elected members.

 Around 25,000 doctors in the state sent their postal votes for the election, which was conducted by Madras High court-appointed administrator for the council Justice K Venkataraman, a retired judge. 
 
 The elected members include Dr Senthil, Dr Jeyasingh Thangavelu, Dr Thiygarajan, Dr Dhalapathy Sadacharan, Dr Sadagopan, Dr Ponnuraj, Dr Surendran RVS.
 
 Ballot papers were dispatched to more than 1.1 lakh doctors to elect the members among 37 contestants.
 
 The tenure of the last set of office-bearers drew to an end on June 19 with at least two members moving the court against each other with serious allegations of mismanagement and abuse of powers. The Madras high court then appointed Justice K Venkataraman, to conduct fresh elections. After verifying the electoral rolls, he had called for elections to the seven posts. 
 
 The functioning of the council has been marred by internal conflicts in the past. In 2016, the council’s then president Dr K Senthil was ousted in a ‘coup’ by a section of office-bearers. These members had made vice-president Dr J A Jayalal as the interim president. 
 
 The internal politics has inquiries into cases against doctors. In Tamil Nadu, decisions against at least five doctors involved in two infamous cases the hair transplant in a salon that killed a medical student and a doctor who pulled the plug of her ailing father in the intensive care unit have been pending for nearly two years now. Although the disciplinary committee recommended suspension of these doctors from the medical register, no action has been initiated against these doctors due to the lack of a quorum. Besides this, several complaints against doctors for unethical practices such as collecting kickbacks are pending inquiry.
