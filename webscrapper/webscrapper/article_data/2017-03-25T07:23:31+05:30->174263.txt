LUCKNOW: The crackdown on illegally run slaughterhouses and butcher shops across the state had led to a sharp fall in the production of both buffalo and   over the past three days. UP’s meat industry sources told TOI that while   production has fallen by 40%, mutton production, too, has seen a 30% decline. 

 “A large number of shops and slaughterhouses are closed either because they were running without licence or are on strike in protest,” said a meat seller. Though the ban is only on illegal meat shops and unlicensed slaughter houses, the crisis is a result of the hitherto lax attitude of officials which led to mushrooming of unlicensed outlets. 
 
 This led to a complete dependence of UP on illegally slaughtered and sold meat. 
 
 According to UP Meat-Murga Vyapari Kalyan Samiti, UP produces about 36 lakh kg of beef every day. This production has fallen to about 22 lakh kg. Since most shops were without licence, even supply of goat meat and chicken has been hit. Mohammad Iqbal Qureshi, state president of the association, said, “Supply of goat meat has fallen from 18.6 lakh kg to 12-13 lakh kg per day.”
 
 The association said the least affected category so far is of chicken as there are more licensed chicken vending points. The association said around 7 crore birds are consumed daily in UP.
 
 UP also contributes to a large part of country’s   (almost 60%). As per Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) records 2015-16, around 13.47 lakh metric tonnes of beef was exported from India in which UP’s contribution was about 8 lakh metric tonne. After state government’s ban, the beef export has also got hit.
