BENGALURU: If you are abusive towards an   driver, use verbal threats or if you damage the car or phone, intentionally spill food or drink, smoke or vomit due to excessive alcohol consumption in the car, you could be barred from using the service and your app deactivated.

 For the first time in India, seemingly in response to the recent strike by its drivers, Uber has issued a set of “community guidelines.” While they are for both drivers and riders, Uber has expressed particular concern about the way some riders tend to behave.
 
 “This (guidelines) is important because when drivers use Uber, they do more than simply drive: they’re sharing their own car, their space, their time and a slice of who they are with passengers. We all know drivers who go above and beyond to create a five-star experience for their riders: from helping an elderly person get into and out of the car to offering water for the trip, or making sure that riders get home safely after a night out,” Uber said.
 
 The cab aggregator said most riders show drivers the respect they deserve. But some don’t -- whether it’s leaving trash in the car, throwing up in the back seat after too much of alcohol or asking a driver to break the speed limit so they can get to their appointment on time, it said. “This kind of poor behaviour is not OK, which is why we will take action against passengers who are rude, abusive or violent,” an Uber release said.
 
 The aggregator’s guidelines come following complaints by drivers that they are often at the receiving end of riders, often for no fault of theirs. 
 
 The guidelines are being released in 11 languages in all 26 cities where Uber operates in India.
 
 Drivers can lose access to Uber if quality of their service suffers. This is estimated based on star ratings, cancellation and acceptance rates. The company said there is a minimum average rating in each city, and if a driver’s average rating falls below the minimum after multiple notifications to address the problem, he may lose access. Similarly, in each city, there’s a maximum cancellation rate, based on the average cancellation rate of drivers in that area. If a driver’s cancellation rate continues to exceed the maximum limit after multiple reminders, he may lose access.

 At a meeting with Uber and Ola managements and drivers on Monday, the Karnataka transport department said it will form a committee to set minimum fares to be charged by the aggregators. The panel will be formed by the end of the week, transport commissioner M K Aiyappa said. Maharashtra, too, has decided to fix a minimum fare.
 
 ‘Minimum fare against citizens’ interest’
 
 Uber India president Amit Jain said the company is against the government setting a floor on the minimum price as that goes against citizens’ right to have a cheaper service. “With a floor you are saying, even when you could have got a cheaper mode of service, you have to pay a higher fare.”
