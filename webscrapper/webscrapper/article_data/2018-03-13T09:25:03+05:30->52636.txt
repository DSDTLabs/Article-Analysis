Kolkata: The detective department has written to the   asking for details on the Indian cricket team’s travel plans, focusing on Mohammad Shami’s itinerary, during its just-concluded tour to South Africa. They have also seized the pacer’s phone, said sources close to development.

 
 
 “We have written to the board to ascertain Shami’s movements outside the country,” said joint CP (crime) Praveen Kumar Tripathy. Sources said that with families of both Shami and his wife   closing on an “amicable settlement”, the police want to be ready if the court seeks a report on the probe conducted so far.
 
 
 
 
 
 “Both sides are yet to approach court seeking a settlement. Hence, there is little question of letting our guards down,” said a source at Lalbazar. According to sources, Hasin had informed cops that Shami was to return home on February 16. Instead, he returned to India a day later. “This is one aspect on which we want a clarification from BCCI,” said a police source.
 
 
 
 
 
 As of now, sources said cops plan to complete all three legal procedures required at the beginning of the probe — forensically test the purported audio clips provided by Hasin as evidence, get Hasin’s statement recorded before a local magistrate and complete basic enquiries — before they take a decision on travelling to Moradabad to talk to Shami.
 
 
 
 
 
 Hasin’s lawyer reiterated that amicable talks between both sides continued on Monday. “We don’t have much to share for now,” said
