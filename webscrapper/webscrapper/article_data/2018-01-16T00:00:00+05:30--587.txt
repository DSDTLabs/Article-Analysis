Using   as a medium, the pass-outs of 1982 batch of Colvin Taluqdars’ College recently gathered for the second alumni meet after a two year of gap. It was an afternoon full of fun, food and frolic when the alumni first gathered at their alma mater for the photographs and refreshed their school memories, and later moved to a club at Kalidas Marg to party. "Three years ago we created a Whatsapp group of our batch in which everyone got connected gradually. Through that, most of the batch mates residing in different corners of the world collected here especially for this get-together," said Manjoosh Garg, admin of the group. 
With the 80's songs playing in the background, the ambience transported everyone back to their era and made them sing along the songs. While some were spotted laughing their souls out while discussing their class mischief, many in the groups were also seen recalling their school love stories.
 Priyadasrhi Verma, who visited Lucknow after 20 years and met his batch mates after 35 years, was quite excited. "It was a nostalgic moment for me as I am meeting my school friends after a long time. Many faces have changed and many looked same as they did during school days," shared Priyadarshi.
