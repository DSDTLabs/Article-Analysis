MUMBAI: Two   and a man were booked at   on Wednesday for allegedly trying to smuggle   concealed inside their  . This is a rare case where women have been caught for trying to smuggle gold in this manner.

 However, this is not the first time that these women, both widows, have tried to smuggle in gold using this method. They are repeat offenders who were paid between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 per trip.
 
 On Wednesday,   officials stopped Salochna Keshwani (60) and Mohini Lalawani (35) upon their arrival from Bangkok on suspicion. As the officials did not find anything on their person when they were frisked, one of them asked the duo to walk through a metal detector, which indicated that they were carrying metal items.
 
 When the officials questioned the two, they did not admit to the offence, though their replies were evasive. The officials decided to conduct a clinical examination, which confirmed that they had concealed 450gm of gold worth Rs 13.65 lakh in their rectums. They refused to admit to the crime despite the reported discovery.
 
 The officials found out from the women that both had children who depended on them financially. It was only after the officials told the two that they would bring their children to the   and tell them about their mothersâ€™ activities did they confess to the crime. They admitted to similarly   gold in the past as well.
 
 The customs department also booked their male associate, Akash Makhijani (35), who had concealed 270gm of gold worth Rs 8.2 lakh in his rectum. All three are Ulhasnagar residents. They admitted to working for a woman who lives in their neighbourhood, for a commission. 
 
 Officials said in recent past some of the passengers caught in gold smuggling cases have been from Ulhasnagar. The department therefore keeps a close watch on suspicious persons from the locality who make frequent trips abroad.
