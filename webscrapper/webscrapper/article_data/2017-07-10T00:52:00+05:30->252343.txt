Salem: Generation was stopped at the Mettur Thermal Power Plant (MTPP) on Saturday night after the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board generated more power through wind mills. Due to this, 600 MW of power generation was affected.

 MTPP officials said they were instructed by higher ups stop electricity generation. “We will again start generating electricity once we get the nod from higher officials,” said an MTPP official.
 
 Power production at the 200 MW Tunnel Power House and 40 MW Old Power House and 150 MW in the five barrages remained unaffected.
 
 The Tamil Nadu government had set up a new thermal power plant in Mettur at a cost of Rs 3,500 crore with a capacity to generate 600 MW along with the existing four thermal plants, which will produce 840 MW.
