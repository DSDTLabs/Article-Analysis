GUWAHATI: In an unexpected twist, top CID official  , who was heading the special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the Silapathar ransack case, was arrested on Thursday night. 

 The IPS officer is accused of providing vital information to a close aide of the key accused,  , who was sent to jail on Tuesday.
 
 A local court on Friday remanded Rajamarthandan, an SSP-rank official, in two-day police custody after a case was registered against him. He was suspended on Tuesday and quizzed by the city police’s crime branch the following day. Police commissioner   said, “Investigations have found several evidences against him.” 
 
 The Nikhil Bharat Bengali Udbastu Samannay Samiti (NBBUSS) had ransacked an office of the All Assam Students’ Union in Silapathar on March 6.
 
 Rajamarthandan had allegedly provided information about the ongoing investigation to one Ambika Roy, general secretary of NBBUSS, in the form of a reply to an   query (by Roy).
 
 “The CID doesn’t come under the ambit of RTI until it’s related to violation of human rights. Moreover, he did not consult his colleagues and seniors and allegedly provided the information taking advantage of his position,” a source in CID said.
 
 Sources claimed that call records of the officer have revealed that he contacted NBBUSS members recently.
