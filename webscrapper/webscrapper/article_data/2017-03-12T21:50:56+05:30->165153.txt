GURGAON:   was spot on about the winning score of 10-under but he never imagined making the championship-delivering putt on the 18th hole on Sunday afternoon. "I still can't believe it," said a shivering champion, who hadn't anticipated a liquid celebration near the grandstand. Perhaps he shouldn't underestimate himself. In the zone, keeping it simple, playing measured shots and converting opportunities whenever he needed to summon the trusty putter on all four days, SSP saw what the others didn't - a guide to playing this tricky Gary Player course - and executed it to perfection with an emphatic 7-stroke defence of the $1.75m Hero  . There will be mistakes but the key is to minimize them by respecting the course and with scores of 72, 67, 68 and a final 71, he managed to steadily consolidate.

  
  
 In the end, it was a battle within himself at the DLF G&CC. His playing partners who were supposed to push him returned overpar rounds.   with a three-over 75 finished 7 strokes behind in second place and   with a 6-over 78 saw his challenge dissipate slowly as he finished tied-fifth with Rafa Cabrera Bello and Anirban Lahiri. Lahiri closed with a 67 and 71 to jump into a favourable position in a tournament where only seven golfers finished with sup-par totals.
 
 But it was all about SSP. His calm appearance was deceptive, the 38-year-old said later he had butterflies in the stomach. "I felt nervous but tried to relax. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to play this golf course," he said, wrapping a towel around him.
 
 He did stall on speedbreakers bogeys on 6th and 7th but immediately made amends with a couple of birdies. "I was on the borderline, I had to get serious, stay focused." Having built a sizeable lead as others continued to drop shots, pars were of the utmost importance. "I just told myself, make pars, make pars, please make pars." Eight holes went without much incident, an assuring birdie on the 13th added to his confidence. After the tee shot on the 18th, he breathed a little having understood the task he had accomplished. He could afford to concede a bogey to register "the best win" of his career on a "very tough" course and a fat $291,660 cheque.
 
 There were many doubters, though. Length was supposed to be an important factor this week with the back nine measuring almost 4,000 yards from the back tees. Chawrasia was 195th out of 196 in driving distance on the European Tour with avg of 260.5yards. Money was on the Europeans in this unfamiliar territory but little did anyone know how to negotiate the narrow fairways flanked by small bushes, wide bunkers and massive water bodies. Having stuck to the game plan of playing regulation golf like everyone does at the tree-lined Delhi Golf Club, he became the first Indian to defend a European Tour title.
 
 Back early morning to finish his third round, he strung together a hat-trick of birdies to go two clear of Carlos Pigem with a four-under going into the final round. "I feel great honestly. Just trying to save my shots and not make bogeys. That's the goal when I came out this morning. It's a long day."
 
 It was long, he had to give the customary interviews and satisfy the growing demands of young fans. He may or may not have missed his evening flight to Kolkata or even found a change of shirt but it was all worth it.
