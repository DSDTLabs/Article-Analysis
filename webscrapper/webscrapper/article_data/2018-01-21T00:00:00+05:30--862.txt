 loves indulging fiancée  , and his latest gift, according to her, has been by far the best ever. “Rakshit loves pampering me but his latest gesture took me by surprise completely. I love animals, so for the new year, Rakshit bought me a cute kitten. I had no idea he had been planning this for me and was really overwhelmed when Rakshit gave him to me,” says Rashmika. A self-confessed dog person,   says this is her first-ever cat and it has now become the Mandanna family’s favourite. “He’s been named   and I take him everywhere I go. My sister loves squishing him, so Simba runs away at the sight of her. Otherwise, he’s really well behaved,” shares the actor. Rashmika is shortly slated to leave for Hyderabad for the promotions of her Telugu film and Simba will accompany her there, too. “He is such good company and is a wonderful stress buster. I can’t do without him around me,” she sums up.
