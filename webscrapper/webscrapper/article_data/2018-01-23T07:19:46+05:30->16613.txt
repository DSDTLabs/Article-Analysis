Bengaluru traffic police have turned over-zealous with their crackdown on substandard helmets by suggesting that ones that meet global standards - such as United States' DoT and Europe's ECE - are not acceptable. Only riders who wear ISI-marked helmets will not be penalized when the rule comes into force from February 1, police said. 

 Replying to a tweet last week, police had at first suggested that helmets ratified by DoT and ECE - which are approved by the  , the body that issues   certification - are legal. However, R  , additional commissioner of police (traffic), told TOI: "We will not accept such helmets. We will only accept those with an ISI mark." 
 
  This effectively means riders of luxury bikes such as   or Triumph, who wear helmets priced over Rs 15,000, will now have to sport an ISI-marked helmet. 
 
 Meanwhile, cashing in on the drive, housing minister M Krishnappa and his MLA-son, Priya Krishna, will distribute ISI-standard helmets free of charge at an event in Vijayanagar on January 26.
