NEW DELHI: Due to reports of various malpractices during the ongoing   exam, the authorities have decided to postpone the second leg of the examination. According to an official statement issued by the Rajasthan Police, the exams which are scheduled from March 20 to March 31 have been postponed.

 
 
 The Rajasthan police had invited application for 5390 vacancies for constables. As per the notification there were 4684 vacancies for general constables, 402 for general constables - TSP/Sahria Area and 304 for Constables (Driver).
 
 Meanwhile, Rajasthan's special operation group (SOG) had so far arrested 21 people for facilitating cheating during the Rajasthan police constable recruitment exam, an official said.
 
 Two key accused of a gang that cloned thumbprints of candidates and sent proxies to write the exam were arrested, Additional Director General (SOG)   said. In a separate cheating racket case, three accused, including prime accused and centre director were also arrested today, Mishra said.
 
 "It was found that the gang made a thumbprint impression of the original candidate and pasted it on the thumb of the proxy who took the exam.
 
 "It was also learnt that they used some oil to make the fake thumbprint last for at least one hour. Candidates managed to cheat the biometric attendance system," Mishra said.
