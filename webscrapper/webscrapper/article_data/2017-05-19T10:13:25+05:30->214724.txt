KOLHAPUR: On the backdrop of Aurangabad’s incident earlier this week, the Shivaji University, Kolhapur (SUK) officials have told TOI that they will maintain   and regulations  

 “Security has always been the top priority for SUK. We have issued strict instructions to the colleges and officials engaged in the examination process,” said an SUK official.
 
 Director of board of examinations and evaluation, Mahesh Kakade on Thursday said that the incident that took place in Aurangabad was indeed shameful.
 
 “We have always been vigilant. We have issued circulars and instructions with principal of different colleges regarding this issue. I must say the incident that happened last week was rare,” he said.
 
 “During the summer exams last year, SUK had set up an answer book distribution centre where answer sheets were collected after exam and not stored in the colleges. The barcoded answer sheets were then distributed to the Central Assessment Program (CAP). We did not receive a single complaint against any kind of malpractices,” he added.
 
 The Aurangabad police on Wednesday raided a local   corporator's residence where the blank answer sheets of civil engineering exam paper held a day earlier were being filled with answers taken from textbooks and other material.
 
 33 people, including 27 second-year students of the   of Engineering and Technology and teachers, were arrested from corporator Sitaram Sure's house.
