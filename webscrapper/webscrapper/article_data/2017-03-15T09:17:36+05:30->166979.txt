CHENNAI: Three   for 17 days in a sealed house at Sourashtra Nagar, Choolaimedu, were rescued by   on Tuesday. 

 The house had been sealed on February 25 after the house owner failed to repay the loan he had taken from a private finance company and the company approached the officials concerned. 
 
 Blue Cross general manager   said the dogs were in a dehydrated condition due to non availability of drinking water. After coming to know of their plight, Williams lodged a complaint with the Choolaimedu police. A team of personnel immediately went to the private finance company office. A couple of employees from ther firm then accompanied the police team to the house where they scaled the wall of the house and brought out the dogs one by one. Despite being cooped up inside for so long, the dogs appeared very friendly, Williams said.
 
 However, as they were being taken out, the house owner came to the spot and created a ruckus. He wanted the seal to be broken to take the dogs out. Officials of the finance company, however, did not want to do so.
 
 Throughout their long stay in the locked house, Williams said, compassionate people in the neighbourhood fed the dogs every day. But they were unable to provide water due to which they were dehydrated, he added.
 
 Some residents in the locality said the dogs went through hell, particularly at night when they would let plaintive wails, causing a major disturbance to people living nearby. It was after a senior citizen living on the same street gave a written request to the   general manager that the dogs were rescued.
 
 After their rescue, the dogs were taken to the Blue Cross shelter in Velachery. They were given a thorough wash and ticks found all over their bodies were removed. It will take some time for the dogs to get back to their normal health, Williams added.
