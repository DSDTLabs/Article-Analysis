GURUGRAM:   residents have written to the chief minister again seeking his intervention in expediting the   takeover of the residential colony. 

 They will also take out a rally against the civic body outside Hotel Marriott in Sushant Lok-1 on Sunday morning as part of a series of protests they have planned till the government gives them a timeline for takeover of the area from developer Ansal API Limited.
 
 They had organised a similar   in February too.
 
 The letter that was sent to the chief minister’s office on Wednesday last week stated that the residents have been running from pillar to post meeting officials from the MCG, department of town and country planning and other government functionaries, only to be told that the takeover would be possible following an amendment in the state legislative assembly. 
 
 “Despite the chief minister and the former deputy commissioner promising us repair of roads, nothing has been done yet,” said Neelu Sharma, a Sushant Lok resident, who has been coordinating with the government officials in the matter. In February too, the residents had written a letter to the CM, which failed to get an appropriate response from the authorities. The letter highlighted the deplorable conditions Sushant Lok-1 residents were living in in the wake of lack of any infra work undertaken, either by the developer or the civic body. 
 
 MCG officialss said they could not take up any infra work unless the takeover was complete.
