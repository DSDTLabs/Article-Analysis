 Being from a business family, I always look to optimise my time. I enjoy my work and I’ve never seen it from a ‘9-5’ perspective. I just give it what it takes. I try to get work out for at least two to three days in a week in the gym. Travelling takes up a lot of my time but when home (Mumbai), I make sure I’m with my family. 
 
  
 
  My highest energy comes out when things are the toughest. I love challenges, exploring new things, fitness and sport. I get an intense energy boost when I’m playing a sport. 
 
  
 
  Taking very high risks. I like taking up challenges, chasing tough targets and setting high goals. The way I see it, one has ‘x’ amount of time – and you could use it to take up strong challenges that can make a difference inyour life and in this world.
 
  
 
  No tricks – I believe in simple straight objectivity – and leave a sweetener, always. Be ‘immersive’; never do stuff to simply achieve the goal. It’s the manner in which one achieves it that decides the outcome. Everything must have passion, commitment and thought.
 
  You say ‘no to... I have a hard time saying ‘no’ in general. But I’m a stickler for systems and processes.
 
  
 
  Slow down, breathe and take more time out for myself. Be more grateful for everything I have.
 
  
 
  Diving (at least once a year).
 
  
 
  You win or you learn. There’s nothing like failure.
 
  
 
  Be objective and immersive – be simple. And don’t try pleasing everyone.
 
  
 
  Gym = therapy.
