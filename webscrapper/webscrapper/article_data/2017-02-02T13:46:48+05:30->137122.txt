Actress Vahbbiz Dorabjee, who plays the role of   on the show "Bahu Humari Rajni_kant", recently took a break from her shoot to enjoy the wedding festivities of her brother Daniel. While Vahbiz's friends from the TV industry attended the functions, it was husband and   actor  , who went missing from all the ceremonies. 
 
 There are reports that the actor wasn't invited by Vahbiz's family, further fuelling rumours that the couple is headed for splitsville. Vahbiz and Vivian have been living separately for over four months now and hence, this news doesn't come as a surprise. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reports of trouble in their paradise began in the month of September, and the possible reasons for their split became a fodder for gossip.
  
 While talking about the same to TOI last year, Vivian had said, "Every couple goes through compatibility issues. And in our case, we are two radically different people â€” she being a social person and I, asocial. But then again, opposites attract. However, we are not yet done with each other, we have just taken a break. Divorce is out of question. Vahbbiz and I will make our marriage work."
  
 With how things are headed, it seems that the couple hasn't been able to resolve their differences.
