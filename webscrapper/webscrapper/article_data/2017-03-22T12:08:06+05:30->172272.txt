Yeah! That's right. All those of us who thought that the ' ' actor   and cup-song fame   were dating, the announcement of their film came as a huge surprise. 
The two young actors will be seen romancing each other in Varun Narvekar’s debut directorial venture – ' '.
 
 Amey first announced the film in a cryptic way when he posted a picture of the Mithila and himself sipping chai on Valentine’s Day. He had even captioned it as, “Finally <3 #myvalentine”, sending social media and gossip columnists in a tizzy. 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  Yesterday the actor updated his status on Facebook, “Mala surprise dyaychay tula Mithila Palkar..udya sakali 11 vajta Facebook bagh ;)” (I want to surprise you Mithila Palkar check Facebook tomorrow at 11 am.)
 
 Of course, not only Mithila, but everyone waited for Amey to reveal the surprise. Turns out it was the announcement that the two of them were, in fact, dating in a film. “Here is the surprise.. 
 
  
  
 
  Me and Mithila Palkar are dating "in a film". We are a couple "in a film". Yes.. I am single... but Im completely in love with this film. For all those who thought we look good as a couple... Here is a small gift for you this summer. Its called मुरांबा! :),” (sic) wrote Amey. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Mithila too uploaded the same picture with a caption that read, "For all the hearts that were broken and shall now be mended - Presenting to you the first look of our film "मुरांबा" with my on screen valentine Amey Wagh. Here's the surprise that you all were so impatiently waiting for." 
 
 Here's the poster of the film.
