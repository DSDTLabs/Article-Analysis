Chennai: Actor Rajinikanth, who is readying himself for the role of a politician, visited former minister and close associate of AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran R M Veerappan in his residence on Thursday.

 Veerappan, who has had a long association with  , is considered a well-wisher of the superstar. Veerappan’s closeness with the actor had cost him his ministership twice during the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK government (1991-1996). Veerappan was first dropped as minister in 1992 as Jayalalithaa suspected him of allying with Rajinikanth to bring her down.
 
 At the ‘Baasha’ success event in 1995, Rajini, criticised the Jayalalithaa government for “failing to contain the bomb culture” that had taken root in Tamil Nadu. Veerappan, who produced the hit film, was on stage when Rajini made the controversial remark. As a result, chief minister Jayalalithaa removed her from the cabinet. Veerappan had been serving as the animal husbandry minister. Veerappan went on to found the MGR Kazhagam party. The 91-year old politician earlier served as the information minister in MGR’s cabinet.
 
 Following the death of MGR in 1987, Veerappan opposed Jayalalithaa and sided with the widowed Janaki. Rajinikanth consulted Veerappan, a day after meeting DMK chief M Karunanidhi.
