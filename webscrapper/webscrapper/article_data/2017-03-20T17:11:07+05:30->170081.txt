Bollywood is abuzz with news of 
  collaborating with director  . The director is expected to begin work on the film once he wraps up 
 -starrer ‘Tubelight’. The obvious next question is – who will be the leading lady in the Hrithik-starrer? Well, if recent reports are to be believed, 
  and 
  are the two names that are being considered for the project. 

 Hrithik has worked with Katrina in the past – the two shared screen space in ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’ and ‘Bang Bang’. The duo was appreciated for their sizzling chemistry on both occasions. Kat also shook a leg to the dance number ‘Chikni Chameli’ in Hrithik’s 2012 hit ‘Agneepath’.
 
 On the other hand, the actor has not teamed up with Deepika in his career so far. So if the two do indeed collaborate, it will be a fresh pairing to watch out for.
 
 So which of the two actresses will finally make the cut? Guess we’ll have to wait and watch.
