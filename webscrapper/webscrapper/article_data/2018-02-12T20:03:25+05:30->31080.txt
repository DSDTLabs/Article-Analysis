MUMBAI: The alacrity shown by two traffic cops helped a British national get back his   within half an hour after he forgot it in a taxi at Breach Candy. The cops enlisted the help of a teenager who owned a handset of the same make and could install a software to track the Britisher, Yakub Goga's, lost phone. Goga was overjoyed to get his phone back, the police said. 

 Goga, a 50-something businessman, has lived in the UK for the last three decades. On Friday evening, he and three of his relatives were out shopping. Around 5.15pm, Goga approached a police team from Tardeo traffic outpost for help to find the phone. He told the cops that the phone contained vital data and it was probably in the back seat of a taxi they had taken. "Ordinarily, one has to go to the police station and file a complaint in such a case. But we took a chance and tried to track the phone," said constable Deepak Sangle. 
 
 A lost iPhone can be tracked by installing a certain app on another iDevice. "Goga spoke to his brother in the UK who told him that the phone's location was  . We figured that the taxi, with the phone in it, was mobile. "We enquired with passers-by if anyone owned an iPhone. It turned out that a 17-year-old boy, Ankit Kothari, who was out with his family, did." 
 
 From Malabar Hill, the cab location moved to   and then to Shalimar restaurant. Sangle got on his bike and Kothari and Goga joined him to look for the phone. The idea was that Kothari would give them the location and Goga would identify the taxi driver once they located the taxi.
