PUNE: City lad   (22) was among 17 students responsible for designing and building the solar power and battery systems for satellite EQUiSat, which was successfully launched into orbit by   last week.

 
 Lalwani is working as an engineering research assistant at   (Ivy League) and had recently graduated from the university with BSc Honours in engineering physics. He is also a member of Tau Beta Pi Society, the engineering honor society. He was chosen as the group leader of the project after being selected for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) student-led programme.
 
 A statement issued by Lalwani stated that the team’s project was funded by CubeSat Launch Initiative, a special initiative of Nasa for the students. It sent the 4-inch cube satellite and then successfully launched it into the orbit on May 20 from Wallops Island, Virginia, US on Antares rocket to the International Space Station. 
 
 The power team led by Lalwani not only built solar panels from scratch, but also ensured that they survived the launch process. The team also came up with a coating and the means to protect the delicate panels of the satellite.
 
 “EQUiSat is one of the most economical satellites developed by students,” the statement said. The average cost of a satellite like EQUiSat ranges from $50,000-$100,000. However, the team managed to create the satellite for less than $4,000. “We tried several protocols for about 12 months and failed consistently. Finally, being able to fix the coating was one of the many big accomplishments of Brown Space Engineering,” Lalwani said in the statement.
 
 EQUiSat will test lithium iron phosphate batteries, which are used in machines like lawn mowers, but find limited applications in spacecrafts. Lalwani did his schooling from   in Pune and higher education from Mahindra United World College, Pune. He plans to continue his research on solar energy and pursue PhD at Stanford.
