NEW DELHI: The intense pressure mounted by the income tax department post-demonetisation has prompted several of those under scrutiny to opt for the Pradhan Mantri   (PMGKY). 

 The government had unveiled the PMGKY to offer a “last” opportunity to holders of unaccounted-for wealth to come clean. The scheme will be available up to March 31. Those who declare unaccounted-for cash under the scheme will be levied a charge of 50% (30% tax, 33% surcharge and 10% penalty). A declarant will also have to deposit 25% of the undisclosed income in the PMGK deposit scheme.
 
 Over the past two days, the Pune investigation directorate conducted surveys and searches on 37 jewellers in 16 cities across   and detected serious irregularities. Sources in the tax department said several of those who had come under scrutiny are believed to have opted for the tax amnesty scheme. 
 
 Since  , the I-T department has stepped up pressure to ensure that   holders do not go scot free. Several search and survey operations carried out across the country have revealed large-scale irregularities. Investigations by the I-T authorities in Hyde-rabad have shown that those facing the heat from the tax department may prefer to opt for the PMGKY, sources said.
 
 A prominent jeweller had deposited cash exceeding Rs 100 crore in the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Tax department sources said that he identified the source of cash as advances from customers who purchased jewellery on the night of November 8. Tax officials found the claims to be wrong and the matter was referred to the ED and some of the accused were arrested. Similarly, a doctor’s bank account showed a cash deposit of Rs 11.50 crore, and he admitted that the cash was from unexplained sources. The department has seized the balance of Rs 7.5 crore, sources said.
