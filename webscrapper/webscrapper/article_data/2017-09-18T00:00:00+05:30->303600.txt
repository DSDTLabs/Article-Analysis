 of   is proud to be associated with   since its inception. “Firstly, The   is the most read paper and for them to take up such an initiative to honour and recognize the unsung heroes is commendable,” says Vijay.
He further says that this kind of an event didn’t exist where every single technician category was honoured. “There are so many different deparments who work behind a film. For the audience, they only know the director, producer and actors who collect awards as the faces of the film. They easily criticize the films they watch pointing fingers at different aspects. An event like this will make them understand the many departments that are there in a film. It was time that all these technicians got their due,” adds Vijay, saying that it will be a special moment for them to see their photographs on the newspaper as opposed to the people on screen that are usually used when writing or talking about a film.
