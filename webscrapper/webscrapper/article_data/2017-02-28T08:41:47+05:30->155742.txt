BENGALURU:   are among the least studied large carnivores in the world. Found in dense  , they are difficult to capture and   for tracking their movements and studying their behaviour. However, probably for the first time in India, researchers have been able to estimate the home range (area in which they roam) of dholes in the Western Ghats using camera traps. 

 As per the findings, dholes generally roam in a large area of 85 sqkm in search of food or mates. Scientists from Wildlife Conservation Society (India Programme), Centre for Wildlife Studies, and  , USA, tracked two marked dholes for 45 days and recorded their movements. The study, based on intensive camera-trap surveys, was conducted in Nagarahole and Wayanad wildlife reserves.
 
 Lead author of the study,  , who is a doctoral student at the University of Florida says, “Typically, radio-telemetry is used to obtain information on the home range of large carnivores such as dholes. This is expensive and requires careful handling of the animals. In contrast, our estimates are generated through innovative use of non-invasive and relatively inexpensive camera-trap pictures”.
 
 The researchers’ set up and monitored camera traps, which yielded incidental photographic material. Unlike tigers or leopards, individual dholes can not be uniquely identified from camera-trap photographs because they don’t have pelage patterns or natural body markings. Yet the researchers were able to identify two individuals in a pack of five animals, based on distinct markings on their pelage, enabling them to map locations of the pack during the survey period.
