HYDERABAD: Nizamabad MP   came down strongly on the BJP for making a mountain out of a molehill over a gaffe made by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao while referring to Prime Minister  . 

 
 Kavitha came to the defence of her father, a day after her brother and IT minister   offered an explanation to defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who was in the city. The BJP had taken exception to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao using a particular Telugu word that shows disrespect to a person.
 
 "Prime minister Narendra Modi claimed in Davos that he was elected by 600 crore people when the population of India is 130 crore. Did we make an issue out of that? One must have an open mind to understand what is a slip of the tongue," she commented. 
 
 Kavitha said   had spoken at a meeting for one hour and 20 minutes and addressed a lot of things. "He did not mean to insult the Prime Minister. It was a slip of the tongue. Insulting the Prime Minister means we are insulting ourselves. The BJP has no serious issues to talk about, so it is trying to make a big issue out of a small slip of the tongue," Kavitha said.
