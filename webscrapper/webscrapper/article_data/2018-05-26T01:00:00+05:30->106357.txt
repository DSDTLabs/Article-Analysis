 The veteran indie band, back almost after a hiatus of seven years have truly got something special for their fans this time. The fruit of their labour is the album called 'Wildness' with 10 tracks that show just why the band deserves their stardom. The starting track, ' ' is what classic music is made of. It starts slow and unveils in the most amazing manner possible. With a video set in a space station, the song has the band taking a step back and observing human life in all its myriad forms. 
 
 The third track, 'Heal Me', is a hopeful ballad that goes a bit fast where   experiments a little with his singing style. A personal song, it deals with themes of addiction and recovery. Another glorious track is 'What If This Is All the Love You Ever Get'. A gut-wrenching song, it has all the potential to heal a badly done break-up. ' ' is a song brimming with positivity and hope; something we all require in huge doses.
 
 The writing on 'Wildness' by Lightbody is phenomenal. It seems he was suffering from writer’s block, and it was songs on this album that ended it. It’s heartening to see work that is not bogged down by cynicism and misanthropy. While there are more serious themes like ageing and death, they are handled in the most sensitive manner. If you like the old school Snow Patrol-vibe, then this is the album that will have you hooked for sure.
