JHANSI: Protests by right-wing organisations ensued after over a dozen cows were found lying dead because of starvation on Thursday on   in  , which is situated about 65km from  . 

 As the news about the deaths spread, members of various Hindu outfits gathered on the spot to protest and even blocked the highway for a couple of hours. Not far away from the scene, an equal number of cows were seen starving in a roadside farm. Locals said the cows had been surviving without fodder and water for the past couple of days.
 
 The protesters alleged that despite ample number of cow shelters and facilities for fodder and water, these cows have been left to starve and the administration's negligence was to be blamed for the deaths. SDM Mauranipur, Sunil Kumar Shukla, said, "The excessive heat and shortage of water may be the cause behind the deaths." He also said the prevailing tradition of 'Anna Pratha' in this region may also have led to these deaths. As per the tradition, farmers let loose their cattle if they are unable to provide them fodder and water. 
 
 The protesters dispersed only after the administration's assurances. Later, a mass grave was dug to bury the dead cows. The starving animals were transferred to a nearby cow shelter, where they are being treated by a veterinary doctor. Jhansi district magistrate AK Shukla, said, "I have ordered a detailed enquiry into the matter which is being headed by SDM. We are also ensuring proper treatment to the sick cows".
