HUBBALLI: People in   were deprived of the   on “Makara Sankramana” as water level at the  , the main source of drinking water to the twin cities, reducing drastically. The ritual was badly hit as the situation is pathetic in most of the   in the region. Usually, people visit reservoirs, ponds and dams to take dip during Sankranti.

 People of the twin cities celebrated Sankranti at Unkal Lake garden, where the water level is shrinking due to hyacinth and weed. They exchanged sesame and jaggery and later shared the food brought from home at the lake. Many farmers visited their fields and farms along with food in their bull-carts. People also wished each other on the occasion.
 
 Except Kudalasangama, other major waterbodies in North Karnataka are also facing the same problem. According to Dr Veeranna Madlur, medical officer of primary health centre, Krishna and Malaprabha catchment areas have received sufficient rain this year. “Moreover, the authorities have released water from Almatti and Navilutirtha dam for Sankranti. Thousands of people have followed the ritual of holy dip at Kudalasangam and thereafter had darshan of Basavanna on the occasion,” he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, people who visited Hampi, were disappointed because Tungabhadra river had just knee-deep water. At some places, it was completely dry. Since catchment areas have received very little rainfall this year, the water in Tungabhadra river receded in January itself. “I have been visiting Hampi every Makara Sankranti since several years, but I never met this poor condition of water. I am very disappointed due to the lack of water for holy dip this year,” said Venkatesh Naidu from Adhoni, Andhra Pradesh.
 
 Mohan Chikkabhat Joshi, a priest, informed that there were fewer devotees on Makara Sankranti this year. “Water scarcity is the main reason for this poor turnout,” he said.
