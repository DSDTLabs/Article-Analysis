JALANDHAR:  , who was termed as   (KCF) terrorist by deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal stayed at his house in Moga for a night a couple of days back, has said that Sukhbir and Punjab Congress chief Capt Amarinder Singh were branding him as a terrorist only to defame Kejriwal.

 In a video message posted from the UK on social media, Gurinder said he would come back to Punjab and would file a defamation suit against those who were terming him a terrorist. He also asked Sukhbir, who also holds home department, why was he not arrested if he was such a big terrorist when he was staying in Punjab for four and a half years. 
 
 He also challenged the deputy CM to produce even a single FIR against him except the one case in which he was acquitted by court. Gurinder said he was not involved in the Bagha Purana blast, which took place in September 1997, and his name was included in the FIR in April 1998 by the then SHO. He said he had to stay away from India for seven years as he was in the UK and then he was declared a proclaimed offender. Gurinder said he returned to India in 2004 and appeared in the court and was found innocent and acquitted. “I was rather a victim as my mother died when I was still in the UK. I could not see her when she was in the hospital.”
 
 Gurinder further said, “They are talking rubbish against me. Let them produce even a single FIR before or after this case. I’ll sue all those for defamation who are spreading canards against me.”
 
 He claimed that while he did not meet any AAP leader, Kejriwal stayed in his house after a friend arranged for it. He also added that Congress candidate and MLA from Bagha Purana Darshan Singh also stayed at his house. He said several senior SAD) leaders were known to him and had been meeting him. “Sukhbir and Amarinder are defaming me as they fear defeat in the assembly election,” he added.
