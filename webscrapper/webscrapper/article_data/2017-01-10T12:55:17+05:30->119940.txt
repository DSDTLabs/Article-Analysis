PATNA: A woman and her two minor children came under the wheels of Danapur-Sahebganj   while crossing the railway tracks near Pandarak railway station in Patna district on Monday morning.   sources said the deceased were trying to cross the tracks as a nearby underpass was filled with mud.

 Police and district administration officials rushed to the spot as locals created a ruckus due to which several trains on New Delhi- Howrah route were delayed. The deceased were identified as Champa Devi (32), Kiran Kumari (5) and Ravi Ranjan (1).
 
 “They were crossing the railway tracks near an underpass on the eastern side of Pandarak station. The underpass is filled with mud, hence they did not go through it. Champa’s husband and their first son had already crossed the tracks. Kiran was behind them without realizing that Sahebganj Intercity was coming from the east side. In a bid to save her daughter, Champa ran behind her with her youngest son in hand. However, they were killed as it was running at its normal speed owing to no stoppage at  ,”   SP Jitendra Mishra told TOI.
 
 While it took a few hours for the local administration and rail Police to control the agitating locals on the tracks, the bodies were sent for postmortem. “The district administration has been asked to clear the mud in the underpass near Pandarak station, so that people use it and such accidents are avoided,” said Mishra.
 
 The incidents of people getting run down by trains have been frequent despite repeated insistence by railways to avoid walking on the tracks. Three workers were recently mowed down by a running train on Gaya- Mughalsarai route in Aurangabad district.
