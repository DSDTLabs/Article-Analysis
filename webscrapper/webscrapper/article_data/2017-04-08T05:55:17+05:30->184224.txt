ROHTAK: Witnessing 4,800 cases of unfair means of copying (UMC), including impersonation, across the state during classes X and XII exams this year, the Board of School Education, Haryana (BSEH) is mulling to introduce biometric verification of candidates through information provided on Aadhaar card.

 BSEH chairman   said the students who had not updated their Aadhaar cards on the board website would not be issued mark sheets in the current session.
 
 The state school board had formed 327 anti-cheating flying squads to tackle the menace of mass copying and impersonation in the exams. It also relieved 103 invigilators and 12 supervisors for being negligent in their duties during the conduct of exams based on the evidence against them.
 
 On March 7, the anti-flying squads of the BSEH had caught three fake teachers performing duties of government teachers who had hired them at Bohar village of Rohtak district.
 
 On Thursday, the BSEH chairman raided two marking centres in Bhiwani and found 50% of the staff missing from duty. He also raided a marking centre on Hansi road in Bhiwani on Friday and found 59 out of 66 teachers absent from duty.
 
 The board has sought an action against absentee teachers for not taking their job seriously from the state education department.
 
 Jagbir Singh said their efforts were to set an example before wrongdoers to think twice before committing offences and thus so many UMC cases were registered. "Like cheating, impersonation is a common practice and our flying squads caught many persons appearing for some other candidates but they generally escaped from the spot by pushing away the raiding staff," he said.
