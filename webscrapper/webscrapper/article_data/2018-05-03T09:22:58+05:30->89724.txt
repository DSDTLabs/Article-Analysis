VADODARA: If you plan to visit J P Road police station, make it sure that you are dressed from head to toe. Forget getting police help, you won’t even get an entry into the police station

 The J P Road police has put up posters asking citizens to not enter the police station wearing shorts. The posters written in Gujarati are pasted right at the entry of the police station.
 
 When asked for the reason behind such order, V R Khair, JP Road police sub-inspector (PSI), told TOI, “We get lot of visitors everyday and many of them come in casual clothes. As the temperatures are soaring due to summers, people, especially men, also walk in the police station wearing shorts. There were a couple of instances when some men came to the police station wearing too skimpy shorts.”
 
 “They sat indecently on the chair. We have women cops here who felt embarrassed due to such incidents. I got complaints from the women police, following which we discussed the issue. We then decided to disallow shorts inside the police station premises,” Khair said.
 
 According to Khai, people have to understand how to behave in public places.
 
 The police said that the rule applies to both men and women. If someone walks in at the police station in shorts, the staff has been asked to tell him or her politely to wear full clothes and come. “It is just to maintain discipline in the police station,” Khair said.
