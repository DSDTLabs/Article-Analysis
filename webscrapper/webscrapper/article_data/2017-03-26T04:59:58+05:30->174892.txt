NEW DELHI: Delhi police has sought the video footage of MP   abusing the Air India staffer on the stepladder of the aircraft during which he had allegedly tried to push him off. 

 In the FIR, the employee R Sukumar has mentioned that he was pushed four or five times by the MP with the intention to throw him off the ladder. Gaikwad had even admitted to this in a television interview later. 
 
 In the FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, Sukumar said the ground crew had received information that a passenger on the Pune-Delhi flight had refused to deboard. The passenger, who later identified himself as an MP, demanded a meeting with the Air India CEO for not allotting him a business class ticket. Air India officials said all business class tickets were converted to economy and Gaikwad’s PA was informed about it. 
 
 When flight manager Sukumar tried to convince the MP to deboard, he grew aggressive. “I had started talking in English, but he insisted on speaking in Hindi. He then started using abusive languages (sic) against the crew,” said Sukumar in the FIR.
