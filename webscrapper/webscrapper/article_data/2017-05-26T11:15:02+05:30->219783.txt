 The 31-year-old songstress said she feels fortunate to have the   frontwoman on the track 'Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems' from her new LP.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 "She (Nicks) was amazing. She was everything you hope she's gonna be. She's so contemporary, and she knows all the new   that's out weekly. She loved the track and she added so much to it," said   . 
 
 The 'High By The Beach' singer said she always felt the album needed another female voice. 
 
 "I kind of thought I had finished the record a couple of times, and then one of those times I really felt like I wanted a woman on the record. "
 
 "I was talking to my producer, Rick Nowels, about who would be great to get on the record, and we both could only come up with Stevie," said Lana Del Rey .
