RAJKOT: A special team of city police has begun investigation into the FIR alleging custodial death of small-time bootlegger   lodged by his father Devraj after massive protests by the Patidar community in his support.

 Police commissioner   told TOI that one police inspector, two police sub inspectors and five policemen will assist MJ Solanki, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters) who has been given the probe.
 
 “The team has started taking statements of Lunagariya‘s family members,” Gehlot said.
 
 Lunagariya (35) and another criminal   (19) were killed on January 1 in what police claimed to be a clash among five persons near Aji river over robbed booty. 
 
 Lunagariya’s is a queer case of murder where two persons including deceased Zala and Yuvrajsinh Zala have been named as accused in one complaint and ‘unidentified’ policemen in the second complaint lodged by his father.
 
 Yuvrajsinh, Prakash Parmar and Kadar Malek have been named as accused in Shaktisinh‘s murder and their police remand ends Saturday.
 
 When asked about the case against these three accused, Gehlot said that they are collecting evidence in this regard and police could take call at an appropriate time. 
 
 Sources said that questioning and statements of Malek, Yuvrajsinh and Parmar would play a ‘key’ role in unravelling the mystery behind the alleged custodial deaths and sequence of events that led to the deaths.
