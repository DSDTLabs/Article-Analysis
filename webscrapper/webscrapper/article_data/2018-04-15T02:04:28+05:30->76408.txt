NEW DELHI: The   may have got some   from the   off late, but   from the  . While the city has already recorded 25   and eight chikungunya cases, experts have predicted that mosquito-borne disease cases may rise even before the monsoon this year. 

 The temperature during the winter did not drop below 16 degrees Celsius for a long period to hinder mosquito breeding and virus transmission, they explained.
 
 Chetan Sharma, the general secretary of Confederation of NCR RWAs, said the mosquito menace had not only arrived early this year, the magnitude was also severe. “No fogging has been carried out in our area. All these claims of action are only restricted to corporation files,” he said.
 
 After the Delhi high court on Wednesday rapped the government for their “complete insensitivity” in controlling vector-borne diseases, LG Anil Baijal held a meeting on Friday to check the administration’s preparedness to fight the menace. 
 
 The civic bodies, however, argued that the diseases were under control and people should not panic as most of the cases in Delhi hospitals were from outside.
 
 The increased mosquito population doesn’t belong to the Aedes aegypti breed that causes dengue and chikungunya but the kind that is mere nuisance, claimed a north corporation official. “The commissioner has said erring staff would be suspended and increments would be held back. They may also be demoted,” he said.
 
 The south corporation has preponed the anti-mosquito programme by two months and two new insecticides would be introduced to tackle the mosquitoes which have developed resistance. 
 
 The corporations claim domestic breeding checkers have already made 51 lakh visits this year and over 52,000 houses have been sprayed. They have found 2,293 homes as violating the norms and 167 cases have been filed — 152 by  , nine by the north and six by the east corporation.
