CHENNAI: Rajya Sabha member and BJP leader   on Sunday exhorted Tamil Nadu Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao to decide by Monday on the issue of who will be the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu â€“ whether CM O Pennerselvam or AIADMK general secretary V K   . 

 "If not, it is possible to file a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution for abetment of  ," tweeted Swamy, leading twitterati to speculate that he was siding with the Sasikala faction of the AIADMK and advising them to take action against the TN Governor.
 
 Swamy also mentioned former attorney general of India Soli Sorabjee in his tweets. "Glad to see Soli Sorabjee has come over to the same view as me: "Guv cannot delay for long." Now every top legal eagle is of my view," tweeted Swamy. 
 
 Swamy got trolled on Twitter as twitterati felt that he was twisting Sorabjee's statement. 
 
 
 
 
 The noted jurist had earlier told the press, "Governor is well within his right to defer swearing-in for a few days."
 
 
 
 All India Forum of Muslim Journalists on Sunday 'congratulated' senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy "for becoming an expert in the dubious art of running with the hares and hunting with the hounds." 
 
 "You (Swamy) are now extending your moral support to AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala against whom you lodged a criminal complaint. The criminal case is still pending disposal. Or is it a case of adverse impact of senility?," asked S M Pasha, convener of the AIFMJ in an open letter to Swamy.
 
 Swamy has been a strong supporter of Sasikala since O Panneerselvam raised a banner of revolt against her a week ago.
