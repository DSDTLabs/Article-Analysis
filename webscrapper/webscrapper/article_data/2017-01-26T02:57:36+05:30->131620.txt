PATNA/NEW DELHI: Senior JD(U) member   courted controversy on Tuesday when he said that the "  is bigger than the  ". The remark drew flak on Wednesday with the   (NCW) seeking an explanation from him. JD(U) said Yadav's remark was misinterpreted, but offered an apology "if anyone is hurt". 

 Addressing a function in Patna on Tuesday, Yadav warned JD(U) workers against the pitfalls of voting without applying one's mind. "If a daughter's honour is compromised, it affects only the family and the village or community, but if the vote's honour is compromised, it impacts the entire nation," he said. "If you sell your vote, then the honour of the state, society and country will go for five years," he said amid huge applause.
 
 On Wednesday, Yadav tried to justify his statement. "One should honour one's vote the way one loves his daughter. What's wrong in this statement? There is no question of changing it," he said.
 
 Party spokesman K C Tyagi said Yadav's remark was misinterpreted. "He was explaining the significance of a vote and did not intend to hurt the sentiments of women. We apologise if anyone is hurt," he said.
 
 NCW wrote to Yadav saying it strongly condemned the use of "such offensive, objectionable and misogynistic statements by persons holding responsible positions". It asked him to provide an explanation on the matter in 24 hours, failing which he would be required to appear before the commission.
