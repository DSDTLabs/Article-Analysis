New Delhi: If the motive behind introducing digitisation in universities was to hasten the examination   or admission processes, it doesn’t appear to be bearing fruit at  .

 Students who appeared for exams in May are still waiting for their results. Swati Verma, a student of Development communication, recently filed an RTI wanting to know why the results were not declared “even after more than a month of the exam”. 
 
 Earlier this month,   had made tall claims about its new automation system, which had “helped us declare BTech final semester results in record time”. 
 
 However, students pursuing law, English and mass communication claimed they were still waiting for their exam results. 
 
 AAA Faizi, controller of exams, said “most results have been released”, adding that the delay in some subjects was due to issues with paper correction”.
 
 He maintained that the new automation system had helped make the process “transparent and quick”.
