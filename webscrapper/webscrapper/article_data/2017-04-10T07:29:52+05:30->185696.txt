PATNA: Bihar ranks 33rd among the 36 states and   as far as   is concerned.
 
  According to the data of Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), a central agency keeping track of the state and central police forces, Bihar has one policeman for every 839 persons, ahead of only Andhra Pradesh (875 persons), West Bengal (918) and Dadra and Nagar Haveli (1,358 persons). Manipur has the best police-public ratio at 1:80.
  
  The sanctioned population to policeman ratio at national level is 554 whereas the actual ratio is 729. Barring Bihar and the other three states and union territories, all 32 states have a better than national average.
  
  The BPRD data available on its website is updated till January last year.
  
  Surprisingly, Jharkhand which was carved out of Bihar in 2000, has better public-police ratio than Bihar all through these years. According to BPRD data, Jharkhand has one policeman on a population of 436 persons, which is almost double than that of Bihar police. Delhi has one policeman for 256 persons while Himachal Pradesh has 1:425, Maharashtra 1:625 and Odisha 1:640 police-people ratio. In Uttar Pradesh, one policeman manages 596 persons.
  
  Bihar police suffer from a huge shortage of manpower. Against the sanctioned strength of 1.11 lakh policemen, Bihar police have only around 77,000 personnel. Around 34,000 police personnel are needed in the ranks of inspector to constable level.
  
  Home department principal secretary   said on Thursday that the state government would fill up the vacant positions in state police soon. Posts of 15,000 constables, 6,000 havildars, 2,700 assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs), 4,600 sub-inspectors (SI) and more than 400 inspectors are lying vacant in the state police.
  
  The police personnel posted on field duty are overburdened with   and   in which they remain engaged for more than 16 hours a day.
  
  Last year, the government recruited 11,793 constables, 4,217 girls and 7,576 boys. Though they joined their 215 days training course across 34 centres in the state on January 18 last year, they are yet to complete their courses and get their certificates even after more than 15 months.
