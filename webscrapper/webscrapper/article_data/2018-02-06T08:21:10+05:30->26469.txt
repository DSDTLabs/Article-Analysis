CHENNAI: With   for   boards having begun in many schools on Monday, schools are going full steam ahead in preparing their students for the season. However, there are still many questions on the minds of school heads due to the introduction of practical exams for   as well, from this year. 

  A section of parents expressed anguish that the practical exams are being conducted more for the sake of it rather than getting experimental and increasing the testing levels of the students.
 
 “There is nothing new being done with an aim of making children have fun with experimentation,” said Muthukumar, parent of a class XII student. 
 
 In fact, many of these practicals are being carried out in a ritualistic manner and it is very rare to find any of the students fail a practical exam, says Keshavan, another parent. “Several times, faculty are even known to help students finish an experiment in case of difficulties,” he said. 
 
 With class XI boards too being scheduled for the first time from February 15 this year, it didn’t help that they were given short notice— class XI students were told in November that they would be appearing for their practicals in the same year rather than in class XII as informed earlier. 
 
 “We are worried about completing the portions for class XI too. The externals who come-in for the class XII evaluation are holding discussions with the internal invigilators on questions for Class XI practicals, for which the students will have to prepare,” said  , principal of   school.
 
 In May 2017, the state’s school examination system was revamped for the first time in more than a decade. Accordingly,   were introduced for Class XI students.
