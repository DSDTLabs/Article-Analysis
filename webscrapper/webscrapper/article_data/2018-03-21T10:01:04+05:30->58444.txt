CHENNAI: An indigenously built   onboard Indian Space Research Organisation’s   INS-1C that can fold up like origami (the art of folding paper) is now sending   of the earth. 

 
 The camera -- a miniature multi-spectral technology demonstration (MMX-TD) -- onboard nano satellite INS-1C, was operationalised on January 16, 2018. It has been sending images to the ground station since then. 
 
  
  
 
 Data sent by the imager could be used for topographical mapping, vegetation monitoring, aerosol scattering studies and cloud studies. According to   officials, the imager was built on the concept of multi-fold reflective optics known as origami optics. This significantly reduced the thickness compared to conventional refractive cameras. 
 
 
  
  
 
 The camera provides RGB snaps of 29mX29m area with 23m ground sampling from polar sun-synchronous orbit of 505km altitude. The camera was developed by Space Applications Centre of Isro under the Robust Technology Development Programme.
 
  
  
 
 “The reflective optics is based on metal mirrors, rather than the usual glass based origami lens. The use of metal reflectors make the camera potentially much more versatile in terms of spectral coverage,” Isro said in a release. “Although miniature cameras such as those found in cellphones are now available commonly, their resolution and light collection are poor with respect to their full size counterparts.”
 
 Isro’s PSLV-C40 placed Indian Nano Satellite-1C (INS-1C), an experimental satellite, in orbit on January 12, 2018. It is the third satellite in the Indian Nano Satellite (INS) series.
