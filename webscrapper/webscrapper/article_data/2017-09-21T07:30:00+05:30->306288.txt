Chandigarh: In an effort to make residents feel safe, Chandigarh police is in process of starting a project wherein resident, school and market associations, along with others, belonging to the sector will be linked to respective SHOs through a WhatsApp group. The move comes after market and resident welfare associations highlighted the non-responsive beat box systems and ineffective night patrolling leading to rise in criminal cases. 

 The decision was taken in order to promote   in a meeting organized by Chandigarh Commission for Protection for Child Rights (CCPCR) on Wednesday. It was decided that sector-wise monthly meetings will be held at the community centre of the respective sector amongst in the presence of SHO, beat staff, Resident Welfare Association, Market Welfare Association, Senior Citizen Sector Unit, prominent personalities, institutions and NGOs of the area. Chairperson CCPCR Harjinder Kaur said, “Chandigarh had community policing program earlier. Commission intends to re-introduce the concept to provide safe childhood to children in the city.”
 
 The collaborative group will regularly monitor and sensitize the residents in the area. Collaborative and Collective efforts by working groups will work as a Watchdog of the area.
 
 “Community policing model can be set up in some sectors as a pilot project. And in this regard, a meeting can be organised next week to deliberate on the action plan. With the use of technology like WhatsApp group, collaborative community policing group can communicate easily and update each other. We may begin with any two or three sectors like Sector 44, 45, 43, as discussed for the pilot project,” said SSP Nilambri Vijay Jagadale.
