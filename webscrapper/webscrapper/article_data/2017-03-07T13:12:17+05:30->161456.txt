NASHIK: The   ( ) has started a survey of its   in the city to find out operational and sick units along with the plots that are occupied but not operational. 

 However, the survey would take a few months to complete due to inadequate numbers of surveyors . Speaking to TOI, an official from MIDC, said, "We have already started the survey to find out how many industries are operational and how many are sick. Moreover, some industries have constructed buildings and also obtained Building Completion Certificates (BCC), but they have not started operations. We will get all the details once the survey is over. We have started with Satpur and Ambad industrial estates." 
 
 He added, "We have completed 30% of the survey, but it may be delayed due to inadequate surveyors. One of our surveyors just retired. Now, we have only three surveyors. Apart from the survey, they also need to do routine works. The survey has been going on for the past two months."
 
 The Satpur and Ambad industrial estates of the MIDC are fully occupied and there is no land available for the existing industries to expand further or new industries to set up their base here. The scarcity of land for industries in the district has affected the industrial growth of Nashik as new investors did not come to Nashik.
 
 According to industry expert, there are close to 100 acres lying unproductive because of the sick units in the MIDC. Hence, there has been demand from industries to revive the idle land of sick industries. This will not only bring new investment, but will also create job opportunities at large.
