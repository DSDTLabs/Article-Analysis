AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court once again sounded criticised the  , commenting on Wednesday that all   have become   are converted into parking zones.

 While hearing PILs on damaged roads and the stray cattle menace, a bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje pulled up the authorities for not being able to manage traffic in the city. Discussing overcrowded autorickshaws, the judges remarked, “There are so many passengers made to sit in autorickshaws that one cannot make out who drives the auto and who applies the brakes.”
 
 The court criticized people’s parking habits and said that unmanaged traffic results in narrowing down of two-three lane roads into a single lane. People park their vehicles even on flyovers, the judges said and asked the government to resolve the issue.
 
 In response, government pleader Manisha Shah told the court that the government will take all efforts to see that “there is no parking/pick-up stands on crossroads, which may ultimately affect and cause hindrance to the traffic”.
 
 The state government also assured the HC that such areas will be declared no parking areas and “steps shall be taken by the DCP and ACP traffic to see that the police officers in-charge of traffic are instructed to see that there is no parking/pick-up stands at least on the crossroads at this stage”.
