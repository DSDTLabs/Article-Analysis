Actor Michael B. Jordan says buying a house for his parents was a "dream", but living with them has had a damaging effect on his personal life.

 The ' ' star shares his mansion with his mother and father,   and Michael A. Jordan, and though the dynamic between himself and his "room-mates" can be "weird", they try to make allowances for one another, reports thetimes.co.uk.
 
 Asked if living with his parents cramps his dating style, he nodded and said: "Who are you telling, man? And they know that too, so it's a balance, and about understanding where they are in their life and marriage. But you know, you have room-mates, but they are also your parents. And that's a weird dynamic."
 
 However, the 30-year-old actor said it means a lot to be able to keep his parents secure by sharing his house with them.
 
 "Look, it's every kid's dream to buy their mom and dad a house. It was a bucket-list thing for me."
 
 The "Fantastic Four" star says he wanted to change his name when he was younger because of comparisons to legendary basketball star  , but it eventually made him vow to make a name for himself in his own right.
 
 "I just thought, 'You know what? I don't want people to think of Michael Jordan when they hear my name. I want them to know me'," he said.
