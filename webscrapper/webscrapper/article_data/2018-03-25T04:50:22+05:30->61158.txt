NEW DELHI: A day after securing bail from the Delhi high court in INX Media bribery case,  , son of former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, on Saturday got another relief from a city court that granted him protection from arrest by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) till April 16 in   case. 

 
 “Investigation is stated to be pending, in which the presence of the applicant is required. Since three weeks’ time is prayed for by the CBI, by submitting that during this period law shall prevail, apparently it means that as a matter of legal and judicial propriety, the applicant (Karti) shall not be arrested by the CBI during the pendency of the instant application,” said Judge O P Saini. In the ED case too, the court made a similar observation. 
 
 The case will be heard again on April 16, 2018. The matter pertains to the “undue” grant of   clearance to Global Communication Holding Services Ltd for investment in   when P Chidambaram Was Union finance minister. 
 
 The court had earlier discharged former Union minister Dayanidhi Maran and his brother and   chairman Kalanithi Maran and others in the same case. Abattery of senior lawyers — Kapil Sibal, Gopal Subramaniam, Salman Khurshid and Mohit Mathur — appeared for Karti. They argued there was apprehension that their client may be arrested on a false accusation. It was also argued that the CBI arbitrarily arrested Karti in connection with the INX Media case.“I am not named in the FIR. I have not been chargesheeted. Besides, Maran brothers and all other accused have been discharged,” Karti pleaded through his counsel.
