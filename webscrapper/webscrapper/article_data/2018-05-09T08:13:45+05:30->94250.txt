PANCHKULA: Local   and   chief whip   and former deputy chief minister and senior   leader Chander Mohan took to media on Tuesday to spar over the issue of demolition of a temple in Panchkula.

 
 The Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) had come to raze a temple in Rally village, demolition of which was opposed by the Congress leaders and the Brahmin community.
 
 MLA Gupta, who also later opposed the demolition drive, had said on Monday that he supported the people’s sentiments towards the temple. He said the land would be given to the temple trust if it paid the money equivalent to the land’s value to the HSVP.
 
 On Monday evening, Chander Mohan addressed a press conference and levelled allegations against Gupta that the latter wanted to transfer the land in the name of   set up in the name of his son.
 
 On Tuesday morning, MLA Gupta also called a press conference and stated that the Congress leader should produce a proof to support his allegation within a week or apologize for his statement.
 
 “Chander Mohan changed his religion from Hindu to Muslim for a woman and left his Hindu wife alone. Such person should not comment over religion or religious sentiments. I will move a legal complaint against him if he does not take back the allegations he has levelled against me and my son,” said Gupta.
 
 Soon after, Chander Mohan hit back by addressing media at his residence in Sector 8. He said, “On one hand, the BJP government is talking about temples and on the other, it is demolishing a temple which has been in the Rally village before Panchkula city was built. I am in support of the village people and will not let this temple be demolished by anyone.”
 
 When asked about the MLA’s comment on his personal life, Chander Mohan said, “Gupta commented on my personal life to gain political benefit. He wants to win in the next elections and that is why he is talking about such things.”
