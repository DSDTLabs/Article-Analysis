JAIPUR: To end the monopoly of big  , the   (JMC) has prepared a proposal to give   in each ward. 

 According to the officials, in present scenario, out of eight zones, contract of six zones has been given to one person who has registered separate firms under his name. For better   in 91 wards of the city, JMC has now proposed to appoint one contractor for each ward. 
 
 City mayor Ashok Lahoti has directed the officials to implement the new system soon for effective sanitation in the city. To encourage the small contractors, JMC administration has also given relaxation in conditions of the contract. “Any experience or turnover of the firm would not be required to apply for the contract. Also, work will be awarded after the contractor deposits 10% of the security amount,” said a JMC official. 
 
 As per the conditions, one firm can take up work in maximum four wards. JMC has also fixed the duration of work for sanitation workers. “These workers will have to be present on the field between 7am and 4pm. They will get one hour lunch break,” added the official.
 
 In the absence of proper sanitation, JMC has also incorporated strict provisions in the contract. Per lane Rs 2,000 will be deducted from the contractor’s remuneration in case he/she fails to maintain proper sanitation in the designated ward. Similarly, Rs 2,000 will be deducted per drain, which is smaller than two feet. 
 
 Rs 100 will be deducted if the contractor fails to prevent defacing of walls in 1-km periphery of his/her ward. 
 
 The complaints registered on the recently launched sanitation app will be redressed in 24 hours as contractors will be held responsible for the same, the JMC official said.
 
 This would end the monopoly of one contractor as sanitation workers under him will not for call strike on every small issue to pressurise JMC administration. In past one year, sanitation workers have gone on strike over seven times.
