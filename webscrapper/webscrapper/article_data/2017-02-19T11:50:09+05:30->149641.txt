KOLKATA: Plagued by injuries that has kept him on the sidelines,   never lost faith in his own abilities. Nor did his coach Sanjoy Sen. On Saturday, the strongly-built lad from Hoshiarpur showed why he is one of the country's leading strikers. Preferred ahead of   in Mohub Bagan's starting XI, Balwant scored a quick-fire brace late in the first half to help his team rally from a goal down to beat DSK Shivajians 3-1 in the I-League at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium.

 After   had given the visitors a deserved lead in the 33rd minute, Bagan were back on level terms in the 42nd minute thanks to a howler by Shivajians goalkeeper  . The latter completely misjudged a cross from the right by Pritam Kotal, only managing to pop the ball up. Balwant showed his predatory instincts by being there at the right place at the right time to nod into the open net.
