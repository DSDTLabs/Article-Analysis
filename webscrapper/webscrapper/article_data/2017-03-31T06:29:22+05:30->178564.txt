KORAPUT: The city bus service in Koraput district, which has remained paralysed since January 25 for dispute over permission of route, is expected to resume soon as a revised route chart has been prepared by the district administration. 

 "Minor changes have been brought into the existing route chart and we expect the bus service will resume within a week," said collector (Koraput)   to TOI. 
 
 The collector chaired a high-level meeting, involving all stakeholders and officials, to sort out the issue on Saturday as the private bus owners had been opposing plying of city buses on certain routes. 
 
 Special fare has been prepared for the city bus service. While a private party has got the tender to run the services, the administration has formed a trust in the name of Jeypore-Koraput-Sunabeda Urban Transport Trust for managing the bus service, the collector said. 
 
 Officials said every day, 20 buses with sitting capacity of 30 each will run on   route.
