HYDERABAD: The days of standing in long queues and returning dejected seeing ‘No Cash’ boards on ATMs are back for residents in several parts of the city. The three-day holiday for banks combined with the one-day strike call by bank employees’ unions have ensured that several ATMs in the city have run out of cash.

 The banks were closed on Friday on account of Shivaratri. Followed by the weekend holidays, the banks worked on Monday, but were unable to fill all the ATMs with the required cash. 
 
 P Raghava Rao, a 62-year-old retired government servant, was disappointed to find the shutters of a private bank   at Himayatngar locked around 1 pm. He went down searching for cash down the same road, only to find three more ATMs locked. His hopes were raised at the fifth cash machine as there was a guard sitting outside. “But the guard waved me away, saying there is no money,” he said.
 
 Pragati Kumar, 22, faced a similar situation at the SBI ATM in Vidyanagar. “I forgot that there were continuous holidays. When I went to withdraw cash, there was no money,” the student said.
 
 Bank officials said that it would take at least a week for the situation to return to normal as Tuesday too would see no work in banks. “After that, the salary week begins and funds will be allotted for salary and distribution of pensions. Hence, the tight situation will continue for the next one week,” said a bank manager in the city. An increase in over the counter transactions in the meantime will also hit the supply in ATMs. 
 
 During the days following the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, the   had restricted the supply of funds to banks. The situation eased later and banks began getting cash as per request. But the latest holidays and the strike has again restricted the cash flow for the time being.
