PATNA: ‘Bhadra kaal’, the period during which Hindus avoid performing auspicious work, will not mar   or ‘Holika Dahan’ this year.

 According to Shripati Tripathi, head of Markand Jyotish Kendra on  , ‘Bhadra kaal’ will last only between 7.45pm on March 11 and 7.35am on March 12. Holikas this year can, therefore, be set afire from 5.53pm to 10pm on March 12.
 
 “There will be no need to wait for the puja to be performed for ‘Holika Dahan’. People can proceed with the ritual after the sundown,” Tripathi said.
 
  priest Santosh Kumar Ojha also said ‘Bhadra kaal’ would end much before ‘Holika Dahan’. Holi can thus be celebrated after the sacred fire, he said.
 
 Ajay Kumar Pandey of   near Boring Road crossing said ‘Holika Dahan’ this year would be quite auspicious. “The evil will vanquish before Holi as ‘Bhadra kaal’ will not follow. Everyone will be blessed with prosperity,” he said.
 
 Preparations, meanwhile, are afoot to prepare ‘Holika’. Tree branches and trunks as well as pieces of waste wood are piling up on the road in front of Sri Krishna Children’s Park. “The volume is increasing every day... By March 12, it will be huge enough to create traffic jams,” said a local.
 
 The ‘Holika’ preparation near the Gol Ghar has already blocked part of the road. Plastic bottles and bags have also been collected here for the sacred fire, which while burning will add to the air pollution.
 
 Jyoti Mishra, a resident of West Jakkanpur, will like the government to allot grounds for ‘Holika Dahan’ rituals. “Holi revellers in my locality dump ‘Holika’ articles right in the middle of Laxmi Market nearby, much to the hardship of people,” she said.
