NAVI MUMBAI: Four cops from the Mumbai special branch, including a woman, were severely beaten up by a mob in Kombadbhuje village at Ulwe in Uran taluka when they reached there in the early hours of Tuesday to nab illegal immigrants. As the cops were not in uniform, the villagers mistook them for thieves. The thrashing was severe. Clothes were torn off and the cops sustained multiple injuries. 

 The injured cops-sub-inspector  , and constables Narendra Patil, Murlidhar Gawali and   (the woman)-have been admitted to MGM Hospital, Vashi, for treatment.
 
 Acting on a complaint lodged by the injured cops, the NRI coastal police registered an FIR against around 150 people, who have been booked under the IPC for rioting, unlawful assembly, assault, using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of duty, and outraging modesty (of the woman constable).
 
 Senior inspector   said, "The Mumbai cops reached the village around 3am to arrest Bangladeshi nationals. They were told by five Bangladeshis who had been earlier arrested that there were more illegal immigrants in Kombadbhuje village."
 
 Bagade said the Mumbai cops were probably unaware that in rural areas people are sensitive about nightly arrivals of outsiders as instances of housebreak and theft abound.
