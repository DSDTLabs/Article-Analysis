ROHTAK: Funds of Rs 1.10 crore meant for the Union government’s flagship programme Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) were misused by a private firm by allegedly submitting fake training receipts to Haryana government. This was revealed in a reply to a query under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

 A Bhiwani-based activist Murari Lal   had sought information under the RTI Act about the funds spent under the scheme. According to the documents, the Haryana department of women and child development had ordered for procurement of ultrasonic pocket fetal doppler machines (UPFD) worth Rs 1.10 crore on March 31, 2015. Evergreen  , a firm from Faridabad, was ordered by the state government to supply these.
 
 Gupta had sought information from the department director regarding the purchase and utility of the 2,762 machines. The director’s office informed that in many districts, these machines had not been used and were kept in store as no one knew their operation for which no training was imparted.
 
 “In Bhiwani, Yammunanagar, Jhajjar, Rewari, Rohtak, Kaithal, Narnaul, Panipat and   no training had been imparted for the use of the machines. Only Sonipat, Ambala and Karnal district were given training through the firm representative,  ,” it was stated in the reply. 
 
 The government had mentioned in its contract with the firm that the payment would be subject to supply and training of equipment at the district centres. On September 2, 2015, the supplier submitted bills and receipts from 12 districts that training to handle the machine had been completed and sought for the release of payment for the same. The supplier allegedly submitted forged documents about training to the department and its payment was released on September 7, 2015.
