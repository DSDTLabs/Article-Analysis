Panaji: The directorate of education (DoE) is presently in the process of assessing the number of government primary schools with very low enrolment, which are on the verge of closure. 

 The directorate has also asked its taluka-level officials to assess the schools with surplus teachers as against those with single teachers. The report will be submitted to the DoE by May 19, based on which a decision will be taken to resolve the issues.
 
 “Based on the information, we will decide which government primary schools can be amalgamated to provide better quality of teaching. Our focus is to improve the quality of teaching,” director of education, G P Bhat, said.
 
 Government primary schools are facing a crisis of sorts as parents are increasingly opting for private management institutions as against government ones. The number of government primary schools with an enrolment of 20 or lower has touched close to 400. The number of government primary schools has come down from over a 1,000 to just 740 in less than a decade.
 
 The number of low enrolment government primary schools has gone up more than three folds over the last seven years from 172 in 2008 to 393 in 2015-16.
 
 Teaching is also affected due to low enrolment as schools have to function with only one teacher if their enrolment is 24 or lower, as per the state's education rules.
 
 But, unlike the general belief, not all these schools have single teachers operating them because they have a low student enrolment. Recently, DoE made it mandatory for the newly-appointed government teachers to sign a 15-year bond to serve in rural schools, due to high demand from them to serve in urban areas. This forces rural schools to function as single-teacher schools.
 
  Single-teacher schools do not get a headmaster, a clerk or a peon, leaving all administrative duties to the lone teacher of the school.
