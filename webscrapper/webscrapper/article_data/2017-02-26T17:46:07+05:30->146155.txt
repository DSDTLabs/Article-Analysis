The wait is finally over! Director   has finally found his dream heroine to play the iconic writer and poet  , none other than  .

 'Manju Warrier will play Kamala Surayya in   and the shoot will begin on March 20 at Ottapalam. To get into the character of middle-aged Madhavikutty, Manju will have to gain some weight.

 The film has Murali Gopy as Madhavikutty's husband while Prithviraj plays a fictional character who leads the story. Actor Anoop Menon will also be seen in an important role.
