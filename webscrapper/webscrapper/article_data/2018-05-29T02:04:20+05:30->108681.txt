NOIDA: The families that lost their shanties to the massive fire said they were waiting for monetary relief announced by the district administration to arrive and aid in the form of food, water and clothes would not make up for the losses they had suffered. 

 The villagers said they had lost valuable documents like   and voter cards, ATM cars apart from cash. 
 
 “You are writing about us? Will this change anything? We hope there is some relief,” said a labourer whose shanty was burnt.
 
 Sources said the monetary relief announced by the administration would take two more days to come. 
 
 “These families will be given a monetary relief of about Rs 3,800 in accordance with the UP government’s rules. This will include house allowance and ex-gratia,” district magistrate BN Singh said. While the   said 307 families had been affected, the district administration out the figure at 110 families.
