NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan are back to sniping at each other with the MEA on Monday summoning the deputy high commissioner of Pakistan to lodge a protest against attempts by   to raise the “Khalistan” issue while Sikh pilgrims are visiting the country. 

 
 MEA said “inflammatory statements” and posters have been seen at various places where the pilgrims visited. This comes a day after the MEA alleged that Pakistani authorities had prevented the Sikh pilgrims visiting   gurudwara from meeting the Indian envoy, who was prevented from going there.
  
 In a statement, the second in as many days, the MEA said, “Pakistan was called upon to immediately stop all such activities that were aimed at undermining India’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and incitement of disharmony in India.” 
 
 MEA said the government told the diplomat that “such repeated attempts by authorities and entities in Pakistan to extend support to secessionist movements in India amount to interference in the internal affairs of India”. Pakistan refuted India’s allegations on Sunday, but is yet to comment on Monday’s developments.
