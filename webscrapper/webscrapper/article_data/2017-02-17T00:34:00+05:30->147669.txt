 A team led by Kancheepuram superintendent of police J Mutharasi gained entry into the resort on Wednesday morning and began inquiries with the MLAs. Sources said the MLAs said they had been staying voluntarily and had not been confined.

He told reporters that the party was waiting for the invitation from governor C Vidyasagar Rao to form the government.
