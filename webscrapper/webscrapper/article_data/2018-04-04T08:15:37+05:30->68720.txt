HYDERABAD: Resumption of five acres of government land from  , aprivate hospital management group, by RR district officials recently has sparked a row between the revenue department and a consortium of banks led by Andhra Bank. Though the land belongs to the government and was allotted to the firm nine years ago, the banks’ consortium, which had granted Rs 90 crore loan since 2010 to the firm, said the land cannot be resumed until the loan issue is resolved. The consortium is now planning to legally challenge the state’s decision.

 The administration cancelled the land allotment in survey no 28 in   in   last week and resumed the land on the grounds that the hospital management had failed to utilise the land for the purpose it was allotted. The land is worth about Rs 200 crore. The banks contended that the state cannot unilaterally resume the land as they have provided loan to the allottee and that the hospital management had evaded repayment of loans.
 
 “The banks’ consortium approached the court against the revenue department’s objection and made the district collector too a party to the case. While the issue is in the court, the administration resumed the land which is objectionable,” an assistant general manager of Andhra Bank told TOI on condition of anonymity. When contacted, Ranga Reddy collector M   said the land was resumed based on government’s instructions. Rao said he is not aware about loans taken by Pacific Hospitals and the court case.
 
 The previous   government had allotted five acres in   to Pacific Hospitals in 2009. Though the market rate for the land was about Rs 50 crore at that time, the government charged a paltry Rs 50 lakh. The hospital management availed itself of Rs 22-crore loan from various banks, including AB (Rs 10 cr), UBI (Rs 7 cr) and IB (Rs 5 cr) by mortgaging the land.
