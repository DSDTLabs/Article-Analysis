MARGAO: Union minister for human resource development (HRD) Prakash Javadekar, on Friday, urged the public to join the digital revolution initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi by choosing to move over from a cash-based economy to less-cash and then to a cashless society.

 “This will ensure transparency in dealings and reduce corruption. Go digital, go cashless - herein lies the good of the country and its people,” Javadekar said, while speaking at the award ceremony of Lucky   and Digidhan Vyapar Yojana awards at the Digidhan mela (fair) held at Margao. 
 
 Digidhan mela is a central government initiative aimed at enabling citizens and merchants to undertake real-time digital transactions at the fair. Customers and merchants using RuPay Card, BHIM, UPI (Bharat Interface for Money/Unified Payment Interface), USSD based *99# service and Aadhaar-enabled Payment Service (AePS) are eligible for participating in the daily and weekly lucky draws.
 
 Several banks, service providers and traders had participated in the day-long fair. Minister for town and country planning ( )  , speaking on the occasion, said that the state government needs to be commended for its “seriousness in bringing about a cashless society”. 
 
 “Goa needs to go more cashless. When people in Goa will start buying fish using Ru-pay card, only then can we say that the cashless concept has succeeded in Goa. I am certain the government will take steps to make that happen,” Sardesai said.
