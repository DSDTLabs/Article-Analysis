CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Wednesday directed the Haryana government not to take any coercive action against   Gandhi Charitable Trust (RGCT) against whom the state had issued a notice for not making the hospital operationalise in given time frame.

 Giving relief to the trust, HC made it clear that the trust shall make a detailed application to the state government with particulars of the documents that it seeks, within a period of one week. Thereafter, the state shall provide the requisite documents within four weeks to the trust.
 
 “The trust shall submit its response within six weeks after the receipt of requisite information/documents. On receiving reply from trust, the state shall pass a speaking order after affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and till that time no coercive action against the property of the trust shall be resorted to by the state authorities,” ordered the HC.
 
 A division bench headed by Justice   passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by RGCT, New Delhi. The trust had approached the HC against the show-cause notice given by state asking the trust why its lease should not be cancelled since the hospital was not operational till the deadline of January 2017.
 
 Main grievance of the trust was that it could not respond to the notice in the absence of relevant documents that are required to be furnished by state. A chunk of around five acres was leased to the RGCT headed by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, her son   and daughter Priyanka Vadra for 33 years in 2010 in   village of Gurgaon district.
