BENGALURU: Olympic silver medalist and   marquee player PV's Sindhu's   clash against  ' Tanvi Lad was rendered redundant even before the two players took to the court at the Koramangala Indoor Stadium on Sunday.

 Such was Acers' dominance in the contest that Sindhu, playing Smashers' Trump Match, could only fight for pride with the Delhi side having already sealed the tie 0-5. Her 11-6, 11-7 win made it 5-2 but it was Acers who celebrated their first victory in the league. Earlier,   fell victim to Acers' Danish shuttler  's grit and guile, throwing away a first game lead to lose 12-10, 4-11, 6-11. World No. 2 Jorgensen proved a far superior player at the net and his seemingly impenetrable defence wore Sugiarto out towards the end, as Acers went 1-0 up.
 
 There were more wasted opportunities in store as Smashers' mixed doubles pair of PV Sindhu and Chris Adcock failed to capitalize on early dominance against Vladimir Ivanov and Jwala Gutta. Having won the first game fairly comfortably, the Smashers duo could only watch as Acers' Indo-Russian combine drew level and then gave their side a 2-0 cushion in the tie with a 11-7, 4-11, 9-11 win.
 
 It was left to Parupalli Kashyap to bring Smashers back into the game. While he had some good moments in the first game to go ahead 10-9 against world No. 4 Son Wan Ho, his plans were foiled as the Korean allied to give his side a 3-0 lead. Playing their Trump Match, Acers' Ivanov and Ivan Sozonov hammered Adcock and Mads Pieler Kolding 11-6, 11-6.
