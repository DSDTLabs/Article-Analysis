Rajkot: General secretary of Ribda farmers’ cooperative committee allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself in the village on Rajkot-Gondal Road on Wednesday morning. The body of general secretary Gautam Upadhyay (41) was found in the bedroom of former Gondal MLA Mahitpatsinh Jadeja’s house by the latter’s domestic help Bhagwanji Bagthadia when he went for cleaning at around 11am. Upadhyay’s body was found on a blood-stained sheet with a bullet hole in his head. He had apparently shot himself with the licensed pistol of Jadeja.  Police suspect that Upadhyay had committed suicide over some financial problems and irregularities in the committee. “Two days ago, some bank officials had visited the committee. This appears to have scared Upadhyay who decided to end his life lest his crime get exposed,” said an official from Gondal taluka police station. Before ending his life, Upadhyay had reportedly sent an audio clip to Jignesh Sarvaiya, a clerk at the committee, Digvijaysinh Jadeja, secretary of Ribda village panchayat and told them that he owed Rs 30 lakh to 10 persons.  Police have sent the body for postmortem. “It appears that Upadhyay was very well acquainted with Jadeja’s house as he knew where the latter kept his pistol. In his statement, Jadeja told us that he had some bank officials visiting Upadhyay recently and indicated that Upadhyay might have been into some financial crisis that drove him to take the extreme step. We have registered the case and are probing whether there was any foul play,” added the official. Jadeja has been elected as MLA from Gondal seat twice as an independent candidate.
