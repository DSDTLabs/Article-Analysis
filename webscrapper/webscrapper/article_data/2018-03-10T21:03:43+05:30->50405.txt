* The protesting farmers, who today reached Thane, are on their way to the state legislative assembly, which they intend to 'gherao' or encircle on Monday to protest the Maharashtra government's alleged failure to fulfill its promises.'

 * According to a source in the police, however, the protesters will not be allowed to reach the Vidhan Bhavan and will be stopped at Azad Maidan.
 
 * Mumbai traffic police have made elaborate arrangements for a potentially traffic-clogged Monday.
 
 * The farmers are demanding a complete waiver of loans and power bills and the implementation of the   recommendations. They also want forest land to be transferred to those who have been tilling it for years and increased compensation for peasants whose crops were damaged in the recent hailstorms and pink bollworm infestation, reported news agency PTI. 
 
 "We also want the state government to refrain from forceful acquisition of farmlands in the name of development projects like the superhighway and the bullet train,"   (AIKS) secretary Raju Desle had said earlier.
 
 * The 180 kilometre-long march has been organised by the AIKS, which expects the number of protesters to reach 50-60,000 by the time the group reaches Mumbai.
