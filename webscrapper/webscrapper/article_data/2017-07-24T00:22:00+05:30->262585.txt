Pune: The search and rescue operation for two city-based trekkers who were swept away by the gushing waters of a nullah in Tamhini ghat on Saturday, continued on Sunday. However, their bodies could not be traced till Sunday evening. 

 The search operation is focused on the areas in Tamhini valley and Maan taluka of Raigad district. Three friends working with a telecom company’s sales office at Kharadi IT park in Pune had gone for a trek to Tamhini on Saturday. 
 
 Two of them, Rahul Umate (32) and Sagar Dudhe (34), were swept away when they attempted to cross the nullah. Umate, a native of Nagpur, was living in Wagholi while Dudhe was staying in Sangvi. 
 
 Paud police’s inspector Suresh Nimbalkar said teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), local police and villagers continued with the search. “We have communicated about the incident to Raigad police and search operations have begun in   area,” Nimbalkar said.
 
 Nimbalkar told TOI that the three trekkers had reached Nive village in Tamhini ghat section and then walked towards the hills located at Pimpri village. While walking towards the hill, they decided to cross the nullah. However, the water with a strong current was flowing in the nullah. One of the three decided to stay back. He told the other two not to cross the dangerous waters. However, they waded into the waters, Nimbalkar said. 
 
 The third   did not enter the water. An 800 feet deep waterfall is located on the nullah a few meters from the spot from where the two were swept away. Professional trekkers have recommended utmost caution while taking up adventure activities, 
 
 Onkar Oak, an expert trekker, said deaths generally occur at waterfalls, cliffs, nullahs with a strong current, in lakes, falling off forts and other such places.
