TRICHY: Farmers from more than 15 villages in Lalgudi taluk and some parts in Mana chanallur are facing difficulties in selling their harvested samba produce as traders in the open market are offering a low procurement price. Farmers have appealed to the district administration to take steps to open adequate number of direct procurement centres (DPCs) to purchase samba paddy.
Samba paddy cultivation was taken up in areas including Ariyur, Keezha Anbil, Senka raiyur, Natarajapuram, Satha mangalam, Kattur, Poovalur, Manthurai and Idaiyattru mangalam and few villages in   taluk accessing the filter point irrigation.
 
 Owing to acute water shortage farmers had carried out samba cultivation only in 10,000 acres this year. By this time every year the government would set up DPCs. “There is no sign (this time) from the district administration,“ said N Veerasekaran, coordinator, Ayyan Vaikkal Irrigation Farmers Association.
 
 Ayilai Siva Suriyan, district secretary of   affiliated to CPI, said, “Last year the government had fixed procurement price as Rs 1,520 for A-grade variety (60kg bag) and Rs 1,410 for common variety. However, this year traders were not even ready for Rs 1,400 for A-grade and Rs 1,140 for common variety.“
 
 When contacted, T Senthilkumar, regional manager,  , Trichy said, “Once we get intimation from the district administration we will commence the process of identifying the locations to set up centres across the district.“
