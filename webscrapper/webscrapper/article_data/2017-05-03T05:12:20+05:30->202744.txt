MUMBAI: Students who wish to change their   for Class XII will, apart from the marks, require a "valid reason" to justify the switch. 

 The  , which will conduct an online process for Second Year Junior College (SYJC) seats, in a recent circular said students can change their college only if it is far from home or doesn't offer a stream of choice, or if parents have been transferred, leading to relocation.
 
 Every year, thousands of students change their college after Class XI, unhappy with the option given to them during the First Year Junior College (FYJC) admission process. During the switch, which was earlier not online, there would be instances of admissions not being conducted on the basis of merit. "Now we want to change that and also ensure that large numbers of students don't attempt to change their college just because they are unhappy. This would mean wasting all efforts of the  ," said BB Chavan, deputy director of education, Mumbai.
 
 The state education department is likely to give admission on the basis of a student's Class X marks. "The fine print of the online process isn't finalized. We cannot consider Class XI marks since exams are conducted at the college level," said Chavan, who issued the circular. Currently, colleges admit students on either Class X or XI marks, as there are no set guidelines.
 
 The education department has also asked junior colleges to not force students to pay fees for the next academic year if they wish to change college. "If the student does not get a change of college in the online process, the college can collect the   and let him continue. There must be no complaints in this regard," said the circular.
