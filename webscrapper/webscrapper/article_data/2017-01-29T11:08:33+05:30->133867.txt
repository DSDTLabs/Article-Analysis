VADODARA/ ANAND: A judicial magistrate in Borsad sent accused   to five days remand on Saturday. 

 Chandresh Patel, who is accused of masterminding the attempted murder of Borsad’s independent councillor Pragnesh Patel on January 13, was produced at the residence of Borsad’s judicial magistrate. 
 
 Earlier, a team of   had nabbed Chandresh from Bangkok and handed him to Anand police.   sleuths had nabbed Chandresh from Hotel Rekon in Bangkok in a joint operation with the Thai police. The primary interrogation by the cops have revealed that Chandresh’s friend Shyamgiri Goswami had arranged his meeting with underworld don Ravi Pujari’s shooter Suresh Pillai of Thane.
 
 Chandresh allegedly had an old enmity with Pragnesh over the cable network business in Borsad and was furious about an attack on him by Pragnesh’s brother Sanket in October last. Moreover, Chandresh’s mother Shanta Patel was defeated in the local body elections against Pragnesh which had fuelled the enmity. Chandresh had allegedly offered Pillai Rs25 lakh to eliminate Pragnesh. While Pragnesh survived the attack after undergoing operation at a private hospital in Vadodara, ATS has arrested three accused including Pillai. Borsad police had sought Chandresh’s remand on the grounds that they need to further interrogate the accused as so far he has revealed that he had paid Rs 1.5 lakh to Shyamgiri. 
 
 According to cops, Chandresh did not have the financial resources to pay the entire Rs 25 lakh which he had promised Pillai. 
 
 “We want to investigate from where would have Chandresh got the money that he had promised to pay,” said a police official.
