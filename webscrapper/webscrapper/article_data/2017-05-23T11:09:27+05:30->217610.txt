Stating these to be the areas of concern, UT was asked to bring the rate down in the current academic year. TOI had written earlier that in Chandigarh the dropout rate in this age group was the highest at secondary level. As per the child mapping survey 2017 there was a rise in drop-out rate in the age group 14-18 years.
