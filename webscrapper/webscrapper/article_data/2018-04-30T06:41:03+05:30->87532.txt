In a move clearly aimed at consolidating the opposition against Prime Minister  , DMK working president M K   has initiated the process to convene a national-level conference on State Autonomy. The DMK intends to invite all like-minded political parties from across the country to participate in the conclave, likely to be held in Chennai soon.

 “Modi came to power with a brute majority. People had lot of expectations from him. Instead of addressing their concerns, he is pushing a communal agenda, addressing public meetings and making false promises, which is not done by a PM. As a result, people’s anger has turned against him,” Stalin said in an interview to TOI. Even chief ministers like N Chandrababu Naidu and K   have turned against the Prime Minister, the DMK leader said.
 
 
 
 “The ‘Go Back Modi’ slogan, whichstartedin Chennai,has now reached distant London, where people protested againstModi,when he visited the country recently,” he said.
 
 “With the 15th Finance   recommendations posing a serious threat to autonomy of states, we are talking to all chief ministers and leaders of like-minded political parties across India to hold a national conclave to safeguard autonomy of states, something on the lines held by former chief minister and DMK president   in 1989. We are in touch with all of them for a national-level meet,” said Stalin.
