Agenuine   often involves a shared sense of care, concern and a desire to see each other grow. However, it also requires certain accountability factors —  , honesty,   and support. You’ve found your soul mate if your friend...

 
 If you have a friend who can be happy for you irrespective of the innumerable fights and arguments, then you have a bestie who loves you and cares for you. 
 
 
 Friendship is an emotional bond. If you have someone who shares the happiness of your success, you can bet there’s nothing but true friendship going on there. You should be happy for your best friend even when things aren’t going right in your life.
 
 
 There is nothing that can hold two   together like honesty. Friends should be truthful to each other. But honesty does not mean you make your opinions sound hurtful. Real friends aren’t judgemental, and give each other advice, but with the intention of making the situation better, not bitter. 
 
 
 Can you trust your friend with embarrasing stories about you? Are you sure he/she will guard your secrets? You should be able to communicate with your friend without restricting yourself, and he/she should know you so thoroughly that they can guage your mood without you having to say anything. 
 
 
 Though you have a right to know what’s happening in your friend’s life, there is a thin line between knowing everything and intruding in his/her life. If your friend wants to tell you something, they will, irrespective of whether you’ve asked them about it or not.
 
 
 Count your blessings if you have someone who is always there to help you. They are your emotional anchor. 
 
 
 No matter how many times you talk about the same thing, your friend will hear you out. Even if it’s a petty issue, rest assured, your friend will always be there for you.
