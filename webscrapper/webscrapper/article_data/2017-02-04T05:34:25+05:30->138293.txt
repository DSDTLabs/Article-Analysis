NEW DELHI: Being held at knifepoint and threatened with the killing of her teenaged granddaughters has left 65-year-old   so traumatised that she wakes up at the slightest noise. A lung cancer patient, she received no mercy from the two men who broke into the house and made off with money and jewellery on January 23. 

 Bhutani had lost her husband Govind Ram in 2001 and son Arun in 2008. After being diagnosed with cancer, the widow usually kept cash at home for emergency use. “The robbers must have found out about this. They also seemed to be aware that my daughter-in-law was not at home at the time,” Bhutani said.
 
 On the night of the incident, she heard noises coming from the drawing room and got up. “Before I could switch on the light, a man pounced on me and held a knife to my throat. Another tied my feet and demanded the keys to the cupboards. They threatened to kill my sleeping granddaughters if I raised an alarm,” Bhutani said with a shudder.
 
 When Bhutani requested them to take the jewellery but leave the money behind, the two men —   and   — mocked her by blowing cigarette smoke into her face. The elderly woman has since been on medication for throat and lung infections. “I am happy the cops caught the men,” she said on Friday. “I have requested the SHO to help secure my house which is located on the main road.”
