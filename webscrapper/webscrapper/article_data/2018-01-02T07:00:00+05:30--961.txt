NOIDA: The regular   and diagnostic services in Noida are likely to remain shut on Tuesday as the Noida division of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) joins the nation-wide strike against the  . The emergency services will, however, remain open, the   members said. 

 The bill seeks to allow practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy, to practise modern medicine once they complete a short-term ‘bridge’ course. The bill might come up in the Parliament for discussion on Friday.
 
 “We will support the strike call in Noida and OPD and diagnostic services in private centres of the city will remain closed from 6 am to 6 pm. Emergency services will, however, continue as usual,”  , treasurer, Noida chapter of the IMA, told TOI.
 
 He said the bill would increase corruption which already plagues the medical education system and increase the money being sought in the name of donation from aspiring students.
 
 “Capitation fee charged by medical colleges will go up and people from a non-medical background like administrators are being included in the commission replacing the MCI (Medical Council Of India) which is a body of professional practitioners,” Awana said.
 
 Most hospital authorities said it would depend on the doctors whether to come to the hospital or not. “We will keep OPD services open but it depends on the the doctors. If they decide not to work, they might not turn up,” said a spokesperson of Fortis Hospital in Sector 62.
 
 The   bill proposes to replace the MCI with the NMC and the IMA suspects that it might also do away with the Section 15 of the IMC Act, which mandates MBBS as the basic qualification to practise modern medicine.
