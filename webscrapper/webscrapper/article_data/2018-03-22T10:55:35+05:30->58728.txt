PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has demanded land from the   Jeevan Pradhikaran ( ) in Dehu village for constructing a jackwell and a pumping station to draw 100 MLD water from   dam.

 Sharing this information with TOI, a senior civic official said PCMC proposes to lay a water pipeline from Andra and   dams to Chikhali where it plans to build a water treatment plant (WTP) before supplying the water to areas like Talawade, Chikhali, Moshi, Charholi and Dudulgaon, among others.
 
 Pavana dam, which is located about 40km from the municipal limits, is the lifeline of the city. The state irrigation department releases water from the dam for power generation, which flows through the Pavana river to reach Ravet bund. The civic body lifts water from the bund, purifies it and supplies it to around 20 lakh residents.
 
 The state irrigation department has agreed to give 100MLD water from Andra dam and 167MLD water from Bhama Askhed dam to the civic body to meet its drinking water needs. The civic body will pay Rs 230 crore to the department for the permission to draw this water.
 
 The civic official said the acquisition of land required to lay the pipelines may take some time, which may delay the project. “The civic body has prepared a plan to build a jackwell and a pump house near the bund in Dehu village to lift water and send it through pipelines to WTP in Chikhali.”
