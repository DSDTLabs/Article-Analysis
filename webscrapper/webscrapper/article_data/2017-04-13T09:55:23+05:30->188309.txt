PUNE: At least seven contractors who built public toilets under the   received a rude shock when their cheques issued by the   bounced.

 The contractors claimed that their cheques worth Rs 1.50 crore have bounced owing to the non-availability of funds in the corporation’s bank account.
 
 A contractor, who did not wish to be named, told TOI that he had to approach a corporator after the civic body failed to clear his dues. Subsequently, he was issued a Bank of Maharashtra cheque worth Rs 7 lakh in the first week of April. After he deposited the cheque in Janata Sahakari Bank’s branch in Pune city on April 6, he was told the cheque could not be cleared since there was insufficient balance in the PMC’s bank account. Six other contractors also claimed of facing the same situation.
 
 “The scheme is of huge importance not just for the city, but the Union government too. The civic administration should make efforts to ensure that such goof-ups do not occur,”  , a   corporator, said.
 
 Suresh Jagtap, head of PMC’s solid waste management department, said there was a delay in depositing the funds because of work pressure owing to the financial year closure. “A separate account is maintained for the scheme. The funds come from the Centre and the state governments for this project. If there is fund crunch, the PMC deposits money of its own. But due to technicality of financial year closure, the money could not deposited in the account. The issue will be sorted out in a day or two,” he said.
