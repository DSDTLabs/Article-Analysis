 Ludhiana: Even as the Northern Railways has deposited the remaining compensation amount it owed to a Ludhiana district farmer, the latter’s advocate said the relief was less and that they would request the court not to release the attached property till the entire compensation was paid. 
 
 The court of additional district and sessions judge Jaspal Verma had attached Swarna Shatabdi Express and station superintendent office after the Northern Railways failed to comply with its 2015 order on enhanced compensation of Rs.1.05 crore to the aggrieved farmer, whose land was acquired for laying tracks. With the order, Katana village farmer Sampuran Singh got the train and office as relief till the payment was made. 
 
 The Northern Railways advocate, Iqbal Singh, confirmed that they had deposited Rs 73,90,036 in the court of additional session judge on March 31. “We have now filed an application for the release of the attached property. We have also filed a writ petition in the high court about the compensation being on the higher side. The case will come up for hearing in district courts on April 7,” he added.
 
 The farmer’s advocate, Rakesh Gandhi, said, “We have learned that the Northern Railways has deposited about Rs 75 lakh as compensation to the farmer. The railways didn’t discuss with us the compensation amount, as a result the payment is short of Rs 30 lakh. We will request the court not to release the attached property till the full payment is made.” 
 
 The local court on March 18 had given three weeks to Northern railways to compensate the farmer. On March 16, the court officials had attached Swarna Shatbadi train, which runs between Amritsar and Delhi, at Ludhiana railway station and office of station superintendent after the railways failed to pay the entire compensation for the land acquired from the farmer.
