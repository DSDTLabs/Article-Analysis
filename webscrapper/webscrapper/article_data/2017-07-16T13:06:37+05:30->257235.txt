KOLHAPUR:The   (RTO) is planning to build   tracks in Inchalkaranji and Gadhinglaj for the convenience of vehicle owners in rural Kolhapur.

 The RTO recently gave permission to build a brake testing track in Morewadi village near Kolhapur city.
 
 Brake testing is a prerequisite for obtaining vehicle fitness certificate. The Kolhapur transport   did not a track of its own until the district administration recently gave its permission for the testing track in the adjoining village.
 
 Regional Transport Officer (RTO) D T Pawar said, “Brake testing track is required to conduct the fitness test of vehicles. An unfit vehicle cannot run on the road. Many vehicle owners from   are forced to travel to the city for the test, which is a time consuming process. Thus, we are planning to build brake testing tracks in Ichalkaranji and Gadhinglaj for the convenience of vehicle owners. We have held primary discussions with respective local governing authorities. Once we get the land, we can send the proposal seeking funds from the government. It would be a big relief for heavy vehicle owners.”
 
 However, vehicle unions have hailed the concept of transport office. The president of the Kolhapur district lorry association   said, “Our members have to come from their respective villages. It takes time due to a higher number of vehicles. Therefore, the pressure should equally be distributed for smooth functioning.”
