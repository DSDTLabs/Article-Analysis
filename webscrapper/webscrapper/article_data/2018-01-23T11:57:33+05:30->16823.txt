While the movies gain the most attention, every Star Wars fan knows the galaxy is explored far more in the books. They fill in what happened between movies, tell us the backstories or sidestories of characters we wished to see more of and they took us to planets never visited. They're also countless guides and encyclopedia's, filling us in on the history, geography or character profiles. The Star Wars Franchise is an old one, starting when the first (chronologically fifth) movie released in 1977. The book's first article is from 1973 however- a feature about George Lucas, where he reveals that he was working on a film set in space.
