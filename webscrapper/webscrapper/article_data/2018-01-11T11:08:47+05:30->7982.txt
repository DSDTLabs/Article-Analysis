SHILLONG:   Narendra Modi is likely to campaign in the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo Hills after the dates of the Meghlaya assembly election are announced, said a source in BJP. 

  Shibun Lyngdoh said, "It is at the level of proposal and nothing has been finalized yet. Moreover, the selection of venue will be known only after getting a confirmation from the PM." He added that other party leaders and ministers will also visit the state to campaign for the party. 
 
 On December 16, Modi had launched BJP's poll campaign in the state by addressing a 'rally for change' at the Polo Grounds here. The Prime Minister had taken a dig at chief minister Mukul Sangma for lack of progress in the health sector. BJP national president Amit Shah had also addressed an election rally at Tikrikilla in the Garo Hills. Shah had cited several cases of corruption in the state and had expressed optimism that BJP would fare well in the coming election. 
 
 On the other hand, Meghalaya's Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation initiative, 'Mission U Nite', has been shortlisted by the Election Commission as a nominee for National Awards, 2017, for creatively engaging the youth. In a statement, chief electoral officer Frederick Kharkongor said the aim was to get future voters to get themselves enrolled. Following the campaign, there was a net addition of 21,455 new voters on the electoral rolls. 
 
 "The election department is striving hard and leaving no stone unturned to ensure that no voter is left behind," said Kharkongor.
