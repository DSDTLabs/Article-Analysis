Chandrapur: Finally, darkness in tribal-dominated villages located deep inside the forests of Naxalite-infested Gadchiroli district are is all set to come to an end after 70 long years of Independence. Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has successfully electrified 30 out of the total 38 unelectrified villages it had identified for conventional electrification. Work in the remaining eight will be accomplished by March end. Kokameta Tola, a hamlet located more than 200 km from the district headquarters deep inside the jungles of Bhamragarh tehsil, was added to the tally of electrified villages on Tuesday. Despite the hamlet having only 11 houses, MSEDCL’s Bhamragarh sub-division laid 2.5-km-long high tension line and over 1km-long low tension line through the forest to take power to the village. So far, all these 11 families were using kerosene lamps to brighten their house. They all were provided power connections free of cost under Saubhagya scheme. Chief engineer Dilip Ghugal himself travelled through the forest up to the hamlet to formally switch on power supply to the village. Ghugal told TOI that a total of 66 non-electrified villages were identified in Gadchiroli district in a survey done back in December 2016. “Of these, 28 villages are located in such a difficult terrain and deep inside the forest that taking conventional power supply lines to them was impossible. Hence, these 28 villages were handed over to the Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) for electrification through non-conventional means like solar power. MSEDCL’s Chandrapur zone was shouldered with the task of remaining 38 villages, out of which 30 have been successfully electrified,” Ghugal claimed adding the remaining work will be accomplished within two months. MEDA officials in Nagpur also claimed that their work too is in final leg and would be completed in 2-3 months.
