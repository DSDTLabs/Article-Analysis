Coimbatore: The 10th edition of the week-long ‘Coimbatore Vizha’ will kick-start from Friday with events like movie fest, music fest, food fest and a tour around the city on a double-decker bus. 

 The organisers believe the double-decker ride would be a crowd-puller. People could hop on and hop off the bus wherever they want. It would take people on a guided tour to the city’s important landmarks like Perur Patteeswarar Temple, VOC Park and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.
 
 On food front, ‘Taste of Kovai’ would be held at VOC Park from January 5 to 7. In addition, city hotels would also conduct their own food festivals as part of the event.
 
 In the music fest, genres from classical to light music would come together at the PSG Institute of Management from January 5 to 8. 
 
 In the movie fest, open-air screening of movies from various languages will be held from January 8 to 11 at CODISSIA Complex. 
 
 Besides, this year’s edition would also have a street art fest on Scheme Road, Race Course. Established and budding street artists would take part in the event. Painting and photography exhibitions would also be held at various spots in the city.
 
 Seven streets in the city would be decorated with lights and danglers as part of ‘Vizha Veethi’ to give a festive look. Brookefields and Prozone malls would host a series of events as part of the event. For more details visit: www.coimbatorevizha.com.
