MADURAI: Directing the government to produce before it details regarding the procedure that pertains to re-laying of road, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday expressed concern and observed that the authorities were not removing the existing layers before re-laying them. Due to this, structures on those stretches have gone below the road level. 

 The court also impleaded the chief engineer of the public works department ( ) in another case, after it was told that the department failed to maintain proper measurements in flood canal project works carried out in   in Tirunelveli.
 
 One A M Sundaravel, working as work inspector grade II in Poigai Aaru Water Resources Scheme of public works department (PWD), filed a batch of two public interest litigations (PIL) including one relating to flood canal project works and another to bad condition of roads in   in Tirunelveli.
 
 They came up for admission before the division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and R Tharani.
 
 The petitioner appeared as party-in-person and said “The authorities concerned made a mistake in laying of new road and road re-laying works. The thickness of the road should be three inches, but such norms were not followed in many places. The court needs to examine the road works that were carried out in the last five years, through an expert team.”
 
 He also told the court that  , who worked as chief engineer in PWD’s water source, his successor S S  , and one Subbiah, working as executive engineer did not discharge their duty properly in carrying out flood canal project works in Nanguneri.
