GAYA: A weeklong anti-encroachment drive on eastern and western banks of Falgu river will commence on Monday. An estimated 1,500 illegal structures are to be removed during the operation being conducted to execute the Patna high court order.

 Pratjnya, a citizen group, had filed a PIL in the Patna high court demanding removal of encroachments from the Falgu river banks. It was pleaded that the encroachments had significantly narrowed the width of the river and blocked some channels of water retention in what geologists believed to be a bowl like formation that stores water and facilitates sub-surface flow of water in the perennially dry river. 
 
 The PIL stated that nearly half a million residents of the town directly or indirectly depend on Falgu for their water needs. Sources claimed that while nearly 40% of the 70,000 holdings registered with   water through municipal taps, the remaining population privately draws groundwater and Falgu remains its main source.
 
 The drive would cover areas falling under six different police stations of   sadar subdivision, including  , Civil Lines and Muffasil police station.
 
 As per the detailed order issued by the legal cell of the SDO office, Lalit Bhushan Ranjan, deputy collector (land revenue) will be the in charge of the entire drive. Twelve armed constables, 50 lathi-yielding constables and 12 women constables have also been deployed for the purpose.
 
 Besides the DCLR, the circle officers and supply officers concerned have also been deputed for the operation. Starting from Muffasil police station area on April 2, the drive will end in the Kotwali police station area on April 10.
