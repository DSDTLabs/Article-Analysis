LUCKNOW: Gomti Barrage will remain closed for public use for another three months because of heavy damage caused to the road during construction of the river front below the bridge. The contractor had pushed huge concrete boxes into the soil on   to cut the earth horizontally and make way for intercepting drains. 

 While pushing the boxes forward, the road's soil started caving in and a huge crater was formed on the approach road of Gomti Barrage  . The road also started showing cracks as a result of construction below the bridge. To prevent further damage, government sent a special team comprising principal secretary, engineer-in-chief, chief engineer etc of the irrigation department to the site on Monday to carry out inspection. 
 
 The team found that the contractor had also caused damage to Gomti Barrage approach road and its repair would take about 3 months' time. Engineer-in-chief, irrigation department, PK Singh said, "The contractor used push box technology to go faster but since the bank's soil is loose, it gave in to the heavy thrusting and earth started caving in from side of Gomti Barrage. We have asked him to give us an alternative plan of action and also repair road within deadline." 
 
 Officials said the riverfront construction and repair would be completed by April 2017. This road was closed a month back. Meanwhile, public is being asked to use 1090 crossing to move to and from Dalibagh.
 
 Lucknow division executive engineer Surendra Kumar told TOI "Since the contractor has damaged the road, he would be liable to reconstruct it too," he said. 
 
 Contractor Vivek Chopra said he would be able to complete construction and repair road by March 15.
