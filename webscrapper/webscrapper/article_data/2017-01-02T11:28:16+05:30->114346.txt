RANCHI: Holding   under the   will soon be replaced with   The 15-digit   will be issued following   by the end of February. 

 Additional municipal commissioner Bidyanand Sharma Pankaj said, "The self-assessment will help us prepare a complete database of houses under the RMC area. Once that is done, we will provide a UID to every house. We will upload the same on the UID on RMC website to ensure that the landlord or owner has access to every detail of their house."
 
 The UID will provide the address, type of construction, number of floors, purpose of use, whether residential or commercial and much more. Every UID will have the house number and codes for streets and wards, making it easier for RMC officials to locate any house. 
 
 "The UID number will help RMC in tax assessment of any given property and at the same time, will help people to pay their property tax online by just entering their UID in the RMC website," Sharma said.
 
 Once a house is allotted the UID, the owner will not have to carry property-related documents with him anywhere. "One can just open the website, enter the UID and get a printout of the complete property details. However, this also makes the number very vulnerable and it should not be shared with anyone," Sharma said.
 
 The self-assessment of properties began in November and will end in February. Following this, RMC officials and private company Sparrow Infratech Ltd will visit every household to check the assessment done by individuals. 
 
 At present, there are around 2.5 lakh households in the city, of which only one lakh are registered with RMC. 
 
 Meanwhile, the RMC has also been directly linked with the   office. As a result, none of the property transaction will be hidden from the RMC and as soon as a property is registered, the RMC will provide a UID to the same.
