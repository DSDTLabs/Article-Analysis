COLVA: Following unsuccessful bids for a ticket from the Congress, South Goa zilla panchayat member   Rebello, filed her nomination for the Benaulim seat on the   (GVP) ticket. 

 Rebello, who drifted away from her mentor, Churchill Alemao, had made her intention of contesting from Benaulim clear over the last six months. She subsequently began scouting for a ticket from various political parties, but met with little success.
 
 When the   (AAP) made its presence felt in Goa, Rebello had expressed interest to contest the assembly election under its banner.
 
 But, when the ticket for Benaulim was allotted to Royla Fernandes, Rebello dialled Congress. She participated in its ‘Jan Jagruti Padyatra’ in December and involved herself in door-to-door campaigning. The Congress, however, declared Edwin Barreto as its candidate from Benaulim.
