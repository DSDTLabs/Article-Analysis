NEW DELHI: To resist the May 5, 2016   gazette notification and its implementation at the  , the JNU Students Union, along with students of   and Jamia Millia Islamia, protested outside the UGC building on Friday, against UGC’s “draconian eligibility criteria and entry rules.”

 Protestors outside the UGC building demanded rollback of the notification which they believe will lead to seat cuts and discrimination in the PhD and M.Phil admissions. The students said that the weightage for viva should be reduced, which is at 100% after the new notification.
 
 JNUSU president Mohit Pandey, on behalf of JNUSU, presented a letter to the UGC chairman where they expressed “reservations and apprehensions about the UGC 2016 regulations.”
 
 The letter stated that the UGC notification “grossly compromises the autonomy of universities, particularly those like JNU which are already following a rigorous and far more socially inclusive admission policy evolved through decades of students’ struggle, dialogue and research.”
 
 According to JNUSU, the adoption of the UGC notification will “undermine JNU’s unique and decades-old deprivation point system in admissions, the Prof. Nafey Committee Recommendations to reduce viva weightage in M.Phil. and PhD admissions and other provisions,” the letter read.
