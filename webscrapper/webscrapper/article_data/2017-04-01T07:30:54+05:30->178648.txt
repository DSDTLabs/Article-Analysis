GURGAON: After facing parents’ ire over increase in school  , some private school principals came out on Friday and expressed their disappointment at the current “onslaught” and also accused the media of under-representing them.

 “Some   have alleged that we haven’t declared our income, expenses and facilities through Form VI, which helps in calculation of the school fees. This is false as every detail is available on our website,” said Sandhya Awasthi, principal,  .
 
 “In fact we are abiding by all the rules and regulations of Haryana Education Act 2003,” Awasthi added.
 
  also rubbished reports that they were engaged in the oppression of parents. “The implementation of 7th pay commission and payment of arrears to teachers from January 2016, have impacted the finances of unaided schools, and their running costs have gone up,” explained Sunita Nagpal, principal,  , Sushant Lok. 
 
 GS Matharoo, group CEO of   school, that was also embroiled in the controversy last week, said, “We have our own registered parent-teacher associations and we dutifully discuss all the details with them before making any fee  .”
 
 Meanwhile, several parents alleged that their children, studying in private schools, are being harassed. 
 
 “We did not pay the development fee as the school failed to explain us why it was being charged. Consequently they withheld the result,” said Sandeep Vats, whose son studies in Ryan International School in Sector 31. 
 
 “We deny all such allegations.   cards were issued to all students, except the ones who were absent on March 25 (the result day),” said J Singh, principal, Ryan International School, Sector 31.
