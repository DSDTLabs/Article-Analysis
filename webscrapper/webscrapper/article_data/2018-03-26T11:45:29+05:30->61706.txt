 The students got a chance to dance on Bollywood numbers with Rooh band on the first day. They also had a ball on the second day with the performance of Indian Ocean. “Our event was successful because the security wasn’t hampered in any way. We made sure that the security was tight at the front gate and the entry of outsiders was only allowed through passes hence the crowd was manageable. And I think the event was bigger and better as promised,” said Ruchika Chaurasia, treasurer of the students’ union. 
 Mahima Vaid, president of the students’ union, added, “We are thankful to our principal for her support and appreciation. I think we tried to give everything to the crowd in terms of the music genres. Whether it was Rooh which performed on Bollywood numbers or Indian Ocean, our fest had a bit of both the genres which was appreciated by everyone.”
