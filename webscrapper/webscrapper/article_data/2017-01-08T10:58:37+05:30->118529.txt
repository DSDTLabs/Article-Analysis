KOLKATA: The state has planned to set up an institute to take care of the requirements of a new township. The institute, which will comprise architects, planners, IT experts and government officials, will have a panel of experts from IIT and  , a forum of Indian industry. 

 Additional chief secretary   said the idea of setting up such an institute was conceived by chief minister  . He admitted that often townships lack proper infrastructure because there is hardly any cooperation among the state’s architects, planners, IT consultants and government officials during the initial stages. Sen, who is also in charge of HIDCO and Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, said that during the creation of townships, the institute will play a major part to make it a model township. 
 
 “We often ignore the role of IT while making plans for a new town. On one hand, we must provide the residents with eco-friendly dwelling units, transport and on the other hand, we should also fulfil their IT requirements,” Sen said. 
 
 Speaking on behalf of Ranbir and   and Management, a wing of IIT-Kharagpur,  , a professor in the civil engineering department, said that studies were being conducted to find better designs for future cities or towns in India.
