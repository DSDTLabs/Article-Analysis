Madurai: The city corporation is planning to set up a de-addiction centre in a bid to help rehabilitate those struggling to wean themselves off drug and alcohol.

 The proposed facility will have 20 beds and will have facilities to cater for drug addicts having a a poor financial background. The corporation will set up the new venture with the help of M S Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation. The trust will work with psychiatrists and qualified counsellors. The civic body and the trust have already been working jointly on a project called ‘Happy Schooling’ to identify the mental health problems among the children studying in schools run by civic corporation.
 
 “While the required facility would be created by the city corporation, the technical part will be taken care of by the trust, which is known for its work in the mental health field. We have applied for an approval. The facility will start functioning immediately after getting it,” an official said. A centre with 10-bed facility had functioned in Kodikulam, but was closed down later for want of qualified psychiatrists. The de-addiction centre was opened in 2012 and was a success in the initial years. Around 380 persons benefitted from the centre in just one year before being converted into Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC).
 
 Officials from the health wing of the Madurai city corporation said that they were planning to set up the facility at the UPHC. While the regular activity will take place on the ground floor, the centre would be operated in the first.
