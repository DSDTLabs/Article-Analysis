THANE: A 59-year-old man was   after a   truck rammed into him while he was crossing the road at Rutu Enclave in Ghodbunder Road on Tuesday morning at 8.30am. 

 This is the third hit-and-run case reported in recent times. A few days ago, a woman was run over by a speeding car that was driven by a teenager at Hiranandani Estate.
 
 In both the cases, the accused did not stop back to help the victims. 
 
 The 59-year-old man, who has been identified as Hari Pawar, was a resident of Rutu Enclave. He was a retired school teacher and was on his way to   station.
 
 “Hari Pawar was crossing the road when a speeding truck heading towards Thane station rammed into him. The man at the wheel did not stop to help Pawar; instead fled from the scene. Passers-by then rushed to the victim’s aide and took him to a nearby hospital. However, he succumbed to his injuries. We are going to check if any of the bystanders noticed the vehicle’s registration number. On the basis of this we can track down the accused,” said an officer from   police station.
 
 Similarly, another hit and run incident occurred on Saturday evening in which a boy suffered serious injuries after a car rammed into him.
 
 “Sandesh Gavde (38) was riding his motorcycle and heading towards Mumbai with a friend when a speeding car rammed into him near Nitin Company. The accused did not stop to help the duo who had fallen off their bike. Gavde suffered injuries on his chin and hands,” said an officer from Naupada police station. In both cases, the accused have been booked under various sections for rash driving and under sections of the motor vehicle act.
