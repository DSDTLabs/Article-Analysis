As the audience swayed along, Hyderabadi theatre artiste,   suddenly got up and danced to its rhythm.

Two music videos of Kooky — Eve 2 and Holdup — were screened first after which Kooky herself took to the stage to recite some poetry.

 Kooky, who is visiting Hyderabad for the second time ,said, “I love the food and people of Hyderabad. As far as I’m concerned I get to know the city if I know the people. The people here are amazing and supportive. That’s why I'm here again.”
