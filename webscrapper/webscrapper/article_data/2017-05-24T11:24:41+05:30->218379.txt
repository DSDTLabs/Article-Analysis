LUDHIANA: To check drunken driving, the Ludhiana police have decided to present the final report (kalandra) of offenders in the court rather than registering an FIR. With this, the violator would be presented before the court, where he would get immediate punishment, which could be a fine or imprisonment.

 The traffic police have been holding special challan drives and have conducted raids at several restaurants on  , near  . So far in 2017, 693 drunk driving challans have been issued. 
 
 ADGP (traffic) MK Tiwari had recently launched body cameras in Ludhiana, a first in  , for cops to keep an eye on   who misbehaved with them.
 
  said, “Drunken driving is the main reason for accidents and our motive is to end it. Challan drives are not enough. Therefore, Wednesday onwards, anyone caught driving in inebriated condition would not be booked, but produced in the court. In such cases, the court gives decision on the same day.”
 
 Earlier, the drunk drivers drove back home after being challaned for the offence. But now, if the offender is caught late in the evening, he would remain in police custody overnight and would be produced in court the next morning.
