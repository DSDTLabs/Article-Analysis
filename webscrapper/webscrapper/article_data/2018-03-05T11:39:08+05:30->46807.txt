 The extension of the train service has opened a direct link between the suburbs of Hyderabad and Vijayawada, bringing cheers to scores of Vijayawada natives living in places such as like Kukatpalli. From now on, people going to Vijayawada can board the train from Zaheerabad, Vikarabad and Lingampalli stations, instead of coming all the way to Secunderabad.
