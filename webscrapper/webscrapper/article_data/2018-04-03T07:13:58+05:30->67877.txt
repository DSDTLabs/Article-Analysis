HYDERABAD: After a   administrator was picked up by some persons suspected to be policemen in civil dress, his supporters took to social media demanding that he be released immediately.

 Prashant, administrator of ‘Spirit of Telangana’, which is a Facebook group with 20,000 followers, was reportedly picked up by the Hyderabad police from an office premises in Banjara Hills on Monday afternoon.
 
 
 Members of the social media group posted the administrator’s photo on Facebook stating that police took away Prashant, who came from a poor family and was working to create awareness among the public by exposing the corrupt activities of those in power. However, when contacted senior city police department officials refuted allegations that task force police had picked Prashant up.
 
 
 Later in the night task force DCP P Radhakrishan Rao confirmed to TOI that Prashant had been called for questioning by their team in relation to a complaint recieved by the Banjara Hills police about his derogatory Facebook posts against the state government and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. "We verified with the   police and since the offence of Prashant was not cognizable we let him go,” the DCP said.
