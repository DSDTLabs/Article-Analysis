Vellore: Nearly 100 members of the zone III of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) and   Employees Union (TUEU) staged a hunger   on Thursday, demanding action against the university’s vice-chancellor K Murugan and his subordinates for indulging in malpractice.

 The government college professors and members of the AUT and TN Government College Teachers Association, said that the VC, registrar (in-charge) V Peruvalluthi and controller of examination (in-charge) B Senthil Kumar have been indulging in large scale corruption in the appointment of teaching and non-teaching faculties to various departments of the university and its six constituent colleges.
 
 For the last 15 years, the officials of the varsity had not called in for tenders in accordance with the provisions of the Tender Transparency Act, said honorary president of TUEU prof I Elangovan. “Since the inception of the university in 2002, the Act had been violated and we demand that the purchase of materials so far be probed into by the DVAC,” he continued.
 
 The members of the AUT condemned the university for outsourcing exam preparatory works, right from generating hall tickets to issuing degree certificates and provisional certificates. 
 
 “The university is paying Rs 2.50 crore per semester to Chennai based private firm ABACUS Logistics Pvt Ltd. since November 2013, for the work done by the university staff for around Rs 15 lakh,” he added.
 
 They demanded the government to order a probe by the DVAC into the alleged corruption involving the present and former VCs, registrars and controller of examination.
