AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday granted   to the   of state for rural housing and rural development,  , in connection with a   ahead of the state assembly polls.

 Khabad, who contested election from Devgadh Baria constituency, was booked in a case of rioting and firing, and had approached the high court for pre-arrest bail after the elections. On January 23, the HC stayed police from taking any coercive action against him.
 
 After he was denied relief by a court of sessions in Limkheda, Khabad sought anticipatory bail from the HC requesting it to impose conditions and submitted that he was willing to abide by all conditions.
 
 Interestingly, the lawyer representing the state government opposed Khabad’s application on the ground that the offence registered against the minister is of a grave nature.
 
 After hearing the case, Justice A J Desai granted anticipatory bail to Khabad on furnishing bail bond of Rs 10,000. He will have to surrender his passport to the local court and can go abroad only with the court’s permission. He should also not try to influence witnesses and hamper investigation, the HC said.
