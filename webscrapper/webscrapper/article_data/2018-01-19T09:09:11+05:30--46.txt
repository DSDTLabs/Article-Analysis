JOHANNESBURG: On one hand, he refuses to guarantee long-term commitment to Test cricket. On the other, he walks into the side and makes all the difference when it matters most. That's AB de Villiers, the maverick South African superstar batsman. His team can't do without him but they never know when they'll run out of that choice.

 A batsman for all formats and every season, AB scored two brisk half-centuries in both the Tests that made all the difference for his team. His 65 off 84 balls in the first innings of the first Test got South Africa out of the early trouble while his 80 in the second innings of the second Test helped his team hand India a target they couldn't chase.
 
 Asked how he manages to come and play so positively, especially coming from a break, AB has a simple philosophy: "I just watch the ball and I just play." He clearly doesn't believe there's a difference between the three formats that cricket caters to - Tests, ODIs & T20 - and he doesn't have to force himself to keep changing his style.
 
 "It is just a mindset applying yourself to the wicket and conditions and that's always been the way that I have played. So no, definitely it's not something that I force myself to do."
 
 Ahead of the  , there was a hint of a discussion where the relatively younger  's name came up as a possible replacement to the 'disinterested' AB. But hear the latter out and he says he's absolutely enjoying every bit of this.
 
 "Test cricket is the ultimate challenge, it was very enjoyable to be a part of a really important and good series win. I am obviously enjoying my cricket and loving it out there with the boys. And it has been a great couple of Test matches," he says. He's chipped off five grams off his bat and is already feeling lighter. "If the bat feels good... it's all about the feel," said AB.
 
 About the team, he said, "There is confidence and fresh air of energy in the side."
