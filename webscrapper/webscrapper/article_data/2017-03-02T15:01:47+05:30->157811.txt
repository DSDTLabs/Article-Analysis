Singer Cher has said she regrets not going to Las Vegas to meet   when he asked her. 

 The 'Believe' singer has always been a huge fan of the late rock icon, but she said she was nervous about seeing him face-to-face.
 
  
  
 "Well I heard things. My mom took me to see him when I was, like, 10 or 11 and it was so exciting and I remember that all the girls were standing up screaming on their chairs and I hadn't gotten to that point yet," she said on a US chat show.
 
 "I wasn't sure what that whole thing was, but I said to my mom, 'Can we stand up on our chairs and scream?' My mom said, 'Sure let's do that'. I was screaming for him before I even knew why I was screaming for him. There's two ( ) I regret not (meeting)...   and him", she added.
