After playing a grandfather in ' ' for eight long years,   is now looking forward to playing younger characters. He says, “I have not done anything apart from this show for so long, but now I’m itching to do something different. I got to portray a variety of emotions through my character in 'Yeh Rishta…', but now, I want to play my age. In fact, I’d love do a negative role which will give me a break from the father figure image.” 
With his shoot schedule considerably shortened, Sanjeev is making the most of his free time. He is planning to take off on long bike rides in the next few weeks. He says, “Be it cars or  , I am all for road travel, even if it means I have to go alone.” However, he admits that he misses spending as much time with his reel family. “Whenever I sit back and tell my kids about my shows, this one will top the list. Also, the highlight will be meeting   (Saberwal, who played his wife on the show) and getting married to her. The show is so much a part of our lives that we cannot remove it from our system.”
