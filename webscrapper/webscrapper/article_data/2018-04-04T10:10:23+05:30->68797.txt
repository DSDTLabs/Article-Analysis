NEW DELHI: The 30-share BSE   on Wednesday went past the 33,400-mark after opening flat.   too, was trading above the 10,250-mark in early trading.

 
 The Street has gained more than 300 points in the first two trading sessions of this financial year and has warded off the volatility in global markets. In morning trade,   stocks were outperforming with the Nifty auto sub-index gaining more than a per cent. Investors may look forward to the   policy meet which starts today.
 
 Brokers said sentiments remained firm largely on the back of sustained buying by DIIs as well as retail investors and positive cues from other Asian cues, tracking gains on the Wall Street.
