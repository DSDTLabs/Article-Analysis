Nagpur: Professionals from different fields and homemakers showcased their talent during ‘Sadabahar Nagme’, a music programme organized by Aavishkar Kala Sanstha, at Scientific Society Hall, Laxmi Nagar, on Friday.

 Young vocalist Janhvi Haridas flagged off the show with enchanting ‘Suno sajna’ from movie ‘Aaye Din Bahar Ke’. Ashwini Lule presented ‘Mere dil ne jo maanga mil gaya’ in her sweet voice that set the mood for rest of the evening. Peppy number ‘Kaisi paheli zindagani’ from the 2005 movie ‘Parineeta’ presented by Dr Seema Naik had the audience cheering. 
 
 ‘Dil toh hai dil’, sung by Varsha Mokha and ‘Gali mein aaj chand nikla’ left the audience sway to its melody. ‘Tu jahan jahan chalega’ by Charanshila Trikande and ‘Naino mein badara chhaye’ by Shreeta Bansod from ‘Mera Saaya’ had a gripping effect.
 
 ‘Unse mili nazar’ from ‘Jhuk Gaya Aasma’ by Veena Khandekar was the highlight of the evening. Nearly 26 foot-tapping compositions of Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle and music directors like Shankar Jaikishen, Madan Mohan and Lakshmikant Pyarelal were sung. Many hit songs from the blockbuster movies like ‘Refugee’, 1965 movie ‘Waqt’ and ‘Yakeen’ were also presented.
 
 Loud cheers of ‘once more’ reverberated the hall as tributes were paid to the late actress Sridevi by Janhvi who presented ‘Hawa Hawai’ with ease. 
 
 The programme, that represented different eras of film music, was conceptualized by Smita Joshi. Shweta Shelgaonkar was the anchor.
