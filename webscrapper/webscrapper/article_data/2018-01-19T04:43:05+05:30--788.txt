MUMBAI: Officials from BMC’s B ward, which includes   and Dongri, were shocked when they found their   renewal documents being fraudulently replicated. It emerged that a shop-owner, instead of paying Rs 2,075 as projection fees to  , was duped into paying Rs 14,930. The   office has demanded a police case be registered and it be thoroughly probed.

 BMC charges a projection fees to shops for them to showcase few items which they keep on sale for customers.
 
 Officials from B ward on January 17 received a request from a shop-owner at Sarang Street to renew his projection fees for the year. The citizen facilitation centre (CFC) officials of BMC allowed him to renew it by telling him to pay a licence fee of Rs2,075. But the shop-owner was taken aback and demanded a refund from BMC, claiming that last year he was made to pay Rs14,930.
 
 Assistant municipal commissioner (B ward) Udaykumar Shirookar said, “We suspected something was wrong and immediately told him to get last year’s receipt. We found that he had been fraudulently forced into paying enormously more. However, our concern was that he person who got the   to pay more actually prepare the same document like ours, with our logo and senior licence inspector’s sign incorporated. We are afraid that many more people may have been duped into paying large amounts to BMC even when the civic body actually does not charge so much. Therefore, we want it to be investigated and have moved the local police,” said Shirookar.
 
 On Thursday, a person came with the same receipt of the shop-owner and said that he did not want a refund. “We took him to the police station as we suspect he could be the agent who duped the shopkeepers. We are yet to trace the actual owner of the shop,” said Shirookar, adding that it is always better if people pay by cheque such fees directly to BMC, considering that a cheque always has to be drawn out in BMC’s name only.
