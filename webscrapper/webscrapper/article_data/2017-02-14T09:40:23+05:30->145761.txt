CHANDIGARH/ROHTAK: To prevent venues of Jat protests from escalating into violence, police on Monday registered an FIR against a youth for brandishing a gun at the ‘Jat Nyay Dharna’ at Jassia on Sunday. 

 The case was registered at Rohtak Sadar police station under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and Arms Act on a complaint lodged by a head constable on duty at the dharna site.
 
 The heavy presence of police and paramilitary forces at the protest venue had done little to deter the gun-wielding youth at Jassia. Although Section 144 of the CrPC, which prohibits assembly of more than four people, is clamped along the national highway, protesters had staged a huge demonstration in the presence of police.
 
 “As per information, it was a pellet gun,” Rohtak superintendent of police Pankaj Nain said. However, legal action would be taken against the youth for brandishing the gun, he added.
 
 AIJASS chief Yashpal Malik, too, blamed the media for dubbing the airgun as a rifle. About traffic disruption, he said such things are common during such large gatherings.
 
 The February 2016 Jat stir had left 30 people dead as protest spun out of control and violence swept the state. Protesters had targeted properties owned by non-Jats and disrupted rail and road traffic.
