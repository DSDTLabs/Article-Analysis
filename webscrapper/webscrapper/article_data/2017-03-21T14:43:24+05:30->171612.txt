While we all went aww at the commendable transition of our "Darling"   in 'Baahubali' series, not many of us know as to how the actor managed to look so bulky to suit the characters of Amerendra   and Mahendra Baahubali, on-screen. This article gives a low down on the details about the actor's workout plan including his diet and how much it costed the producers of the movie.

 It is learnt that the makers of the magnum opus have spent as much as Rs 15 crore, solely to sculpt the physique of Prabhas. 
 
 Mr World 2010 title winner Lakshman Reddy supervised the actor's diet and workouts which included 6 to 8 meals on a day with the right kind of protein and fats. The actor was strictly deprived of any junk or indulgent food that he longed for, all these five years.
 
 He was put on a diet that included dozens of eggs, fish, chicken, mutton, fruits, nuts and vegetables along with supplements. Also, Prabhas, who lifted heavy weights in regular sessions was made to adjust his workout schedules at midnight, due to shooting schedules. The makers of the film, Arka Media Works have ensured that the characters look their part and therefore not withstanding anything, have spent a bomb for the same. 
 
 The recently released trailer of the movie has set new records and the character Devasena played by Anushka stole the show by looking quite ravishing and elegant at the same time.
 
 Meanwhile, the movie, is going to hit the screens on April 28. The post-production works are currently on.
