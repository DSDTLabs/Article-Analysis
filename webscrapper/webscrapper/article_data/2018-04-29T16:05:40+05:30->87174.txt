Considered to be among the fittest stars in Hollywood,   is known to be extremely fitness conscious. In fact, the actor is said to go to bed by 9 pm and wake up at the crack of dawn for his stringent workout regimen. Over the years, Akshay has been vocal about his love for fitness and has often spoken about his martial arts background as well. Known to do his own stunts, Akshay makes sure he never misses his workout, and even encourages those close to him to remain fit and active. 
With the country reeling under the scorching heat currently, working out isn’t exactly on the top of people’s to-do list. Akshay, on the other hand, has not only devised a way to stay fit but also ensured that he has fun while he’s at it. The actor recently put up a video of himself where he is swimming with weights. While swimming in itself is a great exercise, adding weights to it is not something that everyone does. 
 While posting the video, he wrote, “Nothing like a dip in the pool in the scorching summers. Here I am swimming with weights... please ensure you’re good at swimming to attempt this. It’s a great leg workout and helps in overall core building. #FitIndia”
