New Delhi: BJP’s Delhi Pradesh general secretary, Kuljeet  , along with MP Udit Raj in a press conference on Monday slammed the AAP-led government for delaying the pace of development under the central schemes.

 “It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Centre continued to grant   for the development of Delhi and its CM continued to deprive the people of their benefits,” they said.
 
 Chahal said that the Centre has framed several welfare schemes in the past three years, but it has not yet been implemented in the capital.
 
 “We want to highlight four prominent schemes for which funds were granted, but the people were devoid of their benefits due to delaying tactics of the Kejriwal government. Schemes like Swachh Bharat Mission, Amrit Jal Yojana, Road Transport Infrastructure Development Scheme and expansion of Delhi Metro in Phase-IV were all granted funds, but the Delhi government has delayed these projects for their own political tactics,” Chahal said.
 
 Raj said that the Centre had released Rs 29.97 crore for construction of toilets under the Swachh Bharat Mission, but it has not been utilised.
 
 “Delhi government received 11,128 applications for the construction of toilets, but work has been initiated only for 22 of them. Similarly, for the solid waste management, Centre had released Rs 63.11 crore and Rs 200 crore was pending. The fund has not been utilised and the government has not submitted utilisation certificates even for Rs 1 out of this fund,” said Raj.
 
 “Under Amrut Jal Yojna, Rs 900 crore was sanctioned in 2016-17 for laying new pipelines and sewer lines in areas including Sonia Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Rajiv Nagar, Sriram Colony, Budh Vihar, Rithala, Bhalaswa, Rohini, Okhla, Rajghat to Greater Kailash, Palla and Shahdara but work is yet to start on these schemes,” Chahal added.
