NAVI MUMBAI: Traffic movement was thrown out of gear for about four hours on the Pune-bound carriageway of the Expressway on Saturday morning. 

 Officials said breakdown of a heavy vehicle at   led to bumper to bumper traffic for over three kilometres up to Saymal (NH-4 junction) from around 5.30 am till 10 am. The expressway saw a large number of vehicles as it's a weekend.
 
 State   (SHTP) superintendent of police Vijay Patil said, "Traffic movement was stopped to tow away the trailer that broke down. Thereafter, the traffic movement was restored to normal but heavy flow of vehicles led to a slowdown in the movement."
 
 Patil added, "The road gradient at the ghat section increases from normal 2.5 feet to 5 feet causing a slowdown. Also one lane is reduced at the Amrutanjan bridge, which added to the woes even though we cleared a portion on the left side to create more space for vehicles."
 
 Yogesh Jhunjhunwala, a motorist, tweeted at 7.48 am: "Extreme traffic on Mumbai Pune Expressway ghats towards Pune! Traffic snarls up to 1 hour. Please leave early as the traffic is increasing every movement!"
 
 Rescue activist   said, "Normally it takes three to four minutes to cross the stretch. There were many buses on the expressway heading for a religious congregation at Aurangabad from Friday evening causing traffic snarls throughout Friday night." An SHTP control room staffer said, "The traffic movement continued to remain slow till evening and throughout Saturday."
 
 The congregation started on Saturday at Limbe Jalgaon in   taluka, 24 km away from Aurangabad. The three-day congregation is expected to see over 20 lakh people from across the nation.
