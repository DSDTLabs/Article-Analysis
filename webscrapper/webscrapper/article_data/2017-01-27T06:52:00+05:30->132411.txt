Belagavi: An angry  , the small-scale industries minister, blamed Belagavi (Rural) MLA   for the recent   on his residence and firms associated with him. The duo faced each other at the District Stadium where the district administration had organized a   ceremony.

  After the national flag was hoisted, Jarkiholi minced no words to tell the BJP MLA: “I don’t engage in personal politics, but you have done that. For a politician like you, it’s not right to raise personal transactions. You are behind the I-T raid on me. You are playing such dirty politics when ‘shani’ is sitting on your shoulder. Such type of politics doesn’t suit you.”
 
 In his bid to stave off the controversy, Patil said it was one of his followers who alerted the enforcement directorate on KPCC women’s morcha president  . “But I have not complained against you,” said Patil, adding that he has his own business interests. However, the minister was not convinced.
 
 A few days ago, followers of Laxmi Hebbalkar, including her brother Channaraj Hattiholi, allegedly attacked the residence of Sanath Kumar Vattakki, a close follower of Patil, for complaining to the ED. An FIR was registered in Tilakwadi police station.
