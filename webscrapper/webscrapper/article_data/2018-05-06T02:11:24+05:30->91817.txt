GURUGRAM: A man was arrested for allegedly strangling his five-months-pregnant wife with a power cable after an argument in   on Friday. He went to a police station and surrendered on Saturday morning. 

 The accused has been identified as Ajay Kumar (30), a daily wager. Originally from UP, he was living with his wife Sandhya (27) in a rented accomodation in Saini Kunj, Bhondsi. 
 
 This was Sandhya’s second marriage. She had married Ajay’s brother several years ago, and later married Ajay in 2016 after his death. 
 
 According to police, Sandhya had a 4-year-old daughter from her first marriage, who is living with her maternal relatives in UP. The couple had been living in Bhondsi for the last one and a half years, and Sandhya was five months  . 
 
 An argument broke out between the couple over some issue late on Friday night, cops said. Ajay allegedly strangled his wife with a cable in a fit of anger. 
 
 Early the next morning, Ajay turned up at Bhondsi police station, saying he had murdered his wife, and surrendered. 
 
 He was detained and a police team went to his house, where they discovered Sandhya’s body as well as the cable used to strangle her. 
 
 After being informed about the murder, Sandhya’s brother Yogender, a resident of Aligarh, arrived in Bhondsi and filed a police complaint. 
 
 He alleged that although Ajay and Sandhya had initially been happy in the marriage, Ajay had been picking up fights with Sandhya and mentally torturing her for the past few months. On the basis of his complaint, an FIR was lodged against Ajay under Section 302 (murder) of IPC at Bhondsi police station on Saturday.
 
 “We have arrested the accused, who has confessed to murdering his wife. He will be produced before a duty magistrate on Sunday,” said inspector Umesh Kumar, SHO of Bhondsi police station.
