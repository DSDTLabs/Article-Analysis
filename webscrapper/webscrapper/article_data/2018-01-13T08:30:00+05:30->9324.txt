 The commission will take a decision on considering the proposed hike after interacting with the residents of the city.
 
 In the past five years, the commission has revised power tariff only twice – 2012-13 and 2015-16— and turned down the petition on three occasions on the ground that the department had failed to submit certain audited accounts.

 Delay in filing tariff petition
 
 Despite being repeatedly pulled by the JERC, the department has again failed to file the petition within stipulated time period. For the ongoing financial year, the department had filed tariff petition on January 19, while in 2016 the petition was filed on February 29. The JERC in the latest tariff order noted: “Historically, the petitioner has never filed its petition on time. The commission now directs the petitioner to submit the subsequent tariff petitions on or before November 30 failing which the commission will be constrained to take appropriate action against the petitioner.”
