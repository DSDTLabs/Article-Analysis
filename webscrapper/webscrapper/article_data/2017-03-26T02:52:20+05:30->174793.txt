ALLAHABAD: For the first time after the crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses in UP, a representative of the   government admitted on Saturday that the move had resulted in loss of livelihood for many. 

 However,  , the medical and health minister in Yogi government, said those selling mutton, chicken and eggs had been affected due to the “negative propaganda” by the opposition. Accusing the opposition of giving the issue a political colour, Singh said the state government had never ordered the closure of legal slaughterhouses and licenced mutton and chicken shops. “Only those shops were closed down which were operating without a licence. I want to tell chicken, mutton and even egg sellers they need not worry if their shops have a valid licence,” he said. 
 
 Reports suggest that the crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses and butcher shops across the state has led to production of buffalo meat dipping by 40% and mutton by 30%.
