MANGALURU: After   was adjudged as India’s best city in solid waste management (SWM), the   (MCC) has plans to concentrate more on the   concept.

 Mayor   told TOI that the city corporation will give more emphasis on swachhata campaigns and thereby make Mangaluru India’s cleanest city. “I congratulate all our civic workers, contractors, officials and general public for extending cooperation to make the city’s solid waste management the best in the nation. We will put more emphasis on the swachhata abhiyan in the days to come. Our aim is to make Mangaluru the cleanest city,” he said.
 
 He added that a discussion in this regard will be held in the city corporation council meet, which will be held in the second week of June.
 
 MCC environment engineer Madhu S   said the city corporation has not yet received communication with regard to the award ceremony from the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA). The Swachh Survekshan-2018 assessed 4,203 urban local bodies and was organized by the MoHUA, under the aegis of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban). The on-field survey for Swachh Survekshan-2018 was conducted by an independent agency appointed by the MoHUA, and the data for ranking of cities collected from three sources—service level progress, direct observation and citizen’s feedback. “The MCC is yet to receive an official invitation to receive the award,” he said, adding that the mayor and commissioner may receive the award.
 
 MCC has been taking up solid waste management through Antony Waste Handling Cell Private Limited and Unique Waste Processing Company Limited in the city. “All our pourakarmikas and other staff are also responsible for the effective management of solid waste in the city. We will continue our efforts and make necessary changes to improve the system,” he added.
