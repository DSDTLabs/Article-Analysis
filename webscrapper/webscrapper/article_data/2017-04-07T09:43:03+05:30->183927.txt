 UTTARKASHI: Landslides triggered by heavy rain wreaked havoc on many roads in   as vehicles were stuck for several hours on Thursday. Rishikesh-Badrinath highway was clogged with boulders at Gulabkoti, Baltora and Pinhola, leaving a long queue of vehicles and travellers. Some of them were stranded since Wednesday night. 
 
 "  (BRO) cleared the debris by Thursday afternoon," said Col P H Sharma, spokesperson of the organisation tasked with maintaining border roads. 
 
 The road leading to Badrinath was, however, still blocked at Lambagarh, where   (PWD) staff had been deployed to clear it. The highway leading to Gangotri also witnessed heavy landslides at Bhatwari, Dharashu and Bharoghati. BRO men used earthmovers to clear the roads on Thursday. 
 
 Ramavtar Singh, who was travelling from Varanasi to Gaumukh with his family, had to spend over 12 hours in his car at Bhatwari. "We slept in the car as there was no other option. It took BRO staff over three hours to clear the road," Singh told TOI.
 
  Several other parts of Garhwal also witnessed landslides as heavy showers lashed the region on the intervening night of Wed- nesday and Thursday. 
 
  Higher reaches of Garhwal also witnessed heavy snowfall on Wednesday which led the mercury to plunge by several notches.
