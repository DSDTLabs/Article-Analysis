Nagpur: A lecture ‘Stri santanchya kavyatil mukti sankalpana’ was held at Gram Geeta Bhavan in Nagpur University campus on Amaravti Road. The lecture was organized by Chair of Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj to remember literary works of female saints in India. Renowned writer and researcher   Bhawalkar was the keynote speaker at the programme.

 Addressing the gathering, Bhawalkar said, “Every Sant (saint) in India was considered as people’s leader or guru, because of their views towards society. Modern women libration, which started in 1975 has its roots in ancient works of saints in our country from twelfth to eighteenth century. The movement which started 400 to 500 years ago is still being carried out which means we are lacking somewhere.”
 
 Talking about the female saints in India, Bhawalkar said, “Meerabai, Janabai, Leleshwari, Muktabai and many more female literary contributed to the literature of saints in India. They have written numerous abhangs and bhajans. One thing that is common among them, is that they all believed in liberation and freedom of woman. Now-a-days, many believe that   is adapted from western culture but it has been a part of India’s traditions since ages.”
 
 “The ultimate weapon for society to oppress women is by using character. Women must accept who they are and forget the notion of what world will say,” added Bhawalkar.
 
 Women activist Rupa Kulkarni was the president of the programme, addressing audiences she said, “The concept of women saints in India goes back centuries ‘Before Christ’. At the time of Buddha and in many parts of Jain literature women saints have endorsed idea of freedom.”
 
 The organizers worked hard for the success of the event.
