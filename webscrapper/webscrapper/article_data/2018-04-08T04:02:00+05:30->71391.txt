Ahmedabad: The Bar Council of Gujarat (BCG) had a tough time on Saturday as it began counting of votes at Gujarat high court auditorium with four contesting candidates causing repeated interruption in the counting process for election of the 25-member body.

 The candidates started raising objections on various counts much before the counting began. Their tantrums led to more than an hour of delay. The candidatesâ€™ objections did not end and continued to mar the process throughout the day.
 
 The BCG election officials were so fed up that they called in police and arranged for high security in the campus to calm down aggressive candidates. The election observer, retired Justice D K Trivedi, had to shout against the candidates, but this too did not work.
 
 Finally, the election officials have decided that if the four candidates continue to disrupt the counting on Sunday, they will recommend cancellation of their candidature, said an election official.
