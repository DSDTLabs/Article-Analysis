KOLKATA: Police have filed a chargesheet in a local court against Union minister and   MP   on the basis of a complaint by TMC MLA Mahua Moitra in January alleging that Supriyo had used words and gestures "outraging her modesty" during a television debate. 

 "We had summoned him thrice but he did not turn up," a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters said. 
 
 When contacted, Supriyo told TOI, "I know nothing about it. Let them do whatever they want to do. I have nothing to say about it." 
 
  Along with filing the chargesheet on Wednesday, the police officers also submitted footage from the TV programme in which the remarks were allegedly made by Supriyo. 
 
 "The court may issue a warrant against him," said an officer. BJP state president   said, "We will fight this out in the streets and courts of law."
