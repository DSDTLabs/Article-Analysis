Hugs and kisses are known to seal relationships. However, in the case of TV actors Neeraj Malviya and Charu Asopa, it turned out to be the final nail in the coffin. The fact that the two had hit a rough patch in their relationship became evident when they called off their engagement last November. While Neeraj had confirmed the break-up back then, Charu was still hopeful of a reconciliation. However, the ‘hug-kiss’ drama that unfolded during the ongoing cricket reality show, has finally made her give up hope.

 A source said, “On the reality show, Neeraj and Charu belong to rival teams. Trouble started when Neeraj was not able to bowl well and Charu, who was seated among the audience, started cheering for her team. Later, when she taunted him, saying that he was not able to perform well because he didn’t have his lucky charm (her) by his side, Neeraj responded with a hug and a kiss. He, later, dismissed it as a friendly gesture.”
 
 When BT contacted Charu, the actress said, “I was shocked and shaken when Neeraj hugged and kissed me. I confronted him about the gesture after the game and asked him if it meant that we could get back together. However, he rudely replied, ‘Do not conclude anything on the basis of this’. I thought that the show has helped me reunite with my lost love, but now, I am sure that there is no future to our relationship. Some actors can go to any extent for publicity. Neeraj hugged and kissed me in public to get footage. It was just a publicity stunt. My parents are looking for a guy for me and I am okay with it. I am also focusing on my work.” 
 
 Neeraj, on the other hand, feels there is nothing to comment on the relationship. He said, “I hugged her, but that’s all. There are many differences to be sorted if our relationship has to be rekindled. As of now, there is nothing to comment on our relationship.”
