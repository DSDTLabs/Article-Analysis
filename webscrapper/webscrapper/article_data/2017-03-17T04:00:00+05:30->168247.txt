Vadodara: Special operations group (SOG) seized liquor stock worth Rs1.88 lakh on Thursday and arrested one person. Police said they had received a tip-off that a big stock of liquor had been brought to the city and kept in Sardar Market. “We reached the spot and found that liquor stock was being loaded from a tempo into a car. We arrested Kadar Sindhi, who was present at the spot and seized all the stock,” said SOG police inspector H M Vyas. 

 Dashrath Kahar, who is prime accused, is yet to be nabbed by the cops. Cops have seized 755 bottles of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) worth Rs1.88 lakh from the spot apart from the tempo and the car. Kahar had modified the tempo in a manner that it could carry boxes of liquor without anyone noticing it. He had made a secret chamber below the tempo and covered it with an iron plate. “We have registered a case at Navapura police station. Sindhi has been arrested several times in the past and also detained under Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA),” Vyas added.
