CHENNAI: Three days after the death of a 22-year-old burglary suspect under police custody, Chennai city police commissioner A K Vishwanathan on Tuesday transferred four police officers stationed at   police station.

 
 The victim — V   of Ezhil Nagar in Perumbakkam — was picked up on Thursday night regarding a house break-in incident along with his friend. They were taken to   police station. Though his friend was released,   was detained. Based on Anthony’s confession, police decided to recover the gold jewellery he had stolen and hidden in different places. Since he told them that some of the items were hidden inside a house at Kannagi Nagar, they took him there. On the way, Anthony is said to have developed health complications and was rushed to a private hospital where doctors referred him to Government Royapettah Hospital. There he was declared brought dead.
 
 Police records show that there were at least eight other cases, including robbery and house breakins, pending against Anthony in Neelankarai, Thoraipakkam and Pazhavanthangal. Following this, Neelangarai inspector  , sub inspector Raj Kumar, head constables   and Akilan have been transferred and placed in vacancy reserve.
