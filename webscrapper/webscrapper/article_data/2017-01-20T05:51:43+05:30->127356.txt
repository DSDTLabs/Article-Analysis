MUMBAI: An accused in the  , retired major   was on Wednesday granted permission by a special NIA court to contest the upcoming UP state elections.Special public prosecutor   confirmed the development and said the accused had now filed a plea seeking provisional bail from February 4 to March 4 to canvass for his seat.

 “We will submit our reply next week, following which the court will pronounce the order,“ Rasal said.
 
 Upadhyay filed the plea last week seeking the court's permission to contest the elections on a seat from Bairia.

The plea was however, rejected.
