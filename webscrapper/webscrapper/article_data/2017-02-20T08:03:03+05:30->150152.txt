LUCKNOW: As always,   was among the first to reach his polling station in Sadar bazar area of Lucknow Cantonment. But he could not vote as he was bitten by a stray dog. He was rushed to the Civil Hospital and given an anti-rabies vaccine. The doctor advised him rest but around lunch, he woke up and told his sons to take him for voting again. "Baba insisted and refused to eat till he had voted," said his daughter-in-law Shanti Devi. 

 Giving a reason, Bhavani said, "I wont be alive for the next elections." The man, who worked as a household cook and pulled a rickshaw to earn his living, is 107 years old. Barely able to hear anything, Bhavani said no vote should go waste. One of his granddaughters, enrolled in a nurse training institute and a first-time voter said she was inspired by him.
 
 Meanwhile, escorted by locals, as they entered the Prathmik Vidyalaya at Sarojininagar all those in the queue made way. These voters were all 100 years old and were garlanded by the polling booth officers in welcome. Locals said the anecdotes of their being the oldest and most honest voters were legend in the Kalli Pash Chim. A farmer, 102-year-old Chedilal, and his 100-year-old wife moved slowly to the polling booth. Sharing their experience, Chedilal said, " Dhundhla deekhat hai magar aawa hain...adhikar hai (Can't see properly but I had come to cast my vote as it is our right). 
 
 Age could not keep 99-year-old Nafees Jahan from casting her vote. She denied having missed voting ever in her life. The age-borne infirmities have made it difficult for her to hear and speak, and all she could manage to say, when asked what made her vote, was "Mulayam". She uses a walker at home and cannot go anywhere alone.
