AHMEDABAD: The   on Monday told   that the   will be applicable to all   from the   only.

 In response to the state government’s request seeking more clarification on its interim order, the apex court replied that private schools are required to send proposals for fee structure for the academic year 2017-18 as well as for 2018-19. The government had submitted that school managements are under the impression that they were supposed to send proposal for fee structure for the next academic year, though the fee regulation law was enacted in April 2017, said state’s government pleader Manisha Shah.
 
 The state government had confusion over reconstitution of fee fixation committees as well as revision authority. The SC clarified that each of these committees should be headed by either a retired high court judge or by a retired district court judge.
 
 For revision authority, the apex court said that it should form a full-fledged statutory committee comprising various experts. However, a retired HC judge will be its chairman and another retired HC judge should be appointed as its deputy chairman.
 
 In its interim order, the SC had told the state government that the schools will sent their proposals only after fixation of exemption limits, which are at present Rs 15,000, Rs 25,000 and Rs 27,000 for primary, secondary and higher secondary sections. The SC has permitted all stakeholders to seek a revision in these slabs as school management insisted that the government should increase the limits.
 
 The court had also said that the fee regulation committees would take decision on proposals sent by the schools on their fee structures in four weeks.
 
 In its earlier order, the apex court had in detail fixed deadlines for the processes at each of these stages.
 
 Further hearing on this issue has been posted in May, and the SC has made it clear that all fee amounts should till then be treated as provisional only.
