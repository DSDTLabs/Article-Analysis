GUWAHATI: Even as the dust settles on the  , which propelled a   to power, the   here plunged into a crisis. 

 One of the allies,   (AGP), took to the streets on Thursday in protest against the government's failure to arrest  , the mastermind behind the Silapathar vandalism.
 
 Biswas, president of a pro-immigrants group, has been accused of instigating workers to vandalize an office of the powerful All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) at Silapathar on March 6.
 
 "Ten days have passed since the Silapathar incident but the state government has failed to nab the culprit. It has failed to provide safety to the people of Assam," AGP founder-president and former two-time CM Prafulla Kumar Mahanta told TOI. 
 
 Biswas is wanted by police and carries a price of Rs 1 lakh on his head. He has been slapped with charges of rioting, unlawful assembly, house trespassing, attempt to murder, mischief and promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth and language.
 
 Relations between AGP and BJP have been strained ever since chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal allocated posts of chairmen and directors of key state PSUs to BJP leaders but this is the first time AGP has so vocally criticized its ally in Assam.
 
 "We will always raise our voice for the cause of regionalism. We may be a part of the government but our priority is protecting local interests," Mahanta added.
