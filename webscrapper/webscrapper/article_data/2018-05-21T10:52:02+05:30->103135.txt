BATHINDA: Going by the black colour of Sirhind feeder canal water, which passes through Muktsar district,   Sumeet Jarangal has asked the people not to use the canal water for drinking purposes. The DC has also directed the public health and water supply sanitation department not to lift water for water works till it is completely cleaned. The water from the water works is used for drinking purposes. 

 Samples are being collected from the canal to check its quality as the water was stinking when it reached the Sirhind feeder on Saturday after passing through Harike headworks. Due to molasses seeping from a sugar mill at Kiri Afghana village in Gurdaspur into the Beas thousands of fish had died. The oxygen level has also decreased in the water, which was noticed on Sunday in Sirhind feeder. The water in the Rajasthan feeder, which runs parallel to Sirhind feeder too is blackish in colour and the state irrigation authorities have alerted the Rajasthan irrigation department about molasses in canal water. 
 
 The district administration has also alerted the block development and panchayat officers (BDPOs) to apprise people about the quality of canal water. The irrigation department has been directed to pull out fish or other water animals out of the canal if these are spotted. 
 
  on Sunday said that “as water is black in Sirhind feeder canal, the department of water supply and sanitation has been directed to regularly collect samples to check the quality. The department has also been directed not to lift water from Sirhind feeder into water works, which further supplies water to people for drinking purposes. The water quality is expected to get cleaner by Monday evening”. He, however, said that the canal water could be used for irrigation purposes. 
 
 Punjab pollution control board chairman Kahan Singh Pannu said the board was keeping a vigil and strictly monitoring flow of industrial waste into the canals.
