Anand: A proposal has been mooted to relax the chest measurement rules for candidates appearing in the recruitment rallies as the criterion has been a major stumbling block for the aspirants.

 “An average 25 % candidates fail in the chest measurement test. The proposal to relax the test has been forwarded to the Ministry of Defence which will take the final call,” said an army official, adding that as per the present army recruitment rules, the candidate’s chest measurement should not be less than 77 cm with minimum range of expansion of 5 cm. 
 
 “Even if there is a relaxation, it will be in the range of 1 or 2 cm. If cleared, it will be introduced from the next rally,” said the official. 
 
 Another major reason for Gujarati youths not matching the criterion of army physical test is the habit of chewing tobacco. “Because of tobacco chewing, stamina level of youngsters goes drastically down and they could not meet the physical tests related to running the distance in stipulated time,” he said.tnn
