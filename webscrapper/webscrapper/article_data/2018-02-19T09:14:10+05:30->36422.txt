KOCHI: Over 10,000 people visited the tourism fest ' ' over the past three days in Kochi. The fest, which wrapped up on Sunday evening, had an array of events and competitions for the participants, including a ride in a Ferrari and staycation packages to Abu Dhabi. 

 "The event in Kochi, which was held as part of the second edition of the 'Abu Dhabi Week' (a 'Visit Abu Dhabi' initiative) saw a surprisingly large number of visitors. Compared to other cities, Kochi had an unexpected turnout," said the event's spokesperson. The first edition was held in Delhi and Mumbai in 2017.
 
 The last day saw live cooking by authentic Emirati chefs and dance and music performances, including Harbiya dance by artistes from Abu Dhabi, which proved to be major crowd-pullers.
 
 "Compared to other cities in India, the event's task was already half-complete even before we began considering the decades-old connection between Kerala and Abu Dhabi. The target was to more or less focus on developing an urge in visitors to visit Abu Dhabi, than creating awareness about the emirate," said Bejan Dinshaw, country manager of India, Abu Dhabi Department of culture and tourism.
 
 Abu Dhabi had welcomed 3,20,000 Indian hotel guests last year with a year-on-year increase of 11%. Etihad Airways and Jet Airways operate 282 flights a week, from 13 Indian destinations.
