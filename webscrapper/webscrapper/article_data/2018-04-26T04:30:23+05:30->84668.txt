NEW DELHI:   took a pot shot at PM  , tweeting from its handle @INCIndia, a video of   – then the chief minister of Gujarat – with Asaram. What followed was a twitter war, with   supporters immediately tweeting pictures of Congress leader like Digvijaya Singh, Ashok Gehlot, Kamal Nath and   with Asaram.

 
 Congress had taken the high moral ground, captioning the Modi video with, “A man is known by the company he keeps”. The party followed its tweet with another one, which listed a bunch of BJP politicians purportedly making derogatory statements about women.
 
 The Congress tweet invited criticism from some eminent personalities, including film actor-director Farhan Akhtar, who said it wasn't a crime if someone was associated with Asaram before he was accused or found guilty.
 
 “So, Asaram is a child rapist. And he has been found guilty. Good. But can people please stop sharing images of him with PM Modi. Patronising him before he was exposed to be a pervert is no crime. Let's be fair and give him the benefit of doubt that he, like us, did not know,” tweeted Akhtar.
 
 There were some embarrassing moments for International Cricket Council (ICC) after its official twitter handle shared a video of Modi and Asaram with the caption “Narayan Narayan”. The tweet was deleted in a few minutes but many users took screenshots and lashed out at the ICC.
 
 Later, ICC apologised through a tweet: “ICC is dismayed at a non-cricket related tweet appearing on its Twitter feed earlier today. We would like to extend our sincere apologies to anyone who was offended during the short space of time it was up. We have launched an investigation into how this happened.”
 
 “This is unfortunate that an objectionable post has been attributed to the ICC official social media account. Not done. We did bring up the matter to the ICC's notice,” PTI reported, quoting a top BCCI official.
