SECUNDERABAD: The Local Military Authority ( ) on Tuesday reopened all the roads, which were closed, in the military area in  .

 
 After a gap of four years, the roads are now accessible to citizens. LMA has acted on the decision taken by the   to open all the closed roads in 62 cantonments across the country. Though the announcement was made on Sunday, the LMA, which was waiting for formal orders, reopened the roads on Tuesday.
 
  
 The roads were closed without following the procedure laid down in the Cantonments Act 2006. “The LMA on receipt of written instructions lifted restrictions on all roads,” said an official press release. However, the LMA did not release the list of roads on which restrictions have been lifted.   men posted at entrance of the shut roads were withdrawn after they were opened.
 
 The LMA spent about ?70 lakh on setting up barricades and gates to permanently close all roads. But the MoD’s announcement has come as a major relief to thousands of people, who pass these roads.
 
 “The opening of roads should be done on need basis. People should not see it as their victory. They should cooperate with the military authorities keeping in view the nation’s security,” said Major (retired) Shiva Kiran.
 
 Secunderabad Cantomment Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on Tuesday celebrated the opening of the closed roads. They performed ‘Palaabhishekam’ to the portrait of Union Defence Minister   at the AOC circle. Army officials videographed the celebrations.
 
 Commuters welcomed the reopening of the roads. As the MoD said closure of roads will be taken up afresh based on the requirement after following rules, it is unlikely that all the roads reopened on Tuesday would remain open on permanent basis. Some roads may be closed later citing security or other reasons, sources said.
