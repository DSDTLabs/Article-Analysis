PORVORIM: Just days after Prime Minister   and   national president Amit Shah promised farmers in Karnataka that the Mhadei water sharing dispute could be resolved through an amicable solution, Goa agriculture minister Vijai   rubbished the notion and said that Goa would not compromise on the issue.

 Sardesai, whose party,   (GFP), is part of the NDA, also seemed to suggest that the statements made by   and Shah were as part of the ongoing election campaign for the Karnataka assembly polls. 
 
 “The interest of the state of Goa vis-a-vis Mhadei will never be compromised on by this government,” Sardesai told mediapersons on Monday.
 
 On Friday, Modi assured farmers in   that the BJP would resolve the Mhadei water dispute if the BJP came to power in Karnataka. Shah followed it up on Sunday by setting a six-month deadline for a solution to the issue.
 
 Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka are locked in a legal battle before the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal. Goa has objected to the Kalasa-Banduri project which seeks to divert water from the Mhadei basin to Belagavi, Dharwad and Gadag.
