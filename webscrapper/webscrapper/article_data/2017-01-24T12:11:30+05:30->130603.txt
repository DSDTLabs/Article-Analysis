INDORE: Although the   organised in the city turned out to be a huge hit,   feel that such competitions can make wrestlers earn money but not help them win Olympic medal. 

 "Though the movie Dangal has brought back the wrestling mania but such traditional dangals that do not follow international rules will not be helpful for the budding wrestlers who aim to win medals at international level," said Indore's Kripa Shankar Bishnoi, the muscle man behind Aamir Khan's kushti in Dangal.
 
 "Such competitions will surely give the wrestlers some financial help for a good diet but if we look at the technical aspects such events might mislead youngsters. It's important that this traditional sport is modified as per international standards like Indian style wrestling association does," he added.
 
 His niece Arpana Bishnoi, who is also a Commonwealth silver medallist said that she began practising in mud but with time she changed her techniques and started wrestling on the mat. Meanwhile, some experts felt that such a huge response is good for promoting sports in the city and even for local wrestlers.
 
 "Though I was not in town to see this dangal, I heard a lot of praise about the event. Such dangal will help the wrestlers financially and will help them to get a better diet for a better preparation. This is for the first time I have seen such a huge response from the locals in Indore," said Ved Prakash, coach of SAI wrestling centre in the city.
 
 Even the much popular wrestler from the city Rohit Patel, who won a fantastic battle against Yudhveer Pehalwan on Sunday said that the organising of such dangals will inspire budding wrestlers to take up the sport professionally.
