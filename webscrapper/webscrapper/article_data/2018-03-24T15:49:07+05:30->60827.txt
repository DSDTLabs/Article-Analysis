GUWAHATI: A class V student was   and   by a 21-year-old youth and two juveniles in central  's Nagaon district on Friday. The girl, who was battling for life in hospital with 90% burn injuries, died on late Friday night. Cops have apprehended the accused minors, aged 11 and 10, while the third culprit is absconding. 
 
 
 "The minors have admitted to the crime. During questioning, they said the girl was alone at home after returning from school when the youth   raped her. The juveniles then joined in and the three of them later set her on fire," police said, adding that the victim's parents were at work when the crime took place.
 
 A possible personal enmity of the family with Zakir may have triggered the crime, it is believed.
 
 This is the second case in the district since last Thursday, when a 35-year-old woman was gang-raped by eight men in front of her husband. The culprits had waylaid the couple on the pretext of offering shelter for the night after they were stranded in Chaparmukh area due to unavailability of transport.
 
 During the state budget session last month, parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary informed the house that at least 3009 rapes and 106 cases of violence against women were registered in Assam after the Sarbananda Sonowal government came into force in 2016.
