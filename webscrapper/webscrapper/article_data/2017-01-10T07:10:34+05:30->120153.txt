MUMBAI: Markets regulator   wants the   ( ) to fix responsibility for the systems breach on its trading servers that had happened for 18 months starting December 2012. Sebi wants the bourse to name those who were responsible for this breach that led to substantial illegal profits for a select few brokers. 

 The regulator also wants NSE to disgorge all the ill-gotten profits of those brokers and take appropriate remedial actions, sources said.
 
 In its IPO prospectus filed last week, NSE disclosed that a system audit by a consulting firm ( ) had found that its trading system was compromised that had allowed certain brokers to get preferential treatment over all others.
 
 It also found that some of the bourse’s employees had helped these brokers gain such preferential access to NSE’s trading system. After initial reluctance by the bourse, the audit was conducted on orders from Sebi.
 
 On December 23, NSE had sent the audit report to the regulator.
 
 “We are not satisfied with the response given by NSE. We are going to ask them to fix responsibility for the breach of system,” said a regulatory official.
