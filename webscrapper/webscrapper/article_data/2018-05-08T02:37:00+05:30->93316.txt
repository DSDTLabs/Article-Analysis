Vijayawada: P Ashok Babu, president of Andhra Pradesh Non-Gazetted Officers Association, on Monday justified his campaigning against the Bharatiya Janata Party in Karnataka which is headed for its assembly elections on May 12. He is currently touring Karnataka campaigning against the BJP among the Telugu-speaking people in the state. This has antagonised several BJP leaders, who have taken a strong exception to the presence of an NGO leader, who is also a state government employee, in the election campaign. They have threatened to take up the issue with the Election Commission and the Centre.

 Responding to the objections, Ashok Babu said that he had led the Samaikyandhra movement in Andhra Pradesh in the past and hence has the right to campaign in the elections. “The Samaikyandhra movement was a big success and the central government had to promise special category status to the AP following the agitation. Now, the same special category status has been denied by the central government led by the BJP. Thus, I have the right to campaign against the BJP, which has done AP injustice,” Ashok Babu said.
 
 Ashok Babu along with representatives from various organisations from Karnataka are currently telling the electorates how the BJP has done injustice to AP by going back on its promises and refusing to fulfil the benefits that were promised to AP, and hence they must not vote for the BJP.
 
 Meanwhile, in Amaravati, TDP MLC and AP SC Finance Corporation chairman Jupudi Prabhakara Rao, backed Ashok Babu saying, “Ashok Babu is first a citizen of AP and later an employee. He has the right to express his views on politics as a voter and a citizen,” Prabhakar asserted.
