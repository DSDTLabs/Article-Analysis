BHOPAL:   on Saturday sought the resignation of chief minister   a day after the   tabled in the assembly claimed that the government had “denied access of Vyapam records” to the CAG in 2015 and 2016.

 “The questions raised by CAG in its report made it clear as to who has been patronising and protecting corruption and big scams in the state,” said Yadav. “With the CAG report underlining irregularities in Vyapam, corruption in nutritious meals scheme and MNREGA, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should resign forthwith,” added the state Congress chief. The Congress said the image of Madhya Pradesh has been hit badly because of the Vyapam scam. “This CAG report has corroborated what the Congress has been highlighting about Vyapam, on the streets and in the state assembly,” he argued. State Congress leaders told TOI that the party will make the CAG report a major electoral issue in the upcoming bypolls in Ater and Bandhavgarh assembly seats.
 
 Taking a dig at the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue, Yadav said, “Why is the BJP’s top leadership, which always stalled functioning of parliament over alleged corruption during UPA regime, tight-lipped now? The same leaders who disrupted parliament during the UPA rule are ministers in the Union government today. Have they nothing to say on the corruption in Madhya Pradesh? Modi promised the nation, “Naa khaunga naa khane dunga (will neither be corrupt nor permit corruption)”. How should the state view his silence on the issue of tainted government here?”
 
 Sources in the state party headquarters said a technical team has been given the CAG report to strategize how the Congress can take the observations to the people. “After going through the report there will be media briefings, agitations and political rallies to bring the issue to the centre-stage,” said state chief Congress spokesman KK Mishra.
