PANAJI: With the tourist season for shack operations ending on Thursday, the tourism department has directed shack allottees to dismantle the structures and dispose the material without causing any damage to the environment.

 In a circular, the department has asked the allottees to submit compliance reports by June 10. They have been directed to submit another report by June 20 detailing how they disposed of the material used for setting up their  .
 
 The circular pointed that some allottees while dismantling their shacks, were burning the material on the beaches or burying it in the sand in total disregard to the environment and cause destruction of the beaches.
 
 The circular states that in case any shack allottee is found to have disposed of material in a way that it could be an environmental hazard, the allotment of the shack to such defaulter would be cancelled for the next season, besides being liable for prosecution.
 
 Every season, around 350 shacks are allotted along the various beach stretches of the state. Majority shacks are allotted along the North Goa coast line of Calangute, Candolim and Baga.
 
 Most of the operators dismantle their shacks by the end of April or by mid-May as the season draws to a close, but those in Calangute, Candolim and Baga continue till May-end, making most of the domestic crowd. The validity of a shack permit is for three years, but the structure must be removed by May 31. The permission to re-erect is issued in September, when the tourist season commences.
