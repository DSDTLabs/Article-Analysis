PUNE: Three years after submitting a proposal to start an electronics cluster for the defence industry in and around Pune, city-based   (DEMA) is still awaiting the required permission from the Union government.

 The association requires about 24-acre land to set up the cluster. It had submitted its proposal in this regard to the   (MIDC) in 2013. However, there has been no substantial progress on it.
 
 DEMA president Shirish Deshmukh told TOI, “We had identified land in Hinjewadi and had chalked out a detailed proposal of the cluster. Although, the MIDC authorities agreed to give us land, they have told us to get permission from the ministry of electronics and information technology. We applied to the ministry for the permit, but we are yet to get it.”
 
 According to DEMA, despite following up the matter with the ministry, the required permission has not been granted so far.
 
 DEMA is an association of more than 50 engineering industries, including small and medium enterprises, in and around Pune. The members are mainly engaged in providing engineering products and services to the research department of the ministry of defence.
 
 DEMA believes this cluster will lead to faster development of new equipment and will also expose Indian manufacturers to new technology.
 
 “Dedicated clusters like those in Bangalore and Chennai have the potential to play a pivotal role for the defence establishments in the city.” Deshmukh said.
 
 A senior official from the MIDC told TOI, “We had given in-principle consent to the DEMA in the past. As per the rules, the association should get the requisite permission from the ministry, which they have not got. As a result, there is no progress on their proposal.”
 
 Uday Tembe, an owner of   firm and a member of DEMA, said, “Since the city has a large number of serving defence personnel and researchers, we can get to know their requirements and work on it accordingly.”
