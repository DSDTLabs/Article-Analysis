A new serial on   in medical sector is all set to hit television soon. The serial will be a 6 months long mega serial. 

 The show will focus on  , malpractices by medical institutions and the highly expensive health care system. However, the title of the serial and the lead cast are yet to be finalised.
 
 The director of the show   Basu said, “We wanted to highlight a social issue through our serial. Medical treatment in our society has become a very expensive affair. People from middle class and lower middle class background have to spend their last penny to get their loved ones cured. Yet the treatment we get is not up to the mark. We wanted to highlight this issue.”
 
 The story begins with a middle class family selling their house to save the life of a family member. Arindam said, “We will show hard hitting facts. There will be incidents like staff selling the medicines that are supposed to be distributed to the patients free of cost, keeping a dead patient under ventilatory support just to increase the bills.” The director informed that after an initial brainstorming session they decided to make a small promo and upload it on social media.
 
 The director of the channel Eshita Surana said, “We received a massive response from our viewers. They have shared their personal experience and we are writing the script based on these real life experiences. We will not show a make-believe story just for the sake of it.” Eshita promised that there won’t be any high voltage 'saas-bahu' drama on the serial. She further added, “Showing extramarital affairs, domestic abuse on a regular basis affects the society. We consciously wanted to explore a different genre. We are also planning a serial on surrogacy as well.”
