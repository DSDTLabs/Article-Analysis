BENGALURU: Suresh Kumar, Rajajinagar   and BJP candidate for the assembly segment, on Wednesday denied reports that his daughter,  , was taken into custody by police for allegedly distributing cash to voters in the constituency on Wednesday.

 Kumar’s clarification comes in the backdrop of the alleged seizure of Rs 99,000 by flying squad officials of the Election Commission, following a raid on a construction firm on 14th Main Road in Rajajinagar. Opposition parties had charged Kumar’s daughter with distributing cash and the report aired by television channels.
 
 
 However, Kumar said: “It is 100% fake news. My party, daughter and I do not believing in giving money to voters. We have never done it and will not do it. It is a conspiracy to malign me just before the assembly polls. My daughter, who is actively involved with the BJP’s social media cell, was interacting with the party’s team that had come from Delhi.”
 
 Police said there was tension in the area after the news of cash distribution spread, but the situation was under control.
