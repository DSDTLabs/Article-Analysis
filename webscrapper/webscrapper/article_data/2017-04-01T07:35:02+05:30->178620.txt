GURGAON: The All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) has   all its state and district-level units in   as it plans to set up an RSS-like organisation of the community across the country.

 The   has also decided to hold token sit-ins at just nine of the 15 places they were earlier being organised at. The nine spots include — Raswala Chowk in Jhajjar, Jasia in Rohtak, Lath Joli Chowk in Sonipat, Ikkas in Jind, Deban in Kaithal, Mayar in Hisar, Dhanana in Bhiwani, ugrakheri in   and Dhani Gopal in Fatehabad.
 
 AIJASS chief Yashpal Malik said, “Since the organization has no office in Haryana, the sit-in sites will double up as the committees offices and members would gather at these spots to meet, discuss and finish paper work.” The move comes following CM Manohar Lal Khattar’s assurances to the community to fulfil their demands.
