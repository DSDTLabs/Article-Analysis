THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP’s incredible victory in   is likely to have its impact in the upcoming byelection to the Chengannur assembly seat as the victory in the CPM’s bastion in the northeast is bound to invigorate the saffron party’s rank and file in  . 

 The constituency is heading for a byelection following the death of   MLA KK Ramachandran Nair in January. Former state   president PS Sreedharan Pillai polled 42,000 votes in the Chengannur seat in the last election. His tough challenge gave ablow to   as two-time MLA PC Vishnunath lost the turf to Nair. 
 
 Though Nair won by a margin of 7,983 votes, the total number of votes polled in his favour was less than what the LDF candidate had won in the previous election. “The Chengannur byelection is important to CPM, Congress and BJP, irrespective of CPM’s rout in Tripura. 
 
 Since it’s in the run-up to the 2019 elections, its impact would have far-reaching consequences in Kerala politics. One will not be surprised if   camps in the state or PM   addresses a rally,” said a senior BJP leader.
