VISAKHAPATNAM: Amidst all the turmoil at Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) due to the central government’s disinvestment move, the public sector unit has secured a Rs 88.5 crore project of dredging the channels and basins of   through competitive bidding.

 DCI has been carrying out the maintenance dredging works at the Cochin Port continuously since 2011-12. Cochin Port had invited global tenders for maintenance dredging for the year 2017-18 during August 2017 which is one of the major maintenance dredging projects in India.
 
 “DCI participated in the bidding process and stood as the lowest bidder with Rs 88.51 crore, thereby successfully retaining the work in its order book for next year,” a press release said on Thursday. 
 
 The dredging at Cochin Port is to be carried out throughout the year by deploying two dredgers.
 
 DCI is the only PSU in the dredging field in India and is securing all major contracts through open competitive bidding processes, a   official said.
 
 However, the dredging company based in  , is one among a few PSUs which were reportedly shortlisted by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) for a strategic sale.
 
 The employees of   are against the stated move by the government of India and have organised several forms of protests which found support from various political parties like YSRCP, Jana Sena.
 
 “DCIL is not in losses and it has been bagging work orders by participating in the tender processes along with other players. The move to privatise a PSU which is working for development of the nation is totally deplorable,” Narsinga Rao, general secretary, Non-Executive Employees Union of the DCIL tells TOI.
