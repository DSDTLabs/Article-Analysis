Chandigarh: Taking cognizance of the matter related to the death of an infant, who had fallen into an open manhole in Hisar, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued notice to the Haryana government. The allegations are that a 13-month-old infant had died due to the negligence of the Hisar Municipal Corporation (HMC). The state government and local administration of Hisar have been asked to respond to the issue by July 2. 

 A division bench headed by Justice A K Mittal passed these orders after receiving a note from Justice Daya Chaudhary, who is inspecting judge of the Hisar sessions division, and had received a letter from Gangaputra Rajesh Hindustani, a resident of Hisar. 
 
 In his letter to Justice Chaudhary, Rajesh stated that 13-month old son of a labourer was missing and his body was recovered from a manhole, which was not covered. The incident had taken place on March 13. 
 
 Accusing the HMC for the negligence, the letter addressed to Justice Chaudhary, had stated that the family lost its child and there was no hope for help from the authorities. It was also added that despite a complaint given to the police, no action has been taken in the matter. 
 
 On receiving letter, Justice Chaudhary treated it as public interest litigation and referred it to the chief justice for appropriate action.
