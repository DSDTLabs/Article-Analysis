MUMBAI: A 26-year-old “godman” charged with the   of a 20-year-old   from Palghar filed a   petition in the Bombay high court claiming that the young woman was his wife and that she had been kept in confinement by her father. Trimbakmuni Mangalmuni Das’s gambit backfired on Friday when the prosecution produced the woman before a division bench of Justice Ranjit More and Justice Sarang Kotwal. The woman denied that she was married to Das, saying instead that he had “influenced” her and taken her away.

 She said she wanted to live with her parents. With the bench not inclined to grant relief, Das withdrew the petition. 
 
 In his petition, Das said that he was a holy man living in Sitamai Math at Jawhar in Palghar. He said the woman’s father was among his followers and had approached him as she was suffering from piles. The complaint said Das promised to cure her and she regularly visited the math. The woman’s father lodged a complaint at the Mokhada police station after she went missing on April 15. 
 
 The police traced the woman, who had been taken to Bhilad in Gujarat, and reunited her with her family. On April 29, Das’s advocate sent a notice saying Das and the woman had married and sought restitution of conjugal rights. On May 4, the woman lodged an FIR accusing Das of kidnapping her, taking her to his home in Gujarat, and forcibly marrying and sexually assaulting her. The police charged Das with kidnap and rape under the IPC besides the relevant sections of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act.
 
 In the habeas corpus petition last month, Das urged the high court to order the police to produce his “wife”. The petition said he and the woman were in love and the rape charge was filed after they married. It included a marriage certificate copy. His lawyers sought the quashing of the FIR. Additional public prosecutor Aruna Pai, opposed it.
