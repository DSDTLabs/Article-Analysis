RAIPUR: The two-day long   will kick off at Sirpur town in Mahsamund district on February 10. 

 Earlier for few years, Sirpur Mahotsav was organised as national dance and music festival of Chhattisgarh. Renowned dance and music exponents and many dignitaries from Buddhist countries attended the fest. However, the festival was scaled down. Mahasamund district administration will organise a two-day fest this year with local flavour of traditional dance and music.
 
 Mahsamund deputy collector Omkar Yadu told TOI, "This is the third year that the district administration is organising the fest with the help of local artistes. This year also, dance and musical groups from across the state will come to Sirpur to perform at the two-day extravaganza. The fest will draw to a close on February 11."
 
 "Sirpur is well known for its archaeological monuments and ancient temples. To promote its heritage,   (CTB) had started the national-level dance and musical festival. Famous Sufi singers Shubha Mudgal, Teejan Bai and   had performed at the fest but due to some reasons, it was discontinued," veteran archaeologist   told TOI.
 
 Sirpur Festival provided a big opportunity to the artistes of Chhattisgarh to share one platform with the national and international-level artistes of the country and similarly, it will also give a peek into the history of Sirpur village which is famous for its archaeological excavations and Laxman temple - one of the finest brick temples of India."
