NEW DELHI: It’s close to midnight. You are woken from your slumber by what appear to be gunshots. Only, they are anything but that.   with   that make crackling sounds similar to gunshots have become quite common in the city. 

 
  
 
 Though the government has now planned a crackdown, the demand for these sound monsters is on the rise. Sold as  , they are available for anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,000. Some of them are manufactured in factories in UP and Haryana and while they look like branded ones, they make much louder noise. Their prices differ according to the type of metal used to manufacture the outer cast. 
 
 TOI visited some shops in Karol Bagh that sell modified silencer pipes and other items like pressure horns, which are illegal but in high demand. “Most customers go for designer silencers. We warn them about the loud noise they make, but these are the “in” thing among the youth,” Tinku Singh, an employee with a popular bike-accessory shop, said. The engine emits a crackling sound every time the biker accelerates.
 
 A locally made silencer pipe can be bought for as low as Rs 1,000. “A modified silencer pipe does not have a filter to stop excessive noise. In the long run, it damages the engine, but bikers are fine with that,” a shop owner said. “Someone riding a heavy bike wants to feel the thump of the engine. This is where modified silencers come in. Company-made products, which serve the same purpose and keep decibel levels in check, are also available. But the local ones are cheaper, there is a huge demand for them,” he said.
 
 Joint commissioner (traffic) Garima Bhatnagar said the crackdown on modified bikes had been going on for several years. “The riders are booked for violation of registration certificate regulations and fined accordingly,” Bhatnagar said. According to experts, the sound from a pressure horn or a modified silencer is more than double the permissible limit and can damage eardrums.
