Ponda: A fortnight after a highly decomposed body with the face smashed beyond recognition was recovered from  , Ponda police, on Monday, have made an arrest in the case.

 Ponda DySP Sunita Sawant said the accused, Ningappa ‘Muthu’ Hirahal, 27, a native of Bagalkot, Karnataka, has confessed to the crime and has revealed that the deceased, identified as Sangappa ‘Sanmesh’ Patil, 30, was in an illicit relationship with his wife.
 
 On April 28, Patil’s body was found at ‘devchar kond’, on the bank of River Dudhsagar, in Collem. At the time police had no leads as there was nothing on the body to identify it by. However, the Collem railway CCTV footage gave the police a lead. 
 
 “Both were working on mining trucks at Sanvordem Tisk and were friends. As a friend, the victim used to visit the accused’s house, which is how the illicit relationship between the accused’s wife and the victim developed,” Sawant said.
 
 Police sources said that on April 21, Hirahal took Patil to Dudhsagar where they got drunk. When Patil was relaxing under the influence of alcohol, the accused killed him by smashing his head with two stones.
 
 After committing the crime, the accused returned to his rented room and took his wife to Karnataka, left her at her mother’s house there, and proceeded to Kankavli, Maharashtra on the pretext that Goa has a mining problem. There he took up a job as a truck driver.
 
 Police picked Hirahal up from Karnataka. A case of murder under IPC Section 302 has been registered against him at the Collem police station. Collem PI Nilesh Dhaigodkar is the investigation officer in the case.
