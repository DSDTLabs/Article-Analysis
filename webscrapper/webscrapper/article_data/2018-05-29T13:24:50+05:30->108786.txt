VADODARA: Melted gold weighing around 2.7 kilogram was stolen from a goldsmith’s shop at Shamadbechar ni Pol near   in the wee hours of May 25. Complainant   approached City police station with her complaint late on Sunday alleging that her business partner and family member   and his brother-in-law   had stolen the gold which was worth Rs 55 lakh.

 
 
 The duo was arrested by the police on Monday afternoon, but the gold was not recovered from them.
 
 Police said that when Rani’s employee Hari opened the shop on May 25 morning, he learnt that a large part of melted gold from a drum kept on the third floor of the shop was missing. When the complainant went to check, she found that only 500 gram of gold was left out in the drum. According to police, nobody had broken into Rani’s shop through the main door therefore she suspected that somebody stole the gold through the window which opens into the terrace of neighbouring building. The neighbouring building is owned by Gadge.
 
 On checking the neighbouring building’s terrace, several marks of liquid were found on the floor and walls of the terrace. Rani then also checked the footages of   camera installed outside her shop. A police official said that Jitendra and Gadge were seen moving around the shop between 11 pm on previous day and 2 am on May 25 in the footages.
 
 When a security guard of nearby ATM was asked, he informed that he had seen Jitendra and Gadge walking with carboys on that night. Rani then informed the police about the incident and a case was registered late on Sunday.
 
 In her statement, Rani told the police that Jitendra has to pay Rs three lakh and to avoid that he must have stolen the gold.
