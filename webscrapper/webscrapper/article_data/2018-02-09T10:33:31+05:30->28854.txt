PANAJI: The electricity department will be replacing three lakh analog electricity meters in the state with digital meters. Power minister Pandurang   said there are around 60,000 faulty meters, which if replaced, will help the department plug a part of its revenue gap. 

 “As a result of the faulty meters, we couldn’t bill consumers according to their (power) consumption. We have already tendered them (digital meters). Work will begin from next month,” Madkaikar told TOI. 
 
 The department has also set up an enforcement wing that has already begun a drive to identify those involved in power theft. A number of households renting out rooms and flats indulge in power theft by paying for domestic power rates offered by the government and using the power for commercial purposes, he said, adding that a separate cell under the enforcement wing of the department has been entrusted with internal audits of the infrastructure.
 
 The power minister also said the proposed 5% tariff hike will be effective only from April once approved by the   ( ). 
 
 A part of the department’s revenue deficit has to be recovered through a tariff hike, he said, explaining that the JERC is pushing for the department to stop depending on the government for budgetary support. The department, in its petition to JERC, has proposed that Rs 394 crore of the Rs 473 revenue gap be met through budgetary support, and Rs 73 crore through a tariff hike.
 
 “Goa is the only state that gived such a big subsidy for power. Power is much cheaper here compared to other states. Sometimes we buy at Rs 8 per unit and charge a maximum of only Rs 3.25 per unit,” Madkaikar said.
