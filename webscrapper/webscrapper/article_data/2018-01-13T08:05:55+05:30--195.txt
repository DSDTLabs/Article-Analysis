HYDERABAD: To bring changes in the law to criminalise the 'end client' ( ) in cases of sexual trafficking, the Andhra Pradesh government on Friday issued a GO spelling out its intent and formed an advisory group to make recommendations as part of the legal reforms. 

 "The sex buyer, who generates the demand and is at the core of the problem of sex trafficking, often escapes the law," a GO issued by the department of women and child welfare department said on Friday.
 
 "AP becomes the first state to explore the option of criminalizing demand for flesh trade," said anti-trafficking activist  , who will be on the seven-member advisory group. She also appreciated Andhra Pradesh chief minister   for "thinking bold" and standing up for the safety of women and children. 
 
 As of now, women caught in prostitution are treated as victims and sent to rehabilitation homes. The organisers of the prostitution racket are booked under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, with rigorous imprisonment of one year and a Rs 2,000 fine for a first time offence. If convicted a second time, the punishment is two years extending up to five years with a fine of Rs 2,000.
 
 The AP government had formed a state-level coordination committee with the chief secretary as chairman to meet once every three months to review the situation on trafficking and implementation of measures for rescue, rehabilitation and mainstreaming of victims.
 
 As the panel felt the need for a relook at the legislative provisions to punish the 'sex buyer' and that appropriate amendments to the law would be needed, the advisory group was formed. Apart from  , it will include a member-nominee of the chief justice, a Nalsar professor, a woman IPS officer to be designated by the home secretary, senior advocate M   and special secretary of the women and child welfare department as convenor.
