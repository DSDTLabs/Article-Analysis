 Senior inspector Rekha   told TOI that though the primary complaint states that the victim was duped of Rs 30 lakh, but within a day, many people have come forward with their complaints against the suspect. “The figure has now reached over Rs 1.50 crore,” Salunkhe added.
 
 The suspect is a resident of an upscale society in Erandwane. Her husband is a well-known lawyer in the city.

The victims told the police that they do not even know in which companies the suspect had invested their money.
 
 The police suspect that the woman may have duped many more unsuspecting people.
