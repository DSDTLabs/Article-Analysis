As part of the tradition followed every year, the celebrations for the Marathi New Year started early morning today with pomp and fervour with shobha yatras across the city. Girgaon, Dadar, Thane, Dombivali are the most prominent places which have the colourful rallies apart from various other regions in Mumbai which see the annual parade.
 
  
 The festival which celebrates the New year is high on community spirit and people from all age groups were seen coming together to join the long parade. The streets were a riot of colour as traditionally attired men and women waving flags, playing the traditional   and tashas, doing the lezim dance on the streets matched steps and moved forward along in synchronisation. 
 
  
  
 Rangolis were made on the road even as the procession marched ahead. They indeed made for a wonderful sight. Apart from people dressed in prominent Maharashtrian personalities, it was the   who rode bikes wearing the traditional Navwari sarees and jewellery who were the main attraction.
  
  
 The hot sun didnâ€™t deter the participants who were seen dancing enthusiastically to the beat of the traditional drums and music. At regular intervals one could see volunteers distributing food packets and water to keep the enthusiasm going.
