CHANDIGARH: Gidderbaha MLA Amarinder Singh Raja   on Friday made way for   leader from Uttar Pradesh Keshav Chander   as the new Indian Youth Congress (IYC) president.

 An announcement made by Congress general secretary Ashok Gehlot said, “The party appreciates the work done by Amarinder Singh Raja, who is stepping down from his responsibility as the national president of Indian Youth Congress.” Yadav was so far the national general secretary of IYC and in charge of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. 
 
 Warring was a part of the panel that interviewed his probable successors. The MLA was picked as the IYC president in December 2014 at the age of 37. He was seen as a protege of Rahul Gandhi, and had replaced Maharashtra MP Rajiv Satav. Warring had shot to fame as a giant killer in the 2012 assembly elections, snatching the Giddarbaha seat from SAD after 19 years.
 
 He worked with Rahul as all India general secretary of the IYC from 2009 to 2012. It was after Maninderjit Singh Bitta that a Punjabi Congress leader was been given the top job at the party youth wing.
 
 Warring was among frontrunners for a cabinet berth in the recent expansion of council of ministers but could not make it. It is believed that caste arithmetic done by the party went against him. However, an IYC leader said that the process to choose Warring’s successor had begun before that and interviews were already bring conducted.
