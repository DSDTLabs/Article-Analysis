Lucknow: In order to provide   and more   to   and pave way for hassle-free recruitment, the BJP-led government would table around half a dozen bills on Wednesday — ignoring the Opposition boycott — to make suitable amendments in labour laws.

 Labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya told TOI that the government was tabling the bills so that labourers were not exploited and employers didn’t hesitate in giving them jobs.
 
 Maurya said that it was being witnessed that in a number of industries and business concerns — both urban and rural — labourers were exploited due to absence of some regulations. At the same time, employees were facing certain roadblocks while recuiting them, he said, adding “the proposed bills would help both employers and labourers.”
