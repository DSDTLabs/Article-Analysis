NEW DELHI: Flagship explorer   has become the first public sector entity to launch a   programme to train executives on preventing  .

 The move comes as more and more women are making a career in the oil industry, which was so far considered a male bastion. According to ONGC director (HR) D D Misra, the programme will inculcate a sense of responsibility and professional ethics needed for discharging duties more professionally and efficiently.
 
 The programme has been designed to prevent untoward incidents and provide protection against sexual harassment at workplace as well as speedy redressal of complaints. The initiative aims at training and sensitising 3,000 senior executives at the level of deputy general manager and above in the first phase through an e-learning portal launched specifically for this purpose. 
 
 ONGC will impart the training through its intranet site as well as individual versions of tablets and smart phones. The programme consists of three modules and a quiz. The modules cover employee engagement, management awareness and   orientation and regulations.
 
 While the private sector has generally been ahead in following the Visakah guidelines on preventing and tackling issues pertaining to sexual harassment at workplace, the public sector has so far been lagging. The ONGC initiative is expected to spur other major government companies to move on the issue.
