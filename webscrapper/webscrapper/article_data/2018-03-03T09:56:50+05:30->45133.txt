IDUKKI: Twelve anganwadi students have narrowly escaped from a   attack at  , near Munnar. The incident occurred around 4.30pm on Thursday.

  'Padyappa', the notorious wild elephant of Munnar, approached the children when they were returning home from the anganwadi at the colony with a woman. When the elephant chased some panicked local residents, the woman grabbed the kids and ran away. The neighbours later drove the tusker away.
 
  Out of the 12 children, Arumukam (5), son of Manoj, hailing from the colony, was found missing and the local residents frantically searched for him. They later found him inside a temple as he ran into it to escape from the tusker.
 
  The local residents alleged that the tusker has been roaming the area for the past two days. They plan to organize a protest against the authorities' failure to avoid man-animal conflicts. Last week, 'Padayappa' had entered   and disrupted   for over two hours. Last month, it had disrupted a football match.
