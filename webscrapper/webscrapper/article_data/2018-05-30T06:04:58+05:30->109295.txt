CHENNAI: The   police have   a   employee and two of his accomplices for Sunday night’s   of gold   worth Rs 9.3   at a Bank of India branch in Tiruvallur city.

 
 Investigators on Tuesday said they had seized the gold ornaments from the suspects. Special teams led by Tiruvallur superintendent of police Sibi Chakravarthy found that the burglars had used duplicate keys to get past shutters at the entry to the branch.
 
 During questioning of eight employees, the police found that an office assistant, Viswanathan, was in charge of locking up the branch at the close of every working day. “Viswanathan admitted to the burglary,” a senior police officer said. “He said Jai Ganesh, a cashier at a supermarket on the ground floor of the three-storey building, and his friend Gowtham carried out the crime.”
 
 One of Viswanathan’s daily tasks was to make sure a 1.5ft-thick iron door to a strong room was securely closed. 
 
 On Friday evening, he left it unlocked before handing over the keys to the manager, claiming he had locked all the doors. 
 
 “He also switched off CCTV cameras and burglar alarms before leaving,” the officer said.
 
 Investigators matched fingerprints from the crime scene with Viswanathan’s and those of his accomplices. The suspects filled the loot in three bags and hid them on the terrace of the building.
