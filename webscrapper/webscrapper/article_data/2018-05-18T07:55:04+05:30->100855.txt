MOHALI: Two days after a body was fished from the Ghaggar river at Kakrali village of this district, police claim that it is of an Urdu teacher whom someone killed with a blunt weapon. They have registered a case, though not identified the killer.

  victim Anisur Rehman (51) had come from Uttar Pradesh. He lived at Mauli Jagran village with his wife, five daughters, and a son. Preliminary investigation suggests he was hit on the head and pushed into the Ghaggar river. Cops say someone had called him to Ramgarh village. Police had also found a Bajaj Pulsar motorcycle on the scene of crime.
 
 Local people had spotted the body floating in the river and informed police, who moved the body at the mortuary of the local Civil Hospital, where Rehman’s brother, Mujib, identified it on Thursday. Mujib has told police that around 4pm on Tuesday, someone had called his brother. Anisur told Mujib he was off to Ramgarh village for some work, but he never came back.
 
 Assistant sub-inspector Bhinder Singh Khangura said: “We sent his pictures to all the nearby Muslims shrines and today his family spotted one of those portraits in Ramgarh. “It seems that the person who called Anisur to Ramgarh murdered him. We have registered a case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Derabassi police station. We are waiting for the autopsy report.”
