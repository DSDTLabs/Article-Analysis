HYDERABAD: Hyderabad district has seen a three-fold jump in the number of maternal deaths to 105 in 2016-17 from just 31in 2015-16 thanks to the influx of critical cases from not just from   but neighbouring states as well.

 Hyderabad has surpassed Ranga Reddy, Medak and Mahbubnagar in the number of maternal deaths. These three districts had the worst records when it came to maternal mortality in 2015-16.
 
 “It’s not just nearby districts within the state but severe cases from like   in Maharastra border are also being referred to the city. Hyderabad is seeing many more critical cases. Despite best efforts, not all patients survive,” explained Dr Shanta Kumari, chairperson, Indian college of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ICOG- FOGSI). The college operates under the   and Gynaecological Societies of India.
 
  
 What is compounding the situation is complicated cases with severe infection like dengue, chikungunya and swine flu continue to pour into hospitals, said experts.
 
 Telangana is well placed in comparison to other states when it comes to the maternal mortality rate (MMR) that currently stands around 65 per every 1 lakh live births.
 
 As many as 311 women lost their lives during childbirth and related complications during 2016-17 against 326 in 2015-16, as per state health department.
 
 “A small amount of blood loss too can sometimes make a woman haemodynamically unstable and lead to death. In many cases, women come with extremely low levels of haemoglobin. We continue to see pregnant women with haemoglobin counts of 5 and 6 ,” said a senior gynaecologist from a state run maternity hospital.
 
 Haemorrhage is a condition in which a blood loss of 500 ml or more is recorded within 24 hours of birth. In severe cases, the blood loss could be of 1,000 ml or more.
