PANAJI: Close to 400 government primary schools are on the verge of closure, with each having a student enrolment of 20 or lower,   ( ) members said on Monday afternoon, at a demonstration held at the   bus terminus in  .

 Mahesh Mhambre of BBSM said that they want to create awareness among people over the neglect of government primary schools by the state. 
 
 “Statistics clearly show that in the next two to three years, 400 government primary schools are on the verge of shutting down. Some are   and most of them are Marathi. This year, the state has received applications to open 38 more Konkani/Marathi schools, but the state is still dilly-dallying on granting them permission. In the meantime, private English schools are being given approvals. Is the state really in favour of promoting education in regional languages as it claims,” said Mhambre.
 
 BBSM members said that similar demonstrations are being held by them at various locations across the state to draw attention to the issue.
 
 The demonstrators said that the state government is going against its own medium of instruction policy (MoI) announced in 2012-13 to promote primary education in Konkani/Marathi. They said that there is outright neglect of government primary schools, which are shutting down in hundreds in the last few years.
 
 BBSM members said that in a bid to pacify locals, 70 new regional language schools were granted permissions to open in the first year of announcing relaxations for Konkani/Marathi primary schools. But in the following years, from 2013-14 to 2017-18, only 21 of 99 applications received were granted permission.
