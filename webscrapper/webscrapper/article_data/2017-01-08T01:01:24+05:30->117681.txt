Chennai: Tamil superstar Rajinikanth may find it difficult to enter state politics now and Congress should fill the vacuum, former TNCC President EVKS Elangovan said apparently referring to the sudden demise of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.

 “If he (Rajinikanth) had done it 20 years back, it would have been good. I think it is difficult now,” he said here today, adding “this (political) vacuum, the Congress should try to fill.
 
 Responding to reporters' query in this regard, Elangovan said: “Don't say that I am stating it is not possible for Rajinikanth (to foray into politics), but it is difficult”.
 
 It may be recalled that in 1996, Rajinikanth had come out in the open against the then Jayalalithaa government and had backed the DMK-TMC combine which swept that year's Assembly polls. His fans and supporters had in the past urged him to enter politics and float a political party, but the actor has been non-committal in this regard. PTI
