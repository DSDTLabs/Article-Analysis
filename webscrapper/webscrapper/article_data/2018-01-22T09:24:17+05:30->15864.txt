LUDHIANA: Fearing a repetition of the fire and building collapse incident at Suffian Chowk, civic officials have recommended an FIR against private developers constructing flats without a structural safety and no objection certificates from the fire department. The flats — being constructed near   on   — came under the scanner after city-based   activist   raised the issue through his complaint.

 Civic officials claimed they tried stopping developers from constructing the flats earlier too, but now when they are not mending their ways, they have recommended an FIR against them. Assistant town planner of Zone C,  , has recommended FIR against three developers. In a letter to the police, Mangat mentioned that since there was no certificate of either structural safety or fire safety with these developers, another incident of building collapse could be repeated. The flats are being constructed in over two acres of land, and the construction work does not fulfil the requirements of building bylaws.
 
 Khaira said developers were robbing exchequers of various government departments like MC, fire department, and powercom, as construction was taking place without taking permission from the departments concerned. He said a building had collapsed in Suffian Chowk on November 20 last year, and even in that building, the basic parameters were ignored. He said civic officials should take concrete steps against violators, so that people abide by norms, instead of flouting rules.
