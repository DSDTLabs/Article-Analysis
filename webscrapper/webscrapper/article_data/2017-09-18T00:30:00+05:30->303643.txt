Mangaluru: Kudla girl Tanvi Jagadish, a well-known female stand up paddler (SUP), has won the international award, the 'Grom of the Year’.

 This recognition is given by SUP Connect, an organisation based in San Diego, which brings together stand-up paddle boarders around the world. She will receive award in October in the US . 
 
 With this, the 17-year-old young promising surfer Tanvi Jagadish, has become the first Indian standup paddler to won an international award, putting Mangaluru, which is emerging surfing hub, on global map.
 
 “I am very happy to receive this award and this has given a ray of hope for girls to take up surfing as sporting activity to which there is always opposition from parents and society,” said Tanvi while speaking to TOI.
 
 Several stand up paddlers from across the world were shortlisted for the award. Winners were declared online. “Usually foreigners don’t vote for Indians but in my case it was different. They have voted for me generously,” said Tanvi.
 
 Tanvi was introduced to water sports at a very early age by her grandfather and while mother told her that it is impossible for her to go further as she felt it requires more stamina. “It’s not easy to pursue this sport as one needs lot of money to spend on training and equipment. I helped myself and other girls source funds through crowdfunding. Society mocked me saying it’s not girls’ sport but I was clear that ocean is for everybody,” she said. 
 
 She is the winner of national titles in both surf and SUP in India. North Carolina paddler April Zilg, who met Tanvi also helped to pursue her dream. Tanvi hogged limelight in international scene when she attended ISA World Games in Fiji and shared her story.
 
 She is currently pursuing her PUC education in Mangaluru.
