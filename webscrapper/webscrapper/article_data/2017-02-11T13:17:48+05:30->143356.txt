PANAJI: After a   on the edge of a hill slope at Ribandar lopped off a part of the hill, another adjoining slope on   side is being cleared for development.

 Villagers said that the work started and continued in full swing using machinery while authorities were busy during peak election time. “There is a massive felling of trees and land conversion in progress in ward No. 5 in Gaulembhat, Chimbel,” vice president of Chimbel Manch, Gurudas Shirodkar, alleged.
 
 The manch has written to the Chimbel panchayat to look into the matter, as the area was demarcated as no developmental zone (NDZ) in the draft of Regional Plan 2021. “The land being developed is on a steep slope and hence it had been marked as eco fragile,” secretary of the manch,  , said.
 
 Villagers are concerned as large areas of green slopes in Chimbel have already been destroyed by the slums and construction activity spreading into the hills. 
 
 “It has been observed that the work is going on in an area of one lakh sqm and many fruit-bearing trees, such as cashew, mangoes and jack fruits are being cut and the land is being levelled,” the manch stated in its letter to the panchayat.
 
 No sign board, showing details of approvals and licences obtained by the project promoter, has been displayed at the site, the villagers alleged. 
 
 The panchayat has taken cognizance of the complaint. “We have issued a ‘stop work’ order to the party and are trying to get more details,” a panchayat official said.
