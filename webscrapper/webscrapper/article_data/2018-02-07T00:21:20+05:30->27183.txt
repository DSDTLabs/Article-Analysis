Jaipur: BJP’s Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao (BBBP) panel has identified 17 districts in the state where the need for change in mindset of people towards the girl child is badly felt.

 Rajendra  , national in-charge of 'BBBP' campaign, was in the city on Tuesday. He pointed out that they are putting efforts for creating awareness by honouring women who have achieved their goals.
 
 Phadke said, “Sex ratio at birth (SRB) in the state was 929 in 2015-16. There are 17 districts which are having SRB below 929. These are Alwar, Bharatpur, Bhilwara, Chittorgarh, Dausa, Dungarpur, Jaipur, Jaisalmer, Jalore, Jhalawar, Jhunjhunu, Kota, Pratapgarh, Pali, Rajsamand, Sikar and Udaipur. All these districts have been included in the BJP’s BBBP.”
 
 Phadke further said, “There is a need for change in the mindset of people towards the girl child. It can be done by counselling. BJP’s BBBP panel is encouraging people to celebrate the birth of girl child. It is also encouraging schools to celebrate the first 15 days of new academic session by welcoming girl students.”
 
 He said that they are felicitating women who have fulfilled their dreams. They will organise an event for honouring women officers of BSF on February 24 in Jaisalmer. A similar programme will be held in Bikaner on February 22.
 
 “To encourage girls, we are telling them the stories of successful women such as defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Bharat Ratna Lata Mangeshkar, BJP leader Smriti Irani etc. By doing this, we want to inculcate a feeling among girls that if these women can excel in their fields, why can’t they,” said Phadke.
