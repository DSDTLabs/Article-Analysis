NEW DELHI: Indian men’s hockey team’s Dutch coach,  , says he doesn’t want to read too much into the Hockey India’s (HI) infamous ‘hire-andfire’ policy. Before Marijne’s full-time appointment as coach, HI’s report card read ‘23 coaches sacked in 23 years’, which included Marijne’s predecessor  .

 
 
 Though Marijne does not want to show it, the pressure of delivering results must be increasing with each passing tournament. This year is crucial for him in terms of producing results. Five major championships are awaiting the Indians — starting with the   and followed by the  ,  ,   and World Cup. Among them, successfully defending the crown at the Jakarta Asian Games will make India the first team in the world to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
 
 
 “I want to win the Asian Games and the World Cup. Those are my two focus areas. If you win the Asian Games, you become the first team in the world to qualify for the Olympics. So you get almost two years to prepare and that would be perfect. That's what we are aiming for," Marijne said here on Thursday.
 
 So, is he feeling the pressure? “No, I don’t feel the pressure. I believe the highest pressure is coming from within myself. It’s important to be critical to yourself. I want to win everything. The players want to win. They want to have a legacy and you create legacy by winning medals.”
