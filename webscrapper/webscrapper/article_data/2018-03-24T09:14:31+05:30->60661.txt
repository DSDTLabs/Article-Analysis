CHENNAI: A contiguous bus shelter being constructed by   at the   bus terminus is set to offer relief for commuters tired of waiting for buses under the sun. 

 According to corporation officials, the project executed by the special projects cell, is estimated to cost Rs 90 lakh. "The shelter is almost ready. Work on the tensile roof is underway. We expect to complete work by mid-April," an official said.
 
 G Raja, a commuter at Anna Square, told TOI that there was an urgent requirement of seats for passengers at the terminus. 
 
 "Toilet facility is also missing," he said. Corporation officials said that a toilet unit will be added to the terminus upon completing construction of the shelter.
 
 "It is good that they have started constructing before the real summer started. Waiting for a bus in the noon is unbearable," said Dharini, another commuter.
 
 The civic body maintains over 1,800 bus stops in the city. However, in several stops the infrastructure is damaged or absent as TOI exposed in a series of stories last month. For example, commuters wait in the open at the   on the 100 feet  , putting them at risk with onrushing commuters.
