Actor Mandy   enjoyed playing the role of   in 'This Is Us' during different stages of her life. 

 The actor hopes that she would age as gracefully as her character in the hit TV drama.
 
 "I loved it. I thought it was unbelievable, the job that they did because it feels like me, if maybe, just a glimpse into the future if I took care of myself well. 
 
  
  
 "Clearly,   is very hydrated and takes impeccable care of her skin, because I think she looks very good for her age! I loved it," she said. 
 
 Moore said playing the character of Rebecca gave her a chance to look into the future. 
 
 "Ageing doesn't scare me at all. I'm embracing all of that and everything that comes along with it. I loved looking at myself in the mirror and thinking, 'If this is any indication of what I'm going to look like when I'm 66, I'll take it.'"
