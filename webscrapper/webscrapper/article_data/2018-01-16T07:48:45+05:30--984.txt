KOLKATA: A traffic sergeant was beaten up by an auto driver plying on the Golpark-Garia route around 10.45am on Saturday. The accused driver, Shankar  , apparently took a 'revenge' as the sergeant had booked him few days back. Halder has been arrested. 

 The accused had allegedly threatened the sergeant with a chopper then pushed and abused him. The victim, identified as Biprajit  , is presently posted at the   traffic guard. The Golpark-Garia route has hit headlines for several wrong reasons in the past. 
 
 Cops said the motive of the attack is not yet known. "Prima facie, the driver was earlier booked by the sergeant and that might have triggered the act. He had fined the driver near Gariahat few days ago for driving under the influence of alcohol. On Saturday, the accused took up the opportunity to get even at Garia," claimed a source. 
 
 A case has been registered at the Patuli police station under IPC sections 353 (obstructing a public servant from carrying out his duty), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 181 of the MV Act.
 
 The officer said Biswas was on duty in Garia when Haldar spotted him entering the bus number 5 depot and when he came out, the accused suddenly picked up a chopper from a roadside vendor and threatened him. 
 
 When the cop asked him to behave, the accused even pushed him and tried to flee. The sergeant then chased and caught him. Later, a test found he was driving under the influence of alcohol. 
 
 Police sources at   traffic guard said the accused was infuriated as the sergeant had challaned him on a previous occasion.
 
 Altercations between rule-breakers and traffic cops have been on the rise in Kolkata.
