NEW DELHI: More   in Delhi are suspected to be suffering from   disease, a deadly bacterial infection of the equines which can also affect humans.

 According to Delhi government’s veterinary department, samples of   horses from west, southwest, southeast and New Delhi districts have been sent for testing again due to suspicion that they too are suffering from Glanders.
 
 Eight horses at Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care (SGAC) in   in west Delhi tested positive for Glanders in December last year. The government restricted movement of equines — in and out of west district following the confirmation.
 
 Dr  , director of veterinary department, told TOI on Wednesday that if the resampling also finds the 32 horses positive for Glanders they will have to order restriction in movement of equines in other areas as well.
 
 There are around 3,000 equines in Delhi, including those kept by the Army and police. Some of them are used in Republic Day parade. The horses are also used in marriages.
 
 Officials said the authorities concerned needed to screen animals with symptoms such as fever with chills and sweating, and nasal discharge. Prevention in humans involves elimination of diseased animals in most cases.
 
 “There is no need for panic but we cannot be complacent either. We are going to issue an advisory to the animal keepers to give food separately to all horses regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not,” said an official.
 
 Glanders, caused by Burkholderia mallei, is highly contagious among the equines. It spreads commonly by consumption of food or water contaminated by the nasal discharge of an infected animal.
 
 According to a recent research published in Indian Journal of Animal Sciences, Glanders was restricted to certain pockets with sporadic cases till about a decade ago. In the past one year, several cases of Glanders have been reported from UP and MP, alarming veterinary scientists
