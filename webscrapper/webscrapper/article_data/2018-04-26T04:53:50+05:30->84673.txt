THANE: A magistrate court on Wednesday granted   to two Mumbra-based bird traders who were arrested by the forest department on Tuesday for reportedly trading in protected species of wildlife.

 Sameer Safi (28), the owner of the Amrut Nagar-based Royal pet store, and his employee Samadh Khan (22) were booked by the forest department under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act for reportedly selling 79 protected birds, including the winter migratory Ruddy Shelduck.
 
 The forest department had on Tuesday raided two illegal pet shops in Mumbra and found 79 protected bird species. The raids were carried out after a city-based NGO, Wildlife Welfare Association, had received a tip-off that protected birds were being sold here. The NGO spent the past week recceing Mumbra’s Amrut Nagar to confirm that the shops were selling various species of rare birds that are protected under the Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act.
 
 The forest department had sought their remand but the magistrate pointed out that proper process was not followed as the accused ought to have been served a 24-hour notice before the raid, informing them about the action.
 
 Range forest officer Dilip Deshmukh said, “We will prepare a strong chargesheet against the accused. Also, the courts order to release the seized protected birds is likely to be issued by Thursday.” Member of WWA Rohit Mohite said that the seized birds will undergo a health check up and those who are declared healthy and fit to fly will be set free in their habitats.
 
 “The ones which are ailing or weak will be kept in our care till they are strong enough to fly. The vets and bird care experts will certify if they have regained sufficient strength. Only after that they will be released into the wild,” Mohite said.
