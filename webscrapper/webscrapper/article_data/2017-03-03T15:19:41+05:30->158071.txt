Needlework, especially   quilts (commonly known as godhris in the local parlance) was once a very popular tradition passed on by a mother to her daughter prior to the latter’s marriage. This   form, that was on a decline in Goa, was revived a couple of years ago, with fervent efforts made by some enterprising individuals and  

 Although it is not too common in the present era of  , there are a few Goan seamstresses like Anjali Ravindra Haldankar of Borda-Margao, who have preserved making of these godhris by displaying their works at various handicraft exhibitions held in Goa and other parts of India.
 
 Interestingly, this Goan custom of a young bride-to-be displaying her needlework at her mother’s place before her wedding day, has resulted in plenty of orders for Anjali, who has made herself financially independent after her husband, Ravindra, died six years ago.
 
 The 50-year-old commenced taking stitching orders so as to support herself and her teenage daughter, Riddhi. “My 23-year-old daughter has now completed her graduation in commerce stream and aspires to be an air-hostess. I learnt embroidery and crochet from my mother, Premila Shirodkar, who was very active in pursuing this craft till she breathed her last at the age of 85 years,” Haldankar said, adding that she was extremely thrilled with the response of customers when her handmade needle craft items were sold out within five days at the 16-day long handicraft exhibition, held at Amritsar, Punjab, as well as Mumbai. 
 
 Haldankar sells her embroidered pillow cases and bedsheets, crochet items comprising sweaters, socks, blouses, etc, besides the patchwork quilts, bags aprons, and other items in various eye-catching designs at reasonable rates. “The godhris are priced between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, depending on the size,” Haldankar said, Her neatly-designed frocks and caps for infants are also popular among customers, and take her just a couple of days to complete. Godhris with designs such as alphabets, fruits, vegetables, animals and cartoon characters like Pokemon make learning fun for the pre-school toddlers.
