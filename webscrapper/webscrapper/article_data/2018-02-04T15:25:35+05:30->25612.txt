RANCHI: RJD chief Lalu Prasad is keeping a close watch over the political developments across the country, even from inside the jail. Lalu on Saturday said that BJP would lose the parliamentary elections scheduled in 2019. 

 "Mool chunav haar jayega BJP (BJP would lose the main elections)," Lalu said, when told about   winning all three assembly by-polls in Rajasthan and Trinamool Congress securing two in  . Lalu's reaction came while he was being taken to Birsa Munda central jail after his appearance in Ranchi civil court. 
 
 Lalu's close aide and RJD MLA Bhola Yadav mirrored his view, too. He said, "The results of the by-elections in Rajasthan and West Bengal are only the beginning of a downturn for the NDA. It is clear from the results that people have totally rejected PM   and NDA's way of functioning. The real picture would emerge in the coming elections."
 
 Former union minister and RJD leader from Bihar,  , who was present at the court campus on Saturday, said, "The Union government is misusing the law enforcement agencies like   to corner Laluji. But, our party would not fall apart even though our leader is in jail. The party would launch a public engagement programme across the villages."
 
 Lalu on Saturday appeared before the court of special CBI judge Pradeep Kumar in the fodder scam (TC 47A/96) case related to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 139 crore from the Doranda treasury.
