Mumbai: The Centre’s plan to borrow much less in the first half of fiscal 2019, which was announced on Monday after markets closed, led to a rally in the government securities ( ) market on Tuesday. As a result, the benchmark   on the 10-year gilt came down sharply by 29 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) to 7.33% from its previous close at 7.62%. Bond prices and yields are inversely related.

 With the Centre showing its intention to limit the supply of G-secs in the market in the first half, bond dealers expect further softening of yields with the immediate target level at about 7.25%. Since being introduced at 7.17% on January 5 this year, the yields had hardened to a two-year high of around 7.85% in late February. On Monday, the government announced a lower-than-expected borrowing programme for the first half of FY19 at Rs 2.9 lakh crore, or 48% of the budgeted gross annual borrowing of Rs 6.1 lakh crore, compared to about 65% of the gross borrowings in the previous few fiscals being front-loaded. Along with the softening of yields, PSU bank stocks too witnessed strong buying since a rally in   would cut their losses they have in their G-sec holdings.
 
 A report by   noted that along with reduced borrowings, the government has also announced a lower burden in the 10-14 year maturity issuances, with higher issuance in the short-end maturities and floating  . “Increased reliance on government borrowing in the second half of FY19, coupled with improvement in private spending, are likely to result in a crowding-out effect, thus implying hardening of G-sec yields in the latter half of FY19,” the report said.
