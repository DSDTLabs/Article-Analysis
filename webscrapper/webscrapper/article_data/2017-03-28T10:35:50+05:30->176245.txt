Panaji:   MLA from Benaulim,  , has refused to toe his party’s diktat

 days after extending his support to the Manohar Parrikar-led government in the floor test, is refusing to toe the party line and withdraw his vote claiming that he has the support of the people of his constituency in his decision. 
 
 Following his decision to support the government, Alemao had been served a show cause notice by the party seeking reason for his action. 
 
 “I have already given my response. There were no directives from the party before the floor test. The decision to support the government was taken because I want to get work done in my constituency. The people there have supported my decision and urged me to stay with them,” Alemao said to TOI, adding that he is surprised to receive a notice from the party. 
 
 “NCP fielded 17 candidates, but I was the only candidate who won. They should thank me as because of me, their name is on the tally list,” he said, adding that there was no reason to support the   government as they had refused to go into a pre poll alliance with them. 
 
 The NCP leadership has stayed mum on the whole issue till now. State party chief Jose Philip D’Souza has said that he has not received any formal reply from Alemao and any decision would be taken post the reply. 
 
 “The party high command has sent him the notice and he has to reply to it. We will take a decision whatever is decided by them. He has to explain his decision as it is clearly against the party line,” D’Souza said. 
 
 Party sources however mentioned that the party is likely to send Churchill a second notice before taking any decisive action.
