CHANDIGARH: For the first time,   (PU) is going ahead with re-evaluation of the answersheets of the final year MBBS students from the   (GMCH) on the recommendation of the committee constituted for the purpose. The university officials believe that this time many students had unprecedented large number of re-appearances in the final examination of MBBS “which need to be looked into by the PU authorities”.

 The committee is headed by the dean of medical sciences and comprises the senior doctors of   and director of GMCH-32. “This is to bring more transparency and do academic justice to the most professional course, where there is no provision of showing answer book,” said an official from the examination branch, PU. 
 
 Recently, in the first batch of 100 students, 19 final-year medical students flunked, despite getting grace marks. The results of the final-year professional Part II of the MBBS were declared on January 22. The students had written to the vice-chancellor alleging ‘leakage and manipulation of results’
 
 “This re-evaluation shall be open for all the students in the final year. But, we know that even after re-evaluation, those who failed shall get lesser marks than before. We were lenient in the marking,” said a medical teacher from GMCH. Sources said this batch of 2013 was the first to take 100 students. The examination is conducted by the PU. The students had written a request letter to the vice chancellor to allow revaluation. “There are some students who failed by 4 marks. If re-evaluation can help them, it will give them a chance to complete internship on time,” said a faculty. 
 
 Not satisfied by the results, the director-principal of the college had met the students. “The university will look into why so many failed,” said Dr B S Chavan, director-principal, GMCH.
