NEW DELHI: A 45-year-old co-owner of a   manufacturing unit died, while two workers were critically injured when a fire broke out at the   in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri industrial area.

 Chief fire officer, Delhi Fire Service, Atul Garg, said they received a call at 4.15pm and seven fire tenders were sent to douse the blaze at the 200 sq yards unit in Mangolpuri F2/199.
 
 During the cooling operation, the body of Rajesh Gulati, the co-owner, was found inside the factory. The two workers — Chandan Mehta and Lalit Kumar — who suffered burns, are undergoing treatment at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital.
 
 DCP (outer) MN Tiwari said a case under IPC sections of negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter, causing hurt and death due to negligence has been registered.
 
 A preliminary probe revealed that the fire started from the second floor and spread to other parts of the building when work was going on inside it. Panicked workers quickly vacated the building, however, Gulati, who was sitting in his office, failed to escape and died of asphyxiation. 
 
 The cause of fire could not be ascertained due to the presence of highly flammable chemicals stored on all the floors. Police said a team of forensic experts will extract evidence and help find the exact cause.
 
 Gulati was running his cosmetics unit, Shiva Cosmetics, which manufactured nail polish. He lived with his family in Mianwali Nagar in outer Delhi. Police said his body has been kept in a mortuary and will be handed over to the family on Wednesday after autopsy.
