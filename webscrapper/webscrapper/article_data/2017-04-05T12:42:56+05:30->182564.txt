THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government has decided to move a petition before the   seeking more time to implement the court verdict on relocation of all   and serving outlets. The state, which is facing a stiff opposition from the general public while shifting liquor outlets, will seek three more months to shift Bevco's outlets. 

 The decision was taken at a high-level meeting convened by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday. Excise commissioner   will file the petition before the court. The state hopes to get an extension if its difficulties are presented before the court in a convincing manner.
 
 The court had given some relief at places where the population was less than 20,000 by reducing the distance from the highways to 220m from 500m in the original order.
 
 Sources said the government is facing a tough task on the relocation front due to the heavy rent at suitable locations and the public opposition at these locations. Of the 306 outlets (both Bevco and Consumerfed), the state was supposed to relocate 207 as they were near the national /state highways. The state has already shifted 86 such outlets.
 
 This is the third time the state is approaching the court over the same matter. After the court pronounced its verdict on December 15 last year, the state planned to approach the court with an interlocutory petition seeking the exemption of toddy, beer and wine from the definition of liquor and thereby exempting them from the ambit of the judgement. But in the state's Abkari Act, liquor includes spirits of wine, arrack, spirits, wine, toddy, beer and all liquids containing alcohol. The petition was withdrawn by the state.
