MUMBAI: The   in Hyderabad, home to the   franchise, is turning out to a nightmare for cricketers thanks to some serious mosquito menace.

 
 The Mumbai Indians camp, presently set up there ahead of Thursday’s game against the Sunrisers, has had to resort to mosquito racquets inside the dressing room and repellents when out on the field. MI team members, speaking with TOI, said: “It is so bad that someone will get malaria if not looked into immediately”.
 
 The players had to call for half a dozen mosquito racquets to tackle the menace inside the dressing room and were using repellent creams during training sessions. “The local staff came and used some very foul-smelling pesticide spray inside (the dressing room). The smell is so bad and so toxic that the players haven’t been able to even sit inside the dressing room,” team members said.
 
 The MI camp says this isn’t the case with their players alone. Even the players from Sunrisers have been going through the same torture. “The entire playfield is full of mosquitoes and it’s very dangerous. It’s shocking that the authorities aren’t even bothered about it,” say players. Sources in the Rajasthan Royals camp say “Just yesterday we played a game there and yes, we were looking to bring it to someone's notice that the conditions are very bad there”.
 
 For a tournament as high-profile as the   ( ), it clearly doesn’t augur well for its franchise to be so lethargic about basic sanitation-related issues.
