NAVI MUMBAI: The civic body finally got the allotment of a plot measuring approximately 11,000 sq m in sector 30 A,   from   on Thursday. The administration is planning to develop a   lot on the land. 

 The administration is plagued by the lack of parking space, said sources. To address this issue,   had asked for seven plots from Cidco to develop into parking lots. 
 
 “The biggest plot is in Vashi, opposite the defunct Centre One Mall. The plot will be developed with provision for multi-level parking,” said an official from estate department.
 
 NMMC also has plans of setting up similar projects in six other areas of the city. Cidco has already earmarked plots in Belapur, Nerul and Airoli for the same, which will be developed by the civic body.
 
 The civic body will be paying approximately Rs 6 crore to Cidco. “The payments are being made as per the 1994 government resolution of MRTP Act, whereby social facility plot is to be charged at 25% of the ready reckoner rate. Social purpose plots like gardens and playgrounds are to be provided free of cost,” said a civic official.
 
 NMMC is also implementing other measures to streamline parking. Just a week back, officials said that they have converted 39 road side spaces into pay-and-park zones. Tenders to operate them, where around 7,000 vehicles can be parked, has been issued. “We are also confiscating abandoned vehicles, identifying new pay and park zones to address the problem,” said additional municipal commissioner  . —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
