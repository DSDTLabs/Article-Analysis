Panaji: To address the lacunae in cases where crimes have been allegedly committed against women and children, director general of police Muktesh Chander has called for a meeting with NGOs and officers of the women and child cell next month.

 He has requested them to compile and bring to his notice specific cases where there has been slow progress and where there may have been a lapse on the part of the police.
 
 Chander also suggested a week-long self defence workshop for young girls in the upcoming summer vacations for which he assured complete cooperation from the police department. He was speaking on the occasion of International Women's Day celebrated by Bailancho Saad at Institute Menezes Braganza on Wednesday.
 
 He urged women who are abused never to remain quiet out of shame or try to hide an incident. This only encourages perpetrators, he said. Young children need to be made aware of the difference between a good and bad touch, he said, pointing out that often than not perpetrators are lurking within ones own homes and are amongst the most trusted.
 
 He urged parents never to take children's complaints lightly or turn them away when they bring issues to their notice. He also warned them against handing over their children to strangers or persons they are not comfortable with.When the issue of single women complainants being harassed by police were brought to his notice, Chander asked to be informed of specific cases where this is taking place. The issue of domestic violence cases not being registered by the police were also raised with allegations of police refusing to register complaints until a woman shows up at the police station with a member of an NGO.
