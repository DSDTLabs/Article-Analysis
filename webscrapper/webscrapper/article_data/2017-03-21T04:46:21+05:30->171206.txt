GURUGRAM:   of upscale residential society   in   Phase 4 have filed a complaint against the RWA management committee with the district registrar of firms and societies alleging its executive members have siphoned off society maintenance  .

 In a letter to the registrar, Ritu Bagai, one of the residents and RWA members has mentioned that 10 members of   Estate Condominium Association (RWA) have been siphoning off money from the accounts of RWA. Funds are collected from the society members in the name of welfare. The residents have further alleged that the last RWA elections were conducted illegally on December 11, 2016 with people casting proxy votes in owners’ names.
 
 “On the day of election, I witnessed that random people were casting votes in the name of the owners. Voters’ IDs were not being checked,” said Bagai.
 
 The complaint further raised lack of maintenance of the tony society.
 
 A case has been filed by Bagai and other residents against the RWA management committee in the Gurgaon district court. Residents also alleged that the committee has used maintenance funds to pay the lawyer. “The RWA members are using residents’ funds meant for maintenance works to pay the lawyer in the case. The society’s condition, meanwhile, is getting worse,” said Neelkanth, another resident, a senior corporate executive working in the shipping industry.
 
 Registrar Satyanarayan Singh, in reply to the complaint, had asked the RWA management committee to hold a meeting with the residents to address their concerns and sought the panel’s response within two weeks from March 2.
 
 RWA president Sanjay Batra refused to comment on the matter as it is sub-judice.
