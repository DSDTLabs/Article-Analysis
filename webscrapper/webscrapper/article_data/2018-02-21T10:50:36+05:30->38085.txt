 The decision was also taken as Karnataka's gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education is 26.5% and much lower than neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu, which is 46.9%. One of the reasons for this, officials pointed out, is the low pass percentage in the second pre-university ( ) examinations.
 
  "Every year, PU students end up having more than three months of holidays. We want to ensure that the results of the 2019 examinations improve and adding more working days will significantly help achieve this," officials said. 
 
 However,   teachers are not happy with the proposal as it would reduce the number of their holidays. "The department had reduced our winter vacation by seven days last year. Now by cutting down on the summer break, there is not much benefit for us as we will be finishing evaluation and revaluation work and will immediately have to get back to colleges," said a teacher with a Malleswaram PU college, requesting anonymity.
