BENGALURU: From Saturday, people of the state will have a new visitor in their respective localities - a  . Residents of the area are likely to run into constables walking on the streets, in an attempt to familiarize themselves with the locality they will be responsible for henceforth. 

 In an effort to strengthen policing at the grassroots level, the department has entrusted a constable with the responsibility of maintaining law and order in one specific locality.
 
 The constables constitute nearly 80% of the nearly 1 lakh-strong police force in the state, and the new programme will give them a new role. These constables will respond promptly to distress calls in their specific locality. However, these cops will be spared the task of having to maintain law and order on the roads, which will remain under the purview of traffic police. 
 
  "DG&IGP RK Dutta has sent a notice to all police stations in the state, asking them to implement the new system from Saturday (April 1)," said police sources. 
 
  A senior police officer said, "Constables will assigned beats based on the area, and the number of constables within the jurisdiction of the specific police station. The constable will be responsible for curbing illegal activities that are otherwise hard to tackle. These constables, and head constables in the area, who fail to do so, will have to face a departmental enquiry that could even end in suspension." 
 
 Once they have been assigned a specific area or locality, these constables will have to submit a report to their seniors on a regular basis.
