AHMEDABAD: Bootleggers keep on adopting new modus operandi as prohibition laws continue to get stricter. On Sunday,   cops intercepted an ambulance and seized 1,650 bottles of IMFL that were being unloaded for distribution in an auto. Though the driver of the ambulance managed to escape, cops arrested the auto driver, Khemchand  , and seized the ambulance and the auto, along with the bottles of liquor.

 On Sunday afternoon, Ramol police officials received a tip off about an ambulance and an auto carrying illegal liquor about to enter Mahadev Estate in Ramol.
 
 “We rushed to the spot and found that liquor bottles were being put in an auto from an ambulance. The driver of the ambulance escaped on seeing us. However we managed to nab the auto driver,” said a senior police official.
 
 During primary interrogation of the auto driver, it came to light that the ambulance had taken a patient from Civil Hospital to Dahod and had returned in the noon. “Rathod confessed that while the ambulance was used to dodge police pickets and barricades, the auto used to transfer liquor to inner parts of the city,” said a police official.
 
  police said they have launched a hunt for the ambulance driver. “We have his details and very soon will be able to track him. The incident has alerted us to the fact that ambulances, too, can be used to smuggle liquor,” said a police official.
