NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court expressed unhappiness over “unwarranted delays” in deciding parole pleas of prisoners and asked the AAP government to expedite the process.

 The high court said the government must decide the parole pleas swiftly and give reasons in case of delays as there can be “no justification”. A bench of Acting Chief Justice   and C   gave its direction on a public interest plea complaining of delays in disposal of the convicts’ applications for parole or furlough.
 
 The high court said an attempt was made by the Delhi government through the department of home and Tihar Jail officers to explain the difficulties causing delays. However, it noted that though quite a few applications are being decided in accordance with the schedule stipulated in the guidelines, “there are several applications which have not been processed during the stipulated time.”
 
 The bench disposed of the   “with a direction to the respondent (the government authorities) that it shall ensure that the schedule, as prescribed in the Parole/Furlough Guidelines, 2010, is strictly adhered to. In case of any delay, the respondent shall maintain a record of the reasons.
 
 Delhi resident Sanjeev Kumar had moved the court arguing that despite the January 2014 order of the high court to the Delhi government to decide “expeditiously” all parole/furlough applications pending before it within the time limit of three weeks specified in the Parole/Furlough Guidelines 2010, the authorities have failed to comply with it. Advocate  , appearing for the petitioner, submitted that the directions to the government have not been adhered to. Due to the delay, the purpose of the parole application are often defeated, the PIL said.
