Vadodara: Four engineering students of M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering, most of them from humble family backgrounds, have created a history of sorts at the campus. 

 The four chemical engineering students have been selected by the state-controlled Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) which have offered them an annual salary package of nearly Rs 17 lakh. According to the students, it is for the first time that such a high salary package has been offered to outgoing graduates of any stream at the faculty. 
 
 The students - Ravi Vaghela, Vijay Hadiya, Harsh Lathiya and Pratik Bhatt - were selected in the placement drive.
 
 While Ravi’s father is a tailor in Viramgam, Vijay’s father is a diamond worker in Surat. Harsh’s father runs a small embroidery thread shop in Surat and Pratik’s father works with GSFC. 
 
 “We are all excited with the placements that have just got over. Our families were not expecting such high salary packages. But unfortunately, we could not see their expressions while sharing the good news with them,” said Harsh, whose father Rajesh has a shop in Ghanshyamnagar area in Surat.
 
 According to the students, the highest salary package offered at the faculty so far was around Rs 14 lakh per annum which earlier batches of metallurgy and textile chemistry departments have bagged. BPCL was first time recruiter at the faculty and had conducted the interviews on February 15 and February 16. 
 
 “After NIT and IIT, MSU is the first campus where BPCL had arrived for placement of students,” he said. 
 
 The students who are right now preparing for their mid=-semester exams scheduled in first week of March arte expected to join BPCL in July.
