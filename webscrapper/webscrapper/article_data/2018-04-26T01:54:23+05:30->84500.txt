NEW DELHI: Asaram Bapu’s ashram in Karol Bagh has been in the centre of controversy for many years after National Green Tribunal had observed in 2014 that it had “illegal structures” raised in the protected Ridge forest area. 
 
 A functional temple, which is part of the ashram, is built on a patch on the   that had seen demolitions carried out in 2015 on the orders of the green tribunal. This action was in result of a 2014 petition filed in NGT by Sanjay Kumar through his advocate Gaurav Bansal that had claimed that the 4,312-square yard ashram had been constructed illegally and fell on land falling under the Ridge. 
 
 Based on the petition, the tribunal had in 2014 had issued directions to demolish all the illegal structures that were not shown in the initial sketches of the property from August 2002 and by comparing them to the detailed map submitted by the court’s inspection committee in 2014.
 
 “There are substantial changes in the structures existing and area occupied. Presently, (there are) additional rooms, stores, toilets and tin sheds,” NGT had observed. It had also directed the ashram trust to plant at least 1,000 trees in the area within six weeks of the order and to dismantle a sewage pipeline coming from the ashram.
 
 Advocate Bansal, however, had said that a major portion of the ashram was still illegal with the original permission taken only to construct a temple there. The matter was disposed of in 2015 in the NGT after a compliance report was submitted by the inspection committee.
 
 “The have carried out massive construction in the ashram which is against the Supreme Court’s order and is in criminal contempt of  ,” said Bansal.
 
 Forest officials TOI spoke to said they have been following directions of the tribunal and action would be taken if encroachments on the Ridge are reported.
