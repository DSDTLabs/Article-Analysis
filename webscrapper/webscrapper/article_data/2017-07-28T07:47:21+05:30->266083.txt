PUNE: The   (MoRTH) has received a report examining the role and culpability of   in selling cars in India fitted with a ‘defeat device’.

 This was revealed in a reply to a set of Right to Information (RTI) requests filed by TOI over the last four months.
 
 The company has stated that it has not violated any of the in-force Bharat Stage-IV emission norms. It still recalled the vehicles after an   (ARAI) report in 2015 found that its diesel cars were emitting 5-9 times more nitrogen oxide (than in test conditions) when tested on road.
 
 It has been nearly 2 years that the Volkswagen emissions controversy emerged. While other nations like the US have already imposed fines and some in the   are demanding the same, India is yet to fix the culpability of the carmaker.
 
 In a reply to the first RTI filed in March 2017, the MoRTH said, “The report on violation of emission norms by Volkswagen India Pvt. Ltd is awaited.”
 
 In its reply to the second RTI filed in May 2017, the ministry said, “With reference to your queries it is stated that the report on Volkswagen emission has been submitted, which is under further examination by a committee.” 
 
 The ministry, however, refrained from mentioning which   submitted the report. It also avoided answering why the MoRTH is still not insisting on retesting the recalled and fixed vehicles. Also, no answers were given about any plans to penalize the company.
 
 Meanwhile, the company said it has fixed over 50% of the “voluntarily” recalled cars in the country. Though nobody is checking the outcome of the fix, the company says that it has been "approved" by its Wolfsburg headquarters.
