How do you prevent hacking? Simple, suggested this  , by bringing in a state law against hacking.

 Raising the   during the question hour,   wanted the government to bring in a legislation to prevent hackers from entering any computer or website. “We hear that many computers and websites are hacked. We must have a proper act to prevent such hacking,” said Semmalai.
 
 Don’t we have laws that make hacking illegal? Do we need more laws or better policies and funds to guard systems against hackers? Nobody asked.
 
 Since the demand was for a law,   played along, regaling in the fact that the state had passed an e-security act seven years ago. “The act has several checks to prevent hacking, and government is aware about hackers,” said the minister. “And, yes, there is good cyber protection in place in the state.”
 
 At this, the Mettur MLA digressed to the topic of the blue whale game. “Many children are playing the blue whale game on their mobile phone. It is a very dangerous game. What steps has the government taken to prevent children from playing the game?”
 
 When the minister started speaking again, some opposition MLAs pointed out that the minister had used the term ‘Blue tooth’ instead of ‘blue whale.’ “The minister knows the difference between Blue tooth and blue whale,” shot back Manikandan. The Centre has taken steps to block the blue whale game from invading mobile phones in the country.
