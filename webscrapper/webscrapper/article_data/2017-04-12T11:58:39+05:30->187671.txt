PUNE: Two College of Engineering, Pune students, out at 1am on Monday to fetch drinking water, were attacked and robbed by three youths near the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) in Shivajinagar. 

 One of the robbers, Pravin Deshmukh (18), from Undri was caught by the people after the students raised an alarm, but his accomplices fled. Deshmukh was handed over to the Khadki police.
 
 Shankar Bhagit (23) and his college mate Siddheshwar Kolhe are final year bachelor of technology students. They stay with others in a rented flat in a building on Wellesley Road in Shivajinagar.
 
 Bhagit told TOI on Tuesday, “We were thirsty and there was no water in our building. We decided to fetch a bottle of water from the college about five minutes from my residence. Kolhe and I were near the college when three youths on a bike approached us seeking an address near Shivajinagar railway station. They gheraoed us.” 
 
 They were on the overbridge near Sancheti hospital, Bhagit said, and the robbers forced them to use a staircase to go down the bridge. “They took us near Nabard. They first slapped Kolhe and hit me with a stick on my right leg and snatched Rs 100 from my pocket,” Bhagit said.
 
 As per the student, there was commotion and residents from Patil-Estate slums came running to their rescue. “We picked up courage and raised an alarm. Two of the attackers fled on the bike. The residents overpowered the third one and handed him over to the police.”
 
 Bhagit was sent to Sassoon General Hospital for treatment and is stable. He has filed a complaint against the robbers under sections 392 (robbery) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC.
 
 Sub-inspector Shivaji Bhosale from the Khadki police station said Deshmukh has given them the names of his accomplices, but their whereabouts are not known. “We got back the Rs 100 from Deshmukh. They may be involved in more robberies.”
