Vasco: An altercation over passengers between two groups of private taxis outside Dabolim International Airport turned ugly on Sunday after a driver, who tried to break up the fight, was hit on the head with a beer bottle. Police said that Rizwan Khan had attempted to resolve the fight that broke out around 1am, when one driver caught him from behind while another attacked him with a beer bottle. Khan was rushed to GMC where he was administered stitches. The attackers — Surendra Naik and Amit Gawde — fled from the scene. They were arrested later and a case filed against them.
