NEW DELHI: Congress stepped up attack on PM   over alleged   pay-offs, pointing out that the   has said that the government did not submit “corroborative evidence” to back the papers mentioning the beneficiaries.

 The I-T ruling that the “loose papers” which were seized in the raids on corporates have no evidentiary value has sparked a political controversy.   spokesman Randeep   said, “The commission says we are not going to accept these papers as it is because the I-T department had to bring corroborative evidence.”
 
 He said, “What is that corroborative evidence? Person who has received the money must be investigated and the courier must also be investigated. But did the I-T department do so? The answer is again No.”
 
 The opposition party asked why is the PM not instituting an independent probe when the commission has said that the ownership of the seized documents is not doubted. The Sahara diaries were recovered from the business house following I-T raids in November 2014 listing the alleged pay-offs to politicians.
 
 Surjewala said, “Modiji claimed that he was a watchman of the country’s trust and treasure chest. Shocking and scandalous facts in ‘Birla’ and ‘Sahara’ papers now require an independent investigation.”
 
 He said the government should answer as to how the commission could settle the entire matter of Sahara papers in only 16 days and why it was in a “tearing hurry” to close this entire issue.
 
 AICC spokesman alleged that the ‘Sahara Group’ appears to have gained a concession of not paying   on the income of Rs 1,910 crore and received complete immunity from penalty and prosecution.
 
 “What is the underlying reason for showing such benevolence to an industrial house, which has been caught with unaccounted cash and papers reflecting non-disclosure of income running into a few thousand crores?” he asked.
