Nagpur: Manoj Lakde (20) hit below the cot of his neighbour’s house at Vaishali Nagar and attacked him with a sharp weapon when he suddenly arrived, on Tuesday.

 Sources said Lakde has an illicit relationship with his neighbour Prafula Dongre’s wife. On Tuesday, the accused was in Dongre’s house when the latter, a driver by profession, came home all of a sudden. 
 
 Police said Dongre’s wife got scared and told Lakde to hide under the cot. Dongre slept on the same cot and heard some sound from below. As soon as he bent down, Lakde attacked Dongre on his throat with a sharp weapon. Dongre immediately alerted other neighbours who informed the cops.
 
 Beltarodi police registered a case of assault against Lakde and have arrested him.
