MUMBAI: The   has been awarded international accreditation by the Council of International Schools ( ) and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges ( ).

 There are seven schools in India which have received Joint Accreditation by CIS and NEASC. To be CIS accredited, the school must carry an in-depth self-study aimed at strengthening the school’s programmes and operations. The institution must also demonstrate that the school delivers what it promises in its own philosophy and objectives. Going forward, it must commit to continuing action to address recommendations arising from the internal and external evaluations and thus demonstrate dedication to on-going school improvement.
 
 Said founder Nita Ambani, “The accreditation, which is an expression of confidence in the institution's purposes, performances, and sufficiency of institutional resources, has given a further impetus to our school’s culture of excellence and collaborative spirit.” The school’s five-year strategic plan, which evolved as a part of several rounds of reflections and deliberations at various levels, helped the institute identify the school’s strengths as well as areas that need to be strengthened, she added. “It encapsulates the ethos and future direction of our school.”
 
 For students this translates to the fact that the schools that are CIS accredited demonstrate their commitment to international education and continual improvement. Colleges and universities acknowledge that a CIS accredited school meets globally recognised standards and promotes qualities and skills that they are seeking in students. Schools throughout the world recognise CIS accreditation, and the education received by the student, as meeting an international standard. Over 400 schools world-wide now hold accredited status with the CIS.
