CHENNAI: Three knife wielding men gang barged into a railway employee's house at Madhavaram on Wednesday, tied up the three residents and made away with 35 sovereigns of gold jewellery worth around 9 lakh. A few neighbours who heard the residents' cries for help rushed to the house, untied them and alerted police. 

 The residents were in a state of shock. Based on a complaint of Vijayakumar, a railway employee, the Madhavaram police registered a case and launched a hunt. 
 
 A team led by inspector Sankar arrived, questioned several of the family's neighbours and collected CCTV footage from nearby shops. 
 
 Police said Vijayakumar, his wife Neelaveni and her brother Dhanasekar were taken aback when three strangers wielding knives stormed into their house at Tapal Patti in the afternoon. They latched the door from inside and warned the residents against raising an alarm. The gang members did not bother masking their faces and were well built, police said, based on the victims' accounts. 
 
 One of them asked Neelaveni for the cupboard key and she handed it over. The others walked into the bedroom where the cupboard was kept, took the valuables and made good their escape.
