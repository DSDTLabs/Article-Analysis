I am not asking them to remove other   films for my film, but at least give first preference to Kannada films instead of non-Kannada films. Something like this won’t happen in other states,” Sathish said. Beautiful Manasugalu releases on January 20 and the film faces tougher challenges after that.
  
  “I am worried about the two big Hindi films the week after that. Our film is aimed at the multiplex audience. But when films of   and   release, the shows for our film will certainly be cut,” he said. However, postponing the release is not an option.
  
  “The Bengaluru Inter-national Film Festival will take place in the first week of February. Then there are the three big Kannada films — Hebbuli, Chakravarthy and   lined up. I will have to wait for at least three more months for the   and board exams to get over. So I have no option but to release the film now,” he said.
