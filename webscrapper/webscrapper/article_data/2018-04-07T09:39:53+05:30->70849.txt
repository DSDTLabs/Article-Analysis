THRISSUR : The   has decided to launch a protest against the devaswom decision to permit special darshan at the   to the devotees who give Rs 1,000 as offering.

 BJP district president   said the decision was part of a design to commercialise Lord Guruvayurappa, the presiding deity of the temple, by the devaswom managing committee nominated by the LDF-government.
 
 The BJP leader termed the decision as a “challenge to the devotees” who believe that the lord does not discriminate between the rich and poor. Nagesh slammed the argument that the move was aimed at curbing the tendency of some devaswom staff to fleece the devotees by allowing for special darshan informally. “If the devaswom managing committee members can’t curb such  , they must quit,” Nagesh said.
 
 However, managing committee member   said the decision was taken to help the devotees. There is no intention to commercialise the temple. The amounts offered by the devotees will go to the temple, he said. He said that such a practice had existed in the temple earlier
