THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as CPI continues to be in a denial mode about LDF’s alliance with Kerala Congress (M), party chairman K M Mani said on Friday that LDF candidate for Chengannur has requested the support of his party. Mani’s revelation came in the backdrop of CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran’s insistence that there shouldn’t be any truck with Mani.

 Mani told reporters here that   met him on Thursday and sought his support for the bypoll. “One is requesting for help while another party says they need no help at all,” Mani said. KC (M) Alappuzha district president also expressed open support to Saji Cherian on Thursday. Cherian was in Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday to meet veteran   leader V S Achuthanandan and in between he had a brief meeting with Mani too.
 
 CPI national secretary D Raja, who was in the city, said that the stand of CPI was what   said.   had a discussion with CPM central leadership on Thursday along with his party general secretary Sudhakar Reddy. During the discussion in New Delhi, CPI and CPM central leaderships reached an understanding that the decision on any alliance with Mani needed to be taken in Kerala.
 
 CPM general secretary  , who was also in the city, endorsed Thursday’s decision and said the LDF would discuss the issue and take an appropriate decision.
