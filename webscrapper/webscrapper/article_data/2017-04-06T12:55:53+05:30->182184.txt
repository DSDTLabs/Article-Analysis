VISAKHAPATNAM: Indira Gandhi   rushed to Vajrapukotturu village near Palasa in   on Tuesday and rescued a sloth bear after receiving information from principal  ,  , N Prateep Kumar.

 It took 15 veterinary and forest personnel almost two hours to rescue the animal as it was caught in a trap placed by farmers for wild pigs. They tranquillised the freed animal as part of the rescue operation since the bear was in stress and frightened.
 
 “The bear with suspected internal injuries was transported to Vizag’s   and housed in the night kraal for further physical and behavioural observation. The zoo personnel are stabilising the animal. As per the instructions of principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden, it will be decided whether to free the animal into the wild or retain it in the zoo,” said zoo curator B Vijaya Kumar.
