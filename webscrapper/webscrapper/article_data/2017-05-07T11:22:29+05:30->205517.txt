PANAJI: Beach shacks along the state’s coastline are likely to benefit from an amendment in the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification (CRZ), 2011, as they will be allowed to retain the structures during the June-August monsoon season.

 The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has carried out further amendments to the CRZ notification, 2011 to this effect, but a pre-condition is that the shacks remain non-operational during that period.
 
 The shack operators on Goa’s beaches dismantle their temporary structures after the tourism season ends in May and reconstruct them for the season in September/October every year.
 
 The shack owners had complained to then forest and environment minister,   that erecting shacks is not economical and it affects their business dealings. The state government had taken up the matter with the central government and the ministry had issued a draft notification dated April 25, 2016, for suggestions and objections from the public.
 
 In the past, licences issued for erection of beach shacks were valid for a period of one year, but the government changed its beach shack policy in 2012, increasing the validity period to three years. And, at the end of every season, shack operators had to dismantle their structures. Some environmentalists had objected to the move to allow shacks during the monsoon season, as this would encourage the operators to resort to illegalities. Further, they had cited environmental reasons, as beach morphology undergoes changes during monsoon.
 
 The amendment states the clearance granted to projects under the notification will be valid for five years. Another amendment states the project proponent should submit half-yearly compliance reports as per the terms and conditions of environmental clearance.
