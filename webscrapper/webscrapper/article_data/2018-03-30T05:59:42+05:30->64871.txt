CHANDIGARH: For the past seven years, the   government had been "inadvertently" paying a part of the income tax of the MLAs in the state assembly. The payment was made despite the Haryana state assembly rules not making any provision for the government to pay the tax. 

 The Haryana assembly secretariat admitted the error in an RTI reply to Ambala-based lawyer  . The reply also said that the government has so far paid Rs 48 lakh to the tax officials.
 
 "(According to) Section 8 of the   (allowances and pension of members) Act 1975, the state is liable to pay income tax on the allowances being drawn by the members and not on the salary being drawn by them," says the RTI reply by the income tax cell of the assembly. "However, the   has been depositing/paying the income tax on the salary too inadvertently by misconstruing the said provisions since the financial year 2010-11 to 2017-18."
 
 Till 2011, Haryana's MLAs received only allowances as there was no provision for salaries. It was the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government that introduced salaries for the MLAs which were paid from September 2010 when a bill was passed by the assembly. Initially, the salary was Rs 10,000 a month, which has now reached Rs 40,000.
 
 The RTI reply says that Rs 48,14,220 have been wrongly paid to income tax authorities. Haryana has 90 MLAs. The tax was paid on the salaries of 74 MLAs. There are separate provision for salaries of the remaining 16 MLAs, which includes the chief minister, ministers, speaker and deputy speaker.
 
 The highest amount - Rs 18 lakh - was paid to the income tax authorities in 2016-17. Hemant Kumar said that he has now written to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Haryana parliamentary affairs minister   and speaker   Pal to stop the illegal payment from state exchequer.
