PUNE: Those arrested in   in the city thus far have been mainly local criminals or those from nearby towns and villages. But the two chainsnatchings that happened barely 15 minutes apart at Kalyaninagar and   on February 15 were committed by two men from Delhi, who seem to be no penny pinchers considering that they took a flight from the capital to come to the city. 

 The two men,   and  , both school dropouts, were nabbed at the Delhi airport on Sunday morning. For the past two months, the police were looking for them because of their involvement in several chainsnatching cases in the capital and Gurgaon. It was not known when they slipped out of Delhi and came to Pune. The Delhi police learnt that they were in Pune only after they used their cellphones to book their air tickets back to the capital and a radio cab to take them to the Lohegaon airport. 
 
 Senior inspector Sanjay Naik-Patil of the Airport police told TOI that the two men were staying with a friend at Nigdi. "They used a toy gun to threaten the two senior citizens whose chains they had snatched here," he said.
 
 Assistant inspector Muralidhar Khokhle, who is investigating the case, said the police had obtained   footage of the two chainsnatchings and of the duo fleeing on a scooter. "We suspect that duo sent the scooter, which bears a Delhi registration number, by train to Pune. We seized the scooter from their friend's house at Nigdi," he said.
 
 The robbers, who were wearing caps but had not covered their faces, first targeted a 72-year-old man, who is the director of a private firm, while he was out on a walk in Kalyaninagar at 7.15am.
