PANAJI: On a day   was scampering to find a “credible candidate”for the Panaji seat, Manohar   dished out an advice to them: Withdraw from the fray and save yourself from further embarrassment.

 “If the Congress had taken a stand to not contest, their prestige would have risen. Keeping their cards close to their chest and not contesting would have been better than this embarrassment right now, where they cannot get a candidate. They could have just said that he is the chief minister so we leave the seat, let him get elected unopposed.” 
 
 Parrikar, who is expected to file his nomination papers on Wednesday, told a gathering of party workers: 
 
 Telling his partymen to ensure a high turnout and ensure a record winning marging for BJP, Parrikar praised former Panaji mayor and four-time   mandal president Ashok Naik, who rejected a Congress ticket.
 
 “I think Ashok Naik has remained true to his roots and has kept his origins intact. He has recognised that he is part of BJP and thus he cannot be a Congress candidate. I am grateful to him,” Parrikar, a five-time MLA from Panaji, said.
 
 Making a fervent appeal to the party workers to rally behind him and to also convince voters sitting on the fence, Parrikar promised to complete all infrastructure and development works in Panaji within a year.
 
 “For Panaji’s development, especially its infrastructure, all the works will be completed 365 days after the results are declared. Till date, I have just made announcements. All the works in Panaji will be listed out and will be completed. Money and manpower will not fall short,” Parrikar, who has never lost from Panaji, said.
 
 Along with Parrikar, former Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienkar, BJP general secretary  , mandal president Deepak Mhapsekar and councillor Vaidehi Naik urged the party workers to ensure that BJP won the elections with a historic margin.
