What’s in a kiss? A lot, if you ask the makers of the TV show Prithvi Vallabh. 

 Incidentally, a lip-lock scene was planned between the show’s lead couple —   and  . However, both of them refused to kiss on screen. 
 The makers respected their sentiments, but since the kissing scene was an integral part of the script, they couldn’t scrap it. The actors finally agreed to do a cheat-shoot for the sequence.
 
 When contacted,   said, “I didn’t feel the need to do it and I conveyed as much. I have no apprehensions about locking lips; it’s just that I will do it only when necessary.”   added, “I kissed in a film, and wasn’t really comfortable, which showed on screen. Fortunately, the makers understood our point eventually."
