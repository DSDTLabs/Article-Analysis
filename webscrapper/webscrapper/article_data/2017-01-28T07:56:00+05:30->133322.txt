Gurgaon: The highway administration court has set a deadline of mid-February for repair work on   on either side of the   near Kherki Daula. It has warned concessionaire Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL) of strict action if the deadline is not met. MCG will bear the cost of road repair.

 A senior official of National Highways Authority of India told TOI on Friday that “the service lanes on both sides of the expressway were damaged by heavy rains and waterlogging during the last monsoon. MCEPL was asked to repair the roads. It restored the damaged parts of the expressway service lanes, but a stretch of around 800 metres near Kherki Daula — 690 metres near Anaj Mandi on Jaipur-Delhi side and around 100 metres on Delhi-Jaipur side — was not repaired”.
 
 The battered stretch has been causing traffic snarls in the area and the matter was brought to notice of the highway administration court, which gave its order on January 23, the official said. During the hearing, MCEPL had sought at least one month to carry out the repair work, but the court fixed mid-February as the deadline.
 
 “We have been directed to submit the statement of final expenditure to independent consultant for final verification by Februrary 9. This will include expenses for both immediate as well as permanent restoration work. The matter will be taken in the highway administration court again on February 23 and by then, all work will be completed,” said S Raghuraman, CEO of MCEPL.
