SURAT: Two children of labourers fell to death from an under-construction building in Kosad area of the city where their parents were employed. The children fell from the second floor while playing.

 Police identified the deceased as seven-year-old   Mukesh Katara and one-year-old   Rakesh Bhuriya. They were playing on the second floor of the under-construction building in   area. While Suryakumari died on the spot, Shailesh died during treatment in a hospital.
 
 The children were playing on the ground during the day, while their parents were busy in work. Since the building is under construction, the access to staircase was open and they went up to the second floor. Some portion on the floor had an incomplete work. The children went close to a passage where there was a hollow gap and fell down to the ground floor. Soon, an ambulance was called. The paramedics with the ambulance declared the girl dead and rushed Shailesh to the hospital where he died.
 
 Suryakumari and Shailesh were cousins and their families came from Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. Their parents were employed as construction labourers at the building. Shailesh’s father Rakesh had been working at the construction project since the last few weeks, while Suryakumari’s father Mukesh came to work here recently.
 
 “Our preliminary investigation has revealed that the children fell while playing on the second floor. We are recording the statements of those present at the building to find out more details,” said a police official.
