The Kapoor household is teeming with work, with patriarch  , daughter Sonam and son   in the thick of their respective projects. If reports are to be believed, the father-son duo might share screen space in an upcoming film.

 
  
 According to reports, Harshvardhan has been approached for the   biopic. The film is being helmed by ‘Ek Thi Daayan’ director Kannan Iyer. While Harshvardhan will play the ace shooter, his real-life father Anil has been reportedly offered the role of Abhinav’s father AS Bindra. 
  
 Abhinav’s father played a large part in his success, as he invested in a farmhouse after Abhinav’s return from the Sydney Olympics. This is where he honed his skills and practised for hours on end.
