NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD: China on Thursday dismissed as “shocking and baseless” a media report that President   has asked Pakistan to explore ways to relocate Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed to a West Asian country amid mounting international pressure to act against him for his links with terror groups.

 
 According to the report, a close aide of Pakistan Prime Minister said that Xi made the suggestion to   during their meeting on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in China last month.
 
 Terrorism was a subject that occupied some of the discussions between PM   and Xi Jinping during their summit in Wuhan recently. Modi laid out India’s concerns on cross-border terrorism, stressing how it has been a deal-breaker in India-Pakistan bilateral engagements.
 
 But sources familiar with the talks said there was no mention of specifics, largely because in the Chinese scheme of things, specifics are left to officials. The Wuhan summit saw the two leaders engage in conversations about the larger relationship and on global issues, but there was nothing on Saeed. Apart from the fact that China would not want to run down its staunch ally Pakistan in a meeting with India, China has refused to allow Jaish-e-Mohammed’s Masood Azhar to come under UNSC sanctions, blocking the proposal for a couple of years, which has created fissures between Beijing and New Delhi. Despite blocking India’s request, China has long been pursuing Pakistan to revisit its policy towards militant factions like JeM and Mumbai attacks mastermind   Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamat-ud-Dawa.
