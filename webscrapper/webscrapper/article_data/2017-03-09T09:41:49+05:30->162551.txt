KERI: The common perception about Goa across India that   through its every nook and corner is untrue as there are certain villages which do not have even a   or a bar.

 People here have restricted themselves from   as they believe that any indulgence would expose them to the wrath of their presiding village deity.
 
 In Mencurem village, people firmly believe that goddess Mauli will severely punish them if they get involved in  . Similar is the belief in villages such as Cotambi and Shirgao, where the presiding deities are Lord Chandreshwar and goddess Lairai, respectively.
 
 Babali Parab, a Mencure resident says, “Since generations our village has zealously maintained the tradition of not allowing any bar or liquor outlet. Till this date no one has dared to break the taboo.”
 
 In Sattari taluka, where Goa’s only temple dedicated to Lord Brahma exists, people restrain from liquor business. So is the case in Copardem, where people fear presiding deity Brahmani. While the neighbouring areas have a number of bars selling ‘urrak’ and ‘feni’, this village has maintained its tradition.
 
 Morpirla, a tribal-dominated village in Quepem, where people worship Lord Shiva, there are no liquor outlets. The villagers here have not allowed anyone to set up bar and even resolved not to allow the same in future. In the past, forest dwelling Velip tribals never used to drink alcohol. But today, this tradition is fast disappearing as bars and outlets are being set up in their villages.
 
 Psychiatrist Rupesh Patkar, when contacted by TOI, said, “Alcoholism in Goa is responsible for ruining happiness of many families, deteriorating people’s health and also disturbing peace and tranquility. We have to uphold the tradition of villages having no bars.”
