NOIDA: As many as 35   were evicted from the   premises in Sector 32 on Monday. The move comes a day after minister of state (independent charge) Swantantra Dev Singh visited Noida and announced stringent action against the officials who fail to control touts extorting money from visitors at the transport offices.

 A team of clerical staff evicted the touts who were a usual sight outside the department and would extort money from visitors for getting their work done. They were said to have good understanding with insiders who helped them get their work done quickly. To get a permanent driving licence, an agent could charge as much as Rs 4,000, while the same is issued for Rs 200 at the office.
 
 ARTO   said the touts were “evicted” from the premises by the administration.
