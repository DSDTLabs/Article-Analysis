PANAJI: Despite several initiatives, the capital city’s rank in the Swachh Survekshan 2017 plunged to 90 from the commendable 16 accomplished last year. The annual cleanliness   indicates that authorities failed to maintain and better sanitation standards achieved in 2016 and 2014. Citizen participation, lack of gender and disability friendly infrastrastructure and elimination of open defecation were the factors that went against  .

 Panaji scored high marks for solid waste collection, disposal of garbage, supply of basic amenities. Civic authorities on their part attributed the poor showing in 2017 to the increase in the number of cities surveyed. 
 
 While 75 cities across India were surveyed in 2016, the   (QCI), an autonomous body, evaluated 434 cities this time around, the Union ministry of urban development said.
 
 A saving grace for the tourist state’s capital is that Panaji garnered an overall score of 1,271, which is higher than the national average of 998.
 
 Indore in Madhya Pradesh emerged as the cleanest city in the country, notching a score of 1,808 points while Gonda in Uttar Pradesh was declared the dirtiest city.
 
 The survey found that more than 80% of the Corporation of the City of Panaji wards were covered by door-to-door waste collection. The survey also found that 84.38% of Ponjekars found their city cleaner than the previous year.
 
 With a little more than 75% of the wards being identified as open defecation free, the civic body has a lot more to do to achieve 100%.
 
 In 2016, Panaji scored a decent 330 out of 500 in the Swachh Survekshan 2016 survey of 75 cities across the country to bag the 16th position. Panaji’s residents, especially the 627 who did participate in the survey, clearly indicated that there was a lot more to be done in Panaji.
 
 The Union ministry of urban development commissioned the massive survey of cities and state capitals to gauge the seriousness shown by states to clean up urban spaces.
 
 Panaji scored well in waste management and public sanitation, scoring 182 points out of 200 for processing and disposal of waste and 135 points out of 150 for public and community toilets. Despite this, just 17% of citizens agreed that there were community and public toilets available in the city.
 
 CCP, which takes care of garbage collection, appears to have improved daily door-to-door garbage collection with a higher number reporting satisfaction with the daily collection of segregated garbage. In 2016, slightly less than half of those surveyed said that their household garbage was collected on a daily basis.
