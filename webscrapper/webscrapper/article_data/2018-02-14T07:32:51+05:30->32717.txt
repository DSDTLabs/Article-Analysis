KOLKATA: The state transport department is making   more accountable and bringing in certain changes in the certificate of fitness (CF) and permit conditions. The transport department and   are also making each bus driver-specific so that accountability could be fixed.

 Kolkata Police is procuring records of drivers of buses in each route. If a bus is run by five different drivers, Kolkata Police and the transport department will be instructing the drivers’ union — which distributes the duty roster of the drivers — to make sure that the bus is run by these five drivers only. “If anyone else drives the bus it can even lead to to cancellation of permit,” said deputy commissioner (traffic)  .
 
 
  
 
 The transport department is also introducing a sticker with urgent reminders to bus drivers that will have to be pasted on the windscreen so that it warns a driver against the violations. The buses without such stickers will not be given certificate of fitness.
 
 The recent memorandum issued by the transport department has also made it mandatory for franchises operating under state transport utilities (STUs) to follow certain requirements for safety and security of the passengers. The state is, thus, reviewing all existing agreements.
 
 All buses must be fitted with GPS/GPRS and emergency buttons as required under Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 (amended). The memorandum has also made periodic checking and maintenance of vital parameters like tyres, braking system and steering system mandatory. Antecedents of the driver will have to be verified from local police to ascertain existence of no criminal record in last seven years.
 
 The new advisory said buses should be run only on routes mentioned in the agreement or declared in the permit. “No passenger can be carried on the roof-top of a bus. No goods other than the personal luggage will be allowed in passenger buses,” said the new norms.
