Nagpur: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd ( ) regional director,  , has frozen the house rent allowance (HRA) of 81 discom staffers who were found frequently absent from their place of work. Such action was taken against several employees in the past also, but 35 employees failed to mend their ways. Show-cause notices have been issued to them asking why they should not be suspended.

 Khandait had sacked 25 employees for absenteeism last week. Termination of service of nine more employees is in the pipeline due to the same reason.
 
 A source in the MSEDCL said that several complaints were received from consumers regarding delay in restoration of power supply following breakdown due to rains. When senior officials enquired into the complaints, they found out that many employees were absent without leave. A compiled report was submitted to Khandait who then decided to take stringent action against the erring the staffers.
 
 Among the employees who have been punished, 14 are from Wardha circle while 10 each are from Buldhana, Yavatmal and Nagpur Rural circles. The corresponding figure for Akola is 9, Amravati 8, Washim 7, Gadchiroli 5, Nagpur Urban 4, Bhandara 3 and   1.
 
 Among the employees who were issued show-cause notices, 18 are from Nagpur Rural circle. Twelve are from Wardha circle, four from Nagpur Urban and one from Yavatmal.
 
 Earlier, Khandait had directed all the chief engineers and superintending engineers in Vidarbha to ensure that employees remain present at their place of work. He had also asked them to submit list of erring employees to the regional office.
 
 The decision of energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule to set up regional offices is paying dividends. Closer supervision of field staff is possible by regional directors, which the chairman-cum-managing director was unable to do from Mumbai.
