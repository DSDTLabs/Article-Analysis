NEW DELHI: Days after it was denied a common election symbol, Yogendra Yadav’s   has asked all its candidates to use their photographs as the   while campaigning in their wards. It is for the first time a candidate’s photograph will be there on the EVMs.

 “We have asked candidates to select one photograph and use it on all campaign-related materials so that people remember it. Irrespective of whatever symbol they get, people will remember the candidate’s face,” said Anupam, Swaraj India’s spokesperson.
 
 The party has asked candidates to use their photograph in the form of cutouts, on banners, pamphlets and badges, along with Swaraj India’s flags while campaigning in their areas.
 
 While the party admits that the recent order by the election commission is a setback to the newly-formed party’s ambitious plan of a large-scale common campaign for the municipal elections, some members claim it has only “strengthened their resolve” to fight for transparent and accountable governance. “Had we been given a common symbol, we would have received the same number of days to publicise it. So, first priority is to publicise candidates’ photographs followed by the election symbol allotted to them by the commission,” added Anupam.
 
 In the absence of a common symbol, the party is using the yellow (Basanti) colour as its symbol during the election campaign. “Our candidates and volunteers wear Basanti colour clothes while campaigning,” he added.
 
 Accusing AAP of playing dirty politics, Swaraj India members said the ruling party was trying to misuse its power to stop them contesting the elections. “Despite being a registered political party, we didn’t get a common symbol because of AAP’s dirty ploy. AAP, which ironically was the first beneficiary of the election commission’s order to grant a common symbol to registered political parties, is not implementing the new rule to block us,” he added.
