MOHALI: The   municipal corporation is all set to take over possession of all parks and green belts in the city for their maintenance. At present the parks are looked after by the   ( ). In all Mohali has 10 major parks and over 400 medium and small parks and an equal number of green belts. 

 Municipal commissioner   said they will get Rs 50 crore annually as grant from Gmada for maintaining the parks. "Earlier GMADA had possession of the parks in the city and we would be held responsible for their poor upkeep by residents," he said. "Every time we received a complaint we had to tell the complainant that the parks were being maintained by Gmada. But now, will be fully responsible for the maintenance of these parks."
 
 He added that residents often complain about vehicles being parked in the parks and green belts. Children were deprived of playing in the parks as these were over-crowded with parked vehicles.
 
 Deputy mayor   said, "This was a long-pending demand of the residents for maintaining the parks. Vehicles being parked in parks is another a major complaint of the residents which will also be adddressed once the municipal corporation gets possession. Gmada failed to maintain the parks. We will hopefully be able to maintain the parks better and also remove the illegal use of these green belts so that children can play in them."
 
 There are a total 556 parks in the city. Of these, 109 are maintained by resident welfare associations. For their maintenance, Gmada pays the associations Rs1.67 per square feet.
