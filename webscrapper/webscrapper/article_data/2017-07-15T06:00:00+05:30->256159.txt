Visakhapatnam: Roads and buildings minister Ch   met the Special Investigation Team (SIT) officials at Yeleru Guest House near AU Engineering College grounds on Friday and submitted documents pertaining to the land scam involving around 1,600 acres in the district. He will meet the team again on July 19 with more details regarding the scam.

 Addressing the media, the minister said that he had informed chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and the revenue minister about the ongoing scam way back in 2014 and had also urged them to take action against the offenders. “I know Vineet Brijlal since his tenure in Narsipatnam. I have full faith on SIT. The government is focused on taking action against the persons involved in the land scams irrespective of party affiliations,” he said.
 
 “It is unbelievable that the land grabbers even mortgaged roads and took Rs 190 crore loans from banks. I will submit those details also,” he added. He further said that the land grabbers took compensation money from the government by producing false documents regarding government land allotted for the proposed MedTech project at Pedagantyada mandal. “I wrote to the district collector asking him to stop all payments and verify the facts. But there was no response and payments were initiated,” he alleged.
