MANGALURU: The   on Thursday shot off a 10-point questionnaire to   president  , demanding that he answer them during his ongoing tour of  .

 Aimed at countering   on his assertion that he is not being allowed to speak in Parliament over contentious issues even for 15 minutes, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said answering the questions won’t take as much time as the   chief has a limited capacity to speak solo. “Jahan Jahan tum (Rahul) jaaoge (in Karnataka), hum (BJP) peecha nahin chodenge,” Patra said.
 
 The questions ranged from spiralling farmers’ suicides in Karnataka to abject neglect of development needs of Bengaluru and drop in the state capital’s Swachh Bharat rankings.
 
 “Rahul, who is harping on RTI Act as Congress’ gift to India, should answer why his government in Karnataka weakened the Sakala Act introduced by the previous BJP government,” Patra demanded. Rahul, who is ridiculing Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign of the NDA government, should answer for the 800-plus rapes of Dalit women in Karnataka, 7,523 murders of women in the state and 3,857 instances of sexual assault on them in last 5 years, he said.
 
 Patra wondered if the AICC chief, who has no belief in constitutional bodies and authorities including the President, at least believed his own CM. “Is this why Siddaramaiah is contesting from two seats as he isn’t sure of his own governance compared to one of BJP state chief B S Yeddyruappa,” he asked.
