NEW DELHI: Leaders of the BJP-ruled   (SDMC) presented their report card on Sunday claiming their performance to be the "best" among the three civic bodies. 

 They also accused the AAP-led Delhi government of "harassing" the three municipal corporations in getting their dues cleared.
 
 In the run-up to the civic elections, the three municipal corporations ruled by the BJP are presenting their report cards including works done by them from 2012-2017.
 
 Highlighting their achievements in the past five years, the SDMC leader of the house Subhash Arya and chairman of standing committee Shailender Singh Monty enumerated the work done by the civic body in areas of health, education, street lighting, waste collection, flyovers and development of amusement park.
 
 They claimed though the three municipal corporations have performed well but the services of SDMC were the "best" as it had comparatively better financial resources at its disposal.
 
 A report card was presented a few days ago by leaders of NDMC and EDMC, also ruled by BJP.
