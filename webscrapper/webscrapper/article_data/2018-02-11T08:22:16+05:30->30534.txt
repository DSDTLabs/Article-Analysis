 "The service was to have started by the end of January but there were certain issues to be ironed out, like fuel. We have asked for all the two wheelers to be converted to CNG within six months, in line with other public   We are expecting the companies to apply for permits on Monday and start services within the next few days," said secretary of the   and regional transport officer of Lucknow, AK Singh.
 
 The companies will also be paying state taxes for just a year at present. Singh said the government would have charged tax for five years, which is the duration of the permit but a special concession has been made. "The companies said this is a new concept in Lucknow and they would need time to know whether this is even a profitable business model," said Singh.

Under state transport authority rules, the bike driver can carry one passenger at a time and will have to provide a helmet to the passenger. Bookings for the bike cabs will be made through the phone apps of the two companies.
