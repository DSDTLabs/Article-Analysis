CHARMINAR: Pothole riddled roads in the   could well be a thing of the past with the first “plastic“ road being laid late on Wednesday.
Officials of the  's (GHMC) south zone said that this road was laid in  .
 
 “The length of the road is around 300 metres. We chose that particular stretch because it is victim of water logging which has led to the formation of potholes,“ said Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation executive engineer (south zone)   even as he added that the project was taken up on “experimental basis“. “We will observe how the road functions and then go for laying plastic roads on other stretches, if successful,“ he added.
 
 He explained that fine pieces of plastic are mixed with bitumen which is why the name “plastic“ road has come about. “ Around 8 percent plastic is mixed before laying the road. This plastic melts and fills the gaps once the road is laid. This reduces chan ces of erosion due to water logging,“ Mohiuddin said.The laying of the road is marginally cost effective as it costs 1.4 percent less than a BT road, he added.
 
 The second round of road laying is relatively smaller at  . “ As of the moment the south zone has been given `40 lakh for plastic road laying. The estimated cost of laying the plastic-bitumen road at the Saidabad stretch was around `3 lakh,“ he said. “If this road means fewer potholes and tensile roads, then it is a welcome move. However, we will have to see if the GHMC's plans really work out,“ said S M Sadaat, a resident of Saidabad.
