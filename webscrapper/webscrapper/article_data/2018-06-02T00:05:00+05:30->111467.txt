The play 
  deals with the turbulent times of the then   when serfdom had been just abolished and the society was moving forward.

  Cherry orchard, as a metaphor, suggests several things simultaneously – the beauty of nature, memories of childhood and also the deep-rooted beliefs and worldviews of people. This complex and layered text is significant and relevant in different contexts and can be understood as a play with universal significance, beyond the barriers of time and space. For instance, it becomes relevant in our (India) context as well. Its relevance in the Indian context will be explored in this adaptation of Chekov’s

  Chekov wrote this play at a crucial juncture in the history of Russia. The changes in the global/world scenario had caused ripples in Russia’s socio-economic system. The effects of the industrial revolution were already visible in Russia around this time. The traditional, feudal system was being de-stabilised and a new capitalist order was taking the reins of Russian society. 
 
  In 1861, farmers who were being forced into bonded labour under Russia’s feudal system reaped the benefits of freedom with the demolition of the feudal order. While the rich began to lose their importance and position of authority and entered into an impoverished state, the poor began to acquire socio-economic importance in the society. These shifts have been powerfully narrated by Chekov in his play 
 .
