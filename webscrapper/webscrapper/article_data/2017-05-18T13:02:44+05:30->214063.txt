BIJNOR: In a massive crackdown on anti-social elements in Bijnor, the district police on Tuesday night arrested as many as 102 local criminals. Officials said that the growing agitation against law and order deterioration after the sensational Mathura double murder was the reason behind the drive and that DGP Sulkhan Singh personally gave instructions to   SP Atul Sharma in this regard.
 
  Several police teams led by SP Atul Sharma and ASP (rural)   carried out raids at multiple locations in the district and held 102 people. “We had clear orders from the DGP and ADG, Bareilly zone, to go ahead with a campaign targeting criminals,” ASP Dharamveer Singh said.
  
  While 68 of those arrested were none-bailable warrantees (people against whom court issues a non-bailable warrant for not appearing on multiple occasions), the reaming ones were those wanted in several criminal cases. “The arrested people have been sent to jail. We ran the campaign all night and will continue it until all criminals are nabbed,” added Dharamveer Singh.
  
  While police claimed that Tuesday night’s incident was a routine exercise, sources said that the drive has been launched in the entire Bareilly zone and it was intensified after the murder of two jewellers in Mathura on Monday evening. The cops are said to be under tremendous pressure to maintain law and order in the region.
  
  Jeweller Vikas Agarwal along with his acquaintance   was shot dead in a heist at his shop in Mathura on Monday night. A similar attack on a jeweler in Agra was reported the same night. The incidents sparked major protests against police and the state government. On Wednesday, the DGP was in Mathura to hold a review meeting on law and order situation in the district.
