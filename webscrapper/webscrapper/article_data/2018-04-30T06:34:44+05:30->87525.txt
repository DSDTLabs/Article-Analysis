MUMBAI: While the plastic ban has been announced only recently, a slow revolution has already been taking place at railway stations in the city. Around 100 water ATMs installed at suburban stations have ensured that nearly 2.5 lakh plastic bottles were not used a day. This shows how providing drinking water through taps may lessen the plastic burden.

 
 Water bottles have been spared from the ban till a sustainable eco-friendly solution is not introduced.   requires nearly 1 crore water bottles every day.
 
 “Around 100 water ATMs on suburban railway stations are providing 2 lakh litres of drinking water, negating the use of nearly 2.5 lakh water bottles every day,” said  , founder and CMD of JanaJal, an NGO that is helping  , the Indian Railway’s catering arm.   said they plan to install 1,000 such ATMs across the country by this year-end, taking the savings to over 25 lakh bottles a day. Each litre from the ATM costs Rs 5. “People have also benefited as the cost of ATM water is lower than bottled water. In view of the plastic ban, citizens have started carrying their own bottles, making water ATMs viable,” he added.
 
 The highest density of water ATMs is at stations in Mumbai region; some are in other parts of Maharashtra. The 100 ATMs are serving a commuter base of nearly 7 million passengers everyday.
 
 The 100 ATMs in Mumbai are manned by nearly 300 employees in three shifts. “Once we bring in an online system, we hope to raise the standard of distribution management,” said Agarwal.
 
 The bottled water market has grown from Rs 9,200 crore in 2015 to Rs 16,500 crore in 2018, which translates into use 15-20 crore bottles per day. The bottled water market is growing at 22% compounded annual growth rate, one of the highest growth rates in the industry.
