Chennai: Former executive vice chairman of Industrial Guidance Bureau in the state, M Velmurugan, is making a comeback to the same office -- that saw his abrupt exit in August 2016.

 “The first Global Investors Meet (GIM) was held on September 9 & 10, 2015 in which 98 MoUs were signed involving an investment of Rs 2.42 lakh crore. Therefore it is imperative that we should get investment commitment of similar magnitude in the forthcoming GIM as well. M Velmurugan who had served in Guidance Bureau for more than two decades and has been able to bring significant investment to our state. It is therefore proposed to utilize his services to focus on large investments into our state,” said a government order, issued by K Gnanadesikan, additional chief secretary and Industries secretary, Tamil Nadu government. The re-appointment has raised few questions in the industrial corridors as the existing executive vice chairman Shilpa Prabhakar’s role has been cut to Rs 100 crore or less as project investment while Velmurugan will handle bigger projects. Known to find “friends” across AIADMK and DMK regimes, he was at the state’s investment promotion arm for two decades before his abrupt exit—a tough feat.
 
 While the government is trumpeting GIM as success, only a fourth of the committed investments have been sunk in. “There were no issues pertaining to my services or when it came to an end with my retirement. Actually, after I migrated to the services of Tamil Nadu government, from Government of India, I had to adhere to the retirement age of 58 years and I actually retired in August, 2015, just before the first GIM. However, the government had then given me an extension of one year and that ended in August, 2016,” Velmurugan told TOI on Thursday. He is likely to take up his new position sometime next week.
