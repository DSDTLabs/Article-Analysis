 “The university is concerned about the students not getting through the examination at the same time, is also concerned about the quality of engineering students passing out. A committee is constituted to suggest measures to bring more transparency in the evaluation system,” a release issued by JNTU read. It, however, maintained that the system followed by the varsity is “fool proof”.Earlier on Monday, students of Ace Engineering College, CMR Engineering College and   held massive protests on their college campuses and shouted slogans of ‘we want justice’ demanding that the university amend the evaluation process and its existing norms. 
 
 Some students even submitted a representation to the JNTU vice-chancellor ruing how they failed in a subject despite answering all questions to properly. They also complained about the high re-evaluation fee. Students demanded that the university issue the notification for supplementary examination after the re-evaluation results. 
 
 On the students’ demands, the university clarified that issuing notification for supplementary exam after declaring re-evaluation results is a time-consuming process and may delay completion of various programmes offered by the varsity. “It is necessary to stick to the examination schedule in order to complete the programme in time. The re-evaluation process is time consuming. The regular examination notification cannot be delayed for want of cases of re-evaluation, keeping in view the interest of all the students of the university,” reads the statement. 
 
 Unsatisfied with university’s justification, a section of students have decided to go ahead with protest on Wednesday.
