JAIPUR: With the increasing   in the state, a   was taken by   (RTR) recently to expedite the procedure of providing   to villagers. The process which, in the past, took minimum of 29 days and maximum of 320 days, was resolved in barely 12 hours.

 On April 2, two cows were killed by a tiger in village Jogipura near Alanpur in RTR and a team was sent to assess the situation. Requisite documents were prepared by noon and cheques of Rs 10,000 for each cow as compensation was handed over to the owners of the cows by YK Sahu, field director and Marc Everard from Univesity of West England who has recently published a research paper on ‘Eco-system service enhancement for alleviation of wildlife-human conflicts in the Aravalli Hills Rajasthan, India’.
 
 Incidentally, this happened even when the forest department had not yet received funds from the government after March 31 for the financial year 2017-18. “Quick resolving of human-animal conflict is crucial for wildlife conservation especially when it comes to protecting tiger and leopard. It is an insurance against revenge killing of wild animals by antagonised villagers,” said Dharmendra Khandal from Tiger Watch NGO which chipped in the compensation amount.
 
 A study was carried out by NGO Tiger Watch about the time it took to disburse compensation for livestock killed by wild animals. There has been a marked improvement in timespan. In past few years, average time forest department took in disbursement of compensation was 30-40 days. The longest was 320 days in 2008-09.
 
 However, with decisions taken in February meeting, the park management is on a fast track. And this time, it happened quick on trot after cattle was killed.
 
 A decision was taken in the meeting by forest minister Gajendra Khimsar and additional chief secretary (forest) N C Goel for augmenting compensation rates and simplifying the procedure for disbursement to minimize human-animal conflict.
