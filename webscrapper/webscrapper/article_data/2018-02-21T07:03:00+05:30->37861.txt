Ludhiana: A retired Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer has written a letter to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh asking him to save Ludhiana from turning into a slum.

 Sarabha Nagar-based S S Chana,   who has served the Union forest ministry for several years, said, “Though Ludhiana has been proposed to be developed as a smart city, residents are really disappointed that the city instead of showing any improvement has further degenerated. Whatever grant was received from the Union government was wasted on non-essential works such as construction of welcome gates to smart city.”He had also sought an inquiry into a contract to construct 100 shops below the Southern Bypass flyover. He wrote, “Sarabha Nagar and BRS Nagar were developed purely as residential colonies. Any commercial activity in this area is against that concept.”
 
 “These shops in a narrow strip below the flyover will pose parking problem besides affecting the flow of traffic over the slip road.”
 
 Any accidental fire in any of the shops is likely to damage the flyover.
 
 The municipal corporation had earlier planned to landscape the canal strip within the city limits. Some NGOs had accordingly planted saplings along the canal bank that will be destroyed with the construction of shops.
 
 “A wide strip between the slip road and BRS Nagar from Ferozepur Road to the railway line may be landscaped to improve the ambience of the area. Funding for this work should not be difficult, provided the corporation makes sincere efforts to persuade some of the industrialists to use their CSR resources for this work,” Channa wrote.
