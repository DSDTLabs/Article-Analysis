MUMBAI: The Marathi Manoos backed Sena to the hilt, enabling the party to reclaim lost bastions in south central Mumbai. The congested belt of Parel-Sewri to Dadar Prabhadevi and Mahim-Shivaji Park--where a large section of voters are working class Maharashtrians--was wrested despite the BJP's pro-development pitch and the challenge posed by the MNS.

 In all, Sena bagged 22 of 35 seats spread over four administrative wards in the region, albeit losing some ground in Matunga, Sion and Dharavi, which mostly remain Congress strongholds.
 
 In Worli-Prabhadevi, Sena won six of seven seats and in  , it won seven of 11. Six of seven seats in F South (Naigaum-Parel-Lalbaug) and four in F North (Matunga-Sion-Pratiksha Nagar) too were bagged by the Sena. The area is where the party grew and represents the nucleus of its original support base.
 
 The resurgence of Sena in Maharashtrian enclaves has wiped MNS off the map in and around Dadar, where  's men had won seven wards in 2012. Sensing the implications of votes splitting between the rival Thackeray cousins, the community chose to consolidate behind the original Sena. “This year, for us, the fight was to save our culture. When the BJP was busy wooing Gujaratis, the Marathis had to come together,“ said Vithal Gokhale, a resident of Shivaji Park. Sena supporters said the rift between BJP and Sena played on the mind of the average voter.
 
 “After the Sena-BJP alliance broke, the election was being contested on the issue of Marathi sentiments and that is why there was heavy voting for   from this area,“ said a Ramesh Wagh.
 
 One of the most interesting contests was between MNS's Swapna Deshpande and Sena's Vishakha Raut. The fight ended in defeat for Deshpande, an ex-government employee and wife of sitting corporator Sandeep Deshpande, who quit her job to contest the elections.
