PATIALA: The municipal corporation here is all set to provide new spaces to street vendors. For this, the corporation has planned to hire consultants, who would guide and relocate them to new place so that they can run their businesses without impacting traffic movement. 

 As of now, the corporation has identified around 3,163 vendors in the city, who will be allotted new spaces after registration. The vending zones are being established by the corporation under the National Street Vending policy. The policy has been drafted as per the provisions of the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. The move will also put street vendors under the licencing policy of the corporation.
 
 The identified vendors will be issued identity cards after being listed as registered vendors with the   municipal corporation (PMC). The tenders that were floated by the   a few months ago to hire consultants will now open this week.
 
 The rationale behind the new vending zones is to provide vendors a permanent spot where they can run their business without creating any disturbance in the flow of traffic on roads and footpaths.
 
 The officials of the PMC started an anti-encroachment drive on Wednesday and removed street vendors from various parts of the city.
