AHMEDABAD: City police commissioner A K Singh has reassigned the   of the   of 72-year-old Nirmala Shah which was with the city crime branch. The investigation will now be done by local police, with the guidance of the local ACP and supervision of deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1, Bipin Ahire.

  Shah was bludgeoned to death at her bungalow in   on September 18, 2016. As the murder remained unsolved, it was transferred to the crime branch a fortnight after the event. According to top city police officials, Shah lived alone at the bungalow, while her sons Nayan and Kamal ran their pharma business from there. Shah’s body was found with multiple stab wounds in the neck and arms. She had been bludgeoned before being stabbed. “Four bangles that she wore and earrings were found to be missing. What puzzled investigators the most was a missing CPU and computer system. We questioned the gardener and several other suspects, but couldn’t get a breakthrough,” said a crime branch official.
 
 The murder of senior citizen in the posh   area of the city raised concerns about the security of elderly citizens who live alone. The city police are also likely to rope in IIM-A to study the factors affecting senior citizens and their safety. The city police sources said that city police commissioner A K Singh directed police officers of the rank of assistant commissioner of police to take up one dead (unsolved) murder case each and try to solve it. “A list of 12 undetected murder cases has been made. Every ACP in the city will form a team led by the local police inspector and supervise the case,” said a top city police official.
 
 Crime branch is also probing the murder of builder Hanif Shaikh and the murder of 10-year-old-boy in Gomtipur. City police’s premier investigating agency has not found any leads in either case.
