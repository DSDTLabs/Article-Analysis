LUCKNOW: The district administration has ordered food safety and drug administration ( ) to take samples from 'bhandaras' organised during Bada Mangal celebrations across the city for testing to find out whether they follow safety norms. The administration has also circulated the food safety norms among temples, requesting them to spread awareness about it among devotees, particularly those who are organizing bhandaras. 

 Officials said that around 1,000 stalls are expected to be set up across the city on Bada Mangal on Tuesday. The figure is based on the request letters seeking permission of loudspeakers received by the administration. District food officer TR Rawat said FSDA has circulated norms prescribed in the food safety act among temples to prevent preparation of substandard food in 'bhandaras'.
 
 Also, administration has coordinated with different temple committees in order to organise things peacefully as it would be the first time when FSDA would take samples from all stalls on Bada Mangal across the city. The sampling would be done during distribution. As per FSDA, the test result of the samples collected on Bada Mangal is expected to be received within eight days after which action would be taken. This year, there would be nine Bada Mangals falling in months of May and June.
