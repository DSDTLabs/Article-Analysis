CHENNAI: Around 100 AIADMK   continued to ‘holiday’ in a luxurious resort at Koovathur near Mahabalipuram for the sixth consecutive day even as   witnessed hectic political activity with chief minister O Panneerselvam daring party general secretary V K   to set them free. 

 Sources said MLAs loyal to Sasikala were given complete freedom to move around. A few of them even went out of the resort to visit their family members, who reached a location near the resort. A few MLAs were permitted to invite their family members for a brief stay in the resort.
 
 Sasikala is expected to visit the MLAs for the third consecutive day on Monday. Police, who had negligible presence until Sunday afternoon, have strengthened its vigil to prevent any untoward incidents. Journalists covering the developments staged an agitation on Sunday for preventing them from entering the resort for the fourth consecutive day.
 
 Meanwhile, police revenue officials, who conducted an inquiry with the MLAs following habeas corpus petitions in the Madras high court, submitted a report along with written statements of the MLAs with their signatures.
