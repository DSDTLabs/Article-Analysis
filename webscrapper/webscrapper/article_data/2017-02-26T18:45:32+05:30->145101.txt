Sporting a white pantsuit and a "resist" armband,   gave the first major political performance of the 2017 Grammys Sunday night while doing her song ' '. A major supporter of Hillary Clinton during the presidential election, Perry's performance of her new song that she released on Friday was certainly a message that she will continue to be a major voice on issues she believes in. And it made her stand on President  's administration pretty clear.

 Her Grammy performance ended with her sharing the stage with Skip Marley, who is featured on the track, and a graphic of the Constitution's words behind them.
 
 Perry's final words before ending the song were "No hate." 
 
 'Chained to the Rhythm' has Perry's most explicitly political lyrics to date. The singer says, "So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble / So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble."
 
 Marley's verse on the song is even more bold in its political take, saying "We're about to riot."
