BHUBANESWAR: Even as the commissionerate police continued to grope in dark about the whereabouts of missing Kashmiri medical student of AIIMS-Bhubaneswar,  , a hand-written poster surfaced on Monday, claiming that he was kidnapped by Maoists. Police seized the poster, pasted on wall of Baramunda bus stand, about 3 km from AIIMS-Bhubaneswar.

 "We (Maoists) have kidnapped Suhail. Release our leader   and take back Suhail. Else, be prepared for any eventuality," read the content of the poster, written in Odia. As the letter sent the police into tizzy, Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda's wife Subhashree, aka Mili said the poster was a prank. 
 
 "I am sure somebody tried to play mischief. By naming by husband, someone tries to mislead the police," Mili told media persons here. Top Maoist leader Sabyasachi was arrested by police in July 2014. He is still cooling his heels in judicial custody. 
 
 Police said they are verifying the authenticity of the contents of the poster. "We have taken serious note of it. All efforts are being made to trace Suhail," said DCP Satyabrata Bhoi. Suhail went missing from   here on February 9. Signal of Suhailâ€™s mobile phone was traced to Howrah on February 10, police said. Police here roped in their counterparts in J&K and   to locate Suhail.
