THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As a 14-year-old boy, it was this possibility of the existence of other worlds that attracted   to the concept of astral projection 15 years ago. He came across it while surfing the web, instantly got hooked and explored the web for more information.

 For believers in occultism, astral projection is a technique of separating one's soul from the physical body. Once separated from the body, the soul or the spirit will have the power to transcend the boundaries of the worlds.
 
 Cadell, now 29-years-old, told the police that he soon 'mastered' astral projection from the information he accessed on internet and started practising it regularly. As per his statement, while performing astral projection, he gains the strength of multiple persons. His physical body is unaware of the things happening around him.
 
 The habit soon affected his character. Despite being the son of academically brilliant parents,   botched up his studies. He would spend hours and even days inside his room, performing astral projection. He dropped out of his studies while in Class XII.
 
 Though he went to   to learn animation, he abandoned studies and returned home. However, he spread a lie that he had landed a job with an Australian firm so that he could work from home via online. But, this was just a ploy to stay inside his room without being questioned Â­ a fact that even his close relatives did not know.
 
 He also told the police that he does not know why he murdered his family members.
 
 However, the police have not bought his story completely.The cops have employed the service of Dr G  , consultant psychiatrist,  , to gain insights from Cadell's mind.Mohan Roy could not be contacted for this story as the session continued late into night.
