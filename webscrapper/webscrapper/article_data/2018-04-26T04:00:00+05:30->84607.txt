Ahmedabad: It was in July 2008 that bodies to two minors- Dipesh and his cousin Abhishek Vaghela, studying in the Ashram School, were found from the Sabarmati riverbed located Asaram’s ashram in Motera. Since then parents of the ill-fated children are demanding a CBI probe in the deaths.

 Talking to TOI, Shantilal Vaghela father Abhishek lamented the fact that the report of DK Trivedi Inquiry Commission was not made public by the government. “I still have strong suspicion that both the brothers were murdered brutally using black magic. Since Gujarat police in incompetent to solve the mystery of the case I will continue to demand CBI investigation in their death,” said Vaghela.
 
 He said since the death of his son he has been longing to see the perpetrators of the crime being punished for the heinous crime. “We lost everything. We were promised by state government that the accused will be brought to books but nothing has happened even after ten years,” Shantilal added.
 
 Dipesh and Abhishek had been missing from Ahsram School three days before their bodies were found about a kilometre away from the Ashram in Motera. The incident had raised a huge outrage among the people who had come out on streets in protest.
