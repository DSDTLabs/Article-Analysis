NEW DELHI: Two years after renewing his “active” membership of the party from a village near Bhubaneshwar, returns to the city to script expansion plans in east India and the Coromandel coast region at the forthcoming national executive scheduled for April 14-16. Shah had renewed his active membership, as is required every three years, from Dhauli near Bhubaneshwar on January 7, 2015.

 The three-day meet at Janata Maidan, Bhubaneshwar, comes at a crucial juncture as the NDA government completes three years of its term next month and gets ready to contest several state polls including those of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh before the 2019 general elections.
 
 “Our agenda is to groom workers in all 32,000 booths in Odisha and party’s performance in the state will lay the foundation for expansion,” said petroleum minister  , seen as a prominent face of the party in the coastal state. After finishing second to ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in the recent panchayat polls,   pundits claim that the meet will develop much needed momentum for the assembly polls.
 
 As the PM has laid emphasis on development plans in east India which he has said needs to catch up with the west, Bhubaneshwar is seen as the gateway to a region where BJP has not commanded a major presence.
 
 States like West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are focus area for the party as Shah has seem them as possible contributors to the BJP tally in 2019.
 
 Pradhan said the party has high hopes from Odisha, which he said remains a backward area bereft of development and said people see a ray of hope in the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
