LUCKNOW:   stalled the proceedings in both House on Monday in protest against the reported statement of   terming  ,   and terrorism and demanded an apology from him.

 Vidhan Sabha witnessed heated exchanges between opposition and treasury benches when Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary said that the CM had no right to accuse SP of nepotism when he himself was not clean. Chaudhary said that Yogi took the mantle of his guru Mahant Avaidhnath, who followed the footsteps of his Guru Mahant Digvijaynath, and also contested elections.
 
 Later, talking to mediapersons in the Central Hall, Chaudhary said, “Why Gorakhpur Lok Sabha elections were contested only by people from temple? Why no other candidate was allowed to contest? Is this not nepotism?,” Chaudhary quipped. When
 
 BJP members protested against Chaudhary’s statement, SP members trooped into the well of the House raising slogans against the CM and government.
 
 Talking to mediapersons later, parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna said that Chaudhary doesn’t know the difference between ‘Gurushishya parampara’ (teacherdisciple tradition) and family lineage. After question hour, Chaudhary again raised the issue through special mention under rule 110 of the House citing media reports about CM’s statement at a public meeting. But the notice was rejected as Khanna said that the House does not take cognizance of media reports.
 
 When SP members continued protest, Speaker first adjourned the House for 15 minutes, then extended it by 20 minutes and then 45 minutes before adjourning it for the day. Khanna said that SP members don’t want the House to function.
 
 SP legislators protested in the Vidhan Parishad also on the issue. Demanding apology from CM, SP members stormed into the well raising slogans forcing the chairman to adjourn the House for the day.
