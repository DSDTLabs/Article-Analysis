NEW DELHI:  , from this academic session, will allow online counselling for 10 undergraduate and possibly all post graduate courses. The decision came after the final submission made by the sub-committee, formed to look into the concern, was approved on Friday. 

 DU plans to develop a software that would allow applicants to select 10 colleges on the basis of their cut-offs and other preferences based on which they would be directed to the colleges they can apply to. 
 
 While announcing details of this year's process, the admissions committee said the university was trying to shorten the "prolonged admissions process often caused by unrealistic cut-offs". It had therefore, formed a sub-committee to "formulate a policy on online counselling", which submitted its report on Friday.
 
  "We have suggested that DU can conduct online counselling for 10 courses, including bachelor courses in management studies, business administration, business economics and music. This will be on a pilot basis, and if successful, we will take it forward next year as a full-fledged system," a member of the sub-committee said. The software would help save applicants time, as a lot of times students are unsure of their choices and have to run from one college to another, the member added.
