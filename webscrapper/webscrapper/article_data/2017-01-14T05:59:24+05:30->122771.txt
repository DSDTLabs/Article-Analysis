PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   remains positive about forming an alliance with the   for the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal elections.

 A final decision on the matter will be taken by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray by January 20, said party leaders on Friday.
 
 Members of Parliament Shrirang Barne (Maval) and Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil (Shirur) said their party is constantly holding talks with the BJP. One such meeting was held on Friday, and was attended by senior BJP leaders, including city unit president Laxman Jagtap, Bhosari MLA Mahesh Landge and former mayor Azam Pansare. From the Shiv Sena, Pimpri MLA Gautam Chabukswar and city unit president Rahul Kalate were among those present.
 
 Another round of talks will be held in a couple of days. 
 
 “There was an alliance between the Shiv Sena and BJP, and we would like it to continue in this elections as well,” said Barne. “We are hopeful (about the alliance). Only (with an alliance) will we be able to topple the ruling NCP, which is facing numerous allegations of corruption and irregularities in development works implemented by the municipal corporation,” he added.
 
 In the last elections, the BJP had won just three seats while the Sena won 14. When asked about a seat-sharing formula, Barne said seats will be shared equally. 
 
 “The winnability of candidates is important,” said Patil. “Both parties have carried out surveys which said the ruling NCP can be defeated only through an alliance. We will nominate candidates depending on the ground reality. If the alliance does form, there will be a common manifesto for Pimpri Chinchwad,” Patil added. 
 
 The Shiv Sena will submit its first list of candidates by January 25.
 
 Meanwhile, Uddhav Thackeray and Sena leader   will address election rallies in Pimpri Chinchwad in the first week of February.
