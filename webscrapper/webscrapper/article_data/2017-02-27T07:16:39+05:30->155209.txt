NEW DELHI: Hundreds of   gathered at Jantar Mantar on Sunday to protest against the delay in their resettlement.

 In 2009, around 1,500 families were asked to shift to a transit camp as   planned its in-situ development by building multistorey flats.
 
 The shifting started in 2014 but was slow because all residents were not convinced about this promise. Although the shifting has started, the work to construct the houses has not begun as the colony is yet to be fully vacated.
 
 Vijay Kumar, a resident, said some NGOs were discouraging people from shifting. "The protest is also against the NGOs that have vested interests. Because of the ir interference, the project has been delayed. The transit camp is also not in good condition," he said.
 
 "We were convinced that we would be given flats, so we moved to the transit camp at Anand Parbat. We were promised that we would get our houses in two years but not a single house is ready ," said Subedar Barga, who stays in the camp.
 
 Kathputli Residents Welfare Association is now pushing for its demands. Shravan Bhatt, who led the protesters, said the government should take action against anybody asking residents not to move out of the slum.They also sent a memorandum to urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu seeking his intervention.
 
 The residents of Kathputli Colony, from several states, are traditional artists.
