Historian   said the biggest mistake   is making in Kashmir is not  . 

 When J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti came to New Delhi after  , the PM didn’t meet her. Given that Mufti is in an alliance with the BJP in J&K, it is even more shocking, Guha said.
 
  When a high-profile BJP delegation led by Yashwant Sinha went to Kashmir to talk to all the constituents, including separatists, and came back with their findings,
 Modi didn’t meet his partymen. This sends wrong signals to the Kashmiris, Guha said at the launch of the 10th anniversary edition of his book,  , at the Alliance Francaise on Friday.
