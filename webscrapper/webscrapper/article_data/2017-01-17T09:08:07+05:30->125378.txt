PONDA: Perhaps for the first time, banners have come up in Nirankal ward of the   constituency asking its MLA and industries minister   not to enter their homes for canvassing. The banner also warns local panch member Chandrakant Samant.

 Locals said they had elected Naik for last two terms—in 2007 and 2012—as he had promised development. But despite being a minister, he had failed to fulfill his promise, they said.
 
 Sunil Sawkar, former panch member of Borim, said the   had come up with a 25-point development agenda for   but except for construction of the Karai primary health centre, other works were either incomplete or not started. Even the promise of developing Siddhanath hills as a tourist destination remained on paper, he said. Soon after banners came up at Nirankal, BJP’s Shiroda unit circulated a picture on social media showing locals were with Naik.
