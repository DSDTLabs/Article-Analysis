MOHALI: Refuting all the allegations against him,   Kulwant Singh said he is not corrupt and will move court for defamation against the person who has signed the orders of his suspension or issuance of   notice on charges of gross misconduct of powers and causing loss to state exchequer.

 Kulwant Singh said terming everyone as “corrupt” is not good politics. “You should not think others to be corrupt if you are honest,” said Kulwant. He also said that the allegations raised against him must be proved first. He said, “There is no space for lust of money in my life. By God’s grace, I am wealthy enough to earn meager chunk of money out of MC funds. Terming a person like me to be a corrupt man is actually political vendetta to malign my image. I will move to the court for defamation against the person who has signed the orders for the showcause notice.”
 
 First   mayor   said the notice has dented his image as local government minister, Punjab. Navjot Singh Sidhu in a press statement had said that it had come to the notice of the department that mayor of municipal corporation, Mohali Kulwant Singh in connivance with the then municiapl commissioner Rajesh Dhiman and other officials indulged in blatant misuse of his position and caused a loss of grave nature to the state exchequer while making a purchase of a tree pruning machine at hiked price.
