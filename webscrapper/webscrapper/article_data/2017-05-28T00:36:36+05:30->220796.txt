THANE: A   loaded with iron rods rammed onto a divider near   flyover in the wee hours of Saturday morning. A major accident was averted as the accident took place at around 4 am, when there was hardly any traffic movement on this otherwise busy stretch. 

 According to AS Mangale, traffic police inspector at Teen Hath Naka, “The driver was cruising at a very high speed, breaching all traffic rules, on the Nashik-Mumbai Highway and was heading towards Mumbai. Perhaps he lost control of the vehicle and that caused the trolley to veer off the roadway. The unidentified driver fled from the spot before the arrival of the officials. Fortunately no one was injured in the accident.”
 
 It took the city traffic department close to two hours to resolve the traffic in the area and for the situation to return to normal. “We are going to file a complaint against the driver with Naupada police station for rash and negligent driving,” added Mangale.
