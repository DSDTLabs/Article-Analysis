COIMBATORE: Chief minister   on Saturday called for a reunion of the warring factions of the party to implement the schemes initiated by former CM  . “Those who have deviated from the path should return. I appeal for unity to execute the schemes conceived by MGR and Jayalalithaa,” he told a party gathering in Mettupalayam. Palaniswami’s statement comes close on the heels of rebel leader   meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Friday. 

 Palaniswami said leaders of the other faction should remind themselves that they had risen in ranks only due to Jayalalithaa. “People cast their votes only for Amma. The state government will have to complete its full term,” he said. This is the second statement from Palaniswami after he invited OPS faction for merger talks early this month in Chennai. The talks remain a non-starter despite the two sides setting up seven-member committees for negotiation. 
 
 Palaniswami sought to convey to the rival group that they should fulfil the promises made to voters. “They should work with the government,” the CM said, hinting at local MLA O K Chinnaraj, who switched loyalty to OPS. The Palaniswami government won a trust vote by a margin of 122-11 in the 234 member assembly in February after the opposition was ousted from the Assembly. The OPS faction has 11 MLAs, including former ministers S Semmalai and K Pandiarajan. 
 
 The leaders of the factions have been talking tough, with Semmalai and his supporters passing a resolution in Salem accusing Palaniswami and his faction of orchestrating the merger plan as per the orders of   family. However, Palaniswami clarified on Saturday that the party was founded only to fight against family politics. “A few worked actively to topple the government and divide the party. But their wishes remain a day dream,” he said.
