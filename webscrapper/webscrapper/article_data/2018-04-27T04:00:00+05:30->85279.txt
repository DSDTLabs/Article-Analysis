Rajkot: Now, Rajkot citizens will have to shell out twice as much for enjoying the rides at Fun World on Racecourse ground. 

 Not only has the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) allowed the contractor to double the entry fee, but it has also given the nod for 100% hike in charges of every ride. The entry fee for adults has been revised to Rs 20 from Rs 10 and for children below 12 years to Rs 15 from Rs 8. 
 
 Fun World is one of the favourite hangout places for children during the summer vacation. The RMC standing committee approved the rise in the fee structure saying that this was the first price hike after 11 years. However, the opposition protested the decision of the standing committee terming 100% hike as unreasonable. tnn
