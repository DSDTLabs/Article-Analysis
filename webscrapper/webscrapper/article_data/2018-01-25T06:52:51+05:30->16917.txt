NEW DELHI: The probe into the  , which killed 17 people on Saturday, has revealed that its owner, Manoj Jain, was working in tandem with Lalit Goyal, who used to illegally procure combustible and explosive substances from Hathras, UP. 

 Jain allegedly made the disclosure before the police, which, on Wednesday, sought five more days of his custody to arrest Goyal as well as find the source of the material used to manufacture firecrackers.
 
 After metropolitan magistrate Jitendra Pratap Singh extended Jain’s custody by three days, the investigating officer (IO) said that due to the security arrangements on Republic Day, it would be difficult to produce him in court on January 27. 
 
 Defence counsel Pradeep Rana and Rishi Pal Singh also submitted that Jain was ready to cooperate in the interrogation for five days but would like his lawyers to be present during the questioning. Jain was then sent to   for five days. 
 
 “This court directs that when he (Jain) is in Delhi and he demands seeing his lawyer, the IO shall inform his counsel and he shall be provided the opportunity so that the same is made available,” the metropolitan magistrate said.
