NAGPUR: Consumer activist Pratap Hogade has alleged that the   in the state off late are completely unwarranted and illegal. 

 Hogade, who is the executive president of Maharashtra Veej Grahak Sangathana (MVGS), claimed that the power cuts were due to complete lack of planning by  , Mahagenco and the state government. He has decided to file a petition before   ( ) and seek action against the discom.
 
 Hogade said that as per the petition submitted by MSEDCL before MERC, the discom’s current availability was 33,500MW. “As per MSEDCL it has 9,000MW surplus power. Due to lack of demand, several power projects are not generating and consumers are paying the capacity charges. MSEDCL had demanded Rs4,000 crore from consumers on this count,” he said.
 
 The activist further said that MERC, in its tariff order issued in November 2016, determined the excess availability to be in the range of 6,000MW to 6,500MW. “The Commission has allowed MSEDCL to recover Rs3,000 crore as capacity charges from consumers in three years,” he added.
 
 “While the availability was 33,500MW, the peak demand was 19,000MW. How can MSEDCL face a shortfall of 4,000MW,” Hogade said.
 
 The activist slammed Mahagenco for improper management of   water. “Water should be conserved till June 20. However, the officials consumed most of the water in winter and now the project can’t generate at full capacity,” he said.
 
 According to Hogade, resorting to power cuts when consumers were paying capacity charges did not make any sense. “The closed down units should be immediately started and load shedding should be stopped.
