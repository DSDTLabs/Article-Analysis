Nagpur: Six of every ten water consumers of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) are defaulters. As per the data, about 1,93,703 of total 3,21,853 are defaulters and owe arrears to the tune of Rs 176.76 crore.  Apart from this, the civic body is suffering economically with the increase in the arrears of water bills after it handed water works over to private operator Orange City Water Private Limited (OCW). However, the ramped up arrears are also due to the amnesty scheme launched last year. The NMC has organized second round of amnesty scheme for water bills defaulters between July 17 and August 7. Last year, the scheme was organized between June 16 and June 30. The scheme had covered only residential and slum consumers last year with arrears of above Rs 2,000. Continuing with the scheme, the NMC will give benefits to all types of consumers irrespective of the amount. The civic body, with the help of OCW, has prepared a category-wise data of defaulters and arrears to be collected. Now, the amount of the arrears has surpassed revenue. Revenue recorded in 2016-17 from water works was below Rs 125 crore while the arrears are Rs 176.76 crore. Most of the defaulters belong to residential category (1,29,115) and owe arrears of Rs 90.73 crore.  This is followed by slum (non-slab) 44,902 with arrears of Rs 9.56 crore while the slum defaulters (slab category) are 13,848 with arrears of Rs 3.36 crore. Though the number of defaulters under commercial category is very low, the arrears amount is huge. As per the record, about 3,048 commercial consumers under three different sub-categories owe arrears to the tune of Rs 51.48 crore. Besides, two sub-categories of industrial consumers comprise about 2,790 defaulters, who owe arrears to the tune of Rs 21.59 crore. The ratcheted up arrears also raises a question on the performance of OCW. According to records, the water bill arrears were Rs 79.33 crore in 2011-12. However, the arrears have so far seen over two-fold increase after the NMC handed water works over to OCW in March 2012. Apparently, the amnesty scheme launched last year has not worked as expected. This is quite evident from the fact that the number of defaulters has only increased ever since the scheme was launched. Records show that before commencement of the amnesty scheme, number of defaulters were 54,700 who owe arrears of Rs 100.81 core.  As many as 19,699 availed benefit of the scheme to pay arrears while there was no payment from 35,001 defaulters. Currently, there are 64,597 defaulters under residential and slum categories with arrears of above Rs 2,000. The NMC will waive off interest/penalty amount from the water bills if defaulters pay the water bills under amnesty scheme.  General body had made it very clear that the amnesty scheme will not be facilitated again in current regime up to 2022. Moreover, an amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters will also be launched. Interest/penalty of 90% will be waived off for property tax defaulters.
