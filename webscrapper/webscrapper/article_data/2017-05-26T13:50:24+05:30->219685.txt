HYDERABAD: Apart from Prime Minister   and BJP president  , the   will be roping in   chief minister   to   in the run up to the 2019 elections. This was stated by state BJP president K Laxman at a press conference here on Thursday. 

 "The TRS is shivering after the visit of one leader, our party president Amit Shah. What will happen to it when three leaders campaign in Telangana?" he asked as he named the other two leaders as Modi and Adityanath. "Shah will visit Telangana again for 6 days in September this year. After that, UP CM Adityanath as well as PM Modi will visit Telangana," Laxman told TOI.
 
 Adityanath has emerged as the biggest crowd puller for the BJP after Modi. After having seen his magic work in UP, where the BJP won an unprecedented majority, the party wants him to sway Telangana electorate. "Like Modi and Shah, Adityanath will speak only in Hindi but we expect him to have an impact in Telangana," said a party sources, adding that he can influence the large Yadav population in the state.
 
 The BJP at present has 5 assembly seats in Telangana. Party sources said the aim is to increase it to at least 20 in the next polls. And for that they are banking on national leaders including Adityanath. Assembly elections are slated in Andhra Pradesh as well in 2019, but it is not clear as yet if the UP CM would visit it. "Our aim is to ensure that Adityanath campaigns in the two Telugu states but at present we can confirm only his visit to Telangana," said a source.
