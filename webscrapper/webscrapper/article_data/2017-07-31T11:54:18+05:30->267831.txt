PATNA: Deputy CM   on Sunday said the government would look into the burgeoning problem of amassing wealth through illegal means and devise ways to tackle it.

 Addressing mediapersons after the newly inducted BJP ministers in the   government and the party’s other functionaries listened to the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme of PM  , the deputy CM said the state would make progress in developmental activities under the new NDA government, as it is for the first time in several decades that there is a same government at both the Centre and the state.
 
 Among those present on the occasion at the state BJP headquarters were ministers Nand Kishore Yadav, Prem Kumar and Mangal Pandey, as well as the party’s state president Nityanand Rai and general secretary (organisation) Nagendraji.
 
 Later, at a separate function held to formalise the entry of former RJD state general secretary Sanoj Yadav into the BJP, Rai said Sanoj was one of the several political functionaries of the Yadav caste who had been insulted either by RJD national president Lalu Prasad or his son Tej Pratap Yadav, former minister.
 
 Rai recalled the names of such political bigwigs from the Yadav caste, such as Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav, Buddhadeo Singh Yadav, Anup Lal Yadav, Gajendra Prasad Himanshu, Hukumdeo Narayan Yadav, and also present Union minister Ram Kripal Yadav, who was present at the function.
 
 Rai said people of the Yadav caste had reposed faith in Lalu, but he only used it to increase the wealth of his own family. “Besides, Lalu also used the massive support that the people of this caste gave him to politically establish his family members,” Rai added.
