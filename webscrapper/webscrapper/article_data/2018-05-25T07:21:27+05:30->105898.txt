UDUPI: Udupi district is on high alert over the   scare since lakhs of devotees, a huge majority of them from  , visit the   temple in  . KMC Manipal has installed cautionary messages on their premises and has asked patients who have recently visited the health care facility in Calicut and neighbouring areas of Kerala, to immediately visit the special help desk in the hospital.

 The temple authorities have been blissfully unaware of the danger posed by the virus and have not put preventive measures in place.
 
 
 “We read about the virus in the newspapers, but no action has been taken by the district health officials,” said Krihnamootrthi, AEO of the temple. “We cannot prevent devotees entering the temple. We are more concerned about ensuring devotees have the best facilities in terms of food, water, prasadham and hygiene on the premises. About 15,000 devotees visit Kollur every day and about 90% are from Kerala.”
 
 Rohini, district health officer, said, "We cannot stop people from other districts from entering the temple. There have been no cases of Nipah reported in the district as yet. The disease spreads only when it is in the extreme stage (respiratory distress) and people in that condition generally don’t travel so the chances of it spreading in temples or tourist spots are remote.”
