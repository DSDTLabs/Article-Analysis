AHMEDABAD: Setting a precedent, Gujarat high court has ruled that a bank account holder or principal cannot be prosecuted in cases of cheque bounce, if the authorized signatory or the power-of-attorney holder has issued the cheque.

 By arriving at the conclusion, Justice J B Pardiwala has taken a view contrary to those earlier taken by various high courts of the country.
 
 The instant case pertained to a proprietorship firm,  , and its proprietor Sushila Bhatiya. She had borrowed Rs 5 lakh from an acquaintance,  . To return the amount, Bhatiya’s son Pulkit, as her PoA, issued cheques to Desai, which were dishonoured on the ground that the bank account was closed. Desai sued the firm and Bhatiya under Negotiable Instrument Act at the metropolitan court in 2014.
 
 As the prosecution against Bhatiya began, she moved the HC arguing that her son signed and issued the cheques a couple of months after she had cancelled his PoA.
 
  quashed the proceeding against Bhatiya and her firm with the observation that the principal is not liable for dishonour of the cheque under Section 138 of NI Act, and only the mandate holder, who has drawn the cheque, can be held liable. The HC has concluded that the principal, being the proprietor, cannot be held vicariously liable for the cheque signed by her authorized signatory.
 
 Justice Pardiwala cited a   order that says that only the drawer of the cheque can be prosecuted. He quoted Iyer’s Judicial Dictionary and Black’s Law Dictionary to explain the meaning of drawer and maker of a bill of exchange or cheque. “It is only the drawer of the cheque who can be held liable for an offence under Section 138 of NI Act. If that be so, the PoA holder, who ordered payment and signed the cheque, is primarily held liable if there is not sufficient fund in the account,” the HC observed.
 
 The HC also observed that there is no provision in law that enables the court to prosecute the principal for an offence committed by his/her PoA.
