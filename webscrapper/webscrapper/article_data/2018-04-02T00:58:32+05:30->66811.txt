New Delhi: A-17-year-old girl allegedly committed suicide after failing her   examination in northeast Delhi’s Harsh Vihar on Sunday morning. No suicide note was recovered from her possession.

 The victim, Asha, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in her room by her parents. A day before, Asha had gone to her school to collect her result, in which she had reportedly failed. 
 
 Asha’s parents told cops that after returning from school, she was under depression and didn’t eat. “She didn’t talk to anyone about the result and went early to her room to sleep,” said a family member.
 
 The next day, family members broke open the door of Asha’s room after she didn’t respond to their calls to come down for breakfast. They found her hanging from the ceiling fan with a chunni tied around her neck. She was taken to a nearby hospital but was declared brought dead. Cops were informed about the incident following which an inquest under section 174 of the CrPC was initiated for further probe.
