NAGPUR: In a welcome development, city power franchisee   has cleared the entire dues of state discom MSEDCL. This has happened for the first time in seven years of the franchisee’s existence.

 Interestingly, MSEDCL has floated tenders for appointing franchisees in three urban areas — Akola, Malegaon and Mumbra-Shil-Kalwa. Three more tenders area in the pipeline.
 
 Sources in MSEDCL said SNDL had dues worth Rs57 crore in January end. “SNDL’s parent company Essel Utilities made a payment of Rs60 crore. Now, only the current bill of Rs30 crore regarding first week of February has to be paid. There is time for that,” an official said.
 
 SNDL and other power franchisees buy power from MSEDCL at a bulk rate and then sell it to consumers. Ideally, the franchisees should pay for power purchased every week but this rarely happens. MSEDCL also did not take action against the franchisees beyond issuing routine show-cause notices.
 
 This leniency has cost MSEDCL dearly. Aurangabad franchisee GTL’s contract was terminated when its dues mounted to Rs150 crore. Instead of paying up, GTL asked the discom to recover the amount by collecting pending bills of consumers.
 
  franchisee   had to be ousted when its dues crossed Rs100 crore. Crompton also asked MSEDCL to recover the amount from consumers and adjust the rest against the investment done by it in augmenting the power infrastructure of franchisee area.
 
 The discom was even more lenient with SNDL, its past owner Spanco and its current owner Essel. MSEDCL waited for Spanco’s dues to cross Rs200 crore when it asked Essel to pay off the amount and take over SNDL.
 
 After a few months, Essel too emulated Spanco’s behaviour and within no time its dues crossed Rs100 crore. This time however, MSEDCL asked it to open an escrow account and double the bank guarantee (BG). It is only now that SNDL has no dues.
