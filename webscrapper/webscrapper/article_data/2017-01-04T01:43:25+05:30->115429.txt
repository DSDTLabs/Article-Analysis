NEW DELHI: A middle-aged man was arrested after an   air hostess complained that he had allegedly misbehaved with her on a flight coming to Delhi from Muscat.

 The flight, AI 974, had just entered the Indian airspace early Tuesday when the air hostess informed the captain that a passenger had “touched her inappropriately” and “repeatedly” used lewd language.
 
 “The commander used the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system, a digital data link for transmitting short messages between the aircraft and the ground stations, to inform the airlines about the alleged   harassment. He also asked for security personnel at the arrival gate so that the man could be arrested at the earliest,” said a source.
 
 The man was apprehended and later handed over to security agencies. “We will not tolerate indecent behaviour with our women crew members. Our pilots have been instructed to take strict action in such cases,” said a senior AI official.
 
 International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reported a worrying rise in unruly flyers globally. According to its latest data, airlines across the world reported 10,854 cases of unruly passenger incidents in flights in 2015. “This equates to one incident for every 1,205 flights, an increase from the 9,316 incidents reported in 2014 (or one incident for every 1,282 flights),” an IATA statement said.
 
 Most of the incidents involved verbal abuse, failure to follow crew instructions and other forms of antisocial behaviour. “A significant proportion (11%) of reports indicated physical aggression towards passengers or crew and damage to the aircraft. Alcohol or drug intoxication was a factor in 23% of the cases, though in most cases these were consumed before boarding or without the knowledge of the crew,” it added.
