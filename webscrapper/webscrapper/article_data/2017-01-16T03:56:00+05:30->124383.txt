Nagpur: ‘Hasya kavi sammelan’, organized by the Nagpur branch of Indian Medical Association had the audience in splits at IMA’S JR Shaw Auditorium, North Ambazari Road on Sunday. 

 Five well known poets from across India performed at the programme. Poems presented by Pradeep Choubey (Mumbai), Bansidhar Mishra (Chhattisgarh), Arvind Bhonde (Akola), Anand Raj Anand (Hyderabad) and Bharat Tripathi (Gwalior) drew repeated applause and laughter.
 
 Choubey teasingly spoke of people in our society. One of his poems read, “Sali ne jija se kaha ke mein pass hogai. Jijaji muskurake bole thodi aur pass hojao” that evoked tremendous laughter. In another of his poem, Choubey says, ‘Jab bhagwan insan se naraz hota hai to wo use doctor ke pass bhejta hai aur jab doctor insan se naraz hota hai to wo use bhagwan ke pass bhejta hai’. Tripathi’s poems talked about love stories of today’s generations and views of youth on love. Bhonde was the only poet who performed in Marathi and his jokes were praised by the audience very much. 
 
 Shabana Khan was the anchor at the event. Many doctors associated with IMA participated in the programme. Dr Archana Kothari, secretary of IMA, Dr Vaishali Khandait, Dr RJ Malani and others were present.
