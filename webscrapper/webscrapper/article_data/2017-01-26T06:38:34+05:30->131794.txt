HYDERABAD: Searching for a   angle in the Rs 100 crore   shown by the   shop owners on the demonetisation night of November 8, the   (ED) is now hoping to get some vital information through questioning some accused in the case.

 The police who registered the case following a complaint from the income tax department have already arrested Musadilal's managing director Kailash Chand Gupta. Apparently, the authorities could not get much information from him. The ED is now waiting to question his sons Nikhil Gupta and Nitin Gupta and few others of the jewellery firm. Within a few hours after the centre announced its demonetisation move on the night of Nov 8, the jewellery firm witnessed huge bullion purchases worth Rs 100 crore involving 5200 customers. While the firm owners claim that they sold bullion to the customers, the probe agency is suspecting money laundering. Whether the firm was dealing with somebody's black money is also one of the questions the ED sleuths have in their minds, sources said.
 
 Since Nikhil, Nithin and other associates have approached the court for anticipatory bail and the same is likely to be heard next week, the ED authorities are waiting for the verdict. Also, some bullion traders who too are in the radar of the investigators have approached the court seeking freedom from police calls. According to them, since their regular bullion business was linked to the Musaddilal episode, they are being repeatedly called by the police. ED is waiting for the result of this tussle as well because it wants to question the bullion traders.
