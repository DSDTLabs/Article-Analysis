MUMBAI: Critical of the tardy approach of the   in identifying and allotting 60 acres of land for   near the city, the   summoned principal secretaries of urban development and revenue departments on February 28. The bureaucrats will have to inform the court which land would be allotted to the law university.

 While hearing a PIL by lawyer Pradeep Havnur that highlighted A lack of infrastructure in the Mumbai law university, a bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre got testy when the state was still not ready with the land. “Don’t ask courts to find land for your projects. This is your university,” said the bench. “You have land to be given for mega projects which are also not happening.”
 
 Reminding the state that the law university “is an important project”, the HC observed that a large number of plots received under ULCRA were available with the government and one them, suitable for establishing a university could be easily given. 
 
 Senior counsel Milind Sathe appearing for Havnur pointed out that the first national law university in the country was established in Bengaluru in 1987. “And, in 2018, we are struggling to set up a first national law university in Mumbai,” he said.
