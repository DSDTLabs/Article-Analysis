Singer-actor   has reportedly introduced his rumoured   and model   to his family.

 
  
 
 The musician, 23, is thought to have been seeing the model since the summer; and has now taken things to the next stage.
 
 According to a report, Styles brought Rowe, 27, home to meet his parents and sister Gemma during the festive season. 
 
 "Camille's come along at exactly the right point in Harry's life. He's had plenty of fun but seems to be content hanging out with her. They get on great. She's laid back and cool, plus she's been really supportive of his career. The relationship is still fairly relaxed, he's hardly at the stage where they see each other every day," a source said.
 
 "But Camille has also bonded with his sister Gemma and best pal  , which is hugely important to Harry," the source added.
