VELLORE:   K S Kandasamy on Friday placed secretaries of four panchayats along the   under   for failing to prevent miscreants from charging devotees using  . The collector also caught hold of two such miscreants and handed them over to the police.

 According to officials, the district administration had last year directed the local bodies not to charge the public for using the public toilets on Pournamis (full moon days) and Maha Karthigai Deepam festival. 
 
 However, the authorities of the local bodies have failed to execute the direction. The lapse came to light when the collector, along with his family members, was performing Girivalam on Pournami (Thursday evening). When he was passing through Athianthal village, he conducted a surprise check at the public toilets along the Girivalam path.
 
 On noticing that Rs 10 was being collected from each devotee using the public toilet, he too decided to use the facility. Not recognising it was the collector, two men manning the toilet demanded the sum from him as well, following which the collector handed them over to the Tiruvannamalai taluk police.
 
 Similarly, he learned that same was the case in Adi Annamalai, Aanaipirandhan and Vengikal panchayats. Following this, he directed to place the secretaries of the four panchayats, including Athianthal, under suspension for failing to keep a check on such miscreants.
