MYSURU: Writer HS Ramachandregowda and activist, member of the board of management of the   (KSOU) KS Shivaramu warned they will show black flags at the BJP Parivarthana Yatra valedictory here on January 25 to pressurise BJP national president Amit Shah to resolve the   crisis.

 They told reporters here on Tuesday that if the   (UGC) did not resolve the crisis before February 15, they, along with students, would seize the   headquarters in New Delhi.
 
 Ramachandregowda said that KSOU has completed all formalities for renewal of affiliation and all documents have been submitted. Even the Karnataka high court has issued directions to the UGC on this matter, but the UGC is not ready to renew the affiliation. "KSOU is a university set up for poor students. But, UGC is playing with the future of these students,” he alleged.
 
 "Union human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar is not serious about this issue. Earlier, he assured us of following the Karnataka high court order. But, now UGC is moving a writ petition in the high court. Why he is playing a double role?" he asked, adding, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi must intervene."
 
 KS Shivaramu said, "When we met Javadekar in a delegation, he assured us of recognising the in-house courses. Now, he is silent."
 
 "On January 25, black flags will be shown to both Amit Shah and Javadekar who are scheduled to attend the valedictory of the Parivarthana Samavesha,” he said.
 
 Writer K S Bhagawan said UGC is playing with the future of poor candidates and it must apologize to them for the ongoing fiasco.
