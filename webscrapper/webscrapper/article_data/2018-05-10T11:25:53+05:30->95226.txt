Celebrated chef and   awardee   has launched with his debut fiction, titled 
 . The author of more than 10 luscious books about food and culinary art, Chef Vikas Khanna is all set to spice up the 
 of fiction this time. 

 
 , published by  , relates the story of a rare relationship between a tightrope-walking beggar and a moksha-seeking widow that lives on beyond their derelict existences on the fringes of those of more fortunate beings. Pitting the smoke rising from the funeral pyres of Manikarnika Ghat, against the joyous colour-bursts of Holi celebrations, this marvelously layered story of the survival of a delicate friendship, is brilliantly told and poignantly life-affirming. 
 
 Khanna says, "I first saw the widows of Varanasi in 2009 when they were prohibited from playing Holi, and then later in 2012, when I saw the white widows drenched in the colours of Holi. The image haunted me; I could not forget the image sight of their joyous abandon. It was not about the colour, it was about the transformation of society. It touched me so deeply that I wrote a book about them." He adds, "
  is a story of an unlikely friendship, of promises kept, of taboos broken and the victory of the human kind." 
 
 The book along with the trailer of the motion picture adapted from the same starring Neena Gupta in the lead is being released on May 9, at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.
