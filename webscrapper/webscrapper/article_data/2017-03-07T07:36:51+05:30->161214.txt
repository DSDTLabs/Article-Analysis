NAVI MUMBAI: The   have made two more arrests in the  , taking the total number of arrests in the case to four.

 The latest arrests, of an external HSC student,   (19), and a coaching class teacher, Suresh Jha (26), were made from Kandivli around 3.40am on Monday . The first arrests, of two BCom students, Rahul Bhaskar (22) and Azaruddin Shaikh (20), were made in Malwani, Malad, late on Sunday .
 
 The investigating team has seized 21 mobile phones from the suspects, who include exam candidates. The phones have been confiscated after WhatsApp messages linked to the leaked papers were traced back to them.
 
 DCP (Zone-1) Prashant Khaire said, “Those who have been arrested were found to have forwarded the HSC secretarial practice question paper in a WhatsApp group. As they had deliberately forwarded the paper 1520 minutes before the test started, and did not inform the police about the paper leak, their intention was apparently to indulge in misconduct.“
 
 The four have been remanded in police custody till March 9.
 
 In the HSC Marathi test paper leak case, the police are yet to trace the accused. A police officer said, “ After media reports about the first two arrests regarding the secretarial practice paper leak, many beneficiaries of the Marathi paper leak have deleted the question paper from their WhatsApp. Some have even exited from the groups concerned. Hence, now we will have to seek the help of forensic experts to retrieve the deleted data.This will prove to be a Herculean task for the investigating police team.“
 
 Khaire said, “ As several students have benefited from the paper leak on WhatsApp messaging groups, all will be summoned for questioning, but only after the exams are over.“
