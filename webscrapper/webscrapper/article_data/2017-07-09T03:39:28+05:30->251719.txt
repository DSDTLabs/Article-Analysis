NAVI MUMBAI: As many as 92 licenced   have been shortlisted to be housed on the first daily vegetable-fish market for   node. 

 According to civic sources, the market will be ready by this year end. Work on the Rs 3.82 crore market yard has resumed after local vendors opposed the civic plan for building two-storey structure.
 
 The protesters were pressing for construction of sheds in lieu of concrete structure which was turned down by the civic administration.   plans to rent out the first floor for various activities and programmes to make up the maintenance cost. The slab-laying work of the ground floor has begun where the vendors will move in for free.
 
 “We are confident about completing the project on time. Since the pending issues have been resolved there is no reason of delay. The agency has been asked to hand over the project by end of November as per the contract clause. We have overcome all obstacles now,” said Sanjay Desai, NMMC executive engineer.
 
 The civic market is coming up at sector 5, a stone’s throw away from NMMC’s multipurpose hall and proposed Airoli auditorium. 
 
 In the absence of an organized hawkers plaza in the area, roadside vendors have usurped the roads and footpaths in the surrounding areas, creating traffic chaos. 
 
 As the construction work is on for the daily market, the licenced vendors have been provided with temporary tarpaulin sheds to carry out their business.
 
 “Once the market is ready, traffic jam and commotions will cease. We charted our plans to construct ground plus first floor building. The ground floor with 92 shops will be given to licenced vegetable and fish vendors whereas the first will have a hall,” said officials.
 
 Local corporator M K Madhavi said, “Some vendors under the influence of local politicians halted the work abruptly and demanded for sheds instead of concrete structures which is not possible now.”
