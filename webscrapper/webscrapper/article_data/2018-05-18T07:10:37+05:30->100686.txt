PANAJI: A sharp fall in revenue forced Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) to borrow Rs 5 crore from a leading national bank in April in order to meet expenditure requirements for salaries and maintenance. With a monthly bill of Rs 25 crore,   had proposed a salary cut for the month of May, but the proposal has now been shelved since container traffic and operations at Adani Mormugao Port Terminal have improved, said MPT chairman I  .

 “Last month, MPT took a Rs 5 crore overdraft because there was a shortfall. Otherwise, we would have had to cut into our reserves or prematurely touch deposits,” Jeyakumar explained.
 
 MPT’s earlier proposal met with criticism from the Mormugao Port & Railway Workers union, which had urged MPT to recover dues from the private berth operators instead of introducing salary cuts for port employees. “The union has urged MPT to recover dues from Adani and other clients,” a union leader said.
 
 MPT also has other options before it to reduce its monthly expenditure bill, including a reduction in the number of diesel locomotives, and reduction of rental cars and heavy machinery.
 
 “Since there is a drop in the number of rail rakes, MPT should stop hiring railway engines since there is no need. The booking has to be done on need basis from South Western railway. The hired SUN locomotives should be discharged immediately due to its non-performance,” the union said.
 
 While MPT has yet to decide on the suggestions, Jeyakumar said that a final decision about cost-cutting measures and further borrowing would be taken on May 25.
 
 “We will wait till May 25 to see how much revenue comes in,” said the MPT chairman. The union has also called for the appointment of a full-time chairman by saying that Jeyakumar, who has additional charge of Tutticorin port, is unable to handle the present crisis facing MPT.
