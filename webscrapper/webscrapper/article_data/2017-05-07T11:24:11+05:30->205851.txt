BIJNOR: Amid ongoing debate on triple talaq across the country, as many as 600 women took to the streets in Chandpur block of Bijnor district protesting against “attempt to fiddle with the triple talaq practice”.

  In memoranda to President   and Prime Minister  , which was submitted to Chandpur SDM Azad  , the protesting women objected to proposed changes in the tripal talaq custom.
 
    local leadership described the protest as “politically motivated”, citing the presence of   leader  . “Desperate to gain its lost ground, the BSP is trying to project itself as a well-wisher of the Muslim community,” said a BJP leader.
 
  On Saturday morning, Muslim women gathered in large number at the house of former BSP MLA Mohammad Iqbal, and marched to tehsil under his leadership, raising slogans in favour of triple talaq.
 
  Their memos read as: “In India only one aspect of triple talaq is being highlighted and only false facts are being presented. Those women who are approaching the Supreme Court are also in a quandary. They are in very small number, and are not representatives of the Indian Muslim women. 
 
 The apex court, while giving justice to these women should also consider the rights of majority of Muslim women as above 99% Indian Muslim women think that it is against their basic religious rights. At no cost we will like any intervention in triple talaq.”
