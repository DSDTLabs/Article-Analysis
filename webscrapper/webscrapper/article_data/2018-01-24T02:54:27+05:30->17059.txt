NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday asked the Centre to take a decision within three months on   government’s proposal to remit the sentences of seven life-term convicts in the   assassination case. 

 The state government wrote to the Centre on February 19, 2014 informing that it had decided to release the seven convicts. But without waiting for a response, it remitted the sentence. The Centre then approached the apex court which had held that it was necessary to seek the Centre’s concurrence in criminal cases probed by a central agency. 
 
 On December 2, 2015, a fivejudge Constitution Bench interpreted the law to hold that states could not unilaterally remit the sentences of convicts in cases investigated by a central agency. Settling the issue of law, the Constitution Bench, however, had referred the issue of remitting the sentence of the former PM’s killers to a three-judge bench. 
 
 As the Centre has not yet responded to the communication of the state government, a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi, A M Sapre and Navin Sinha on Tuesday asked additional solicitor general   to take a call on it within three months. 
 
 The seven convicts of Rajiv Gandhis assassination — V Sriharan alias Murugan, T Suthendraraja alias Santham, A G Perarivalan alias Arivu, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, P Ravichandaran and   — have been in jail for the last 25 years. The SC had on February 18, 2014, commuted the death sentence of three convicts — Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan — citing inordinate delay by the Executive in deciding their mercy plea.
