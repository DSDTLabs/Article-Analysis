SURAT: Surat's famed diamond cutting and polishing industry is staring at difficult times with   capped to Rs three lakh in the union budget 2017-18 as most of the high-value sales are largely cash-driven.
Those expected to take a huge hit are the small and medium diamantaires who are already reeling under severe cash crunch  . There are close to 4,000 diamond units in Surat of which merely 200 are big ones with a turnover exceeding Rs 100 crore.
 
 The problem is going to be compounded after February 15 as angadias (couriers firms) have refused to accept the delivery of cash due to   circular. A large majority of the small and medium players are yet to even open current accounts, which could push them closure.
 
 Similarly gold jewellery makers are also expected to be affected adversely by the cap. Industry players said that high-value buying jewellery and bullion would be impacted. In industry with a turnover Rs one lakh crore, the small of Rs one lakh crore, the small and medium diamantaires contribute around 30-35 per cent in the manufacturing of polished diamonds. Out of the total 4,000 diamond units, there are over 150 big units having turnover of more than Rs 200 crore, while the rests are small and medium units having turnover less than Rs 50 crore per annum.
 
 A 10 carat of polished diamonds in lower category costs anything between Rs 4 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. If the small manufacturer want to sell, the trader would refuse to pay the amount in cash. At present, the traders are asking for huge discounts on the diamonds for cash payment.
 
 Pravin Shanker Pandya, chairman, Gems and   (GJEPC), said, “It is mandatory for the small players in the industry to open bank accounts and enter into the official system of doing business. The Rs 3 lakh cash transaction limit is going to hit them hard. We are strongly pursuing the issue with the central Government.“
