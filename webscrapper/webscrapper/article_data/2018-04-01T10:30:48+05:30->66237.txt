AHMEDABAD: Thirty-three years after the murder of a constable in Khadia in anti-reservation riots, a city sessions court on Saturday issued bailable warrants against eight BJP leaders including ex-MP   and AMC corporator Mayur Dave.

 Additional sessions judge N P Syed has posted further proceeding in this case on April 2, when the accused persons have been ordered to remain present in court.
 
 On April 22,  , police head constable Lakshman Desai was killed in the violence that broke out in Khadia during the visit of a court commissioner. Former parliamentarian Pathak, former minister Ashok Bhatt, and Dave were accused for inciting the mob.
 
 Pathak and Bhatt were discharged by Gujarat high court in 2006. Desaiâ€™s widow Ladkiben moved the Supreme Court and challenged the discharge order. The apex court had stayed proceedings in court. However, with the SC vacating the stay recently, the trial court has taken up the case and issued warrants against the accused persons. Since Bhatt has passed away during the pendency of the case, warrants have been issued against seven persons, including Kiran Shah and Madhukant Vyas apart from Pathak and Dave, said public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt.
