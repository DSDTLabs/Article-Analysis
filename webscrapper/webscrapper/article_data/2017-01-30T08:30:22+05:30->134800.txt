VARANASI: The denial of a party ticket did not deter   member and sitting MLA from Zahoorabad constituency,  , from taking out a road show at her constituency in Ghazipur district on Sunday.

 Addressing a public meeting at Barachavar, Fatima said she would be contesting the polls from Zahoorabad seat and had the `blessings' of `netaji' (SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav). “Netaji has directed me to go to my constituency to campaign, as I have to contest the election,“ she said, adding that   would take the matter to SP supremo and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.
 
 Fatima had won Zahoorabad seat twice in the 2007 and 2012 assembly elections. However, she has be en denied the ticket this time as SP has announced Mahendra Chauhan as its candidate.
 
 In October last year, Akhilesh had sacked uncle Shiv pal Yadav and three other ministers -Shadab Fatima, Narad Rai and Om Prakash Singh -from his cabinet.
 
 Speaking at the rally, she said there was a conspiracy to deny her a ticket, but she didn't want to the name people involved in it.
 
 She, however, did not forget to speak in favour of Akhilesh Yadav. “The CM has said that development is the main poll plank, and I can say that I have set a development record in Zahoorabad constituency,“ she said, adding that a network of roads was built in the past five years.
 
 An impressive crowd attended Fatima's road show which crossed several localities like Bahadurganj, Kasimabad, Gangauli, Alawalpur, Zahoorabad and Mata. She will begin her door-to-door campaign from January 31, said her representative  , adding that she is getting mass support to contest the election.
