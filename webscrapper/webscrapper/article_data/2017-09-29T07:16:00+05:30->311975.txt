GURUGRAM: A  ,  , has lost over Rs 19 crore due to a technical glitch apparently in its own  .

 Company officials said the money was allegedly deducted from the firm’s own corporate account during online transactions made by   using the wallet for recharge, bill payment, shopping etc. While the suspected glitch benefited a number of customers, who did not have to pay for their transactions, the company lost total Rs 19.61 crore over the past three-and-a-half months.
 
 The glitch and resulted losses came to fore during a routine internal audit recently, following which the company lodged a complaint at Sector 53 police station on Wednesday and the cybercrime cell began investigation into the matter.
 
 In his complaint, Lokesh Rajpal, general counsel of MobiKwik, alleged that certain people took advantage of the technical glitch and transferred money from the wallet to different accounts.
 
 Apart from mobile recharge, bill payment and shopping, customers can also use their MobiKwik wallets to transfer money to their bank accounts.
 
 “Anybody can transfer the amount from his or her mobile wallet to bank account. And, taking advantage of the technical glitch, some people transferred money to different accounts,” Rajpal stated in the complaint.
 
 “Prima facie it seems to be a technical glitch. We have started investigation into the matter and are trying to find out if there is any fraud involved,” said inspector Anand Yadav, in charge of the cybercrime cell.
 
 Allaying customers’ fears, Mobikwik spokesperson Suresh Vaidyanathan said, “We reassure our customers that users’ data and money are safe and secure, and nothing has been compromised. We have taken immediate action by lodging an FIR with the Gurgaon police’s cyber cell.”
