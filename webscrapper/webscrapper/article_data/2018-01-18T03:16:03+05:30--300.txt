NEW DELHI:   on Wednesday blamed   Anil Baijal for   the process of   the  . The post has been lying vacant for one and a half years and this is perpetuating “misuse of waqf property and leading to corruption”, its legislators claimed in the assembly. 

 The House also passed a resolution seeking a magisterial probe into 36 cases that Delhi Waqf Board had lost in court. 
 
 The report of Question and Reference Committee, adopted on Wednesday, highlights the case of illegal sale of a part of the dargah of Hazrat Naseeruddin Aulia Raushan in Chirag Dilli. Citing this, AAP claimed that waqf properties were under threat. “As there has been no chairperson, waqf properties are being encroached upon,” said Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said, “I don’t know why the LG is not appointing the chairperson as all procedures had been followed.” 
 
 The committee, chaired by Mangolpuri MLA and deputy speaker Rakhi Birla, recommended that the chief secretary ensure that an elected representative heads the board. 
 
 It suggested that the chief secretary initiate criminal proceedings against section officer K A Farooqi of the board for his acts of “ommission and commission” and “connivance” with the so-called khadims and purchaser in the dargah sale. The committee has put on record that the dargah is duly gazetted as a waqf property on December 31, 1970 and is non-transferable under Delhi Waqf Act.
 
 An agency report said the former chairman of the board, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan, resigned as its member on Wednesday, saying his step might prompt the LG to reconstitute it.
 
  In March 2016, a complaint was filed against these so called khadims.
