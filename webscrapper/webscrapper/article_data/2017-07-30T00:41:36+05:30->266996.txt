BENGALURU: They are the independent felines who hang out on their terms in the neighbourhood. It’s either food or innate curiosity that keeps the typical “Indian Billy”, the native cat, moving around gracefully. The Indian   may not be a popular choice among adoptive owners.

 But its meows have certainly gained the attention of the   ( ) which is going that extra mile to get the household cat an  .
 
 ICF, in association with veterinary colleges across India, is in the process of conducting research programmes to study and collate information on local Indian cats to get the felines approved as an international breed — ‘Billy’.
 
 Identification and understanding the unique traits of the Indian cat will facilitate the approval. The federation hopes this will elevate the status of our street cats internationally, and eventually, more of them will get adopted.
 
 “In India, cats are discarded just as an animal, and they spend their life mostly on the streets. Pet lovers usually adopt Persian, British, Bengal or Siberian cats. Indian cats are not preferred. An international Billy tag may get them more adoptive owners,” says ICF spokesperson Fatima Siamwala. She said the average lifespan of a Billy is about 18 years if it is taken care of at home. “If they remain strays, they are prone to accidents and dog attacks. They won’t survive beyond 10 years.” 
 
 ICF considers Billy as one of the strongest cats despite its slender frame. “The medium-strong boning, strong muscles, rectangular format, and shoulder& hips of even length are unique to Indian Billy. The legs are medium long, paws are oval and the long tail almost reaches the shoulder. Female cats are usually smaller, more elegant than the males,” said ICF treasurer Ravi Reddy.
