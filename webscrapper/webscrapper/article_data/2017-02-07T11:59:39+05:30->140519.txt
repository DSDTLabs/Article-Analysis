SURAT: City police are trying to maintain law and order for the past 20 days against all odds. Repetitive attempts by miscreants to disturb law and order situation have created a challenging situation for the police.

 Six people had died due to consumption of spurious liquor after January 15, then there was rioting in Godadara of Limbayat over a calf’s head, followed by   (PAAS) members targeting a rally of Bharatiya Janata Youth Morcha state unit president   and   workers garlanding railway minister   with a black scarf in the city on Sunday.
 
 Exasperated with their misdeeds, police have acted tough by arresting maximum accused from the spot in the last three incidents which were masterminded by the activists of political parties or their specific groups.
 
 “We had arrested 41 people from the spot for their role in Godadara rioting. Similarly, 18 people were arrested on the same day when BJYM rally was targeted. We arrested 12 people for the demonstration in the presence of a central minister,” city police commissioner   said. 
 
 “We are taking strict action against people breaking law to give a clear message that such things will not be tolerated. Political party workers had got too close to a central minister which was risky. They have been booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code,” Sharma added.
