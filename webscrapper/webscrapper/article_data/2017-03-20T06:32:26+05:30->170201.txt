NASHIK: The garbage vans across the city have been making announcements, sensitizing people about   for the past 15 days, but have failed to garner positive response from the citizens.

 From next month, the   ( ) will be slapping fines on citizens for not segregating waste at the source. Garbage van attendants said if the citizens do not comply, they cannot force them and will segregate the waste themselves.
 
 One of the garbage van attendants in Ganeshwadi area said, “We cannot ask citizens to segregate waste. We do have different sections for wet and dry waste but no one gives us segregated waste. Even if we get wet waste in different bags it is not totally wet waste. So, at the compost plant it has to be segregated once again.”
 
 Another garbage van attendant in   area said the residents of this area were ignorant about wet and dry waste. “We hope the announcements made by the vans manage to bring some positive result. If citizens do not comply, we cannot force them,” he said.
 
 Some citizens who hand over segregated waste say that the partition for wet and dry garbage is of no use as the garbage gets mixed anyway.
 
 “We hand over segregated waste but have noticed that the partition is not very firm to keep both the waste intact. Garbage vans should have been modified properly with proper partition and two windows on the side for waste collection rather than collecting all the waste from the door behind,” said  , a housewife from Panchavati area.
 
 “From April we will start slapping fines on citizens for not segregating dry and wet waste. Currently, we are deciding on the amount to be charged,” said NMC’s health officer Vijay Dekate.
