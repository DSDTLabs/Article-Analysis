Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have relinquished the India captaincy, but his leadership qualities were very much to the fore at the   on Wednesday when he guided   to a 42-run win over Saurashtra in a low-scoring Group 'D'   match. Jharkhand's third win in four matches in the ongoing league stage notwithstanding, Dhoni was an unhappy man. Right after the customary handshakes at the end of the match, Dhoni walked straight up to local curator Sujan Mukherjee and expressed his displeasure with the Eden pitch.

 Mukherjee denied any such talk with Dhoni, but Jharkhand coach Rajiv Kumar said such a wicket was 'poor advertisement for the game'. “It was a difficult wicket to bat on,” Kumar said before leaving the venue.
