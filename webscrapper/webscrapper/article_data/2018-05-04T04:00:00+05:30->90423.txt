Rajkot: Five robbers were arrested on Thursday for killing Bheema Modhvadia (55) and injuring his wife Lakhi (50) and looting cash and jewellery worth Rs 5.1 lakh in Bharwada village of Porbandar taluka at night on February 17. 

 Police identified the accused as Bhimsinh Adivasi alias Mangalia, Jiten Adivasi, Parsing Adivasi, Nagaru Adivasi and Sunil Adivasi, all natives of Dhar district in Madhya Pradesh. 
 
 “Both Bhimsinh and Jiten used to work at Modhvadia’s farm as labourers earlier and knew about his wealth. They are the ones who had hatched the conspiracy of loot. On the fateful night, the accused, who had covered their faces with handkerchief, had attacked the Modhvadia couple with scythes, iron pipes and sticks, killing Modhvadia on the spot and seriously injuring Lakhi,” said Porbandar local crime branch inspector P K Bharai. 
 
 “During investigation, we quizzed several farm labourers from whom we got to know that Bhimsinh used to work at Modhvadia’s farm. This raised our suspicion, following which we detained Bhimsinh and interrogated him. During interrogation, Bhimsinh broke down and confessed to the crime, revealing names of co-accused, leading to their arrests,” added Bharai. 
 
 The robbers had met at Porbandar chowpati on February 16 where they hatched the loot conspiracy and committed the crime on February 17. Police have recovered Rs 42,000 cash from the accused.
