CHENNAI: The police practice of arresting parents and relatives of boys in   of   would amount to social wrong and law enforcing authorities must be sensitised against such wrongful action, the Madras   said on Thursday.

 A division bench of Justice C T Selvam and Justice N Sathish Kumar made the observation on a habeas corpus plea to trace a 17-year-old girl who had eloped with a 19-year-old man in Namakkal.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, inspector of police concerned said the boy’s mother had been arrested and remanded in judicial custody, and added that her confession revealed her involvement in the case. 
 
 To this the bench said: “This court notes that all too frequently parents and relatives of the boys are, without a second thought, arrayed as accused in cases registered against boys and girls going missing, most commonly owing to love affairs. The parents are taken into custody. In many a case, this would amount to a social wrong at the hands of police agency, whose very being is serving a social cause.”
 
 The bench also directed the superintendent of central prison for women at Salem to release the mother, while taking all efforts to trace the missing girl. However, the bench clarified that the court was not to be understood as informing that in no cases should relatives of accused be proceeded against. “This court only wishes to impress upon the need for caution before doing so,” the judges added. They then directed that the order be forwarded to the DGP towards sensitizing the force against wrongful action in such matters.
