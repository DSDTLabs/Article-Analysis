 Actor-host  , who was in Lucknow a few weeks ago, said that he is happy hosting shows than doing fiction on TV. "Acting remains my first love. But having said that, I have to be creatively convinced to accept any script. I have read several scripts for TV serials in the past few months but nothing worked out. Sometimes you don't get the right kind of story you want and on the other hand, sometimes you don't get the opportunity for what you really want to do. I want to be happy and hosting is making me happy," he shared. 
 When asked how has his hosting improved over the period, Rithvik said, "I think my anchoring skills have improved a lot by looking at different people, by learning from different people and by working with different people. I have learned so much from my peers, who have been hosting like Manish (Paul), I worked with him a couple of times, learned so much from him. I have learned so much from comedians  ,   and  . So, all these actors who have nailed it when it comes to being the comic relief on their shows, I have learned from them and have applied that learnt formula in my hosting."
 Rithvik has been to Lucknow several times in the past, said Lakhnawi food is the yummiest. "I still remember the yummy food that I had the last time I was here. It was, I think, sheermaal, an orange roti kind of thing which I ate with chicken curry. Today also I am planning to have the famous kebabs of Lucknow," he said.
