CHENNAI:  , trailing 2-7 to Shaze Challengers, were banking on Rio Olympics bronze medallist   I of   to come good and reduce the increasing gap. But the World No 19 had a disappointing game against higher-ranked (world No 9) German  . Kim, despite winning the first game, couldn't capitalise on her lead and conceded to two straight games to lose the match 11-6, 9-11, 10-11 to Han Ying. It helped Challengers increase their lead to 10-5 on the second day of inaugural Ultimate Table Tennis (UTT) League at the Nehru Indoor Stadium on Friday. They went on to bag the tie 15-12.

 Kim, given her recent form and achievement in Rio Games, was favourite in the match but Han Ying proved that she was no pushover. The Liaoning-born paddler who played for China and now represents Germany, is one the best defensive players at present. She didn't attack much and waited for her chance to score points.
 
 "This was one of the toughest games I have played for a while. Kim is top quality player she and wasn't giving me any leeway. It was a neck-to-neck fight till the end and I must say this was a well-earned win as we had just lost the previous match 1-2," Han Ying said.
