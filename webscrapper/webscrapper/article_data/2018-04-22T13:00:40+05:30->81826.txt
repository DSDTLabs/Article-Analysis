LUDHIANA: Pankaj Munjal, chairman of Ludhiana-based Hero Cycles — along with sons Aditya and Abhishek — met the prime ministers of India and UK, Narendra   and Theresa  , on the eve of the 25th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) at a business function held in the United Kingdom on Wednesday. The two governments had issued a joint statement in pursuance of a bilateral trade agreement that mentioned cooperation and collaboration in dealing with, among other things, the threat of climate change and urban sustainable development.

 Issuing a statement after meeting the prime ministers of both nations, Munjal said: “The Commonwealth Summit provides an excellent opportunity for both these nations, entwined by historical ties, to take the lead in organizing sustainable development and fending off climate change. We pride ourselves for being a part of green mobility and fitness lifestyle through cycling. Our company has made it big in the UK, and we intend to expand to mainland Europe soon with our patently English brand, Insync. We feel the time has come to integrate cycling as a critical component of projects such as smart cities, carbon emission reduction, and traffic management.”
