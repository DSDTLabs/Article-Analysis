CHENNAI: Madras high court on Tuesday granted conditional anticipatory bail to disqualified   legislators P   and   who apprehended arrest in connection with a case registered against them for allegedly preventing police personnel from discharging their duties at the secretariat on March 1. 

 While allowing the applications moved by the two, Justice A D   directed them to appear before Tallakulam police in Madurai daily for two weeks.
 
 According to the petitioners, after the internal split in AIADMK, they joined the faction led by   and T T V Dhinakaran, due to which they were disqualified as MLAs. On March 1, they visited the secretariat to meet government officials in connection with the alleged irregularities in awarding tenders for major road projects in the state. "When Selvan went inside the secretariat, Vetrivel was surrounded by the media present near the main gate. As he was attempting to address reporters regarding his visit, two inspectors posted at the gate rushed towards him, verbally abused him and manhandled him... Selvan was not present near the gate throughout the incident," counsel for the petitioners said.
