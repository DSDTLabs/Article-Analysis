Madurai: Members of the Eddapadi Parvatharajakula community, who enjoy the privilege of staying the night at the Palani Dhandayudhapani temple once a year after the Thaipoosam festival, performed their customary rituals on Monday night for the 358th consecutive year.

 Every year, thousands of pilgrims from Eddapadi take out a padayatra to the Palani temple carrying ‘kavadis’ on the second day after the Thaipoosam festival concludes. This year, around 40,000 devotees who reached the temple were allowed to spend the night on the premises. The temple opens at 5 am and closes at 9 pm, the period during which devotees can offer darshan there. The Edapadi pilgrims who descend after 9 pm are the only ones allowed to stay on hill top for a night. There they prepare tonnes of panchamirtham using the fruits they carry up the hill along with honey, dates and sugar.
 
 On Monday night, 15 tonnes of panchamirtham was prepared by them which was used for performing àbishekam to the deity. They also drew the golden chariot of the temple during the night to celebrate this privilege accorded to them. They came down on Tuesday evening and will return to their village carrying their kavadis.
