MUMBAI:  's   flight was diverted to   in Japan for an emergency landing on Monday after a co-pilot suffered a heart attack. The pilot, however, was not part of the crew rostered to operate that day and was flying as a passenger. The pilot underwent angioplasty and is now recuperating in Sapporo. 

 The first officer, who was on board as a supernumerary, took ill when the aircraft was over the Pacific. The diversion itself was three-hour long and with the aircraft nowhere close to land, the crew was left with no option but to administer him emergency medications.
 
 "It was difficult for the cabin crew to see the pilot in such pain, but they handled the situation exceptionally well. In the three hours it took to land, the pilot was administered eight sorbitrates under the tongue," said a source.
 
 "Faraz Akhtar, a cabin crew, was the first to notice that the captain, seated in the business class, was in distress," the source added. Ultra long haul flights like Delhi-San Francisco have two sets of cockpit crew on board. The said pilot was part of the team bound for the Boeing assembly plant in Seattle, where he was scheduled to take delivery of a new aircraft and fly it to India.
 
 AI 173, which departed Delhi at 4.30am (local time) was expected to land in San Francisco at 6am (local time). It was well into its Pacific crossing when the flight deck was informed about the medical emergency on board. The cockpit crew, Captain Shubhangi Singh and Captain Ramya Gupta, decided to divert to the closest airport, Sapporo. On ground, paramedics and an ambulance waited for the flight to land. Paramedics rushed in for an ECG, which showed signs of at least two myocardial infarctions, the source added. The pilot was taken to a hospital where an emergency angioplasty was performed. 
 
 "Timely medical intervention is what saved his life. Had we not diverted, the story would have been different," the source said.
