Composer  , who comes out with songs on special days, has got singer   to croon his Women’s Day song. Titled  , this one is a song that portrays the imbalance of rights and position which women face today. Their plight seems to continue, in spite of many women achievers excelling in various fields, hitherto dominated by men. It is a cry of love, for men to wake up, to put the balance of equality between the two sexes in order. 

 Talking about her experience rendering this song, Maalavika says, “It is nice to have different days dedicated to different things. The opportunity to sing this song came from a dear friend of mine. She put me on to Kumar for a song on Women’s Day. We had a great time recording this one.” Does she think songs like these will bring some change in the society? “Of course, it does. Also, today the mentality of people has changed. The society, too, has become different. The current generation sees no discrimination between men and women. Everyone is pretty chilled out and respect each other. That change is important,” she says. The song is arranged and programmed by Sajan Shenoy and R Kumar Narayanan.
