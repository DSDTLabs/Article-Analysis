KOCHI:   has an impact on   in the Western Ghats, says a study by researchers at  .

 According to the study presented at the recently concluded   at Thiruvalla, there is a change in nutrient levels in the soil and this could play a role in   ecosystem of Western Ghats.
 
 “We had taken soil samples from areas in Pandaravara of Parambikulam Tiger Reserve (Sungam range). The surface samples were collected before the fire and also in the first, third and sixth months after the area was burnt in forest fire,“ said Ninu Jose M, who did the study .
 
 According to the Kerala Forest Department, a total of 417.83 ha of forest areas distributed in 26 locations have been damaged by forest fires in Wayanad district alone.
 
 The study, `Thermodynamics and geo-chemical transformation of fire-affected grass land ecosystems in Kerala Western Ghats' found that frequent fires at the same location causes loss of soil components and minerals.
 
 The Kerala forest department uses fire as a management tool in grassland ecosystems in Western Ghats to ensure that the grass-eating animals get a fresh cover of vegetation among others.
 
 “We are looking at various factors that can impact the ecosystem after frequent fires.This has not been done before.There was an understanding that systems recovered back to normal but it does not look as easy as that,“ said KFRI senior soil scientist Sujatha M P .
