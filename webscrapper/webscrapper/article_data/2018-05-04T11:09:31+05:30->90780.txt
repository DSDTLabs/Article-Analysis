CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday ordered notice to the state government on a PIL seeking a direction to constitute a special investigation team ( ), comprising women police officers and led by a gender-sensitive officer in the rank of deputy inspector general of police, to probe the allegations against Nirmala Devi, an assistant professor of Devanga Arts College at   in Virudhunagar district. It has been alleged that   had tried to lure girl students to offer sexual favours to higher officials of Madurai Kamarajar University. 

 A vacation bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice N Seshasayee issued the notice, after observing that though there were a number of judgments restricting publication of name of victims in sexual offences, many media organisations had carried the names of the girls involved in the issue.
 
 The PIL was moved by D Ganesan, state coordinator of the Revolutionary Students' Youth Front (RSYF) - Tamil Nadu. According to him, an audio recording of Nirmala Devi talking to a few students over phone and luring them to subject themselves to satisfy the sexual needs of some higher officials was widely shared on social media on April 16.
 
  Nirmala Devi was arrested and the investigation was also transferred to CB-CID. But, claiming that only an SIT comprising women officials would be a competent mechanism to probe such allegations, he wanted the court to order for constitution of such an SIT.
