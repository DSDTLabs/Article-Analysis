PANAJI: The All Goa Banjara   has demanded an apology from tourism minister   for stating that he would drive away   and touts from Goa.

 General secretary   says the Samaj has condemned the statements made against the nomadic tribe which is listed in the scheduled cast in the federal list of the Union government of India and submitted a memorandum to the minister requesting him to take back his statement, which if not done in due time, the community has threatened to shut down their businesses for a day and hold a peaceful protest. 
 
 “We don’t have a problem with authorities taking action against beggars, hawkers, illegal vendors and drug peddlers along the beach belt but why is our community being singled out,” Lamani said, adding that the entire community is disturbed by the ‘unconstitutional’ statement. 
 
 The community has strength of around two lakh in the state, including floating population where more than one lakh have settled over the past four decades.
 
 In their memorandum, the samaj has challenged the minister to spell out a single case of drug peddling where people from the banjara community are involved.
 
 They have also stated that the community is not a new entrant into tourism in Goa. They migrated from the neighbouring state of Karnataka to help create basic infrastructure when the state was progressing and were the first migrant community to assist in traditional fishing, and today have a sizeable presence among lifeguards, in manning beaches, managing cloth shops along the beach belt, operating water sports, cleaning beaches etc.
