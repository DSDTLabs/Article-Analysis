NEW DELHI: The   imposed a fine of Rs 30 lakh on a Maharashtra dental college on Tuesday for getting an interim order from Bombay high courtâ€™s   bench to admit students for the 2016-17 academic year even when the   (DCI) and the Union government had rejected its request.

 The SC has been strictly following the discipline of not permitting medical and dental colleges to make admissions for an academic year through interim orders as through earlier orders it had set the deadline for completion of counselling and admissions to eliminate manipulations and commercialisation of medical education.
 
 A bench of Justices   and Mohan M Shantanagoudar tore into the HC for passing an interim order allowing Hedgewar Memorial Patient Care Mandal, Hingoli, to admit students at its own risk despite coming to a conclusion that the matter required detailed examination.
