COIMBATORE: A major fire has consumed more than 300 acres of vegetation in the  ,  . Hundreds of fully grown trees and rare herbs were burnt down on Wednesday and Thursday. Smoke from the fire spread across a 5-km radius, spilling over into highways and affecting visibility for a long stretch.

 The fire that began in the forests of Karnataka a few days ago spread to Hasanur. The forest department is struggling to bring the fire under control.
 
 Environmentalists say the extent of damage to wildlife is not known, but smaller animals and insects might have perished in the fire. Most of the bigger animals would have fled to nearby forests.
 
 Motorists said smoke on the   national highway along the Hasanur forests was causing suffocation.“Visibility was severely hit. We could not see what was right in front our vehicles,'' said a motorist. The Mysuru highway is a key stretch which sees hundreds of trucks and cars moving across the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border every day.
 
 “We did our best to prevent the fire from spreading to forest areas in Tamil Nadu from Karnataka. But on Thursday the fire spread to  , razing down several trees along the highway,'' said a Hasanur forest range official.
 
 He said the fire was subsiding and would be put out in a day. He ruled out largescale death of wild animals. “We did not find any carcass so far. The animals might have fled the fire,'' he said.
