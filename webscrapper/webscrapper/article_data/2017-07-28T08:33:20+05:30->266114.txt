LUCKNOW: The vigilance establishment on Thursday lodged an FIR for criminal conspiracy and breach of trust against   MLA from Chunar, Mirzapur,  , and two others after a probe found anomalies worth lakhs of rupees in distribution of scholarships to students of Sardar Patel Post Graduate Institute of Dental and Medical Sciences located on Rae Bareli Road. 

 Singh, who is the president of the institute, has been booked along with accounts manager Pankaj Kumar Vyas and accountant  , on the complaint filed by nine students who alleged that they were not given benefit of the fee reimbursement scholarship of the state social welfare department.

 PGI police station officer Brajesh Rai said that nine students lodged a complaint with the Vigilance Establishment last year that they did not get reimbursement of their annual fee, Rs 2.06 lakh each, from 2008 to 2012. The total amount of all the students taken together came out to be over Rs 75 lakh. Students requested the Vigilance Establishment to probe the matter.
 
 Police said that the investigating officer of the vigilance establishment found irregularities in the reimbursement of money on the part of the institute following which they lodged an FIR against Singh, Sharma and Vyas on Thursday. The vigilance establishment also found anomalies in scholarship distribution of 11 other schedule caste students and a general category student.
