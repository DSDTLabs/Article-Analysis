GURUGRAM: Thieves broke into an ATM booth in   and made off with the machine on Saturday, despite strict instructions to cops to curb such cases. An FIR has been filed.

 A passerby called up   around 7am on Saturday that the cash dispensing machine was missing from an Axis   booth in Bajghera. When a police team arrived at the spot, they noticed that the CCTV camera inside the booth had been damaged. The booth has a guard, but he was not on duty at night. The thieves somehow uprooted the ATM machine and fled with it, cops said. The exact amount in the machine couldn’t be ascertained as the bank was closed for Holi.
 
 An FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the contractor maintaining the ATM at Bajghera police station on Saturday evening under sections 380 (robbery) and 457 (trespassing) of IPC. Sub-inspector Vedpal, the investigating officer, said the bank is yet to furnish details of how much cash was present inside the ATM. 
 
 “We will get more details of how the camera was broken, as well as the cash it contained, only by Monday,” he said.
 
 A departmental inquiry was recently ordered against the SHO of Badshahpur police station after the same ATM was robbed two times in Begampur Khatola village. The SHO was asked to speed up the probe and arrest the accused.
 
 In another case, three persons were arrested on Thursday after an ATM booth was robbed in Bilaspur. They were identified as Surjeet (22) and Bablu (30), both residents of Bulandshahr in UP, and Rahul Sharma (24) of Aligarh. 
 
 Several ATM thefts have been reported in the city since December last year. Banks have been notified to ensure adequate security arrangements in their ATM booths, and senior police offers have issued strict instructions to city cops to man the booths where no guards are deployed at night.
