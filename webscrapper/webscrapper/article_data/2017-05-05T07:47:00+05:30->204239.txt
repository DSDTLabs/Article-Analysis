KOLHAPUR: The frequent   incidents of   learning   have become a headache for applicants as they are forced to wait for hours at the   (RTO) in Kolhapur.

 The transport office started the online learning licence test by using Sarathi 4.0 software system. Under this system, the applicant has to take online appointment for learning licence.
 
 However, when TOI visited the online test centre, it was found that all activities have come to a halt as the server was down and applicants were made to wait outside the examination centre.
 
 An RTO official, on condition of anonymity, said, “Frequent incidents of server down have been attributing to delay in tests. An applicant has to wait for hours for his or her turn. We are running this system on pilot basis. The online appoints are full till May 26, but delay in exams has forced us to postpone the appointments.”
 
 Rajwardhan Desai, an applicant who was at RTO office on Thursday, said as per the online appointment I came here at 12 pm. “The online test server was down and I was told to wait till 3 pm due to which I had to postpone many other works. There should be some discipline in the way RTO is functioning.”
 
 Another applicant, on condition of anonymity, said, “My test was delayed due to technical issue in uploading photos. The RTO officials were helpless as it was a  , but the higher authorities should take cognizance of frequent incidents of server down and other technical details.”
