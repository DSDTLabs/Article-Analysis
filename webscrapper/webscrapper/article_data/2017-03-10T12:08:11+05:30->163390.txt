CHANDIGARH: Justifying his presence during release of the   party’s manifesto for   elections in January, Kaithal MLA and in-charge (communications) of All India Congress Committee ( ) Randeep Singh Surjewala said on Thursday that merely being present where senior leaders -- including former Prime Minister   were in attendance -- did not mean that he had in any way done anything against Haryana’s interests.

 Surjewala, who had come for the first time in the assembly on Thursday during the budget session that had begun on February 27, clarified that touching any document or a piece of paper (manifesto) did not make him anti-Haryana. “Congress has always fought for Haryana’s rights on SYL waters, and everyone knows the   have close family ties with the Badals, and the two parties even jointly contest the   elections,” he said.
 
 Surjewala had joined other senior leaders of Congress, including former PM Manmohan Singh, in January at New Delhi when the election manifesto for Punjab polls was released. The manifesto had mentioned ‘Punjab da paani, Punjab de vaaste’ (Punjab’s water for Punjab).
 
 Surjewala was talking to newspersons in the press lounge of the state assembly to respond to allegations of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD). He said the apex court had given its verdict in Haryana’s favour, and now the ball was in the Centre’s court to get the canal constructed at the earliest.
 
 On a question regarding differences among Congress leaders in Haryana, Surjewala said those were over minor issues, but there are no ideological differences.
