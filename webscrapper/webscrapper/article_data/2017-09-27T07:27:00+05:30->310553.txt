Ludhiana: As part of the ongoing ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’ campaign, civic officials conducted a cleanliness drive in Rose Garden and Leisure Valley on Tuesday. The officials also started compositing of garden waste while burying dry leaves and other things in a pit in the ground. The step has been taken up first in the Rose Garden, and will also be taken up gradually in the rest of the major parks, numbering about 20.

 As per the guidelines of the Swachhta Survekshan-2018, all major parks of the city should have a pit for composting horticulture waste, instead of burning dry leaves and polluting the atmosphere. Officials claimed that the composting of horticulture waste would also help generate manure, which can be further utilized to grow plants in the parks.
 
 Earlier in the morning, sanitation staff was appointed on duty, and waste was cleared from both Rose Garden and Leisure Valley. Both the parks are visited by many residents daily, especially morning and evening walkers. An MC official claimed they had to clear dry leaves from the parks, and instead of throwing them anywhere or setting them on fire, it was better to generate organic manure.
 
 Notably, earlier this year, officials had claimed they would start preparing organic manure at Rose Garden, because in the autumn season, around two to three trolley leaves were collected from Rose Garden alone. Therefore, it was planned that officials would bury the leaves in a pit dug up in the ground, and layers of urea would be piled upon it to help create organic manure. However, the plan could not be implemented at that time for some reason.
