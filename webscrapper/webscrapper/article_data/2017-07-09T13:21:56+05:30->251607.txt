ERODE: Expressing solidarity with the protesting retail textile owners in the district, wholesale textile shop owners across Erode downed their shutters on Saturday as part of a three-day protest against the implementation of Goods and   (GST). The wholesale textile shops would remain closed on Sunday and Monday as well.

 Retail textile shops have been shut since Friday, opposing the tax imposed on the industry at various stages of production. The retail shops would remain closed on Sunday too.
 
 The central government, they said, imposed 5%-18% GST at all stages of textile business assuming dyeing, bleaching, colouring and stitching involved in making a yarn into a cloth were separate segments.
 
 The wholesale textile shop owners said the sum total of all the taxes would come around more than 23% on an average and as a result both the material and the production cost would skyrocket.
 
 They said the GST regime would hit all the small and medium players related to the textile industry hardly.
 
 More than 300 wholesale textile shops in Erode city and more than 10,000 retail shops across the district remained closed on Saturday. They said business to the tune of Rs 30 crore will be affected each day of the strike.
 
 Meanwhile, weavers in Erode, Namakkal and   districts have been on strike for the past one week, opposing GST. The weavers said it would add pressure in procedural difficulties. “The GST will add not less than 25% taxes on our produce against the existing zero percentage,” they said.
 
 Around 90,000 weaving units across the three districts have downed their shutters to extend their support to the textile industry in its fight against GST. Weavers threatened to intensify the protest if they were not exempted from GST.
