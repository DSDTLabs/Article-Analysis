UDAIPUR: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) arrested   at Jaipur on Friday noon in the much hyped mega   haul case. Gunjan is son of Bollywood producer and businessman  , who is the alleged mastermind behind the Rs 10,000-crore mega drug scandal exposed in Udaipur last October.

 Gunjan was produced before the NDPS court here on Saturday. The court sent him to judicial custody till April 13. This is the eighth arrest in the case, as seven persons including Subash Doodhani, his nephews Ravi and Nirmal Doodhani, investor  , chemist Atul Mhatre, a former partner Anil Malkani and a Gujarat based exporter Sanjay R.Patel are already in the Udaipur jail.
 
 “The DRI summoned Gunjan at Jaipur for interrogation. The authorities have some documents and   papers that indicate his involvement in his father’s drug manufacturing and supply business,” Praveen Khandelwal, special public prosecutor in the case told TOI. The DRI is in final stage of investigation and trial in the case would begin soon, Khandelwal added.
 
 The NDPS court turned down an application by Subash Doodhani seeking permission to be interrogated only in the presence of his counsel. Doodhani claimed that the DRI officers were torturing him, his wife and son on the pretext of quizzing. The court, though, said the DRI may quiz him inside the jail in the presence of jail superintendent or any other officer.
