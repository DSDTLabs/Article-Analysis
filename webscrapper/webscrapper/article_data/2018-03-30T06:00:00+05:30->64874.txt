Purulia: A Purulia youth engaged in researching Antartica’s climate died at the world’s southern tip.

 Suvojit Sen (23) was part of the 37th Indian Scientific Expedition to Antartica, a project his family said sees few applicants owing to the risks it involves.
 
 Brother Subhankar was informed of his death on March 27; the family is unaware of when his body will reach them. 
 
  Goa-based National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR), where Suvojit was employed, said in a release: “He met with an accident during convoy operations at Ice Shelf and suffered major trauma late March 26. He was immediately rushed towards the expedition vessel and doctors joined with medical help. Unfortunately, attempts to revive him went in vain.” 
 
 The convoy operation was heading from the Indian Research Base, Maitri, to Ice Shelf, a distance of approximately 80 km. 
 
 Subhankar finally told father Dilip Sen and mother Mukta of Suvojit’s death on Thursday. They were shell-shocked and unable to speak when TOI visited their home in Purulia’s Dulmi-Nadhia locality. 
 
 Suvojit graduated from JK College in Purulia. His outstanding Geology scores in 2014 helped him get into IIT Bhubaneswar for his Masters.
 
 Suvojit applied for the 37th ISEA project last year and was selected. He left home on October 19, 2017.
 
 Subhankar said: “Suvojit would call us from Antartica regularly and tell us of his experiences amid ice and snow. He was very happy with his work and the opportunity to have a unique experience so early in his career. Suvojit was staying with his colleagues at a base camp named Maitri. He would tell us it felt like being in a completely different world.” 
 
 The family said that during his last call on March 24, Suvojit said his project was nearing completion and that he would be returning home before his 24th birthday on April 13 and be around for Subhankar’s wedding on April 26.
