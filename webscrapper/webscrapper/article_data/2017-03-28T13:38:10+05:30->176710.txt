Singer/songwriter   is convinced it was her destiny to make her   bow in 2017. 

 The 'Brave' singer will make her debut in the musical she co-wrote this week and she can't wait to sing the songs she penned for 'Waitress' in front of a live audience. 
 
 "I had originally thought that this year would get dedicated to making my next record, and I had gone into the songwriting process,"   says. 
 
 "And then when we got the news that   was moving on, I hadn't made a lot of headway with my own record yet and I was still sort of holding space for this show in a strange way. 
 
  
  
 "It just felt like this was the time. I'm as close to the show as I'll ever be. My friends are in the show. The band is the original band. Lots of things are still very similar to how it was created, and I feel like that's the show I want to be in." 
 
 Sara will play   in 'Waitress' until June 11.
