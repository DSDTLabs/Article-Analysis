PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor   on Friday welcomed the Madras high court’s order directing the   Grants Commission (UGC) and the Union human resources development (HRD) ministry to constitute a committee within three weeks for fixing the fee structure for   courses offered by the deemed universities in the Union territory of Puducherry.

 “The first bench of the Madras   (chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Abdul Quddhose) cracks the whip. Putting a system in place. Breaking a nexus and extortion of big money which was changing hands in medical seats (sic),” she said in a WhatsApp message while hailing the order.
 
 She also advised all medical aspirants to connect with advocate V B R Menon, who has filed a PIL in this regard, for further guidance.
 
 While directing the UGC and the HRD ministry to constitute a committee within three weeks to fix  , the first bench of the Madras high court on Thursday also passed an order that the constituted committee must submit its recommendations within four months of its constitution.
 
 In his petition, Menon charged that the deemed universities in Puducherry have been collecting exorbitant fees ranging from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 50 lakh per annum from students admitted under government quota as against the fees of Rs 5.5 lakh per annum fixed by the former committee.
