KOCHI: In an age when key issues and debates are often abandoned to keyboard warriors, a group of artists decided to leave the cosy zones of cyber space and travelled along the Nila to document waning communities and cultures.

 `Expressions', an exhibition-cum-sale of sketches made by the artists during the sojourn along the river, was inaugurated by the district collector on Wednesday . The project  , an initiative by a tourism group, was primarily aimed at raising funds for supporting traditional music teaching and learning.
 
 “Paava  , a matchless combination of puppet play and Kathakali, is unique to a community thriving in the banks of Nila. Likewise, there are Pulluvans, who sing traditional songs, potters and many more who are part of the river and its culture, and who will disappear with the river's death. Art Safari took shape as an attempt to save a river through art, by recording it and raising awareness about it through sketches and idiosyncratic documentations,“ said Gopinath Parayil, founder of  , a tourism travel company , which curated Art Safari.
 
 The sketches made by the artists during their three-day journey throw light on the various communities and their activities. The income generated from the sale of around 75 such sketches will be used to fund the  , a non-profit institution that teaches panchavadyam to aspiring students. “During Art Safari, we spent time to absorb the cultures, rituals and the way the craftsmen work, thus attempting to document life through sketches. It was an immersive and impelling experience to intermingle closely with people we knew nearly nothing about,“ said  , a business consultant and cartoonist based in Bengaluru.
 
 The exhibition will conclude by October 2.
