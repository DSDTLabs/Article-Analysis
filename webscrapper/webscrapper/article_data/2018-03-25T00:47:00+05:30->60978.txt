Jaipur: Heads of prominent Sufi shrines in India on Saturday rejected the idea of out of court settlement of Ram Mandir dispute and refused to become part of any such move.

 The head priests of these shrines, under the leadership of Dargah Dewan Syed Zainual Abedin Ali Khan, had participated in an annual meeting in Ajmer, in which they unanimously passed a resolution stating that out of court settlement of the dispute was neither desirable to the community nor feasible as the case was in Supreme Court.
 
 The meeting was held on the sidelines of the annual Urs in Ajmer Dargah.
 
 The stand of Sufi heads has come as a setback for Sri Sri Ravi Shankar who has been repeatedly calling on social and religious leaders of the Muslim community to join the movement for an out of court settlement.
 
 During the meeting, Dewan had asked participants to spread the message among followers to strictly follow the Supreme Court decision on the dispute. “We live in a democratic country where judiciary is the supreme body. I want to assure the political leadership and people of this country that Muslims will gracefully accept the judgment,” said Dewan.
 
 He warned people against dubious socio-religious leaders spreading hate by giving statements despite the matter being sub judice. “Those threatening wide spread riots in case the decision goes against them are the real enemies of India. They want to escalate the situation by playing with the sentiments of the people,” said Dewan.
 
 He reiterated the dispute was a matter of faith for both religions.
 
 BOX: Syed Naseeruddin is new Dewan
 
 Dargah Dewan Syed Zainual Abedin Ali Khan appointed his eldest son, Syed Naseeruddin Ali Khan, as his religious and legal heir on Saturday.
