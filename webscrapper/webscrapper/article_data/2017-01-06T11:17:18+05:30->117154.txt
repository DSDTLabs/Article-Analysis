YAMUNAGAR: Denying the   from a person in the  , speaker   termed it as an attempt to tarnish his image. Gujjar, who has recently returned from a foreign tour, addressed the media at his residence in   on Thursday to counter the allegations that one person had committed suicide last week after paying him a bribe of Rs 45 lakh in the Haryana assembly.

 Baljit Singh of Saha Kamleshpur village in Ambala district had killed himself and Ramnath of Naraingarh town was arrested on December 31, 2016, after the family of the deceased pointed to his role. While Ramnath was sent to jail, he appeared in a video that went viral on the social media in which he had alleged that he had accepted the money on the speaker’s behalf in the state assembly.
 
 Vehemently denying the allegations, Gujjar said, “This is a cooked up story in an attempt to tarnish my image. I was not in India when the incident occurred. Secondly, the person claimed to bring Rs 45 lakh in cash in the assembly premises. Is it possible to bring a bag with so much cash to the assembly past so many security checks? Above all, the names of 15 youths that allegedly paid the bribe of Rs 90 lakh for various jobs in Haryana assembly are not even among the applicants.”
 
 “This video is a well-planned exercise to damage my reputation. A thorough inquiry will expose those backing Ramnath,” said the speaker.
