NAVI MUMBAI: Cidco floated fresh tenders on Wednesday to appoint two parties to execute and complete the task of building 11 stations on line 1 of the ongoing metro connectivity for the 11.1-km run from Belapur suburban railway station to Pendhar. The bid documents went up for sale on Thursday. 

 Work of completing the station building has been delayed by over two years by the two agencies whose contract was terminated. This has also led to postponing the maiden metro run by almost a year. Initially, the project was supposed to be flagged off in July this year, Cidco sources said. Now, the maiden metro run will be possible only in May 2018.
 
  The bids will be finalized in about two months and the new agencies will be given until December 2017 to complete work, a Cidco official said. Around 40% of the work remains to be completed for the 11 stations. 
 
  The first six stations involve work of Rs 85 crore, while Rs 56 crore will be spent on the other five, totalling Rs 141 crore out of the Rs 321 crore apportioned for the Rs 3,043-crore line 1 of the ongoing project. 
 
 Cidco sources said that the new tender floated for Rs 141 crore includes a few crores of new work.
 
 Cidco terminated the contract of consortium - Sanjose (Spain),   and Infrastructure (Navi Mumbai) and   (Mumbai) - that had won the Rs 321-crore bid to construct the 11 stations. After reviewing and making an assessment of their work, managing director of Cidco, Bhushan Gagrani, found it tardy and lagging behind schedule. 
 
  A notice was served to them in January. TOI was the first to report the possibility of contracts being terminated.
