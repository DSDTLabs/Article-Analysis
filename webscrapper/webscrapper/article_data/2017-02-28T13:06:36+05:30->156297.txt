  1. 
 . Give them a   day and opt for a different footwear so that they can rest and breath and be ready for tough day’s battle ahead.
  
  2. 
 . Invest in a good shoe closet so that they stay longer and aren’t affected by outside elements.
  
  3.
 . Driving in high heels is a sure way to damage your shoes as the pressure on your heels from driving can cause heels or shanks to break. Wear a flipflops while driving car.
  
  4. 
 . Sweep a condition polish over your leather shoes from time to time using a soft cloth. And keep your suede pairs fresh with a stiff shoe brush. Use a suede eraser to rub away any dried dirt or stains.
