AHMEDABAD: A bank manager approached the cyber cell of the   with an oral complaint about   by a  .

  What surprised the cops was that the bank manager — who is supposed to be more aware of the risks of online transactions then a customer—gave the fraudsters the one-time password ( ).
 
 The blunder cost the bank manager Rs 35,000, which the fraudster withdrew from his account. 
 
 “The bank manager was so embarrassed that he declined to lodge a written complaint with the cyber cell and instead urged that his case be probed off the record,” said a senior cyber cell official .
 
 The cyber cell officials said although they could not probe oral complaints, they would keep a tab on the number from which the bank manager was called by the cheat.
 
 “Last week, a bank manager approached the cyber cell. He was first hesitant, but later he spoke. He said that he had got a call saying that his debit card would be blocked and he should provide the OTP to the caller to avoid further inconvenience. He gave away the OTP only to receive a message from the bank about the withdrawal of money from his account,” the official said. 
 
 “It is surprising that despite several incidents being reported in newspapers, people still give away their card numbers and OTPs. In this case it was a bank manager, who is supposed to be aware about online transactions. However, he committed such a blunder. We have traced the number to Jharkhand. There is a strong possibility that  , the kingpin of an online cheating racket, is involved in this case,” the official added.
