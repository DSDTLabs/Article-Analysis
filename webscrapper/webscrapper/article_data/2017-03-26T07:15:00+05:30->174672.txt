 The heads of the associations, who met at  , an  , on Saturday decided to hold a campaign to bring pressure on the government for proper implement of RTE in Kannada medium schools. 
 
 Renny D’Souza, director, Padi, explaining about various problems told STOI that currently the government is providing just Rs 12,000 annually for maintenance of a school which is insufficient. “We want the government to increase the amount to Rs 50,000 for lower primary, Rs 1 lakh for higher primary and Rs 1.5 lakh for model schools.”
 
 Acute shortage of teachers is another lacunae that government schools are battling within Karnataka. According to RTE norms, there should be two teachers for every 62 students. However there are many schools which do not have teachers as per the norms .
 
 In order to put pressure on the government to address these issues on priority, a campaign will be organised across Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts. 
 
 Members of School Development and Monitoring Committees and like-minded organisations will conduct meetings and submit a memorandum to local elected representative seeking fulfilment of the demands.
