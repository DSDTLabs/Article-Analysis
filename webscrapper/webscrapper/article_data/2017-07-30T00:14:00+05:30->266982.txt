Pune: The Pune Cantonment Board would resume collecting the vehicle entry tax soon after the Union ministry of finance issued a fresh directive on July 27, a senior defence official told TOI on Saturday.

 The official said, “The finance ministry in its fresh guideline mentioned that the   (vehicle entry tax) had been exempted from the GST and so the board could collect the tax. The chief executive officers (CEOs) of the cantonment boards will have to implement the guideline in their jurisdictions.”
 
 Post-implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST), the Pune Cantonment Board ( ) had stopped the collection of VET.
 
 Confirming the development, PCB CEO D N Yadav said, “We have called a special general body meeting on Monday. This agenda will be discussed in details in the meeting and the decision regarding the VET will be taken unanimously.”
 
 According to the DEO, the PCB generates about Rs 10.5 crore from the VET annually. “If we can reintroduce VET, it will be a big respite for us because we can then come up with new development plans,” Yadav added.
 
 A delegation led by PCB vice-president Atul Gaikwad and some of the board members had gone to Delhi to discuss the matter with the minister of state for defence, Subhash Bhamre, and Director General of Defence Estate (DGDE) in the recent past. The delegation had explained the board’s financial losses and requested the authorities to allow them collect the VET.
 
 Gaikwad said, “Since the VET collection was imperative for the board, we had to follow-up the matter with the higher-ups, including the ministry. Finally, they have agreed to our request, which is a very positive development for us because the board will be having adequate finance in the future.”
 
 The PCB had awarded the contract to a private agency to collect the VET. The CEO said the same agency would continue to collect the tax in the cantonment area.
