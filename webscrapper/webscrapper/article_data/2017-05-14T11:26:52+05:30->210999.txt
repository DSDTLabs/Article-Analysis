NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old man allegedly   his   to death following an argument and then tried to commit suicide at her house in   on Saturday afternoon. 

 The accused, Anil, is battling for his life in hospital. Police said he wanted to implicate his uncle, Bake Lal, in the   case. 
 
 Anil called the cops around 1pm, saying that he was stabbed by his uncle. The victim’s children, who witnessed the entire episode, said he stabbed himself in his throat after calling the police. 
 
 When cops reached the house in Tekhand village near the   area, they found the woman, Sita (30), unconscious while Anil was gasping for breath. Cowering in fear, her two daughters—aged six and four—were sitting on a bed. 
 
 Sita and Anil were rushed to an ESI hospital nearby, where Sita was declared dead on arrival. She had several stab injuries on the right side of her abdomen, while Anil had a single stab on his throat. Police found a kitchen knife on the spot.
 
 “It was found that Anil had an illicit affair with Sita but their families did not approve of it. On Saturday, the two got into an argument and Anil murdered her in a fit of rage,” said Romil Baaniya, deputy commissioner of police (southeast).
 
 Police said Sita had been avoiding Anil after Bake Lal, a labourer at an Okhla factor, got wind of their affair. On Saturday, Anil had gone to their house to sort out the matter once and for all. Anil too worked at the same factory as Bake Lal. 
 
 Police said that Sita’s body was sent for an autopsy while Anil has been shifted to AIIMS where his condition was said to be critical. They are questioning Bake Lal in connection with this case. 
 
 Police will counsel the children before recording their statements.
