A train to Pune is still at least one more Budget away, if not many more.

  in Nashik were left dejected as their expectations of   to Pune have been left in the lurch. Plans of laying rail tracks between the two cities would mean lesser travel time by rail. 
 
 For decades, the face of the Nashik Road railway station has remained unaltered, except during the Kumbh Mela when the state government funded the construction of platform number four. “That construction was also done by the Kumbh funds, but the infrastructure is lying unused because the Railways is not using it. Had they started a weekly train from the station the funds spent would have seen justice,” exclaimed Ragini Deore, a railway commuter from Nashik.
 
 Deore is among the many commuters from Nashik who often travels to Hyderabad to meet her parents.
 
 The construction work of escalators and elevators at Nashik Road, announced a year ago is still going on. “Though it is happening now, it has nothing to do with the  . The pace of development is slow here. The Railways needs to show signs of earnestness for the Nashik Road station,” said Rahul Sonawane, a frequent commuter.
 
 “Just imagine a village like Nagarsul in Yeola taluka is a terminus for railways coming from Balaji, but Nashik has no stop,” Sonawane pointed out.
 
 The withdrawal of service charge from e-tickets comes as a relief to passengers though. “It is a good thing that the commuters who wish to use the online service to book tickets will be exempted from the service charge. As the government has to go an extra mile to forbid the financial institutions or the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation for charging heavily on bookings under garb of transactions charges, fixed charges and convenience charges,” said Shailesh Patel, another commuter.
