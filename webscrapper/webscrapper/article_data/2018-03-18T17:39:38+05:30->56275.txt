 Nidahas Trophy Final - India vs Bangladesh
 
 March 18, 2018
 
 R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo
 
 7:00 pm(IST)
 
 
 India had the better of Bangladesh in the previous encounter of the Nidahas Trophy. However, following their dramatic win against Sri Lanka where tempers flew and the Bangladesh dressing room was vandalised, Shakib Al Hasan's team looks different, and one that is high on confidence and believe it can finally open their account against India in T20Is.
 
 The established names of Bangladesh cricket will be put to test against a formidable Indian outfit, which hasn't looked back following the loss to Sri Lanka in the tournament opener. Since, they have registered three wins to seal passage to Sunday's summit clash, with youngsters exuding promise in the absence of some of their biggest names.
 
 Will Bangladesh get the better of their Asian counterparts or will India add to their glorious run in limited-overs format? The question will be answered today evening.
