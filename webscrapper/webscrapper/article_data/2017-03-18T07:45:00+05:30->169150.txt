LUDHIANA: Here is some good news for the industrial hub. The city that is gasping for breath will soon get green lungs, with the municipal corporation increasing its green cover by 15% every year. 

 The MC officials have started collecting satellite images of the city to prepare a detailed project report as barren areas will be their prime focus. Under the Atal Mission Rejuvenation Urban Transmission (AMRUT) scheme, the Centre has allocated Rs 5 crore to the city for project that will culminate in 2020. 
 
 The Punjab   remote sensing centre’s images showed that the city has 143 square kilometre road network. “We will now zero in on the areas which lack green cover. For instance,   and   hardly have any trees,” said MC horticulture wing executive engineer Surinder Kumar.
 
 “More than 145km comes under MC limit. As it is difficult to check the status physically, we are taking the help of PAU remote sensing centre. After receiving the satellite images, we will visit the places,” Kumar added. 
 
 The Centre has also directed the MC to develop abandoned parks. “We have identified five such green belts:  , two on GT Road, one each in BRS Nagar and MC Zone B. From landscaping to lighting, all features will be upgraded,” another MC official said. 
 
 According to the forest department, Ludhiana district has 9,000 hectare of green cover, which makes only 1% of total geographical area. It includes public parks, roadside plantation, forest land and canal-side plantation. It does not include plantation in private areas. 
 
 In 2015, Punjab Agricultural University former assistant professor and PWD department sub-divisional engineer (horticulture)   had done a research on tree shade in the city. “The city has 160 square kilometre area under tree cover, which means 9.1% of its total area. Only 2% of green cover comprises parks and roadside plants. The remaining 7.1% has been developed by residents and institutions,” said Bhardwaj.
