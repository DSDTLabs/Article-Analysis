KOLKATA: The   on Friday raided shops selling packaged drinking water a day after mayor Sovan Chatterjee put the blame of water contamination on bottled water.

 A team from the health department first reached the Ranikuthi area and found that a retailer of packaged drinking water was selling bottles without the mandatory Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) mark. The officials picked up some samples and warned the businessman against selling spurious water.
 
  
 The team then went to Bagha Jatin, the epicentre of the enteric disease, where they found a shop selling bottled water without seals or manufacturing dates. The trader was cautioned and a bottle was seized for testing. The civic team went around the enteric-affected zones, including Santoshpur, Patuli, Mukundapur and Garia and spotted several shops where packaged drinking water was being sold without following FSSAI norms.
 
 The civic team members then encountered a group of staffers from an illegal bottled-water manufacturing unit at Laskarhat in  . These employees confronted the officials and then locked the factory and ran away.
 
 Atin Ghosh, member, mayor-in-council overseeing the health department, conceded that it was difficult for his team to keep an eye on the illegal trade across the city. “We will write to the FSSAI authorities and the state enforcement branch to conduct raids on unauthorized manufacturing units,” Ghosh said.
