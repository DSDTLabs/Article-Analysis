Trichy: Apprehending threat to the survival of Uyyakondan canal, the district administration has decided to resume the monthly meeting of the Uyyakondan protection committee from next month. The canal has been serving as a carrier of the city’s liquid as well as solid waste though it was supposed to be an irrigation canal. It has been over six months since the stakeholders and environmentalists met to discuss the status of the canal and improve its environment.  According to environmentalists, ever since the inflow from Mettur dam dwindled to 500 cusecs a couple of weeks ago, only drainage and sullage from residential and commercial establishments had been filling the 1,000-year-old canal. Meanwhile, a study conducted by the environmental NGO, Thanneer on February 18 revealed that around eight spots along the banks were heavily polluted and that sewage and sullage were gushing to the canal through PVC pipes from households. The study was done along the route of flow of the canal within the city limits spanning 8kms.  One of the reasons cited for the poor upkeep of the canal was the absence of coordination among the various departments and entities dealing with the canal which include the city corporation, PWD, revenue department and social activists. It is pointed out that the monthly meeting of the Uyyakondan protection committee attended by all stakeholder departments since July last year has been a farce. TOI had highlighted the prolonged delay in convening the meeting to discuss the development of Uyyakondan canal on February 19 in a report titled, “With no review meeting yet, Uyyakondan has no way out”. It was also reported that the district administration, taking cognizance of the report, recently took steps to resume the monthly meeting. “As per the instructions of district collector, we have been making arrangements for hosting the Uyyakondan protection committee meet from next month,” a senior official with district administration said.
