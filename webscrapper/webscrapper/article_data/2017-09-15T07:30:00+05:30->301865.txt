Chandigarh: Looking for a pair of new shoes or a jacket? Or an online PhD course? Log on to Chandigarh education department’s website, which has links to various government schools’ websites that will take you to online shopping portals.

 When the world is embracing digitisation, the education department has an embarrassing feat to share.
 
  Some links will also take you to websites of mining tools and Chinese machinery products, besides online courses. 
 
 Others will take you to pages with texts in foreign languages. Most of the 114 schools are not accessible digitally. None shows Indian content. 
 
 Besides, there are 27 schools that are yet to get a website.
 
 It also points to the fact that schools and the education department are not using the websites, which is why they did not notice the blunder.
 
 Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, school education, said, “This is not possible. There might be a technical error. I will get it checked by our IT team. I will fix the responsibility and get it updated at the earliest.”
 
 Chandigarh Parents’ Association president Nitin Goyal said, “This shows the education department’s neglect. Private schools take advantage of such things.”
