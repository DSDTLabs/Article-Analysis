BHAGALPUR: District and sessions judge   on Saturday rejected the anticipatory bail petition of Arijit Shashwat, the son of Union minister   

 Shashwat is named in an FIR (176/18) lodged with Nathnagar police station under sections 147, 148, 149, 188, 353, 153A and 295A of Indian Penal Code besides 3(d) of Loudspeaker Act for leading a procession on March 17 without any written permission from the district administration and playing provocative songs that resulted in violent group clashes in the Muslim-dominated locality. The procession was organized to celebrate the first day of the new Vikram Samvat. The case was lodged on the written complaint by sub-inspector   of Nathnagar police station.
 
 The court did not decide on the anticipatory bail petitions of other accused, namely Abhay Kumar Ghosh, Dev Kumar Pandey, Anup Lal Sah, Pranav Sah, Pramod Verma, Niranjan Singh, Sanjay Singh and Surendra Pathak.
 
 Advocate Biresh Kumar Mishra, who represented Shashwat, pleaded before the court that it was a “fabricated case” lodged against his client whereas public prosecutor (PP)   Prasad Sah said there were serious charges against Shashwat, who is accused of raising slogans with serious communal overtones that vitiated the social and communal harmony in the town. 
 
 The CJM court, on March 24, issued a warrant of arrest against Shashwat and eight other accused on Nathnagar SHO Md Janifuddin’s plea. PP Satyanarayan told this newspaper that the bail petitions of other accused had been kept pending by the court. Mishra, on the other, said Shashwat would move the Patna high court to seek bail.
