MUMBAI: NM Joshi Marg police on Thursday grilled Nagpur businessman Duke (Yug) Tulli for nearly four hours in connection with the illegal construction in Mojo’s Bistro as well in connection with the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act.

 Police on Wednesday had questioned   owners Ramesh Govani and Yug Pathak. Pathak is the son of former Pune police commissioner K K Pathak. “We questioned Govani and Yug in the MRTP case and have got enough information on what illegalities were carried by the 1Above and Mojo’s Bistro but we need to corroborate it with the three absconding partners of 1Above.” police said.
 
 Tulli, a director of Mojo’s Bistro, was booked on Sunday after BMC registered three FIRs under the MRTP Act. Police had also booked Govani for allowing illegalities to be carried out by his tenants, Mojo’s Bistro, 1Above and P22.
 
 Police, probing the 1Above fire in which 14 people lost their lives last week, are awaiting fire brigade reports on the cause of the fire. The three partners of 1Above (Krispesh Sanghvi, Jigar Sanghvi and Abhjit Mankar), who were booked under various sections for negligence and causing death, are on run. Police have also issued a lookout circular (LOC) against the absconding accused.
