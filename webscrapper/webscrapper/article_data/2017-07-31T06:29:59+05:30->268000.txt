NEW DELHI: Senior JD(U) leader   seems defiant with his party boss and Bihar chief minister  . Even as his party is in alliance with   now, Yadav lashed out at the Centre and tweeted, “Neither black money slashed abroad returned, one of the main slogans of the ruling party nor anyone caught out of those named in  .”

 Yadav’s sharp reaction reflects that he is not on the same page with Nitish, who has not only endorsed several of the Centre’s policies against corruption including demonetisation but has gone on to form government with BJP and the two have dubbed the reunion a crusade against corruption.
 
 However, Yadav’s remarks imply that the Centre has failed to take steps towards containing corruption.
 
 He reacted on a day when RJD boss   urged Yadav to hands with him as the two leaders had fought several battles together and should reunite again.
 
 Yadav had made his displeasure over the BJP-JD (U) alliance known and had become the rallying point for dissidents in the party even as Nitish and other leaders downplayed the remarks.
 
 JD(U)'s   MPs Veerendra Kumar and Ali Anwar, who had openly criticised Nitish’s move to break away from the grand alliance, had met Yadav in Delhi.
