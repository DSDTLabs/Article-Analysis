 Bajrang Dal, Kashi Prant, organised a convention for its members at the Magh Mela ground in Allahabad on Monday. 
 
 Regional organizational secretary of Bajrang Dal, Ambrish Singh, said, “The organisation was formed during the Ram Janam Bhoomi movement in 1984 and following that, volunteers of the saffron outfit have contributed to various other movements like ‘gau raksha‘, conservation of Ganga and ‘love jihad’.”
 
 Singh added that the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections was a wake up call for volunteers to elect a such government which would rise above nepotism, caste and religion and take the cause of the Ram temple forward. 
 
 “Though the matter is pending in court but the issue is related to faith of millions of Hindus. The central government must introduce a bill in Parliament as this would help to maintain peace and harmony,” said a   member on condition of anonymity. 
 
 Regional convener of Bajrang Dal, Surendra, said, “Volunteers should work hard to create awareness among masses for the construction of Ram temple.”
