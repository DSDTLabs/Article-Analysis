 The state government has passed a bill seeking exemption from conducting NEET for students at  . "The standard of syllabus and variation in performances varies in each system, paving way for wide variation in marks obtained by students ," it said.
 
 Since the cost is borne by the respective state governments, fee in state government medical colleges is far below than private medical colleges and therefore introducing uniform entrance examination will deprive role of the states which does not augur will in a federal set-up. "The government cannot afford to thrust uniformity on a country which has wide regional, economic and linguistic disparities," he added.
