NOIDA: Complaining of heavy power cuts ranging between three to five hours each day over last one week, Noida’s entrepreneurs claimed, they have lost 50% of their manufacturing capacity over a week due to random load shedding.

 “Power-cuts during day time has a drastic impact on industrial productivity as that is our main manufacturing cycle. Noida is supposed to be a no power cut zone for at least the industrial sectors. But this issue has not been resolved till date. We have been receiving complaints from entrepreneurs for last several days. Some have even claimed that their productivity has dwindled to around 50% over last week,” Vipin Kumar Malhan, president,   (NEA), said.
 
 In reaction to the complaints made by the manufacturers, Mukul Singhal, Superintendent Engineer, NPCL,   said that though there were major faults after a recent storm, repairs were effectively carried out soon after in all sector to bridge power supply issues.
 
 “In case any individual factory owner or entrepreneur is facing power cuts, they should immediately report it with us and the matter will be addressed,” Singhal told TOI.
 
 “Power cuts and load shedding during summer is a major problem for Noida’s industries. We seek the state government’s attention in this regard,”Malhan added.
 
 However, Singhal further stated that the quality of power supply situation, especially to the industrial sector has improved this year over last year.
