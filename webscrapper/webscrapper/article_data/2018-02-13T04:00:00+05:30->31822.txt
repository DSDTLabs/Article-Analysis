Vadodara: If members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student outfit backed by the BJP, are to be believed celebrating days like chocolate day, rose day, executive day among others goes against Indian culture. 

 On Monday, a group of around 20 ABVP supporters staged a protest at MSU’s Faculty of Arts against celebrations of such days at the campus. 
 
 In fact, the group also entered into heated arguments with other student leaders resulting into anxious moments at the campus as MSU’s vigilance staff and police rushed to the spot to intervene. 
 
 ABVP made a representation before professor Sanjay Karandikar, dean of students at the faculty asking the faculty officials to put a halt on such celebrations. 
 
 At a time when not just the Faculty of Arts but the entire MSU campus is buzzing with such day celebrations, the faculty officials have naturally not paid any heed to such demands made by the ABVP. 
 
 Jayprakash Jha, campus president of ABVP Vadodara argued that such celebrations went against the “vision” of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. “Have we heard of such fancy days being celebrated at Oxford or Harvard? Such days are not even part of western culture. But since a fortnight such days are being celebrated instead of focusing on overall development. This is affecting our ‘sanskruti’ (culture),” he said. 
 
 “We have informed them that such celebrations are not affecting academics in any way. We cannot stop such celebrations which are popular among generation next,” Karandikar told TOI, adding that the group had objected especially to celebrations like “rose day” and “teddy bear day”.
