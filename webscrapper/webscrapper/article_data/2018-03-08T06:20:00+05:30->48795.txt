NOIDA: Five bikes and a scooter were damaged after a fire broke out in the meter room in the basement at   in   of Sector 49. The builder’s office was also located in the basement.

 Three fire tenders arrived at the spot and took an hour to douse the flames.
 
 According to fire department officers, the fire was caused by a short circuit due to an overload in the meter room of the basement.
 
 “The basement has suffered a lot of damage and six vehicles belonging to residents were burnt. Out of these vehicles, four bikes were damaged completely. Thankfully, there was no loss of life,” Kuldeep Kumar, fire safety officer I, told TOI.
 
 The fire started on Wednesday morning but was noticed only around 9.30 am when a resident saw fumes billowing from the basement of the building. While people were in the office at that time they managed to escape to safety.
 
 Meanwhile, in Greater Noida’s Salempur village, a Swift Dzire (UP16AP 4569) owned by one Mamchand caught fire while it was moving on the link road of the village.
 
 “The car’s engine suddenly caught fire. Mamchand, his wife and two children stepped out of the car and screamed for help. The passersby came to help and pushed the car in the canal nearby,” an eye-witness said.
