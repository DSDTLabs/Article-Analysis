LUCKNOW: A day after the results of the   were declared, the axe fell on those MLAs who violated the party line to vote support a rival party.

 BSP supremo Mayawati suspended MLA Anil Singh from the party after he voted for BJP. Singh had met chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday night and later said he would vote in favour of Maharaj (Yogi). 
  
 
 
 “He did it for business gains and because of that he has been suspended,” she said. BSP’s candidate received only 32 votes and lost to BJP on the basis of second preferential votes.
 
 NISHAD Party also expelled its Gyanpur MLA Vijay Mishra for cross-voting in favour of BJP. The party had tied up with SP for the recent Gorakhpur bypolls with the latter having fielded  , party president Sanjay Nishad’s son as its candidate. He defeated BJP with nearly 20,000 votes.
 
 Mishra’s expulsion was announced by the party president in Gorakhpur on Saturday. “Our party practices politics based on ethics and ideology and will not tolerate those who deceive .” he said.
 
 Nishad said this incident would not affect his party’s relations with SP.
 
 Meanwhile, chief of BJP’s ally Suheldev   Party   confirmed that a show-cause notice has been served to MLAs   and Triveni Ram following reports that they voted against BJP.
 
 “Both will be expelled from the party if charges are found to be true,” he told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Mayawati, on the other hand, praised him for listening to his voice of conscience. “Sonkar, who is associated with the Dalit community, heard the voice of his conscience and voted against BJP’s anti-Dalit policies and for that we thank him. If he is harassed by this government, we will stand by him,” she said.
 
 Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Ajit Singh also expelled his party’s lone MLA in the UP Assembly Sahender Singh Chauhan, for cross-voting. Chaudhan voted in favour of BJP even after his party had declared support for BSP.
