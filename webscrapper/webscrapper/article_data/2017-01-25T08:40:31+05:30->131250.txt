PUNE: On Tuesday, parents of students at the   in   were in for a rude shock — the management told them not to send their children to the institution from Wednesday. 

 Late last week, the   Fergusson College Road branch too downed its shutters.
 
 Worried parents now feel cheated by this sudden decision, which was relayed when the parents came to pick up their kids after school. Others were informed over the phone. “This branch has been in trouble for the last three or four months, but the management did assure us that things would be sorted out eventually. We never expected this,” said one shocked parent.
 
 Another parent, a working mom, is at her wit’s end. “I had paid Rs 30,000 in fees here, and I will now have to pay another school so my child can complete this year. Apart from losing money, we’re under so much stress,” she said.
 
 Rajesh Bhatia, TreeHouse managing director, claimed ignorance when TOI got in touch with him. “I am unaware about this shut down. However, parents should not panic. I will definitely look into this matter and take corrective steps,” he said.
