Sunday’s clash between table-toppers   and   at the MCA Stadium here presents an opportunity for the MS Dhoni-led outfit to turn things around after losing their last match against Rajasthan Royals on Thursday night.

 
 While a win from their remaining three league games should be enough to hand them a playoffs berth, CSK - with 14 points from 11 matches - will want to win all to give them the best possible chance of a top-2 finish. SRH, on the other hand, will surely finish top-two if they win on Sunday. They lost their first match to CSK at home and given the fact that they might face Dhoni’s men again in the play-offs, it’s crucial that the Hyderabad side wins on Sunday so that they have the momentum running in their favour going into the business end.
