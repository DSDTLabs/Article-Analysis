SURAT: The Employees’   Organization’s (EPFO) regional office raided more than 30 industrial units in and around the city and the district in the past one week as a part of its ongoing provident fund (PF) enrolment campaign-2017 and found that around 1,350 workers had been deprived of their provident fund (PF) benefits. 

 These employees too were later enrolled under the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act under the ongoing campaign launched on January 1, 2017 and scheduled to continue until March 31, 2017. 
 
 The economic powerhouse of Gujarat employs over 15 lakh workers in diamond and textile sectors, but the workforce is not getting their PF dues. EPFO records show that the diamond industry has less than 40,000 workers against the total workforce of 5 lakh and the textile industry less than 60,000 workers against the total workforce of 10 lakh to be covered under Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act. Looking at this scenario, the regional office of the EPFO decided to act tough against companies that violate the EPF & MP Act.
 
 Under the scheme, any employer can make a declaration regarding enrolment of his employees from April 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016. The employer is liable to pay only employer’s share of provident fund along with simple interest at the rate of 12 per cent. For such employees whose PF was not deducted by the employers, they are not required to pay employees share. The EPF & MP Act applies to any notified establishment employing 20 or more employees. 
 
 Also, the penalty for late payment which usually ranges between 5 per cent and 100 per cent is reduced to a nominal Re1 per annum in respect of such employees and administrative charges abolished. 
 
 “It’s like the   (IDS). The employers have been given a fair chance to come into the system till March 31, 2017, otherwise be prepared to face music after the date is over,” regional provident fund commissioner   said.
