HYDERABAD: The ‘no-cash’ boards that greeted the city for months after demonetisation in November 2016 are back, forcing citizens to go in circles with hundreds of ATMs running dry.

  Dejected people are greeted with ‘no cash’ at HDFC, Andhra Bank, ICICI and  . “The cash is loaded at 2 pm and it gets over within one hour. People are seething with rage ,” said a security guard at an ICICI ATM in Khairatabad. As complaints are pouring in from everywhere, Shivaani Sen, a model and compere, said: “Looks like ATMs would be discarded and people will queue up at banks for money. More smartphones would be sold purely because Paytm is fast becoming the new currency.”
