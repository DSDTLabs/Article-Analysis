HYDERABAD: You might not have the habit, but even ‘secondhand smoking’ can take a toll on your heart. According to doctors, passive smokers have a 25-30% added risk of developing heart diseases.

 
 This World No Tobacco Day, doctors point out how tobacco is a major risk factor for strokes, coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases but awareness on this fact continues to be low among city’s population.
 
 
  
 
 Dr  , consultant pulmonologist at KIMS hospital in   pointed out how quitting smoking can cut down risk of heart diseases.
 
 “Even passive smokers have a 25 to 30% added risk of developing heart diseases, second-hand smoke also increases risk of strokes by 25 to 30%. Smokers should aim to quit instead of cutting down, since even one cigarrete a day brings added risks of strokes and heart diseases. Within three months of quitting smoking, your heart attack risk begins to drop and lung function begins to improve. After one year, the added risk of coronary heart disease becomes half of that of a smoker’s,” said Dr Sharma.
 
 Other doctors pointed out that although awareness is being spread about the ill-effects of smoking, this is not the case with chewing tobacco or smokeless tobacco which is being consumed on a massive scale among the rural pockets of Hyderabad.
 
 “While in urban areas , smoking is causing cancers among young adults, chewing tobacco continues to be a rampant and overlooked problem across rural areas. Since there is no ban on chewing tobacco in public and not many government interventions have been made in this regard, awareness about the ill effects of chewing tobacco continues to be low,” said Dr  , consultant head and neck oncologist at   in Hyderabad.
