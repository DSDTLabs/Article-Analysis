PANAJI: A former sarpanch, Tony Fernandes, and chairman of minority department of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee, Urfan Mulla, are among the probable candidates shortlisted by Congress in its battle to fend off any threat to its bastion the   assembly constituency.

 Fernandes, who started his political career as a panch in Santa Cruz panchayat in 2002, functioned as the leader of opposition in the body. On being re-elected in 2007, he became deputy sarpanch and later sarpanch in 2012. 
 
 A panch in Santa Cruz panchayat headed by his wife Indira, Fernandes is in the title race along with Mulla, Mahila Congress general secretary Helena Domingos Lourenco and former zilla panchayat member Kishore Narvekar.
 
 Former Congress MLA Victoria Fernandes, who had been elected as an independent in 1994 and on a ticket from Goan People’s Congress Party in 1999, had retained the seat for Congress in 2002 as well as in2007. Expelled Congress MLA  , who held the fort since 2012, has decided to shift to Panaji segment.
 
 Congress also faced a major challenge from Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) in the 2012 elections. This time, a resurgent MGP has nominated Merces sarpanch   for the seat while BJP is likely to make a choice between party vice-president and veteran politician  , and a greenhorn, Hemant Golatkar.
 
 AAP was the first political party to announce its candidate Joe Gomes for this constituency, comprising the villages of Santa Cruz, Merces and Chimbel.
 
 A clear picture will emerge soon as to who will be in the race to fill the vacuum caused by Monserrate’s possible shift to the capital city. In 2012, Monserrate had polled 8,644 votes; independent candidate Rodolfo Fernandes had bagged 6,308 votes and MGP candidate Dinar Tarcar had gathered 5,824 votes.
