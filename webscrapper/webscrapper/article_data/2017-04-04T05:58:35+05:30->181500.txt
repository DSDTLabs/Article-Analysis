AHMEDABAD:  's higher   issued an order last week, to shut down   in Kalupur. Soon after the order was issued, the management laid off 14 faculty members of the institute. Currently, more than 1,500 students are studying in the institute. The issue dates back to 2010 when a female faculty member at the institute alleged sexual harassment by some male faculty members. While the police had arrested the accused within 24 hours of the complaint, they were not suspended from the institute. In the wake of the issue, recently, the higher education commissioner at the varsity had ordered it to be closed. 

 The students have been protesting the move as it is a grant-in-aid college and should not be shut. The issue, however, is complex as the powers to shut the college lies with the university only and the government is only empowered to cut the grant. GU has ordered to form a committee in the matter.
