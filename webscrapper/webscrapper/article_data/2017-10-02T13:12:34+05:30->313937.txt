ALWAR: A huge rush of tourists was witnessed at Sariska   in   when it opened on Sunday. 

 According to officials, about 800 tourists had visited the reserve till evening including some foreigners. However, tourists were disappointed at not sighting any tigers. 
 
 This year, for the first time, apart from the main gate, tourists were allowed entry through the Tehla Gate. This allowed tourists coming from Jaipur and   easy entry to the park, saving them from covering an additional 50 km towards the main gate. 
 
 The wildlife department has given special training to the nature guides and Gypsy drivers to keep a distance of 30 metres in case of sighting tiger or leopard for the safety of tourists. 
 
 According to officials, three canters and 17 Gypsy were pressed into service to cater to the demand of the tourists during Dussehra holidays. Rise in the number of tigers at   reserve increased the chances of tiger sighting drawing large number of wildlife lovers to the park. The officials expect the rush to continue for the next few days.
