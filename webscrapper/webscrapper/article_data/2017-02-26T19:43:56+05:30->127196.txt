The album starts with  , which makes for a good listen thanks to SP Balasubrahmanyam, who renders this with ease. The song is peppy, especially the beats, which become addictive after a point. Before you soak the retro feel, the song immediately switches over to rap by Emcee Gonzales and has parts of nadaswaram in between, giving it a whole different flavour. A well-composed song, this one! Nee Indri is a beautiful melody sung well by MM Manasi. This one, again, is very reminiscent of the 80s melodies ' feel-good, light and works perfect when you're on a long drive. The use of electric guitar portions in a melody need a mention. This one makes for another great listen. Innum Enna Solla is a combination of multiple sounds by Nivas, who captures the emotions of the boy-meets-girl moment. Rendered by Haricharan Seshadri featuring B Mac, the song's highlight are the different layers that the composer has tried to create in one song. But at the same time, it's a tad awkward, too. This one might not be catchy at first, but with visuals, it might work for the listener. Or Naal Kaadhal by Sathyaprakash Dharmar echoes a pathos feel of Enda Ippadi. The prominence is given to the voice as Nivas has kept the tune quite simple. Might work for the film's plot, but not for your playlist. Maatrangal Ondre Dhaan by   gives a 90s AR Rahman-feel. Giving a Bob Marley experience with the lines 'Don't Worry Be Happy', Nivas renders this with the right emotions. The motivational lyrics by Kabilan is worth a mention! The One theme by BV Balasai reverberates even after you stop listening, while The Happiness of Pursuit by   and BV Balasai, is beautiful instrumental version of Maatrangal!   has been consistently giving good soundtrack ever since he made his debut, and this one, too, doesn't disappoint!
