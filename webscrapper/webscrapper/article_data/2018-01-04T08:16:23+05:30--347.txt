GANDHINAGAR: Koli leader  , the minister of state (MoS) for fisheries, on Wednesday skipped the cabinet meeting and held a show of strength at his residence in Gandhinagar, calling his supporters to be present after he expressed dissatisfaction with the BJP high command on Tuesday, for not giving him a ‘significant’ portfolio.

 Solanki has decided intensify the pressure on the BJP government in the coming days. The Koli Samaj president, Kalu Dabhi, who stood in support of Solanki, said, “The   hasn’t got adequate representation in the government. The Koli community demands justice.   must get an important position in the cabinet. We hope the government will do us justice.”
 
 Former parliamentary secretary and the brother of Solanki, Hirabhai Solanki, said, “Parshottambhai must get good position in the cabinet considering his seniority. Every time he is given the same department. He must get a bigger responsibility to serve the people better. This is his fifth term as MLA.”
 
 On Tuesday, Solanki said, “I went to meet the CM to express my Koli community’s feeling about us being ignored. The community was expecting that as their leader, I would get a better portfolio and a better position in the government. I have been given only one portfolio, fisheries, while earlier I had two or more portfolios. The party has directly given cabinet rank to members elected only for the second time, why have I been ignored when this is my fifth term. My community’s feelings must be respected.”
 
 “My community influences more than 45 assembly seats and most of them are with BJP. This constant neglect will breach their trust. If this situation continues till 2019, my community may explore other options. This is the right time for the party to decide. If the CM can hold 12 departments, the deputy CM can hold many departments and other ministers can have more portfolios, our community feels that as their representative I have not got proper allocation of portfolios,” he said.
