Margao: After several missed deadlines, the under-construction   hospital in Margao has now got a fresh target for completion. 

 Health minister Vishwajit Rane and minister for town and country planning, Vijai Sardesai, during their visit to the site on Saturday to review the status of the work in progress, announced that the hospital would be operational in all respects within one year.
 
 Senior officials of the directorate of health services (DHS) and Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) were present at the time.
 
 With a view to ensuring that the “flagship project” of the DHS doesn’t miss another deadline, Rane said that a review meeting will be now held every month with the GSIDC and DHS.
 
 “We are focussing on completion of the building at the earliest. The monthly review meeting will ensure that progress of the work adheres to the work flowchart and provisions are made for procuring all diagnostic equipments required for the functioning of the hospital,” Rane told mediapersons even as he directed the health officials to ensure that the radiology department of the hospital be complete with all latest digital imaging facilities. 
 
 Rane also asked the director of health services, S Dalvi, to prepare a list of requisition of tools, equipments and staff for the new 500-bedded hospital. 
 
 Sardesai raised concerns over the seepage of ground water into the basement of the building and directed the GSIDC to take effective steps to resolve the problem at the earliest. He also stressed on the need for providing employment to the locals in the hospital, particularly the land losers. 
 
 The top two floors of the building have been planned to house a nursing college, Rane said.
