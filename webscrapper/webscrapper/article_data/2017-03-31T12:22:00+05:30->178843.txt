 Ishaan, a newbie makes his debut as the hero in the movie which is shot simultaneously in Kannada and Telugu. Music composed by Sunil Kashyap is enthralling. With a run time of 2 hours 10 minutes, the first half of   has nothing special to offer except for introducing the characters-   as a recovery agent, who becomes an auto driver for a particular reason.
