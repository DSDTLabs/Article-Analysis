Mysuru: Dubbing charges leveled by former minister and BJP leader   of a scam in the Ashraya Housing Committee ‘baseless’,   leader R Murthy on Friday said, “Ashraya houses were not distributed during MLA MK Somashekar’s tenure as an MLA, and all allegations made against the committee member Naseer are all false.”

 Murthy further added that Ramdas had no moral authority to speak about corruption, since many irregularities were reported in the Ashraya Committee when he was the minister. “Even to this day, people who were promised houses are yet to receive them. Ramdas sold thousands of application forms under the housing scheme project for Rs 100 each, and siphoned off crores of rupees. Let him first tell the public where this money has been deposited,” Murthy said.
 
 The Congress leader stated that the documents being furnished by Ramdas were fabricated since they did not have signatures of the committee president or other officials. Murthy called for an investigation to learn how Ramdas managed to obtain these documents, and to verify their authenticity.
 
 Meanwhile, member of the Mysuru City Corporation council Jagadish rubbished allegations of applying for a house in Krishnaraja constituency. “I am a voter in Chamundeshwari constituency, how can I apply for a house in KR segment. This shows how false the claims are,” Jagadish said.
