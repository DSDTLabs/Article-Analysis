LUCKNOW: UP Shia Central Waqf Board chairman,  , on Monday said that the opposition's notice for moving impeachment motion against CJI Dipak Misra was as an attempt by   to create obstructions in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute case and by supporting Muslim radicals, the Congress is hurting Hindu beliefs. 

 In a statement issued on Monday, Rizvi hailed the vice-president's rejection of the impeachment motion notice moved by opposition. Rizvi called it a favourable step for judiciary's freedom.
 
 "The motion was only an attempt to create pressure on CJI. Senior Congress politician and advocate, Kapil Sibal, had previously in court demanded that the Ayodhya case be heard after 2019. He had said that it is BJP's agenda to get Ram temple constructed but it was rejected by court," he said. 
 
 "In fact, it was the Congress which divided the country on Ram temple issue. They got locks of the disputed site opened in 1986," added Rizvi. 
 
 Rizvi has previously on several occasions supported the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. 
 
 He claims that the disputed land belongs to UP Shia Waqf Board and should be handed over to Board, which will then get Ram temple constructed. 
 
 He proposes construction of a new mosque, named Masjid-e-Aman (mosque of peace). in a Muslim-dominated area of Lucknow.
