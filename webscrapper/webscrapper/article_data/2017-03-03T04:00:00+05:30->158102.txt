Surat: It is risky to be seen anywhere close to the stray cattle because this can anger the cattle owners who have formed a strong network in the city and appointed a bevy of informers, too. The moment their informers see a cattle catching party of SMC approaching, they inform the cattle owners, who herd them back to the barn.  And if the cattle are caught, they don’t hesitate to attack the SMC party with stones and sticks and try to free the animals. A cattle catching party generally comprises 22 people, which include seven beldars, 15 marshals and the van driver. SMC authorities have demanded an SRP company because every month there are at least three cases of attack on a cattle catching party.  “The frequencies of the attacks are growing with every passing day. We need protection of armed policemen to do the job otherwise it is difficult to stand up to the hooligans,” said a member of the cattle catching party member.  “We need strong police protection because SMC marshals cannot save you from these violent cattle owners. SMC has decided to have a cattle catching team in every municipal zone,” said Praful Mehta, who is in-charge of SMC’s stray cattle catching department.  “ Under the provisions of Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act, it is the responsibility of the police to tackle the stray cattle menace in the city. The municipal corporation’s job is to take care of the impounded cattle,” Dr Mehta said. People’s views Twinkle Jariwala: “I am scared to ride my two-wheeler and go to my mother’s house from Nanpura where I live with my family. I am scared of cows on the road because there is every possibility of an accident because of them.”  Sonal Naik: “ I live in Vesu where stray cattle are a menace. I am always worried for my son who takes a scooter to tuition because of my bad experiences while riding a two-wheeler. Stray cattle must not be allowed on city roads.”
