Ahmedabad: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has appointed four deputy superintendent of police (DSP) level officers to probe 220 cheques amounting to Rs 102 crore found from Mansukh Shah's office. 

 The probe presently focuses on ascertaining why the cheques were procured and from whom. Most of the cheques don’t have dates, making it difficult to ascertain the time period, and name of the receiver. "The probe has established that the cheques were demanded by the medical college as ‘security’ against cash payment,” said an ACB official.They said that it is possible that the cheques might be for admission in various educational fields and also for other purposes such as allowing to appear for final year exam.
 
 “We have been receiving many calls since Wednesday morning informing us about the medical college and illegal activities. Further probe will take place on those points after verification. Search for other properties belonging to the accused will also take place during the remand period,” said the official.TNN
