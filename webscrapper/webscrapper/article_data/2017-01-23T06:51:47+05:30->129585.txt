KORAPUT:   had gone to her parents' house at   from Vizianagaram with her children, for Pongal. For her return journey, Joshada, a widow in her early forties, with a 16 year-old-daughter and 18 year-old-son, had boarded the  , which is attached to the Jagdalpur-Bhubaneswar Express, at Bhawanipatna on Saturday.

 The train reached   at 9.30 pm and the three were in the general compartment. "We had our dinner in the train. We chatted and my children were excited to reach home at the earliest. However, fortune had something different in store for me," said a visibly-shaken Joshada, in a choked voice.
 
 As the train left Rayagada station around 10.45 pm, all three went to sleep, with an alarm set on their phone to wake up near Vizianagaram.
 
 "Around 20 minutes after the train had left Rayagada and after getting hardly any sleep, I heard a loud sound and woke up. I thought that someone was pelting the train with stones but soon realised that the train has been derailed. There were screams all around and I came out of the bogie and waited for my children but they never came," Joshada said, in a broken voice.
 
 The two children of the woman who had lost her husband exactly a year back on January 22, 2016, to a disease in Vizianagaram, never came out of the bogie alive. They had been crushed inside and instantly killed. As the bodies of her children were brought to the district headquarters hospital of  , Joshada was inconsolable.
