Thiruvananthapuram: Though different areas that form the core of the city enjoy a better  , the spot where it finally arrives and undergoes treatment remains neglected. 

 Fed up with the continuing neglect, residents of   led by Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) conducted a dharna, which was inaugurated by Shashi Tharoor MP on Wednesday. 
 
 Though the Beemapally ward hosts the   plant at Muttathara, it lacks proper sewerage network. Not just Beemapally, areas such as Beemapally East, Valiyathura, Poonthura and Manikyavilakom etc lack sewerage connectivity. “It is the sheer neglect on the part of authorities. While the   from the city is brought to our place, we are being denied sewerage connectivity. Though IUML led the dharna, entire local community is behind us,’ said Beemapally Rashid, a counsillor. 
 
 Tharoor along with the protestors met STP officials for a discussion on the issue. KWA officials, in charge of STP, said that they would submit a report within two weeks about sewerage project in local wards. “We will prepare report to introduce sewerage connectivity for local communities,” said a KWA official.
 
 Sources said that the project to lay sewerage network in the coastal region was abandoned midway after KWA had to terminate the contractor over inordinate delay in the work. Thus contract work estimated at Rs 50 crore was terminated around two years ago. 
 
 Rasheed said that if the KWA or city corporation goes slow on executing the project, they would intensity the agitation and disrupt functioning of the STP. “The entire city will be affected if the STP stops functioning. They must understand that Muttathara is not the place to dump their waste,” he warned.
 
 “Followed up the dharna with a substantive meeting with the engineers of the   to discuss the way forward. Decent working waste management systems are a basic human right in urban areas. We cannot neglect them any longer,” Tharoor tweeted after the protest.
