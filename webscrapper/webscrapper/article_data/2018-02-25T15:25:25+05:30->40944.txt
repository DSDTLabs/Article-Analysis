Actress   has admitted that despite her   status, she can't justify the price of designer items unless they are at discounted prices.

  
  
 According to a report, the 42-year-old actress is worth an estimated $125 million but can't justify the hefty price tag of high-end garments, so waits until they are reduced in price so she can 'justify' the purchases.
 
 She said: "I know what's happening in fashion and have a stylist to get me dressed for red carpets, but I tend not to be a purchaser of high-end stuff because I just can't bring myself to pay the prices. I do love (online shopping outlet) The Outnet though - sometimes you can find designer pieces for, like, 80 per cent off and you think, 'OK, now I can justify this.' "
 
 Barrymore insisted she has never had any cosmetic surgery and credits a good skincare routine as her secret to looking and feeling good.
