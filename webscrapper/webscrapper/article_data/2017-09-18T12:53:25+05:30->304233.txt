The international sensation,   turned heads at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards. This was the second time she presented awards at Emmys. Last year, she presented an award where she was seen sizzling in a one-shoulder gown. She looked breathtaking in the crimson shade gown by Jason Wu. 

 
 
 This time too, the actress didn't disappoint us with her look. She took the stage with 'Black-ish' star Anthony Andersson to present the award for 'Outstanding Variety Talk Series' to John Oliver for his show. She joined the likes of Hollywood stars like Resse Witherspoon, Adam Scott and Viola Davis at the awards ceremony.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 She was spotted wearing a custom-made gown by Balmain. The white gown featured embellishments in a pattern, which somewhat looked like Indian motifs. She looked like a goddess in the white gown with a feathered train. The gown also had chunky crystal embellishment around the neck and armholes.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Going minimalist with this gown, she accessorised her look with only a pair of earrings. And when it came to her make-up, she didn't go for a soft look. This time, she went for dramatic make-up in vampy colours. Going experimental with her eye make-up, she boasted purplish smokey eyes. The colours were a mix of red and plum. Working this tricky eyeshadow, she completed the look with matching lip colour. Her hair was tied up in a sleek ponytail which worked perfectly with this dramatic look.
