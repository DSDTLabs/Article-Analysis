THANE: A 40-year-old   who was arrested in 2016 for   a four-year-old girl living near his home has been acquitted by a special   Act court for lack of evidence. 

 Special court judge  , in his order, observed that the prosecution miserably failed to prove charges under section 376 of the IPC and also section 8& 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against the accused. 
 
 The Nizampura police station in   had booked the man for alleged sexual assault and harassment of a four-year-old girl from the same locality. The prosecutor told the court that on November 22, 2016, the girl’s mother saw him sexually abuse her daughter when she was playing in front of her house. The woman told the police that as she raised an alarm and the neighbours rushed in, he fled from the spot. He was arrested soon after.
 
 The accused’s counsel, SH Pandre, denied his involvement in the case. 
 
 Only three witnesses, including the girl’s mother and the investigation officer, testified in the court. The third witness cited by the police turned hostile in court. 
 
 The judge said the girl’s mother also did not say anything incriminating against the accused in the court. In his judgment, the judge observed, “The evidence of the investigation officer is formal in nature. It is to be noted that when the informant and the alleged eyewitness have not supported the case, then prosecution cannot prove the charge on the basis of evidence of the police officer. The evidence on record is not sufficient to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt.”
