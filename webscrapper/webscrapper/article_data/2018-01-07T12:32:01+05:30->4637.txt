VADODARA: The   and school managements on the fees that private schools can charge after the   upheld the   Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017 continued in the city on Saturday as well. 

 Teams formed by district education officer (DEO) held meetings at three different private schools in the city. But the meeting at Baroda High School, Alkapuri witnessed ruckus as the DEO team had to face wrath of agitated parents who questioned their intentions of holding such meetings.
 
 The agitated parents not only termed such meetings as attempts to pressurise parents to give in to the demands made by school managements but also called it a futile exercise. 
 
 A majority of parents have clearly informed the DEO team that they do not need any intermediator’s role as they are ready to pay annual fees of Rs 15,000, Rs 25,000 and Rs 27,000 which have been fixed as upper limit for primary, middle and high school level by the Act. 
 
 “When the Gujarat High Court itself has upheld the Act where is the question of DEO or its team making any interpretation,” questioned an agitated parent. 
 
 The   on the other hand has decided to stage a silent protest on Sunday in the city to build pressure on the state government and the school managements. 
 
 According to the association, the silent protest programme will be staged at Dairy Den circle at Sayajigunj at 8 am to question the silence that the state government has adopt after the Gujarat High Court’s ruling which has come in favour of the parents. 
 
 The programme has also been called to protest against the alleged mental harassment and torture being done by school managements.
