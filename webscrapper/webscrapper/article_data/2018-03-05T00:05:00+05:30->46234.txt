Following his stint as a director,   is now on the path to becoming a full-fledged hero. Titled  , the   will see Rishab playing a detective by the name Diwakar. “The movie is set in the 80s, and is reminiscent of the detective stories of those days, be it the way it’s shot, the costumes, the feel and premise,” says Rishab. His character, meanwhile, is one which hasn’t been seen on celluloid in recent times, feels Rishab, whose acting pursuits include Tughlaq, Lucia, Ulidavaru Kandante and Ricky among others. “But to play a hero has always been on my mind and this film fulfils my aspirations to the T. My character is one who enjoys reading detective novels and watching annavru’s whodunnit films, which fosters his desire to become a detective. The rest of the film will surely pique the curiosity of the audience. 

  Such genres are not explored much these days, making Bell Bottom unique in that aspect,” concurs Rishab. 
 
  And in keeping with the film’s theme, he will be seen in a retro hairdo, bell bottom trousers, long collared, floral trousers, trench coats, hat and   glasses. Directed by Jaya Thirta, the film stars   as his leading lady.
