HYDERABAD: Stating that there would be no third or fourth front,   president NUttam Kumar Reddy charged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao of coming up with the third front drama to divert the attention of peoplefrom thefailuresof theTRS government.

 “With what face is KCR talking about a third front against Modi-led   after having supported the party for the president and vice-president elections, demonetisation and GST? Why is KCR not fighting for central funds and institutes that are due to   from the Centre? The TRS and the BJP have a tacit understanding and both are speaking againsteachother as a drama todivert the attention of public,”   said.
 
 Addressing public meetings as part of the   bus yatra in Bodhan and Nizamabad, Uttam urgedthe people to realise that KCR has been an undeclared ally of BJP for the last four years. “KCR is calling PM   a friend and rival in the same breath. His talk of third front is a game plan to cheat Muslims by not delivering his 12% reservations promise,” he said.
 
 “Only the Congress is capable of defeating BJP. Neither KCR nor MIM or any third front can defeat Modi. If you want to stop the saffron party’s march, vote for Congress and strengthen the hands of Rahul Gandhi,” Uttam said, evoking a huge applause.
 
 Opposition leader in the legislative council, Mohd Ali Shabbir said that except doing “bhajana” of her father, Kavitha has notdone anything significant as a MP. “What happened to12% reservations toMuslims promised by KCR?” he asked.
