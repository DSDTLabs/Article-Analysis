PANAJI: The first ripe   fetches a handsome price of Rs 300 per piece, but the pesky fruit fly   dorsalis cuts the farmers profits all the way - from its peanut size on trees to its ripened stage to the market.

 “The fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis is the most destructive insect pest in mango in India. The yield loss ranges from 5 to 30%,” says   R, scientist, (agricultural entomology) from Indian council of agricultural research ( ), Old Goa.
 
 The use of chemicals to control mango fruit fly is harmful to consumers, as it leaves toxic residue on fruits. Using methyl eugenol lure, which is artificially made and mimics the smell of the sex pheromone of the female files, is the best option to attract male flies in traps. 
 
 ICAR scientists recently trained mango growers at   on design and development of low-cost pheromone traps through a project funded by NABARD. A total of 40 traps were distributed to 24 farmers. They can easily make an eco-friendly trap with a plastic bottle and insert cardboard pieces soaked in the lure and poison for 24 hours and hang them on mango trees.
 
 The profitable mango crop is vulnerable to the pest throughout the fruiting and ripening stage and beyond. After the female lays the eggs in the small raw fruit, the maggots emerge from the eggs and feed on fruit pulp and inner content. 
 
 “These maggots destroy the pulp, making it foul smelling and discoloured. Infested fruits develop brown rotten patches on them and fall to the ground ultimately,” he said.
