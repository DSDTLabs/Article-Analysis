BENGALURU:   veteran C K   took his party by surprise on Saturday when he backed RSS chief   for the President's post, which falls vacant in July when Pranab Mukherjee's term ends. Congress distanced itself from Sharief 's statement. Recently, BJP ally   had also backed Bhagwat for the top post.

 In a letter to PM Narendra Modi, copies of which were released to the media on Saturday, Sharief said nobody should have objections to Bhagwat's candidature.“There are different schools of thought in India and it is but natural for such a vast country. Bhagwat may belong to one school of thought but there should be no doubt about his patriotism, love for the people of India and loyalty to the nation,“ he said in the letter.
 
 “As a Muslim and a person belonging to the minority community of India, I feel that minorities should not have any fear or crisis of confidence in Bhagwat's name being considered,“ Sharief (84) wrote.
 
 The former railway minister said that during  's regime, RSS had supported her in her decisions after the Bangladesh war of 1971 in the interest of the nation.
 
 “Why should anyone now become small and narrowminded to say we have no faith and confidence in an Indian, who is a patriot and who is wedded to democracy and also working for the welfare of the people?“ he said.
 
 Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah distanced himself from the statement saying: “It could be Sharief 's opinion.“
