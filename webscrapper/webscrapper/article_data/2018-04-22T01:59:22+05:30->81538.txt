NEW DELHI: The income tax department is keeping a close watch on candidates in poll-bound   who are resorting to new methods of inducements, such as supply freebies online, distributing coupons and fixed deposits with later maturity dates.

 
 Stepping up the heat against cash hoarders, the tax department has already seized cash worth Rs 4.13 crore and gold jewellery of 4.5 kg valued at Rs 1.32 crore in Karnataka, sources said.
 
 “While there are reports of cash shortage in some parts of the country, cash seems to be flowing in poll-bound Karnataka,” said a source.
 
 They said out of the total Rs 4.13 crore seized, Rs. 4.03 crore was in Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 denominations.
 
 “When the people are finding it difficult to withdraw the money from banks/ATMs, seizure of these high denominations is raising eyebrows. Bangalore tops the list with Rs 2.47 crore, followed by   (Rs 55 lakh),” the source said.
 
 I-T authorities are keeping a close watch in airports and railway stations. A person carrying Rs 16.5 lakh was intercepted at an airport.Follow up action was taken in Mumbai and cash worth Rs 37 lakh was seized. 
 
 In another case, household articles worth Rs 9.51 crore intended for distribution was found in a warehouse near Mysore.
 
 The I-T department has set up a 24x7 control room in Bengaluru to receive election-related complaints from the public and other agencies. It has also formed strike teams with statutory powers to act upon any information they receive.
 
 The department is gathering intelligence at public transport terminals and its air intelligence units are closely watching airports in Karnataka and neighbouring Goa. It also gathered details of contract payments made in the last quarter of the previous financial year and is comparing it with previous years to identifying abnormal cases.
