THANE: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that BJP’s alliance with   in the elections to local bodies will hinge on the latter’s acceptance of the need to end corruption. 

 Addressing his first election rally at Ghatkopar last month, Fadnavis had raked up the issue of corruption in the Sena-controlled BMC.
 
 Fadnavis also cryptically remarked that   workers should be ready for putting up an aggressive fight irrespective of their opponent.
 
 He was addressing party workers at the Maharashtra executive committee meeting in Thane on Thursday. Ten municipal corporations in the state, including the BMC, will go to polls on February 21. Elections to 25 zilla parishads and 283 panchayat samitis will be held in two phases on February 16 and 21. Workers had put up hoardings indicating that the party should not ally with the Sena in the impending polls. BJP state chief Raosaheb Danve, education minister Vinod Tawde, senior leader Eknath Khadse were present at the conclave.
 
 “Though our differences with the Sena are an open secret, the decision to stitch an alliance with them will be taken by the top leadership,” Fadnavis said. 
 
 “The alliance is being worked out and we have started talks. Our focus is more on bringing about a positive change in the life of the common man,” he added. Fadnavis also announced that BJP was working on accepting donations via electronic payments. Senior BJP functionary Madhu Chavan should contest the polls alone instead of “taking the crutches of an ally”. The conclave was attended by several key leaders from the state, including Independent MLA Vinayak Patil from Ahmedpur.   corporator Pragati Araj along with former MNS Thane chief Nilesh Chavan and Jaynath Purnekar from the   joined the BJP.
 
 Fadnavis said that only those who were associated with the public would get a party ticket. Danve took a dig at the Congress, by saying that those opposed to ‘notebandi’ would be met with ‘votebandi’
