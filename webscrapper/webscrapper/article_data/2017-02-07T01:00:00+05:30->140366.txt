Stand-up comedian   has visited Gurgaon a number of times for his performances, but he has never got a chance to explore the city. “Initially I used to do shows only in Bengaluru and later I started performing in Gurgaon and Delhi. I think crowd in Gurgaon is more cosmopolitan, you have more IT guys there, and Delhi has more energetic crowd. The audience that I attract is very similar to what I am, so people for my shows are the same everywhere, be it Bengaluru, Delhi, Gurgaon or Mumbai. Even after performing so many shows in Gurgaon, unfortunately, I have never got a chance to explore Delhi or Gurgaon. I come here for a day, perform and leave. So I have not been able to do Gurgaon darshan yet, which I would love to do soon,” said Kenny, who performed at   on Sunday.
