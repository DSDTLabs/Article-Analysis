Ambala: A surprise check by the district administration has revealed “many drawbacks” and “lack of security measures” at schools in Ambala, a member of the local juvenile justice board, Amit Jain, has revealed to The Times of India.

 The shortcoming were found at four governmental schools in the district carried out by a joint team of Ambala administration, including the district child protection officer, and those from child welfare committee and juvenile justice board.
 
 Members of the joint teams reached out to classes in governmental schools and asked students about ground reports. The team also saw the teachers’ attendance register. “The classrooms of the schools were in bad condition, with patches of cement falling on the ground. The classrooms had not been cleaned and the glasses of shelves and cupboards were broken, which could injure any student,” Jain said.
 
 The joint team directed principals to remove the shortcomings before the team’s next visit. Child welfare committee member Mohit Agarwal said the helpline number 1098 was written nowhere on the schools’ premises. “We have directed schools to ensure that the helpline is known by every student,” Agarwal said.
 
 It was informed that CCTV cameras were installed but there was no security guard at the entrance of the school.
