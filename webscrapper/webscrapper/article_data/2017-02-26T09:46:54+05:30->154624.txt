NAGPUR: The city BJP leaders quietly celebrated their victory in their party office on Saturday morning. It was expected that the party would take out a victory parade after winning 108 out of 151 seats in   (NMC). BJP national president   had announced that victory in local elections in Maharashtra and   would be celebrated in all district offices of the party across the country. 

 City BJP president   told TOI that it was not the party’s tradition to take out victory parades. “We distributed sweets among party workers to celebrate our spectacular victory,” he said.
 
 This is the first time that BJP has won a clear majority in NMC. It had first come to power in 1997 winning 63 seats in a house of 129. At that time Congress high command had frozen the party symbol and its candidates had contested as independents. This time there was no such condition and BJP won the battle fair and square.
