JAIPUR: Tribal leader Kirori Lal   on Sunday apologized for hurting   in the last 10 years as a BJP rebel. 

 Addressing chief minister Vasundhara Raje and BJP state president Ashok Parnami, Meena expressed his regret for a series of events post his exit from BJP in 2008. "During my exile period I may have uttered remarks during protest, demonstrated inside and outside the Rajasthan assembly. I regret those," said Meena amid slogans from his supporters who had gathered from Dausa, Sawai Madhopur and Jaipur. He, along with his wife and MLA Geetha Verma, was granted BJP primary membership after they dialled the BJP toll free membership number. 
 
 Supporters of Meena outnumbered BJP activists who burst fire crackers and beat drums outside party office. During the welcome address, Meena's first priority, self-assigned by him was to reach out to disgruntled workers across the state. Referring to the lost of BJP in the bypolls, he said, "I would like to move from a village to another bringing the angry party workers into the fold. They our our strength. I will leave no stone unturned to make inactive workers into active mode." 
 
 Taking a dig at  's reaction on the victory in bypolls, Meena said that they (BJP) have to look into the mistakes. "Congress shouldn't be happy over the victory. In electoral politics victory and defeat is part of a same coin," said Meena who praised Raje for not shown vengeance ever for him. While taking on his main opposition Congress, Meena attacked Gehlot for having keep him away from Udaipur during his campaign against hunger deaths. 
 
 He atleast thrice reiterated that he had left BJP but not the ideology. Establishing his ideology with the saffron party, Meena asserted that he has joined RSS Shakas as a volunteer to handle Shakhas and attained senior positions in RSS only due to my commitment for the ideology.
