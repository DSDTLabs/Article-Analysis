NAVI MUMBAI: Civic officials found providing half-baked response or failing to resolve   raised on the   e-grievance site have begun facing the heat. 

 With almost 53% of the 1,500-odd feedbacks from citizens giving negative marking to the resolution of their grievances, the civic officials have been asked to buckle up. 
 
 The matter came up for discussion during a monthly review conducted by the civic chief with the head of departments on March 4. The e-grievance system was started on September 20, 2016. 
 
 “The portal is a one-point medium for residents to not only raise their grievances with the authorities but also be assured of an appropriate response,” an official said.
 
 Citizens have the option of rating the resolutions between the scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poor, 2 average and 5 excellent. 
 
 Based on an average assessment of the feedbacks, it appears that a considerable number of complainants were not satisfied with the resolutions provided and were ranked either 1 or 2,” an official said.
 
  The department heads have been asked to formulate measures so that the negative markings are brought down to 10%. 
 
 Officials like ward officers and executive engineers have been asked to substantiate their resolutions with evidences like photographs and should even contact the complainants personally if needed. 
 
 Additional municipal commissioner   downplayed the findings and said the scenario has been changing since last week. 
 
 “The grievance addressal has improved considerably because officials are now providing real-time information of the resolution. They will provide the date when the actions were taken and also attach the photographs,” Chavan added.
