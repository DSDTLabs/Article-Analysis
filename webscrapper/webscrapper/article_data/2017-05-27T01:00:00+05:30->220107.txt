This season who wouldnâ€™t want to sport their best hair updo? Ditch the usual ponytail and choose from these varied braid styles that will make you look glamorous. 

 
 A crown braid looks great on those with a round face. To begin with, start by dividing your hair into two sections and braid the first section all the way down to the end. Repeat the same with the 
 second section of hair. Now bring the braid over your head, covering your ear and secure it with bobby pins.
 
 
 
 Whether you are wearing something casual, ethnic or formal, a fishtail braid looks great with almost all outfits. It looks elaborate and is a favourite with most women with long hair. Divide your hair into two large sections, parting it from middle. Pull a thin strand of hair from the outside of the left section and pull it over it and grasp it under the right side. Repeat this with the right side as well. Keep alternating the sides, weaving over and under until you reach the bottom. Tie it off in the end with a hair bobble.
  
 
 
 This is one of the simplest styles to sport and looks almost great on every face shape. If you are having a bad hair day, this is a style you can try out.
 To do this, start braiding your hair from the crown until the end. Then wrap it around and secure it using bobby pins.
  
 
 
 If you are wearing something traditional, this is a look you can try out. Tie your hair up in a bun and keep a strand or two of hair from your crown hanging loose. Next, plait this strand of hair and wrap it over the bun and secure it with pins.
