AHMEDABAD: A special   court in the city on Monday refused to grant bail to ex-joint director of Enforcement Directorate, Ahmedabad – JP Singh and two others in connection with bribery case in the multi-crore IPL cricket betting scam.

 Besides Singh, ED’s assistant director and investigating officer in the scam,  , and an informer, Bimal Agarwal, had also sought bail. Rejecting their bail pleas, the court observed that the ongoing investigation is at a crucial stage and their release could adversely affect it.
 
 The court said that during investigation, it has been revealed that the accused persons demanded bribe from bookies and punters and collected money from different punters, whose names have already came up in the ED investigation and a huge amount of bribe had been demanded by the accused.
 
 The court observed that there is evidence regarding entries in bank account so far as Singh’s case is concerned, and witnesses have stated about entries of bribe amount in case of Agarwal who was Singh’s main conduit and was in constant touch with him. Their conversation revealed that there is prima facie evidence of conspiracy.
 
 During arguments, Singh submitted that he had been falsely implicated in this case to scuttle probes in high-profile cases.
