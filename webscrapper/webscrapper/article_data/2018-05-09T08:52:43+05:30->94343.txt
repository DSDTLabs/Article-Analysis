BHUBANESWAR: Home secretary  , director-general of police Rajendra Prasad Sharma and IG (crime branch) Arun Bothra on Tuesday appeared before the National Commission for Scheduled Castes in New Delhi in connection with the alleged gang   of a 14-year-old girl in the Kunduli area of Koraput district in October last year. 

 The Commission summoned the officials to appear before it in person and present the details of the case. The girl had alleged that she was raped by four persons in uniform in October 2017.
 
  Around three months after the alleged rape, the girl committed suicide on January 22, making the ruling BJD face severe criticism.
 
 Commission member Yogendra Paswan had earlier visited the girl's family to get their version of what had transpired. "The Commission summoned the officials after Paswan's visit to the village," said a government officer.
 
 The summon holds significance as the clothes of the victim, sent by the state government to the   (CFSL), were found to contain no trace of semen. The CFSL report was submitted in court. 
 
 The clothes were sent to the CFSL for a re-examination as an initial report of the   had indicated semen marks.
 
 After ordering a Crime Branch inquiry into the case, the government had sought a court-monitored special investigation team (SIT) probe and a judicial inquiry.
