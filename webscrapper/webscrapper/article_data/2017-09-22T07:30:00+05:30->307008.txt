Chandigarh: The Chandigarh District court acquitted a person of   charges. The court of additional District and Sessions Judge Poonam R Joshi acquitted him under section 376 (punishment of rape) of the IPC. Earlier in the same case, the court had discharged the elder brother of the accused of rape and criminal conspiracy charges. It came to light that the wife of the elder brother of the accused hatched a conspiracy against her husband and her younger brother and framed them under rape charges to take revenge from her husband as he sought divorce from her. The prosecution could not prove the case while the woman gave a statement that her younger sister had filed a rape case against both the brothers after her husband wanted to divorce her.

 The matter dates back to April 2015 when Jainual and his elder brother Mohammad Masrool Khan were booked by police on the complaint filed by the latter’s sister-in-law. Both are residents of Manimajra .The court earlier had discharged Mohammad Mashrool Khan after no incriminating evidence was found against him. And on Thursday the court acquitted the younger brother as well.
 
 Mohammad Masrool Khan, 33, a resident of Manimajra, was suspended without an official inquiry, after he was booked in the case on a complaint by his wife’s sister. In her written complaint to the police, the woman had accused Mohammad and his younger brother of rape and later forcibly terminating her pregnancy, following which the police booked the duo under Section 376 (rape) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on April 8, 2015.
