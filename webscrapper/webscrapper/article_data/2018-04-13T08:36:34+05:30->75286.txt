AHMEDABAD: A Ghodasar resident has filed a complaint with   police against a woman for throwing acid on her and her husband when they had approached residence of the accused to demand money. The incident had taken place on March 31. However, as the groups could not come to consensus, they decided to press charges. 

 According to a complaint by Lata Lohiya, 36, a resident of Bhagirath Society, Ghodasar, her husband Mukesh had got Vinay Vaid, a resident of Avalon, Motera, a loan of Rs 10 lakh when he needed money to purchase a house two years ago. Vaid had promised to return the amount soon. However, when he allegedly failed to do that,   was under duress. After a few attempts, Vaid had agreed to pay Rs 1 lakh on March 31.
 
 "When Lata and Mukesh went to Vaid's residence on March 31, his wife Manju allegedly threw acid on them after an altercation. Afterwards, the couple had agreed to pay the dues and hospitalization charges and thus, the complaint was not filed. However, when they failed to do so,   decided to approach police. Further probe is on," said an official.
