Mumbai: Pune-based Force Motors has formed a joint venture (JV) with Rolls Royce Power Systems and will manufacture large engines for the German company’s customers of rail and power applications globally.  The 51:49 JV, in which Force Motors will hold 51% stake, will be called Force MTU power systems and will be based out of Chakan in Pune.  Rolls Royce said it will move the manufacturing of the entire line of 1,600 series engines from Germany to Pune, a move that is expected to create 200 jobs in the country.  The jobs in the German unit — about 60 of them — will be repositioned to other profiles and there will be “no impact on existing jobs,” said Andreas Schell, president and CEO, Rolls Royce Power Systems.  He said India was on his radar for quite some time now and this investment with Force Motors is beginning of a new relationship.  Force motors also makes vehicle engines for Mercedes Benz India and its competitor BMW, for their cars that are sold in the country.  The two companies said they will jointly invest Rs 300 crore in the phase I of the JV, in proportion of their holding.  “This gives us an opportunity to venture into businesses where we did not have a presence," said Prasan Firodia, managing director, Force Motors Limited. He added that the engines will be mainly exported, with some generator sales also happening in India.  Force Motors has been battling flattish sales and revenue for its own brand vehicles. In the nine-month period ended December 2017, the company clocked total revenue of Rs 2,488 crore against Rs 2,536 crore, in the same period, a year ago.  The JV, Firodia said, is expected to create a Rs 1,000 crore revenue opportunity for the company over the next couple of years.
