MUMBAI: An autorickshaw driver tried to end his own life after making his three daughters drink water laced with bed bug poison on Wednesday over his inability to repay a petty loan. All four are safe and getting medical assistance in a Jogeshwari (East) hospital. 

  probing the case learned that   (42) took the extreme step as he was unable to clear a Rs 30,000 loan. The four were rushed to the hospital after Rathod’s wife, Jaya (40), alerted their neighbours in an SRA building at Hari Nagar, Jogeshwari (East).
 
 Rathod had added poison in the steel water container around Wednesday noon. 
 
 When the three teenagers — aged 17, 15 and 13 — began to vomit, the middle daughter got suspicious and raised an alarm. At the time of the incident, Jaya, a domestic help, was on her way home from work. 
 
 “The exact reason will be known only after Rathod recovers. His wife said she only knew that he was depressed over not being able to repay the loan. She did not know why and when the loan was taken,” said Meghwadi police senior inspector P M Patil.
 
 In her statement, Jaya said, “He fought with me on Tuesday night for no reason. Our neighbours had to intervene to stop the fight. He had been tense over the past few days and it was the loan sum which haunted him. However, I don’t know why he had taken the loan and from whom.”
 
 Requesting anonymity, their neighbours said Rathod’s act has shocked them. “His elder daughter has missed her HSC examination. Luckily, timely alertness shown by one of the daughters helped save their lives,” said another neighbour. 
 
 The family stays on the ground floor of the SRA building.
 
 Rathod has been booked under the Indian Penal Code sections 307 (attempt to murder), 309 (attempt to commit suicide) and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison). He will be arrested after he get discharged from hospital.
