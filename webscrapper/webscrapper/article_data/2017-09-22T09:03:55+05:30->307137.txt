AGARTALA: A day after a   was killed in an alleged attack by Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) supporters near here, the state government on Thursday blocked internet and SMS services for 24 hrs to defuse communal tension triggered by the incident.

 Prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPc were promulgated in seven locations of Khowai and West Tripura districts where there is communal tension between the Bengalis and tribals. Chief minister   has appealed for calm in the state. He held a cabinet meeting that reportedly did not take up the issue of the journalist killing. This caused considerable resentment among the media persons in the state. Shantanu Bhowmik (27), who used to work for the proLeft Deen Raat TV, was returning home after covering a clash between IPFT and CPM workers at Mandwai in West Tripura district when he was brutally attacked. His camera person, however, managed to escape and reported the incident to police at Jirania.
 
 Police said four persons had been arrested in connection with Bhowmik’s killing. Of the four, two of them were sent to 14-day police custody on Thursday. They have been identified as   (18) and   (22), both residents of Mandwai near where Bhowmik was attacked. The other two will be produced in court on Friday.
 
 SP ( ) Avijit Saptarshi said, “Seventeen police personnel were injured while trying to control a mob on Wednesday. Two vehicles were damaged by the IPFT activists at the Mandai and Khumulwung areas of the district and police fought pitched battles with them in at least five places.” He added that the situation is tense but under control.
