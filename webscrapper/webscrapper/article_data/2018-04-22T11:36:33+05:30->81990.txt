PANAJI:  , despite hosting environmentalist  , musician   and others at the VC’s official residence till December 2017 and having spent close to Rs 22 lakh from 2008 to 2015 on its renovation, constituted a committee headed by K Dwarakanath Row to look into renovation of the VC’s bungalow.

 The committee, constituted on October 31, 2016, immediately “suggested that renovation of vice-chancellor’s bungalow may be taken up on priority and further that a suitable residence shall be provided to the vice chancellor until the completion of the renovation of bungalow”.
 
  
  
 “For necessary renovation and modification, the engineering and technical division of the university has now projected an estimate of Rs 58 lakh,” the committee told the council.
 
 Sahni and his family had moved into the official residence on August 19, 2016, and stayed till June 1, 2017.
 
 But on March 15, 2017, the Dwarakanath Row committee recommended not only to construct a new bungalow for the vice-chancellor “at a convenient location” but also refurbish the existing bungalow for Rs 41 lakh that was accepted by the university’s executive council.
 
 It also decided to provide Sahni with a temporary accommodation at a 4 BHK furnished villa with a garden at Aldeia de Goa for Rs 80,000 per month. On April 13, 2017, the committee revised the rent to Rs 85,000 per month.
 
 But eventually, Sahni settled for the sea-facing furnished apartment at   at  .
 
 In opting for the apartment, GU initially asked the owner to provide a rent reasonability report that certifies the rent of the apartment being justified. But when the owner declined to bear the cost, the university employed the services of its former staffer M S Chauhan, a project engineer, to provide them with the reasonability report. The fee for the reasonability report was also borne by the university.
