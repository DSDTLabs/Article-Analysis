GHAZIABAD: As the city struggles with the growing stray  , society residents, AoA members, animal lovers and representatives from People for Animals, held a meeting to discuss the issue on Sunday.

 The meeting was held at   under the aegis of Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association ( ). 
 
 Animal lovers present in the meeting said that it was a fruitful initiative as it would help to break the ice and help residents to better understand the situation. They also said that at times, the animals also become an issue of local and in-society politics.
 
 Sumedha Iyer, president of PFA said that these animals need care and love. Chasing them, denying them food and shelter further stresses them out, which turns them violent and aggressive in nature.
 
 In order to handle violent dogs, they can be taken away for a fortnight and kept under supervision, the PFA members explained. 
 
 In order to bridge the gap, FedAoA patron Alok Kumar said workshops will be organised in coordination with the PFA. “The workshops will be organised so that the parents and children know how to deal with stray dogs and understand them,” Kumar added.
