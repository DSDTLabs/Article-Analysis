Panaji: Demanding that the government scrap the Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority (GPPDA) and the outline development plan (ODP) for Calangute and Candolim, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) on Wednesday said that the ODPs and new PDA were just a new means to “payback” the builders’ lobby. 
 
 Saying that the new PDAs and ODPs were similar to the contentious Regional Plan 2011, which was rejected by Goa,AAP’s Goa convener Elvis Gomes said, “It is intended to meet those old commitments and also make quick schemes for enrichment by our ministers.” 
  
 He urged the people to protest against PDAs and ensure that planning is given to the people through the panchayats and municipalities on the basis of ‘swaraj.’ 
  
 “The ODPs have no scientific or constitutional basis New roads have been proposed through fields and mangroves as well as forests, with the intent of opening out new areas for development at the behest of local MLAs,” AAP’s Dean D’Cruz said.
