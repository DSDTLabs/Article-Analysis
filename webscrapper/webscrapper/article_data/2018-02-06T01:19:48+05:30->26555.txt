MUMBAI: City   president Sanjay Nirupam on Monday asked the NDA government to take immediate steps for the reduction of   and   prices. “If petroleum products are brought within the purview of the   regime, then petrol will be available for Rs 57 per litre, while diesel will be for Rs 54,” Nirupam said.

 Nirupam said that while the landing price of petrol was Rs 57 per litre and of diesel Rs 54 litre, owing to a series of taxes, including VAT, the selling price for petrol was Rs 81 and for diesel Rs 68. “Petrol and diesel are highest in Mumbai. To protest against spiralling prices..., Congress activists will stage a   on February 12 across the city,” he said. tnn
