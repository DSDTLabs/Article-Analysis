  : Untimely rain coupled with distress sale have claimed another farmer's life in the state. The farmer of   village, eight km from here under Bainchha panchayat, allegedly committed suicide. Sudam Khatua, 42, consumed pesticide on Tuesday. He died at the SCB medical college and hospital, Cuttack, on Wednesday . 

 A complaint lodged with the Balasore Sadar tehsildar by the family members said Sudam had taken a loan of over Rs 1.5 lakh from different persons and SHGs for farming. But recent rain and lack of storage facility led to distress sale of vegetables he had grown and he was under severe mental stress, his father Surendra Khatua said.
 
 After receiving the complaint, tehsildar Rashmi Rekha Pradhan rushed to the village to inquire into the matter. District collector accompanied by sub-collector and SP and horticulture and agriculture deputy directors visited Sudam's house on Thursday for a joint inquiry. The team also visited his farmland.
 
 "We have immediately given Rs 10,000 from the   fund and Rs 2,000 from government's Harishchandra Yojana for his cremation. The cause of the death will be known after the inquiry," said collector Pramod Kumar Das.
