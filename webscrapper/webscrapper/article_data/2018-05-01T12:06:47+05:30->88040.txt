PUNE: The   ( ) will distribute two garbage bins each to 10,000 households under its limits free of cost to promote segregation of wet and dry waste.

 Amol  , KCB’s chief executive officer, said, “Last year, we had distributed an equal number of bins at   (AFK) quarters and some civilian areas. This year, we will give out the bins at the army quarters and other civilian areas.”
 
 The objective is to inculcate a habit of garbage segregation at the source for effective disposal. While dry waste (inorganic) can be sent for recycling, the wet waste (organic waste) can be used for manufacturing compost and manure.
 
 Jagtap said, “A tender process for procurement of garbage bins is underway and special budgetary allocation has been made for the same. In the next few weeks, we will complete distribution of the bins.”
 
 The board has hired private agencies for door-to-door collection of garbage. Often these agencies complain of receiving mixed waste as many people do not give importance to segregation. However, the agencies have received a positive response from areas where garbage bins have been provided.
 
 A section of KCB officials said the board should distribute bins to all residents as the project does not require a high budget. “Since the board has got positive response so far for their initiative, it can invest more so that garbage collection would be much easier,” they said. Some of the board members pointed out that a section of the civil population was not using the bins effectively.
 
 A board member, who did not wish to be named, said, “Health department officials need to visit residential areas and take a stock of the situation on a regular basis. The department can conduct awareness programmes apprising the people of the importance of garbage segregation. Such initiative would make a positive change, particularly in slum areas.”
