Pop star   is being investigated by the   Sheriff's department for allegedly head-butting a man at a restaurant. 

 The department said that police responded to a 'battery report call' around 2 am and were told by a witness "that he saw Bieber get into two separate altercations with two bartenders". The witness further claimed that he "broke up the fights and asked Mr Bieber to leave" but the singer refused. 
 
  
  
 Bieber, 22, apparently left the restaurant before police arrived, and the victim who did not have any 'visible marks' from the altercation refused medical attention and did not want to file a police report, said police. 
 
 However, detectives are continuing to investigate the incident "to gather information and evidence in case the victim is desirous at a later date," the Sheriff's Station said. 
 
 Caroline McBride, a spokeswoman for the  , also said that they knew "very little" about the incident. "We can assure you that nobody from our staff was involved, nor did we call the police. We always have a pleasant experience with Mr Bieber whenever he comes to Serafina," she said.
