MUMBAI: The   that supply water to Mumbai received 66% of their total capacity till Sunday morning, with   near the brim a day after   started  .

 Tansa, whose full supply level is 128.6 metres, was less than a metre away from its overflow mark on Sunday as rainfall continues in catchment areas. Modak Sagar, which supplies 1.28 lakh million litres of water to Mumbai daily, started to overflow on Saturday. 
 
  said the lakes have 9.48 lakh million litres (665) as against their total capacity of 14.47 lakh million litres. Last year, it was 48% during the same period, while in 2015, the lakes had only 19.6% on July 16 as there was poor rainfall that year. As a result, BMC implemented a 20% water cut across the city for close to a year. 
 
 The civic authority checks water level in the lakes every morning.
 
 Officials caution that the city draws 3,750 million litres daily, so the lakes should have 14.47 lakh million litres of water till September end, after which the BMC decides its strategy for the entire year. If the lakes have full stock till September-end, the city will receive uninterrupted water supply till next June.
 
 Five of these lakes—Modak Sagar, Tansa, Upper Vaitarna, Middle Vaitarna and Bhatsa—are in Nashik and the neighbouring districts. The two smallest lakes—Tulsi and Vihar—situated in Mumbai have less water stock compared to the last year indicating that the city has received less rainfall this year compared to the catchment areas. Tulsi and Vihar have storage capacity of 8,046 million litres and 27,698 million litres respectively. They received 4,433 million litres and 12,336 million litres water stock till Sunday morning. They had 7,739 million litres and 13,589 million litres respectively during similar period last year.
 
 Around 58 tree-falling incidents were reported on Saturday and eight on Sunday, but no one was injured.
