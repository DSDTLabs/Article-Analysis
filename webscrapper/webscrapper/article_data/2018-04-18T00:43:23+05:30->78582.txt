Udhagamandalam: A 6-year-old male leopard was found dead inside a private tea estate at Ketticombai near Gundada village in the Kattabettu range of forests on Tuesday. 

 The carcass was found by estate workers, who informed the forest department. Government veterinarian Revathi conducted a postmortem.
 
  “No external injuries were found. Preliminary report of the postmortem did not suggest any cause for the death. Samples were collected for further tests. Only after the lab report we could come to a conclusion,” said assistant conservator of forests Saravanakumar.
 
  “We searched for clues in an area of about 1km radius around the spot but in vain,” he said. The carcass was burnt inside the forest area in the presence of forest officials.
 
 Meanwhile, residents of Gundada said they spotted the animal in their village earlier as well. “We demand patrolling by forest officials as the leopard was found dead in our village,” they said. Kattabettu and Kotagiri forest ranges are known for sloth bear movements too.
