BHATINDA: A team of the vigilance bureau on Wednesday arrested four officials of Gidderbaha municipal council, including a sub-divisional officer (SDO) and two junior engineers (JEs), for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 60,000 for clearing the payment of a building contractor.

 SDO Prahlad Kumar, JEs Navdeep and Gaurav Dheer, and clerk   have been accused of demanding the Rs 60,000 as “commission” for clearing a payment of Rs 9 lakh towards construction company Green Earth Builders. Ranjit Singh, a partner in the firm, had filed the complaint against the officials.
 
 Superintendent of police (vigilance)   said they had recovered Rs. 50,000 from Kumar and Rs 10,000 from Dheer. He said though the JE was posted to Jaitu four days ago, he had not relinquished the charge at Gidderbaha to accept the money. A case under the Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered against the four.
