NEW DELHI: Gangster Neeraj   has emerged as the mastermind of the  . Cops are also probing if he had offered any help to the criminals who gunned down Monu Dariyapur a few days ago.

 Bawana is currently lodged in the high-security  . 
 
 Cops said it was surprising that though most of Delhi’s gangsters were behind bars, their names were cropping up in the investigations into several crimes. The double murder reported from Seelampur in northeast Delhi last week is another case in point as police said it was committed on a jailed gangster’s instructions.
 
 According to sources, these gangsters manage to pass on messages to their aides through some jail staff in exchange of money or through authorised visitors who come to meet them in the prison. Another major channel of communication appears during their production in courts when they get ample time to talk to their associates. 
 
 In fact, the jail offers the gangsters a sense security with chances of rivals attacking them there less, sources said. Besides, they can freely concentrate on managing their syndicate while in jail.
 
 Bawana has been very active despite in prison. Arrested in 2015 by the Special Cell, he has been able to execute killings of his rivals without any difficulty. 
 
 On his target are his rival Neetu Dabodia’s men. Last January, he had ordered the killing of a Dabodia aide inside a jail van by staging a brawl. He also ordered the Rohini court killing. After Dabodia, who was killed in an encounter with the cell in 2013, Bawana became the top gangster in the city.
