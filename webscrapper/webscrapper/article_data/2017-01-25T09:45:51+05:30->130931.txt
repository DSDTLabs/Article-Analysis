PATNA: Sri  , a constituent unit of Magadh University, has been accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with B+ grade.

 A decision to this effect was taken at the 21st meeting of the NAAC standing council held in New Delhi on Monday. Five other colleges of the state were also accredited at the meeting.
 
 A three-member peer team of NAAC had visited Arvind Mahila College on December 23 and 24 to assess its academic and infrastructural developments. College principal Usha Singh hailed the verdict of NAAC and congratulated the teachers and non-teaching staff of the college for their hard work. “The college would make significant strides in academics in the days to come,” she said.
 
 Other colleges of the state which have been accredited along with Arvind Mahila College include Nagendra Jha Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Laheriasarai, Darbhanga (B++ grade), Janta Koshi College, Biraul, Darbhanga (B grade), Nalanda College, Biharsharif (B+ grade),  , Bhabhua, Kaimur (B grade) and Sachidanand College, Shahmal Khaira Deo, Rohtas (C grade).
 
 With this, most of the premier girls’ colleges in the state capital have been accredited by NAAC with satisfactory grade. While Patna Women’s College and Magadh Mahila College have been accredited with A grade, J D Women’s College and Arvind Mahila College have been accredited with B+ grade. Both the UGC and the state government have made NAAC accreditation mandatory for the colleges if they want to avail the development grants under Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha Abhiyan. A large number of colleges in the state are still to go for accreditation by NAAC, even though the government has been encouraging them and providing all help to do so.
