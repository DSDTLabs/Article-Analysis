Among the   awardees this year is veteran Kannada actress  . The actress, needless to say, is overjoyed that she has been bestowed this honour. 'I've personally never expected anything, now do I has any wants or wishes. But, I am very grateful that the government has chosen me as one of the award winners,' says Bharathi, who is currently busy with a few acting commitments. 
'This award is dedicated to every artiste and industry person, as what I am today is a sum total of all of their collective hard work. I feel honoured that someone like me, from   and South India, has been chosen for this award. The industry has helped me grow and reach where I am today, so this is also for all those who love me and respect me,' she adds.
 Bharathi, coincidentally, was one among the first actresses to go to Bollywood from Karnataka, acting alongside greats like Manoj Kumar and  . Ask her how she perceives the changes today and she says, 'It is nice to see how the industry has grown technically. Any industry has to grow and change. At times you like it, at times you question if this is what you need and there are times when it surprises and delights you. Everything changes over a period of time and often it is cyclical. You have the same subjects and the same costumes coming back in a circle. But, I feel glad to have been around to witness these changes over these decades.'
 Having been in the industry for over five decades now, we cannot but ask her what motivates her to don the greasepaint even today. 'Eventually it all boils down to good subjects and messages that the medium chooses to narrate. There is great power that films as a medium has, which can be utilized in the right way. Films like Yajamana, Bangarada Manushya and   are examples of how films have inspired so many lives and families. I always aspire to be a part of such films, till I can,' she signs off.
