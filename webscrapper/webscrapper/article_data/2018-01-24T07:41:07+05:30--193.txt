AMRITSAR: Karamjit Singh Rintu was elected as the eighth mayor of Amritsar on Tuesday even as local bodies minister   and 17 municipal councillors of the   boycotted the election proceedings. Raman Bakshi and Younas Kumar were elected as senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.

 Sidhu remained away from the election process to express his annoyance for not taking him in confidence in making selection of the mayoral candidates in Punjab, party sources claimed. Another cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, who was one of the two party observers appointed for Amritsar, was present on the occasion.
 
 “This will certainly impact the future since the lack of cooperation between mayor and minister of local government department can cause problems,”  , a Sidhu loyalist and councillor from ward number 26, told TOI after the mayor’s election.
 
 He claimed that as many as 23 of Sidhu’s loyalist councillors, including independents, had skipped the function to show solidarity with him. “Couple of them had gone to take the oath as councillor and returned to join us later. 17 boycotted the function totally,” he said.
 
 He said that they were all soldiers of the Congress but were upset over Sidhu being ignored. “Sidhu had asked all of us to attend the function but it was our own decision to boycott so that high command would notice the resentment,” he said.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, Sidhu couldn’t be contacted for comments. Sources said that he had left for Delhi on Tuesday morning. A couple of councillors, owing allegiance to Sidhu, had also gone to his house to meet him but returned disappointed.
 
 Prominent among those present were Amritsar MP   Aujla, MLAs O P Soni,   Verka and Sunil Dutti and district Congress president Jugal Kishore Sharma. One of the mayoral aspirants Raj Kanwalpreet Singh Lucky said all councillors of the Congress should stand by party high command’s decision to strengthen hands of the new mayor.
