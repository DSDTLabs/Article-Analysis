LUCKNOW: With the   setting the ball rolling for the seven-phase polls in the state, the electoral battle would be largely confined among the three facesâ€”Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati of the BSP .

 The two regional satraps, Akhilesh and Mayawati, both claimants of the hot seat of chief minister, are not contesting elections, at least as of now, and would be leading their armies from the front. Mayawati had not contested the 2007 and 2012 elections either and remained a member of the  .
 
 Of the two national parties, Congress has declared   as its CM candidate, but she is ready to withdraw in case of an alliance with the SP while the BJP has not announced any name as its CM candidate. The party is going to the polls in the name of Modi and any loss in the elections would raise a question mark over his popularity.
 
 Akhilesh has hinted that if at all he has to contest, he would fight from a place out of the family bastion of Saifai. Similarly, Mayawati too, has made it clear that she would not be remained confined to any one constituency and be working for the whole state. In fact, it was Mayawati who started this tradition of becoming chief minister without contesting the assembly elections. Before her, most CMs, including Kalyan Singh, Mulayam Singh and Rajnath Singh, had contested the elections.
