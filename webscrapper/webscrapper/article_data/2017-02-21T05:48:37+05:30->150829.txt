UDAIPUR:   Biological Park in Udaipur may soon see new additions in animal kitty. The new guests who will join the park soon are a  , a  , a pair of Himalayan bear and four pairs of Asian brown tortoise.

 “ Presently, we have 125 animals in the zoo and we will get a tiger and hybrid lioness from Pilikula Biological Park, Mangaluru , Karnataka under animal exchange program” Dr. T Mohanraj, deputy conservator forest (wildlife) said. The central zoo authority has sanctioned the proposal and in exchange, eight parakeets and a Dalmatian pelican would be sent to Mangaluru. The pair of Himalayan bear would be a gift from Aizwal’s zoo in Mizoram.
 
 Sajjangarh park already has two bears which are very popular amongst visitors especially children. However, the mother bear is blind and grown too old and therefore, an extra pair is being sought to raise the bear family, the officer said. Presently, there is a female tiger, Damini, who have been living a solitary life since the inception of the park. Similarly, there are two hybrid lions in the park and proposal is to send one of them to Mangaluru zoo in exchange for lioness. With the additions of animals expected within a month, families too may see an increase in coming months.
