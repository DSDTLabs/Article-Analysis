Sharwanand, who plays a cleanliness obsessed Anand in  , has an interesting theory about OCD. “I think OCD is not a major disease or anything... It’s just a condition that’s born out of fear more than anything else,” says the actor, adding, “Audiences will definitely relate to Anand because in real life, you do come across people with peculiarities of their own. Broadly speaking, we can call it chadastham in Telugu. In Mahanubhavudu, we took it just a step further. Anand wants things around him to be spic and span; but things go for a toss when this obsession gets out of hand.” 

 
 Calling the film a perfect family entertainer apt for a Dasara watch,   says, “It’s a clean romantic comedy. The love story will appeal to youth. Scenes between Mehreen (Pirzada) and me have come out extremely well. the drama, be it between Anand and his mother or between Meghna (Mehreen) and her father, will strike an instant chord with families. And, there’s plenty of rib-tickling comedy as well.” 
 
 
 
 
 Apparently, Mahanubhavudu, produced by   and Pramod under UV creations, releasing today, has no villains. “Anand’s OCD is the villain. How it becomes a stumbling block in his love story has been narrated in a hilarious manner on screen,” adds Sharwa, who is all praise for his director. “Earlier, we had Jandhayalagaru who used to give each of his characters some unique aspect.   has done something similar with Mahanubhavudu. I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that he is the best entertainer we have in the current generation. I’ve had the opportunity to do varied roles in my career to date and undoubtedly, comic roles are the toughest. Comedy is an art and if I’ve managed to do well in this film, it’s because of Maruti.”
