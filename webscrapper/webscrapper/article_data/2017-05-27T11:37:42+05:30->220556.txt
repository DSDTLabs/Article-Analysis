PANAJI: Despite the government’s efforts to streamline traffic movement at the St Cruz-Merces junction on NH 17 by installing traffic signals, citizens are yet to get accustomed to the disciplined manner of driving.

 The signals have been installed to cover different angles at the junction - for people commuting to  , Bambolim, and  . Yet, negligent drivers continue to violate traffic rules while others are left to their own judgement.
 
 “The signals have been superficially installed. There is one each, facing Panaji, Bambolim and Merces, but nothing to direct people coming from St Cruz, who are left clueless at the junction. People approaching the highway from   have to strain themselves to check the   which faces Panaji, as their only source of direction. This defeats the purpose of the installation,” restauranteur Pascoal D’Souza said. 
 
 While the new installation may have imposed traffic discipline among the commuters, self-discipline is far from being achieved. Some riders were seen restlessly crossing over despite the signal clearly indicating red.
 
 Locals attributed this to the lack of proper monitoring by traffic police. “Ever since the signals have been imposed, police constables don’t visit the junction as often. A dedicated constable should be constantly placed here to keep check on violators,” said Valley Pereira, a seafarer from Merces.
 
 DySP (traffic)   said, “I will personally check and see what can be done at the St   junction”.
