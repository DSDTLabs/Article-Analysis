Vadodara: Raopura police booked a man from Chhota Udepur and his parents for kidnapping and criminal conspiracy after his wife went missing with their twin children since March 2016.

 The woman Shakuntala’s father Kalyansinh Rathwa gave his complaint against Vikram Rathwa and his parents Hemsinh Rathwa and Shanta Rathwa at Chhota Udepur police station. But the complaint was transferred to Raopura police station since Kalyansinh had last seen his daughter at SSG Hospital in March 2016.
 
 Police said that Shakuntala and Vikram got married around four years back, but when the couple had a rift she decided to go back to her parents’ house. When her parents also did not accept her, she called 181 Abhayam helpline. She was brought to the city and stayed at Nari Sanrakshan Gruh. Meanwhile, she delivered twins children at SSG Hospital on March 29, 2016.
 
 When Shakuntala’s parents, Vikram and her in-laws learnt about it, they came to city. At the SSG Hospital, Vikram decided to accept his wife and children. Cops said that Vikram and his parents gave an undertaking on a stamp paper to Kalyansinh and Nari Sanrakshan Gruh. Kalyansinh in his complaint told the police that after Vikram and his parents took Shakuntala and the two children to Chhota Udepur, there has been no communication from her and she has gone missing.
 
 When Kalyansinh asked Vikram and his parents about them, they too did not give any proper reply to him, Kalyansinh alleged.
 
 A police official said that they are yet to take any statement of anyone connected with the case. “Once we go to Chhota Udepur and probe, we will learn whether the woman and her children have really been kidnapped,” the official said.
