MUMBAI: After having only a day to revise for exams, the class XII physics paper for   students here was a tough nut to crack for many. "The paper was lengthy and questions were tricky. The combination turned out to be ugly. The paper was lengthy due to multiple diagrams and lengthy explanations," said a student from R N Podar School, Santacruz. The school has sent the students' feedback to CBSE. 

 Students had been wary about the physics   as they had only a day's break before the paper. "The subject has two books to be covered and 16 chapters. A day is too little to revise the syllabus," said  , principal,  , Panvel. But some principals said it was not difficult. tnn
