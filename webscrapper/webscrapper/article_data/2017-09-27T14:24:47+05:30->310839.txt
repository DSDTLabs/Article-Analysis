CHENNAI: Frowning upon   being compelled to attend former chief minister  's centenary celebrations being organised by the Tamil Nadu government, the Madras high on Wednesday barred mobilisation of schoolchildren for such meetings. 

 A division bench of Justices S Vaidiyanathan and R Subramanian passed the interim order on a plea moved by A Narayanan of Change India seeking a ban on mobilising schoolchildren for public meetings. 
 
 Narayanan also wanted the court to direct the government to prepare draft guidelines to be followed by school education department, police and school management whenever children are made to participate in public functions, rallies and campaigns held at venues outside  . 
 
 To prove his case that students are compelled to attend such meetings, Narayanan relied on a news report published in TOI on August 30. The news report said on government's instruction, students of many government and private schools in Kancheepuram district were forced to attend MGR centenary celebration held at VGP grounds in Vandalur. 
 
 "As per the news report, many parents and teachers expressed their displeasure in the misuse of schoolchildren by school education department," he said. 
 
 He further claimed that representations given by his organisation to the government was only met with indifference and belligerence by the authorities. Pointing out that a grand public meeting is being planned to be held in   on September 30, the petitioner said there was every likelihood that thousands of innocent school children would be put to lot of avoidable inconvenience and harm by bringing them to the venue, merely to satisfy the ego and whims and fancies of the rulers.
