CHANDIGARH: With the implementation of centralized admission system for the eleven colleges of the city, six private colleges have demanded from the   department to change the norms set for the general quota and UT pool in order to   to various courses. As per the proposal of the private colleges put up to the UT higher education department, they should be allowed to convert the vacant seats under UT pool into the general pool after the second counselling of the course.

 The issue about the conversion was raised last week by the private colleges in a meeting which saw the participation of all colleges. The meeting was chaired by state liaison officer UT higher education  , in which the private colleges raised the issue that as they were for the first time becoming part of centralized admission, they should be allowed to fill up the vacant seats.
 
 Rana said the department has agreed to the de mand raised by the private colleges. The   has already been following this conversion policy in BCom centralized admissions and the same is expected to be followed for the other courses too. He said the instructions regarding the proposal will be issued to the colleges so that the vacant seats can be filled by the colleges after the second counselling.
 
 Dean, admission of DAV, B K Vermani college Sector 10 said four courses would be covered under centralized admission system and the number of applications which the colleges have received for various courses under UT pool has been less in compression to the number of seats. Considering that seats go vacant even after second counselling, private colleges should be allowed to convert them into general category (outside UT), said Vermani.
