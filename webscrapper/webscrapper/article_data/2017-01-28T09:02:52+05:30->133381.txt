VASCO:   did what no other Goan team had managed to do in four years. 

 Since inception in 2013,   have travelled to Goa in the knowledge that they can turn up at any venue ­  ,   and   ­ against any opposition and walk away with full points. They probably believed the same at the Tilak Maidan on Friday , until they were brought to earth by the unlikeliest of teams. 
 
 Bengaluru FC captain   scored his first goal in more than three months to give his team a 22nd minute lead.
 
 The visitors were in control and looked good enough to return to winning ways after the loss against East Bengal but Churchill turned the tables on their opponents with goals from   (33rd minute) and   (53rd minute) for a thoroughly deserving 2-1victory. 
 
 The defeat will be hard to digest for Bengaluru FC. They also have to live with the disappointment of missing their star defender John Johnson for a minimum of two matches after he was sent off in the 84th minute.
