Gurgaon: A plea in the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking to vacate the ex-parte stay granted to Paras Buildtech on fresh demarcation of a natural drain in   by MCG could not be heard on Thursday, as the matter was not listed. 

 After the petitioners complained of wrongdoing on the part of officials in the court registry, the Haryana registrar general Gurvinder Singh Gill directed his staff to find out why the matter was not listed, terming it “suspicious”.
 
 “Application of vacation of ex-parte stay has the highest priority in courts. As per the high court rules, it is mandatory that the urgent petition filed by us on May 2 has to be listed for hearing on May 4,” said petitioners Sharmila Kaushik and Vaishali Rana. 
 
  However, this was not done and it seems to be the work of people who did not want the case to be heard on Thursday,” added petitioners Sharmila Kaushik and Vaishali Rana. The matter will now be heard on Friday.
 
 The petitioners, who are residents of Valley View Estate in Gwalpahari, where the private builder is allegedly constructing a building right on the Kost nullah, have sought the stay to be vacated on two grounds. 
 
 “The private builder has sought the stay on the ground that they will incur irreparable loss if the MCG demolishes its project, even though MCG has only issued a notice to conduct a fresh demarcation and has nowhere used the word demolition and that Paras has not revealed to the high court that the same matter is being heard by the technically competent National Green Tribunal in Delhi.”
 
 Paras Buildtech, though, claimed that it has informed the high court about the case being heard by the National Green Tribunal.
