TRICHY: The rural police are inching closer to ascertain the identity of the 25-year-old woman who was found murdered under mysterious circumstances in an isolated area in Maamalaikadu near   on Tuesday morning. 

 As the woman’s face was partially crushed with a stone and couldn’t be identified, the Thuvarankurichi police collected particulars of missing women cases registered in and around   and Pudukkottai districts. 
 
 Sources said the woman’s identity was almost ascertained by the police on Wednesday as a woman from a village near Thuvarankurichi had filed a complaint about her missing daughter two weeks ago. 
 
 Police said the woman, on seeing the identification of the body, confirmed that it was her daughter’s body. Police are waiting for thorough information as there was also a doubt whether the victim was subjected to any sexual assault.
