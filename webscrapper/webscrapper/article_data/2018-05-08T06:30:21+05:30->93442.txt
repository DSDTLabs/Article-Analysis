LUCKNOW: The mystery of the murder of a designer found dead in the room of a city hotel on Sunday deepened further when the man whom police was considering to be the prime suspect was also found dead in a hotel in   on Monday.

 
 Abhinav Pal (28), the prime suspect in the murder of designer Arpit Dixit, was found dead with a bullet injury under his chin. Police recovered a countrymade pistol from the hotel room but did not find any suicide note. Earlier in the day, police said that Arpit had, in fact, been murdered after the post-mortem report confirmed that he had been killed.
 
 ASP (west)   said that injuries from a sharp-edged object were found on neck, arms and eyes along with contusions all over Dixit’s body. Since police were suspecting that Abhinav had murdered Dixit and escaped, a police team was sent to Bahraich where Pal was teaching at a polytechnic and another to his house in Kanpur to trace him. While police were still looking for Pal, manager of Hotel Harsh in   police station area of Bahraich, Manish reported the suspicious death of a youth who had checked into room number 27 on Sunday morning.
 
 CO ( ) Amit Rai said that the body was identified as that of Pal. “He had a gunshot injury under the chin and a countrymade pistol and liquor bottles were recovered from the room. No suicide note was found. Pal had probably shot himself,” police said. “Pal’s death came to light when calls from hotel staff to the room went unanswered. The staff told us that Pal had arrived alone,” said Rai.
 
 Cops took the mobile phones of both Pal and Dixit in their custody for further probe.
 
 On Sunday, the highly decomposed body of Arpit was found from the room of a hotel at   crossing. Arpit had checked into the hotel booked online by Abhinav.
 
 The CCTV footage of the hotel showed Pal leaving on May 5.
