CHARMINAR: In its first meeting, the   board decided to repatriate its chief executive officer, Mohammed Asadullah, to its parent department. The sudden move, less than a fortnight after the Muslim endowment panel was constituted, has raised eyebrows. 

 Sources said that the certain members of the new board were unhappy with some of Asadullah's decisions. "The former chief executive officer took certain steps after the approval of then competent authority Syed Omer Jaleel. This has not gone down well with them," said a source who did not wish to be identified.
 
 Soon after Asaduallah's repatriation, the board appointed Ziauddin Ghori as interim chief executive officer even as it delegated certain powers to its chairman Mohammed Saleem, who is a member of the legislative council from the   (TRS).
 
 Speaking to TOI, Saleem said, "The hundi of the Annaram Shareef dargah was auctioned. Furthermore, the term of the in-charge mutawalli of Dargah Hazrat Yusufain was extended by three years. Appointment of staff was also done. Such things can only be done by an elected board." 
 
 For his part, Asadullah said that all decisions were taken after requisite approvals from the then competent authority (CA) Syed Omer Jaleel, who is also secretary,  . "Extensions have been given by previous boards. Cases in point: the Mallepally Masjid and   in  . Without the CA's approval, the CEO cannot take a decision independently. I have been asking for repatriation and leave myself."
 
 Meanwhile, the board resolved to auction hundis. According to Saleem, the auctioning was on hold for over a year.
