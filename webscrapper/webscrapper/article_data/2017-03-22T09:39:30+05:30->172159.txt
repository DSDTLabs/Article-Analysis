HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad HC on Tuesday directed the Telangana government,   and endowments commissioner to file affidavits explaining the facts and circumstances of alleged   by some private parties on government land at Devatalagutta at Balapur.

 The bench comprising acting Chief Justice   and Justice Shameem Akhter was dealing with a PIL by Devatalagutta Parirakshana Samithi vice president N Ramreddy challenging the alleged inaction of the authorities in preventing the private parties from making construction activity in government land. Petitioner's counsel PSP Suresh Kumar told the court that  , a real estate firm, was constructing villas by demolishing temples and other structures in 150 acres of government land and also land belonging to private individuals. “All our complaints have fallen on the deaf years of the authorities,“ he alleged. HMDA counsel   too supported the contention of the   and was of the view that there was a need for action against the errant private player. A status quo order from the HC earlier was misinterpreted by the builder, he said. The bench did not relish the idea of a state organ pleading helplessness and wanted it to be assertive.
 
 The bench sought replies from the authorities within one week and posted the case to next week.
