NEW DELHI: The   ( )-Nicolai Adam saga is over. The U-17 World Cup is just nine months away. In the federation's words, 'it's time to move on as the time is short.'

 "There were some interpersonal relationships which went sour between the young players and the coach. The player and the coach must have a comfort level otherwise none of the parties will be able to deliver. We tried to see reason. We felt that it is not going to work. Time also is short. We couldn't let a situation like this to continue. Now we will have a new coach in this place by the end of this month," AIFF president   told TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the official mascot of the U-17 World Cup 'Kheleo' at the JLN Stadium on Friday.
 
 When asked why an investigation or inquiry did not take place in Nicolai's case, Patel said, "Let us not go too much into the technicalities. The fact is there was friction between the players and the coach. We could not have let the situation to continue. We took immediate action. If we receive a complain, then what are we supposed to do?"
 
 Nicolai was sacked by the AIFF following complaints of physical abuse by the players. "It's not that we wished this to happen. We want to have the best coach in place. I have spoken to   (chairman of the technical committee) and   (head of scouting) that they will have to be more involved in the coming months to integrate the team with the new coach. The U-17 campaign will be on track as early as possible with the best possible coach," said Patel.
