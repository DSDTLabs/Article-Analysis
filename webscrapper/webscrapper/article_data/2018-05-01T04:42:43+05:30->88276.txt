MUMBAI: Six months after an activist complained to the railway minister of two male passengers being allowed to use a ladies' washroom at   railway station, the GRP recently registered an FIR against the contractor. No arrests have been made yet. 

 The public washroom was inaugurated on platform No. 3 of   by BJP MLA Ashish Shelar on October 26, 2017. "Passengers started queueing up at the washroom. Around 3pm, the queue of male passengers was particularly long. The contractor permitted two male passengers to use the ladies' washroom," said RTI activist Shakil Ahmed Shaikh, who was present on the platform. "I questioned the contractor on how men could be allowed to use the ladies' washroom. I also shot a video on my cellphone, which shows a woman passenger waiting outside the washroom while a male passenger emerges from it. The contractor defended his action and claimed that there were too many male passengers in the queue. I asked him who was to be held responsible if a woman passenger stepped in and was harassed," Shaikh said. 
 
 Shaikh went to the Bandra GRP outpost and summoned a police constable. He also dashed off a complaint to railway minister Piyush Goyal. In a letter later sent to Shaikh, the Bandra GRP said that they had booked two men, Roshankumar Gupta, 28, and Noor Islam Shaikh, 32, under the Maharashtra Police Act for obscenity and produced them before a railway court. The duo was released on bail. "Shaikh wanted to press charges against the contractor. He submitted a CD of the video recording he had made. We conducted a preliminary probe before lodging the FIR under the IPC's section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) on April 27," said a GRP official.
 
 The office of the Divisional Railway Manager ( ) also wrote to Shaikh, informing him that the Railway Protection Force had been asked to stay vigilant and take action if such incidents came to light in future.
