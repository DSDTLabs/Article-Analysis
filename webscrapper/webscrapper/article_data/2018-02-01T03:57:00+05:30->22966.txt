Nagpur: Yet another public interest litigation (PIL) was filed on Wednesday before the bench of Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Justice Swapna Joshi against orders issued by the state chief wildlife warden to shoot problem tigress of Pandharkawda. Petitioner Dr Jerryl Avinash Banait filed the PIL through his lawyer Tushar Mandlekar. The PIL seeks to quash shoot orders issued on January 29. The petitioner has submitted that forest department has illegally attributed 10 human kills to the problem tigress T1 without any “cogent and conclusive evidence”. The orders were issued in a hurry without even calling police panchnama, the petitioner said. Dr Banait has stated that PCCF has himself held that presence of a male tiger T2 is found in the same area and it has also killed human beings, which dilutes all the charges on problem tigress T1. Hence, the tigress cannot be declared a man-eater without any concrete evidence. Its elimination will further hamper the next three cycles of reproduction and will defeat conservation goals, says the petition. Dr Banait alleged that the PCCF discussed only two deaths out of the total 10 incidents of human deaths — one of Satish Kowe (Sakhi) and Ramaji Shendre (Loni) in the shoot order to declare the problem tigress as dangerous to human beings. Even these two deaths are not scientifically proved and attributed to the tigress, he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Mumbai-based social activist Dr Sarita Subramaniam’s e-mails submitted through her counsel Ravindra Khapre before the high court were treated as a PIL against the shoot orders. The matter has been kept for hearing on Friday.
