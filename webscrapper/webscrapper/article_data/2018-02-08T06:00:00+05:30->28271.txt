Kolkata: A proper business environment is key along with infrastructure support and connectivity for attracting more US investment in the eastern region, feels US ambassador to India Kenneth I Juster. He was answering a question during an interactive session with the members of Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCC&I) here on Wednesday. 

 The   pointed out that this part of the country is very important for US investors and this region is linked with south east Asia. “Connectivity and infrastructure is important for the investors and the environment should also suit US investment in the region,” he added. 
 
 There are close to 200 US Companies operating here. According to him, US companies are involved in engineering, automotives, life sciences, banking, insurance, consumer products and hospitality. “All of these are examples of the enormous potential of our mutually beneficial economic relationship — especially if we view it through a strategic lens,” the US envoy added. 
 
 On defence cooperation, Juster said both the countries take part in military exchanges. “And I was suggesting that in the future, there could be an exchange of commands. That’s still something in the future. The US is probably more than fine in doing that and I am not sure if India is too comfortable with that idea yet,” he said. 
 
 He added: “We seek to assist India’s efforts to build up its indigenous defence capabilities, as well as enhance the inter-operability of our two forces as major defence partners in the Indo-Pacific region.”
