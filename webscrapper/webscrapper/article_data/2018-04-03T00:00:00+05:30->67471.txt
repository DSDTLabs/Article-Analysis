Danseuse   says that there’s nothing more liberating than having an individual power to vote and make a difference. Here’s why she thinks it is important that every single Bengalurean votes:

 "The first time I voted, I wanted to be recognised as a person who has voted, and have that ink on my finger. I became an adult in Bengaluru. My family used to live near   and I remember the excitement I had to exercise my franchise and being a part of a thinking entity called India. It was a huge deal for me. 
 
 "I remember going to the voting booth and a man very shabbily blobbing the ink on my nail; I had a full black finger as opposed to the dot that I wanted. We couldn’t instantly share pictures back then, but I insisted that my father pull out his camera and take a picture after I got the ink on my finger. God knows how much later it was processed. 
 
 "My mother was 84 during the last elections and I remember, when we went to the  , her name was not there. She was adamant that I find out what was wrong, because she wanted to vote. That was when I realised how passionate the people who belonged to the nationalist era are. They had fought for their freedom and wanted to be a part of the system. 
 
 "Youngsters need to realise this, because they have got everything so easy; we’ve never had to live under any kind of suppression. We need to go out and vote. I have never been someone who complains. If things happen, then it is good for me, and if they don’t, I take it in my stride. We need to be out there and encourage people to vote and be a part of the electoral process. 
 
 "However cliché it sounds, if we want change, we have to be the change. We can start by exercising our right to vote. We live in an age of stereotypes — it is so easy to follow someone. But you have the right to think for yourself and choose who you want as a leader. To think and have a personal philosophy of what you want — a vote is the extension of that."
