AHMEDABAD: Noted Gujarati poet, novelist,   and critic, Chinu Modi, known by his pen name ‘Irshad’, passed away at the age of 78 on Sunday evening due to multiple   following a massive cardiac arrest. He breathed his last at his residence in Paldi area of the city.

 He is survived by two sons and a daughter who have decided to donate his body to N H L Medical College. 
 
 Modi was admitted to a city-based private hospital after he suffered acute breathlessness at his home on Thursday. His son revived him by cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but his condition remained critical for the last two days and he ultimately suffered multiple organ failure. Doctors at the hospital said that his family members decided to get him discharged and took him to their home.
 
 Prime Minister   and Gujarat chief minister   have expressed their condolence at Modi’s demise. “Passing away of Chinu Modi is a great loss to Gujarati literature. His work and literary flare will always be remembered,” said the PM. 
 
 His contemporary writer and Jnanpith awardee Raghuveer Chaudhari remembered Modi’s contribution in all the forms of literary creation. 
 
 “Though he was around seven years younger than me, I found him very friendly and passionate towards poetry and also all the forms of literary creation ever since I met him. He started writing poetries first and later wrote Ghazals, short stories and novels as well,” Chaudhari said.
 
 “He started hotel poetry club where he used to encourage young friends to read, write and to critique. His plays were gems and were performed for many years. Besides, his contribution in translation, especially in Hindi, and adapting stories of previous era and putting them into the current era was magnificent,” added Chaudhari. He said that the way he had treated his literary creations, Modi should have also treated his health well.
