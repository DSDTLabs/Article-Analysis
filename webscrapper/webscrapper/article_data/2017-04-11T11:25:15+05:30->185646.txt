PUNE: Police on Sunday booked a 12-year-old student of a private English medium school for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl of the same institution. 

 The incident took place in the girl’s hostel room on April 2, and came to light last Sunday. The girl’s mother immediately lodged a complaint at the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.
 
 “We have detained him and sent him to a correction home,” senior inspector Vijaysinh Gaikwad. 
 
 The boy has been booked under sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
 
 The girl is recovering from shock, and undergoing treatment at a hospital.
 
 The   happened around 2.30pm on April 2, when the girl returned to her room after playing in a water tank on the school’s premises of the school. “When she entered her room to change, the boy followed her in, armed with a wooden stick,” a police officer said. 
 
 After the sexual assault, the shocked girl fainted. The boy waited for her to regain consciousness, and thrashed her with the stick, terrifying her into keeping mum. However, school authorities noticed the injuries, and alerted her parents. The girl’s aunt took her home. The girl revealed everything to her aunt on Sunday, who in turn told her mother. 
 
 Gaikwad said the police are planning to take action against the school too. “It is the duty of the school to ensure safety of its students. When the sexual assault took place, no teacher or caretaker was nearby. They also should install   cameras on their premises,” he said.
