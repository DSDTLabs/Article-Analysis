After being part of superstar movies such as Loham and Puthan Panam, actress   is all set to essay the female lead in Dhyan Sreenivasan’s upcoming movie, directed by Thomas Sebastian of Mayabazar fame. 

 An excited Niranjana, who is currently shooting for the film, tells us, “I am thrilled to be the heroine of the movie, which is fun-filled and youth-centric. I play a character named Fidha, who is a cousin of Sreenath Bhasi’s character, Ajas. I will be romancing Dhyan in the movie.” The untitled project is based on a story by Anoop Joseph and Dhyan’s screenplay.
 
 On her role, she says, “Fidha is an unorthodox Muslim girl and so I get to wear a lot of beautiful clothes and colourful duppattas. The shooting set too is fun filled just like the movie’s content.”
 
 Besides Niranjana, Dhyan and Sreenath, the film has Aju Varghese, Hareesh Kanaran and Oru Mexican Aparatha fame Vishnu Noolu playing pivotal roles. Director Thomas Sebastian says, “Dhyan plays Varun, who wants to make some quick bucks with his friends, played by Aju and Sreenath. Aju has a quirky role in the movie as Prakashan." 
 
  Set in Kozhikode, the film would reflect the beauty and serenity of the place, says the director. “Similar to the sets of Ustad Hotel, we have built a coffee shop at the beach, which has an integral role in the movie,” Thomas signs off.
