NAGPUR: Hazra Fall, a picturesque spot in Salekasa forest range in   division, 190km from Nagpur, will be declared a   heritage site (BHS). Earlier, ‘Glory of Allapalli’ in   district has been notified as BHS.

 Under Section 37 of Biological Diversity Act, 2002 (BDA), the state government in consultation with local bodies may notify in the official gazette, areas of biodiversity importance as BHS.
 
 “BHS is closely linked to ecological security and therefore, human welfare. To strengthen the biodiversity conservation in traditionally managed areas and to stem the rapid loss of biodiversity in intensively managed areas, such areas need special attention,” says VK Sinha, PCCF & member-secretary of   ( ).
 
 The decision on Hazra Fall and four other sites is expected to be taken in the 12th Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB) meeting scheduled to be held in Mumbai on May 24. The meeting, which is being held after a gap of 18 months, has a long agenda. Its last meeting was held on November 9, 2015. 
 
 “For declaring biodiversity sites proposals need to be forwarded by local biodiversity management committees (BMCs). Hazra proposal is expected. We have received consent from BMCs in Pune, Jalgaon and Ratnagiri,” MSBB chairman Vilas Bardekar told TOI.
 
 Hazra Fall is an ecotourism site run by joint forest management committee (JFMC). It attracts thousands of tourists from the region. The place also has camping as well as trekking facilities. Sinha said the meeting would approve incentive to NGOs to assist formation of BMCs at gram panchayat level in the state. It would also discuss recruitment rules of the board.
 
 The meeting will discuss biodiversity documentation project and constitution of experts committees besides district level structure for supporting BMCs. There is also a plan to declare species symbol at district level. A draft list of threatened plant and animal species will also be discussed, sources said.
