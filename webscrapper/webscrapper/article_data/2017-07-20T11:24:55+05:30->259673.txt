PUNE: Slower sales and government policies have shrunk the size of new housing units in the city over the last two years.

 The average home size of newly launched projects in the city has dropped 16% over the past two years to 722sqft (built-up), a report published by real estate developer   stated. At the end of June 2015, average per unit size of newly launched projects stood at 837sqft, which dropped to 800sqft in the six-month period ended June 2016, it added. 
 
 As a part of the study, nearly 3,700 projects across the   (PMRDA) Region were surveyed over the last two years.
 
 It said overall prices are trending down because the new projects being small in size are being launched at lower prices. The current average price across the region at Rs 4,786/sqft is at the levels last seen in second half of 2013 (Rs 4,806/sqft), the report revealed.
 
 Rohit Gera, managing director, Gera Developments, said, â€œOur expectation is that new unit launches will drop further in the July-December period of 2017.
