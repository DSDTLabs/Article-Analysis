Trichy: The mushrooming   have choked the   Road, inconveniencing motorists. A few months ago, the civic body had removed encroachments and were supposed to widen the road but work is yet to start. Meanwhile, new encroachments have come up, eating into the road space. 

 The half kilometre stretch from Kohinoor theatre to railway over bridge on the Karur Bypass road has encroachments eating into 15ft of space on either side of the road. Last June, the civic body carried out an eviction drive and retrieved the 30ft of road space using earth movers.
 
 The stretch dotted with commercial establishments became a congested place as shoppers park their vehicles on the pavement build on the encroached space. There were a few small shops which had put up asbestos sheds projecting towards the road. Some road side vendors also occupied several areas. 
 
 The menace had been causing inconvenience to motorists including many  . Traffic is slow even during non-peak hours, due to the new encroachments that have come up. 
 
 "The eviction drive was considered a bold decision as the civic body didn't relent even though there are big hotels, commercial establishments and private hospitals on either side," said Trichy based RTI activist  . But this has been of no use as the new roads laid on either side have been encroached upon again, he added.
 
 "Though it is mandatory for every building to have parking space, many of them don't. And even though some buildings have parking space, motorists still choose to park on the road," said commuter  .
 
 However, officials claim that they are awaiting funds from the state government for widening the road. A senior official from the city corporation said that a proposal has been sent to the state government for funds to widen the stretch. The proposal estimated to cost Rs2.75 crore will facilitate an 80ft road with pedestrian pathways on either sides, central median and street lights.
