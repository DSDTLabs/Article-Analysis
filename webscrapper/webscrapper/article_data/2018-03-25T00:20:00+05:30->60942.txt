Kanyakumari: A female elephant trampled its 25-year-old mahout to death at Vellachiparai near Arumanai in Kanyakumari district, close to the Kerala border, late on Friday night. Sources said that evening the female jumbo Valli alias Ammukutti was brought from Thrissur in Kerala, for the festival at the Badrakaliamman temple in Vellachiparai only that evening. Valli was among the jumbos that were to take part in the grand procession to commemorate the festival at the Badrakaliamman temple on Saturday. According to police, preliminary inquiry with the temple authorities revealed that the pachyderm was tied to a pillar close to the temple on Friday night. The mahout Sameer, 25, allegedly beat the elephant with a metal rod many times which infuriated the animal. In a fit of rage Valli tossed Sameer with its trunk and stamped him with its foreleg. People who were closeby rescued him from the furious elephant and rushed him to a nearby primary health centre. As Sameer suffered multiple injuries including fractures he was referred to the Neyyattinkara government hospital in Thiruvananthapuram district but he died on the way. Based on a complaint lodged by the temple authorities, the Arumanai Police, attached to Kanyakumari district police, are investigating the incident. While an inquiry was conducted with the eyewitnesses, the victimâ€™s body was sent to the government hospital for postmortem. Veterinarians were attending the elephant that had calmed down a bit on Saturday. It is suspected that the jumbo would have been tired after a tedious truck journey and attacked the mahout in a fit of rage. The incident left devotees and public shocked as it took place on the eve of commencement of the temple festival.
