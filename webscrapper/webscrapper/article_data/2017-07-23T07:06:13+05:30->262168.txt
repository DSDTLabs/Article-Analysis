MYSURU: P olicemen at T Narsipur in Mysuru district on Saturday used coracles and firefighters to stop farmers from getting into the   river during their protest against release of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu. 

  There was some tension when a couple of agitators jumped into the water but were pulled out by firefighters. They were taken into custody. A senior police officer said the agitators were later released. The farmers wanted the government to release water to the irrigation canals from Kabini dam and entered the water at   at the temple town, 34kms from here. 
 
  Former DyCM R Ashok criticized the state government for releasing water to Tamil Nadu when farmers in the   in   need it. "This is not acceptable," he said. 
 
  Farmers protested at the   office at Nanjangud and raised slogans against district in-charge minister H C Mahadevappa. 
 
  Water release from Kabini dam has been stepped up as the reservoir is inching closer to its full capacity. About 1,000 cusecs were released from the dam on Friday and this was stepped to 6,000 cusecs. Authorities have stepped up outflow from   dam too. The outflow, which was 1,546 cusecs on Friday, was scaled up to 2,414 cusecs on Saturday. 
 
  Meanwhile, heavy rainfall in Kodagu district earlier this week is beginning to have an impact at the KRS reservoir, which is inching towards the 90-foot mark as water is flowing into the dam. 
 
  However, Mandya farmers, who are urging authorities to release water to irrigation canals, are sceptical about the government taking a favourable decision soon to provide water for sowing. "There is no reason to be delighted about heavy inflow as yet because the KRS reservoir has only 13 tmcft of water. The authorities will not release water to irrigation canals for agricultural activities," said Induvalu Basavaraju, a leader of the  . The government is likely to impound water for drinking water purpose, he said.
