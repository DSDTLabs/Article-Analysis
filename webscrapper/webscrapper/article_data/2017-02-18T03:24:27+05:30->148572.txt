MUMBAI: The high court on Friday set aside the ban on sale of liquor in Thane district on February 19 evening for the civic elections.

 Wine merchants and hotel associations had challenging the collector’s January 24 circular, which directed that all liquor vendors will not serve or sell liquor from 5pm on February 19, 20, 21 (the day of polling) and on February 23 (counting day).
 
 The petitioners’ advocate Ramesh Soni argued that under the Maharashtra Foreign Liquor Rules and the Maharashtra Country Liquor Rules at the highest a direction can be given to all vendors not to keep open a day before elections but not “48 hours before”. He said in respect of all other districts the authorities have followed the rules. He also urged that the ban on sale of liquor should be restricted till the declaration of votes. The government’s advocate said the circular has been issued under the rule governing the sale of liquor under the Representation of People’s Act and it also covers local elections. 
 
 A bench of Justice Vidyasagar Kanade and Justice P R Bora agreed with Soni that the rule is clearly applicable to the Lok Sabha and assembly elections and not in respect of local elections. The bench added: “We are of the view that it is not necessary to impose a ban after the results are declared since counting is done electronically these days and results declared by afternoon.” Justice Kanade in a lighter vein said: “The intent is to ensure that liquor is not sold during polling. Parties have been wiser enough to store liquor.”
