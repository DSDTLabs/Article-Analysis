Mumbai : The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Friday trapped a senior public works department official for accepting a bribe of Rs 20,000 from an engineer. 

 He is the second high-ranking official from the Nashik division to be trapped by the ACB in the last three months. 
 
 A 26-year-old electronics engineer had approached executive engineer Ramdas Kamble for registering his name under a scheme for unemployed engineers. Kamble demanded Rs 20,000 from him. The engineer then approached the Nashik ACB and a trap arranged was in Kamble’s office. He was allegedly caught red-handed accepting the cash along with a clerk A S Kedar.
 
 Another executive engineer Devendra Sakharam Pawar, along with his subordinates Sachin Patil and Ajay Deshpande were arrested recently while pocketing a bribe of Rs three lakh. They had demanded money for clearing bills of a contractor, who was awarded contracts by the public works department in the Nashik division. “Despite the best efforts of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, there is no end to corruption due to lack of supervision at all levels. It’s shocking that a jobless engineer had to pay Rs 20,000 just for registering his name under a government scheme. On one hand both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Fadnavis have embarked upon a series of schemes for job generation, on the other hand, high-ranking officials are demanding bribes for enrolment into schemes for the unemployed,” said a senior official. 
 
 Many have complained that it is tough to get arrears cleared. “In many cases, unless a bribe is paid bills are not cleared. Following Fadnavis’s intervention, a scheme has been drafted for immediate release of bills, but we are unaware of its success,” he said.
 
 “It is public works minister Chandrakant Patil’s responsibility to end corruption in his department,’’ the official added.
