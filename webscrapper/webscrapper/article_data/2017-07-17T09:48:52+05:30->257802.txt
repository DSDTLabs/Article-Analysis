NEW DELHI:   (25) and Komal (23) were having frequent tiffs of late as Kumar started suspecting his wife of having an affair. Last month, Komal went to live with her parents. 

 However, that was not the worst point of their marital life. That came when Kumar called her for one last meeting and strangled her in a park in north Delhi.
 
 Kumar is one of the dozen husbands who have killed their wives in rage in the capital over the past six months. If the incidents of wives surviving such an attack are also counted, the figures will shoot further. What is more worrying is the apparent reason behind these killings — most of them were committed on  . In some cases, husbands themselves have committed suicide after finding “evidence” of adultrous behaviour. 
 
 Escalating anger is a fallout of insecurities, said clinical psychologist Rajat Mittra. “The phenomenon is mostly found in men when they cannot accept an equal status for their partners. Most of the time, allegations of adultery are found to be false as they use it as a means to gain sympathy at court during prosecution,” said Mitra.
 
 Mental health experts also blamed popular culture like movies and televisions soaps for the increased intolerance among couples. People tend to believe anything they see on screen and try to emulate similar situations in their own lives. 
 
 Police officers said that in 2015 and 16, the trigger behind such cases was mostly financial crunch and fights over petty issues. For example, on March 29, 2016, a man murdered his wife in   as she did not serve him food timely and later asked him to help himself. Mitra said that in the fast paced life in a city, many men got suspicious if their wives stayed out till late, returned from work at odd hours or were on the phone for long periods.
