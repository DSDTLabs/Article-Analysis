BENGALURU: As HD   took oath as the 24th chief minister of the state on the steps of Vidhana Sabha, the proudest in the crowd were his father HD   and son   Kumaraswamy.

 
 While Deve Gowda renewed his old alliances and ensured that none of the VVIPs felt left out on the grand dais, Nikhil forged future alliances by sticking to the younger generation of leaders like SP president Akhilesh Yadav and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.
 
 The spring in the 85-year old former PM’s step was clearly discernible as he asked his assistants to step aside and walked briskly from one end of the stage to another, greeting all the dignitaries.
 
 Having taken all precautions and measures to make the national party leaders feel at home, Gowda took to the crowd and waved at them to loud cheers. He later sat beside his allies,   leader   and   in the centre of the dais.
 
 Nikhil sure made his presence felt on the grand political stage. Despite his politically active cousin, and HD Revanna’s son Prajwal, being the first to arrive along with his grandfather, Nikhil was seen projecting himself as the son of the CM.
 
 Prajwal and his father stuck to the sidelines. While   kept company with JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav and senior Congress leader Jaipal Reddy, Prajwal hung around behind the scenes.
 
 Kumaraswamy’s wife Anitha, in a green silk sari, also went around greeting all senior political leaders and even spoke a few words with BSP chief Mayawati and Sonia Gandhi.   also waved to the crowds along with others.
 
 The usually quiet member of the family, Deve Gowda’s wife Chennamma, too was present on the stage. She stuck to her husband’s side and appeared only for a photo-op when invited by Nikhil at the end of the ceremony.
