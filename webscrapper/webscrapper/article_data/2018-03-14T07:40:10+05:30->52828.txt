The SC had also ruled that bulls are not anatomically suited to racing and that practices that cause animals excruciating fear, pain, and suffering are inherently cruel.
 
 District collector Saurabh Rao said that he heard the members of the outfit and has communicated their demands to suitable authorities in the state government. “One of their demands is finalization of guidelines that will allow such competitions.

We have communicated these demands to the state government,” he said.
