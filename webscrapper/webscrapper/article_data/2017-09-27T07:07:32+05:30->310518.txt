PUNE: A ward boy of a private hospital was arrested on Monday for outraging the modesty of a 17-year-old college student undergoing treatment at the facility.

 A Wakad police team led by senior inspector   took the 30-year-old suspect into custody when he was about to flee to his native village in Karnataka. The arrested ward boy has been charged under Section 354 (outraging modesty) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the   (POCSO) Act.
 
 An officer of the Wakad police said the college student and her 20-year-old brother, also a student, stayed in the   area. The girl student was rushed to the hospital on Sunday after she complained of severe stomach pain. “The doctors admitted her in the hospital for treatment,” the officer said.
 
 Around 3.30pm, the ward boy entered the girl’s room on the pretext of examining her. “The college student claimed that the suspect had outraged her modesty by removing her clothes and left the room,” the officer said.
 
 The shocked student told her brother about the matter and also informed the hospital administration. “The girl’s brother on Monday came to the police station and lodged a complaint,” the officer said.
 
 When the suspect came to know that the student would lodge a complaint against him, he decided to leave the city. “We arrested him before he could flee to Karnataka,” the officer said.
