India is a free country, but, why are girls still fighting for equality? From equal pay to their clothes, women are often objected on what they 'deserve' and 'what they should wear'. 

 No matter how successful or powerful women get, when it comes to our society and their mentality, nothing seems to change.

 But, you’ll never hear a male actor getting criticised for going shirtless or see their zoomed inappropriate photographs. Believe it or not, women are always the first to get judged.

 -Girls don’t go out at night!
 -Are you actually wearing that? 
 -Your dress is too revealing, at least leave something for imagination! 
 
 Many times, Bollywood actors have come out and have taken a stand against such comments and body-shamers. And in the latest social media campaign, now even TV actors have come out to support women and their choice of clothes. From Anusha Dandekar to Jennifer Winget, many actors have now joined the social media campaign: #ShaveYourOpinion! They are now posting their photographs online holding a razor in their hand and creating awareness about women and their choice to wear what they want!
