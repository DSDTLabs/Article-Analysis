 The actor laughs off the recent controversy that was sparked off by his comment that he wants his wife to be a homemaker. “I don’t see anything wrong in saying that I am the breadwinner and my wife can stay at home and do what she wants to. She is a corporate professional and she is at liberty to choose what she likes to do after marriage. Being a homemaker is also a huge responsibility.” The couple plans to tie the knot in a few months.
