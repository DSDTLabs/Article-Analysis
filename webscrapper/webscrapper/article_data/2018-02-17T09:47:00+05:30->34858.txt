CHANDIGARH: A liquor vend just 40 feet away from the play way-cum-day care centre school on VIP Road,   has been has been operational for the last four years, but surprisingly the authorities are clueless. A visit to the area revealed this astonishing fact. The school has 40 students and toddlers stay at the centre between 9 am and 5.30 pm.

 Paramjit Singh, assistant commissioner   feigned ignorance when grilled on the existence of the vend. But he assured he would look into the matter and get it removed as it violates the norms of the government. As per the norms, the liquor vend should be 100 metres away from the boundary wall of the school, he added.
 
 Vasudha Jolly, principal of the GROOTS school said the vend has been running since the school was shifted here. She said that she was planning to shift the school now. The veteran principal expressed shock at the fact that a liquor shop is running near the school. Residents said they had raised the issue with the local authorities and public representatives but all in vain. 
 
 As per the norms no liquor or cigarette vendor is allowed within a distance of minimum 100 metres from the boundary wall of an academic institute of the area. No licence for sale of liquor will be granted to a liquor shop or premises selected within such a distance.
