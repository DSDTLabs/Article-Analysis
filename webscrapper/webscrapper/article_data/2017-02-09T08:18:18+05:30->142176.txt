JAIPUR: In a setback for food and civil supplies department,   on Wednesday stayed the decision of not renewing licenses of   distributors in the absence of land conversion certificate. 

 After facing danger of complete closure, five agency owners approached court. Giving them relief, Court issued notice to the government asking them to reply. Enthused with court’s order, two agencies that were shut down as their licenses were not renewed too are planning to approach court. 
 
 “There has been some respite as agencies will remain operational. Court has also asked the state government to respond,” said  , president of  . 
 
 However, the decision to go one day strike on February 15 has not been rolled back by the distributors. According to the office bearers of the federation, a meeting has been called on Monday and final call will be taken on it. 
 
 After the high court rap, food and civil supplies department asked all agencies to produce land conversion certificate to get their licenses renewed. The court in its orders has specified that commercial activities can be carried out only when the land is earmarked for that purpose.
 
 So far, the state government had provided relaxation to the agencies that have not converted their land for commercial usage. About 495 agencies in the state and 55 out of 70 operating in Jaipur were to be affected after the government notice. If licenses are not renewed, these agencies were not be able to supply LPG cylinders in their areas.
 
 The federation though has asked the government to classify LPG godowns and earmark places for LPG storage, the demand comes with a rider that it should not be far from the present location. The federation also claimed that the state has no jurisdiction over them as they receive clearance from   (PESO), department of the Union government.
