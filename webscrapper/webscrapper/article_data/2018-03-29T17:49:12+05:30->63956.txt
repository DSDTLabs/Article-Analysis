Former Indian cricket team captain   was in Lucknow recently on a business trip. Overwhelmed by the love and affection showered on him by Lucknowites, Dhoni shared memories about his previous visits to the city.
"Lucknow is not a new place for me. Main yahan aakar kaafi cricket khel chuka hoon. Kaafi acchhe tournaments hote thay yahan. Aur iske alawa jab bhi Kanpur match khelne jaate hain toh Lucknow se hokar hi guzarte hain," said the Indian team wicket keeper,” adding, "Hopefully, I will keep coming to Lucknow and will spend more time here, as now I have professional obligations here."
 When asked about the cricketing talent from the state, captain cool replied, "UP has a lot of cricketing talent. There has been some extraordinary talent coming from the state. When I used to play U-19, then also the team of UP was way too good. The fast bowlers here are experts in swinging the ball both ways. And everyone knows that the state has given several great batsmen to the sport."

 With Nepal coming into play now in international cricket, we asked Dhoni about the Nepalese cricket team gaining ODI status by defeating Papua New Guinea in the Cricket World Cup Qualifier, and he said, "It’s very good to see them qualifying. I was fortunate to meet the team once and they were working very hard so I told them to focus and enjoy the game to be on the top. To make cricket a global sport, I believe more and more such teams must come into the fray. And it is good that associate nations are trying to gain ICC’s ODI status."
 Dhoni, when quizzed about the workload cricketers’ face today in context to   recently talking about cricketer’s increasing workload, he candidly replied, "I have already retired from Test Cricket so the workload is not an issue with me anymore."
