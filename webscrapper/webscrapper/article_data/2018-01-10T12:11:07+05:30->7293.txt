PUNE: The education department has launched the online link for shutting down 1,300 schools in the state. Teachers and activists are against the state’s decision and the government has yet to reply to the  's notice about this closure. 

 Officials said the decision was taken based on an NGO’s survey, which activists did not believe. They said a random decision based on student enrolment statistics spurred the closure decision without considering if the students have a nearby school as per the Right to Education Act parameters.
 
 The link was made available on Tuesday and will be open for two more days. District administrations have to fill up the data about the schools that are closing down, a senior official from the primary education directorate said. Nearly 300 schools have been shut and the rest will be closed in two days.
 
 A senior primary education directorate official said, “The decision was taken by the state government. The order came from the ministry. As many as 287 schools were closed before the link opened. Now, the process of filling forms for the remaining schools is underway.”
 
 RTE act says the state can shut schools with less than 20 students. The government has decided to close down schools that have less than 10 students.
 
 “ The act also talks about the responsibility of the local governing body to establish a school within one km for students between standards I and V and 3km for students studying between standards VI and VIII. This criteria is hard to follow as sometimes there are just two students in the school within 1km,” a ZP official said.
 
 Nandkumar, secretary for school education in  , said no laws have been broken in opening the link. “We will be reply to NHRC within the stipulated four weeks. Once the data is in, we will make sure that no child suffers because there is no school nearby. We will not take any decision that violates RTE act,” he added.
