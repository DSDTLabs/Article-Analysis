English heavy metal band   star   Halford is set to be honoured with the Lemmy Lifetime Achievement Award. The 'Breakin' The Law' hitmaker was close to late Motorhead frontman Lemmy Kilmister, who passed away in December 2015 after suffering from inoperable prostate cancer, and is thrilled to have been chosen for the accolade.

  
  
 "At long last the metal stars are aligned and I'm stoked to attend this year's Loudwire Awards show," the 65-year-old rocker said. "I'm excited to shout hails with horns up for all of my friends at Loudwire and all the bands and the fans! It's going to be a hell of a crazy night of good times and major surprises!" 
 
 Judas Priest will be joined by Body Count, Halestorm, Starset and Power Trip at the ceremony held in downtown Los Angeles on October 24.
