BIJNOR: To counter SP-RLD’s intense door-to-door campaigning,   is using ‘Ragini’ folk songs to garner sympathy votes in   assembly bypoll.   is a local folk song form heard in the rural belt of western UP. It is a story sung with musical instruments, but with limited enactment.
 
  “Lokendra tu to chala gaya, ab kaun rokega ye aansu (Lokender you are gone, who will console us now),” says one of the many songs specially composed by BJP to make an emotional appeal to the residents of Noorpur. The party’s campaign vehicles with loudspeakers fitted on them take multiple rounds of the constituency every day, ensuring that these songs reach out to each and every resident.
  
  BJP MLA Lokendra Singh Chauhan had died in a car accident and his widow Avani Singh will be contesting on the party ticket from the seat this time around. Often, Avani with her two sons can be seen on a campaign vehicle with a poster of her husband, urging voters to support her.
  
  Simultaneously, scores of BJP leaders and workers are carrying out door-to-door campaigning. According to party insiders, several BJP bigwigs will be visiting the constituency in the next few days. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath will be here on Thursday.
  
  On the other hand, SP-RLD candidate Naemul Hasan has been silently conducting door-to-door campaigning. So far, none of the senior SP leaders have visited the constituency for canvassing. However, according to sources, SP president   may arrive here on May 26. SP district president Anil Yadav said, “Party workers and leaders are working round the clock to campaign for our candidate. Leaders from all sections of society are visiting households individually to garner support for Hasan. Our party president may be here on May 26. We are confident about our win.”
