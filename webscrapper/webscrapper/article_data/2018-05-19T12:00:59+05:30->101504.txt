SHIMLA: The inquiry report in   incident, in which assistant town planner Shail Bala and PWD employee Gulab Singh were killed by hotelier Vijay Singh Thakur, submitted to additional chief secretary (home) B K Agarwal has indicted police for security lapses. 

 On May 1, a team of officials had gone to Mando Matkanada area near Dharamapur in Solan district to remove unauthorized constructions by Narayani Guest House and some other hotels on the directions of Supreme Court. When the drive was launched, Narayani Guest House owner Vijay Singh Thakur of opened fire and killed assistant town planner Shail Bala on the spot. PWD employee Gulab Singh had sustained bullet injuries and died in PGI, Chandigarh, this Sunday. 
 
 According to sources, the 136-page report by Shimla divisional commissioner Dinesh Malhotra has highlighted lapses by the police in providing proper security to the staff during the demolition drive. They said the report has recorded statements of around 18 people, who have pointed out that had police officials exercised caution and gone to the spot with full preparation the shootout could have been averted.
 
 The report also noted that the accused fled from the spot and that of the two policemen chasing him only one was carrying weapon. It was not difficult for gun-wielding Thakur to threaten them and shake them off. 
 
 While presiding over a review meeting of the home department in Shimla three days back, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had said that Kasauli incident was a blot on the functioning of state police.

Sources said that report is yet to be submitted to the chief minister, who will take further action after going through the report.
