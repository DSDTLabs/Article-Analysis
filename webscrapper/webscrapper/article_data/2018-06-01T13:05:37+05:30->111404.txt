NEW DELHI: India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a robust pace of 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter (January - March) of the fiscal year 2017-18, government data showed on Thursday. The   during this period is the sharpest since the government outlawed old currency notes valued at Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 in November 2016.

 
  
  
 
 The   rate for the full fiscal year 2017-18 came at 6.7 per cent. But what does it mean for the common man?
 
 Data showed that the per capita income of the country rose from Rs 1,03,870 in 2016-17 to Rs 1,12,835 a year in 2017-18. Which translates into an annual   of 8.6 per cent for the average Indian. 
 
 The 7.7 per cent growth rate in Q4, in fact, managed to beat Street expectations and should bring some cheer for economy. The country's financial performance in the last quarter of FY18 meant that India retained the tag of the fastest growing major economy, with China growing at 6.8 per cent in their last financial quarter. In fact, the $337 billion that India added to its economy in 2017 is more than the GDP of 158 economies and also more than the combined GDP of 67 smaller economies.
 
 However, as skeptics would point out that while India's economy may be deemed to surpass China's , there's a catch.
 
 Despite growing at a slower rate, China,   and Germany add more to their GDP compared to India. China, growing at 6.5 per cent annually, added $1.2 trillion to its GDP last (calendar) year. Similarly, US added $838 billion even by growing at just 2.3 per cent while Germany grew just 2.1 per cent but added $283 billion in 2017. The figure for India was $215 billion at 7.4 per cent. The calendar year (January 1 - December 31) has been taken into account to have an apple- to- apple comparison, since different countries follow different fiscal calendars. For instance, while India follows an April - March financial year, US follows an October - September format.
 
 If India wants to add as much as China to its GDP, it needs a GDP growth rate of a whopping 40 per cent. The rate of growth required to add as much as US is 29% per cent and that for Germany is 10 per cent.
