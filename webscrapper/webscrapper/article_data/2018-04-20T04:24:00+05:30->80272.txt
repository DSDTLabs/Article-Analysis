AHMEDABAD; When Childline, children’s helpline on 1098, received a call earlier this year about  , they were surprised to know that the family involved was not ready to approach police or any other organization and also asked the   to leave.

 “We got to know that the perpetrator was none other than the child’s father himself. The incident was reported by a relative who was also later thrown out of the house for reporting the incident. The woman dared to approach us as she herself was victim of a similar abuse when she was young,” said an official.
 
 While the state reported high number of crimes against children in 2017, those working in the field say that the statistics might not give the true picture of the problem’s extent.
 
 Binal Patel, project coordinator, Childline, said that in majority of the abuse cases, it has been observed that the accused might be someone close to the victim. “It might be someone from the immediate or extended family, a neighbour or an acquaintance. The family many a time doesn’t want to disturb the equilibrium and instead decided to keep mum or promise to sort things out on their own,” she said.
 
 It is also about convincing families to approach police so as to deter habitual offenders.  , coordinator for 181 Abhayam helpline, said that in one of the recent complaints where a minor was raped by her brother’s friend, they had to tell the family not to be afraid of the consequences. “If such incidents are not reported, it might encourage the accused to seek other victims,” she said.
