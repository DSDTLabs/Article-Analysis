NEW DELHI: Prime Minister 
  that India cannot succeed in its mission for a clean country until people's mindset and attitudes toward 'swachhta' (cleanliness) don't change.

  "The Swachh Bharat Mission is about both 'vyavastha' (preparation) and 'vichar' (thought process and mindset)," said Modi in a speech on the third anniversary of the Mission at Delhi's Vigyan Bhawan.
 
  The PM said he believes that if the country’s 125 crore citizens come together as one, no mission is impossible. 
 
  “Even if ,1000 Mahatma Gandhis, 1 lakh Modis, all chief ministers and all state governments come together the dream for a clean India can never be fulfilled, but if 125 crore Indians come together that dream will come true,” said the PM.
 
  Modi emphasised that all humans appreciate cleanliness, but not everyone personally takes charge of it. That, he said, is where the gap in the dream lies.
 
  "Nobody denies the need for cleanliness, but we don't want to do it ourselves. Instead of waiting for the government to create clean surroundings, people need to start involving themselves in the process," he said.
 
  The PM also cited a   report that surveyed 10,000 families and found that those who did not build toilets or pay attention to cleanliness, spent atleast Rs 50,000 annually on disease-related expenditure, in the form of medicines, lost income, loans, and other things.
 
  Modi praised the "positive spirit of competition" that has been created with the Swachh Bharat Mission.
 
  "We see this in the cleanliness rankings and in how organisations are working towards hygiene," PM Modi said.
