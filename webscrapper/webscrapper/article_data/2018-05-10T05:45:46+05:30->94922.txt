CHENNAI:   have launched a hunt for a suspect, Karthik, 32, for murdering a 34-year-old man after chasing him on a busy road in full   at   on Wednesday. Inquiries revealed that Karthik murdered M Dileep Kumar for filing a police complaint against him in connection with a petty quarrel. The suspect, Karthik, was involved in the murder of ‘Yamaha’ Balaji in Thirumullaivoyal last year.

 The victim, M Dileep, was said to be riding a motorbike near his house at NSK Nagar, Aminjikarai, around 5pm when he was intercepted by an armed group. “Even as he left his bike behind and started running, the gang chased him down and repeatedly stabbed him in the back and head,” said a police officer.
 
 Dileep’s family members said Karthik was having previous enmity with Dileep since last December when there was a petty quarrel over Dileep teasing Karthik’s 12-year-old nephew. Police said Karthik came out on bail in April and they suspect that he planned to kill Dileep for revenge.
 
 Police said the gang managed to flee from the spot in motorbikes. Dileep was rushed to the Kilpauk medical college and hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The police said Dileep sustained four knife marks on his head and three deep cuts in his back. Police registered a case and launched a hunt for the suspects.
