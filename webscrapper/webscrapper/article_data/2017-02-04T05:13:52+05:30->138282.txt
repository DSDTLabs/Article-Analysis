NEW DELHI: The   ( ) has suspended two electrical engineers of   for keeping the lights on of a taxiway that was not in use, due to which an aircraft wrongly entered that bay while it was not supposed to.

 The regulator found this as a major cause of the February 1 incident at IGI airport when an IndiGo aircraft wrongly entered a taxiway where a   aircraft was already parked and then an alarmed air traffic control had to tell the IndiGo pilots to apply brakes to avoid colliding with the other plane.
 
 “The distance between the IndiGo and Jet aircraft was much less than 30 metres. The IndiGo pilots and electrical engineers of Delhi airport were found responsible for this episode. The electrical engineers kept lights on of a taxiway that was not supposed to be used due to which the pilots entered the wrong taxiway. But the pilots, by doing so, entered the runway and they should have looked to their left and right also to see what they were doing,” said a senior DGCA official.
 
 The regulator has grounded the IndiGo pilots and suspended the two engineers.
