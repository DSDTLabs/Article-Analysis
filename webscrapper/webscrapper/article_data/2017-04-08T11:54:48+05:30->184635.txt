LUDHIANA: Two buffaloes were stolen from a stable in   village on Thursday. Kuldeep  , 28, who works in a private firm, said in his police complaint, "There were five buffaloes, including two of my uncle,  , and a cow in our stable. Like any other day, I locked the stable around 10.30pm on Wednesday." 

 Kuldeep further said, "The next day around 5am, I was shocked to see the stable locks broken and two of the buffaloes missing. One of them was of my uncle. I looked for them everywhere, but to no avail."
 
 Suspecting it to be the handiwork of a villager, he said, "Most of the Jaspal Bangar residents have buffaloes and they keep them at their houses. But we have lodged our cattle at the stable which is at a distance from our house. That, perhaps, made them an easy target. Each   cost around Rs 70,000." 
 
 Police registered a case . Two years ago, too, two of Kuldeep's buffaloes were stolen.
