AHMEDABAD:   on Friday issued a notice to the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Centre over a PIL demanding that   must submit all proofs regarding the details they furnish in  .

 Petitioner advocate K R Koshti has urged the high court to ensure that contesting candidates must be asked to submit all documents – degree certificates, details of bank statements etc – in support of any averments made in affidavit and nomination form. The PIL was filed ahead of polls for a few   seats in Gujarat.
 
 The high court has asked the authorities to file their reply by July 20.
 
 Advocate Koshti’s petition reads, “Today, candidate nomination form and affidavit for a large number of contesting candidates is a fortress of lie with incomplete, misleading information, bogus education and asset declarations. Many of these candidates win elections to become law-makers for our country.”
 
 Referring the case of Delhi law minister Jitendra Singh Tomar’s fake law degree, the PIL stated that voters, the tax-payers of the country, remain ignorant and eventually live in agony. “Under these circumstances, a nation cannot make progress when lawmakers build their fundamentals on fortress of lies and entire system protects them. The truth has become irrelevant in today’s time and there is hopelessness everywhere and trust on election commission is irreparably broken,” the petitioner submitted further.
 
 The petitioner stated that he has made representations before the ECI and chief electoral officer of Gujarat in this regard, but he did not get any response.
 
 Ahead of elections for three Rajya Sabha seats, the petitioner has also sought interim directions to concerned authorities to command the proposed candidates to supply the necessary documents in support of the averments made in their affidavits along with the nomination paper.
