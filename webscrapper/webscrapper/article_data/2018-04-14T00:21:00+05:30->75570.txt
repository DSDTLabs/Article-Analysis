Coimbatore: The city is all set to turn the centenary celebrations of Tamil cinema into a memorable one by showcasing its links with the Kollywood and screening 18 iconic movies in as many days, starting Friday (April 14). It would be a rare opportunity for one to get engrossed in classic films such as Parashakthi,  

 “The first film made in Tamil Nadu, Keechaka Vadham, was released in 1918, making this year the centenary,” said S Aravindan, 30, of Clusters Media College, which would organise the film festival on its campus at Hopes, Peelamedu.
 
 The event, he said, took shape when they were researching on a postgraduate course on film technology. “We came across several bits of film history, which throws light into Coimbatore’s connection with the Tamil film industry. We wanted to showcase the same and planned the event,” Aravindan said.
 
 Pointing out that locations of MGR’s blockbuster movie Malaikkallan can still be seen in the city, he said, “There is a spot near Nirmala College, where the film was shot. Even today, the spot is in the same state. We have collected details about the places in the city where important films were made. We will display such anecdotes as an exhibition on Tamil cinema history. The exhibition will also feature old cameras and film posters.”
 
 The curtains for the film festival and exhibition would go up at Clusters Media College on Friday at 10am.
 
 Aravindan said they have invited the families and descendants of film makers, owners of production houses and theatres to the event. “We met the children of those who started big production houses such as Pakshiraja Studios and Jupiter pictures in Coimbatore. We are planning to felicitate them at the event,” he said.
