NAVI MUMBAI: The general body has finally approved the administration’s proposal of resurfacing the 9.4-km long, 6-lane   using   at a cost of Rs 7.86 crore. The technology is said to be cost effective and eco-friendly.

 The plan had been put aside more than once by the elected representatives and the arterial road had not been repaired for close to a decade. Civic chief   said, “The new technology will be two-third of the cost estimated for conventional method of asphalting. This will be carried out as pilot project.”
 
 The administration will now float tenders in a week so that work can be completed before the monsoon.
 
 Micro-surfacing is a protective seal coat which extends the roads’ life. It’s a thin layer of asphalt emulsion blended with finely-crushed stone for traction which seals minor cracks, pores and other irregularities. The entire stretch from   headquarters signal, Belapur to Jyotiba Phule signal, Vashi will be resurfaced without disturbing traffic.
 
 “The asphalt resurfacing material is designed to be applied in a semi-liquid condition with a specialized mixing and paving machine. It chemically changes from a semi-liquid material to a dense cold mix material that is able to sustain traffic load two hours after application,” said  , city engineer.
 
 In fact, Cidco, before handing over the road to NMMC, had done the surfacing work in 2007 at a cost of Rs 14 crore. Since then no major work has been taken up on this arterial road, known as Navi Mumbai’s Marine Drive. 
 
 The civic body had estimated the cost of manual repairing through asphalting at Rs 21 crore, including the inflation in 10 years, and the new technology is a viable alternative at Rs 7.86 crore. Dagaonkar added that the technology has a guarantee of 5 years. “One does not need to dig up existing layer to put up micro-surfacing. We will take up the work lane-wise without disturbing traffic movement.”
