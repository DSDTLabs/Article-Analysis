Tirupur: An 80-year-old man has launched an indefinite mute protest at his house in the city, demanding that the state government should make Tamil the medium of instruction in schools. Octogenarian K Muthusamy of Karuvampalayam has also placed a picture of Saint-poet Tiruvalluvar in front of the house. Since he communicates only by writing and using sign language, Muthusamy’s wife Subbulakshmi explained about his cause. “Muthusamy, who is known as ‘Titoni’ Muthusamy, worships the mother tongue. Though he could study only up to class VII, he groomed himself by reading Tamil literature. He was running an export-oriented knitwear manufacturing unit. He always took part in social activities and had participated in a protest urging the government to declare Tamil as a classical language in Delhi,” she told TOI. Muthusamy was worried seeing the young generation losing interest in Tamil and embracing English, Subbulakshmi said. “Despite knowing that the mother-language was the best medium, the society was rapidly switching over to English. Due to societal pressure, some of our five grandchildren could not continue their studies in Tamil medium beyond class V. He wanted to change the situation where the society will rate Tamil medium high and the way to go, right from primary education to higher education,” she said. Her husband launched the protest on March 24, on his 80th birthday, after taking an oath in front of a palm tree — Tamil Nadu’s state tree — in Tirumurugan Poondi, Subbulakshmi said. “He would continue the mute protest till the state government makes Tamil medium mandatory in all schools.”
