NAGPUR: Though vice-chancellor SP Kane had promised to   the   fee if marks increase or decrease, students may not get their money back anytime soon. 

 On Saturday, director of board of examinations and evaluation   admitted that the promise to students remains unfulfilled nearly a year later of being made. “On October 7, the matter would be put up before the board of examinations. After that, the management council would consider it followed by the finance and accounts section,”   said.
 
 Exam section officials said that this is a long drawn process and students clearing next week would not be able to make a refund claim.
 
 Over the years, youth wings of political organizations and aggrieved students have been demanding that the Nagpur   should refund their fees in case of change in result.
 
 Students had to cough up Rs 150 per paper as revaluation fee while seeking photocopy of answersheet. Maximum assessment of two papers can be challenged. Earlier, the fee would come to Rs 450 with the photocopy costing Rs 150 each. As a precaution, the students would also fill exam form that would cost another Rs 500 to Rs 1000.
 
 NU officials said that eligible students would be refunded from the date when the finance and accounts section clears the proposal and not when the VC made the promise. “The decision won’t be applied in retrospect. Financial affairs of the university are complicated and it is not easy to refund any fee. Therefore, it would take some time to chalk out a plan,” they said.
