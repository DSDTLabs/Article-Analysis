BHUBANESWAR: The Puri Shankaracharya,  , on Sunday sought a thorough probe into the circumstances that led to the disappearance of the keys of the Jagannath Temple's inner treasury. 

 The treasury of the world-famous shrine has two chambers - inner and outer. On April 5, Puri collector Aravind Agarwal revealed that the district administration did not possess the keys to the inner treasury. This came a day after a 16-member team of experts desisted from opening the shrine's locked inner treasury to conduct a structural assessment. The inner treasury was last opened in 1985. 
 
 "I am shocked that the keys of the inner treasury are missing. How did this happen? A thorough probe is needed," the Shankaracharya told the media in Puri. As per the written minutes of a recent meeting of the temple managing committee, Puri king Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb also expressed shock over the missing keys.
 
 Political parties have also turned the heat on the state government for its alleged negligence towards the development of the temple. Congress state president Niranjan Patnaik, who called on the Puri Shankaracharya on Sunday, said the BJD government was handling temple affairs very inefficiently. "Neither the temple administration, nor the state government is committed towards ensuring the development of the temple," he said.
