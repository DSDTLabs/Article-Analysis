MOHALI: Pruning the trees has become a headache for the municipal corporation, for it is short of equipment. The residents have to tolerate the overgrown trees, the branches of which hide the road signs, cover the streetlights, and block sunlight. 

  municipal commissioner   said his office was aware of these obstacles in the path of traffic but the work of pruning was delayed for want of proper equipment. “The workers of the horticulture department are finding it difficult to cut these trees without the help of machines. We have contacted the   to find out how they manage it and to see if they can outsource any machinery to us until we float a tender and hire a company for the cutting job,” he said.
 
 Municipal councillor   said: “The trees at many places have grown beyond 40 feet, and the long branches pose a risk to the commuters. If the   is unable to trim the branches by a machine, I should get it done manually.” Councillor   said: “Recently, two overgrown trees fell over vehicles parked outside a house in Phase VI. Had those trees been trimmed in time, the accident could have been avoided. The MC should respond quickly before a similar accident occurs.”
 
 The residents of Phases 3B2 and V said the overgrown branches had covered streetlights for months and lodging ab online complaint with the MC hadn’t helped.  , who lives in Phase 3B2, said: “The area’s roadside trees need quick pruning so that streetlights can illuminate the roads and commuting at night is safer.”
 
 In Phase V, daily commuter   said: “A branch brushed my helmet a few days ago on a road that was dark because the overgrown branches of the trees have covered all the streetlights.”
