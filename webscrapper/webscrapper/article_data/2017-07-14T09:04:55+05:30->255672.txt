KOCHI: Fresh spell of heavy rains in central and north Kerala on Thursday brought hopes of more showers amid concerns over 24% deficient rainfall between June 1 and July 12.

 The southwest   has been weak in the state over the past few days. Lakshadweep, however, recorded an excess of 41% rainfall.
 
 The weather department said strong winds from north-westerly direction, occasionally touching speeds of 45-55 kmph, were likely along and off the Kerala coast and over Lakshadweep during the next 24 hours.
 
 “There’s a low pressure forming in the Bay of Bengal and it is expected to bring rains to different parts of north Kerala. However, south Kerala has not received much rains,” S Sudevan, regional director of the Indian meteorological department, said.
 
 Wayanad, meanwhile, continued to be largely deficient this monsoon at 63% while Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad, Malappuram, Idukki and Kannur remained deficient.
 
 The deficient rainfall in the remaining districts could be overcome with good showers for a couple of days.
 
  Sudevan said the setting up of a Doppler radar in Kochi would help providing information for the immediate few hours, contrary to the 24 hours advance information.
 
 The radar could soon be used by people with smart phones to check whether it would rain during the next couple of hours, he said.
 
 The radar would help in better estimation of rainfall with detection of heavy rains and generation of warnings. IMD officials said the radar could provide area-specific rainfall and storm warnings, beneficial for aviation-related services, disaster management and emergency response authorities.
