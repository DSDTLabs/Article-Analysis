Ahmedabad: A 52-year-old brain dead man will give a new lease of life to five people, as his family decided to donate his heart, kidneys, liver and eyes.The heart could not be transplanted, however, as some issues were later discovered in it.

 Ajit Chaurasia, who was a pan shop owner and a resident of Vejalpur area, met with an accident near Thaltej Crossroads when he was going home on his two-wheeler on Thursday. A cow suddenly came in his way, he lost balance and fell while trying to avoid hitting the animal. He was rushed to a nearby private hospital in a critical condition.
 
 Dr Harsha Parikh, medical director of SAL Hospital in Thaltej, where Chaurasia was taken first, said that the patient’s pulse rate and blood pressure were below normal when arrived. “It became clear in the primary medical investigation and CT scan reports that he had suffered severe brain injuries which had resulted in haemorrhage and internal bleeding. Our doctors tried to revive him but his condition continued to deteriorate. As his family learned about the situation, they approached us saying that they wanted to donate his organs after his death,” Parikh said.
 
 As Chaurasia succumbed on Saturday, hospital staff started the   procedure. “His liver will be transplanted at IKDRC (Institute of Kidney Disease and Research Centre), kidneys at SAL Hospital and corneas (from his eyes) will be donated at Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation-run Nagri Hospital,” she said.
 
 Chaurasia’s family chose to stay away from the media and were emotional about the organ donation. His heart was supposed to be transplanted at Sterling Hospital in Memnagar, but that could not be performed.
 
 “The heart was slated to be transplanted in a 62-year-old end-stage cardiac failure patient from Mehsana, but was not possible as the donor’s heart was found to have cardiac disease with blockages in the arteries,” said regional director of Sterling Hospital, Dr Nikhil Lala.
