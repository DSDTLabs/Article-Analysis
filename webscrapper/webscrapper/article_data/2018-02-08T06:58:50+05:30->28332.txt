KOLKATA:   has slipped from 101-110 rank in the   to 127 this year. The rankings were released on Wednesday. 

 Among the five parameters on which JU was adjudged by the body were citations, industry income, international outlook, research and teaching. Incidentally, popular perception was a sub-criterion in at least two of these five parameters.
 
  
  
 
 Sources pointed out that much like the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) which has a separate parameters on peer perception and popular perception, Times   Asia University Rankings has popular perception as a sub-criterion.
 
 "Last year, JU's rank was between 101 and 110. This year, we have dropped a couple of ranks.  , only Punjab University - which too is a state- run university - is ahead of JU at 114 rank," pointed out the source.
 
 In the current rank, JU's overall score is 30.5. The university scored 38.6 in industry income, 14.9 in international outlook, 22.5 in research and 39 in teaching.
 
  "Popular perception means how the broader section perceives the institution. Stability, governance and research is taken into account along with maintenance of normalcy and peer perception," a source said.
 
 Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das, who is on a month-long leave, is aware of the development. Though   expressed satisfaction at JU's performance, he was concerned about the lower rankings accorded to most Indian institutions compared to last year. "This is disturbing. It needs to be addressed jointly by the Centre and the state, along with the leading education institutions," Das said.
 
 Calcutta University too slid and is now ranked between 201-250. Last year, CU was positioned between 101 and 200. CU scored 39.2 in teaching, followed by industry income (33.5), research (16) and international outlook (14.6).
