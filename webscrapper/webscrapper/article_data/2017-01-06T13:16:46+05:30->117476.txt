 The team, led by Dr  , looked into ways of starting the unit in private wards on the fourth floor of the hospital, official sources said. They looked into the layout of the area and assessed whether rooms would be able to hold the bone marrow transplant facility, they said.
 
 The team is expected to submit a report on is findings with the state medical education department.
 
 "The facility is expected to come up by May-June this year," Dr Sanjay Dixit, secretary of Indore Society for Organ Donation, told TOI.
 
 This will be first bone marrow transplantation facility in Madhya Pradesh. It will bring down the cost of the procedure by over 70 per cent. The new centre will come up with funds from the Centre to the tune of Rs 6.5 crore. The   had sent the proposal for the centre to the state government. Authorities have also identified a team of expert doctors who will operate the facility and perform the transplant.
 
 "At present, the bone marrow transplant costs around Rs 30 lakh to Rs 70 lakh. Once the facility is up and running at MY Hospital, the cost may drop to Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh," Dr Dixit said. 
 
 The centre will benefit patients suffering from diseases like myeloid leukemia (blood cancer), sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia, he said.
 
 Dr Dixit said the bone marrow transplant could be carried out after conducting specialised tests like human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing to match donor and patient.
