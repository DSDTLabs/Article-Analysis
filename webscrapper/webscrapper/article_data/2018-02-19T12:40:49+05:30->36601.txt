NEW DELHI: Amid profit-booking by speculators,   prices fell Rs 85 to Rs 38,580 per kg in futures trade today. However, a firm trend in the precious metals overseas, capped the losses.

  At the Multi Commodity Exchange, silver for delivery in March lost Rs 85, or 0.22 per cent, to Rs 38,580 per kg, in a business turnover of 431 lots. In the international market, silver rose 0.24 per cent to USD 16.66 an ounce in Singapore today. Traders said the fall in silver prices in futures trade was largely due to profit-booking by participants.
