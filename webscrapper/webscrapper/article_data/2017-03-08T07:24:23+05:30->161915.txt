HYDERABAD: Here’s a positive note on Women’s Day. The family health survey by the Union ministry of women and child development has found that more women are actively participating in household decisions than before.

 About 82% urban women and 80% rural women in Telangana feel they are equal members when it comes to taking decisions for the family.   too showed a similar trend, with 78.8% urban women and 80.4% rural women active participants. Again, states in the   were better placed, with 97% women in Assam saying yes in the survey.
 
 The survey also found a slight fall in domestic violence. It revealed that 36.9% married women experienced spousal violence in urban areas as against 47% in rural areas.
 
 However, this doesn’t mean that all is okay. One in four women still experience domestic violence. This, say women activists, is related to an increase in their decision-making powers. “Women are more independent now, and men with traditional mindsets are upset. Hence, the violence,” said activist Rama S.
