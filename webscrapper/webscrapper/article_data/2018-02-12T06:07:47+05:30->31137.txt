KOLKATA: The south Kolkata school, from where a dance teacher was arrested on Friday for allegedly molesting a Class-II girl, on Sunday cancelled its annual picnic slated for Monday and announced that normal classes would be held instead. 

 The same day, guardians of the four south Kolkata institutes, from where allegations of sexual harassment against students had surfaced over the past three months, submitted a petition to the police on Sunday, seeking thorough investigation and harsh punishment for the accused.
 
 Around 11am, the guardians, including the parents of the two girls allegedly abused on the campus last week, submitted the memorandum at the   police station. “We have sought the harshest punishment for the accused. We also requested them to ensure that the girls’ identity is never disclosed either by the school or anyone else, like it happened in the assault case of the lower-nursery student in which two PT teachers were arrested. The officers promised us cooperation,” said the guardian at the school, where a dance teacher was arrested.
 
 Though the school put up a notice, announcing normal classes from Monday, some parents were not sure whether to send their wards or not. “There might be protests from some guardians. Also, a number of people might visit the school and that might affect the ambience. I want to see how things go for the next few days and take a call,” said a Class-I student’s mother.
 
 Among the anxious parents were the guardians of the Class-II girl, based on whose complaint the dance teacher was arrested on Friday. He will be produced in court on Monday after being in the Tollygunge police station lock-up for two nights. “My daughter is still in trauma and I don’t want to send her to school now,” she said.
 
 Father Dominic Gomes, vicar-general, The  , said their representatives would visit the school on Monday and speak to the principal and other teachers as part of an inquiry.
