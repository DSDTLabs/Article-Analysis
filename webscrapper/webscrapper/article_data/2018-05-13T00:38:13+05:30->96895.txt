NEW DELHI: Alleging harassment and indiscriminate action against the hawkers during the ongoing SC-mandated anti-encroachment drive, National Association of Street   - umbrella body of street vendors -has called for a protest rally and a day-long bandh on street vending on Monday. The protest march will be taken to   office. 

 Vendor unions alleged that they are being targeted primarily in the drive, while the judgment in   case was directed at bigger encroachers.   argued that continuous eviction is going on in violation of Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. 
 
 "The act makes it clear that street vending is a right, it is legal and arbitrary evictions cannot take place. However, in spite of such an act being in force, police officials and the municipal bodies are violating the act. Vendors are at the receiving end - their goods are mostly seized or destroyed," said Arbind Singh, national convener of NASVI said.
 
 He added that it unjustifiable to remove the street vendors when the same civic body is in the middle of preparing electoral rolls for the setting up of town vending committees. "Now that everyone is being thrown out and harassed, what sort of surveys will these committees do when they are formed?" Singh said.
 
 Vendors have pointed out several alleged irregularities in the action being taken against them, which include removal of vendors with tehbazari certificates, destruction of property using earthmover, not returning the seized items, harassment and disregard for vendors' rights as per Street Vendors Act, 2014.
 
 Senior corporation officials, however, argued the delay in returning the seized items, although not mentioned in DMC act, is being done to prevent the repeat offenders from returning back to their sites.
 
 There are an estimated five lakh street vendors in Delhi.
