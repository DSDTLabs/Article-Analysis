LUCKNOW: With Lucknow being one of the biggest cities contributing to  , the   ( ) is set to build two new plants, both in cis- and trans-Gomti areas, to manufacture bricks and tiles using construciton waste. 

 The city produces more than 1,500-2,000 tonne construction waste every day comprising waste of bricks, cement, mortar, stones etc. 
 
 The building waste materials are major contributors to pollution and their heaps on roadsides also hinder traffic movement. 
 
 Since there is no identified spot in the city for dumping construction waste, LMC vehicles usually dump them in pits and open areas.
 
  Those who need the waste to level uneven land or cover up pits can buy it from LMC too. But since these measures are not a permanent solution, LMC has decided to set up plants which could use this waste to manufacture bricks and tiles. 
 
 Municipal commissioner   told TOI, "LMC is ready to float the tender for the plants by next week. These will be set up in both cis- and trans-Gomti areas. We have identified a few lands of around 4 acre each to set up the plant. Here the construction waste will be dumped, to be later used to manufacture bricks and tiles." LMC is currently making the bid document.
 
  The project will be run on   (public-private partnership) model where the company running the plants will give a certain percentage of revenue generated to LMC every year. 
 
 "Either two different companies will be selected for cis- and trans-Gomti, or one company can be selected for both plants. This will depend on the merit of bids. The move will help in getting the city pollution free," said official in-charge of the project.
