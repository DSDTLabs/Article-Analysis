CHENNAI:   chief minister O   on Monday urged Prime Minister Narendra   to promulgate an   immediately to enable the conduct of   (bull taming) during the   festival.

 In a letter to the Prime Minister, Panneerselvam said there was no action yet from central government on the suggestions of the state government in the issue. 
 
 “Given that the Pongal festival which holds great importance to the people of Tamil Nadu is less than a week away and jallikattu is an integral part of the Pongal festivities, the Government of India should consider promulgating an ordinance removing the legal impediments enabling the conduct of jallikattu during Pongal,” he said.
 
 Considering the groundswell of sentiment and support for the conduct of jallikattu all over Tamil Nadu, this is an issue on which the Centre should act, the chief minister added.
 
 He recalled the steps taken by the state government in the Supreme Court against the traditional sport. “As you are aware, jallikattu is conducted as part of the Pongal festival in which bulls that are reared exclusively for this event are embraced by able-bodied youth. Jallikattu is deeply ingrained as part of the cultural tradition of Tamil Nadu, as a sport popular among warriors since the Sangam era. This 2000-year-old traditional sport finds a mention in the ancient Tamil text Silapathigaram,” he said.
 
 The Supreme Court banned jallikattu and also held that bulls could not be used as performing animals either for jallikattu events or for bullock cart races in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and other states in the country. The court also struck down as ultra-vires the state act passed in 2009.
 
 “The ban on jallikattu has caused widespread resentment and general disappointment among the people of Tamil Nadu, particularly in the rural areas, since it is intertwined with the religious and social cultural ethos of Tamil society,” the chief minister said.
