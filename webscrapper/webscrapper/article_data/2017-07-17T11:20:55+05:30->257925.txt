THIRUVANTHANTHAPURAM: The  's   to woo merchants to reduce the use of   hardly enthused the merchants with just four merchant groups handing over plastic carry bags which were stocked over the last few months in a collection drive held here on Saturday.

 The civic body has introduced a new system by which merchants can give back corporation their stock of plastic carry bags and corporation would deposit   in their bank accounts. The first collection drive as part of reverse returns policy was held at Putharikandam, Kesavadasapuram, near MG college, Karamana bridge, Sasthamangalam, Pippinmoodu junction, Technopark, Chackai Health inspector office and near Sreekariyam market. Only four groups turned up and handed over 300 kilos of plastic carry bags at the counters. Most of them were retail chains based at Nanthencode and Kesavadasapuram.
 
 `` The initial response has been dull. Maybe they were sceptical. Certainly, this is not the quantity of plastic stocked in shops in the city despite the ban,''   said. The civic body has worked out the financial plan in such a way that it will run this policy for no profit no loss. The corporation is paid Rs 15 per kilo by the Clean Kerala company for plastic carry bags which is shredded and given for road tarring. This amount will be directly passed on to the merchants.
 
  The civic body had to resort to this model after complaints were raised by merchants that they lost huge amount with corporationâ€™s seizure of plastic carry bags. In the wake of poor response for the first collection drive, the health wing has decided to conduct another collection drive exclusively for merchants in the coming weeks.
 
  Meanwhile, city residents continued to respond well to the collection drive. 10 tons of cleaned, dried plastic wastes were collected at various counters. In the past one year, the corporation has collected 235 tons of plastic in a year.
