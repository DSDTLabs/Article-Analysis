AHMEDABAD: More than 17 months after demonetization,   of Rs 1,000 and demonetized notes of Rs 500 are still being deposited in banks. In a complaint registered by   (SOG) of the city crime branch, a total of 3,359 fake currency notes were deposited in 17 different banks of the city. More disturbing is the fact that along with fake currency notes of Rs 2,000 and the new Rs 500 note, ‘children bank’ notes were also deposited.

 SOG officials said that in past three months 231 fake notes of Rs 2,000, 141 of Rs 500, 2,149 fake notes of Rs 100, 212 notes of Rs 50 , 4 of Rs 20 and 3 of Rs 10 were deposited in the banks.
 
 “137 fake demonetized currency notes of Rs 1,000 and 482 of Rs 500 were also deposited in the bank. We are probing how after 17 months of demonetization these currency notes were deposited in the banks. We asked for CCTV footage of the last three months from the banks to trace the persons who had deposited the money,” said an investigator.
