RANCHI: Civil society groups and activists campaigning for ‘Right to Food’ have taken a strong exception to the Centre’s decision to link Aadhaar with the   served in  . 

 Noted development economist and former member of the  , Jean Dreze, has described the move as detrimental to the right of children to food. Citing instances of Aadhaar linking with NREGA and PDS, which have deprived the economically backward sections from access to livelihood and food, Dreze said the decision of the government is in utter violation of the   order which states that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for welfare schemes.
 
 Those working in the field of food security believe that in the absence of internet coverage, electricity and technical know-how in rural India, the decision of the Centre is going to deprive the children of their right to free food in school. The midday meal has helped to retain students and also aided in enrolment. 
 
 The   campaign in Jharkhand has decided to file a case with the Supreme Court through its national body demanding an immediate moratorium on the Centre’s notification. RTF Jharkhand activist Balram said the linking of Aadhaar would eventually mean that every child would have to prove his or her credentials before receiving meals in schools. “The experiment with Aadhaar seeding in the case of NREGA and PDS is yet to become fool proof as many of the beneficiaries have fallen victim to technical lapses and in case students are denied meals at schools because of technical glitches, that would be appalling,” he said.
 
 RTF has issued a letter saying school meals are an important entitlement of children, legally enforceable under the Supreme Court as well as under the National Food Security Act. “No condition can be imposed on this critical entitlement of children. Making Aadhaar compulsory for the midday meal would serve no purpose,” the letter read.
