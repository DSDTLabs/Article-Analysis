 Grover was replying to the felicitation after being bestowed with lifetime achievement award by Engineers Forum for his remarkable contribution to development of atomic energy at Rani Kothi, Civil Lines. The theme of the Engineer’s Day programme was ‘Clean energy: A solution to global warming’. The programme began with the screening of a video clip based on the life of Bharat Ratna M Visvesvaraya. 
 
 Grover said that energy cannot be based on its sources. Reliability and supply of power is necessary for the masses to progress. Effects of global warming can be taken care of by producing clean energy. Though there are many technologies for better energy generation with less carbon emission, coal will continue to play a major role. Radiation due to nuclear energy causes no adverse effects on people as it is monitored by a regulatory committee.
 
 In his presidential address, AD Palamwar, former operational director of MSEDCL, said that coal is the backbone of power industry. Unless extensive use of thermal and nuclear energy is allowed for power generation and batteries become cheap, dependence on coal will continue. ‘Go solar, save polar’ was the mantra he gave on the occasion.
