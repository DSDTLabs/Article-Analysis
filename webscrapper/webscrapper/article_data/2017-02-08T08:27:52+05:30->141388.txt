BENGALURU: Two notorious rowdies are suspected to be behind last week's attempt on the life of history-sheeter and APMC president Kadabagere Srinivasa, police said. 

 The interrogation of Satish alias  , who was arrested on Sunday in another case of criminal intimidation, provided police leads in Srinivasa's case. Satish was a business associate of Srinivasa.
 
 According to police sources, Sunil alias Silent Sunil and KS Rohith alias Onte (camel) allegedly plotted the attempt on  's life. Both were picked up from near a hospital in south Bengaluru late on Tuesday evening.
 
 "It is no doubt a contract killing attempt. Silent Sunil and Onte Rohith are the masterminds. We are told that one of the two men was sitting inside a car barely 300 feet away from the spot where two bike-borne men fired at Srinivasa," police sources said. Satish had called Srinivasa's henchmen a few days ago and warned them. "You people better stop intervening in land dealings. Else, you will get it," sources quoted Satish as saying.
 
 Police began efforts to track Sunil and Rohith on Monday morning and were tipped off that underworld don-turned-social activist Agni Sridhar had sheltered them. "Sunil and Rohith are close associates of Sridhar and his right hand man,   alias   alias Bachchan, 54. We deployed cops in plainclothes near the houses of Sridhar and Bachchan in Kumarswamy Layout. We applied for a warrant to search Sridhar's house as suspicious activities were reported," sources said.
 
 Sunil and Rohith emerged as big names in the Benglauru underworld after they were accused of killing another rowdy, Bekkina Kannu Rajendra, in front of Chalukya Hotel.
