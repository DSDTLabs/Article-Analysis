MEERUT: Days after an unsuccessful self-immolation bid, a 47-year-old activist on Saturday tried to “drown” himself in a pit over his long-pending demand of re-opening of a railway crossing gate in city’s   crossing for commuters.

   , president of a local NGO, was “rescued” by the police.According to locals, the railway gate was closed about three months ago and commuters are now forced to use a nearby over-bridge as an alternative.
 
  Seeking re-opening of the gate, Chinoti had tried to immolate himself on April 24. However, police had rescued him.
  On Saturday, the activist dug up a six feet deep pit under the over-bridge and tried to “drown” himself in it. However, police officers who reached the spot after hearing the news described Chinoti’s attempt as a “drama”.
 
  After digging the pit, the activist took hours to fill it with water. When almost all the water poured by him into the pit was soaked, Chinoti brought a plastic sheet and put it into the pit. While he was pouring water into it, police arrived and rescued the activist again.
  Station in-charge of   police station,  , said, “This was more of a drama, because there was not even enough water to drench his feet, forget about the whole body.
 
  “Anyway, we rescued him from the pit he had dug to take ‘jal samadhi’ and handed him over to his relatives at the police station.”
  However, Chinoti accused police of making fun of him.
 
  “When I was taking ‘samadhi’, the policemen said I should go and get drowned in a public drain instead of in fresh water. So I immediately got out and started walking towards the nearby drain when they caught me,” he said.
