BENGALURU: Memories of last year's paper leak fiasco returned to haunt students taking the II PU exams on Monday when pictures of the accountancy question paper appeared on WhatsApp. At 12.30pm, exactly two hours after the exam began, deputy commissioner of Raichur, Gautham Bagadi, received information that the incident occurred in one of the centres under his jurisdiction. 

 Sidhana Goud, a part-time faculty member of   and Kalamath PU College in Raichur, tried to leak the accountancy paper after entering the exam centre in the guise of a flying-squad member. 
 
 The department of pre-university education was alerted that a miscreant had clicked photos of only a part of the question paper before circulating it on WhatsApp. 
 
 Goud entered the SRSVS PU College at 10.45am and clicked a photograph of a student's question paper during invigilation and sent the image via WhatsApp to Mahesh, principal of Kalinga PU College. At 11.30am, Mahesh sent the image to Sharana Basappa, the director of the same college. 
 
 Primary and secondary education minister Tanveer Sait said, "The question paper had 18 pages, of which only one page was photographed. We have confirmation that none of the students had received the message." While Kalinga PU College has lost its recognition, students pursuing I PU there will be relocated to other colleges, Sait added. 
 
 Vijay Rao, chief superintendent of the examination centrer, has been suspended and summoned for probe. "We have filed a case under section 26 of the Karnataka Education Act, and sections 120b and 72 of the IPC," added Sait. The minister further said that while the motive behind the leak was still unclear, the investigator will look into the larger plans the miscreants had. 
 
 Last year, the chemistry question paper for the PU board exams leaked twice, forcing the department to put in place a strict surveillance system this year to prevent such incidents.
