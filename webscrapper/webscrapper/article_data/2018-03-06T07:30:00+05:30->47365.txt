MOHALI: The   traffic police took a leap of two years and declared 2018 as a leap year in a challan, a blunder that was not noticed even when the offender’s father went to pay the fine.

 A traffic cop mentioned the challan disposal date as February 29, 2018. When the violator’s father approached the challan payment window on February 28, he was asked to come the next day.
 
 Mukesh Bharwal, a resident of Phase VII, said when he read the challan slip issued to his son for riding a motorcycle without valid documents, he was surprised to find the challan date as “February 29, 2018”. Confused over when to approach the challan disposal window,   had another experience when he reached the disposal window.
 
 Bharwal said, “I was unsure whether it was to be disposed by February 28 or March 1, because February 29, 2018 would never come. Finally, I approached   on February 28. But he took a look at the challan and told me to come tomorrow.” “When he realised the mistake, he said it was a small issue and told me that I could deposit the amount today itself,” Bharwal said.
 
 The challan slip issued to the violator also did not mention the challan spot and the time of challan, which are mandatory for the challan issuing officer to mention.
 
 However, defending the act of the cop, Mohali deputy superintendent of police (traffic) G P   said, “There is nothing serious in it. It is just an error.”
