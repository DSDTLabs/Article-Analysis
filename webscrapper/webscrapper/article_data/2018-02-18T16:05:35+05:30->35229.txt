 Comfortable chic yet sassy.

 
  Good pair of jeans, a black ganji, white sneakers, mom’s saree for those special occasions, and a well-fitted dress.

  Pick interesting cuts and comfortable yet chic designs.
 
  Always keep your hands and feet well-groomed and get a good hair cut – simple yet smart.
 
  When low, use clothes to your benefit – wear something bright.
 
 
 I’m extremely curious and need clarity. So yes, we do tend to get into healthy discussions.
