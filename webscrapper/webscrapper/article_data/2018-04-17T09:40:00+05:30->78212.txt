LUCKNOW: Barely a week after a committee set up on court orders designated two spots for protests in the city, hundreds of protesters demanding appointment in police gheraoed the police recruitment board office on   on Monday, throwing traffic out of gear and causing a massive jam. 

 When police canecharged the protesters, they ran towards   head office and GPO causing further chaos. As a result, vehicular movement remained disrupted on VS Marg for three hours, from 9.30am to 12.30pm. Office-goers, passengers going to railway station, airport and even ambulances were caught in the chaos. The cascading effect of the jam was visible at   crossing, near Darul Shafa, Lalbagh, Kaiserbagh,   and Rana Pratap Marg.
 
 Shashank Singh, a resident of Mahanagar who had to board a train for Kolkata from Charbagh, said that it took him one hour to go from Ashok Marg to Vidhan Sabha. Paritosh, who was returning from   station after receiving a guest, was stranded for over an hour on VS Marg.
 
 "I was going to see my ailing uncle in KGMU, but was stuck in traffic. It took me an hour going from Hazratganj crossing to Parivartan Chowk," said Ambuj Dixit, a resident of Gomtinagar.
 
 ASP (traffic) RS Nim said that the sudden gathering of hundreds of protesters created a blockade on VS Marg. "Traffic was disrupted only for few minutes and the protesters dispersed on being lathicharged," said the ASP.
