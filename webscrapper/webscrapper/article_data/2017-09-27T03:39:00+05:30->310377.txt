Margao: With a dual purpose of addressing the problem of illegal handcarts mushrooming in the city, and to lend a sense of aesthetics to the proposed vendors’ zone, the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) has decided to have a uniform architectural design for handcarts and kiosks operating within city limits. Towards that end, the MMC has decided to invite expressions of interest from architects/artists/designers to design a kiosk and a handcart in two categories – a design maintaining the cultural heritage and matching the aesthetics of the rich architectural heritage of Margao city, and a modular design conforming to modern architectural sensibilities.  Addressing mediapersons on Tuesday, MMC chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai said that the prize for the best design in each category would be Rs 50,000. TOI had pointed out in its edition dated September 23 that MMC has been receiving a number of complaints from the public against mobile handcart hawkers for causing obstructions to the flow of traffic in the town, leading to traffic bottlenecks. MMC’s chief officer Agnelo Fernandes, while acknowledging the problem, had pointed out that the civic body was in the process of identifying areas to be designated as vending zones, following which the roadside vendors selling fast food items would be relocated to these vending zones.  While there are 152 licensed handcarts in the city, an equal number of handcarts are plying their trade on the sly. The latest move is expected to put an end to illegal handcarts and kiosks.
