VISAKHAPATNAM: Sacred groves, a garden of herbal and medicinal plants including some rare and endangered species, was inaugurated in the government-run Rani Chandramani Devi (RCD) Hospital on Saturday. The initiative has been taken by a city-based green organisation. 

 In this programme, Dolphin Nature Conservation Society (DNCS) has taken an initiative to collect and rear plants such as Neem, Peepal, Banyan, Bilva, Medi, Moduga, Christmas tree and create awareness about these plants which are usually found in religious places.
 
 S Pavani, secretary of DNCS said, “The society has grouped more than 100 different species of plants under the headings Vinayaka Vana – 21 plants,   – 27 plants, Raasi Vana – 12 plants,   – 9 plants, Saptharishi Vana – 7 plants – that includes a total of 76 different species. Some nakshatras (stars) have more than two plant species also. Among these, some are rare and endangered, for example Swetarca, Catechu, Vanne Sandra, Red Sanders, Sandal Wood, Naga Kesari, Guggilam Flame of the Forest (Butea monosperma).”
 
 “DNCS is rearing all these plants in a small model garden which can be expanded into vast stretch of land for tourist attraction. In fact this is unique and first of its kind in this smart city,” said M Rama Murty, president of DNCS and organiser of the programme. 
 
 On Saturday, Vizag MP K   inaugurated the sacred groves programme by planting Swetarca sapling.
