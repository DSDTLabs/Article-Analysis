ERODE: A sick female elephant was reunited with its calf following the timely treatment by forest officials and veterinarians at   in   (STR) on Sunday. 

 Villagers who found the 20-year-old elephant collapse due to dehydration tried to revive it by giving water and food. As there was no reaction from the animal, they informed the forest officials, who in turn informed veterinary doctors. 
 
 A team of veterinarians led by Dr Manoharan and forest officials reached to the spot. "The elephant fell sick after it didn't have sufficient water and fodder," a forest official said. 
 
 They administered vitamin injection and glucose to the animal. "We administered vitamins to the elephant following which it got its conscious," Manoharan said. 
 
 Meanwhile, a calf elephant came to the spot where its mother was being treated. The veterinarians allowed the calf to help the mother elephant to recover from its sick. "The calf kept pushing the mother elephant. At one stage, the mother elephant rose up from the ground," a forest official said. Forest officials also helped the elephant to rise using an earth mover. 
 
 The veterinarians gave water and fruit to the calf as well. Around 6pm, the mother elephant went inside the forest with its calf. The forest officials said that they are monitoring both the jumbos in the forest.
