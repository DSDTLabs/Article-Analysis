Lucknow: The new session for undergraduate courses began on July 17 but the authorities have yet not made any arrangements to resume the discontinued   facility at the six boys’ hostels of LU. On April 19, the university decided to discontinue the mess facility in all boys’ hostels following indiscipline and violence.

 The university had then assured of a central mess facility for boys. However, no tender has been floated for the mess catering and the building work is still incomplete. Even for individual hostel mess, no in-charge has been appointed. LU had declared that there would be a centralised mess with the biometric attendance and CCTV cameras in the new session.
