Dhanush’s highly anticipated international project ‘The Extraordinary Journey of The Fakir’ will have its world premiere in Paris. According to reports, the film is all set to hit the screens at the Grand Rex tomorrow (May 22).

 Taking it to Twitter, an elated   said, “The Fakir comes to Paris. First stop in the extraordinary journey. Come meet me, @kenscottfakir and @BereniceBejo at the Grand Rex on the 22nd.” Ever since its inception, ‘The Extraordinary Journey of The Fakir’ has created great buzz among fans.
 
 In fact, it raised our expectations after the makers released its trailer on YouTube sometime earlier this year. On the other hand, Dhanush walked the red carpet at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival 2018, where the ‘Aadukalam’ star was seen promoting his maiden   venture.
 
 The film is inspired by the novel ‘The Extraordinary Journey of The Fakir’ Who Got Trapped in an Ikea Wardrobe, which was released in 2014. Set in Mumbai, the film is tipped to be an adventure drama that tells the story of Ajatashatru (Dhanush), who sets on a mission to find his missing father. Directed by Ken Scott, the film stars Bérénice Bejo, Barkhad Abdi and   in prominent roles.
 
 A Tamil dubbed version titled ‘Vazhaiya Thedi Naanum Poren’ is expected to release in   sometime in July.
