CHANDIGARH: Senior leader and media incharge of the   Randeep Singh   on Wednesday accused chief minister   of protecting the accused in the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) cash-for-jobs scam. “Youth of the state will never pardon the BJP government for this sin. If the CM does not order an inquiry by two sitting judges of the Punjab and Haryana high court within 24 hours, it will be clear that the kingpins of the scam have flourished under the protection of the CM,” he alleged.

 The Kaithal MLA said in such an eventuality it was the responsibility of the Prime Minister to immediately dismiss Khattar. Surjewala said this while addressing thousands of youths who had assembled at the office of the HSSC in Panchkula on Wednesday to participate in ‘Save Jobs, Save Haryana’ protest. He said that on formation of the Congress government, an FIR would be lodged within a week against the chairman/members and other accused in the racket, besides holding of a judicial inquiry into the matter.
 
 “This sinister game had begun with the appointment of Bharat Bhushan Bharti as the chairman of the HSSC. The last date for applying for the post of chairman was December 31, 2014, but Bharti’s application was considered 53 days later on February 23, 2015. Not only this, on March 11, an audio got viral on social media regarding demand of Rs 70 lakh by Bharti for appointment as chairman of   municipal council,” alleged Surjwala while intensifying attack on the HSSC chairman.
 
 Surjewala also accused Khattar of spending public money on his own publicity. He further said that the BJP government spent Rs 366 crore on publicity in the first three years, which meant that it spent Rs 53,000 per hour on publicity alone.
