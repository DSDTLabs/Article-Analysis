Chennai: A day after police arrested Manish Kumar, 22, for robbing a bank on Monday, sleuths from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) questioned him at the Adyar police station.

 They were investigating if there was a network behind him, sources said.
 
 On Monday afternoon, Manish, a native of Bihar, barged into an   branch and robbed Rs 6.35 lakh at gunpoint. Subsequently, he tried to escape from the place on a motorcycle. 
 
 His attempts were thwarted when a 26-year-old Mohanraj gave him a good chase and nabbed him near the Adyar canal with the help of traffic police personnel.
 
 Police seized four bullets and two country-made pistols from Manish.
 
 They also questioned his roommate Premkumar, who told the police that Manish Kumar had borrowed his bike and also showed him the two country-made pistols which he bought from Bihar.
 
  Manish Kumar, a Class IX dropout , had moved to Chennai six years ago but was not able to find a job. He told the police that he had hatched the robbery plan to become rich overnight.
