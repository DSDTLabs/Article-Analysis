TRICHY: With an objective to conserve marine wealth during their natural breeding season, the revised annual fishing ban of 61 days will come to effect from the wee hours of Sunday. 

  department urged the mechanised boat owners to follow the   and not venture into sea, even on trawlers, as it would attract penalty. Fishermen sources said that as the similar fishing ban in western coast would commence only by June 1, a large number them would temporarily migrate to western coasts for work. Prices of sea food are expected to skyrocket during the ban period. TNN
