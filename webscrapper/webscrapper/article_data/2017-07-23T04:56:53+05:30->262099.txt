MUMBAI: Potholes on the Valvan bridge section in Lonavla on the   left 28 vehicles with punctures between Friday night and Saturday afternoon. A few motorists said that wheel caps of their vehicles came off due to the bad 500m stretch on the Expressway. Police officials on night pat rol duty were also not spared as tyres of two vehicles of the Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) team were punctured. An HSP officer said, “We drove over the potholes while patrolling the highway at night and within minutes, one of the wheels was flat. Thankfully, we were not travelling at a high speed and the driver managed to stop the car a few metres away.“

 Superintendent of police, HSP , Pune, Amol Tambe, said he had deputed two constables to request motorists to slow down while approaching the potholed stretch. According to Expressway officials, the potho les led to a minor traffic jam as several motorists stopped to replace their flat tyres.
 
 A senior officer of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which is responsible for the Expressway's maintenance, said the potholes had developed over the past five days. Though officials from the maintenance team have been instructed to repair the potholes, heavy rain had been hampering work, he added.
 
 “We have not received any information about vehicles getting damaged. We will look into the issue,“ he said .
 
 “Apart from this stretch, the entire Expressway is in a good condition despite heavy rain,“ said an Expressway official.
