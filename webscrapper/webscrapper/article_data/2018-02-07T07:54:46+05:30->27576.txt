HYDERABAD: Telangana Padresh Congress Committee president N   Kumar Reddy charged chief minister   Rao-led TRS government with failing to fill up even 10% of the total vacancies in various government departments in the state.

 Uttam and   leader   flagged off the “Nirudyoga Chaitanya Yatra” (unemployed awareness yatra), by the Youth Congress, led by its president Anil Kumar Yadav. The bus yatra will cover all the 119 Assembly segments in the next 45 days and will “expose the empty promises of KCR” and “failures of TRS government in solving unemployment issue”. “The government has filled only 7,000-odd posts through the state Public Service Commission which is less than 10% of the total vacancies,” Uttam said.
 
 Expressing confidence that his party will come to power in coming elections, Uttam promised that the next regime would fill up all the vacancies and assured an unemployment allowance of ?3,000 per month.
