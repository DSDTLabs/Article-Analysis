AHMEDABAD: Jigar, 22, had never thought that he would have to spend the   in a  . Taking it easy, Jigar had   dressed in   on CG Road on Thursday night. The young girl, who was in a group of four, turned back grabbed Jigar by his collar and showed him her police identity card.

 It was not Jigar alone who was taken to the police station. Thirteen more such eve-teasers were nabbed by the anti-Romeo decoy squad of the city woman police from CG Road, SG Road and the riverfront.
 
 Assistant commissioner of police, (woman police), Panna Momaya, said they were preparing the decoy squad since about a week before the Navratri. “We had selected about 20 young women police constables recently recruited in the police force. “We gave them training on how to identify eve-teasers. They were then deployed at three different locations on the first garba night dressed in chaniya-cholis,” added Momaya.
 
 According to police sources, the squad nabbed five eve-teasers from the riverfront, six from SG Road and three from CG Road. “All of them were arrested and were bailed out later on,” added Momaya. Momaya added that the exercise of deploying decoy squads will be carried out through nine nights of Navratri at different city locations to nab eve-teasers.
