Director   seems to be a master at permutation and combination. Well, we have exclusive dope about the music composer of his next,   2, which will have   in the lead. He has roped in   for Saamy 2, replacing   Jayaraj, who was the composer for the first film. Interestingly, Hari had chosen Harris for Si3 after working with Devi Sri Prasad for the first two Singam films!

 Confirming the news, the producer of the film, Shibu Thameens, says, “When we approached DSP, he was thrilled and was happy to be part of the venture. He has given some back-to-back hits in Telugu and I’m sure he can match Hari’s racy shots in the movie. They have worked together previously and share a great camaraderie.” 
 
 The film will see Hari reuniting with Vikram for the first time since Saamy in 2003. Keerthy Suresh and Trisha will be playing the female leads.
