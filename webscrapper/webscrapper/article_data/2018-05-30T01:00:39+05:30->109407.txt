NEW DELHI: “It was the love and support of my teachers and parents that got me through,” said Shubhankar, a student of Amity International School, Sector 43 in Gurgaon, who scored 87.4% in his CBSE Class X examinations. Suffering from dyslexia,   said his school and tuition teachers played a vital role in his success. 

 Shubhankar put in his own share of hard work. He would wake up at 4am every days to study and work on Saturdays in school with his IT teacher. 
 
 “My parents were a constant source of encouragement. They helped me with most of my projects and submissions,” he told TOI. Arushi Arora of Amity in  , too, suffers from dyslexia, but no learning disability could stop her from scoring 94.6%. Along with her parents and teachers, she is also all praise for her writer. “My writer was a Class IX student from my school who stayed calm through the paper and understood my thoughts,” she said. 
 
 Sarthak Srivastava, from Amity in Vasundhara, despite fighting Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, scored 83.4%. Just one week before his exams, Sarthak had to have his chemotherapy treatment, which left him with acute body pain. 
 
 But instead of giving up, he would study till late at night and wake up on time the next morning. “A few days before my exam, I broke my arm and had to opt for a writer,” he said. But his perseverance, and “support from teachers and parents”, helped him emerge a winner. (Khushi Raizada & Siddhant Ahirwal)
