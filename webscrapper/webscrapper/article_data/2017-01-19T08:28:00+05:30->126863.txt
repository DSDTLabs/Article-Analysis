CHENNAI: Thousands of people took part in   protests in the city on Wednesday, bringing traffic to a halt in several localities and causing traffic snarls and diversions through the day.

 Motorists in the stretch of   along  , the epicentre of the protests, and Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), with several educational institutions and IT parks, took the worst hits. The chaos also affected streets off these roads and delayed vehicles of both common motorists and even chief minister  , who traversed via Anna Salai to the secretariat.
 
 Vehicles piled on the service lane off Marina Beach as the number of protesters increased through the day. Traffic policemen rerouted several protesters who attempted to park their vehicles on the lane. Several protesters had to park their vehicles a few kilometres from Marina Beach and march on foot to the venue of the stir.
 
 Disorderly motorists creating a pandemonium near the protest sites had a domino effect on vehicle users on roads nearby, with commuters reduced to a crawl on Anna Salai and Santhome High Road. And, as several groups of students moved toward Marina Beach, they left in their wake a spillover on several adjoining roads.
 
 There were waiting rows of vehicles on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), when students of Sathyabama University and employees of IT companies joined the protest. Social media was flooded with memes and selfies from pro-jallikattu supporters and scenes from the crowd on OMR.
 
 Some protesters volunteered to control traffic but found the task as hard as the policemen did.
