NAVI MUMBAI: Cidco will float   later this week for three   reserved for five star hotels as part of the much-awaited Navi Mumbai airport-led growth for the expanding city. Cidco looks at raking in at least Rs 200 crore from the land deal.

 Cidco MD Bhushan Gagrani has timed the tendering with the Centre's announcement of extending the first phase take-off of the Rs 16,000-crore Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) from December 2019 to 2020.
 
 Passenger growth for the NMIA has been pegged at 10 million after the first four years (so now it would be 2024). Then, every two years, it would go up to 25 million, 40 million and finally, during the second phase of the project, the count is pegged at 60 million for 2030, said senior Cidco PRO Mohan Ninawe. “It takes nearly three to four years for a five-star hotel to be constructed and commissioned. The airport's development and that of the new hotels would thus be simultaneous,“ said Vivek Marathe, Cidco consultant (marketing).
 
 Marathe told TOI on Tu esday , “We have stringent conditions for the applicants, so that the plots are not used for investment purposes.“ A major condition is that any applicant should have owned or operated at least two five-star hotels in India or globally for five years, said a source.
 
 The plots are majorly towards the south entry-exit of the planned airport and are close to one another. President of Navi Mumbai hotel owners association, Dayanand Shetty , said that at present there are just three fivestar hotels in the city.
 
 As for the bidding process, a bidder can be a single entity or a consortium in which the lead partner will have to meet requirements as stipulated for owning or operating hotels either in India or abroad. The net worth of the bidder should not be less than Rs 400 crore. The bidder must also have had a minimum average annual turnover of Rs 250 crore in the last three financial years.
