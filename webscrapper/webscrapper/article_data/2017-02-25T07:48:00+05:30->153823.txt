GURUGRAM: Police have identified the owner of the vehicle, which the accused used for their escape in the   case.

 The SUV is registered in the name of a Rajesh, resident of   village in   district, who is also a co-accused in the case. Like the victims, Rajesh was also involved in property business.
 
 “A licensed weapon was used in the double murder of the property dealers, but who used the weapon and who the owner of the weapon is, is not yet clear and is a matter of investigation,” a senior police officer told TOI. It was clear from yesterday that the sole reason behind the double murder was a property dispute. Today, police again questioned the injured   who is the only survivor, Sunil.
 
 During questioning Sunil repeated that along with the two other victims, Sandeep and Ramavtar, he had bought a plot in Farrukhnagar through accused property dealer Ved Saini, but later found out that Saini had duped them and had already sold the same plot to a Prashant Thakran.
 
 “Saini had called us in his office to talk about the pending Rs 36 lakh which he was directed to pay by the panchayat. After an argument, when we insisted for the money, Saini and his men started firing at us,” Sunil told police.
 
 On Friday, police teams conducted raids in Farrukhnagar, Jhajjar and Delhi.
 
 DCP (South) Ashok Bakshi said, “We got many important clues about the accused. The accused are absconding, along with their family members. We are trying to trace them. They will be arrested soon.”
 
 Two property dealers were killed and another suffered injuries after being shot by a business rival and his accomplices at the latter’s office in Farrukhnagar on Thursday afternoon. Sandeep died on the spot, while Ramavtar died in hospital. Sunil, who is now out of danger, was rushed to Civil Hospital in Rewari, and was later shifted to Medanta Hospital.
