LUCKNOW:   national president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday questioned the credibility of electronic voting machine (EVMs) during elections. He said if petrol dispensing machines can be tampered by using a remotely controlled chip,   are no exception. Recently, UP Police busted a racket and found chip inserted in petrol dispensing machines.

 “When petrol can be stolen with a remote controlled chip without any internet connection, EVMs too can be manipulated. Need to stop misuse of technology,” Akhilesh tweeted on Saturday. This was the first time Akhilesh had directly questioned the credibility of the voting machines since the issue was first raised by   supremo Mayawati soon after the assembly election results were announced in March.
 
 The   has maintained that EVMs were tamper proof as they were not linked to any online gateway and were independent units.
 
 Mayawati had also moved the Supreme Court on the issue, while Akhilesh initially only supported her stand asking the ECI to convince the people that the EVMs were tamper proof. Akhilesh’s remarks came days after the Special Task Force of UP Police busted a racket in which electronic chips were used to tamper the circuit of the petrol dispensing units at gas stations in a manner that the output of unit was less than what was reflected on the dispenser meter and the chip was remotely controlled.
