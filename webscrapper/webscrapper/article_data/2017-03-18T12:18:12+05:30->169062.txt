NAGPUR: “Nowadays we can see many words from other languages are being used while speaking Marathi, because of the influence of the   and nearby states but many of Marathi words are also being used in other languages. Marathi is an   and is compatible with other languages,” said  ,  , on Friday. She was speaking at a lecture organized by Sarvadhar Jyeshtha Nagrik Mandal (SJNM) on the topic ‘Mazi May Marathi: Vaibhav ani Vibhram’ at Samaj Bhavan, Pawanbhoomi Ground, Wardha Road.

 She said, “ Once while I was reading a book ‘Learn Telugu in seven days’, I found many Marathi words in it”. 
 
 Talking about the glory of Marathi language, Jumde said that Marathi language can never vanish from the world as it has ancient roots and it is language of emotions.
 
 “English language is necessary and must be taught but people say Marathi must be made compulsory which is not a right way to keep the language alive. Marathi is a spoken language and will be alive if we teach it to our children at home. In fact, Marathi is not just a language, it’s a culture,” she said.
 
 Enlightening the audiences about the history of Marathi, she said, “Marathi had evolved from nature. Initially the language used the voices of birds and animals to communicate, then came signs and ideograms but it mostly evolved through the writings of saints like Sant Dyaneshwar, Sant Tukaram and others.”
 
 Jumde further said, “There is no religious barrier for the lovers of Marathi language as from the ancient times many Muslim and Christian scholars had used Marathi for their literature work and even praised it as most user-friendly language.”
 
 “Eknath Maharaj was a great scholar who wrote his literary pieces in Marathi language, which has helped the language grow rapidly,” said Jumde.
 
 Parshuram Nawkarkar vice-president of SJNM and MM Mokadam were also present at the event.
