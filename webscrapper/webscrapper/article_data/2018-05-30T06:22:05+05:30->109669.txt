VADODARA: Inmates of   are set to break the shackles within the high walls and get a more meaningful life.

  in Gujarat, the welfare department of Vadodara Central Jail has started its own petrol pump near the   compound of jail for which it is training the prisoners to work as pump attendants. 
 
 The profits earned from the sales will be used for welfare schemes planned for the inmates. Presently, workers of a private contractor are working as attendants at the petrol pump, which was inaugurated in April this year. Initially five inmates will be trained to work as attendants, a jail official said. Working at the petrol pump will be a part of their jail work duties. “After the first batch of inmates, another batch will be trained so that they can replace others after some months,” said  , welfare officer of Vadodara Central Jail.
 
 Rathod added that besides making the inmates work as attendants, the petrol pump will work as a major source of rehabilitation of family members of inmates who died during their jail term since 1998. “There is a state government scheme where the family members of inmates can be provided employment as a part of their rehabilitation,” Rathod said.
 
 Jail officials are also planning to talk to other public sector oil marketing companies for inmates who have finished their jail terms. “Rehabilitating the inmates in society after their punishment has ended is also part of the welfare program. Our aim is that inmates get employment so that they start earning and do not turn to crime again,” Rathod told TOI.
 
 According to jail officials, the welfare fund which will increase thanks to profit of the petrol pump will be used for improving industries that operate in jail where inmates work. The fund will also ensure that the children of female inmates get better education.
