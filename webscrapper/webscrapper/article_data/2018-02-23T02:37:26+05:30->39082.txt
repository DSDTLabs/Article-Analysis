JAIPUR: A circular issued by the Sarva Siksha Abhiyaan’s Jaitran office in Pali district has brought much embarrassment to the   education department.

 
 The circular, dated February 20, directs panchayat elementary education officers (PEEOs) to ensure a booklet on the achievements of the   is distributed along with the marksheets of students in government schools. Faced with criticism, the state was forced to do a U-turn. After categorically denying that such an order had been issued, government officials on Thursday evening said that the “matter will be looked into”.
 
 Naresh Pal Gangwar, principal secretary of education department, denied passing any such order. “Department can never issue a directive saying distribute booklets to 65 lakh students in 69,000 government schools. I have asked the SSA director to look into the matter. There appears to be some confusion among officials at the district level, as the trend of distributing state communication exists but that is only among officials, and in some cases, teachers.” Earlier, education minister   also denied such a circular had been issued.
 
 TOI has a copy of the order that was issued to Jaitharan block PEEOs directing them to access the enrolment of students in government schools and distribute the booklet accordingly. The order mentions that directions are being issued at the behest of the primary education council, Jaipur.
