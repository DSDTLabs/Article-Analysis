TUTICORIN: Amid fanfare, actor   paid a quick visit to the victims of the police firing who are under treatment at the   and Hospital on Wednesday. The injured and their relatives were overjoyed to see the actor and shook hands with him as the mood on the fifth floor of the hospital, where they were admitted to, turned celebratory. 

 However, some of the relatives were also left disappointed as they were unable to meet him after being made to wait for four hours at a resort.
 
 An ardent Rajinikanth fan for 35 years, P Kamaraj, 45, from the fisherman colony on George Road, hugged the actor and refused to leave him till those near him clicked pictures of the pose. 
 
 But, disappointment was in store for the families which were brought to the resort to meet him. They could not make a representation or even meet him which eventually left them fuming. The families were made to wait in a hall where after hours they got an instruction that only one member of each family needed to wait while the rest could leave due to space constraints. Though they dutifully obeyed it, only later did they realise that the actor had left without meeting them.
 
  told reporters that he could not visit families of victims at their doorstep as the police had denied him permission.
