Vijayawada: Meagre inflows into River Krishna are a major cause for concern for both the Telugu states. Though incessant rain lashed the sibling states for the last few days, the catchment area did not receive adequate rainfall to fill the projects. As the Almatti dam in Karnataka is still half empty, the prospect of inflows into Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects in the near future are bleak.

 The Almatti dam has a total storage capacity of 129.72 tmcft and its present water level is 55.27 tmcft. There is an additional cushion of about 74.45 tmcft. Karnataka will release water only once the Almatti dam is full. As of now, Almatti is receiving 38,452 cusecs of inflows.
 
 After Almatti receives its full capacity, the water will flow to Narayanpur dam before it enters River Krishna in Andhra Pradesh. Narayanpur has a storage capacity of 37.69 tmcft and its present level is 14.69 tmcft so it can hold flood water inflows to a tune of 22.96 tmcft. As of now, Narayanpur is not receiving any inflows.
 
 Around this time last year, both Almatti and Narayanpur dams were almost full and the water was released downstream of the Jurala project. This time around, 50 days into the monsoon season, major projects except Almatti did not receive any inflows.
 
 Presently, Srisailam has 19.05 tmcft water with an additional capacity of holding 196.76 tmcft water. The Nagarjuna Sagar Project (NSP) has 117.85 tmcft water with an additional flood cushion of 194.20 tmcft water.
 
 This year, even farmers in the Krishna Delta have started agricultural operations with Pattiseema water. It will be crucial for them to get water from Nagarjuna Sagar. The western delta, however, is totally dependent on Nagarjuna Sagar as water from Prakasam barrage goes to Tenali region. The upland areas of Guntur district and Prakasam are dependent on water from NSP.
 
 However, minister for water resources Devineni Umamaheswara Rao said, “We have positive forecasts from the meteorological department and ISRO. Though Krishna projects are yet to receive inflows, we are waiting for the situation to improve in August.’’
