JAMSHEDPUR:   and its subsidiary, Jusco, on Wednesday gifted a   to the industrial town on the 178th   of founder  . The Science Park, or Exploratorium, has been designed and developed to help students learn the basic principles of science by working and playing on apparatus that demonstrate these principles. 

 Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement also helped Tata Steel and Jusco in setting up the park. 
 
 “Our aim is to evoke some curiosity among children. AT the park, they will have to find answers to certain queries as to how something happens by actually experiencing it. It makes the conceptual understanding of science more robust and fun than if it were to be learnt only through a textbook in a classroom,” said Tata Steel vice-president (corporate services) Sunil Bhaskaran.
 
 Addressing a press conference at JRD Tata Sports Complex, Jusco MD   said: “A lot of effort and struggle has gone into putting these models together.” 
 
 Tata Steel will also dedicate an integrated command and control centre — jointly developed by Tata Steel, Tata Communication, Jusco and Hyderabad-based startup Kernel Spher — for management of municipal and utility services.
 
 “It’s the first such data-based management system in the state. Integrated command and control system is a step towards making the town smarter,” Mathur said. 
 
 Mathur added that a dozen-odd initiatives — including digital waste bin, smart parking, vehicle tracking, security surveillance, transforming monitoring structures, leak detection in water distribution network, water quality test and workforce tracking — will be launched on Founder’s Day eve.
