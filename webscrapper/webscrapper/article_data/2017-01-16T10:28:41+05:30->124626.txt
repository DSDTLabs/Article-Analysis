Anna has lodged a complaint with Mattancherry police.
 
 “We could not trace his mobile tower location. As per the activity log of one of his email accounts, his location was shown as Mumbai, Madhya Pradesh and Nepal. A team of four police officers including Fort Kochi station house officer is camping in Goa to find of the duo,” said Mattanchery ACP Vijayan S adding that the man could have left the state in a car. 
 
 When court had considered the case on January 3, James did not appear and his lawyer produced a letter 2 days later, which stated that he has moved to Goa and would not disclose his location. On Friday,the team led sub-inspector Antony Joseph Netto arrived in Goa in search of James and the boy.
 
  Anna, who works with a public relations agency, had on Friday posted on Facebook seeking help to find her son and added he was not happy about leaving with his father.
 
 “ I told him the next morning that he had to go with his father, and Sam started crying. ‘How many days, Amma?’ he asked. I promised him that he would be back soon to celebrate the New Year’s with us. ‘How many days is that?’ he asked again between tears. Like I always do to soften the blow, I lessened the number of days and told him that he was going for five, rather than six. ‘Five days?’... ,” reads the post.
 
 The police have also issued a lookout notice for the duo.
