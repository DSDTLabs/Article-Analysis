NAGPUR: Hudkeshwar police have invoked the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, against the accused Ganesh   in the murder case of   kin.

 Accused Sahu was produced before the court on Monday which remanded him to police custody till Saturday. Sahu’s wife and his cousin brothers are being interrogated as their role is yet to be established in the heinous double murder.
 
  (54) and her one-and-half-year-old grand-daughter Rashi were brutally killed by the accused, who slit their throats with a tin plate of oil can on the first floor of his house located in the vicinity of Kamble’s place in   on Saturday around 6pm.
 
 Sahu had packed the bodies in gunny bags and had hidden it under a culvert near Vihirgaon. Usha had demanded Rs7,000 back from Sahu and abused him in front of his customers which triggered the murder.
 
 Though the motive behind the murders was clear and the accused, a grocery shop owner, has confessed to his crime, a section of cops suspect that the accused’s wife   was an accomplice in the act as she was present in the house when the murders took place.
 
 Guddiya, along with the two Sahu brothers, Akshay and Ankit, and another cousin   are undergoing sustained questioning. Cops suspect that killing two persons and packing the bodies in gunny bags could not be the act of only the main accused.
