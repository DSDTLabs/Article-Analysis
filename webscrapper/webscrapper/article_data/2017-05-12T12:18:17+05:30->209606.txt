NEW DELHI:  's dramatic turnaround after their poor show in the earlier part of   10 has everything to do with the team's relaxed mindset and contribution from the youngsters, captain   said here during a talk show.

 The team had only one win out of their first four games but have performed consistently after that to bolster their chances of making the play-offs.
 
 "I stayed relaxed throughout the first phase of the tournament. I have enjoyed a lot. Now, we are on a winning run and have the chance to finish in the top-two. The best thing is that we are not dependent on one or two guys. Majority of our players have performed. The youngsters in our team have contributed in a big way. Tripathi (Rahul) has done very well with the bat,   (Unadkat) has bowled some very good spells," Smith said.
 
 When asked about the pressure of captaining, he said, "I am still working on it. Being a captain is a difficult task. All the cameras are on you and you are being noticed. It's not easy to perform with all the pressure."
 
 The Aussie cricketer also praised the Indian batsmen for the way they have learnt the art of playing on faster wickets. "Indian players have changed over the years. They have young batters who face fast bowling really well. They have quality pacers as well," he added.
 
 Smith also spoke on how the IPL is a good stage to prepare for the Champions Trophy next month in England. "Good to play white ball cricket ahead of the Champions Trophy."
