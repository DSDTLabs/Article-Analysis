PATNA: Chief minister   on Thursday flagged off 25 non-AC buses, which will ply between Bankipore bus depot and Danapur via Jawaharlal Nehru Marg (Bailey Road). The buses will be available at all the 20 stoppages at an interval of 10 minutes.

 The CM also inaugurated the state’s first driving school – Institute of Driving and Traffic Research – at a function held at   here. The institute has been established on a 15-acre land in Aurangabad with an investment of Rs 25 crore. The government will run the institute on a public-private partnership ( ) mode with Maruti Suzuki. Over 70 students were enrolled on the very first day of the opening of the institute on Thursday.
 
 Kumar said foot over bridges and underpasses should be constructed in the city on a priority basis. He warned people, especially youths, against using cellphones while driving. 
 
 Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said vehicular emission was mainly responsible for air pollution in the city. “The state government will set up CNG filling stations at five places in the city to reduce pollution. Henceforth, all diesel and petrol pumping stations will issue pollution certificates,” he added.
 
 Modi challenged WHO’s global air pollution data that ranked Patna fifth and Gaya fourth most polluted city in the world in terms of PM 2.5 concentration.
 
 Modi said the driving institute in Aurangabad would generate employment for hundreds of youths in the state. “The state government is in the process of setting up similar institutes in every district. A trained driver can earn anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000 per month in Patna and Rs 50,000 in Delhi,” Modi said.
 
 Meanwhile, the CM also laid foundation stones for 15 district transport offices on Thursday. The offices will be constructed with an estimated expenditure of Rs 40 crore. The project to give a facelift to the office of the transport department in the Secretariat was also inaugurated.
