Canacona: A non-cognizable offence was registered against Canacona MLA and sports minister Ramesh Tawadkar, on Tuesday, following a complaint by Puno Velip, a resident of Cotigao, alleging that Tawadkar threatened to kill him. Velip is a supporter of former Canacona MLA, Vijay Pai Khot.  In his complaint, Velip said that while he was riding to Canacona with Manohar Naik Desai, another Cotigao resident, at around 9am on Tuesday, Tawadkar, who was travelling in the opposite direction, intercepted him at Manem, scolded him and even threatened to kill him. The sports minister also allegedly warned that he would restrict education to Velip’s children, who study at Shree Balaram Residential School owned by him.  When contacted, Tawadkar denied having threatened Velip and claimed that he merely asked why he had spoken against him during a get-together held at Khot’s residence last week. He also alleged that the incident was one of Khot’s stunts to malign his image ahead of the assembly election. “I have never abused anyone, leave alone threatening someone’s life,” he said. Canacona police registered a non-cognizable offence against Tawadkar under Sections 341, 506 and 34 IPC. PI Filomeno Costa is investigating the case further.  Meanwhile, Khot, along with over 100 individuals, approached the Canacona police station and demanded strict action against Tawadkar. Speaking to reporters, he said such acts against his supporters would not be tolerated.
