BENGALURU: With a conciliatory meeting between BMRCL management and a section of staff on Wednesday failing to reach a consensus, employees have decided to stick to their   call on Monday ( June 4).

 
 Suryanarayana Murthy, vice president,   Employees Union (BMREU), said: “The management has rejected all our demands. Since the high court hearing is scheduled for the morning, we will go on strike from Monday evening. We will take a final call based on the HC order.”
 
 Metro authorities said the services won’t be affected as they have a back-up plan in place.
