BENGALURU: At least   were recorded in Karnataka last year, the second highest in the country after Madhya Pradesh (30), according to data of the  .

 But 2017 may just be the worst year for the big cats as five tiger deaths have already been reported in the state in less than 23 days.
 
 According to the 2015 census, Karnataka has over 406 tigers in the wild — 221 of them in Bandipur and Nagarahole national parks.
 
 The major worry for the forest officials is that the main abode of tigers, Nagarahole National Park and  , is increasingly becoming unsafe for the endangered species, leaving animal lovers and wildlife activists worried. The two national parks also lost the most number of tigers in 2016. While Nagarahole saw 12 tiger deaths, Bandipur lost five of them.
 
 Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) B J Hosmath said that territorial fights could be behind two tiger deaths and poisoning could be the cause for another. In two other cases, the cause of death has not been established.
 
 Of the four tiger deaths, wildlife experts said two are a cause for deep concern and demands an in-depth probe.
 
 Praveen Bhargav, trustee, Wildlife First, said, “A young male tiger aged 9-10 years first got injured after its foreleg was caught in a snare at Bekkesodlur on the western edge of Nagarahole, eventually resulting in its capture and death. This could be because of rampant snaring around the Lakshmanathirtha, a tributary of the Cauvery near Nittur in Kodagu.”
 
 Forest officials, who spotted the carcass, however, had claimed that the tiger may have succumbed to death after it was wounded while eating a porcupine.
 
 Bhargav said the death of a healthy tigress in the Antharasanthe Range raises several questions on the growing trend of excessive interventional management without leadership and proper technical advice. “The competence of the ranger and some junior staff wielding tranquilizer guns chasing the tigress and reportedly darting it several times in the night is worrisome, largely because it was done without orders from the chief wildlife warden, as mandated by law. It also exposes the failure of the   (NTCA), which is sticking to an incompetent outside expert to oversee all post mortems even after repeated cover-ups,” he said.
 
 Hosmath, too, admitted that it was a mistake and was being looked into earnestly.
 
 Wildlife expert M C Cariappa said the man-animal conflict has escalated with 117 villages surrounding Nagarahole and about 150 villages around Bandipur where old or injured tigers enter into to stalk cattle. “This is leading to territorial fights and poisoning. There is need for augmenting the buffer zone and extending it protection so that surplus population of predators is absorbed in these habitats,” he said.

 Wildlife, in general, is a low-priority sector for the state government that has always resisted pro-wildlife measures such as notification of buffer areas around tiger reserves to keep their vote bank intact. More vigilance on the part of forest officials is needed.
