ALLAHABAD: Parents of a four and a half years old Ghana girl,  , who is currently undergoing treatment for quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy in the city, have sought extension of visa from minister for external affairs   for treatment of their daughter.

 The girl's father,  , has tweeted on Swaraj's Twitter account seeking her help. The minister in her reply has inquired about the expiry date of their visa and the duration of extension that is needed.
 
 “We have requested the minister on her Twitter account to help us get our visa extended on humanitarian ground so that our daughter could get a new lease of life,“ Richmond told TOI on Saturday. “It's encouraging for us that the minister has replied and inquired about the details like when is the medical visa expiring and how much time our daughter needs for treatment,“ he added.
 
 Richmond also mentioned that their visas are expiring on February 2 and they need extension till the end of June so that full treatment could be provided to the girl.
 
 The family had arrived in New Delhi on January 4 and approached doctors in Allahabad for the girl's treatment. Dr  , who is treating the girl, told TOI: “She is suffering from quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy and is not able to sit, crawl, walk or speak since birth.“
 
 The doctor added that the girl is severely disabled and needs surgery and intensive therapy for at least five months. Unfortunately, the family could obtain visa for a month only and had tweeted to the minister to have the expiry date of the documents extended by six months.
