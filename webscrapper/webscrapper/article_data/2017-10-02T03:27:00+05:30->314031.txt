Mapusa: Mapusa muncipal council (MMC) has sought the assistance of the town police as it prepares to engage in demolition drives of illegal encroachments in the Mapusa municipal market.  The recent ordinary council meeting witnessed heated arguments over the encroachments by vendors in the municipal market. The councillors demanded that the chairperson take the assistance of the Mapusa police to decongest the market.  Chairperson Rohan Kavlekar told the council about the decisions taken by the market committee, such as installation of CCTV cameras at prime locations like the fish market, vegetable market, fruit market and various entrances; prohibition of lamanis selling jewellery in the market and shifting of flower vendors into the market. These and other decisions were approved by the council in the recent meeting. Councillor Tushar Tople said “The market committee and municipal inspector have failed to curtail the mess created due to the encroachments in the market. Spaces meant for vehicular parking have been encroached upon by daily vendors. Moreover, no remedial steps are being taken.”  Market committee chairman Sanjay Mishal said the committee faces difficulties in clearing the encroachments because of the lack of muncipal inspectors and other staff - an issue that Kavlekar has assured that he will fix, soon.
