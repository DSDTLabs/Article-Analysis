NEW DELHI:   stepped up its attack on PM   on Saturday after he announced a host of sops to soften the hardship of demonetisation, terming his televised address to the nation “disappointing”.

 The main opposition party also slammed the address, saying it is for the first time a Budget speech was made outside the Parliament. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said demonetisation has paralysed the economy but the PM in his address did not answer many crucial questions. “Mr Prime Minister, people wanted to know how many lakhs of crores of black money did you wipe out in the last 50 days? Why didn’t you speak about it,” he asked. “Disappointed with PM’s speech.
 
 Many questions were left unanswered. His decision paralysed nation’s economy and country can’t be run like this,” he added. The opposition party reiterated the demand for lifting restrictions imposed on withdrawals from banks. Surjewala said, “No deadline, only headline. Yeh PM ka chaal, chehra aur charitra ban gaya hai.”
 
 In a series of tweets, party spokesman Manish Tewari said, “This is a total bypass of the supreme legislature body. What is   going to do on 1st February or whenever he presents the Budget? It is already done. Is this not contempt of Parliament?” Tewari tweeted, “When Model Code of Conduct does not apply to  , why is PM hell-bent on undermining FM? Is there a larger message — Parliament be damned.”
