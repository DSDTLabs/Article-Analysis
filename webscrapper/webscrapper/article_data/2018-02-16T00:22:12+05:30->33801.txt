Tirupur: Nine peahens were found dead near a private farm in Pappampalayam near Uthukuli here on Thursday. Forest department officials and revenue department officials inspected the spot and the carcasses were sent to the Uthukuli Government Veterinary Clinic for postmortem. Viscera samples were sent to a forensic lab. “Since a flock of birds were found dead at a time, the forest authorities suspected that it could be due to poisoning. But, it could be confirmed only after getting the result from the forensic lab,” said a revenue official.
