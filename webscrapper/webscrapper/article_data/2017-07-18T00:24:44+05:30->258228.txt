MUMBAI: The Bombay high court order staying a 2015 National Green Tribunal (NGT) order for the   of the   river has been stayed by the  .

 NGO Vanashakti that had appealed to the NGT for restoration of the Ulhas river had filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court challenging the high court order.
 
 In its July 5 order, the Supreme Court has granted three weeks to the Dombivli Better Environment System Association and others to approach the NGT to modify its order or to approach the SC. The SC order clears the way for the setting up of the escrow account. 
 
 In October 2015, the high court had stayed the NGT order directing the four urban local bodies and the two common effluent treatment plants in two industrial areas, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the   (MIDC) to cumulatively deposit Rs 95 crore in an escrow account for the restitution and restoration of the Ulhas and   rivers.
 
 The National Institute of Oceanographyâ€™s field report on the Ulhas estuary said the upper and middle zones have been degraded due to release of domestic and industrial effluents and conditions are not conducive for diverse aquatic fauna. The Waldhuni river, it said, is so highly polluted that the damage may be irreversible.
 
 The NGT, in July 2015, had directed MPCB to initiate legal action against the urban local bodies for causing water pollution.
