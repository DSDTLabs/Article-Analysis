VISAKHAPATNAM: Suspecting them to be sympathisers of CPI Maoists, Vizag Rural cops and special forces allegedly picked up 60 villagers in Koyyuru and GK Veedhi mandals in the Visakha agency on Thursday. 

 Sources said more than 200 cops stormed 10 villages in the two mandals. 30 of the villagers picked up belong to Pedapadu, Busulu and Pamurai areas in the GK Veedhi mandal which are heavily under the Maoist influence. 
 
 The raids started in the early hours of Thursday. Sources said two persons from GK Veedhi mandal —   (32) and Pangi Naresh (25) — were arrested on February 2 at   area in Odisha by joint forces when they were allegedly purchasing foodgrains for Maoists. 
 
 Cops did not reveal details of the arrest but brought the two to Vizag for interrogation. With their information, cops conducted the operation in Koyyuru and GK Veedhi on Thursday and forcibly arrested tribals.
 
 “This act of cops reminded us of the Chintapalli arson in the early ’90s in which the police raided villages and torched houses indiscriminately. They brutally dragged the men from their houses after surrounding the villages with heavy forces. Men carry food material for Maoists because if they refuse they will face the brunt of the Reds. We are between the devil and the deep sea,” an old man from GK Veedhi mandal told TOI. 
 
 He said while cops brand these men as Maoist militia member or sympathisers, Maoists brand them as police informers. 
 
 Visakha Rural SP Rahuldev Sharma told TOI that they have not arrested anybody, but some of the villagers were brought for counselling and would be released soon.
