GHAZIABAD: The   ( ) has imposed a collective fine of Rs 1 lakh on three Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) officials, including the commissioner, for non-compliance with its earlier order on maintenance of a stretch of road in Sector 3, Vasundhara.

 In its order, the court said that apart from non-compliance, municipal commissioner Abdul Samad was guilty of failing to appear before the court despite a clear-cut direction by the NGT on February 17 to appear before the court on March 1. Apart from Samad, the two GMC officials who have been penalised are executive engineer R K Mittal and executive engineer Sanjay Chauhan. The case dates back to May last year when a Vasundhara resident, Nain Agarwal, filed a petition at the NGT saying that a stretch of road in Sector 3 has not been repaired for years and, as a result, has become a major source of dust pollution. In subsequent hearings, the court had ordered the GMC to repair the road and file a status report. “The repair work of the road which was carried out by the GMC was not satisfactory and the status report which was filed in the court was ‘misleading’, forcing the NGT to summon the municipal commissioner,” petitioner Agarwal said. “Municipal commissioner Abdul Samad did not appear in the court on March 1, forcing the NGT to impose a collective fine of Rs 1 lakh on him, R K Mittal and  ,” Agarwal said.
 
 The order further said, “… the recovery of the cost from them shall be in equal proportion from their salaries and they will also tender an unconditional apology. May this order be complied with within four weeks from March 1.”
