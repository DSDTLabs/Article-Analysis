GURUGRAM: The city’s air pollution level crossed the ‘very poor’ mark on Sunday morning, with the highest recorded PM2.5 level at 208 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3).

 Sunlight and corresponding fall in moisture in the lower atmosphere though brought pollution down to 171µg/m3 by evening, even though it still remained within the ‘very poor’ category. “Concentration of particulate matter generally goes up in the morning due to fog, which occurs due to a fall in temperature. However, by evening, better sunlight helped bring down moisture in the atmosphere, reducing PM concentration,” said an official of   ( ). 
 
 The highest level of PM2.5 recorded on Saturday was 143µg/m3 (‘poor’) and 136µg/m3 on Friday. Sunday’s air quality index (AQI) was unavailable. Gurgaon’s minimum and maximum temperatures on Sunday were 6°C and 19°C respectively.
 
 Met department officials blamed poor air quality to dip in temperature, but said the situation should improve next week. “North India continues to reel under a cold wave due to snowfall in the mountains, but the maximum temperature is expected to go up slightly in the Delhi-NCR region on Monday and Tuesday. Dense fog will continue to engulf the region during mornings, though,” said the official.
 
 HSPCB officials implemented the graded response action plan (GRAP) for ‘very poor’ conditions. “We’ve implemented all GRAP measures corresponding to the ‘very poor’ level, and instructed civic agencies and departments to take necessary action. Thankfully, we’re expecting temperatures to rise in the next 2-3 days, and pollution to correspondingly fall to at least ‘poor’,” said the official.
