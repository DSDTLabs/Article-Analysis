NAVI MUMBAI: After the recent sinking of a flotel anchored near the   link, a   based activist, Rohit Malhotra, has written to the NMMC commissioner on Tuesday alleging that the   activity at the Mini Seashore holding pond in Vashi needs to be monitored and proper safety measures be put in place to minimise risk to visitors. 

  Malhotra has alleged that safety measures, as laid down by agencies such as Maharashtra   Board or the National Institute of Water Sports, are not being adhered to at the Vashi holding pond stretch. 
 
 
  
 “Boating in the holding pond has been always a cause of concern. But after the sinking of the floating hotel, I drew the corporation’s attention to the issue with urgency,” said Malhotra. 
 
 Of the 15 hectare area of the holding pond, NMMC has leased a portion for five years in 2012 to a boating company. 
  
 The alleged charges of violations against the boating agency raised by Malhotra include not providing life jackets to passengers, not having medical assistance during emergency, not having adequate life guards among others. 
 
 The NMMC chief, Ramaswami N as well as the estate manager D Chabuskwar assured to take up the matter with utmost priority as it involves public safety. 
 
 However, Sachin Kadam, who is the director of the boating company,   said the allegations are baseless.
 
 “We have life guards and motor boats certified by the   (YAI), life boats certified by the Maritime board. Boating operation is only within 10 hecatres off the pond and there are life floats stationed within the pond as well,” said Kadam.
