Within hours of the announcement that AIADMK general secretary   was elected as the party's legislature head and would be the next chief minister, social media erupted with tweets, Facebook posts and memes.

 #Sasikala was trending at the all-India and Tamil Nadu level on Twitter.   was also trending for a while on the social media platform. #RIPTN was trending in Chennai.
 
 The main bone of contention for those tweeting with the latter hashtag was that   has not contested and won a single election till date. Memes and social media posts also targeted O Paneerselvam, who resigned as chief minister on Sunday . For instance one tweet by @r_satishkumar, which got more than 100 retweets, likened OPS to a guy sitting on the ladies seat of an MTC bus, who had to get up whenever a woman came towards the seat.
 
 The twitter handle @AdmkFails, which was at the forefront of taking on the party in the run-up to the 2016 assembly polls, actively put out tweets on Sunday evening.
 
 Support for Sasikala was hard to come by on social media platforms, but a few, like a top television journalist, pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi too first became chief minister of Gujarat without winning an election. Another user stated that Tamil Nadu getting another woman chief minister was a positive trend.
