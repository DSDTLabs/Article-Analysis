THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Labour minister T P   said the indefinite strike called by nurses working at the private hospitals from Tuesday was totally unnecessary. With the government toughening its stand and   re-asserting its demand, arriving at a solution before Tuesday has become less probable. 

 The minister said the government was in the final phase of determining the minimum wages and the nurses' associations were aware of this. "Hence the strike cannot be justified under any circumstance and the government will not support it. 
 
 Moreover, the issue related to KVM Hospital,   was different and now the nurses were going for a statewide agitation on this. It should have been have sorted out at the hospital itself, without making it a state-level concern, he added.
 
  "It was on July 20, 2017 that the state government had convened a meeting of private hospital managements, chaired by the chief minister himself. In this meeting it was decided to implement Rs 20,000 as minimum wage for nurses. But the minister is still not aware that many of the managements are not willing to agree to the condition of the government,'' said  , state vice-president of the association.
 
 The government has been providing all support to private hospital managements and that was the reason why the government has not yet acted tough against the latter, which were not willing to ensure the minimum wages, it was alleged.
 
 "The labour minister and food and supplies minister, who is also Cherthala MLA, had attended the meeting to settle the strike of the nurses at KVM Hospital. The agitation is nearing 200 days now. But when the management made it clear that they are not ready to take back the nurses who took part in the strike, both the ministers and the labour commission remained mute spectators. In fact, the ministers had given a silent support to the management of KVM Hospital,'' said Mukesh.
