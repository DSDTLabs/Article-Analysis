Mumbai: Rumours about a government move to introduce long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on stock investments, mainly to compensate for the loss in   collections, spooked Dalal Street investors in the last hour of trade on Monday. This led to a sharp dip in stock prices in the first session of 2018. As a result, the sensex — after remaining range-bound for most of the session due to low institutional participation during the New Year holidays — lost over 200 points within an hour and closed 244 points lower at 33,813.

 Since December 24, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first said in a speech that those who are making profit from the stock market were not paying enough tax, talks have been surfacing at regular intervals about the Modi government’s move to actually impose  . Of late, even   chief Ashishkumar Chauhan had been professing a tax on LTCG.

 Of the 30 sensex stocks, 25 closed in the red. Data at the end of the session on the BSE showed that, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 1,300 crore, foreign funds were net buyers at Rs 326 crore.
 
 Outside of the blue-chips, the stocks of Anil Ambani-controlled   were again in focus in Monday’s session, with Reliance Naval closing 32% up and Reliance Power 21%. Reliance Communications, after more than doubling in the previous four sessions, closed 2.3% lower. Since December 23, the day RCom announced it will repay a large chunk of its debt, the group’s stocks have been in the limelight.
 
 In the bond market, the benchmark yield on 10-year gilts closed at 7.34%, nearly unchanged from Friday.
