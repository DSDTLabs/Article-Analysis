NEW DELHI: With uncertainty over whether the Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) 
  will retain 
  in the upcoming Punjab elections, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief   today again needled SAD, accusing it and the opposition Congress of being in cahoots to ensure no personage from either party loses their seat.

 The AAP founder and Delhi chief minister’s comments came after Badal’s son Sukhbir tweeted yesterday urging the Congress party’s 
  to take on his father in Lambi. 
  . But there has been talk he will take on the SAD chief minister Parkash in Lambi, and will also stand from Patiala, to ensure he doesn’t lose a legislative seat.
  
 
 “Amarinder is welcome to fight election from Lambi, but then he should not file nomination from Patiala. He should end the dramas now!”, tweeted Sukhbir yesterday.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 To which Kejriwal replied: “Sukhbir ji, you’re the one who asked Amarinder to contest from Lambi, so it can help out your father (Parkash)”.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 AAP yesterday accused the Congress of helping the Punjab chief minister and his son Sukhbir escape "humiliating defeat" in Lambi and Jalalabad, respectively, by dividing anti-incumbency votes.
 
 "Choosing two seats reflects insecurity and uncertainty in the mind of Amarinder. However, AAP will ensure that Amarinder faces the same fate (as) that of (the) Badals. Amarinder can't change the destiny of Badal who has looted people of Punjab for 10 years and now finding shelter behind Congress party ," Mann said. 
 
 The party’s campaign committee chairman Bhagwant Mann alleged that both SAD and the Congress were aware that AAP was going to “sweep in Punjab” and that the Badals and Amarinder would lose their seats with “huge margins”. Mann alleged that Badal and Amarinder were two sides of the same coin and that their families always look after each other's political interests.
