MAPUSA: As one of the measures to address the water shortage problem,   panchayat on Sunday decided to take up cleaning of all unused   in the village. The panchayat will also undertake a survey of all public drains within the panchayat jurisdiction and initiate action against those discharging untreated water. 

 The ordinary gram sabha meeting held at Nachinola panchayat on Sunday was presided over by sarpanch   in the presence of deputy sarpanch   and other panch members.
 
 During the meeting, panchayat secretary   told the gram sabha members that the high court has directed the panchayat to take steps of curbing construction debris being dumped in open places or along public roads. He appealed to the villagers to not dump debris, and instead contact PWD (highway) in such situations. He also warned villagers that the panchayat will impose fines on anyone found dumping garbage by the roadside. tnn
