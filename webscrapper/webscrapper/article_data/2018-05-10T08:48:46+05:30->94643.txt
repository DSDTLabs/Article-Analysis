PUNE: The state government gave administrative and financial approval of Rs 3,513 crore for land acquisition for the proposed   on Wednesday.

 
  
 
 A GR issued by the general administrative department (GAD) said the state has approved the amount for acquiring about 2,376 hectares in Purandar. Of the amount, Rs 2,713 crore has been earmarked for land acquisition. The remaining is for other acquisitions. The GR said the amount would be given to Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC), which would be the Special Planning Authority (SPA) for the project.
 
 Naval Kishore Ram, the Pune collector, said the next step would be the MADC’s proposal for land acquisition. “Once the MADC is appointed as the SPA, it can make a proposal for land acquisition. A separate GR, with survey numbers and the rehabilitation process, has to be issued,” he said.
 
 Suresh Kakani, CMD of MADC, said it will be appointed as the SPA within 15-20 days. Officials at the MADC added the Centre too will allocate funds for the new airport, though a formal nod is awaited. “The funds from the Centre will either be used for the project development or for land acquisition. A formal communication is awaited,” a senior official said. He added, “The project is of national interest. One must not be surprised if the Centre decides to pump in funds.”
 
 In reply to a text message about whether the Centre has allocated the funds, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said: “Not yet.”
