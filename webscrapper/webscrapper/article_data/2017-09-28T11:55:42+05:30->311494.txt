KANNUR:   State secretary   has alleged that the party cadres are facing human rights violation in Lakshadweep, and the party State committee will send a delegation there.

 The party cadres in the islands, which is a Union Territory, have been facing police repression ever since the appointment of Farooq Khan, a BJP leader from Jammu and Kashmir, as the Administrator, and the police are even fabricating cases against the CPM workers and denying them their freedom for political activities, he said addressing a press conference here on Wednesday.
 
 Though normally IAS officers are appointed as administrators, here the appointment was political and now there is an undeclared ban against the CPM in the islands, where the population is 100 percent Muslim community that live in harmony, he alleged.
 
 Recently there was an issue related to the death of a patient apparently due to the alleged denial of the helicopter of the administration to take him to a hospital in Kochi, following which there was protest and ever since that the CPM has been targeted, he said.
 
 Observing that this is the latest example of the misuse of powers to help the BJP, he said there is an effort on the part of the BJP leadership in the Centre to capture the Lok Sabha constituency in the islands in the next election.
 
 Playing down the agitation by the CPM workers at Keezhattur, near Thaliparamba over the proposed NH bypass,   said it is a misleading campaign that the bypass will result in the loss of the entire stretch of paddy fields there.
 
 He also said the visit of BJP State president   to the venue of agitation on Wednesday was for political gain. The alignment was decided by the NHAI and it was the duty of the government to hand over the land they identified, he added.
