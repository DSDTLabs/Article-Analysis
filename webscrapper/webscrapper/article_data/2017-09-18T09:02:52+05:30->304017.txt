 "My mother was called by (a man identified as)   in Riyadh who had sent a domestic servant's visa. She was taken to Riyadh with an assurance of ample salary. She was told to just take care of a kafil's family.
 
 Later, she called me up and in formed that she was paid half of the salary. Since then, she was upset and wanted to return to India. But suddenly we lost contact and now we don't know where she is. It was early December in 2016 when we received her last call,'' she added.
 
 Yasmeen's mother   said that last year her daughter had called them up and informed that she will be in India very soon. They neither received her call nor got any information about her there after.
 
 "I am very concern about my daughter as she was about to return to India. But she is yet to s come back home. We approached many people seeking help e to bring her back, though nothing has happened. At least, we want to know where and how she is?,'' Yasmeen Begum's mother Shaheeda Begum said.
 
 Family members have appealed to   state government and external affair mininstry to intervene in the matter.
