LUCKNOW: Flexing her muscles before the formation of an “anti-BJP front”,   supremo   said on Saturday her party would enter into an alliance with other parties only if it was given a respectable number of seats. Else, she said, the BSP would contest the 2019 general elections alone.

 
 Addressing the party’s national executive meeting, Mayawati said though talks on alliance with parties in UP and other states were on, workers should be ready for any situation. “The talks for a coalition are on, but the cadres should be prepared to keep the party flag high in all situations,” she said. Referring to the alliance with one-time arch rival  , she said, “The time has come to oust the BJP in national interest.”
 
 Giving strong indications that she was in no mood to let go of the party’s control, the former CM said, “When the party president is not able to travel ahead in life due to age, he/she will don the role of national convener who will appoint the national president.”
 
 Observing that some “selfish and opportunist leaders” were trying to promote their family members in the BSP, she said, “My younger brother Anand Kumar, who held the position of vice-president, offered to step down in the interest of the Dalit movement and to serve as an ordinary worker.”
 
 
 
 Mayawati also effected an organisational rejig by appointing RS Kushwaha as the new UP unit president, replacing Ram Achal Rajbhar who was elevated as national general secretary. Kushwaha, who has been with the BSP since 2002, had contested against UPA chief Sonia Gandhi from  . Advocate Veer Singh and   MP Jai Prakash were appointed as national coordinators. BSP leader in UP Vidhan Sabha,   was delegated the additional responsibility of Chhattisgarh which goes to polls in a few months.
