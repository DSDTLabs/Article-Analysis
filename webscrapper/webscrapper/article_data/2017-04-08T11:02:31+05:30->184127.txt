 Protestors alleged that the cement plant has built up a boundary wall on about 100 acres of land allotted by   (AKVN) without obtaining the environmental clearance. 
 
 Another resident Dr   said, “The government has suppressed important information in the pre-feasibility report. There is an artificial pond, school and fields in the vicinity and cement plant will destroy everything.”
