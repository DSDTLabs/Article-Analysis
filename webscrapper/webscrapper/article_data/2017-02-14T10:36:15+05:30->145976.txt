RANCHI: This year, not just youngsters but the old, middle-aged or even   are keen to   as more and more older people are visiting   or the florists in the city. 

 The 55-year-old Vimal Lacchiramka said, "Even though I celebrate love every day, I make special efforts on Valentine's Day because it is a beautiful concept and another chance to make my better half feel special. " 
 
 Neeraj Kumar, owner of a gift shop, said, "One of our oldest customers purchased fifty cards from us in December last. He told me he has been married for fifty years and intends to give his wife a new card every day for fifty days till Valentine's day."
 
 Couples are breaking all stereotypes and prejudices to express their feelings to their loved ones. 
 
 Parents and children are also buying gifts to communicate their love for one another. Soon-to-be-married Abhinav and Jaya are among those who believe that love does not exist between couples only; it is even possible between just two people. They said, "Our parents played a huge role in bringing us together, so we are celebrating our love and marriage with them on Valentine's day. Without their love and support, our love would have been meaningless."
