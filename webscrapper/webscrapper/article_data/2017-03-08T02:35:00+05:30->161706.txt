NEW DELHI: Putting all uncertainties to rest over the registration of BS-III vehicles after April 1, the road   has said only manufacturing of such vehicles are not allowed after March end. The inventory of old (manufactured) vehicles, however, "needs to be protected and registered". 

 The ministry has framed its stand on the issues raised by the   appointed body,  , which wants to put a stop to registration of vehicles which don't comply with BS-IV emission norms from March 31, linking pollution under control certificates with the annual vehicular insurance to curb air pollution. 
 
 The   has shared its stand with heavy industries ministry and has asked it to submit its stand in the Supreme Court. Citing past examples, the transport ministry has said the same norm of allowing vehicles to be registered was followed when migration to BS-II and BS-III happened in 2001 and 2005. EPCA has reached out to state governments requesting them not to register any BS-III vehicle, which has caused huge concern to some of the heavy vehicle manufacturers since they have some quantity of inventory. 
 
 " The official clarification by road transport ministry through its March 3 memorandum will somewhat help truck makers to push last minute pre-buying of BS-III inventory. This will give commercial vehicle manufacturers some relief, who have built big inventories in expectation that vehicle owners would like to save price difference of around Rs 2.25 to Rs 2.5 lakh between BS-III and BS-II," said S P Singh of IFTRT, a Delhi-based think tank on transport issues.
