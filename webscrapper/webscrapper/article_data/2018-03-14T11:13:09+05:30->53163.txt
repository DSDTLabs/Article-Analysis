NAGPUR: One of the absconding poachers in the Pench tiger killing case, Bhimrao  , was nabbed on Tuesday. Parteti, a resident of Kolitmara, is one of the 16 accused on the run after Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court rejected their anticipatory bail. 

 The accused was dramatically arrested from Salai village on Madhya Pradesh-Maharashtra border. He was taking a nap when arrested.
 
 This is the first re-arrest by Paoni range forest officer (RFO) Pandurang Pakhle after 7 months since 16 tiger poachers have gone underground. The court has issued non-bailable warrant against all the 16 accused.
 
 As reported earlier, Parteti was arrested from Bondkhi after four tiger canines were found in his possession. He will be produced before Ramtek judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) on Wednesday.
 
 A total of 17 accused were arrested in poaching of five tigers in and around Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Maharashtra, in June and July last. While one accused Mahadeo Uikey died after fleeing from custody, other 16 were granted bail by Ramtek JMFC MS Banchare on September 1 & 5. 
 
 The forest department had challenged the Ramtek court order in sessions court. The court rejected bail of all the accused following which the accused moved the high court. The high court too rejected their anticipatory bail applications.
