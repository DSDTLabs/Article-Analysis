 Salma told cops that she belonged to Murshidabad in West Bengal but was now residing in Delhi. She was arrested in 2006 but was released on bail. She then started selling ganja and tied up with a supplier from Odisha.
 
 Shankar informed cops that he used to work as dry-cleaner in Tamil Nadu but after an accident, he moved to Delhi and started peddling drugs.
 
 Police said that Jagbandhu, a driver by profession, came in contact with the Halender — a resident of Odisha. Halender lured him to join the peddling business and both started procuring ganja from remote areas in Odisha. This was then transported to Delhi through car. Later, they came in contact with Rajgir, who had earlier worked with Halender.
 
 Rajgir, who had contacts with a number of drug peddlers in Delhi-NCR, helped Halender supply the marijuana through them. He got Rs 12,000 for delivering each consignment.
