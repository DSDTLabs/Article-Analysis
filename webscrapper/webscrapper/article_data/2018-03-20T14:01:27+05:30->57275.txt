KERI: Maharashtra is gearing to resume the   irrigation project work before the onset of the monsoon and the contractor has already brought   machines and trucks to the site. The work on the dam across the river Valvonti at Virdi in the Dodamarg taluka of Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg district was brought to a stop in 2015.

 The contractor V.I. Shetty and company, had completed work on the road leading to the dam site. “We have received instructions to resume work on the unfinished Virdi dam project and will do so within the week,” company officials said.
 
 “A team of water resources department officials will be sent to the Virdi dam site on March 20, and after the submission of the fact finding report we will take necessary steps,” chief engineer with the water resource department, Goa, Sandip Nadkarni told TOI. 
 
 Maharashtra is constructing the dam across the Valvonti river at Virdi, 4km from the Goa border, as a water conservation structure to store rainwater. As per the earlier plans, when released, the water from the dam was to flow downstream towards Goa. 
 
 However, Maharashtra, without discussion with or consent from the Goa government, shifted the dam alignment to Kattika nall, a sub-tributary of the Valvonti river. It has completed a major part of the work on the earthen dam without obtaining necessary environment clearance and without carrying out any feasibility studies in the context of disaster management.
 
 Recently, Karnataka stopped work on the Kalasa canal project at Kankumbi after Goa raised serious objections before the Mhadei Water Dispute Tribunal. The Kalsa project site is located east of the Virdi dam site in the Sahyadris on the confluence of borders of three states of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra.
