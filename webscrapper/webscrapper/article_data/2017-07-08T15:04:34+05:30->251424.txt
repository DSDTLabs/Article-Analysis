PANAJI: A day after the   sought clarification on implementing of the central master plan for artificial recharge of groundwater, the state’s water resources department expressed its inability to implement it fully.

 A bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice   on Thursday asked state governments to submit their affidavits, clarifying whether they would be implementing the master plan for artificial recharge of groundwater in India. The court, in its directive, had mentioned that several states, including Goa, had not yet filed their compliance affidavits. The affidavits were to be submitted by Friday.
 
 Sharing that the state will be submitting a formal response to the court in the coming days, chief engineer   of the water resources department said that the central master plan, which was drafted in 2013, at best can be used for directional purposes, but not entirely. 
 
 “The central master plan’s recommendations do not match Goa’s requirements. They can be used as guides to build future infrastructure. The basic issue is that the central plan takes in macro-level surveys whereas Goa employs micro-level surveys. Our dependency on groundwater is 33%, which is under permissible limits, unlike many states that have a 100% dependency. We have our notified scheme on water harvesting and are front-runners in conservation of groundwater table,” he told TOI, adding that the affidavit summarizing the reasons of non-compliance will be submitted in the coming days to the Supreme Court.
 
 The state had launched its rooftop rainwater harvesting scheme in 2008 giving up to 50% subsidy.
