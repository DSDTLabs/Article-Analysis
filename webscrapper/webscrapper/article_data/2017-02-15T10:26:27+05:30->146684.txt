 Jyoti also addressed an election meeting in Maharajpur in support of BJP candidate Satish Mahana. Sources said that Joshi had held a meeting with Satendra Pandey, general secretary and other leaders of the local unit of BJP and discussed issues related to elections.
 
 Apart from wooing voters at booth level, he also discussed about the star campaigners of BJP, who had visited city and garnered support for the party candidates, party sources added that veteran leader would start interacting with the party candidates contesting from various seats.
 
 The veteran leader is expected to give 'guru mantra' to probable candidates on how to win elections. "Prime minister   has always emphasised that a polling booth is the birthplace of an election victory. BJP has again roped in workers at every booth," district BJP chief Surendra Maithani said.
 
 "In Lok Sabha elections, BJP had managed to attract voters with Modi as the party's face and bagged 73 seats. Again, we are going in each and every area with the help of the booth level workers and projecting Modi's work during his two-and-a-half-year tenure," Maithani added.
