Remember the amber eyed Aswathi Menon, in the film Satyam Sivam Sundaram? 

 The bubbly actress, who debuted in the movie, was away from big screen for a while. And now, she is all set to make a comeback with the Fahadh-starrer  , directed by Rafi.
 Aswathi says she is excited that her second innings will also be helmed by Rafi, who launched her as an actress. 'Though I was initially nervous to be back on the sets, my faith in Rafi ikka restored my confidence. It is a terrific opportunity to return to films, that too in one, which has   in the lead role,' she says.
 
  On her role, she says, 'I play Lucy, who is from Goa. Though it's a small role, it is pivotal to the plot. I am hopeful that my acting would be noticed and it will leave a mark.'
 Ask Ashwathi how she landed the part and she says, 'As soon as I landed in India, I happened to talk to Rafi ikka. He casually asked me to come to Goa, and I was thinking it would be a good vacation for me. After a while, he asked me to send a few snaps of mine, which I did. Soon, I got a call from him, asking me to pack the bags and get on-board to Goa for a shoot!'
 
  So, what kept her busy these years? The actress says that back then, the roles that were coming her way were not exciting. 'Also, my family moved to Dubai. And, I embarked on a new trail as a marketing manager in a firm. Though I was not part of films, I was doing theatre productions and that kept me busy and connected with the art world.'
 
 Before signing off, she says that it was her family's constant support that brought her back to films. 'My husband always tells me to follow my passion and pursue things I love to do. I am happy that I started acting again.'
