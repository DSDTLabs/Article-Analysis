Panaji: Based on the clearance granted by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Indian Navy, the tender for the construction of a parallel taxiway at Goa International Airport (GOI), Dabolim, has been floated and the contract is expected to be awarded by the end of March, Goa airport officials said.

 “The tender is in the award stage. The bids will be evaluated and by the end of the month, the tender should be awarded to the successful contractor,” airport director Bhupesh Negi said.
 
 AAI has also begun the process to install new aerobridges at the new domestic and international terminal at the civilian enclave at Dabolim.
 
 The two projects, once implemented, will help reduce runway congestion and improve the efficiency of the airport terminal, airport officials said.
 
 Currently, after a commercial airliner lands at Dabolim, it has to use the same runway or the taxi track on the southern side of the airport to reach the terminal, which causes a 15 minute delay. The delay increases if the existing aerobridges are occupied by other passenger airliners.
 
 According to AAI’s proposal which has been tendered, a full length parallel taxi track suitable for B747 type of aircraft will be constructed along the northern side of runway 08-26. The taxi track will be 3.7 kilometers long with a continuous shoulder of 10.5 meters.
 
 The proposal will require strengthening of existing taxiways, development paths connecting the taxiway to the runway and the parking bay, replacement of air washer unit, relocation of water and electrical facilities, and construction of a new perimeter road.
 
 It was in early 2008 that authorities floated the idea of a new parallel taxiway, but the plan failed to see the light of day even after the new terminal was built and commissioned.
 
 With over 70 flights operating from Goa airport, air passenger traffic is expected to cross 6.2 million in 2016-17, AAI officials said.
