New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation is game for some brand building. So it has decided to hire wrestler sisters Geeta and Babita Phogat, and another international para athlete whose name hasn’t been finalised yet, to promote its “achievements” in sanitation and solid waste management. 

 “We will call the Phogat sisters in several events where we will highlight our achievements such as improvement in sanitation, biggest LED streetlighting project among others,” said a senior corporation official. The administrative nod came during a standing committee meeting on Thursday. 
 
 Shailendra Singh, standing committee chairman, said, “The choice is in accordance with the commitment to save the girl child through ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’ and provide facilities to the divyangs (differently abled). We were also in contact with some cricketers, but favoured the sisters in tune with women empowerment. They are also immensely popular in Delhi’s rural areas.” 
 
 SDMC will now use photographs, audio and video of the three ambassadors for print, radio and TV commercials. 
 
 The Swachh Bharat survey or swachh survekshan, which rates cities based on their performance in various parameters, also takes into account the presence of a brand ambassador to popularise cleanliness. As many as eight points are awarded for this category and the south corporation had been losing them all until now. And the civic officials claim this is the first time the Phogat sisters are endorsing an agency. 
 
 Singh clarified that no neta would appear in corporation banners. 
 
 Though the overall cost hasn’t been divulged, officials say it would roughly cost the corporation around Rs 30-35 lakh. 
 
 The corporation is also hiring a PR agency for its election campaign.
