HYDERABAD:A Jain temple, estimated to be constructed around eight century AD and converted into a Lord Shiva temple in the 10th century in Jadcharla of   district, is lying in a shambles.

 It is known as   temple and is located on the banks of  , a tributary of the river Krishna near Jadcharla in Mahabubnagar district.
 
 According to Telangana Jagruti History wing expert Sri Ramoju Haragopal, “The original temple is in a dilapidated condition. The statute of Lord   was kept aside in the temple. An inscription found in the temple reveals that one Agastya guru converted the temple into that of Lord Shiva during the last days of the rule of Krishna Rashtrakuta-3.”
 
 “A statue of a goddess carved during the   period was found in the middle of the river. The statute resembles Chamundi. The original temple gets immersed when the tributary is in full spate during the rainy season. We found fossilized trees that may be as old as 1,300 years old,” Haragopal added.
 
 Rashtrakuta king Krishna-3 ruled between 939 and 967 AD and installed the inscription. “During the last of the Rashtrakutas, the kingdom was in trouble and there was no protection for Jain and Buddhist temples. Subsequently, it was converted into a temple for Shiva. There is enough evidence to indicate that this temple belonged to Jains,” said Haragopal.
 
 Due to the complete apathy of the state government, locals are trying to restore the temple themselves. “The government should come forward and restore the temple as it has got a lot of historical significance,” said a local resident.
