Mumbai: Two years after the Deonar dumping ground fire, the BMC on Wednesday tabled a proposal before the   to build a   at a cost of Rs 8 crore to prevent such incidents. The members kept the proposal on hold for further discussion and condemned the civic administration for the delay.

 In February 2016, a massive fire broke out at Deonar dumping ground. Firemen struggled for more than a month to bring it under control. Ragpickers were held responsible for burning garbage to retrieve valuables. It was then decided that the BMC would restrict their entry by deploying security and building a boundary wall. 
 
 BJP group leader Manoj Kotak said, “The BMC didn’t do anything for two years and now it has presented this proposal. We had asked the administration to explain the status of the closure of dumping grounds...Also, the contractor who was managing   was to build the wall, but he quit.” 
 
 But SP corporator Rais Saikh said, “The standing committee members are delaying the proposal by keeping it on hold.” —Vijay V Singh
