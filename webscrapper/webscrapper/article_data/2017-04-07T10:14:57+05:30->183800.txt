AMRITSAR: Ten-year-old Hina, who will leave for Pakistan along with her mother and aunt, both Pakistani nationals, after their release from jail here, has another long drawn battle ahead of her. Since she was born to Fatima while in jail, she is an Indian national. 

 "Hina has to travel to Pakistan on an Indian passport and obtain the visa from the Pakistan High Commission. As per international law, the child becomes a citizen of country where he or she takes birth. So Hina is an Indian national," said advocate  . She will have to go through all the formalities to become a citizen of Pakistan, he added.
 
 Fatima and Mumtaz were arrested at Attari in May 2006, after they were found smuggling narcotics into India, and booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. 
 
 They were jailed for 10-and-a-half years, which got completed in November 2016. The court had slapped a fine of Rs 2 lakh each and in case of non-payment of fine, both had to serve another two years in jail. 
 
 Batala-based   president   told TOI on Thursday that they had deposited the fine imposed by court. 
 
 Meanwhile, the president of the   advocate  , who is facilitating the release of two Pakistani women and Hina, said she had met the three in jail on Thursday. 
 
 "Both of them are very happy with their early release and have expressed gratitude towards everyone pursuing their case and have also urged the Pakistan government and NGOs there to come forward to help the Indians lodged in their country's jails," she said.
