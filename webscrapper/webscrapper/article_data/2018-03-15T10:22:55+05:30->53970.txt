BENGALURU:   will divest its hosted data centre services business to Chicago-based hybrid IT services provider   for $405 million (about Rs 2,650 crore). 

 Wipro said it will transition eight data centres and over 900 employees to Ensono. The acquisition significantly expands Ensono's geographic footprint and global service capabilities. 
 
 As part of the agreement, Wipro will make an investment of $55 million in Ensono's combined entity. The two have signed a long-term partnership agreement to jointly address the hybrid IT need for Wipro's new and existing enterprise customers. 
 
 "Our strategic investment and partnership with Ensono will enable us to remain committed to meeting the hosted data centre services requirements of our customers," said  , SVP (global infrastructure services), Wipro. 
 
 Hosted data centres manage the IT infrastructure requirements of companies so that the latter do not have to get into the hassle of owning and managing this infrastructure. Clients access the centre from internet or through a secure private network. Last year, Ensono acquired Attenda, a UK-based pure-play provider of critical applications and hybrid IT-managed services.
