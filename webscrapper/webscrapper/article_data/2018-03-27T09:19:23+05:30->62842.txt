NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: At a time when the aggrieved old guard of the Indian cricket board ( ) has got together to take on the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators ( ), the Delhi   has directed the Delhi & District Cricket Association ( ) to hold elections within eight weeks.

 
 In its order on March 23, the court has asked DDCA administrator, Justice Vikramjit Sen, to carry out the amendments to the DDCA constitution in two weeks and publish it on the association’s website. “The administrator shall take steps to ensure that elections, in accordance with the said articles of association, are held within eight weeks,” the order read. The last time elections were held in DDCA was in 2014.
 
 Acting BCCI president CK Khanna, who has served as a DDCA office-bearer for over two decades, has welcomed the move. “I think it’s time to get moving. DDCA needs to be back functioning normally,” Khanna told TOI. Khanna is not qualified to contest the elections as per the Lodha recommendations.
 
 Last year, Justice Sen had called a general body meeting to pass the required amendments as per Lodha recommendations and the company’s act. But the members voted against most of the reforms and Sen has been running the association since.
 
 DDCA members had objected to several Lodha recommendations which were set aside by the court. For example, members had challenged the nine-year tenure cap suggested by Lodha. The court, citing this would defeat the idea of stopping administrative monopolies, dismissed the plea. “The plea to give prospective effect, in essence is a cry of existing directors who might be staring at the 9-year tenure restriction, to somehow get a ‘look in’ into fresh election process. It has no merit and accordingly rejected,” the order stated.
