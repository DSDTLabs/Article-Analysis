Noida: The   (HYV), an organisation established by  , declared on Wednesday that it would start a campaign against those meat shops in   which are either running without licence or where meat is being cut outside the shops.

 While most of the roadside mutton/chicken/fish shops running without licence have already been shut down by the Noida police or the Noida Authority, the outfit says it has information about certain areas where these shops are operating without any licence or stalls have been placed outside the shops where meat is being cut.
 
 Starting from Gijhor in Sector 53 around 12 noon, the HYV organised a bike rally which passed through Hoshiarpur, Sector 37, Atta Market, Naya Baans, Jhundpura and Spice Mall to finish at Gijor. It caused slight disruptions in traffic along its route.
 
 Meanwhile, the police said that no unlawful activity — meat shop without licence or forced closure of registered shops — would be allowed. “Most shops running without licence have already been shut. If some illegal shops are still there, we will take action against the shopkeeper concerned. Information can come from anywhere. However, if there is unnecessary harassment, law will take its course,” SP (City) Dinesh Yadav told TOI.
