HYDERABAD: Finding it difficult to accept a single judge order dismissing the plea of two farmers who lost their land in  , a division bench of the   on Monday referred the matter back for a fresh hearing saying that citizens have the right to invoke the jurisdiction of constitutional courts when they are being dispossessed.

 The bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi was hearing an appeal by Boyinapalli Shantamma and another farmer from Karukonda village in Bijinapally mandal of the district. Appearing for the farmers, senior counsel S   said that their three acres was taken over illegally by   Infra Pvt Ltd company with the aid of Bijinapally tahsildar and other revenue authorities without any land acquisition proceedings. HES is a contractor for a part of   Lift Irrigation Project.
 
 
 The senior counsel said the farmersâ€™ land had been dug up by the company to lay a bund without the authorities and the company following due process of law. But a single judge earlier dismissed the plea at the threshold stage itself and asked the petitioners to go to a civil court to establish their claims over the land.
 
 The HC bench said citizens have a right to invoke the jurisdiction of the high court and relegating them to a civil court may not be the right option. The bench set aside the single judge order and referred the case back to the single judge court for a fresh hearing. It also directed the state to file its counter within 15 days.
