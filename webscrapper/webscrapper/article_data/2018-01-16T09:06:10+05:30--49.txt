 "We want Karachi free from the control of Islamabad. We want Karachi to be free from atrocities of the security forces. We want an immediate end to the human rights violations of the people of Karachi," said Nadeem Nusrat, the US-based former convener of Muhair's mainstream political party, Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) said.
 
 The protesters said they would approach Congressmen, policy makers and even President   to raise their issue.
 
 The term 'Muhajir' is used to describe the Urdu-speaking immigrants who left India in 1947 and came to Pakistan. A large chunk of them settled in the Sindh province.
