VIJAYWADA: The once permanent chirpy guests in every household of  , the house sparrows, are a rarity now, thanks to   and setting up of cell towers across the city. 

 On   on March 20, a few residents in the city talked about their memories of this once-common bird. "It has been almost 10 years since I saw a house sparrow. I remember getting excited when a pair of sparrows built a nest in our apartments when I was a kid. I fear that my children might not be able to enjoy their beauty at all," said  , a mother of two and a resident of an apartment in Mogalrajpuram.
 
 The other women in the apartment shared the same opinion. "Sparrows are very persistent. We had to yield to its fight and allow the bird to have its nest in our switch board. And to understand that human intervention is causing birds with such strong survival skills to perish, is a disheartening," added Latha, a housewife in the apartment complex. 
 
 According to a survey of  , the number of house sparrows has drastically fallen in the last couple of years and the birds are almost on the verge of extinction. They are being shooed away from the city by the radiation effect from the cell towers, decry environmentalists.
