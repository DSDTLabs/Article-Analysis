  : Irked by large potholes caused by leakage from a broken water pipeline in the middle of the road,   villagers erected plantains in the broken parts of the road at the Ambaulim junction in protest on Thursday. 

 The three-road junction at Ambaulim bifurcates towards Balli and Cuncolim. The 450mm cast iron water pipeline supplying water to Cuncolim, Assolna and   from Quepem had broken about ten 10 days ago.
 
 The continuous gushing of water in the middle of the road had caused much damage resulting big potholes.
 
 "This stretch has become an accident-prone zone," former sarpanch of Ambaulim Mahendra Balle said.
 
 Annoyed over PWD's failure to repair the road, Ambaulim villagers first placed plantains in the potholes and marched to PWD (roads) office at Quepem. 
 
 They raised slogans demanding immediate repairs and threatened to hold a sit in dharna outside office if their demand was not complied with by Friday morning.
 
 Officials from PWD (road) section immediately requested the water supply section to carry out repair work. The leakage was plugged, but the road has not been repaired, sources said.
 
 Digging activity was carried out to plug the leakage, leaving the road vulnerable to accidents, villagers said.
 
 Public works department (PWD) engineer Digamber Kulkarni said that instructions have been issued to repair on the road.
