Former TV actress and politician,   turned 41 on March 23. She received messages from her friends and colleagues, but one special message was from TV's czarina  . The producer of most hit TV show's   took to Instagram to share a picture of hers with   and wished belated birthday to the former actress.
 
  Ekta is all gaga over Smriti as she heaped praises on the Union Minister, who once played the role of Tulsi Virani in hit TV show 'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.'
  
  
 
  
  She wrote, "A friend an amazing actor a super multitasker a visionary leader n a genuine human being u juggle all these tittles so well! Happy belated bday @smritiirani_in."
  
  
  
  The two, who worked together in one of the longest running shows on Indian television Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, had a fall out in 2007 when Smriti was replaced by Gautami Kapoor as Tulsi.
  
  Smriti was brought back on the show a year later, but the two couldn't share the same equation as they shared before. However, with time the differences faded away and the two started meeting each other often at Diwali and Holi parties.
  
  They were last seen bonding at the Diwali bash held at Ekta Kapoor's house.
  
  Smriti, who started her career with this Ekta Kapoor show, was allegedly miffed with the director/producer and went her way to doing many other shows, out of which none were with Ekta. She has now quit TV and is focusing on her political career.
