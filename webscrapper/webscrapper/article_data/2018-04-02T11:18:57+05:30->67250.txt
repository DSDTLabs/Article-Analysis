TRICHY: A year after several crores of rupees were spent in a massive movement involving public and government bodies to weed out   (Prosopis juliflora), it seems that the invasive plant species is making a comeback in  . The debate on whether the exotic trees are a threat to the environment is still on, but their return has exposed the unscientific method adopted by the government agencies and public in removing them.

 
 After a directive from the Madurai bench of the Madras high court in December 2016, a massive movement against the invasive species was conducted across 13 central and southern districts of the state including Trichy. School and college students and youths were roped in to uproot the thickets which are said to be causing depletion of groundwater. District administrations and civic bodies used their own resources to eliminate the exotic species. Later, based on a PIL filed against felling Seemai Karuvelam without a scientific study, the   in April 2017 stayed the felling of Seemai Karuvelam thickets. Following this, the administration and local bodies kept away from the drive. Now, the thickets have started sprouting again with questions from many corners about the manner in which the trees were removed last year.
