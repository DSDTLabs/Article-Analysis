Indore: After receiving a good response from various districts in the state, Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation (MPSTDCL) has tied up with private tour and travel operators to promote its Home Stay scheme.

 The move comes in line of an increasing number of Home Stay accommodations in cities like Indore and Bhopal and also to supplement the need of accommodations in other cities of the state.
 
 “We have tied up with an online private tour and travel firm to promote our scheme,” said MPSTDCL’s regional manager SK Gupta. He said that the company will promote and help implement this scheme to attract more tourists.
 
 He said the corporation, with the help of a private company, is focused on creating more awareness about the benefits among people who wish to register themselves under this scheme. The company has also introduced a mobile app through which people who join can receive real time updates of bookings against their accommodations.
 
 “We also conduct workshops for people who join. We focus on creating awareness among owners of apartments/bungalows/cottages who can provide accommodation and food to domestic and international tourists,” he added.
 
 Officials with MPSTDCL said this will also let property owners share their culture, cuisine, customs and lifestyle of their area. The scheme also ensures a recurring source of income for property owners, they said.
 
 Officials also claimed there is a good response to the scheme so far, especially in Indore. More than 90 people from different districts of the state have registered their property under this scheme.
