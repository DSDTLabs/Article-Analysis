PATNA: West   Keshari Nath Tripathi has described peasant   as the ‘beej purush (progenitor)’ of   movement a century ago as he persuaded Mahatma Gandhi to visit Champaran indigo farmers facing excesses of Britishers.

 “Shukla was the original voice of Champaran farmers,” Tripathi said, adding Gandhi heard him and became their voice.
 
 Tripathi was giving inaugural address at a function held at Kalakunj in Kolkata on Sunday to celebrate the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi’s arrival at Kolkata in April 1917 and his subsequent departure for Patna to visit Champaran via Muzaffarpur. The function was organised by Bhitiharwa Ashram Jeewan Kaushal Trust led by Shailendra Pratap Singh.
 
 Tripathi said it was Shukla who apprised Gandhi of the situation facing the farmers in Champaran, knowing that Gandhi, being a practising satyagrahi, alone was capable of finding a solution for their problems. He said knowledge about the Champaran movement would help new generations find ideals for them. 
 
 Among those who also addressed the function were litterateur   and JD (U) Rajya Sabha member Harivansh. 
 
 “Shukla was not just afflicted by his own anxiety, but also assimilated the problems and concerns of other farmers and set out to find a solution with the help of Gandhi,” Mishra said.
 
 Trust head Singh said such functions would be held at all the places Gandhi visited during the movement. Educationist Gyandeo Tripathi conducted the proceedings. On the occasion, docu-drama ‘Neele rang ki lal kahani’ was also performed.
