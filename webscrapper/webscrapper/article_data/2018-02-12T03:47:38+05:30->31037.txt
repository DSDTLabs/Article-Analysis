MUMBAI: A day after having to cancel their annual  , which was scheduled for Sunday, due to delay in police permission, residents of  's   said their   on Sunday was marred due to interruptions by cops. A posse of cops landed at the venue four times, warning residents to keep the music down. Eventually, they got   along and found that the sound was 56.2 db. They did not turn up thereafter.

 “We organised football and basketball between 8am and 5pm on Sunday, in the run up to the carnival. A sports event does not need police permission. We had a single loudspeaker that played music only between matches,” said Randell Pereira of IC Colony Forum.
 
 An   station official said they had received calls from two people, complaining of loud music. “The residents were warned to keep the music down,” said the official. The cops turned up at the venue between 11am and 1pm. At 4 pm, a police van made rounds of the spot.
 
 As the police permission for the carnival planned for Sunday (February 11) came only late Saturday, the residents called off the scheduled event. Now, they have sought permission to hold the carnival on Tuesday. 
 
 The police said they were refusing permission for the carnival as the residents had roped in a DJ. “We had been making rounds of the police station for 15 days... We were asked to come to the police station on Monday and told that a nod would finally be given. But we have now learnt that after police visits at the sports event on Sunday, the permission for the carnival may never come. We will now go to court," said former corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar from Shiv Sena.
