NEW DELHI: Congress is likely to move amendments to the GST bills, but the leadership has advised its MPs that they should not come across as blocking the tax reform. 

 At a strategy meeting presided over by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Lok Sabha MPs shared their concern over jurisdiction issues, “federal issues” and some other provisions in the GST bills which they felt required improvement. It was decided that Congress will register its reservations on the bills. 
 
 However, Rahul is learnt to have told the MPs that the criticism should be constructive and the party was in favour of the tax reform which was initiated by the UPA. Former Union minister Veerappa   will open the Congress’s arguments over the GST bills and is likely to touch upon the questionable provisions. 
 
 Sources said there were clauses which took away the power of taxation from Parliament and vested them in the GST Council which was not acceptable. Also, the party is against the tax slab ceiling of 40% and wants a low rate.
