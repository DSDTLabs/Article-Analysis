NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   on Sunday said his government had removed a discriminatory practice where Muslim women were allowed to travel for   only in the company of a ‘mahram’ or  .

 Wondering how such “injustice” was being rendered to Muslim women for decades, Modi said, “Our ministry of minority affairs issued corrective measures and we ameliorated this restriction by phasing out a tradition that had been in practice for the past 70 years.” 
 
 “Today, Muslim women can perform Haj without ‘mahram’ and I am happy to note that this time about 1,300 Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without  ,” the PM said in his monthly radio address ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
 
 Noting that such a restriction was not prevalent in many Islamic countries, Modi said, “When I first heard about it, I wondered how it could be possible. Who would have drafted such rules? Why this discrimination? And when I went into the depth of the matter I was surprised to find that even after 70 years of our independence, we were the ones who had imposed these restrictions.
 
 For decades, injustice was being rendered to Muslim women but there was no discussion on it. Even in many Islamic countries, this practice does not exist. But Muslim women in India did not have this right. And I'm glad that our government paid heed to this matter.”
 
 He said he has suggested to the minority affairs ministry that they should ensure that all women who have applied to travel alone be allowed to perform Haj. “Usually, there is a lottery system for selection of Haj pilgrims but I would like that single women pilgrims should be excluded from this lottery system and they should be given a chance as a special category,” Modi said.
