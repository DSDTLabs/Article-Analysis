GURUGRAM:   on Saturday came down heavily on the state government for taking a “pro-builder stand” in the Haryana Real Estate Regulation and Development Act (HRERA). 

 The anti-graft party alleged the government is hand-in-glove with the developers, which is why   has been diluted to benefit them instead of homebuyers.
 
 AAP’s Haryana chief Naveen Jaihind said reports on RERA was highly disappointing for the public as the government kept the developers’ interest in mind while it conveniently forgot the people who voted for it in the assembly elections. 
 
 “The most important thing while formulating an act is to define the terms being used in the same. By leaving hundreds of projects outside the purview of the act by changing the definition of an ongoing project beats the whole purpose of having an act in the first place,” Jaihind said at a press meet in Gurgaon. “As per our estimate, around 300,000 people in are right now facing problems with projects which have been brought under HRERA. There has been an uproar about the definition of an ‘on-going project’ among the homebuyers about RERA,” he said.
 
 The prty also questioned outstanding external development charges amounting to Rs 12,000 crore from more than 700 projects, to be paid by the developers to Huda. “Huda has submitted a false affidavit in the Punjab and Haryana high court, showing an expenditure of Rs 3,000 crore in external development charges,” said Jaihind.
