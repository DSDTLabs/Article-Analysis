A few weeks ago, BT reported how   was undergoing stress due to non-payment of dues from the producers of '  Baati Hum'. But it seems that the actress has better things to look forward to in 2017. Deepika and her husband director   are expecting their first child; the actress just completed her first trimester. She said, “I had gone out of town for a holiday and fell sick. I had to return and consult my doctor. That’s when he gave us the good news about my pregnancy. My parents, in-laws and husband are extremely happy. Having a baby is such a beautiful experience, which I feel is unique for every woman. My family is superstitious so we were hesitant to announce this news earlier. I support and understand their emotions. Both   and I are looking forward to this new phase in our lives and pray to God that everything turns out to be good this year.”
