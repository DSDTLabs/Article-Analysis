CHENNAI: Talk about driving people around the bend.

 Peeved by worried protests that they were travelling too fast on the steep hills along the Dindigul-Kodaikanal road, a   ( )   on Tuesday evening turned the alarm of 70 passengers into dismay by suddenly halting the vehicle, hopping onto another bus passing by and going his own way.
 
 He left behind the conductor, too, for good measure.
 
 By the time the conductor contacted the TNSTC   depot manager, who sent a spare driver to the spot to drive them to  , the driver had left the passengers stranded for more than two hours.
 
 The disconcerted passengers later informed officials that the driver stepped on the gas as soon as they crossed the Dindigul city limits, speeding recklessly without appearing to bother about vehicles heading in the opposite direction.
 
 Some of the passengers asked the driver to slow down but to no avail. As the speeding vehicle crossed Kodaikanal Ghat Road, and things got really dangerous, the passengers’ nervous complaints turned into a confrontation.
 
 “Without warning, the hotheaded driver halted the vehicle and, without a word, got on another bus heading to Dindigul,” a TNSTC official said. “Expecting a complaint by the passengers, the driver admitted himself to Bathlagundu Government Hospital.” 
 
 The passengers had no choice but to wait on the highway as darkness enveloped the hills.
 
 “Senior officials have suspended the driver and started an internal inquiry,” he said, refusing to name the driver because of the ongoing probe, but stating that he was in his forties and had recently received a posting to Dindigul.
