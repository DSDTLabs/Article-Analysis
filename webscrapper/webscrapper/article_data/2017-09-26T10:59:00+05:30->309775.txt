CHENNAI: Around 10 passengers travelling on an   bus escaped with minor injuries after the vehicle met with an accident in the   subway on Monday morning.

 Police said the bus turned sharply and jumped a median before coming to a halt. The accident took place when the driver applied sudden brakes to avoid hitting a biker in front of the bus. The vehicle blocked the road for two hours before police removed it from the spot with a crane.
 
 The bus (102-K) was heading from   to the   bus terminus when the accident took place. Police said a morning drizzle left the road wet, causing the vehicle to skid and jump the median before coming to a stop crossways across the road.
 
 A police team from the Elephant Gate traffic investigation wing rushed to the spot and sent the injured, including the bus driver,  , to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. Police used a metro rail crane to remove the bus and allow free flow of traffic again. By then, traffic had been blocked for two hours.
 
 Ateam of MTC officials have visited the site and examined the vehicle to ascertain if a mechanical fault caused the accident. The vehicle has been towed to the MTC depot on Pallavan Salai. The Elephant Gate traffic investigation wing police have registered a case.
