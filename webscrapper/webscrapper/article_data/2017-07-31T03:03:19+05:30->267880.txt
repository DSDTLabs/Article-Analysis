ULHASNAGAR: A 22-year-old   suffering labour pain was forced to wait for nearly five hours as staffers at state-run   in   refused to admit her claiming the sonography operator was unavailable on Sunday. The staffers allegedly told her labourer husband that they would admit her after he got the test done at a private hospital and get the report. 

 As per rules, if a medical facility is unavailable in the hospital, doctors are supposed to stabilize the patient and refer him to a higher centre by arranging for an ambulance. If the patient is critical, a paramedic is supposed to accompany him.
 
 It was only after a local   intervened that the woman, Hamza Ansari, was admitted into the hospital around 11am. She delivered a girl in the evening.
 
 The hospital has initiated an internal   into the incident. “Following the MLA’s complaint, I have initiated a probe against the staffers who did not attend to the woman,” said Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, medical superintendent, Central Hospital.
 
 Hamza lives with her husband in a chawl in Ulhasnagar no 1. Around 6am, she started having contractions and her husband and relatives brought her to Central Hospital. But the staffers refused to admit her saying the sonographer was not in. They suggested that she take the test at a private hospital. Ansari’s husband and relatives called up friends for help; someone suggested approaching local NCP MLA Jyoti Kalani. 
 
 Kalani first called at the hospital , but when no one attended to the call, she turned up at the hospital and confronted the staffers, who then admitted Ansari.
 
 Kalani said she will raise the issue in the monsoon session.
