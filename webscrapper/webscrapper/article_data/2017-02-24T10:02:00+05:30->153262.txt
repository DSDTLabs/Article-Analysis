 Investigating officers are trying to leverage the 24-hour window they have before presenting the accused in a magistrate court.
 
 According to an official with the DGP's office, the interrogation team has analyzed different factors which include the nature of the crime, the intensity of the  , the motive and the possible involvement of a third party in the crime.

 As per the statement given by the survivor, grievous sexual assaults were committed against her. However, suspects arrested earlier had given statements that it was Suni who committed the sexual assault as others recorded the act on video. “The forensic report along with the survivor's statement will be cross checked to find the truth behind the claims made by the suspects,“ said a senior official.

 “The actor in her statement had stated that the main suspect made a reference to a contract given to them for recording her videos in compromising positions,“ said a senior official. Though cops consider this statement as a trick played by the gang to trick the actor and the investigators, they will also be probing the possibility of Suni being a hired hand.
