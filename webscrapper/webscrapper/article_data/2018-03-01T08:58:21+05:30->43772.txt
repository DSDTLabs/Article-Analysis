HYDERABAD: Five persons, including an   agent, were nabbed by Task Force police on Wednesday for tampering chassis and engine number of bikes, especially  , and selling the refurbished vehicles to customers.

  (RTA) officials even registered these refurbished vehicles despite not having valid documents. Surprisingly, the Task Force officials did not touch the erring RTA officials.
 
 Task Force sleuths said two-wheeler broker Hitesh Patel, RTA agent A Vittal Rao, mechanics  , Hakeem Abu Naser, Mohammed Arif were nabbed and 15 Royal Enfield bikes, two 350 CC Yamaha bikes and 25 RC books were seized from their possession. Hitesh Patel had been purchasing bikes from various places auctioning scrap bikes . At the time of auction, generally the chassis and engine number will be erased.
 
 “Hitesh used to purchase vehicles for ?28.000 and resell the bike for ?35,000 without documents. If the purchaser requests for documents, Hitesh will demand ?20,000-30,000 more for reach RC and used to arrange registration certificate (RC) through Vittal Rao, who used to bribe RTA officials, South Zone, without submitting any documents,’’ deputy commissioner of police (Task Force) P   said.
 
 Michal Modi used to re-model vehicles and alter engine and chassis number on the bikes. When asked why RTA officials were let off, the DCP said the arrested culprits were handed over to Bowempally and   police, who during their investigation would take action, if need be.
