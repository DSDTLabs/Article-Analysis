NEW DELHI:A   central team comprising party MPs Meenakshi Lekhi, Om Mathur and Satyapal Singh was stopped from visiting the riot-hit   in   and its members were detained on Saturday.

 The three MPs, who left for Basirhat after arriving here from Delhi, were stopped by the police near Birati, close to the airport.
 
 Later, they were detained when they tried to proceed to Basirhat after a heated exchange with the police.
 
 Lekhi asked the police if the situation was under control in Basirhat, as claimed by the state government, why were they not allowed to go there?
 
 "We are MPs and only we three will go there. You accompany us," she told policemen.
 
 The police, however, refused to allow them. 
 
 On Friday, police prevented BJP, Left and Congress delegations from visiting riot-hit areas in Basirhat even as the situation there remained tense and Internet services were suspended.
 
 Ignoring an appeal by West Bengal chief minister  , a BJP delegation led by MP Roopa Ganguly, which was heading towards Baduria, was detained by the police at Michael Nagar near   here.
 
 "We told the BJP leaders that they will not be allowed to proceed as per the decision of the administration. The situation is still tense. But they were adamant and said either they will court arrest or proceed towards the affected area. So we had to detain them," a senior police officer in Bidhannagar said.
