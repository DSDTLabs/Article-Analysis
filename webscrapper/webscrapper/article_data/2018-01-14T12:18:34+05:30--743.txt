NEW DELHI:   president   today accused BJP of harbouring a “discriminatory mindest” and treating the Indian migrant workers as “second class citizen” following the government's decision to introduce changes in the Indian passport.

 
 "Treating India's migrant workers like second class citizens is completely unacceptable. This action demonstrates BJP’s discriminatory mindset", he said in a tweet.
 
  
  
 On Friday, the government had decided to change the colour of the passport to orange for people with Emigration Check Required (ECR) status.
 
 “As the last page of the passport would not be printed now, the passport holders with ECR status would be issued a passport with orange colour passport jacket and those with non-ECR status would continue to get a blue passport,” said the MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar.
 
 The ministry had also announced that the last page of the passport, which, so far, contained the father or legal guardian's name, the names of the holder's mother, spouse and their address, will be kept blank, giving rise to speculations that the passport may no longer serve as a valid address proof.
 
 The changes were announced after recommendation of a three-member panel, comprising officials from the   and the ministry of women and child development.
