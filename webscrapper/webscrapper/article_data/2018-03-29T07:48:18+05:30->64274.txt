ROHTAK: Haryana Pradesh Congress committee president Ashok   on Wednesday demanded an apology from Delhi chief minister and   (AAP) convener   for favouring Punjab on the issue of Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal.

 Addressing media persons in   on Wednesday, Tanwar accused Kejriwal of changing his stand repeatedly to satisfy his political needs. “Instead of holding road show in Haryana, Kejriwal should atone for betraying the cause of Haryana, which he calls his motherland,” he said.
 
 Accusing   and AAP, former Sirsa MP Tanwar said people of Haryana should be wary of Kejriwal-style politics and saffron party for weakening the panchayati raj and educational institutions. “It’s a conspiracy of BJP and we are with sarpanchs and panchs in the hour of crisis,” he said. He said if voted to power in Haryana in 2019, Congress would strengthen the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) and restore the autonomy of educational institutions.
