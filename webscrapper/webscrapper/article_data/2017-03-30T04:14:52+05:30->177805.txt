NEW DELHI: A Twitter post on cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s   application by an excited enrolment centre official led to an online kerfuffle that also trended on Twitter on Wednesday.

 Allegations, apologies, and clarifications came at a rapid pace after the former Indian skipper’s wife Sakshi protested against her husband’s Aadhaar form — complete with his personal details — being posted from the government’s common services centre’s Twitter handle @CSCegov_.
 
 Union minister for information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad told a news agency on Wednesday that no personal details were revealed.
 
 The original tweet with the application snapshot was deleted.
 
 The controversy began after   tweeted on Tuesday night to Prasad complaining of a privacy breach. The tweet from @CSCegov_ she referred to read: “Ace cricketer   and his family get their Aadhaar updated at VLE Mariya Farooqui’s CSC at Ranchi, Jharkhand. @rsprasad.”
 
 It carried a picture of Dhoni with what looks like a CSC worker and a snapshot of his Aadhaar form.
 
 Prasad responded on Tuesday night itself, tweeting, “Thanks for bringing this to my notice. Sharing personal information is illegal.
 
 Serious action will be taken against this.” CSC, or Common Services Centres, are government-affiliated bodies where e-governance facilities, like signing up for Aadhaar in this case, are available. However, speaking to a news agency on Wednesday, Prasad said, “Man who made Aadhaar got excited to click Aadhaar photo with Dhoni. Personal details haven’t been revealed.”
 
 Sakshi, meanwhile, took to Twitter on Wednesday afternoon to thank strangers on the internet who texted to tell her about her husband’s details being published online.
 
 “Thanks to all the unknown ppl who msged me to warn me about the leak of personal info last evening...# makeindiasecure,” she tweeted, along with four screenshots of text messages.
