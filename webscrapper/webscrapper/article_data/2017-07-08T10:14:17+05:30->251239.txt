 The video shows the legislator being heckled by some men, somewhat akin to Kashmiri youths assaulting CRPF personnel on their way to poll duty in Srinagar on April 9.
 
 “Thappad khayain gaddaro ke hum itne bhi mazboor nahi, hum bharat maa ke sainik hain, koi mazdoor nahi, mut chhutti do, bas kaam yehi sab karne do, wetan aadha karo, lekin kutto mai goli bhardo.“ (We don't come here to get slapped or heckled, we are soldiers, not labourers.Reduce our wage, but let us shoot the dogs), the MLA sings.
 
 In a soliloquy , he also makes veiled attacks on the government.
 
 Defending his video, which has been uploaded on YouTube as well as his Facebook account, Verka said it was his responsibility as a party leader to focus on the attacks on Kashmiri cops and Army soldiers.
 
 “I am a nationalist and an Indian. I went there, used my acting skills to drive home a message, and I am proud of it,“ he added.
 
 Union minister Vijay Sampla said he would see the video and comment on it if derogatory language has been used against any political leader.
