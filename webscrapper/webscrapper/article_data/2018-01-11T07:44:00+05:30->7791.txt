Dharamshala: The Himachal government is planning to make it mandatory for doctors to prescribe only   to patients. As part of the move, chemists will also have to provide the most feasible economical medicines based on the salts prescribed by doctors. However, the government is also working on an option to prescribe branded medicines if the generic version is not available.

 Himachal health minister Vipin Singh Parmar said he visited various hospitals in the state as soon as he took charge and observed discrepancies in the prescription of generic medicines.
 
 “We are considering this move. I have asked the medical staff to consider options that can be worked out to provide cheap and best medicine to people,” he said, adding that the move was inspired by Prime Minister Narender Modi. “I heard the PM talking about generic medicines in one of his addresses. He is very keen to bring about such a move in the country,” he said.
 
 Parmar said doctors will have the option of prescribing other medicines if the generic versions were not available. “We also want to keep a check on chemists, who should not give expensive medicines if the doctor prescribes generic salts to patients,” he said. The minister said multinational companies working in the medicine sector are also involved in corrupt practices to exploit the Indian market, which they perceive as the biggest. 
 
 Talking about lack of doctors in hospitals, he said the government would fill 100 posts. “Walk-in-interviews have been started in medical colleges and the posts will be filled,” he said.
