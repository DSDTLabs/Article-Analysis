New Delhi: The Centre on Monday appointed Jammu & Kashmir chief electoral officer (CEO) Shantmanu as development commissioner (handicrafts) in the Union textiles ministry, even as the Anantnag parliamentary bypoll process is underway. The development came on a day the Union home ministry said it could spare only 30,000 central para-military personnel for the May 25 bypoll, as against 74,000 personnel sought by the Election Commission.

 Shantmanu’s appointment at the Centre was made with the prior nod of the EC and clearance was given before the Anantnag poll, originally scheduled for April 12. However, it was later deferred due to law and order concerns. “We had okayed posting of Shantmanu at the Centre, thinking that both Srinagar and Anantnag bypolls would be over by the time his new charge is announced. However, with postponement of the Anantnag bypoll to May 25, this announcement has come bang in the middle of the poll process,” said an EC functionary. 
 
 The functionary said the commission will now request the government to let Shantmanu continue as J&K CEO till the Anantnag polls are over. “He can take charge of his new assignment at the Centre as soon as the bypolls are done with,” he stated. 
 
 Meanwhile, the Union home ministry has conveyed to the EC that it can spare only half the number of central forces demanded by the EC to ensure foolproof security for the Anantnag bypoll. “We can give no more than 30,000 para-military personnel, given that the situation along the international border in J&K as well as in the hinterland is hot. Also, the central forces cannot be pulled out from the counter-Naxal grid in the wake of the Sukma attack,” said a home ministry officer. 
 
 An EC functionary said the discussions on extent of central forces to be deployed for May 25 bypoll were still underway and “the numbers cited so far are just conjectures”.
