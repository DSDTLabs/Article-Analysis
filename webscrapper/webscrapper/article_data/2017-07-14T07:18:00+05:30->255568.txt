GURUGRAM: In a noble move to revive the greenery in the area, residents of DLF-1 planted around 110 saplings over the last two days inside the urban forest that is spread over an area of 2,500 square yards. 

 According to residents, the land was lying vacant for the last two years after residents filed a complaint with the forest department over felling of more than 70 trees in the area. “It was quite disheartening to see grown trees being felled. I had complained to the forest department regarding this after which the felling was stopped. However, planting saplings on a bulldozed land was a challenge. I am happy that children and other residents came together to make the area green again,” said Anita  , who motivated the children and residents to revive the forest. 
 
 Badhwar shared that the children from the area visit the forest twice a day to water the plants. Fourteen-year-old Sugreev, who lives in a nearby slum, is happy to get the forest in his neighbourhood back. “We have planted five-feet tall trees and now the area resembles the forest we had a few years ago. We want to rebuilt our forest and so we water the plants every day,” he said.
 
 Savita Choudhary, president of E-block RWA in DLF-1, said, “I am happy that we have been able to revive the urban forest. Now the challenge is to raise each tree properly and make sure the survival is 100%. There is a need to not just plant, but adopt trees like children and raise them properly.”
 
 Talking about the importance of urban forest,  , an environmentalist, said, “Urban forests form the lungs of urban areas. These spaces improve the micro-climate of the area and help provide habitat for birds, animals, butterflies and various types of insects. Such small efforts can go in a long way to make the city greener and environment.”
