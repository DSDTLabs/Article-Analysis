PUDUCHERRY: Two   hurled country bombs at a   functioning inside a local bar, after the person running the canteen refused to give them money on Sunday in the Union territory.

 Police said the two rowdies, identified as Dina, of Koliyanur and Sugu, of L R Palayam, have been attempting to extort money from the person running a canteen inside a bar at Thirubhuvanai, on the outskirts of the town, on several occasions. The duo warned the owner of dire consequences if he failed to give them money whenever they demanded. However, the canteen owner did not pay heed to their repeated threats.
 
 Irked by his indifference, the two rowdies came to the bar again on Sunday and hurled five country bombs at the canteen, of which two exploded with a loud noise. The canteen workers and people in the bar ran helter-skelter to safety. No one was injured in the explosions. 
 
 In the melee, Dina also attempted to attack one of the canteen workers with a sharp weapon. But the worker managed to escape the bid. Soon, the rowdies fled the spot on a bike. Thirubhuvanai police registered a case against the rowdies and launched a hunt for them.
