GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat water supply and sewerage board ( ) is all set to begin charging for water supplied to village panchayats, nagarpalikas and even municipal corporations in the state. This has become necessary as many areas of the state are parched. The board had stopped charging for water supply from the year 2011-12.

 The decision to collect a charge for water was taken in the year 2007. It was decided that Rs 2 per 1000 litres would be collected from village panchayats, Rs 4 per 1000 litres from municipalities and Rs 6 per 1000 litres from municipal corporations.
 The matter of invoices not being issued for water supply came to light when the independent auditor in his 2015-16 report for the GWSSB pointed out that since 2011-12, the board had stopped issuing invoices for supply of water. The report states: “GWSSB is required to raise invoices for supply of water to rural areas, based on the fixed rate per 1000 liters. However, till financial year 2011-12, certain divisions had raised invoices at the old rates only.”
 
 Senior officials of the GWSSB said that according to the Government   (GR) of 2007, there would an increase of 10% each year in the amount charged for water supply. According to the 2007 GR, the charge for rural areas was Rs 2 per 1000 liters. In 2008, it was to be increased to Rs 2.20 per 1000 liters. However, since the government did not issue the order required to raise the charge by 10%, several divisions continued to issue water bills at the rate of only Rs 2 per 1000 litre. GWSSB officials said that the board supplies 3,250 million litres of water per day in the state. The board has to recover of Rs 800 crore which the panchayats, the municipalities and corporations have failed to pay.
 
 In the absence of funds, the water board is finding it difficult to keep up supply. Hence it has once again decided to start raising funds from the civic bodies. Officials said that the department is likely to send a proposal to the government that in case of failure to clear the dues, the government should deduct the same from grants given to the civic bodies and give the money to the water board.
