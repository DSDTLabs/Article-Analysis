KOCHI: People who buy liquor from a   have no right to create a scene there by   and police should take serious action if they do so, the   has directed.

 The order was issued by a division bench of the court after considering a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by seven residents of Rayamangalam panchayat in Ernakulam whose houses are situated near a liquor retail sales outlet run by Kerala State Beverages Corporation Ltd (Bevco).
 
 It was alleged by the residents that consumers who buy liquor from the Bevco outlet are consuming it near the premises itself and are throwing the bottles helter-skelter. There are two schools in the area and the residents, including the children, are unable to pass through the road due to the trouble-mongers who come to purchase liquor and then consume it in open, the petition said.
 
 Allegations raised by the residents were supported by the panachayat in court and its counsel told the court that no licence has been issued to Bevco for running such an outlet. Bevco’s counsel submitted that denial of licence has been questioned before the high court and that the case is pending before another bench.
 
 Asking police to intervene, the court said in the judgment, “It is needless to observe that every person in the society should behave properly and the customers of the Corporation have got no right to create any law and order situation in the area in question. It is the responsibility of the Corporation also to control its customers if any problem is created by them. If the customers create problems by throwing bottles etc. to the road, it is open for the people in the locality to lodge complaint before the police, which shall be seriously taken note of by the jurisdictional police and necessary action shall be taken by them.”
