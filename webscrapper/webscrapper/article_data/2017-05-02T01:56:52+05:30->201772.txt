NEW DELHI: The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union has filed a   with the   Cell against at least three Twitter accounts for abuse of the university’s reputation and its women students. The student claims that these Twitter users are close to BJP-RSS.

 The three Twitter handles named in the complaint are ‘swamy_sena’, ‘swamy39’, ‘merabharat2011’. In the complaint,   has claimed that some Twitter users have posted objectionable comments in relation with JNU, especially women studying, teaching and working in JNU. The tweets mentioned in the complaint point specifically to those posted on April 30.
 
 According to the complaint, one such tweet shared an old media report with comments on the nature of the university from the account swamy_sena. “This tweet was shared by @swamy39, a verified account run by a person identifying himself as Subramanium Swamy — a Rajya Sabha MP and BJP national EC member,” said the complaint. They said the post was retweeted 654 times. Similarly, other accounts too posted objectionable content that was replied to subsequently in equally objectionable language.
 
 The students’ union also complained that in the last few days, several of university’s women students had received rape threats. The complaint pointed out that some users, being close to the political party in power, have come to believe that they have been given the license to make rape threats to the students and teachers of the university. The student group, in the letter, has sought an inquiry into the matter and urged that the errant accounts be reported.
