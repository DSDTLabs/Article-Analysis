NAVI MUMBAI: Residents of Kamothe, Kharghar, New Panvel and Kalamboli are facing   problems even after   hired a new contractor. The town planning agency has entrusted the disposal task to a new contractor on temporary basis following the termination of the contract with the old agency. 

 Despite formation of   ( ) on October 1 last year, Cidco has continued to look after the civic waste management system in these  . 
 
 The garbage lifting process has been streamlined and complaints may be from societies or areas not linked to its system which will be attended soon, said sources. 
 
 Cidco is finalising the tenders to appoint a new agency from April 1 for better civic waste management. Officials said that these nodes will be handed over to PCMC soon for handling waste management.
 
 Garbage accumulation is attributed to the absence of proper waste management system in place with the change of agencies from time to time. 
 
 Residents are irked over the lax attitude of Cidco’s solid waste management wing and hope that a civic body like NMMC and PCMC will provide better civic amenities on the health front. 
 
 “The situation remains the same after change of agency to handle the waste collection,” said a Kharghar resident Mohit Baldev.
 
  Dr B S Baviskar, chief health officer of Cidco said, “The waste clearing process has been streamlined. There has been no complaints reported from these nodes. In case of a problem, residents are requested to bring the matter to our notice which will be resolved.”
