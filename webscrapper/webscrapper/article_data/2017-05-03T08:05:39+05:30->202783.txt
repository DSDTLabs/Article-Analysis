VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater   (GVMC) in association with AECOM will survey the volume of vehicles moving at important junctions and locations in the city as part of the ‘smart city development plan’.

 AECOM is an American multinational engineering firm that provides design, consulting, construction and management services to a wide range of clients. The firm has appointed a consultancy named Sri Srinivasa Consultancy of Madhurawada to conduct the survey at 13 earmarked places between   and Lawson’s Bay Colony Junction.
 
 The consultancy will have to determine the turn movement count (TMC) and provide the origin and destination (OD) report in the earmarked points within the next two weeks.
 
 The 13 junctions include Lepakshi, Jagadamba, Green Park Hotel, Seven Hills Hospital, Governor’s Bungalow, Vuda Children’s Theatre, Siripuram Junction, CR Reddy Petrol Bunk, Palm Beach Circle, Kurupam Towers, Visakha Eye Hospital, Three Town Police Station and Lawson’s Bay Junction.
 
 Confirming this to TOI, GVMC’s   in-charge V Sudhakar said the survey would help prepare a comprehensive report for the smart city development plan. 
 
 K Srinivasa Rao, proprietor of the Srinivasa Consultancy, said they have appointed a team of 30 youth to conduct the survey. The team has to observe the TMC and OD every 15 minutes, he said. On Tuesday, the team started the survey with the Jagadamba junction which registered maximum of 200 motorcycles, 150 to 180 cars and 130 to 150 autos in a 15-minute period, he said. “We have to submit the report to AECOM,”   said.
 
 H Shiva Kumar, a member of team from Srinivasa Consultancy, said they observed the junction from 6 am to 10 pm and received an honorarium for the job. They would take up the survey at Kurupam Towers near Waltair bus stop on Wednesday, he said.
