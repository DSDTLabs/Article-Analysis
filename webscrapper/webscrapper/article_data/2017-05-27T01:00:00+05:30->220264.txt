 Members Gunjan, Neelam and Jyoti's power packed performance in the plays made a few among the guests teary eyed. After some serious acts, it was party time for the ladies who played games like dumb charades, antakshari and passing the parcel. While Shruti and Ekta were delighted to win the antakshari,   and Rekha were elated on being declared winners in dumb charades.
 Rachna and Renu were busy clicking selfies and we also spotted Neha, Anshu, Shalini and Payal having loads of fun.
