 is on a roll, what with her upcoming Hindi film ‘Aiyaary’ gearing up for release on February 9, 2018. 

  However, apart from that, something else, or rather someone else seems to be making the beautiful lass happy. The actress can’t stop gushing about the ‘wow feeling’ one gets when none other than   decided to follow her on social media. She shared on her social media, “Can't express my feelings when an alert stating @SrBachchan follows u back popped up. Thanku sir. Such a wow feeling . #fanforever” (sic)
 
  A quick check of Sr. Bachchan’s social media page reveals that not only did he in fact follow her; he also follows several other stars from the   on social media. Allari Naresh, Nikhil, Nithiin,   Akkineni, Naga Chaitanya,  , Vennela Kishore, Sundeep Kishan,  , Pranitha Subhash, Regina Cassandra,  ,  , Tamannah and Varun Tej are few of the many stars from TFI he seems to be following back. 
 
  While many congratulate Rakul in the comments section of her post and revel in her happiness, some wonder if Sr. Bachchan’s account has been hacked because he seems to be following an awful lot of artistes from the south industry. However, despite recently threatening to quit social media, Sr. Bachchan seems to be on roll as usual with his posts. As to what spurred on this ‘follow back’ spree of his of south Indian stars, only he can tell!
