JAIPUR: Rebel   will approach the   over his demand that the present residence of the   be earmarked as the official residence of the chief minister.

 A day after he met   with a request that the latter should not sign the   (second amendment) Bill-2017, Tiwari on Saturday said that he would meet the Lokayukta on Monday. 
 
 “As the chief minister is occupying 13, Civil Lines and the official CM residence – 8, Civil Lines – is being used as a guest house, the official residential address of the CM should be 13, Civil Lines from now on,’’ said Tiwari, who is also going to forward a memorandum to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). 
 
 Tiwari, who is facing charges of anti-party activities, has alleged that the bill, recently passed in the Rajasthan Assembly, was an attempt by the CM to continue occupying her present residence for life. He estimated the value of the state property to be Rs 2,000 crore. Tiwari has been vocal against the state leadership and launched the `Deendayal Vahini’ to fight corruption. 
 
 The senior BJP MLA stands sidelined within the party. He was denied both - a berth in the state cabinet and a position in the party. Meanwhile, he travelled the state gathering support for his fight against corruption. Tiwari was issued a notice for anti-party activities by the party’s central disciplinary committee, to which he has to reply within 10 days.
 
 Confirming that he has received the notice, Tiwari said that he is presently preparing his detailed reply to the notice. The notice seeks explanation from him over launch of a parallel party, not attending party meetings and making statements against the party. ``As different allegations are made against me in the notice, I will be sending the reply in different parts,’’ said Tiwari, who has claimed that he never talked or acted against the party.
