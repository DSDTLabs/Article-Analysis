CHANDIGARH: In a suspected case of honour killing, a 17-year-old girl was allegedly killed by her father and uncle on Friday for eloping with a boy from the minority community.

 Police have arrested the girl’s father   and uncle   for electrocuting her and then quietly cremating her in Haryana’s   district. The two were produced before the duty magistrate on Saturday and sent to a day’s police remand.
 
 Matlauda DSP Bali Singh, who is the supervising officer of the case, said the girl had eloped with a boy to   town in UP’s Shamli district. Police said her parents did not lodge any complaint and managed to bring her back within a week, following which they killed her.
 
 “Suresh and Shyam gagged the girl and used a high voltage cable to electrocute her. We came to know about her death on Friday morning but the family had cremated her before our team could reach the village,” an officer said, adding that forensic experts have collected samples for DNA examination.
