NAGPUR: Nagpur Municipal Corporation had directed Vansh Nimay Infraprojects Ltd (the earlier city bus operator) to pay minimum   to its drivers and conductors on April 25, 2016. In 2017, NMC scrapped VNIL’s contract. 

 NMC was caught on the wrong foot as it issued no such directive to present operators —   (DIMTS), Travel Time Car Rental Private Ltd , RK City Bus Operation Pvt Ltd, Smart City Bus Services Pvt Ltd and Scania Vehicles Pvt Ltd. 
 
 Instead, NMC transport department headed by transport manager   asked the resident team them to take legal action against those who participate in the strike asking for minimum wages. Drivers and conductors have threatened to go on strike from February 20 over low wages being paid to them.
 
 A delegation of drivers and conductors, under the leadership of former MP and district president  , met municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal and urged him to ensure drivers and conductors were paid minimum wages.
 
 Referring to a letter from additional labour commissioner to NMC on March 19, 2016, Jadhav stated the civic body had then written to VNIL to pay minimum wages to drivers and conductors. “Other private contractors like Kanak Resources engaged by the NMC were paying minimum wages to their workers, the three red bus operators and two conductors’ agencies are not doing so,” he said. Mudgal assured to look into the matter. 
 
 Meanwhile, NMC transport committee chairman Bunty Kukde held a meeting of operators to discuss the strike call given by drivers and conductors. “I have instructed them to ensure buses do not go off roads,” Kukde told TOI. In the meeting, operators claimed they have been paying wages as per Motor Vehicles Act and hence there was no violation of Minimum Wages Act. 
 
 When pointed out there was no mention of wages in Motor Vehicles Act, Kukde said he had already asked the operators’ to pay minimum wages.
