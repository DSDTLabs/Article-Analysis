GURUGRAM: The house of former   of Gadoli Khurd village, Mange Ram, was robbed in the wee hours of Sunday.   and   worth lakhs were   by a group of five men.

 According to police, the five accused climbed the rear wall of the house and entered through the back door.
 
  “All the jewellery, including heirloom jewellery belonging to my mother, my wife and my brothers’ wives, is missing. Five cupboards and their lockers were broken, while four trunks also kept in the room were ransacked,” said Harish Swami, Mange Ram’s son. In all, 86 tolas (around 1 kg) of gold jewellery and 1 kg of silver items were missing from the house, along with Rs 5 lakh in cash.
 
 According to cops, there were around 15 people in the house, including children, at the time of the robbery, but no one heard a thing until the thieves had fled with the loot. 
 
 According to Swami, cops arrived only an hour after they were called, at 4.30am. 
 
  Swami said they did not suspect anyone, as the family did not have any domestic helps. But cops suspect, labourers who worked in the house could have figured out where the cupboards and lockers were, and tipped-off someone.
 
 ASI Anil Kumar, the investigating officer, said police has recovered CCTV footage, but since it was recorded at night, there is not much clarity. He said the accused couldn’t be identified as their faces were hidden. “It’s not clear if the thieves came on foot or by car,” he said. 
 
 An FIR was registered under sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 380 (theft) and 457 (house trespass) of IPC at Sector 10A police station on Sunday
