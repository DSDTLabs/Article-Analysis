Actor Gaurav   is currently portraying the character of   in the show   and the actor is sporting a new look for the character.
 
  When asked about the new look,   says,"The character demanded someone who looks raw and has brutal power so we purposely did not want a lean gym physique and   decided that he want him to look realistic that when he fights with five people it should look like that he is fighting and beating them. I had to bulk up my body weight and started getting that look which is suitable for a warrior like Virendra and I am happy people are liking it."
  
  Gaurav also adds,"This is my first costume drama ever and I think this is the biggest show on television right now and one of the biggest show in my career. The reviews I am getting for the first two episodes are amazing, people did not recognize me and they were very surprised by the fact that I am looking very different in the show. I grew my beard, changed my voice and they see a new   in this I am very happy and I am getting a very positive feedback for the show." But how different is to work in a costume drama?
  
  Gaurav says," I think it's not easy to be a part of the costume drama because there is so much to take care of. As an actor you are wearing an armour, swords, wig and riding horses and jumping from heights and rolling on the ground and also acting so yes it’s not an easy task. It’s a tedious process to get ready but then the end result is amazing. Of course, the show has a lot of VFX and special effects and you are working on the chroma floor where you don’t know what the creative guys are going to put behind you so you have to imagine it by yourself in your own mind and act accordingly. There are lot of technicalities but yes that’s the fun and I am happy working and learning a new craft."
