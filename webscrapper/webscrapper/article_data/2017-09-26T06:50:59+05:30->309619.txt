CHANDIGARH: Struggling for the release of around Rs 1,200 crore pending   amount meant for meritorious Scheduled Caste (SC) students for the academic year 2015-16 and 2016-17, as many as 3,606 colleges and technical institutes in Punjab will have to wait till November.

 State welfare minister   told TOI, "I have taken up the issue with the Union government. After a complete audit of all institutes and getting utility certificates of the released amount, the Centre will release the pending dues." He added that it would take at least 20 days to complete the audit.
 
 The minister added, "All this has happened since there was no accountability of the post-matric scholarship amount during the last 10 years of the SAD-BJP rule in the state."
 Though the state government has received Rs 115.73 crore from the Centre in May for the academic year 2015-16, the amount would be released only after completion of the audit.
 
 It was in December last year that the state government had submitted Rs 661.64 crore scholarship claim to the Union government for the academic year 2015-16 and Rs 780.31 crore for 2016-17. The Punjab government also has a committed liability of Rs 60.79 crore per annum under the centrally sponsored post-matric scholarship.
 
 The state is yet to receive 50% of the post-matric scholarship amount from the Centre for the academic year 2015-16 and the complete amount for 2016-17 with regard to around 2.5 lakh students, said welfare department director Malwinder Singh Jaggi.
 
 It was in September 2015 that the multi-crore scam in the post-matric scholarship had come to fore wherein many technical institutions were found to have made dummy admissions of Scheduled Caste students during the 2014-15 academic session to usurp the scholarship amount. The issue had rocked the state assembly last year when then   had revealed that 5,925 students in polytechnics had fraudulently received scholarships amounting to Rs 18.06 crore and 201 students in various ITIs got around Rs 27.10 lakh.
 
 After coming to power, Captain   had ordered audit of all 3,606 colleges.
 
 The joint action committee comprising 13 associations of various colleges had raised the issue that the delay in release of scholarship amount would result in non-payment of salaries to staff and ultimately students would be devoid of quality education. Anshu Kataria, president of the Punjab Unaided Colleges Association (PUCA), told TOI, "The welfare minister had last week assured us release of the amount after completion of audit and we are cooperating with the government."
 
 According to  , the state government should release at least some amount pending audit to meet expenses of colleges since as per the RBI guidelines if a college failed to pay loan to the bank within 90 days, it is declared a non-performing asset.
