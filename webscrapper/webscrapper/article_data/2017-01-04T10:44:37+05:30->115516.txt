LUCKNOW: It was the first meeting between the father and the son after   was anointed as SP national president, replacing   Singh Yadav, at a special convention in Lucknow two days ago. While there was no confirmation whether they discussed any peace formula, sources close to Mulayam told TOI that Akhilesh explained his position and the turn of events which led to his elevation as the party’s national chief.

 “He said that by mustering the support of 220 MLAs on December 31 and then by proving majority support of the delegates at the emergency session of the party on January 1, he has proved his popularity both among the legislators and the cadre. So he (Mulayam) should have no objection to his take-over,” an insider told TOI.
 
 Whatever decisions he has taken in the past three-four days are to save the party and win the elections, Akhilesh reportedly tried to convince Mulayam by saying this. If the candidates with tainted image are being denied tickets, it is in the interest of the party, he reportedly told Mulayam.
 
 During the meeting, Mulayam, who has been keeping unwell, reportedly objected to the manner he was being marginalized and “Ram Gopal   hijacked the party”. He also tried to convince his son how he was being misled by Ram Gopal.
 
 Akhilesh went to meet Mulayam at his 5 Vikramaditya Marg residence around 1.10pm and remained there for more than three hours. In between, Shivpal, who returned from Delhi in the afternoon, joined them. While Akhilesh came out of Mulayam’s house around 4.15pm, Shivpal remained there and the two brothers had food together. They postponed all the other engagements of the day and stayed together till late evening.
