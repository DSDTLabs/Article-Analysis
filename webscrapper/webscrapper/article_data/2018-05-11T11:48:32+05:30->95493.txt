PANAJI:   that are yet to wind up business for the season were reportedly unaffected by Thursday night’s thunderstorm. With the closure deadline of May 31 nearing, over 80% of the shacks have shut down for the season. 

 President of the Shack Owners Welfare Society (SOWS) Cruz Cardozo said that some shacks are still operational at a few beach stretches that witness domestic footfalls throughout May.
 
 “No losses have been reported,”Cardozo told TOI.
 
 He also said that there are only four shacks operating on the   beach belt. 
 
 “As many as 17 shacks are set up along this stretch. Except for four, some shacks were dismantled last month, and a few this week as the season is drawing to a close,” he said.
 
 For shack operators at   and Colva, it was business as usual as domestic tourists were seen frolicking the beach despite the pre-monsoon showers.
 
 SOWS secretary John Lobo said that shacks are in operation only at the main beach stretches of Calangute, Baga and Candolim.
 
 After the experience of the Ockhi cyclone and rise in sea water level this season, Lobo said that operators are now better prepared to face any kind of eventuality. 
 
 “Most of the shacks are built using steady material. Plastic as well as palm leaves are used as a precaution against unexpected rainfall,” said Lobo.
 
 A shack operator in   said that though they make use of sturdy material to erect the shacks, there is no guarantee that the structures could withstand nature’s fury.
 
 Director of tourism department Menino D’Souza said that they have not received reports of any kind of losses suffered by shack operators.
