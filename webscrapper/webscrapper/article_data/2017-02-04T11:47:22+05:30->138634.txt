SURAT: Thieves diverted the attention of a driver of a car parked on   and escaped with a bag containing Rs 92,000 kept in the vehicle here on Thursday. 

 Sunish Shah, 44, a resident of Athwalines, who is a builder, had gone to a mega store near   with his family. He asked his driver to park the car nearby while leaving the bag containing cash on the front seat. 
 
 Soon, a man approached the driver saying that there was some money lying on ground. The driver got down to check when another man standing at the other side of the car lifted the bag after opening its door. Both the men escaped before the driver returned to his seat and realized what had happened.
 
 The burglars struck around 12 noon and that too in a crowded area of the city. “We are collecting details from those present at the spot to identify the suspects. So far we have not been able to identify anyone,” said a police officer. 
 
 Police are examining   collected from the area, but had no success so far.
