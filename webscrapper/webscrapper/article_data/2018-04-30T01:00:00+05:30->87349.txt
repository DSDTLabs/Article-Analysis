Over the years, many aspects of the dreaded 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks have been written about. But what is relatively unknown is the story of how British-born Pakistani terrorist Omar Saeed Sheikh escalated the tension between the two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan, with hoax phone calls. In his upcoming film Omertà, director Hansal Mehta chronicles the life of this terrorist.

 Soon after 26/11, reports in the Pakistani media claimed that Sheikh attempted to call the then Minister of External Affairs of India, Pranab Mukherjee, pretending to be Asif Ali Zardari, who was the President of Pakistan at that time. Pakistani media reports from that period suggest that Omar used a UK-registered SIM from inside his cell in Pakistan’s Hyderabad Central Jail, without the jail authorities being aware of it. However, the call was never passed on to Pranab Mukherjee by the operators who ran verification checks, and that’s when Sheikh decided to call the Pakistani establishment. This time around, he pretended to be Pranab Mukherjee and made threatening calls to   and Pakistan’s Army Chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, in a bid to heighten the tension between Pakistan and India. He also reportedly attempted to speak to the US Secretary of State.
 
 Omertà, which has been shot in real locations across London and India, exposes the real and present danger of Pakistan-sponsored terror. The gripping thriller is woven around terror strikes like 9/11, the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, and the brutal beheading of American journalist  . Written by Hansal Mehta and  , the film also features Timothy Ryan Hickernell, Kewal Arora, Rajesh Tailang and Mo Pitz among others.
