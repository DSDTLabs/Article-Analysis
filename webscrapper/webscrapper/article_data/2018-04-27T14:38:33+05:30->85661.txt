Despite the promise of veteran comedian   featuring in a major role in the the latest Vishnu Manchu-starrer '
 ,' which released in theatres today, a shoddy screenplay and cliched narrative makes watching this film an ordeal.

 A band of Pandits headed by Appalacharya (Brahmanandam) and his lieutenant   ( ) perform homam, a sacred ritual, at the house of a well-known family. Very quickly, they realise that some members of this household are extremely dangerous. A journalist is thrashed for writing a negative piece on one of them. And when the senior most member of the house dies due to the fire emanating from the homam, all hell breaks loose. Suddenly, the family members along with their band of goons blame the pandits for the death of their father. To escape them, they flee to America. However, itâ€™s not long before Appalacharya realises that the reason for them going to   was completely different.
 
 With amateurish writing, the first half turns out to be an absolute bore. Even the humour, which one expected to be the highlight of this film, turned out to be loud and lame. With an unimaginative script and a lacklustre screenplay,   turns out to be utterly disappointing so far. We wonder if the second half can salvage this film, it will take something special to do so.
