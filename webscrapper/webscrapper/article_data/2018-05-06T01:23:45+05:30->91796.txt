NEW DELHI: A   at St Stephen’s   of Delhi University and the tomb of its founder were reportedly vandalised by some miscreants on Thursday night. Photos were being circulated on the social media but no police complaint has been filed. A few teachers and students, who did not wish to be identified, had confirmed the incident but police sources said the college had denied any such thing had happened.

 According to students, the alleged   probably took place in the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. “We got up in the morning on Friday and saw some writing on the cross of the founder’s tomb and the door of the chapel,” a student told TOI. Scribbled across the door in black was “mandir yahin banega” (a temple will be constructed here) while the cross on the founder’s tomb had the Hindu religious symbol, Om, inscribed on it with the message: “I’m going to hell” in black.
 
 Some students claimed that there are CCTV cameras pointed at the founder’s tomb and chapel door and it would not be difficult to identify the culprit. No one from the college was available for comment. 
 
 A source told TOI that the offending words were removed by the college authorities on Saturday.
 
 Even as some Stephen’s alumni criticised the act, NSUI came out with a strong statement. Blaming “right-wing elements” in the campus, NSUI said “both slogans show the utterly disgusting mentality of the person or persons involved in the defacement of structures inside the college premises.” NSUI accused forces in the campus of trying to “polarise the student community on the basis of religion and fake nationalism” and called for an inquiry.
 
 ABVP’s Delhi unit head, Bharat Khatana, said if such an act had been committed, the “college must take action and check CCTV footage to verify the culprits.”
