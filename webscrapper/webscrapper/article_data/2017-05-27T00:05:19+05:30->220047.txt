Actor-director Pawan Kumarâ€™s solo show,  , brought him back to the stage after a decade. Bengalureans made a beeline to see the filmmaker return to acting and we caught many of his pals from the industry hurrying in for front row seats.The last time Pawan performed this show was on a New Year's Eve at the same venue,  , reminisced some of his friends who had come to see the latest show. We saw actors Sudha Belawadi, Samyukta Hornad,   and Radhika Chetan among many others who came for the show.
