When the teaser of the film   was released more than a year ago, it was hailed for its innovative content and sleek and smart presentation. However, it did not turn out to be viral hit that director-actor MG Srinivas expected it to be.

 Weeks before release, its theatrical trailer has turned out to be one of the most watched trailers in   in the last few days.And just like some of the recent `hit' film trailers like those of Eradane Sala, Smile Please and  , it was the double entendres in the dialogues that has propelled Srinivasa Kalyana's popularity. It has also draw criticism by fans for being too `vulgar'.
 
 Srinivas, who made his debut as director with  's  , says perspectives will change. 'In the last few years, use of cuss words has become the norm in Hindi films. It used to shock people in the beginning, but not anymore. The same is happening in Kannada. I accept that some people have criticised the trailer, but I do not accept there is anything vulgar.
 
 But a much bigger number of people have also liked it. Especially among the youth, it is a big hit,' he said. Srinivas also says that he had to draw attention to his film.
 
 'I promise that it is a fun film that can be enjoyed by the entire family.I am trying to tell a philosophical point of view of romance. But I have to keep it commercially entertaining.I do not want to do a preaching job in the film. I had to draw attention to the film in the crowded market. It may not work all the time. But the film will connect with everyone. I am sure of that,' he said.
