Chandigarh: In the 10-year-old’s   case, the Chandigarh district court allowed UT police’s application to reconduct DNA test of the first maternal uncle, whose report had earlier not matched with the newborn. The court issued notice to the DNA experts for Friday for taking samples.

 The defence counsel had contested this, saying the police were given permission for further investigation and not reinvestigation. The court, however, observed that it was part of further investigation. “The police want to take second opinion on DNA report of the first maternal uncle, and so the sample will be sent to another laboratory,” sources in the police said. The police had also arrested the second maternal uncle of the survivor after she gave a statement in the court that he had also raped her several times. The police have taken DNA samples of the second accused too and sent those to CFSL. 
 
 The case had hit headlines in July after the Supreme Court had dismissed the plea, seeking termination of survivor’s 32-week pregnancy after taking medical opinion. On August 17, the survivor gave birth to a baby girl, who is being looked after by the state.
