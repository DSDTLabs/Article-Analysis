PANAJI: A decade on, the electricity department has begun accepting cash payments up to Rs 5,000 against power bills at its subdivision offices. Prior to this, counters at subdivision offices were permitted to accept cash up to Rs 500. 

 While there was no tariff hike for 2017-18, the department has proposed an increase for 2018-19 to bridge a part of the revenue deficit of Rs 73 crore. Poor management of manpower has resulted in the government having to meet a large chunk of the proposed revenue gap of Rs 394 crore through budgetary support.
 
 The department set up the state load dispatch centre at   to help the department schedule its power consumption more accurately, saving crores of rupees it has been paying on penalties. 
 
 Replacement of LED lights under the Prime Minister’s Street Light National Programme is yet to be completed in the state. Underground cabling is under way as is aerial bunching of cables which is expected to reduce power outages. The first rooftop solar power plant was connected to the electricity grid in May and the state also notified a solar policy for the state. 
 
 “A lot of work was completed this year,” state power minister   told TOI.
