DEHRADUN: After multiple rounds of talks and assurance by chief minister  , 3,000 agitating workers of the   have called off their strike which ran into 11 days and brought garbage collection in the city to a complete halt. The municipal corporation on Friday claimed that it would clean 90% of the city by the end of the day as employees had reported to duty. However, heaps of garbage were still visible in many parts of the city late on Friday night.
 
  The strike was called off on Thursday after the CM promised the workers that their wages would be increased from Rs 166 to Rs 275 per day and that sacked workers would be reinstated. The workers had been demanding salary on a par with the minimum wages in the state.
  
  Vishal Kumar, a sanitation worker, said, “The strike was called off on Thursday night after the CM asked officials to issue a government order for increase in our wages which will benefit our monthly income by approximately Rs 3,000. We are happy that our long standing demand has been fulfilled.”
  
   , sanitation officer, DMC told TOI, “Most of the workers reported to duty on Friday. We are hopeful of the situation returning to normal in a few days.” Residents, however, said that this would be a mammoth task looking at the piles of garbage that had accumulated in nearly two weeks of the strike.
  
   , president, Doon Residents’ Welfare Front, said, “It will take some time for the city to be clean again. The workers have started lifting garbage from areas like   and EC Road.”
