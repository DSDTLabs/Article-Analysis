UNNAO: Not too long ago, Awdhesh Kumar of   village, Lucknow district, was a worried man. A farmer with an annual income of just Rs 1 lakh, he found it tough to run the household and manage his children’s education of his children. But what really gave him sleepless nights was the thought of getting his daughter married — a particularly difficult task in a region where one’s “status” is closely linked to their prospective matches. Then, something happened. 

 In 2013, it came to light that the 302km   announced by the chief minister would pass through the agricultural fields of several Reveri farmers, including Awdhesh’s. The project brought a sudden windfall for the farmers, all of whom got 5-10 times the actual market value of their land. 
 
 The government paid lucrative compensation to farmers that went up to Rs 50 lakh per bigha, and the farmers suddenly found new nuptial possibilities open up for their families.
 
 “In a tiny village like Reveri, marrying one’s daughter into a big farmer’s family is a huge honour. The compensation helped me match the status of the groom’s side and change my daughter’s fortune forever. I gifted my daughter a four-wheeler, which is the most expensive wedding gift in my village to date,” said Awdhesh. 
 
 The villagers’ uplifted   is reflected in their improved  , especially the  . 
 
 It was the pucca house dairy owner Mohd Anees built in Baratikheda village that helped him find a bride for his son. “We spent our entire life in a kuchcha house. But as soon as we got the compensation, I built a pucca house. Suddenly, there was a deluge of proposals.” The money has also helped many youths begin independent businesses, and reduced the dependence on agriculture for livelihood. 
 
 Besides this, many far-off villages are now a lot more accessible.
