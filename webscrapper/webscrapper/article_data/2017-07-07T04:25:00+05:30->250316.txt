Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Thursday issued a notice to deposed acharya of Vadtal seat of Swaminarayan sect, Ajendraprasad Pande, over a petition demanding cancellation of his bail granted by the city sessions court in August last year.

 Justice Sonia Gokani admitted the bail cancellation petition filed by one Dharmpriyadasji Guru and posted further hearing on July 17. Earlier, two judges – Justice A Y Kogje and Justice G R Udhwani – recused themselves from this case.
 
 The high court has also sought Pande’s reply over plea for cancellation of bail granted to him by a Nadiad court on August 10, 2016.
 
 The case pertains to circulation of controversial sex CD. Pande is accused of immoral trafficking, conspiracy, spreading hatred among people and deliberately outraging feelings of people by circulating the sex CD showing sadhus of his rival section in compromising position. He and his supporters were even accused of getting sexual act of rival sadhus on tape by supplying women to them.
 
 The demand of bail cancellation was raised on the ground that though the courts had issued warrant against Pande under section 70 of the CrPC and he remained wanted for 11 years, the courts granted bail to him on the day he surrendered before the courts.
 
 The petitioner has also submitted that when Pande surrendered before the courts, the state government did not seek his remand. The prosecution also did not raise any objection against Pande’s bail applications.
 
 This scandal was believed to be an outcome of the fierce rivalry between Pande and Nautam Swami. Pande was voted out of the Vadtal board by the rival group and was deposed after a high court order. The FIRs were filed at two places – Ahmedabad crime branch and Chaklasi police station in Kheda in 2005.
