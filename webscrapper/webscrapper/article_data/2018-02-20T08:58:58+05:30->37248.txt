CHENNAI: From being a ‘Sandiyar’ (troublemaker) to becoming a ‘Nammavar’ (our man), actor   seems to have come a long way, as he gears up for his political party’s launch on Wednesday. One thing that remains common is Madurai.

 At the height of the controversy over naming one of his films ‘Sandiyar’, Kamal Haasan preferred a public function in Madurai to launch the film rechristened ‘Virumaandi’ in 2003. While the film’s story revolved around the southern region, the actor also wanted to send out a strong message to his opponents about the troubles he had to undergo. Nearly 15 years later, he has again chosen Madurai as the venue to unveil his party name and flag, as he sets upon his political journey.
 
 
 Of course, with his family origins well entrenched in Paramakudi in nearby Ramanathapuram district, Madurai naturally happens to be the hub closest to his heart. But, for a man who has used the ‘Madras slang’ of Tamil more in films, the choice of Madurai is a tad surprising.
 
 “If one considers Tamil Nadu’s political history in the 20th century, whether it is the Justice Party or Dravidar Kazhagam or even DMK, Muslim League or Home Rule party, all these were founded in Chennai. While Southern   had led the North in terms of contribution towards culture and arts, people over there are also emotionally charged. That’s one reason both MGR and Jayalalithaa had a soft corner for Madurai and nearby regions,” says Dravidian historian K Thirunavukkarasu.
 
 “Sentimentally, Madurai was the base for MGR, who ruled the Tamil film industry for decades. A grand function to mark the success of his ‘Nadodi Mannan’ was held in Madurai,” feels senior journalist Sudhangan.
 
 “Madurai is also close to the heart of the film industry, with number of film fans and fanatics being based here,” he said, while adding that MGR himself had contested from Madurai West in the 1980 assembly election, following the dismissal of his government.
