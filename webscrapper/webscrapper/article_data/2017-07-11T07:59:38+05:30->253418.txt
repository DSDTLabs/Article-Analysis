 This year, the   will be celebrated between August 20 and 27, although there will be events — from exhibitions to food festivals and heritage walks and talks — across the city all through the month. “Last year saw enthusiastic city-wide celebrations,” said S Muthiah, the city’s most well-known chronicler, adding the event is completely volunteer-driven. He also said the Madras high court will be the highlight this year.
 
 The Madras Week celebrations began 14 years ago as a day-long festival marking founding of the city on August 22, 1639, but over the years, the festivities have lasted up to September. At a press conference on Monday, the organisers called for individuals and institutions to join in to celebrate the city.
 
 For the first time, Captain D P Ramachandran — veteran of the 1971 Indo-Pak war and a specialist on the military heritage of the city — and his team of retired officers of the  , are planning a programme involving services units in the city.
 
 Those interested can log on to www.themadrasday.in or the app Madras Week. A booklet with programmes will also be distributed closer to the date of the event by   (www.madrasmusings.com).
