SHIMLA: A massive cleanliness, protection and  , perhaps the first of its kind on this scale, was launched along the Kalka-Shimla railway track. Governor Acharya Devvrat and Acting Chief Justice Sanjay Karol were among the approximately 15,000 volunteers, including students, members of civil society, organizations like the Indian Railways, Territorial Army, panchayats, various wings of Himachal government, civil defence, NGOs who participated in this drive.

 Acharya Devvrat inaugurated the drive organised under the aegis of HP State Legal Services Authority from Baba Bhalku Museum here on Saturday. Addressing more than 1,000 students and participants at the main railway station, Shimla, Acharya Devvrat called upon students to become brand ambassador for cleanliness.
 
 The drive began simultaneously across 43 different segments that had been identified all along the 96km track from Shimla to Kalka. During the campaign 3,000 trees were also planted. The drive will be followed by maintenance and forestation that will be conducted by Himachal ‘eco-warriors’ and the Territorial Army. Impact assessments and a follow-up have also been planned following this initial measure.
