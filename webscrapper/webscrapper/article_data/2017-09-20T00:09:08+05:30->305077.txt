Bhopal: Things look grim for next summer. As many as 45 of the 51 districts are rainfall deficient, and with monsoon on its last legs, it’s unlikely the shortfall will be made up.

 It looks certain that the state is headed for a water crisis next summer that will affect farmers and city dwellers alike. As of Tuesday, only six districts are rain-surplus. In some places, the shortfall is close to an alarming 50%. Eastern Madhya Pradesh is the worst affected — not a single district has got its quota. In the last two days, parts of the state received strong showers, but it too little, too late, say officials. 
 
 On September 19, Madhya Pradesh was 24% rain deficient. This is a sharp drop from August figures when the state was 13% rain deficient and 35 districts had received less rainfall. 
 
 State government officials say they are well aware of the situation and have assured necessary measures to deal with a probable drought-like situation.
 
 The Met department admits that the deficit won’t be recovered. However, it has forecast a few good spells of rainfall before monsoon draws to a close in the state.
 
 According to the Met department’s rainfall data, the districts that have received more than normal rainfall are Burhanpur, Indore, Jhabua, Khandwa, Neemuch and Ratlam. The worst-affected districts are Balaghat, Damoh, Narsinghpur, Shahdol, Tikamgarh, Umaria, Bhind, Datia, Gwalior, Harda, Morena, Sehore, Sheopur, and Vidisha.
 
 This year, the state has received 693.1mm rain so far — well short of the expected annual average of 918.5mm.
