THANE: The   at   that was inaugurated on Monday has now been thrown open to public. It will cater to commuters round-the-clock and provide   at a discounted rate. 

 “The pharmacy has been facilitated for the commuters. We have all kinds of medicines, including pharmaceutical drugs for diabetes, hypertension and also HIV, etc. The medicines will be sold at a discount of 10 to 20 per cent against the MRP. The pharmacy will be open 24x7 so that people can buy medicines even in the night during emergencies,” said Dr Rahul Ghule, CEO of the Re 1 clinic (Emergency Medical Room) at Thane station. 
 
 The Re 1 clinic has been operational for almost six months. It caters to railway accident victims and also regular commuters. Earlier, the center could not provide a few tablets as they did not have enough space to keep the stock, so now they have started a pharmacy which will have tablets, syrups, injections, etc for almost all ailments.
 
 The centre is located just besides the Re 1 clinic at platform number two. Earlier, as the Emergency Medical Room did not have medicines for all the diseases, people had to buy them from other chemists with the prescription given by the doctor at the clinic. The clinic caters to over 100 commuters daily and has three doctors and two nurses.
 
 The pharmacy will have adequate staff to assist the citizens regarding the medicines, if they require any help.
 
 “We have allocated a staff at the centre who will give out necessary medicines for various ailments. There are four pharmacists and six salesmen currently working at the pharmacy. Also, along with other general tests and scans that are done at our clinic, we will even be doing HIV tests,” added Dr Ghule.
