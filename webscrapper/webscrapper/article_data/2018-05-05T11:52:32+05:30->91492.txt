AUCKLAND: Indian shutter B   went down fighting to second seed   of Indonesia in the men's singles semi-finals of the   Open on Saturday.

 
 The 25-year-old   was the lone Indian left in fray in the tournament.
 
 However, his run came to an end after he succumbed to a 14-21, 21-19, 21-8 loss in a match that lasted over an hour.
 
 The Indian, who was seeded third for this tournament, won the first game comfortably and was leading the second game for a while.
 
 But Christie fought back, eventually winning two straight points when the score was tied at 19-19 to win the second game and force the match into a deciding third game.
 
 Praneeth struggled to compete against his Indonesian rival in the third game, as Christie dominated it to enter the final.
 
 On Friday, Praneeth hardly broke a sweat as he took just 28 minutes to quell the challenge of Sri Lanka's   21-7, 21-9 in the quarterfinals.
 
 In the title clash, Christie will face the winner of the other semi-final between China's   and South Korea's Heo Kwang Hee.
