Colva: With an aim to improve the crime detection rate in the state, the government seeks to open more police stations which will in turn reduce the load on the existing infrastructure, chief minister Manohar Parrikar said on Saturday.

 He was speaking at the inauguration of the Fatorda police station, in the presence of the town and country planning minister and Fatorda MLA, Vijai Sardesai.
 
 With the new station, Parrikar said that Margao town police can now focus on detecting crimes and dig deeper into the reason for such criminal acts. He said that the government felt the need to have more police stations in view of the increase in tourist footfalls and rising crime graph. 
 
 The chief minister also said that patrolling and intelligence gathering were key in solving crimes. 
 
 “There is a need to curtail crime in the state. It is surprising that people can pull out a gun across the table and kill a friend,” he said, while referring to the recent murder incident in Rawanfond, Navelim. “Though the accused has been nabbed, a probe is required to ascertain from where the gun was procured,” he added. 
 
 Sardesai said that the setting up of a police station at Fatorda will give a sense of security to his constituents. He warned that any form of ‘goondagiri’ will not be tolerated henceforth. “Zero tolerance to goondagiri and drugs, as this government is for Goenkarponn,” he said.
