MUMBAI: Almost 75% of   who treat tuberculosis (TB) have started notifying cases to the government, said   officials on the occasion of World   Day on Friday. The notification process helps in keeping track of infectious patients.

 The city registered a 21% rise in the number of multi-drug-resistant TB cases in 2016, with 3,608 instances registered in 2015. BMC’s data shows 4,373 cases were registered in 2016. 
 
 “The rise in the number of MDR cases is due to strong referral from the private sector,” BMC’s chief TB officer Dr Daksha Shah told TOI. “BMC officials as well as our NGO partners have worked hard to achieve such a partnership,” said Dr Shah.
 
 The BMC is also carrying out an awareness programme that includes a campaign in which one crore SMSes on TB awareness will be sent to citizens. The SMSes will have a link to the “TB Harega, Desh Jeetega” YouTube channel. 
 
 BMC on Thursday released 2016 TB data, which showed that the epidemic is still growing. Not only was there a 21% rise in MDR cases, there was a 9% rise in the regular or drug-sensitive cases.
