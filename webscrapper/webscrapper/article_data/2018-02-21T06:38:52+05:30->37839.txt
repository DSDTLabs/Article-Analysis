KOLKATA: The   government will enact a law, making it a penal offence to allow water to stagnate near homes, which can breed mosquitoes.

 The government is set to introduce three bills in the state assembly, extending the regulation not just in Kolkata and  , but to the entire state.
 
 According to the draft bill, which is likely to be introduced in this February 19-March 7 assembly session, the owners or occupants found wanting may be slapped with a fine ranging from Rs 1000 to Rs 1lakh. If the area is outside   jurisdiction, the offenders will be charged a penalty of Rs 1000. The offenders will also be slapped a fine of Rs 50 per day daily from the day the notice is served.
 
 The penal provisions will only kick in if the the owners/ occupants had been warned before to clear out the stagnating water.
 
 The KMC and the other civic bodies will first ask the owners/occupants to clean and drain off the water. They will also be required to treat it chemically, or adopt other scientific methods suitable under the circumstances and even fill them up. This could be anywhere, inside or outside the premises. According to the municipal commissioner if these puddles, which breed mosquitoes or even be a reason of nuisance, are left unattended by the owner or occupier, a notice under section 496A (1) of the KMC Act, 1980 will be slapped.
 
 The notice will also extend to under-construction buildings. The notice slapped will have a timeframe and if the offender doesnâ€™t act within that, the civic bodies will intervene.
