The audio release function of the   and Ritu Varma-starrer   was an entertaining and fun event laden with humour, naach-gaana and some mischief. The Saturday night event saw attendance of the film’s team, which included Bollywood actress  , along with a bunch of celebrities like Gunasekhar,   and Sharwanand. Soon after the emcees kick-started the proceedings, it was time for actor Nikhil’s “surprise performance”. Though initially he acted oblivious of it, pretending he did not know about the performance, after a while the star was on the stage with back-up dancers for his act. Of all the speeches that were delivered on the night by various people associated with the film, it was comedian Vennela Kishore’s talk that stood out thanks to some funny anecdotes and expressions. It also elicited the maximum laughter from the gathering as he was engaged by Nikhil in a amusing conversation. After a funny banter between the two about who got more screen time on the film, the duo’s attention shifted towards Pelli Choopulu’s Priyadarshi, which ended with Nikhil saying, “Vaddu valla film ki National Award vachindi..,” evoking more laughs. The night drew to a close on a high following the performances of all three stars — Nikhil, Ritu and Isha — on the stage.
