AHMEDABAD: While granting admission to poor children under the   ( ) laws, authorities have sent a child to class 1 in a private school that is 25km from his home. The district education office received a complaint on Wednesday from Sanjay Rathod, a resident of Laxminagar Chawl near Ghoda Camp in Asarwa. Rathod said that his son had been given admission in a school in  . He urged the DEO to grant admission at a nearby school.

 While applying for admission in the 25% quota for poor children under the RTE Act, Rathod had picked three schools that fall near his house in Shahibaug as options — KSMM Primary School, Vinay Vidhya Mandir, and SMT GG-1 in Cantonment. However, Rathod’s son was given admission in Sanskar Vidhyalay in   of Hathijan. Rathod attached maps with his complaint.
 
 The RTE norms mandate that the school in which a child is admitted is in the 3km radius from the child’s home. “This mistake has taken place due to a technical issue in calculating distances with GPS,” Ahmedabad’s in-charge   said. “We have received 10 such complaints. We are forwarding these to the state education department. We hope that the mistakes will soon be corrected and the children will be given admission in other schools soon.” 
 
 The DEO’s office has also received three complaints about admission being granted in private schools that have been shut down. These defunct schools are in Gota, Thaltej, and Raipur.
