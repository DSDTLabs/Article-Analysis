NOIDA: The   (Meerut), Mahendra Dev, has directed   to admit the 45 students whose names were struck off the rolls by the school over fee payment after charging them the valid fee.

 In a notice dated April 6 — the fourth on the subject to the school in a year — Dev has said that striking off the names of the 45 students was not correct.
 
 “Through the letter dated March 24, you were directed to submit a report within a week but you have not submitted any so far. It has been brought to our notice by parents that you have not admitted the students who did not pay the fees, which is not correct. Hence, you are directed to give admission to the students after collecting valid fees,” the notice said.
 
 Indira Kohli, principal, DPS Sector 132, said the notice was the same as received earlier. “We had received such a notice earlier too. We have forwarded the same reply as earlier,” she said, adding that the parents of these students will have to pay the fee with a hike of 14% and the kids will be re-admitted.
 
 The parents, who have been resisting the “arbitrary” fee hike for almost a year now, called the move eyewash. Their reasoning was that no action has been taken against the school despite the authorities admitting that the school collected “annual charges”, which is in violation of the state government rules.
 
 “Four notices, no reply and still the   to the school is not cancelled,” said a parent whose child studies in Class V. 
 
 On June 29, 2016, the director had sent a notice to the school seeking details of the amount of “annual charges” collected by the school.
 
 “Please inform within a week along with evidence and clarify how much money has been collected by you class-wise as annual charges,” the notice had said. 
 
 The joint director did not respond to queries from TOI.
