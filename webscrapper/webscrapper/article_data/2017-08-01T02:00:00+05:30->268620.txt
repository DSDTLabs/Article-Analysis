PATNA: With monsoon at its peak,   cases are on the rise in the state. At least three dengue cases were confirmed at Patna Medical College and Hospital in July.

 “The peak period for dengue is August-November. In June, we had collected seven samples and none were tested positive for dengue. However, of the 22 samples tested in July, three were found positive for dengue,” said HoD of PMCH microbiology department Dr Umesh Sharma.
 
 Doctors said the number may further rise between August and September. “Dengue is a viral disease spread by Aedes mosquitoes that bites in daytime. As the dengue virus is mostly active during early morning and evening, special precautions should be taken during these times of the day. Tropical and sub-tropical areas are more prone to the disease, hence travelling from and to these regions should be avoided. People should wear clothes that fully cover the skin to avoid mosquito bites. Use of mosquito net and insect repellent ointments can also keep the disease at bay,” said a doctor.
