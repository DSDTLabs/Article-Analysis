 The pockets that faced water woes included parts of Jubilee Hills, Banjara Hills, Red Hills, Kukatpally, stray areas in Bahadurpura, Charminar, Aramgarh and a few parts of Narayanguda.
 
 “Our entire building had no water supply from Wednesday onwards. The maintenance in-charge had to ultimately call in tankers on Thursday to meet the requirements of those living in 12 flats,” said Arpit Desai, a resident of Khairatabad.
 
 Similarly,   from Kukatpally shared how he, along with his neighbours, turned to a private tanker owing to the acute shortage. “We hope that the authorities fix the problem soon as buying tankers is an expensive affair,” the IT professional said.
 
 Officials of the  , while confirming the problem, maintained that it stemmed from irregular power supply. “Delay in supplies is continuing and that’s because TSSPDCL authorities are yet to restore power in some bylanes of the city. When the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) verified on Thursday, it found that over 30% areas had not received supplies,” said a senior HMWS&SB official, hoping that the problem would be resolved by Friday. 
 
 “Though we have enough water in all the pumping stations to supply water to the entire city, supply was slightly disrupted due to power problem. By Friday, all areas will get enough water supply,” he said.
 
 Officials further claimed that general managers of all Operation and Maintenance (O&M) divisions had been alerted and asked to coordinate with TSSPDCL authorities to restore power and regularise water supply.
