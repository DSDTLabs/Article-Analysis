 Coimbatore: A 53-year-old vice-president of Tirupur north district BJP allegedly hanged himself from a branch of a neem tree near his house at Muthanampalayam in Tirupur on Friday. But his family claimed he was murdered by a gang which later staged the suicide by hanging.
 
 The deceased was identified as SP Muthu alias Marimuthu, 53, of Saraswathi Nagar at Muthanampalayam in Tirupur. He was running a banian label printing unit and had taken dealership of a branded banian company. 
 
 The culprits had put up a portrait of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a pole near the tree. The portrait was garlanded with slippers. A board with ‘TPR 12345’ written on it was also found in the vicinity, raising suspicions that some radical outfit might have murdered him.
 
 However, the Tirupur city police claim it is a suicide and they have registered a case under section 174 CrPC (suspicious death). Tension prevailed in the area after the death of the BJP functionary and many shops were closed.
 
 Marimuthu used to visit his shed at 4am daily to provide water for his cattle. Early Friday morning, he left the house and did not return for more than two hours. His wife Pushpa, 51, went to the farm and found her husband hanging from the branch of a neem tree near the cattle-shed.
