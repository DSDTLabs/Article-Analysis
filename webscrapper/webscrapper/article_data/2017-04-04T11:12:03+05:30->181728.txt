HYDERABAD: Students of   (Manuu) on Monday protested fee hike and threatened to go on a hunger strike if their demands were not met.The protest which was organised by the Manuu Students' Union saw the participation of about 200 students from all departments.

 “Almost all departments were closed today as students boycotted classes. We even took out a rally in the evening to show our dissent against UGC gazette and fee hike,“ said  , president, Manuu Students' Union. He said that the university must immediately take a decision to roll back seat cut and fee hike so students would not suffer.
 
  authorities dismissed the reports of the strike and claimed there was no boycott of classes. “The strength of the students in all classes is as normal as it should be on any given day in the summer,“ said  , vicechancellor, Manuu.
 
 Responding to reports that Manuu has increased its annual fee structure, VC said that there was no enhancement in fees for students who were already with the varsity. 
 
 “Following the directive from the UGC, the university has decided to make nominal enhancement in fee structure for scholars seeking admission into PhD and MPhil programmes beginning the academic year 2017-2018. The fee also includes Rs 200 examination fee. The increase does not apply to students who are already with the university from previous academic years,“ he said.
 
 “The hike in the fee for new admissions in research streams is between Rs 1,000 and 1,500 per annum from academic year,“ said the VC. Students said that it did not matter if fee hike was applicable to them or not and made it clear that they were fighting on behalf of all minority students. “Whosoever is at the receiving end, we are fighting for them. This is a minority college and fee hike would mean an additional burden on students,“ said Tajamul.
