VADODARA: Amongst other issues, the   (VMC) councillors raised the issue of water supply in the city during the general board meeting on Friday. The administration shared details of its plans to handle any possible water supply this summer.

 The elected representatives had expressed concern over water supply in the city due to the uncertainty of availability of water from the   project canal at Khanpur. VMC commissioner   told the board that the civic body was set to drill bores near water supply tanks to take care of any shortage. The civic body could also regulate water supply to handle the situation.
 
 The civic body has already brought out tenders for the drilling of bores. Also, sources said, supply of Narmada waters to the city may not be stopped completely.
