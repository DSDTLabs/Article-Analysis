Chandigarh: A former chief Justice of the Rajasthan high court, Justice S K Mittal, will be the new chairperson of Haryana Human Rights Commission. This was decided on Wednesday, by a committee comprising chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, assembly speaker Kanwar Pal and leader of opposition Abhay Singh Chautala.

 Justice Mittal, who has also served as a judge in the Punjab and Haryana high court before his elevation as chief justice of Rajasthan high court, is serving as the lokpal in Punjab. Sources said the decision to appoint Justice Mittal was unanimous.
 
 The post of chairperson was vacant since August 2016, when former chairperson Justice V K Jain had retired. Two posts of members of the commission are also lying vacant. A native of Narnaul in Mahendergarh district, Justice Mittal was elevated as a judge in the Punjab and Haryana high court in 2001.
