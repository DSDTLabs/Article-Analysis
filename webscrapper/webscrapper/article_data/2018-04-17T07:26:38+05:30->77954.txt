AHMEDABAD: Those who apply for passports have to go to the police station concerned after they get a call from an official for verification of their proof of residence and other documents.

 Now, with one application, the process has been reversed. A policeman will come to the applicant’s home equipped with the ‘Pocket Cop’ mobile application, click a photograph of the applicant, scan the proof of residence and other documents and feed the coordinates of the residence, all on a mobile phone. All the documents are then sent to the city CP or district SP office. A total of 2,100 police verifications have taken place in the pilot run in Ahmedabad and  .
 
 Gujarat CM   launched the application in Gandhinagar on Monday in the presence of MoS (home) Pradipsinh Jadeja, chief secretary J N Singh, ACS (home) M S Dagur and DGP Shivanand Jha. A total of 4,900 phones with the application will be given to personnel across the state in the first phase.
 
 Shamsher Singh, ADGP, SCRB, said that in the second phase, they intend to connect the state police’s Citizen Portal, adding 24 more to the existing four. “Our aim is to bring all policing-related activities to a single mobile platform that can be accessed by the officials at any time and from anywhere. We have built in adequate checks in the system to prevent misuse,” he said.
 
 Developed by Gujarat Police’s State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) in collaboration with an IT major, the application currently has four functions — verification for issue of passports, search of an accused, search for a vehicle and search for a missing person. For the last three purposes, the state police database has been integrated, so an official can access all FIRs filed since 2004, a database of 69 lakh accused persons and more than 14 lakh vehicles.
