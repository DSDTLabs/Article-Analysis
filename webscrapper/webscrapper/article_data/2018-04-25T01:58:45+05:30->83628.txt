NEW DELHI: Stuck for nearly nine  , the   Colony redevelopment   finally took off on Tuesday after housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri laid its foundation stone. Under the in situ redevelopment project, the plan is to make 14 towers of 14 storeys to house 2,800 families living in Kathputli   for nearly 40 years. The new houses are to be ready by February 2019. 

 Announced by the UPA government in 2009, the PPP project was stuck for years because the Delhi Development Authority and the slum-dwellers couldn’t arrive at a consensus on the eligibility criteria.
 
 The redevelopment project will be carried out by Raheja Developers and, in lieu of constructing the 2,800 EWS houses, the developer will be entitled to build and dispose of 170 freehold HIG flats and commercial built-up area equivalent to 10% of the EWS floor-area ratio on a leasehold basis.
 
 Apart from housing the slum-dwellers, the complex will have an exhibition museum to showcase the craft of Kathputli Colony residents who are primarily artisans. There will also be a multipurpose hall, a health centre, children’s play area, an amphitheatre, retail outlets, a police post, a religious site and a separate area for marriage ceremonies.
 
 Puri said unlike earlier government schemes of relocating slum-dwellers to far-flung locations, the in situ development would ensure that they could live in modernised housing complexes in the same area. He said the project would allay the fears of residents of getting displaced. “We are committed to providing facilities at unauthorised colonies and slums,” he said.
 
 LG Anil Baijal, who was also present during the ceremony, said the project had faced a lot of hurdles, but “this will be a model for other slums in the city. Land is scarce in Delhi and in situ development is the way ahead”.
