Bengaluru: Over a month after a decomposed body was found at a construction site in south Benglauru, investigation has revealed that the victim, Sahadev Rai, was allegedly killed for Rs 350. Three men — Sahadev’s co-workers at the site — were recently arrested from Jharkhand in connection with the murder. The accused bludgeoned Sahadev to death with a cement block, following an argument over the money he owed them. Rai’s body was found on April 1, almost four months after the murder. It was buried in construction debris at the site in Classic Orchid Layout, Puttenahalli. SD Sharanappa, deputy commissioner of police, south, said when investigation began, they had no clue about the victim’s identity, since the construction site had a large floating population of migrant workers. “We questioned over 100 people before we were told about Sahadev, a worker who had gone missing,” he said. The probe took police to Sahadev’s home state, Jharkhand. Cops got to know that some persons who were working with him in Bengaluru had also gone missing from the site. Police picked up Mangro Mahanta alias Mungudu 32, Gono Roy alias Ginnu, 42 and Byjyanath, 45, all natives of Jharkhand, who spilled the beans during interrogation. The trio and Sahadev had got into a drunken brawl over the money — Rs 350 — the latter owed them. As the argument heated up, they attacked him and crushed his face with the block, police said quoting the trio. The accused buried Sahadev’s body in the debris. But to their bad luck, it was discovered by some of the workers, who informed police.
