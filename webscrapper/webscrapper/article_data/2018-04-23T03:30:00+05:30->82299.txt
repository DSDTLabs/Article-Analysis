Panaji: The   of Bombay at Goa has directed that a petition challenging the government’s powers in delimiting and reserving wards for panchayat and municipal polls be put up on the final hearing board commencing from June 4, 2018.

 The division bench comprising Justice N M Jamdar and Justice Prithviraj K Chavan passed this order while disposing off The Mango Foundation’s (TMF) miscellaneous civil application (MCA) praying for an early disposal of their pending petition. 
 
 If this petition is decided, it would potentially usher in fair democracy, as Goa State Election Commission (GSEC), the empowered body, would carry out the process of delimiting and reserving wards without influence and manipulations of political parties, Wilbur Menezes, the petitioner’s advocate, submitted before the court recently. 
 
 The high court had admitted in February 2017, TMF’s public interest litigation (PIL) on the ground that the petition calls for proper examination of constitutional provisions and state laws as to who should carry out the process.
 
 The foundation had prayed in the PIL that the court strike down Section 7 of Goa Panchayat Act and Section 10 of Goa Municipalities Act as being unconstitutional. The election process being carried out by both departments – under the government’s control - is not free and fair, the petitioner had alleged. 
 
 After polls to Ponda and Sakhali civic bodies were announced, TMF filed the civil application amidst fresh allegations of foul play in ward reservation and petitions being filed in the court challenging the process. 
 
 The MCA was disposed off after advocate general, Dattaprasad Lawande and GSEC commissioner, S N Joshi agreed to a final disposal of the matter in June.
