Varanasi, it appears, is a favourite muse for  , an Australian artist, who held his third exhibition in the city, recently. The abstract painting exhibition, titled 'Agent Orange', had Lord Hanuman as the theme. "During my repeated stay in the city, I came across several temples but it was Lord Hanuman who most intrigued me as a deity. The deity is represented in different forms but what runs common are the eyes which are kind of observing everyone," said the artist.

 Interestingly, the exhibition was not just confined to delineating his work but the artist went further too. "I also researched on the history of sindoor or the orange colour applied on the idols of Lord Hanuman," said Terry. 
 The exhibition was inaugurated by Prof Vishambhar Nath Mishra, Mahant, Sankat Mochan Temple while  , curator of the show was spotted describing the work on display.
