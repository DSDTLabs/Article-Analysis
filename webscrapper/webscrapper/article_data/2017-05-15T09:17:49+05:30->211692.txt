CHENNAI: Passengers were put to untold miseries on Monday morning as the indefinite strike called by major trade unions affiliated to Opposition parties kickstarted across Tamil Nadu.

 Commuters complained of significant drop in frequency, as they were seen stranded at several bus terminuses and stops across Chennai city. "I am waiting for 25G route bus for the past 30 minutes," Jayashree, a passenger spotted at Vadapalani bus stop, said. The scene was similar at K K bus terminus. 
 
 Sources at Vadapalani bus terminus claimed that 65 buses of the usual 85 are plying since the morning. A chunk of crew members did not report for duty in the wake of the strike. 
 
 In a bid to counter the strike, the government has brought private mini buses plying in different districts of the state for operations in Chennai. Crew members were seen grappling with ticket tariff. Private operators have been roped in for inter-city operations to rest of Tamil Nadu from CMBT at Koyembedu.
