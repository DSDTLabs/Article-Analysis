NEW DELHI: Former   judge   tendered an unconditional apology on Friday to earn reprieve from criminal contempt proceedings initiated against him by the apex court for his rasping ‘personal criticism’ of a sitting SC judge.

 A bench of Justices   and U U Lalit, which had exempted Justice   from personal appearance after he tendered unconditional apology, dropped the criminal contempt proceedings initiated against him on November 11. 
 
 Justice Katju had written two blogs casting aspersions on Justice Gogoi’s legal knowledge while criticising a judgement by a Justice Gogoiheaded bench to set aside the death penalty of the convict in Kerala’s sensational  . 
 
 The convict was handed out a life sentence for sexual assault. Katju later filed an application tendering unconditional apology for writing the blogs.
