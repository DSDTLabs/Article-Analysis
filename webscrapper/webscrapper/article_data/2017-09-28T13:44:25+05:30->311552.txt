AHMEDABAD: The   has come down heavily on the   of   on short-term contracts and not regularizing their service. The court termed this practice as “exploitation of citizens” by the government.   said that forcing temporary employees to accept all service conditions and making them work for years can be considered exploitation of citizens. The judge rued the fact that such a practice continues though the Supreme Court has often deprecated it. The high court said that government departments “should not continue such a practice of temporary appointments for decades together and to appoint similar ad hoc and temporary workers”.

 The high court made these observations while admitting petitions filed by 28 civil engineers employed on contracts by the Police Housing Corporation, a company owned by the Gujarat government. These engineers have been working for more than a decade on the same positions without benefits normally extended to regular employees.
 
 The engineers also expressed apprehension that their contracts would be terminated and their services would be outsourced to private companies. They argued that they have attained an age at which they are not eligible for any new appointment. If they are retrenched, it would result not only in financial loss but also in stigma. The government maintained that engineers had agreed to the terms and termination could not be termed an illegality. It also submitted that there is no question of regularizing them because it does not have sanctioned posts or budget.
 
 After preliminary hearing, Justice Shah observed that the corporation has enough work to keep these engineers in service for a considerable time. The court admitted engineers’ petitions and stayed their possible retrenchment. The HC also ordered the government not to hire other people in their place on contracts. Further hearing on this matter is posted for December.
