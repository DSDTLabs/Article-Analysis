The stage is set for Canadian pop sensation Justin Bieber’s concert, which is scheduled to be held at Navi Mumbai’s Dr D Y   tomorrow. 

 With at least 45,000 fans expected at the venue in Nerul, the satellite city’s police and traffic departments have chalked out elaborate security, emergency, disaster management and traffic regulation plans.
 
 To begin with, the venue will be under extensive CCTV surveillance. Footage will be monitored from the control room every minute. Also, a lot of planning has gone into managing the crowd as efficiently as possible. Over 500 police personnel will be on duty. A few sniffer dogs will also be deployed. 
 
 When contacted,  , the commissioner of police,  , said, “Before the event, the venue will be screened by the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad. Drone cameras will be used for live feed, which will be monitored from the control room. We’re also deputing officials in civilian clothes.” 
 
 Given the expected footfall at the concert, parking arrangements for a large number of vehicles are also in place. A ground near the venue, which can accommodate up to 3,000 cars at a time, has been earmarked for this purpose. A shuttle service will also be provided from the parking lot to the venue. 
 
 In a bid to keep the roads decongested, the Navi Mumbai Traffic Police Department will divert traffic from the   to Uran Phaata exit on the Sion-Panvel highway. The service lanes around the stadium will also be blocked, while a few lanes in the vicinity will be turned into one-way roads for the day.
 
 S K Shinde, Senior Police Inspector, Turbhe Traffic Department, added, “Twenty officers and 200 constables will be deployed to manage traffic along with 100 volunteers. The organisers have also arranged for towing cars wherever 
 necessary.”
