ALAPPUZHA: Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, who arrived in Chengannur on Thursday to campaign for   candidate P S  , asked the voters in Kerala to dump the   in the   and thus get rid of the party. 

 
 Speaking at a rally in Mannar on Thursday, Deb said that Tripura people had buried CPM in a pond as the state did not have a sea. Kerala chief minister   too will face a similar fate, he added.
 
 "Vijayan is following in the footsteps of Manik Sarkar. He did not visit the home of Varapuzha custodial death victim due to fear. If he visited that home, the real picture behind the incident would come to light. CPM does not respect democracy or democratic values. It is seeking votes by threatening voters and murdering opponents. After 25 years of rule, people threw out CPM in Tripura. The same will take place in Kerala," he said.
 
 Biplab said that both LDF and   were two sides of the same coin. "They are ruling the state one after another without doing anything for public benefit.   will soon become a thing of past. The intention of my visit is to end the CPM rule here and ensure the victory of NDA candidate in Chengannur. It will boost our prospects of coming to power in the state in the next assembly election," he said.
