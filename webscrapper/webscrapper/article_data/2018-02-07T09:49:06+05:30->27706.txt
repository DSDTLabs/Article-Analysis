NEW DELHI:  's Prime Minister   wants the word 'mankind' to be replaced by 'peoplekind', reported Canada's National Post.

 The word 'humankind' seems to have eluded the honourable Prime Minister. And Twitter's reactions ranged from "true feminist" to "  gone too far".
 
 At a townhall meeting last week in Canada's   province, he interrupted an audience member - a woman - to say "peoplekind" is a better representation of the citizenry comprising men, women, those who don't identify as men or women, and transgenders. 
 
 The woman used the phrase "the future of mankind" in her question or comment. 
 
 "We like to say 'peoplekind,' not necessarily 'mankind,' because it's more inclusive," said Trudeau, interrupting her.
 
 Many on Twitter posted a clip of that exchange.
 
  
  
 Aside from "that's great" and "this is political correctness/Leftism gone too far", some also reacted saying Trudeau "mansplaining".That last one, 'mansplaining', means a man condescendingly explaining something to a woman. 
 
  
  
 Some saw Trudeau's comment as feminist and nothing but.
 
  
  
 Some others called it "peak  " and political correctness taken to its extreme. 
 
  
  
 Guess there's no pleasing all of 'peoplekind' all of the time.
