PANAJI: The directorate of health services’ (DHS) plan to outsource its under-utilized   at   and   is likely to be shelved.

 Health minister   said he is totally against giving out any of the DHS’ OTs to private parties to operate. The proposal was moved about six months ago, while former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza held the health portfolio.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Rane said he is not at all in favour of either leasing out or outsourcing OTs at district hospitals or community health centers. Rane, however, did not elaborate whether he proposes to fully use either unutilized or underutilized OTs.
 
 DHS officials had been mum about the proposals, an official said. A few months ago, a section of officers wanted to outsource the facilities, though others felt it was a “ridiculous” thing to do.
 
 The OTs, at some of the hospitals, have remained under-utilized because most of these hospitals did not have the required number of specialists.
 
 A senior doctor of   (GMC) and hospital Bambolim, termed the idea of outsourcing as an “idiotic” one.
 
 “It’s like you want to outsource your kitchen because you can’t cook. At the most, the government should be more careful in investing in infrastructure in the health sector,” he said.
 
 Attempts were made at filling vacancies over the last two years, still not all vacant posts were filled up. 
 
 The same holds true of community health centers located in rural parts of the state. Many doctors joining government service are reluctant to take postings in villages, and the government faces a difficulty in filling up those posts.
 
 A government official said the health department has to be firm, and should not consider requests for transfers unless the reason offered is genuine.
 
 He said if the government doesn’t make its policy clear on this, it will continue to face this problem. 
 
 The health institutes in the rural parts or district hospitals will remain paralyzed if fails to attract experts to work for it.
