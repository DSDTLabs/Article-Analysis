NEW DELHI: Justifying its decision to join China’s “One Belt, One Road” project despite India opposition, Nepal said on Saturday it could not ignore China as the latter was not just an economic powerhouse but also its neighbour.

 Talking to TOI, Nepal’s envoy to India Deep Kumar Upadhyaya said New Delhi’s 
  . “Nepal will never give India grief but it cannot remain indifferent to a big economic power like China as it seeks more foreign investment and development,” said Upadhyaya.
 
 India’s main concern about   is the fact that  , which is a part of the same, passes through Pakistan-controlled   region, which India claims as its own.
 
 Moreover, 
  and the manner in which it has sought to engage with India’s neighbours like Sri Lanka and Maldives, overwhelming them with loans to build strategic assets like ports, have only further unnerved India.
 
 For the OBOR conference on Sunday, Nepal has sent its deputy PM and finance minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara.
 
 “We are aware of 
  about CPEC but Nepal is not taking any position on the issue by joining OBOR,” said Upadhyaya.
 
 “We would like the two countries to resolve their differences amicably. And on any security-related issue between China and India, Nepal’s position is neutral. 
 
 However, for Nepal to benefit economically, it is important we have better ties with our neighbour to the north too,” he said. He pointed to how other Indian neighbours like Sri Lanka too have endorsed OBOR.
 
 Sri Lanka’s current debt crisis originated from the loans which the country acquired from China at a high rate of interest under former President  .
 
 According to some estimates, Maldives now owes almost 70% of its external debt to China. About 65 countries are participating in the conference.
