PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday asked the joint admission board (JAB) to furnish segregated data of students who appeared in and qualified the   Main examinations through online and offline modes in 2016 and 2017. 

 The JAB conducts the joint entrance examination (JEE) for admission in IITs, NITs and some other engineering colleges across the country. The bench of Justice   was hearing a batch of writ petitions filed by Narendra Prasad and others.
 
 Prasad and other petitioners moved the high court against the JAB’s decision to conduct the JEE (Main) examination only through online mode from this year. The court also ordered the central government to reply if it had given its consent to the JAB for conducting JEE examination only through online mode.
 
 Union of India’s additional solicitor general S D Sanjay said the matter would come up for hearing on Friday. Advocate   represented Prasad while Y V   represented the JAB.
 
 The petitioner pleaded to the court to issue order to the authorities concerned to also conduct examination through offline mode as several students belonging to middle class families and not much familiar with computer would have poor performance if the examination is conducted online only.
 
 He also pleaded that online mode would help those students perform better who are familiar with computers.
 
 The petitioners have urged the court to order the JAB to conduct the JEE (Advanced) scheduled to take place in May this year through offline mode also.
