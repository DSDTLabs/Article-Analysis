PUNE: Patients visiting civic hospitals and dispensaries will get   at nominal charges in two months. 

 The services currently that are limited to basic lab tests and X-rays will be expanded and made available at the Pune Municipal Corporation-run 18 hospitals and 44 dispensaries.
 
 The civic administration has decided to outsource the diagnostic work to a private service provider. At least 250 pathology and radiology tests now limited to 50 tests at civic-run healthcare establishments will be available. Health activists said outsourcing the tests to the private sector was an inefficient way of providing services.
 
 "Three service providers have come forward. The rates will be at par with   and the services are likely to become operational in the next two months," S T Pardeshi, chief of the health department at  , said. 
 
 Assistant medical officer   said, "People visiting civic hospitals have to spend as currently there are only 50 tests available here. Vacant posts of experts and technicians could not be filled despite publishing advertisements several times. Outsourcing of diagnostic work will help people avail services including high-end radiological and laboratory tests at government rates." 
 
 Poor patients under PMC's urban poor health scheme can get 50% reduced rates. The remaining 50% will be borne by PMC. A budgetary provision of Rs 2 crore for 2017-18 has been proposed, Wavare added. 
 
 Health activist   said outsourcing diagnostic work will not serve any purpose and PMC should strengthen its healthcare facilities.
