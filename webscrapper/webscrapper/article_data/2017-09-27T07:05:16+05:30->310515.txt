CHENNAI: With increase in the number of fever cases, including dengue, across the state, the public   has organised a brainstorming session with private   and doctors to prevent delay in treatment and deaths.

 While there has been more than a 25% increase in fever cases reported across clinics and hospitals, more than 130 people have been confirmed positive for dengue this year. In the past one week, there have been at least three dengue deaths.
 
 While officials and senior government doctors asked private practitioners to conduct tests for malaria, dengue, chikungunya, typhoid and leptospirosis for people reporting with fever, body ache and rashes to ensure early diagnosis, doctors from private hospitals urged the government to step up awareness programmes and vector control measures.
 
 “It's the fever season now, but we think that if the system is prepared we will be able to prevent deaths. We are telling smaller hospitals, nursing homes and clinics to refer patients to bigger hospitals with ICU facilities if they suspect that the patient could be critical,“ health minister C Vijaya Baskar told about 1,000 doctors who attended the meeting.
 
 The minister told doctors not charge patients with fever excessively. “Hospitals must brief patients about the treatment costs.If they need admission and can't afford, they should be sent to state-run facilities where treatment is free,“ he said.
