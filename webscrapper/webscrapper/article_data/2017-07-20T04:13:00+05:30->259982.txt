Nagpur: Functioning of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) office and administration department has come under scanner after it proposed to fill two posts — prosecutor and civil court agent — by promoting   employees.

 The department, under pressure from NMC’s legal consultative committee, ignored the rules framed for appointment and promotions framed by the NMC as per a resolution passed on April 12, 1976.
 
 The proposal to promote food inspector VD Kaple to the post of prosecutor and SB Fating as civil court agent will come before the general body meeting to be held on July 20.
 
 As per   rules, qualification for both the posts are different, confirmed a source in the NMC. Sources said Fating is five years senior to Kaple. 
 
 The post of prosecutor is to be filled by way of promotion from the lower post of civil court agent on the basis of seniority and merit. The post of civil court agent should be filled through open advertisement.
 
 In October 2016, the legal consultative committee, then headed by BJP corporator and lawyer Sanjay Balpande, allegedly changed the terms and conditions to fill the posts. As per law, service condition for filling the posts are to be changed either with consultations with recognized unions or with the state government’s approval. Initially, the department objected to the changes and in a ‘notesheet’ suggested that government’s sanction was a must for changing the rules of departmental promotions.
 
 Despite this, the committee managed to table the proposal which favoured some of the civic body employees, which too was objected by not only employees but also by a social activist Kishore Samudre. Even the guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, after receiving complaints, had asked the civic administration to look into the issue. But nothing has happened.
