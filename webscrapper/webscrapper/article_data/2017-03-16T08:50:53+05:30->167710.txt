LUCKNOW: Diversions for   have been altered with effect from March 15 and now traffic from Parivartan towards GPO crossing will have to take the opposite side from   trisection up to Sahu Cinema. 

 As per   Rail Corporation’s plan, underground Hazratganj station has to be constructed below MG Road from DRM office up to Mayfair trisection, which would cover complete road-width from underground. Since MG Road cannot be blocked completely,   will barricade one side while keeping the other side open for vehicle movement both ways. 
 
 So far, traffic from GPO towards Parivartan crossing was diverted towards Sahu Cinema side from Janpath Market up to Mayfair trisection but now this side has been opened for direct movement while other side has been closed. 
 
 LMRC managing director Kumar Keshav told TOI, “Now, we have barricaded the road towards Sahu Cinema side while opening the Janpath market side as we now have to begin underground construction on the opposite side. For about one year, people will get only half the width of MG Road to commute on both sides. The underground construction of Hazratganj station will take about a year, hence people will have to bear with us for some time.”
 
 The engineer in charge of the project said in any case, LMRC will always open half of road for traffic movement. “We have begun trial to see the requirements and problems faced by public as per new diversion plan of Hazratganj. We will deploy   marshals and barricades depending on actual need”, he said. Director of works and infrastructure, Daljeet Singh said LMRC has already concretised about 50metre patch near Janpath and will gradually concretise the remaining dug up portion too.
