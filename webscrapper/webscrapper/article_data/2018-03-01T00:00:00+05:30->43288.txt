Janardhan Chikanna’s soon-to-be-released film,  , has left many people wondering about what the   means. While most people believe that it is a cuss word in Kannada, Janardhan clears the mystery around the title… sort of.
Speaking to Bangalore Times, he says, “There’s a small portion in the film that deals with   and decrypting, which are coding an information with a key, so that it can be sent to your destination without any interruption, loss or anyone knowing about it. Since the film is a   that deals with cybercrimes, I thought that instead of a straight title, an encrypted one would create the right amount of curiosity.”
 And create curiosity it has. When we prod him about the meaning of the title, if at all there is one, all Janardhan says is, “There is definitely a meaning to the word, but you will understand that only once you watch the film.” 
 The title of this suspense-thriller has sure left us in further suspense. Any guesses as to what it means?
