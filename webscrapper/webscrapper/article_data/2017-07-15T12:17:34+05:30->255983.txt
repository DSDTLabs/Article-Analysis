PUNE: The College of Military Engineering has come out with an advisory for its   and   to avoid   trips to tourist or adventure destinations where they can be vulnerable to accidents.

 The   is a premier institution that trains young officers commissioned into the Indian Army’s corps of engineers and also officers and men from the Indian Air Force and Navy, paramilitary forces and officers from friendly foreign countries. It houses important training establishments like Institute of National Integration, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Training Institution, Combat Engineering Department and the Army Rowing Node, among others. 
 
 A senior CME officer told TOI, “It is necessary to instruct and alert officers who are serving or are undergoing training in different establishments on the CME campus. They have been asked to avoid places where there is a high possibility of facing an untoward incident or an accident. They have also been instructed to remain in contact with the authorities, in case they are venturing out for outings.”
 
 The CME allow its officers to leave the campus on weekends and if they want to leave on working days, particularly after 11 pm, they have to take permission from the authority concerned. “Those training at the Cadets Training Wing are not allowed to leave the campus unless they get permission from the CTW commandant. Security of the campus is of paramount importance for us which makes the prior permission mandatory,” the officer added.
