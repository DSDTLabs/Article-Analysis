PATNA: The Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly election result has created ripples in the political arena in Bihar. RJD vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh on Tuesday criticized chief minister   Kumar once again and claimed that his silence on demonetisation benefited the BJP in UP.

 “Nitish is asking his party spokespersons to demean me by making abusive statements. But he played a double game in UP as he didn’t oppose demonetisation. He went to UP many times prior to election, but his party didn’t contest there and he kept quiet on demonetisation. Ultimately, it benefited the BJP in UP election,” Raghuvansh told newsmen in Vaishali.
 
 The war of words erupted in the political galleries in Bihar soon after the declaration of UP election results on Saturday. Raghuvansh was particularly miffed over the statements made against him by JD(U) general secretary Shyam Rajak and spokesman Sanjay Singh.
 
 Fresh verbal volleys were exchanged between JD(U) and RJD members when BJP leader and Union minister Ram Kripal Yadav visited Rajak and Sanjay on Holi on Monday.
 
 “RJD is keeping a close watch on the political development. RJD is making all efforts to keep the alliance strong and we expect the same from other alliance partners,” said RJD legislator Bhai Virendra.
 
 Meanwhile, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president and state education minister Ashok Choudhary tried to mediate and said, “We should avoid making controversial and provocative statements and all issues should be sorted out with mutual talks. Moreover, state presidents of all three parties can sit and sort out the issues which are creating controversies.”
