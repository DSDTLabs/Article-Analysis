The Juhu police on Thursday arrested a youth for trespassing actor  's Juhu bungalow, Jalsa. The 19-year-old man, identified as   from  , has told the police that he had come to Mumbai because his sister is seeking medical treatment in the city and he wanted 'some financial help' from the superstar in this connection.

 According to the police, the incident happened in the afternoon yesterday when the senior Bachchan was at his residence.
 
  
  
 In his statement, Khan, who hails from UP's   municipality, has said that he had heard about Bachchan helping those in need and had wanted to meet him to see if he could loan some cash. But when he could not get past the security guards at the actor's house, he decided to make a surreptitious entry by jumping over the compound wall.
 
 However as soon as he made a leap inside the premises, he was caught by the actor's security guards, and taken out of the compound. He started calling out for help to Bachchan himself. Without alerting the star or his family members, the security staff handed him over to Juhu police station.
 
 Khan said he felt compelled to sneak in after his previous attempts to meet the superstar had failed. He was booked under section 447 (criminal trespassing) of the Indian Penal Code and produced in court.
 
 Senior inspector   of Juhu police station confirmed the incident but refused to divulge more details. "Appropriate action is being taken," he said.
 
 A similar incident was reported in August last year when a person who was identified as Banwari Lal Yadav, 25, a resident of Pune, jumped over Jalsa's compound wall after deceiving the security guards. The incident occurred when fans and well wishers had gathered to get a glimpse of Big B.
