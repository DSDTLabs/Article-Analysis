ERODE:   leader   continued his tirade against the central government policies for the second consecutive day on Sunday, saying demonetisation was not done “properly”.
 
 Talking to reporters here during his two-day visit to the Gounder belt, which is also chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s turf, the actor said the Goods and Services Tax (GST) should be thrown into the dust bin.
 
 “The new tax regime has badly hit many industrial sectors and a large cross-section of people,” he said.
 
 The actor also said there was nothing wrong in Tamil MPs putting in their papers over Cauvery Management Board issue. 
 
 Amid the raging controversy over BJP leader H Raja’s disparaging social media post against Periyar, Kamal arrived at the press meet hall only after visiting the DK founder’s birth place in Erode town. “It’s like visiting my father’s house. And it is not my first ever visit to Periyar’s birthplace,” the actor said.
 
 Kamal also said Periyar wouldn’t have allowed statue culture, if he were alive toady.
 
 Asked about the political scenario of the state, the actor-turned politician said the law and order situation has deteriorated and he was saddened about increasing attacks against women. “People of Tamil Nadu are looking for a change. And they are hopeful that I would bring that change," he said. The actor also termed his two-day visit to Erode a journey towards people. 
 
 Referring to charges of christian missions funding his party, Kamal said they were baseless allegations.
 
 Replying to MDMK president Vaiko's comment that Kamal was just taking baby steps in politics and needn’t teach him politics and speeches, the actor said, “Vaiko is a good orator and there is no need for me to teach him anything.” 
 
 Kamal, among other things, said he would extend support to Athikadavu-Avinashi water project.
