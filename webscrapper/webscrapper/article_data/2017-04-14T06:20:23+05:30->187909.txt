LUCKNOW: Resident Doctors’ Association of King George’s Medical University on Thursday said they will exercise legal options if   of two residents—which they claimed was done without hearing their side—was not revoked by Friday. The two residents of the surgery department were suspended on Wednesday following a brawl with the attendant of a patient from Musafirkhana (Amethi). 

 “We have written to the vice chancellor for re-evaluation of the suspension of two junior doctors and if there is no response within 24 hours, we would initiate legal recourse as the suspension was based on a one-sided complaint,” said Dr Ganesh, general secretary of  . 
 
 The university, on the other hand, sent a notice to the attendant to depose before the inquiry committee formed to probe the matter on April 18. The attendant, who was the complainant in the case, did not appear before the committee on Wednesday. “If the attendant fails to appear again, the university would quash the preliminary complaint,” said U B Mishra, chief medical superintendent. He also said, “Currently there are no talks of revoking the suspension since we have to wait for the four-member probe committee to furnish its report. If the doctors are found innocent, their suspension will indeed be cancelled.”
