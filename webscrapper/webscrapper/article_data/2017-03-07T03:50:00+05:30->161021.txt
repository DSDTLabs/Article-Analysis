Nagpur: The Dinkar Zoting commission, which is probing the allegations against former revenue minister Eknath Khadse, on Monday directed MIDC to file a status report of a writ petition pending at Bombay High Court. The plea was regarding the ownership of the Bhosari land. The MIDC was asked to submit the report before March 14, after which the hearing was adjourned. The move came after MIDC’s counsel Chandrashekhar Jaltare filed an application seeking time to file a status report of the pending case. He said the MIDC has been trying to get current status of the writ petition, however, a report regarding same wasn’t received. The case would be heard on March 9. The corporation would be in a position to make a statement regarding the case only after the hearing, he said. The one-man commission probed an illegal land transfer by khadse. It was appointed by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis after the opposition alleged that an MIDC plot at Bhosari, Pune was transferred in the name of Khadse’s wife. It was a clear case of conflict of interest by the minister who had exercised his quasi-judicial powers to clear the land transfer.
