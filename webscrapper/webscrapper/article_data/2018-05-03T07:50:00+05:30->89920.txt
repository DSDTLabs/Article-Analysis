Bathinda: A farmer of Ghanga Kalan village was killed after being struck by lightning as high-velocity wind and rain lashed parts of Punjab on Wednesday. The victim, Gurcharan Singh, 60, a resident of Ghanga Kalan village, situated on Jalalabad-Muktsar road in Fazilka district, had gone to the village pond with his cattle when the weather changed suddenly. As he tried to come out of the pond, he was struck by a bolt of lightning, which killed him, said Karamjit Singh, a village resident.

 Also, the dust storm caused losses to farmers who had sown capsicum at Bhainibagha village of Mansa as the crop was flattened by the wind. Farmer Baghel Singh said, “We had sown capsicum over three acres but the squall caused damage to the crop as the plants were flattened.”
