NEW DELHI: BJP’s vision document for the   is going to focus on how to “enhance the quality of urban life” in the capital. And for a better Delhi, the party plans to emulate examples of other BJP-ruled civic bodies.

 “BJP is ruling more than 72 civic bodies in India and have done remarkable work,” said Rajya Sabha  , head of the election management committee. “In Nagpur, we have used sewer water to generate electricity. In Bengaluru, we have put in place a system to ensure transparency and accountability in the functioning of municipal body. In Indore, the corporation has developed colony roads based on public-private partnership. Ahmedabad has the best BRT system. The deputy CM of UP, Dinesh Sharma, had developed a Kanha upvan for stray animals in Lucknow during his stint as mayor,” he said.
 
 To achieve this, there is a need for better coordination among the Centre, the state and the local bodies, Sahasrabuddhe said. “We will be going more into the micro-level. We will tell people about our work and what we intend to do. The aspirations and concerns of people in each ward will be the focus of our agenda.”
 
  says the corporations have faced a lot of hurdles from the unsupportive   government. The party will now project its work and the schemes sanctioned by the Centre. “We will also tell people about the disruptive politics of AAP government,” the MP said. On sitting councillors not getting tickets, he said, “Now, everything is settled. We need to groom our councillors to think big and give fresh blood a chance.”
