NEW DELHI: BJP on Saturday released a fresh set of documents to link Congress members, including  , with tainted diamond czar   and his associates, and said the scam started under UPA.

 
 "Congress indulges in such scandalous affairs, misuses important positions in government, then quietly covers up everything they do. Instead of explaining how it happened during their tenure, they're casting allegations. Original sin in this episode of Nirav Modi was committed in 2011," senior BJP member and defence minister   said at a press conference.
 
 Sitharaman said Singhvi's wife Anita Singhvi and son Avishkar Manas Singhvi were directors of a private holding firm that had dealings with the jewellery companies of Nirav and Mehul in Mumbai. "You promote Gitanjali Gems, give them building on lease, your wife is a director, and accuse us of wrongdoing. Despite the clear link with them, Congress party has the audacity to point fingers at BJP," the defence minister said.
 
 She alleged that "concerted repeating of lies for misleading people may be a strategy Congress likes to adopt". "But I am sorry the facts are facing you and it is for them to answer," she said and added, "Congress attempt to mislead people is just not going to happen."
