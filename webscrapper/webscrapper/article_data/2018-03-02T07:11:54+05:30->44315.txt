BENGALURU: The city may soon house a landmark, on the lines of New York City’s Times Square, at the   intersection in the central business district (CBD) where a war memorial stands at present.

 BBMP officials have extensive plans to transform the junction into a prominent tourist destination.
 
 Mayor R Sampath Raj announced this on Thursday during the reopening of the relaid Church Street. The stretch had largely remained out of bounds for the past year as rain and other factors led to the TenderSURE work missing many deadlines.
 
 The street was last on the itinerary of chief minister Siddaramaiah and Bengaluru development minister K J George, who also inaugurated Phase 1 of the Okalipuram eight-lane corridor.
 
 Siddaramaiah didn’t wait for the actual reopening of Church Street and rushed to Pavagada in Tumakuru on official work, leaving   MLA N A   and George to do the honours.
 
 “We want the city to have a Bengaluru Square similar to Times Square. We are planning it at the entrance of Brigade Road. Bengaluru is fast becoming a global city, and there should be something to celebrate that. We have asked Swati Ramanathan, the brain behind TenderSURE, to start working on a detailed project report,” the mayor said.
 
 He said the revamp was an attempt to make the street a world-class tourist destination. “MG Road and Church Street are must-visit spots for tourists. A lot of citizens have told us that they want Church Street to be a walkers’ zone. We will convey their demand to the authorities concerned. Church Street will also have easy access to the upcoming pod taxi service,” he said.
 
 Haris claimed Church Street is the first ‘handmade’ road in the country. “Every stone was laid individually. It’s an asset...,” he said.
