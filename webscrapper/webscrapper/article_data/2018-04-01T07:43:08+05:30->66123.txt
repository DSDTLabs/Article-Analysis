MYSURU:  's national president   on Saturday launched a scathing attack on CM   saying, "The   government is like an ATM for   to indulge in corruption." 

  Winding up his two-day tour of Mysuru, Chamarajanagar and Mandya districts, Shah said the Karnataka elections will have a bearing on the 2019 elections. He exuded confidence that BJP is the only alternative for Karnataka, which, he claimed, has become a 'den of corruption' under Congress. "I do not see any competition from the Siddaramaiah government as people have made up their mind to remove the corrupt government," he said. 
 
  Shah said a victory in Karnataka would be a stepping stone for BJP's expansionist policy. "Winning the elections here will open the door for BJP to the southern part of the country," he said. 
 
  He cited the model code of conduct and refrained from commenting on the Lingayat minority tag issue. He reiterated the controversy was fuelled by Siddaramaiah and Congress for electoral gain. He added the party won't retract its assurance given to its CM candidate B S Yeddyurappa. 
 
  Despite stating a vote to JD(S) will be a vote to Congress, Shah recognised the regional party as a force in some regions of the state.
