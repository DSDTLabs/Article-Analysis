NEW DELHI: A gang that used to   iPhones for sale in the bordering villages of Nepal and   areas was busted on Sunday. Police have recovered 15   from them. The gang members used to steal or   the phones from metro stations and supply it to their kingpin based near Jama Masjid. Cops are trying to trace the phone owners.

 The arrested men, Shazada Nizam and Mohd Shahid, used to target iPhone users near   and Hauz Khas. They would pickpocket phones or snatch them while the victim was stepping out of a metro station. By the time the victim realised that his phone was gone, the snatchers would escape on a vehicle parked nearby.
 
 DCP (central) Mandeep Singh Randhawa formed a team led by SHO ( ) Mangesh to track the gang. A trap was laid and the men were caught while waiting for an associate who would take the phones to the suppliers.
 
 The men told police they had stolen around 150 iPhones in the NCR. They used to target people in busy areas like malls and bus stops. Each phone would be sold for Rs 15,000-20,000. They would steal 40 phones in a month and hand it to a supplier. They generally targeted users of iPhone 6 or 7 since these phones are easier to hide.
 
 The phones were usually sold in the forested areas of Jharkhand and Odisha or Nepal, where it would be difficult to trace them. The buyers would be asked to use the phones with a SIM card specific to the region to avoid detection.
