NAVI MUMBAI:   node is set to get a 100-bed   coming from across the country to get treated at Tata Hospital.

 The facility, soon to be constructed by   (JACAF), will come up on a Cidco-developed plot measuring 600 sqm opposite the hospital in sector 29.
 
 The facility will have 40 rooms and will be build at an approximate cost of Rs 5 crore where patients can stay for free. It will also have a day-care centre with free chemotherapy and mammography facilities in place.
 
  Members of the foundation are retired officers, doctors, professionals and philanthropists. It has been providing shelters to over 50 outstation patients in as many as eight rented flats in Koparkhairane since 1996 along with other facilites like free ambulance and bus services from shelter homes to hospitals. It also provides free meals to patients and meals at subsidized rates to attendants. 
 
 “The rented flats in Koparkhairane are no longer enough to accommodate the increasing number of patients. This prompted us to obtain our own land. The project was delayed due to lack of finances. With funds flowing in from philanthropists and corporate houses, the construction will start soon,” said Dr Prashant Mohanty, a JACAF member.
 
 The foundation has so far conducted over 1,200 cancer-detection camps in various states and helped over 25,000 patients with free shelters.
