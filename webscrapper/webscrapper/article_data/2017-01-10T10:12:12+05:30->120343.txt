RANCHI: Latest reports on   released by the   (NCRB) indicate that the number of such   in the state stood at 2,893 in 2015, which is the highest in the  . 

 Even though the total number of accidents in 2015 (5,162) has decreased as compared to the number of accidents in 2014 (5,201), the rate of severe accidents has increased by 5.5%. This has brought the overall rate to 56%, which is considerably higher than the national average of 29.1%. 
 
 The total number of fatal accidents was 2219, of which 1205 occurred in rural areas and 1414 in urban ones. 
 
 Maximum number of deaths were reported on two wheelers (895) and there was also a considerable spike in the number of deaths on highways in 2015 (2,105) as compared to 2014 (1,379). 
 
 Sanjay Ranjan Singh, traffic SP, Ranchi, said, "It is an unfortunate truth that the fatality rate of accidents in the state is almost 60% of the total number of accidents. Over speeding is one of the reasons for the increase. Due to insufficient trauma centres and ambulances, victims do not get proper attention.''
 
 A special committee constituting a special engineer, an executive engineer and a DSP has been set up to address the issues of high fatality. The team will identify the reasons for the high rate of fatality on Jharkhand roads and address the problem through scientific solutions. 
 
 The traffic SP also said, "The case filed never mentioned what the real reason for accidents were and this committee will assess the black spots on Jharkhand roads (spots with a high incidence of accidents) and ensure that the marked areas are made safer. The absence of rumble strips on state roads is a major reason that has been identified so far."
 
 "A lot of progress has been made since 2015 and it will reflect in the statistics released next year. However, all our efforts will go in vain unless people develop a basic driving sense," he added.
