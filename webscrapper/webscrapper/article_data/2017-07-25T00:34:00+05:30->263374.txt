Coimbatore: The production of motor pumps in the city has dropped 70% since the middle of June, motor   manufacturers here say. This has also impacted the earnings of daily wage workers in small and micro pump manufacturing units as they find work only for a few days.

 The prevailing confusion over the tax rates of machine parts has cut down orders, said the president of the Kovai Power Driven Pump and Spare Parts Manufacturers’ Association (Kopma), K Maniraj. “The industry does an average business of Rs 50 crore a day. But, since June 15, it has come down by 70%,” he told TOI.
 
 “Some said the price of motor pumps will fall after  . But, looking at the tax rates and the sales that we have done in the past three weeks, manufacturers are shelling out more on taxes,” said Maniraj. “This confusion has forced many manufacturers to stop taking orders,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, Ganeshan R, a 41-year-old mechanic working for a major pump manufacturer for Rs 450 a day, is searching for a job for his wife Sreeja. “For the past one month I have not been able to find work for more than three days a week. I have been in this field for more than 25years and it is hard for me to find a job somewhere else,” he said.
 
 Many like Ganeshan have borrowed money from employers or neighbours to make ends meet. “I was forced to borrow money from my employer and even from neighbours to manage the monthly expenses. If things do not revive, I will have to start looking for alternative work options,” said 50-year-old Sargunam S.
 
 Business post July is usually dull and if the situation continues for a few more weeks, it will have a severe impact on manufacturers, Maniraj said. “We have approached the State and the Central government to help us resolve the problem. On multiple occasions, we wrote to Union ministers. But nothing has happened so far,” he added.
