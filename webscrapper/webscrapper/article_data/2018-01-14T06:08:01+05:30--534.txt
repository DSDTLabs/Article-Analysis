PANAJI: Hundreds of passengers at the   bus stand had nowhere to go after private bus operators announced a sudden strike on Saturday. The strike was the culmination of an altercation between them and some staffers from the state-run   ( ) on Thursday regarding Panaji-Ponda bus services. 

 The state-run and private bus operators along this route haven't been on the best of terms lately, according to sources in the know. Things came to a tipping point on Thursday at the   bus stand. A Kadamba bus was queued behind some private buses, and some KTC staffers alleged that the private bus didn't leave on time, thus enabling them to get a larger chunk of the commuters. 
 
 
 
 Annoyed, one KTC driver confronted a private bus driver, Sainath Naik, and filed a complaint against him with the depot. He then allegedly hit Naik, who retaliated.
 
 KTC staff confronted Naik and his colleagues again on Saturday at the Panaji bus stand. A traffic cop, Deepak Phadte, who was offduty at the time, began to film the incident on his cellphone. One KTC staffer allegedly snatched the phone, assaulted Phadte and threatened him. Private bus operators then demanded an FIR against the KTC staffer and pressed for his arrest. They announced a strike at around 12.30pm, which was observed by private operators all over Goa. In the evening, the operators led a morcha to the Panaji police station to demand the KTC staffer’s arrest.
 
 The Panaji police registered two FIRs against the KTC employee, based on complaints by the private bus driver and the traffic cop. General secretary of the All Goa Bus Owners’ Association, Sudeep Tamankar, said the operators were assured of a probe, after which they called off the strike.
 
 KTC chairman Carlos Almeida said he would ask the director of transport to set up a coordination committee comprising KTC members and some private operators. On allegations against the KTC staffer, he said, “We will conduct an inquiry and take the necessary action.” TNN
