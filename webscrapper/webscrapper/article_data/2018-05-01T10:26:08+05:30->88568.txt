BENGALURU: A crafty game of chess has just begun: As CM Siddaramaiah tries to safeguard his political future by contesting from   and  , 605km apart, JD(S) and   are playing on each other’s strengths to lock him in and alienate him from his home turf.

 
 With 59 seats at stake in  , the two opposition parties have reached a tacit understanding. BJP’s B Sreeramulu will give the CM a tough fight in Badami, and JD(S) will ensure that it grabs the Vokkaliga vote in Chamundeshwari.
 
 BJP, which has a weak base in Old Mysuru, is looking to JD(S) to launch a serious offensive in Chamundeshwari, and make Siddaramaiah too jittery to leave the constituency. Simultaneously, the party has rolled out big gun Sreeramulu in Badami, who could leave Siddaramaiah uneasy here too. He cannot bank purely on the caste matrix for a walkover, with the OBC, primarily Kurubas, comprising 42,000 of the 2.14lakh electorate.
 
 “Fielding Sreeramulu in Badami is only to lock Siddaramaiah in the constituency. We are not looking at a victory for him, but to ensure the CM does not take Badami lightly and is forced to run a campaign personally in  ,” said a BJP party worker.
 
 As a result, Siddaramaiah may neither be able to protect Chamundeshwari nor help son Yathindra in Varuna, towards the last leg of campaign.
 
 Meanwhile, JD(S) is ensuring there is no respite for Siddaramaiah in both constituencies by putting up strong contenders. While in Badami, Hanamanth Mavinmarad is expected to consolidate Lingayat votes, in Chamundeshwari, the personal prestige in the tussle between the   family and Siddaramaiah is expected to counter-consolidate the Vokkaligas.
 
 Mavinmarad says: “For us, it’s a win-win situation. The CM cannot take JD(S) lightly in Chamundeshwari or Badami. When he comes to Badami, our strategy will be simple. Ask a question daily on what his government has done for the constituency, and lock him into answering the people.”
