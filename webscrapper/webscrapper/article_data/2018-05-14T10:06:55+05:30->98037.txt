HYDERABAD: A pollution monitoring station at US   at Begumpet has revealed that on most days air quality is ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’. On Sunday evening, Air Quality Index (AQI) was 126. On May 8and May 9, the index was worse and above 150. In a tweet, US Consulate General stated: “The US Consulate General’s air pollution monitor covers the area of Secunderabad. The data displays are   air quality index.”

 
 A message by the Consulate says, “When AQI values are between 101 and 150, members of sensitive groups may experience health effects, but general public is unlikely to be affected.” when AQI is between 151 and 200, “everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects (sic).”
 
 The consulate is monitoring air quality about particulate matter (PM) 2.5 at the Consulate compound at Begumpet. The US Consulate doesn’t monitor other pollutants.
 
 Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality bulletin released on Sunday afternoon categorised Hyderabad as ‘moderate’, which implies breathing discomfort for people suffering from lung and heart diseases.
 
  chief scientific officer P Veeranna told TOI, “TPCB has four continuous monitoring stations and 18 manual monitoring units in   limits. We have a particulate pollution problem.”
