CHENNAI: With the state government gearing up to expand   (CMA) seven-fold times, a few farmers’ associations in Kancheepuram district have opposed the move saying the development would be a threat to farmlands. A collective body of residents’ welfare association in Kancheepuram town has also raised concerns over the expansion citing lack of infrastructure facilities in the district.

 At a consultation meeting organised by the   ( ) in Kancheepuram to elicit the views of local people, developers’ associations and NGOs, the representatives of farmers and residents’ welfare associations raised the issue.
  
  
 K Nehru, Kancheepuram district secretary of the  , who participated in the meeting, said that agricultural activities would take a heavy beating if the entire district comes under the purview of CMA. “At present, agriculture is carried out in about 1.85 hectres of land in Kancheepuram, of which about 70% is fertile land with potential for cultivating three-time crop. After the power to grant planning permission goes to CMDA, officials will offer approvals without inspecting the site to verify the nature of land, leading to fast disappearance of farmlands,” he said.
 
 E Muthukumar, president of Federation of Kancheepuram Residents’ Welfare Associations, said Kancheepuram town and its peripheries do not have any infrastructure facilities such as sewerage system. “Moreover, getting planning permissions for constructions would become aherculean task with CMDA unlike the local bodies,” he added.
 
 Official sources with CMDA said that planning approvals for small developments would continue with the local bodies as the planning authority would deal only with major constructions. “A land use map will be prepared, where fertile lands would be earmarked as agriculture zone. In fact, it would help to preserve farmland, as land use zone is currently not available in the non-CMDA areas,” the official added.
