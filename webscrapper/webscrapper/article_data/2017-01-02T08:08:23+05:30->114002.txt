LUCKNOW: The   convention on Sunday trigerred a   of sackings by the two Yadav camps. Minutes after SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav proposed the removal of Shivpal Yadav from the post of state SP president and sacking of Amar Singh from the party, the Mulayam camp retaliated by expelling party vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda.

 Kiranmoy, an old Mulayam loyalist, has been the party vice-president for over a decade but was shown the door for presiding over the proceedings of the convention where   was declared the SP national president. “The convention was declared unconstitutional by SP chief  , still you participated in the event which amounts to gross indiscipline....you are being expelled from the party for six years,” the letter issued by Mulayam said.
 
 However, the action against Kiranmoy, who is also SP Rajya Sabha MP, did not deter Akhilesh Yadav from appointing his close associate and MLC Naresh Chandra Uttam as the state SP chief. Minutes after being given the responsibility,   drove down to the SP headquarters to take charge as the state president.
 
 The scene at the SP headquarters had also the signs of a “coup” as the office was surrounded by a posse of security personnel and paramilitary jawans who stood behind a steel barracading to counter any attempts of forced entry into the premises by the two sides. 
 
 UP minister   and spokesman in the state executive Deepak Misra had a tough time entering the premises and were allowed in only after due clearance from “inside”. There were reports that some youth also forcibly removed the name plates of Shivpal and other state unit office bearers from outside their respective office cabins at the party office.
