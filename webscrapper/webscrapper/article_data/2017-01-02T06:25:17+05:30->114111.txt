MUMBAI: Several   have come out with   featuring photos and   instead of the usual film stars or  . 

 Activist Abodh Aras of Welfare of Stray Dogs said they decided to have photos of rescued animals to spread awareness about joys of co-existing with animals. "There's a good demand for our desktop and wall-hanging calendars-a positive sign to continue with our mission in the new year," he said.
 
 Last year, reports of cruelty cases that made news included a puppy flung off a terrace, a monkey tortured to death by medical students, and horse Shaktiman being fatally attacked by a politician.
 
 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) India, which has published its calendar said it's a medium to reach out to people through happy animal stories. "Peta's 2017 calendar features 12 handsome animal portraits along with true stories of how the pictured animals were rescued and given a second chance to life," said Sachin Bangera.
 
 Activist   of Animals Matter To Me, which has brought out a pro-animal calendar this year, said they try to bring out positive stories of man-animal camaraderie through their calendars.
