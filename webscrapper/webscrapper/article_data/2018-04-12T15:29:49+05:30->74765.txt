Anjan Dutt, all geared up for his   release,  , is set to perform on 
  in what is been dubbed as the first-time 
  jamming by the music maker. Talking about the film, Dutt said, "Ami Ashbo Phirey is about songs, simple songs that leave us touched and thereby we end up feeling good, doing good, in whatever small way. That little good leads to more good unknowingly. Songs are a catalyst. The characters in the film don't even know who the singer is, but the songs change them unwittingly." Dutt will perform with son Neel, composer of the Swastika Mukherjee-Anjan Dutt-Kaushik Sen starrer in the city's party street — Park Street —
