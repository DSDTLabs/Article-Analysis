JAIPUR: Sleuths of   department on Sunday detained two persons for alleged smuggling of 300 grams of gold at the Jaipur airport. Both the passengers arrived from Dubai in the morning when they were detained. Officials were also checking the travel history of the passengers to find if they were indulging in the same activities earlier.

 
 Acting on a tip-off, the officials found two passengers with 300 grams of gold when they arrived in Jaipur from Dubai. The gold was seized by the officials and the passengers were released. â€œMany times international travellers who are either settled in Dubai or another country and are coming to India give declaration on how much gold they are carrying. After deducting various duties, their gold is handed over to them. However, in cases of smuggling, people usually conceal it and they are caught only when their baggage is checked.
 
 Earlier in March, one passenger was caught for illegal smuggling of 800 grams of gold at the Jaipur airport. The passenger came from   and he concealed gold in an axe.
