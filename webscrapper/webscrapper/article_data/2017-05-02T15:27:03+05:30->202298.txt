JAIPUR: In the last week of March, police stations across   were instructed to run a special drive to nab missing criminals. Harmada   in Jaipur took up the matter in right earnest, nabbing 110 people against whom warrants had earlier been issued. Much to the surprise of cops themselves, five of the missing criminals had been wearing long beards and dreadlocks, disguised as sadhus!

 There are 865 police stations in the state.   is the one that has made the largest number of ‘finds’ of absconding criminals in the one-month drive. Police at this station also managed to resolve 172 cases of theft in this interval.
 
 SHO Lakhan Khatana of Harmada police station said the credit for this should go principally to two young colleagues,   and Sunil Kumar, who went about in plainclothes on their motorbikes, gathering intelligence that the rest of the staff – a team of eight policemen – could act upon.
