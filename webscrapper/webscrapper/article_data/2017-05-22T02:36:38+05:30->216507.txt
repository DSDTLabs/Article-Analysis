MORADABAD: A day before the arrival of chief minister  , BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Moradabad,  , allegedly physically assaulted the general manger of Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India ( ) in Ratupura where the CM was to hold a programme on Sunday. 

 ALIMCO, a Kanpur-based public sector undertaking which is the largest manufacturer and supplier of rehabilitation aids in India, was to organise the event where the CM was to distribute tricycles to the disabled. The MP, who was supposedly unsatisfied with the company’s preparations, has denied the allegation.
 
 Miffed with the preparation work, Singh allegedly assaulted ALIMCO GM Ashok SN and his assistant Arun Mishra on Saturday.
 
 The duo approached police and submitted a written complaint against the MP and some   workers. The GM has also written to PM Narendra Modi and asked him to take action against the errant lawmaker. “Ashok SN visited the police station on Saturday evening and alleged that he was assaulted by   Thakur Sarvesh Singh and some BJP workers. 
 
 He submitted a written complaint and we have begun an inquiry into the matter,” Thakurdwara police station SHO Vinay Kumar said. “The MP was drunk. He along with partymen hit me with shoes on my face. I have sought an appointment with the PM to register my complaint,” Ashok SN told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, the MP refuted all allegations against him. “A contract of Rs 10 lakh was given to ALIMCO to organise the event. However, I found out that the preparations were not up to the mark. There was a minor scuffle between the GM and some party workers. However, nobody assaulted him,” Thakur Sarvesh Singh told TOI.
