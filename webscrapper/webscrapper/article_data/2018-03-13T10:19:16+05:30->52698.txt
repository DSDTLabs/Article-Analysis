LUCKNOW: The police appear to have a lackadaisical approach in cases pertaining to accidents caused by buses of   ( ), as is apparent from the delayed probe into last Thursday’s   at Burlington crossing which killed three people.

 The police are yet to conduct a technical inspection in the case, even as the bus driver got bail on Saturday due to lack of any evidence.
 
  
 This is not the first incident wherein police investigation of accidents pertaining to UPSRTC buses went on at a snail’s pace. As per police cell dossier, seven accidents have been caused by UPSRTC buses in the city causing 13 deaths in last eight months. However, there have neither been any arrests, nor any significant progress made in these cases. When TOI contacted the police stations where the cases were registered, the inspectors could give only lame excuses. While in one case the IO got transferred, in another, the driver of the bus which caused an accident in Kakori fled to Nepal.
 
 Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Lucknow, Deepak Kumar though said that investigation of the cases is underway. “It takes time in disposal of accident related cases because of legal hassles,” he said.
 
 On the Hussainganj bus accident, circle officer (COpolice lines), Chakresh Mishra told TOI that a technical inspection will be carried out by sub-inspector (motor terminal) from the police lines on Tuesday. “The incident is recreated on the stretch for a test under similar conditions,” said Mishra. At least seven days’ time is given for completing the inspection according to the rules, he added.
 
 The kin of the deceased, however, blame the authorities. Shahid, kin of Hamid who died in the Burlington accident, blamed the police and administration for the death of his brother.
