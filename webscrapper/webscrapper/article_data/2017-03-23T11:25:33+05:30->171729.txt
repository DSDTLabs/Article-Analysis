TRICHY:   by retailers is rampant at bus stands and tourist spots due to lack of a effective mechanism to redress grievances. The   department which is responsible for monitoring such irregularities, does not even have a toll-free number or a website. Besides, the mobile application announced a couple of years ago, to allow the public to register their complaints, is yet to see the light of day.

 “Most incidents related to fleecing go unreported because its a tedious process to file a complaint,” said Arjun Prasan, a city college student. If a retailer sells packaged food at a price above the maximum retail price, customers can file a complaint with the inspector of labour, Trichy. But, it’s difficult to access his number even if you do a goole search. Even if you somehow make it to the labour department office to lodge a complaint, you may have to give it in writing to expect some action against the retailer. 
 
 The mobile application Legal Metrology Complaint Tracking System (LMCTS), announced a couple of years ago, is yet to be launched. When contacted, labour department officials said they are training staff to use the application after which it would become functional.
 
 “I have been stressing on separating the inspectors of weights and measures from the labour department for over decades,” said S Pushpavanam, secretary,  , Tamil Nadu. This has hampered effective monitoring and surveillance of retailers selling packaged commodities, he said. When confronted with the inconvenience faced by customers, department officials said that such issues would be rectified at the earliest.
 
 “Unless there is improvement in personal awareness, real change pertaining to such issues cannot be achieved,” said M Sekaran, president,  . Admitting that there was’nt any exclusive toll free number or convenient way of reaching the concerned authorities, Sekaran suggested approaching the national consumer helpline, 1800-11-4000, on such issues, for prompt action.
