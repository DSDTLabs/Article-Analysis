PUNE: For the determined, challenges that life throws are but milestones on their way to success. The Class XII results have highlighted the names of several students who have beaten all odds.

 
 
  Shanbhag scored 95.6%. He is the second highest scorer in the science stream at the Orchid School-Baner. He has also cleared the IIT (Mains). The fact that Akshay has the Asperger’s syndrome may seem like a footnote, but the young man has had to be a fighter all his academic life. When he was in kindergarten, he was thrown out of the school. “The principal said I had ‘bad parenting skills’ and that my son ‘did not know anything’. We have faced a lot of problems, but they only made us stronger,” said Geeta Shanbhag, Akshay’s mother who now works as a teacher. After Class X he took admission into the Orchid School. “The teachers here are very encouraging. Since Class XI, he has been doing everything on his own. English is tough for him, but he scored well in that,” said the proud mother.
 
 
 
 At Orchid, Akshay is not the only one to have overcome learning issues to ace the exams. Three students with dyslexia — Shardul Pandit (75%),   (74.6%) and Tejaswin Pavitran (59.6%) — disproved their naysayers. “Language is hard for me as I always mess up spelling. But I am happy as I have scored 90 in English,” he said.
 
 
 
 Siddharth  , a student of DPS, was the victim of a hit-and-run case earlier this year. “The doctors had diagnosed poly-trauma with a hernia on my left flank. I had symptoms of kidney failure and had multiple blood clots. I spent 15 days in the ICU.” Sharma, who scored 86.4% and wants to be a lawyer, said, “The medication made me drowsy, but my mother was my pillar of strength.”
