New Delhi: JD(U) president and   appointed Sanjay Jha and Akhilesh Katiyar as national general secretaries, which is seen as an ambitious pan-India plan to expand the party, starting with a focus on gaining a foothold in Delhi where Bhojpuri speaking Bihari and eastern UP voters have emerged as a vote-bank.

 Jha’s appointment in Delhi holds significance as Nitish’s plan to launch the party in Delhi had turned dormant after he failed to forge an alliance with Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP even as the two leaders held meetings to explore alliance possibilities. In a tactical move, Nitish has appointed Jha as Delhi in-charge just ahead of civic polls. 
 
 Sources said JD(U) sees an opportunity amid reports of resentment among Bihari and eastern UP migrants in Delhi against AAP. 
 
 BJP recently appointed Bhojpuri singer and east Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari as Delhi president eyeing the Poorvanchali vote. Since local body polls are round the corner in Delhi, Jha will be instrumental in selection of candidates.
 
 Jha was instrumental in organising rallies in the past few years, including the one in which Nitish had demanded full statehood to Delhi.
 
 Interestingly, Akhilesh Katiyar is the national general secretary of the Patidar Navnirman Sena headed by rebel leader Hardik Patel. 
 
  The plan to revive JD(U) in Delhi is significant as Nitish had once partnered with Kejriwal against the PM. 
 
 However, the JD(U) boss’s interest in Delhi could be a major jolt to the AAP.
