Vadodara: Lawyers finally began work in the new district court on Monday after calling off their hunger strike and agitation over the issue of seating arrangement. However, they continued to protest in a unique way by sitting on floor until the joint committee of five senior advocates and five judges of Gujarat high court comes up with a permanent solution of seating arrangement.

 Meanwhile, the committee of five senior advocates that was appointed during the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) held on Friday was handed the copy of resolution of their appointments and their functions along with a forwarding letter addressed to the high court.
 
 As it was decided during EGM that lawyers will sit on floor, several lawyers had brought mats with them from home and were seen sitting in the lobby of the main building. 
 
 The Baroda Bar Association (BBA) locked the annexe building which was meant to be used by advocates and handed over the keys to the district judge. Along with the lawyers, their clients too had no option but to squat on the floor.
 
 According to the resolution, the representative committee which includes senior advocates Atul Mehta, Niramay Parikh, Kaushik Bhatt, Shailesh Patel and Bhumika Trivedi will discuss about the issue of seating arrangement and other facilities for lawyers. Also, the decision which the committee will take after discussion along with the committee of high court judges regarding the interim arrangement and permanent arrangement, will be binding on all lawyers.
 
 Another committee consisting of Dilip Nanavati, Vijay Shirke, Snehal Shah, Narendra Parmar and Sajid Gajiawala for table allotment and forming rules for allotment was also constituted.
