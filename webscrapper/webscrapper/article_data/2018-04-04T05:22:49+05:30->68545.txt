NEW DELHI: As opposition parties questioned   over the Supreme Court verdict doing away with automatic arrest under the SC/ST Act, the party is looking to wrest back its Dalit outreach with Ambedkar-centric events planned around the birth anniversary celebrations of the Dalit icon on April 14.

 PM   will lead another commemoration of the community's tallest icon for the Alipur Road memorial in Delhi on Ambedkar Jayanti. Before the Delhi event, Modi will inaugurate a memorial where the Dalit icon breathed his last in Mumbai. The inauguration will come in the backdrop of fresh unrest in the Dalit community following the SC's directive to ban mandatory arrest under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
 
 Ambedkar has been at the heart of a saffron bid to accommodate his legacy within its political narrative for the Modi government. BJP had put construction of five memorials on fast track after coming to power, planning it as a strong outreach to the massive voting bloc.
 
 BJP's bid to win over the Dalit community is complemented by RSS's outreach efforts like 'one village, one well and one temple' campaign. RSS chief   has been consistent about elevating   in the Hindu social hierarchy.
