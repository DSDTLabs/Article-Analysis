COIMBATORE: Two   depicting   between   have been retrieved from  . Thought that the artefacts were excavated three decades ago, they were later abandoned and lost among the shrubs around the lake. 

 Environmentalists and nature conservation activists, who conducted a cleaning drive at the lake recently, spotted the tablets. They informed a group of amateur archaeologists, who work towards identifying and preserving artefacts of historical significance. A member of this group, S Anand Kumar, said, "Though the tablets were unearthed around 30 years ago, they were abandoned by the locals and over a period of time, trees and shrubs covered them." 
 
 The tablets have engravings that throw light into the trade relations of the 13th century kingdom. "They have been engraved with an antennae sword and a camel, depicting the trade relationship between Rome and the Kongu region," Anand Kumar said. Traders from Rome sold camels and horses to Pandyas for muslin and jewellery, especially the famous pearls from the Gulf of Mannar, said the volunteer. 
 
 This is not the first time such artefacts were found in this region. "Many such artefacts were found in Thondamuthur, Vellalore and Perur areas. Romans used the route to reach Kaveripattinam through Noyyal River," said Anand Kumar.
 
 The tablets have been handed over to residents of Perur, who have promised to take care of them till they find a permanent home. "After we told them about the importance of the artefacts, the locals have promised to preserve them. We hope the Archaeological Survey of India will be interested in them," Anand Kumar added.
