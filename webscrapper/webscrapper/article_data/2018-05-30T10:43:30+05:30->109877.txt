BENGALURU: Following a clutch of impressive performances on the LPGA,   would have been tempted to keep the momentum going. But the 20-yearold, who played seven weeks on the trot, felt she needed to take a break, brush up her game.

 
 “I think I would have been able to continue, considering I have played both those courses (in Virginia and Michigan),” said Aditi, who had a splendid tied sixth-place finish at the Texas Classic early this month. “It would have been a good idea but I felt like I needed to take a break and practise. Sometimes we tend to get carried away when you are playing well and feel like you can keep going but you don’t end up putting in the same amount of practice that you would put in an off week.”
 
 Aditi had two equally good weeks (including a tied seventh-place finish in California) prior to her Texas show, where she even held the clubhouse lead on the final day. “In an off-week I would hit at least 100 to 150 balls every day, I would play 9 to 18 holes, practise my short game. All that never really happens in a tournament week,” said Aditi.
