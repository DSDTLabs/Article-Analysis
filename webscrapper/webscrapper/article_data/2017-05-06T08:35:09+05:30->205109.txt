PANAJI: The   department has been receiving thousands of calls on its   after it was integrated with the   No. 112. Though very few calls are SOS (save our souls) requests, most are made unknowingly and unintentionally by   by pressing the panic button option provided on smartphones post-Nirbhaya incident.

 Speaking to mediapersons, deputy inspector general of police (DIG),   said that on an average Goa police receive around 25,000 accidental calls per day, due to which the helpline remains engaged and people actually in distress find themselves in a piquant situation.
 
 “Unknowingly pressing the panic button, a call goes to the national emergency response number which is integrated with Goa’s helpline. This leads to an increase in the number of calls made on the state helpline,’’ he said, adding, “On many occasions people remain unaware that they have pressed the panic button with no corresponding message to the police control room.’’
 
 “As the cell phone remains in the connected mode for a while once the button is pressed, others who are in distress are deprived of the helpline facility,’’ Kumar said, adding, “The department has identified some of the frequent callers and soon an awareness would be created among them about this service.’’
 
 “In view of the inconvenience caused to genuine callers, the department has temporarily increased the number of telephone lines linked to the state police control room to 30 from the existing seven. But this is not the solution unless there is awareness among the people,’’ he said.
 
 Kumar also appealed to the cell phone users to exercise caution on panic button option as otherwise the helpline would remain engaged and deprive others of the service.
