Bollywood celebs are known for their love for animals. When it comes to canine love, our stars really go all out and their dogs live as luxuriously as their owners and are truly spoilt. 

 Bollywood   Mohan is no less when it comes to her eight-year-old beagle dog named Frodo. There’s a special bond shared between   and his master and   calls it the musical bond between them. 
 
 Whenever Frodo feels low, Neeti sings for her baby and he calms down. Talking about her beloved pet Neeti says, “He brings a certain joy to our lives and bring a smile on our faces on a daily basis. He is my family. He is always there to cheer me up and give me company, when the chips are down.” 
 
 The singer is quite attached to her dog and cannot wait to get back to him after work.
