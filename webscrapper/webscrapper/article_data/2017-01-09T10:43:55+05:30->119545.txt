MUMBAI: With   expressing its inability to host next month's   games against their   counterparts, former India captain   feels these matches should be shifted and hosted in this metropolis.

 "As a former captain of India, I feel that if   is unable to host the Under-19 games against England, Mumbai can host it as it has more international venues than any other city in India," the ex-chief selector told PTI today.
 
 TNCA has cited cyclone Vardah, its after-effects and its own domestic cricket schedule as reasons for it not having sufficient fit-enough grounds to host the games against England for a fortnight at the M A Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk.
 
 Vengsarkar, who played 116 Tests for India and has the distinction of scoring three back-to-back hundred as at Lord's in England, also wanted Mumbai as the reserve venue if Hyderabad CA is unable to hold the one-off India-Bangladesh Test match, which is also scheduled in February, for any reason.
 
 "Besides, Mumbai also could be counted as the back-up venue for the India - Bangladesh Test match if Hyderabad which is the original venue declines to host it," said the former skipper.
 
 "I believe cricket should always be the priority. These matches are scheduled a long time ago and hosting them shouldn't be a problem at all," Vengsarkar added.
