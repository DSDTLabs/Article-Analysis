MARGAO:   Congress MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco has alleged sabotage in the affairs of the Goa Medical College ( ) in the matter pertaining to the   facility in the government-owned hospital. 

 Addressing mediapersons on Monday, Lourenco accused the bureaucracy, particularly the health secretary, of attempting to transfer the organ transplant facility at the GMC to a private hospital. Demanding that the health minister   intervene in the matter and restart the organ transplant facility at the GMC, Lourenco warned of taking the legal route if the government failed to stop the “biggest   in the making” forthwith. He assured the government of the opposition’s support over the issue.
 
  Instead of promoting the Goa medical college as a regional organ transplant centre, some bureaucrats are sabotaging efforts to serve private interest, the Curtorim MLA alleged.
