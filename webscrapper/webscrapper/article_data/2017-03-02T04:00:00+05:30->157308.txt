Vadodara: High drama was witnessed outside Nyay Mandir on Wednesday afternoon when some Youth Congress workers splashed blank ink at Vinod alias Bharat Savant, an accomplice of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth’s president Mansukh Shah, who arrested for running cash-for-marks racket.

 The Congress members had planned to throw ink at Shah as soon as would be brought out pf court after his remand procedures end. But cops quietly whisked him from other gate. Youth congress worker Jitendra Solanki alias Pappu had announced that they would be throwing ink at Shah. Police personnel and several intelligence bureau sleuths had put up a watch in civil dress outside the court room of principal district and sessions judge J C Doshi to avoid any untoward incident. After the court delivered the final remand order, the cops took Shah to the office of the registrar to sign some papers. 
 
 On other hand, another police team took Savant out of the court premises from gate 7 where Youth Congress workers were already waiting for them. 
 
 Around 15 rushed towards cops and Savant, showed black flags and threw black ink at them. Along with Savant, the ink thrown by the workers fell on several policemen, onlookers and media persons. 
 
 The police detained three persons including Solanki and took them to Raopura police station.
 
 “People like Shah have brought a great disrepute to education by demanding bribes from students.,” said Ashfaque Malik, Youth Congress worker and an advocate, who was one of 15 workers who threw ink at Savant near the court.
