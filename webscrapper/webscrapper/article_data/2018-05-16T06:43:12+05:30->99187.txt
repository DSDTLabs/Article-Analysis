AHMEDABAD: CID (crime) on Tuesday moved a plea before a local court asking it to issue an an arrest warrant against former   MLA  , in connection with the sensational   case. The agency submitted that Kotadiya, “a politically influential person”, was not honouring summons and was evading arrest in a kidnapping and extortion case. CID also submitted that the former BJP MLA played a significant role in the crime and hence, “needed to be arrested”.

 
 Kotadiya, the former MLA from Dhari in Amreli district, is accused in the Bitcoin (cryptocurrency) extortion case in which several police officials, including a superintendent of police and an inspector of the local crime branch, have been arrested.
 
 Sessions judge P   concluded the hearing on the application and reserved the order for Thursday. CID told the court that it had issued summonses to Kotadiya under section 160 of CrPC, asking him to appear before it on two occasions, but he had failed to do so.
 
 “Police teams have not been able to find Kotadiya, despite going to his residence and a place where he was believed to be hiding at. On May 7, Kotadiya had sent the agency a fax stating that he would appear before them on May 12 but did not do so,” the application moved by A A Syed, deputy superintendent of CID said.
 
 “We have concrete evidence against Kotadiya. He is a politically influential person. His evading arrest could be an attempt to delay and create hindrance in the investigation,” the plea said.
 
 “With a warrant under section 70 of the CrPC, CID (crime) can notify   police and other agencies and seek help from police and investigating agencies from outside the state to find and arrest Kotadiya,” the CID submitted. An FIR was lodged against the accused on a complaint filed with the CID (crime) three months ago by Shailesh Bhatt, a Surat-based builder .
