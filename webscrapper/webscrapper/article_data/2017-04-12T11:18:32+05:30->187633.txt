PUNE: Around   in   in   when fire broke out on Tuesday morning. 

 There was no report of any loss of life or injuries.
 
 The fire erupted in one hutment and quickly spread to other huts.
 
 Fire tenders failed to reach the spot due to narrow roads. Fire station duty officer   told TOI that fire tenders could not go beyond the   police chowky. "We laid pipes to cover the distance of about 150 feet and then started the relief operation," he said. 
 
 Sonawane said that six huts were gutted completely while two to three others were partially damaged. "We requested the residents to shift cooking gas cylinders as we feared that the fire would spread quickly," he said.
 
 However, six cylinders exploded, causing panic among local residents.
 
 The fire brigade received the emergency call at 10.26am, while the fire was doused around 11.15am.
 
 Swajval Jogdand, a 62-year-old woman, told TOI that she and her grandchildren were having tea in front of their house when she heard some noises inside her house. "Before I could realise anything, flames engulfed the house," Jogdand said.
 
 Jogdand said that her son and other family members were out when the incident occurred. "The fire started from my house but I don't know how it broke out," she said.
 
 Her neighbour, Jaya Baswant, said that her daughter was at school while her husband had gone out for work. "I work as a house help and had gone to work when the fire broke out. I lost everything in the fire," she said.
 
 Sonawane said the fire broke out due to a short circuit in Jogdand's house.
