NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday adopted a   against the Union cabinet’s decision to allow   in retail. It opposed by saying that FDI in   will lead to economic slavery of the country and will also break the backbone of small and medium traders.

 The resolution, moved by AAP MLA Somnath Bharti, was adopted by voice votes on the last day of the winter session of the assembly.
 
 The house strongly opposed the government decision to allow 100% FDI, with labour minister Gopal Rai alleging that the “FDI was being used to by BJP leaders to turn their black money into white money.”
 
 The resolution was adopted after a short discussion on the issue, where AAP legislators accused the Narendra Modi government of “selling the country to foreign powers.” Rai said that most of the developed countries did not require FDI to boost their economy and yet became economic powers.
 
 “India does not need FDI. The country has enough resources for economic growth. More than FDI, we need to better utilise the resources and talent the country has,” he said.
 
 Bharti claimed that the FDI will come from countries that are considered tax havens, thus allowing people who have stashed black money abroad to utilise it in FDI. MLA Saurab Bharadwaj said that he wondered what led the BJP to agree for 100% FDI, as its functionaries conflicted it when they were in opposition.
 
 Leader of opposition Vijender Gupta however said that FDI in retail will boost jobs creation and provide farmers the opportunity to sell their goods to big corporates at better prices.
 
 Urban development minister Satyender Jain said FDI in defence and aviation is understandable but not in retail. “Small shops are being sealed and on the other hand FDI is being allowed. The purpose is to promote big international brands at the cost of small traders,” he said.
