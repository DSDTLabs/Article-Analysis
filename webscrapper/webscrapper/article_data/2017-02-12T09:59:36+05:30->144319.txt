Kolhapur zilla parishad’s chief executive officer (CEO)   last week ordered an inquiry into the alleged discrepancies of secondary education officer Jyotsana Shinde’s work.

 A ZP official said that many schools across the district complained against Shinde for using her position for personal benefits. Shinde had joined the secondary education office in 2014. Additional CEO Indrajit Deshmukh has also been appointed as the inquiry officer for the issue.
 
 Khemnar said, “I have initiated an inquiry against the secondary education officer on various complaints I received against her. Additional CEO has also been made an inquiry officer and will submit his report within 10 days. This report will be submitted to the education commissioner for further action.”
 
 The inquiry order, a copy of which is with the TOI, refers to 11 education institutes or individuals associated with academic institutions across the district with complaints against Shinde.
 
 Rohit Madhale, whose father retired from the   and   from Kaulav village in Radhanagari taluka alleged that because of Shinde’s arrogance, his father could not get post-retirement benefits on time.
 
 “We had to file a complaint against her, as she was never available despite several visits to the secondary education office,” he said.
 
 After the demonetisation announcement in November last year, the   (ACB) sleuths had caught a ZP clerk working with the education department red-handed while accepting a Rs 35,000 bribe in 17 new notes of Rs 2,000 denomination and 10 notes of Rs 100.
 
 After this incident, ZP CEO Khemnar ordered an inquiry into all departments in November. Altogether, 11 individuals associated with the department were slapped show-cause notices back then.
 
 Jyotsna Shinde could not be reached despite several attempts made to contact her.
