PANAJI: Investigation into the Vinayak Karbotkar murder case seems to be in a state of limbo, as those accused of his murder alleged that the   are responsible for  , while police have told the crime branch that jail inmates have killed Karbotkar.

 Late night on January 24, murder accused Karbotkar was killed at Sada sub jail, Vasco, following a fight that broke out between two groups of inmates. Some inmates were injured in the clash. 
 
 Police investigating the case are clueless about the inmates who were actually involved in the fight. 
 
 With no inroads into narrowing down on the accused, crime branch SP Umesh Gaonkar had asked the entire crime branch team to focus on the Karbotkar case.
 
 In February, the state government transferred the murder case to the crime branch of Goa police, which has so far recorded the statement of 30 inmates, 30 police personnel and 15 prison staff, as part of its investigation. 
 
 A crime branch senior officer told TOI that both jail inmates and police personnel are blaming each other for the murder. 
 
 Police said that as the   cameras were damaged and there was no hard disk to store the CCTV footage, it has become difficult for them to trace the accused in the case.
 
 Karbotkar was facing trial in over 10 criminal cases. Six months ago, Karbotkar was slapped with a murder charge for killing history-sheeter Ashpak Bengre, while both were lodged at central jail, Colvale. After the murder, the 27-year-old was shifted to Sada sub-jail.
 
 The postmortem examination of Karbotkar’s body revealed that he died of “haemorrhage and shock” as a result of combined multiple body injuries caused by a blunt object, hinting that a stick was used in the act of murder.
