AHMEDABAD : Following the  , when vehicle numbers surged three times that of previous year, and went up by 1.15 lakh, city planners had one seemingly obvious solution: build more and wider roads. Unfortunately, it didn’t work. The vehicular population of the city is growing at a rate up to 15% each year, forcing the   (AMC) to   and underpasses.

 Researchers from the department of civil engineering, L D College, and KSV University, conducted a study to evaluate traffic congestion at six important intersections in Ahmedabad. They even measured the peak saturation flow of traffic — a study which describes the number of passenger car units (pcu) in a dense flow of traffic for a specific intersection lane group — at these junctions.
 
 In CG road, if the observed capacity was 5,000 PCUs, the peak saturation flow was calculated to be 7,751 PCUs. Similarly for the   stretch if the observed capacity is 4,700 PCUs per hour, the peak saturation flow was calculated to be 8,369 PCUs per hour. The study clearly shows how each road hits its maximum carrying capacity during peak hours.
 
 The study found that if the observed capacity of a road like Manav Mandir to Gurukul was 4,400 PCUs per hour in one direction, the peak saturation flow on this stretch increased to 10,565 PCUs.
 
 A senior AMC traffic consultant said, “If the density of an average US city is 15 to 10 people per hectare, in India it is 150 people per hectare. When it comes to cities, this land availability gets smaller. In US and European cities, each citizen gets 3 to 4 metres of space, while in Ahmedabad it is 0.8 to 0.9 metres. For Indian cities, it becomes important for public transport to be promoted,” said the traffic consultant. He added that Ahmedabad has a density of 45 to 50 cars per 1,000 people today.
