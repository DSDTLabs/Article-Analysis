GOLD COAST: From tilling farmland in order to help his dad in   to lifting the silver medal on his debut at the Commonwealth Games, Punjab's   believes he made his late grandfather proud on Monday.

 
 
 
 
 "My grandfather passed away when I was very young but I have heard all the stories about him from my dad. He was a popular pehalwan - Harwan Singh - in Jalandhar and he won lots of prizes. My dad was also a bit into weightlifting, so he wanted me to become a weightlifter too," Singh, who tips the scale at 105 kg plus, told TOI on Monday. The 23-year-old was in sight of the gold medal till the very end but a critical overrule by the jury saw him slip into the second spot and settle for silver behind Samoa's Sanele Mao. Mao lifted a total of 360 kg (154 in snatch and 206 in clean and jerk) while Singh ended with 352 (152+100).   of England took the bronze at 351 kg (152 + 200).
 
 "The judges had passed my lift but the jury didn't agree and called it a no lift. All the three referees said good lift but the jury said my elbow was not straight. We are not going to protest as I feel there was a mistake on my part," Singh said. Had he made that lift of 211 kg, he would have ended with the gold with a haul of 363 kilos. It was the second silver for India from the weightlifters and they returned with a total of five gold, two silvers and two bronze.
 
 "I was hopeful that if I do well, I will win a medal. I'm glad that I did that. I'm not disappointed at missing out on the gold. Someone has to lose. At the last Commonwealth Championships here I had defeated him to win gold, but today he won," the Indian said.
