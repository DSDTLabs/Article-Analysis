 Saddam, who was known to be a good swimmer, had drowned in waters of Tinchha Falls in 2012. Salim claimed that he approached Simrol police station officers seeking a probe into the death. “I had even pleaded before the district administration seeking a probe by the tehsildar, but no action was taken,” he said.
 
 When a crestfallen family was brooding the death, one   approached them raising suspicion over the conditions that led to Saddam's demise, Salim said.
 
 “We were shattered. Annu Patel promised us to help initiate a CBI probe into the death by using his contacts as a reporter,” he said.
 
 The accused gained confidence of the family and in separate installments, took Rs 18 lakh from Salim.
 
 “I gave him my entire life’s earnings. I even borrowed money from my relatives and daughter,” he said.
 
 When nothing transpired over the years, Salim asked him to return the money. Annu returned Rs 8.52 lakh, said Salim in the complaint, adding he then started threatening the family of dire consequences if they further pressurized him to repay the money.
 
 DIG Mishra told TOI that the matter has been handed over to the Khajrana police for investigation. “Appropriate action will be taken,” he added.
