A copy of the proclamation was formally handed over to Alok Madasani, Kuchibhotla's colleague who was injured in the hate crime. American Ian Grillot who came to the rescue of the two Indians also suffered bullet injuries when accused Adam Purinton attacked them. Both Alok and Ian were honoured by Brownback at the ceremony. 
 
 Speaking about Dumala, who returned to India, Brownback said, "She needs to be allowed to stay in the US and we will be working to assist her in staying in the US." Madasani joined work on March 13.
 
 "We welcome all Indians who wish to come to Kansas to live, work and raise a family. And we thank them for contributing to our state's prosperity" the governor said. Describing the shooting incident as an 'evil act', Brownback said the gathering was to commemorate the life of Kuchibhotla and honour Madasani and the heroism of Ian Grillot. 
 
 Speaking of Grillot, he said, "His actions represent the very best of our region. The senseless violent actions of one man will not divide or define the state of Kansas. These actions cannot overshadow our shared values and beliefs and the dignity of mankind and everybody."
