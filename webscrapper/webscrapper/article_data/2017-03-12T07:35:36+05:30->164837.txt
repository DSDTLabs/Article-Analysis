THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   said the results of assembly polls conducted in five states point to strong anti-incumbency sentiments among the voters. Refusing to give credit to the  , Vijayan said it needed to be seen whether the party's achievements in the assembly elections were on par with the last   elections. The chief minister shared his quick comments with reporters at Kochi before the entire results came out. 

 Former chief minister and administrative reforms commission chairman   said the results will only embolden Prime Minister   to continue displaying autocratic and fascist tendencies "The results point to impending crisis for the country and calls for the strengthening of Left and secular forces," VS said in a statement here.
 
 "The BJP ensured the win by splitting secular votes, playing communal cards and misusing the power at the centre. The difference of opinion among secular forces made things easier for the saffron outfit," said VS. He said the victory should not be seen as an endorsement for Modi's policies, including demonetisation. VS warned that the results will help BJP gain a upper hand in the Rajya Sabha as well. "If the party get control over the Rajya Sabha, Modi may go to any extend," he said.
