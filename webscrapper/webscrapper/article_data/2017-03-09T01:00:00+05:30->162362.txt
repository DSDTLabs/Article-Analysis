 Traditional Indian curries are best when paired with red rice. Luke says, “For example in Goa, the traditional Gaon fish curry tastes best with red rice. Vegetable stews also go well with red rice. You can make a cold or hot salad with it as well. Cooked red rice with added raw veggies for crunch, served cold or warm, enhances its flavours all the more.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Red vegetable pot rice serves as a healthy option compared to white rice. You will need one tablespoon olive oil, two de-seeded peppers, minced garlic cloves, mushrooms, one cup of red rice, salt to taste, spring onions, one cup of sprouts and coriander leaves for garnishing, your choice of spices and two and a half to three cups of vegetable broth. 
 You need to rinse the rice and keep it in a large bowl with enough water and let it soak for 30 minutes. Now, drain and set it aside. In a pan, heat a little bit of olive oil and saute the garlic until it is soft. Now add finely chopped mushrooms and spring onions and let it saute for some time till it turns golden. Next add the red rice in the pan along with spices and add a pinch of salt and the vegetable broth, while you stir all the ingredients properly. 
 Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Once you turn the heat, simmer the rice until it gets soft and thoroughly cooked. Garnish with coriander leaves and sprouts and serve hot.
