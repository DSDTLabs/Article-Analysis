BENGALURU: Highly placed sources in the   (SIT) probing the murder of   on Saturday said they didn't come across any   over the past one year. The SIT is cross-checking 650 unlisted calls made to the slain journalist, both on her mobile and landlines at home and office. “We have contacted almost all the numbers and spoken to the people on the other side. But we haven't come across anything unusual,“ sources added.

 “Even Gauri's close friends, family members and colleagues don't remember her getting threat calls, letters or emails. A few days before her murder, Gauri had told her mother that she had seen a stranger loitering near her house. But neither Gauri nor her family members took it seriously,“ SIT sources said.
