CHENNAI : Head constable Parameshwaran, who was arrested in Trichy while he was trying to sell  , has told police that he had been smuggling   from places like Jharkhand and Bihar, and selling them to businessmen and realtors in   for more than four years. Parameshwaran, who has been suspended, told police that he has sold at least six pistols to businessmen and a lawyer based in Coimbatore, after smuggling the arms from   by train.

 A police officer, examining the seized pistols said, “These pistols are made by small-scale producers from Jharkhand and Bihar. Though these crude arms may not hit the target, they might pose a danger if fired at point-blank range.” Police said the man had been placed under suspension earlier for creating a ruckus at the   police station.
