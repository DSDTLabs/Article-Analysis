PATNA: Dilip Singh, a Bihar Police   said to be mentally unstable, shot his colleague Rajendra Singh’s 22-year-old son Deepak Kumar Singh while he was asleep with a self-loading rifle at a   quarter at Lodipur in Patna around 7am on Tuesday.

 According to police, Deepak’s father is a driver constable posted at Aghamkuan police station. The deceased’s elder brother, Ashu Kumar, was also recently recruited as a driver constable. Dilip’s sister is married to Ashu.
 
 Police said Dilip, who joined police in 1999, had been under the treatment of a Kankerbagh psychiatrist ever since his 12-year-old son died in a road accident three years ago. 
 
 SI Z Khan, who is Rajendra’s neighbour at Police Lines, told TOI when he came out of his home soon after hearing the fireshot, Ashu was trying to overpower Dilip. “I also helped Ashu, but Dilip jumped off the first floor and fled,” Khan said.
 
 Even as neighbours gathered outside the bereaved family’s quarter, Dilip retuned and again fired. The bullet hit the ceiling, Khan said.
 
 “Dilip used to live in a temporary shelter below my quarter and used to have his meals at my home,” Rajendra said and added even on Tuesday morning just before leaving for duty, he had come asking for tea from Ashu’s wife.
 
 Rajendra said as soon as his daughter-in-law went inside to prepare tea, Dilip shot Deepak in head.
 
 DSP (law and order) Shibli Nomani said the incident took place soon after Dilip was handed over the rifle and ammunition for duty. “Investigations are on,” the DSP said and added Dilip was later overpowered at the Police Lines itself by havildar Suresh Prasad who also snatched the rifle from him.
