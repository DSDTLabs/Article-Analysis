In a country as diverse as India, with an overwhelming population of 1.7 billion people, being talented does not really make the cut. With varied interests and preferences, the Indian audiences have proven to be a difficult nut to track. 

 Radhika Mukherjee, CEO and Co-Founder,  , is looking at bridging this gap, with the integrated solutions provided by her company that are tailored to suit everyone's musical and entertainment needs. She says, 'The trick is to connect the right artiste with the right audience and we surely are on the road to master this.' Radhika believes that a talented artiste becomes a star, only after finding the right audience. 
 
 She adds, 'We aspire to cater to all entertainment needs, revolutionising the music and entertainment industry nationally. Right from a single consumer, to corporate and large-scale events, Happydemic's diversified knowledge of the Indian entertainment sector enables us to deliver the right solutions.'
