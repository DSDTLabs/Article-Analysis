HYDERABAD: Caught in a dilemma over whether or not to construct central medians at areas where the Metro viaduct deviates from the main road, the   ( ) has now sought advise from the special committee formed to look into the issue of `critical metro pillars'.

 There at least 25 such locations along the three metro corridors where the metro viaduct goes off the road, there are varying view points on whether a central median should be constructed.
 
 The committee formed by the Metro rail authorities is currently inspecting the 198 locations where metro pillars have been earmarked as `dangerous' by traffic cops, and suggesting correc tive measures. The committee includes independent transportation experts, representatives of traffic police from Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda, traffic experts from the   municipal corporation (GHMC) and the Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL).
 
 At several locations like Parade grounds, Begumpet near Manohar Hotel, Bharathnagar and Paradise the metro viaduct does not have a straight alignment with the main road. Due to existing flyovers at such locations, the metro viaduct had to be shifted to either side of the road.
 
 “We have asked the committee to thoroughly exami ne the places where the viaduct goes off the main road and suggest whether a central median should be put up or not, or if any other measures should be taken. As per some experts a central median could result in traffic jams during peak hours while as per others not having a central median could mean danger during off peak hours. It could result in accidents,“ said  , chief, HMRL.
 
 As per the original plan, along all the three metro corridors, the metro rail authorities will complete central medians, pedestrian islands, roundabouts, under street-scaping, parking facilities and beautification plan for the roads.
