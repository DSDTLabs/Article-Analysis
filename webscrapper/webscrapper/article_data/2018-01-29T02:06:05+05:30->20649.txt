Trichy: Though awareness towards learning martial arts has been steadily increasing in Trichy, the number of women practitioners is still considerably less compared to their male counterparts.

 This was evident at the 2018 South Zone India Taekwondo Championship held in the city on January 27 and 28, in which female participants made for only 1/4th of the total participants. The tournament was organised by Industan Sports Taekwondo Academy (INSTA) at Jamal Mohamed College. Member of Parliament (MP) P Kumar was invited as the chief guest for the inaugural ceremony.
 
 It’s a welcome sign that people in the city are taking martial arts more seriously, but women are still hesitant to take it up, said INSTA’s secretary and taekwondo championship organiser Julesh Kumar. “Women are not getting into martial arts because they are not exactly aware about it. Many think martial art means only karate. But a tournament of this scale is a first-of-its-kind in the city, so we can expect young girls and women to soon consider mastering a self- defence technique,” he told TOI. Kumar also emphasised that more young girls and boys should learn taekwondo because it is a part of Olympic Games.
 
 The total number of participants in the championship was more than 250, while the women participants accounted for only around 65.
 
 One of the tournament officials, Mahalakshmi, stated that it is a must for women to learn martial arts, considering the amount of crime that has been happening against them. “They (women) do not learn martial arts because they are not allowed to. Parents are scared to send their daughters to such classes,”she said.
