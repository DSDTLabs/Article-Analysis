 Trichy: Road widening work in Thuvakudi area which began following the eviction of encroachers was stalled after residents in the area blocked the road on Wednesday alleging that the encroachments were not properly removed. 
 
 A group of villagers in the area blocked the road in VOC Colony after officials began widening the road in some parts of the stretch from Anna arch in Thuvakudi to VOC Colony. The places identified for the widening project were occupied by the residents by constructing houses in violation of the norms.
 
 Revenue officials had carried out the eviction drive on September 14 following an order of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. They removed the compound wall, platform and sun shades of 32 houses on the stretch from Anna arch to VOC Colony. In the case filed by residents of nine villages in Thiruverumbur area, the court ordered the removal of the encroachments a year back. However, officials failed to obey the order following which the villagers moved a contempt petition in the court which pulled up the officials and ordered to clear the encroachments and to file a report on September 18.
 
 The latest issue cropped up on Wednesday after the villagers demanded to remove the encroachments on the land owned by National Institute of Technology (NIT). However, officials were clueless as they were unable to act on the encroachment by the NIT. 
 
 “We evicted the encroachment on the entire stretch based on the court order. So, we decided to widen the road. But the villagers demanded to remove the encroachment in the land of Regional Engineering College (now NIT). Without the concurrence of the institution, we cannot act on it,” said tahsildar of Thiruverumbur taluk, A Shoba. 
 
 Meanwhile, as traffic was disrupted due to the road   for more than an hour, officials decided to hold a meeting with the protesters to find out a solution.
