HYDERABAD: Along with implementing hi-tech security and ticketing techniques, GMR   Ltd (GHIAL) authorities are also taking up green initiatives at the expansive premises. In its latest move,   has enhanced the capacity of its in-house ' ' by 30% to 'organically' maintain the sprawling 300 hectares of green space dotting the airport's periphery.

 The initiative, touted to be the first of its kind in airports across India, is in line with the 2016 Civil Aviation Policy that mandates all airports to have their own waste management facilities for solid and liquid waste. Spread over one acre, the plant was initially built in 2010 with the objective of effectively managing waste generated at the airport every day. SG K Kishore, CEO of GHIAL said, “It is one of the many significant environment protection initiatives that we have undertaken with a focus on maintaining the vital ecological balance at the airport. We have been able to meet 50% of our fertilizer requirement by using organic manure produced at our composting plant.“
 
 The initiative has been lauded by environmentalists. “It's an eco-friendly way of managing food waste by converting it into compost. The method ensures there is no foul odour and is worth emulating,“ said prof A Srinivas, principal scientist (Agro) and head at Professor Jayashankar Telangana  . The project was set up following clearances from   to cut down on use of chemical fertilizers at the facility.
