CHENNAI: Saturday is an auspicious day for Lord Vishnu devotees. And many devotees thronged the   Information Centre at   in Chennai on Saturday morning to have darshan of Lord Venkateswara at a temple on the premises. However, to their disappointment, the temple remained closed.

 Inquiries revealed that the temple was closed as officials wanted to purify the premises after the visit of a nude   and his half-nude disciples on Friday.
 
 The visit of the Naga sadhu caught the information centre officials unawares, and the local committee of the centre decided to purify the place before opening it for darshan.
 
 "As per Vaishnavite tradition we had to purify the area and do a pooja before opening it to devotees. It was unusual for Naga sadhus, who are Shiva devotees, to visit the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam centre here," said   official not willing to be named.
 
 The Naga sadhu and his disciples came from Varanasi on a pilgrimage to Tamil Nadu. 
 
 Devotees, who were regular visitors to the TTD centre, returned disappointed as they could not have darshan of Venkateswara.
 
 "I used to visit the centre on Saturday around 8am, but the temple was not open yesterday. When enquired, officials said due to the visit of Naga sadhus, the temple was being purified. This is as per the Vaishnavite custom," said M Srimathi, a resident of T Nagar.
