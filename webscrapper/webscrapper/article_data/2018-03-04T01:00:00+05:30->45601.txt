But at least we had you.”
 
 Referring to the actress as her ‘best friend’, she wrote, “My friends always said I’m perpetually happy, and now I realise it was because of you. ‘I didn’t have to rely on anyone or anything because the only person I ever needed was you. You are part of my soul. My best friend. My reason for everything.”
