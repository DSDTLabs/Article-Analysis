NEW DELHI: The world faces a new abnormal, where past certainties provide little guidance to the future, Times Group MD Vineet Jain said on Monday .
Addressing the third  , Jain said some of the world's major economies appear to have developed doubts about the wisdom of globlalisation.The free flow of goods and services, and people, is being questioned. These could impact some of India's outward-looking businesses.
 
 Indian policy-makers see the wisdom of reforms.This is because India needs to grow at least at 7-8% for several years -not just for the sake of businessmen, but also for a large chunk of our people who still live in abject poverty, Jain said.
 
 He pointed out that the Indian economy is a pleasant contrast to the sluggish global economy. It is the world's fastest growing major economy with a GDP growth of 7% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.
 
 With the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bills cleared by the cabinet, and set to be passed by parliament, tax reform is now a reality. The GST regime will simplify India's complicated tax code and bring many more businesses under the tax net, thereby increasing revenues, Jain said.
 
 Highlighting the 18% growth in foreign direct investment in 2016, he said relaxation of investment rules in various sectors should contribute to a further increase in FDI inflow in 2017.
 
 Jain said while India continues to integrate with the global economy, the world has changed. “Globalisation and the rise of multinationals was perhaps the overarching story on the world business landscape for over two decades. But a string of recent developments has significantly altered the narrative,“ he said.
 
 He said the two-day ET Global Business Summit was an endeavour to bring together leaders from across the globe to share insights on how best to navigate an uncertain and dynamic future.
