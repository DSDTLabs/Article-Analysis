BHUBANESWAR:  , the newly wed woman whose husband   died after a wedding gift the couple received exploded, and who was herself critically injured, is unaware of the tragedy. Her father-in-law Rabindra Sahoo said news of the death of her husband would hurt her chances of a recovery and traumatize her further. 

 The explosion, which occurred in   in Balangir district on February 23, also killed Soumya's grandmother Jemamani. 
 
 Reema, who received burn injuries, is being treated at the   in Cuttack. Their marriage was just six days old when Soumya died.
 
 Rabindra, a lecturer in a local college, said he had spoken to his daughter-in-law on Tuesday. 
 
 "Reema called me from the hospital. I had to control my emotions despite having lost my son. It suddenly dawned on me that this young woman has lost her husband. I had to frame my sentences carefully so that she could get no inkling of the tragedy that has befallen us," said the elderly man, who was at his workplace when the explosion took place.
 
 "I have no idea who sent the parcel, who my enemy is. I have worked in Patnagarh for the last 25 years and I am friendly with all my colleagues. As for my son, I don't think he would hide anything from me," he added.
 
 Rabindra and his wife are currently staying with some relatives as the police have sealed their house. The freshly painted walls bear signs of the explosion. The kitchen bore the brunt of the blast, while walls of the other rooms have cracks on them.
 
 "After the explosion, Reema was the first to come out of the house. She was conscious and cried for help. She collapsed in the garden in front of the house after informing locals of what had transpired," Rabindra added.
