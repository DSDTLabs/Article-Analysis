NASHIK: The   (NMC) is planning to   against two financially troubled   - Shriram and Balaji - as the civic body is not getting back its deposits of Rs 11 crore. 

 Both the banks are under liquidation and the civic administration is seeking legal advice on the issue.
 
 A senior official from the NMC said, "We had deposited Rs 11 crore in these two cooperative banks a few years ago. These banks are in financial trouble and under liquidation. We are yet to get our deposits from them. We have deposits of Rs 10.50 crore in Shriram cooperative bank and Rs 48 lakh in Balaji coopearative bank."
 
 "Of the Rs 48 lakh, we have received Rs 10 lakh from the Balaji bank. We are continuously pursuing our case with the banks for our deposits. Banks say they are recovering their loans and will make the payment soon. We recently sent a letter to the commissioner of co-operatives, urging him to instruct the banks for paying our deposits," said the official, adding now they are planning to move court against these two banks.
 
 The NMC already has fixed deposits in nationalised, private and co-op banks. "The financial condition of the civic body is good at the present. The Local Body Tax (LBT) has been cancelled, but it is applicable for those trade or industry having annual turnover above Rs 50 crore. There are around 90 firms having annual turnover above Rs 50 crore and they are paying LBT. The NMC is getting grants of LBT from the state government every month," he said
 
 "The Goods and   (GST) is likely to come into effect from July 1. We hope we will get the LBT grant every month even after introduction of the GST from July 1," he added.
