NEW DELHI: The   has registered a case against unknown officials of  , German company   and global computer major   in connection with alleged irregularities in the procurement of Rs 225 crore worth of software by the national carrier in 2011. 

 The agency registered the case on the recommendation of the   (CVC), which had found prima facie procedural irregularities in the procurement of the software, sources said.
 
 After considering the reports of the chief vigilance officer of AI, the commission in its communication to the CBI said it is of the view that “there are serious procedural and other irregularities in the procurement as well as amount paid and extent of services rendered”.
 
 The CVC asked the CBI to probe the “irregularities in the tendering process and award of contract”, “undue benefit caused to SAP/IBM”. It had also asked the agency to probe whether any of the persons who dealt with the issue in IBM and the government got any financial and other benefits and irregularities relating to the registration by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposal. TOI sought a response from IBM but did not receive any reply.
 
 The CVC has also alleged that there was no approval from the ministry of civil aviation even though Air India had claimed that it had made a presentation before a group of secretaries on July 9, 2009 and in 2010 before a group of ministers.
 
 The vigilance agency said Air India had selected the software without justifying the need for the same since there was ERP, a business process management software of  , already in operation.
