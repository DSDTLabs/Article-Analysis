Tuticorin: Close to a dozen people, mostly children, have died of drowning in Tuticorin district in a weekâ€™s time. Most of these deaths took place on tanks, ponds, water collected in abandoned stone quarries and in open wells in and around Kovilpatti. Officials recalled that in one of the occasions three boys had drowned and died in a tank the same day.

 District collector N Venkatesh has issued an advisory to parents, asking them not to allow children to go for a swim without the supervision of   or elders. He noted that there are over 1,000 ponds, tanks, lakes, open wells, stone quarries and other natural sources of water.
 
 He said that most of these man-made and natural waterbodies are in rural areas. The collector added that silt and swarm in some of the water bodies are turning out to be death traps for children who are at home for summer holidays after their final examinations. Rise in mercury levels are drawing children to these waterbodies to beat the heat.
 
 Unaware of the depth and danger that is in store for them in these waterbodies they step in, which claim their lives. Asking parents not to allow their children to go alone for a swim, Venkatesh also advised parents not to allow children under the sun during the day to avoid direct impact of the sun which will reduce the need for playing in water.
 
 Parents should also keep their children occupied with other activities, he added.
