NASHIK: The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( ) has started a new   service from   railway station to Shirdi to cater to devotees visiting the Saibaba temple.

 The devotees reach the Nashik road station by trains from various parts of the country. “We have started bus service for devotees that come from various parts of the country — especially the northern part of the country — from the Nashik Road bus stand. The bus starts its trip to Shirdi at 5.15am,” said R D Jagtap, divisional transport officer ( ), Nashik.
 
 The bus originates from Sinnar depot and heads to Shirdi via Nashik Road railway station.
 
 With this, the MSRTC plans to tap the potential of travellers from Nashik Road to Shirdi — who otherwise opt for the private mode of transport.
 
 “Whenever we have to travel to Shirdi, we come at the Nashik Road ST stand. But the buses to Shirdi are mostly full. As a result, we have to depend on private transport. Any additional bus from here will be a welcome move,” said  , a Nashik Road resident.
 
 “Depending upon the number of passengers opting for the bus, the MSRTC plans to introduce more such services for Saibaba devotees from Nashik Road,” Jagtap said. 
 
 A large number of passengers travel from Nashik Road to Shirdi. Visitors from the northern part of the country, however, prefer getting down at Manmad than at Nashik Road.
