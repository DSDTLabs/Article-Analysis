THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : The government decision to start evening OPs in community health centres and taluk/district hospitals hasn’t gone down well with doctors working in government service. KGMOA, the union of doctors in health service, announced an indefinite strike starting on Friday. Doctors will boycott OPs and only attend emergency cases in casualty. Doctors in medical colleges won’t be participating in the protest.

 The provocation was an incident that happened at   centre in Palakkad on Thursday. A group, allegedly CPM workers,   that they wouldn’t be allowed to go out at 2pm, which is the existing practice. They wanted doctors to stay back and conduct an OP in the evening.
 
 KGMOA condemned the move as it felt there was not enough infrastructure or manpower to extend OP functioning during evenings. The evening OP is a sensitive issue as many doctors have private practice at that time.   its members to admit only   in hospitals from Saturday. If there is no resolution by April 18, the treatment of inpatients too will be stopped, said sources.
