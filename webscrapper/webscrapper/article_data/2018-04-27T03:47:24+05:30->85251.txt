The complainants had booked a flat on May 16, 2013, with possession promised within 42 months. The Mittals completed all payment in cheques, but 10 months after deadline, the builder is yet to complete the project. On August 16, 2017, they said that handover has been moved back by a year. To the Mittals’ request for refund, they were told earnest money and other charges will be deducted. H-Rera had asked the builder for a response by April 4. But when the builder neither filed a response, nor appeared before H-Rera, the latter sent the showcause, asking why they shouldn’t be penalised Rs 1 lakh per day.
