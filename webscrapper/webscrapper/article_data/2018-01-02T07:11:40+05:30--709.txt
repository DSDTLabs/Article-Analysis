BENGALURU: Outpatient services are likely to be affected in most private hospitals on Tuesday, in response to the Indian Medical Association’s call to suspend routine health services in protest against a bill that seeks to replace the Medical Council of India with a new body.

 Outpatients departments will be shut in most hospitals from 6am to 6pm. It may be recalled that private doctors had gone on a strike in November 2017 opposing the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment Amendment Bill.
 
 “It is disappointing to note that the Medical Council of India which was set up in 1956 is being proposed to be replaced by the National Medical Commission (NMC) as per the recommendations of Niti Aayog. This will only derail the modern medical system in India and push it to an irreparable stage,” said members of the Bengaluru branch of  .
 
 The IMA’s call has been supported by the medical fraternity. “We morally stand with IMA and express our solidarity. The Private Hospital and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) is supporting the call. Practising or not practising on Tuesday, though, is left to individual doctors,” said Dr C Jayanna, president elect, PHANA.
 
 However, emergency services, in-patient wards, and chemotherapy and dialysis units will function as usual. So will pathology labs.
 
 “We urge the Centre to withdraw the National Medical Commission Bill 2017 with immediate effect and subject it to thorough scrutiny considering all the realities of medical sciences. Else, people will end up suffering at the hands of poorly qualified doctors and alternative therapists who will work under the garb of modern practitioners,” said Dr Srinivasa S, president, IMA Bengaluru branch.
 
 The move has been supported by the medical students’ association as well, as they are opposing the exit exam proposed by the NMC bill.
 
 Candle light marches were held on several medical college campuses on Monday.
