LUCKNOW: A day after   authorities tried to give a clean makeover to the city following chief secretary's order to ensure 100% garbage collection from houses and waste disposal from roads, TOI's reality check exposed the cosmetic drive. 

 The chief secretary recently instructed LMC authorities to clean all zones by forming teams. The municipal commissioner formed teams comprising officials and engineers in all eight zones to clean roads and public places on May 17 and 18.
 
 On the first day, LMC team cleaned 42 major spots, including Darulshafa, Lal Kuan ward,   Bus Stand, Shivaji Marg, Aishbagh waterworks, Tilaknagar ward, Bhootnath market,   and the next day, it cleaned 40 areas like River Bank Colony, Planetarium, Aurobindo Park and Patrakarpuram Crossing.
 
 But majority of these spots were again found littered with garbage, polythene bags and dirty roads. The worst garbage accumulation was found at City Bus Stand, near   and outside Lalbagh Girls Inter College. Till late afternoon, roads turned garbage dumps again.
 
 Even tourist places like   were not devoid of mess. TOI found filth heaps at the rear of the monument. Even drains were choked with polythene and solid waste in areas like Ashiana, Bangla Bazar, and Kaiserbagh Bus Stand.
 
 A shopkeeper near Kaiserbagh Bus Stand said, "Though this is a bus stop for many routes, LMC rarely cares to clean. You will find garbage piles on roadsides round the clock and this raises a stink."
 
 Another garbage heap was seen alongside Chakbast Road, which was hindering traffic. Locals said LMC rarely cleans the spot. 
 
 Rajendra Singh, a resident, said, "Cleaning drive on a single day without follow-up has no meaning. LMC should ensure regular inspection of cleaned areas and penalise those littering streets. Only strict supervision by sanitary inspectors can ensure cleanliness."
