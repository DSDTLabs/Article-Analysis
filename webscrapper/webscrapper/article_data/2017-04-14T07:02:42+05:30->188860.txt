HYDERABAD: Vice President   on Thursday highlighted the tolerance under the reign of Mohammed   and hoped the tradition would continue in Hyderabad in the 21st century. 

 Delivering the first Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah Lecture at the Maulana Azad National Urdu University, the VP said, "One can only hope that its (Hyderabad's) inherited tradition of tolerance, co-existence, inclusiveness and cultural effervescence would continue to signal its uniqueness and remain an example for the country." 
 
 He said that Quli Qutb Shah's reign saw trust and friendship between Hindus and Muslims. Touching upon the treatment of communities by the government and quoting historians, he said it was that of 'equality of opportunity for   for practically all officers of the state'. 
 
 While the sultan differed with non-Shiite sects of Islam, Ansari noted that he was culturally 'at one' with Hindus and Parsis. "As a result, the whole outlook of the state as centred in the person of the sultan was non-communal." 
 
 The Sultan treated Telugu 'like a mother tongue' and used Telugu in his Dakhni poems, and the firmans were bilingual. "Thus, the Sultan made a deliberate attempt to synthesise cultures in the Deccan imbibing in the people of Hyderabad a relish of tolerance, love of spectacle and mildness of nature," he said.
