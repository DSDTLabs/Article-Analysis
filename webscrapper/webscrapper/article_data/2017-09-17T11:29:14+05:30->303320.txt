Those who have worked with   would attest that the actor ensures that he does whatever it takes to enhance the technical aspects of the film. For his latest release  , the superstar apparently pushed for a cutting-edge   for the aerial shots in Scotland.
 
 In fact, it wasn’t even the cinematographer of the film who controlled the   but its still photographer,  . He tells us, “I had done two to three shots in the song sequence for the film in Kerala. Prithvi and the film’s director Jinu Abraham were impressed with my work and that’s when they decided it was better if I handle the drone in the Scotland schedule too rather than hire someone from there.”
  
 The movie warranted a lot of aerial shots to show the locales of Scotland as well as for the chase sequences. “I shot for 30 days with my equipment after which it started showing errors. That’s when Prithvi told the producer that I am doing my job well and asked him to get me the latest drone that cost about Rs 4 lakh. Prithviraj assured them that it would still cost less than hiring a drone operator,” says Mahadevan, adding that he shot with the equipment for the rest of the film.
  
 On the advantages of using a drone in movies, Mahadevan, who first filmed scenes using the equipment for Kamal Haasan’s Vishwaroopam, says, “It doesn’t have the constraints of a jib setup that needs at least five technicians to assist.”
  
 The photographer, who also got a credit as the helicam operator for the film, however says that he has no plans to be a cinematographer in the future. “The dream has always been to direct a movie,” says Mahadevan, who has also handled the helicam for Prithviraj’s Vimaanam.
