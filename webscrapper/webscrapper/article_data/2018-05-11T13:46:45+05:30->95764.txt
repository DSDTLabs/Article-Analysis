THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Two transgender people from Kerala tied the knot on Thursday, becoming the state’s first such legally-registered couple. Ishaan  , 33, and  , 31, both residents of Thiruvananthapuram, have known each other for nearly six years, during which both were involved in various welfare activities for transgender community members.

 
 
  
  
 
 
 When cupid struck the two around six months ago, it was the community members who planned the wedding after the consent of the couple’s parents, who also belong to the transgender community.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Ishaan and Surya underwent sex reassignment surgery in 2015 and 2014. The couple had earlier said that   and Surya would fill the column in the marriage registration forms as male and female, respectively as they had undergone sex reassignment surgery and have ID cards mentioning their new gender. 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 Thirty-one-year old Surya is a known TV-stage artist. The wedding was held at MMNC Hall. The groom and bride were welcomed by a dance performance by the community members.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Surya’s foster mother and makeup artist   said, “I take care of Surya. It is not a financial support. We are bonded through love. Surya, too, is foster mother to someone else in the community. Like me, Sreekutty is the foster mother of the groom. We provide all support for our people who are ready to do work and lead a financially-independent life,” she said.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Social activist  , who also attended the wedding, said the function did not have a lot of rituals like conventional weddings.
