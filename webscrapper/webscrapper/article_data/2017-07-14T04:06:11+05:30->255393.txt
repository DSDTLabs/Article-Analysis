NEW DELHI: The government has approved a full-fledged intelligence wing in   (SSB), which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders. 

 The move, officials said, would give a boost to operational efficiency of SSB as there would be 650 dedicated posts for intelligence gathering at these borders. SSB guards these two borders where there are no restrictions on the movement of people on either side.
 
 Officials said that there was a need for SSB's own intelligence wing as the whole border area comprised of densely populated foot hills and plains, thick jungles, under-developed regions and inhospitable terrains and the border population on both sides has strong regional, cultural and economic ties.
 
 "There is transborder movement of criminals and anti-national elements which pose a major challenge on the border in the context of the visa-free regime. Most of the stretches of the border are infested with ISI acitivists, Indian insurgent groups (IIGs), left-wing extremism (LWE), fundamentalists, smugglers of arms/ammunition, narcotics, Indian fake currency and human traffickers. In addition to that, various other anti-India forces with the help of inimical groups are also trying to foment trouble on Indian side," said SSB PRO, Manoj Keshav.
 
 There was a need for   and intelligence wing will help in it.
 
 "It was felt that a well knit intelligence network of the highest capabilities that can function and deliver would be the prime requirement of comprehensive border management. This was quite essential as the operations of SSB have to be intelligence based so as to prevent criminals and smugglers from taking advantage of the friendly borders with Nepal and Bhutan," he said.
 
 SSB had sent a proposal to MHA for setting up an intel wing to strengthen the efficiency and operational mandate of the force on borders and for internal security duties in J&K and anti-Naxal duties in LWE areas.
