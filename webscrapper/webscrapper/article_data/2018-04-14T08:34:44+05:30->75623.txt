 It began with the investigation into the death of Sriramappa, 35, a labourer and resident of Chikkagattinagabbe village, Hosakote taluk, following a complaint filed by wife  .
 
 Tirumalashettihalli police, Hosakote taluk, who are investigating the case, said Sriramappa was found unconscious with severe head injuries in Haraluru village early on April 10. He was rushed to a private hospital in Hosakote and later shifted to Nimhans hospital where he succumbed to his injuries around 11.30pm on April 11.
 
 On Thursday (April 12), Narayanamma filed a complaint, accusing   leader  , aka Nani, of Doddagattinagabbe village, his nephew Ranjith and their associates of the murder of her husband.
 
 Bheemashankar S Guled, superintendent of police, Bengaluru Rural district, said, “Preliminary investigations have revealed that Sriramappa and his associates robbed Ranjith, the main accused of Rs 30 lakh on April 7. In a bid to recover the money, Ranjith and his associates murdered Sriramappa.”
 
 Police have registered a case of kidnap, murder and criminal intimidation against Ranjith and Nani and have also invoked provisions of the SC/ST Act since Sriramappa is a Dalit. However, they say Nani may not be involved and that Narayanamma may have dragged his name into the case with a political motive.
 
 Police say Ranjith had given Sriramappa Rs 30 lakh in return for “a huge amount” of fake currency. However, Sriramappa took the money and ran away. Ranjith and his associates tracked down Sriramappa, and in a bid to question him to find out his accomplices, ended up fatally injuring him. Further investigations are on to track Sriramappa’s associates.
