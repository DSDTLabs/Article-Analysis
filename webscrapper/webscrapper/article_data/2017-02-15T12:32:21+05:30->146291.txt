PATNA: The   (SC/ST) of judge   on Tuesday ordered Patna police to take no coercive action against PMCH principal  , who is facing arrest for allegedly assaulting and abusing dalit medico Dr Alok Kumar on November 16 last year.

 IG-CID (weaker section)  , on February 10, ordered Dr Sinha’s arrest after finding the medico’s accusation against him true. The principal allegedly had not allowed Dr Alok to enter the premises without apron and identity card. The IG, while issuing arrest order, had also rapped up Patna police for not doing justice to a dalit. 
 
 The special court, while hearing Dr Sinha’s petition for anticipatory bail in the case, has also asked the police to submit the case diary before February 17, the date of next hearing. 
 
 Special public prosecutor   said the video clip of the scuffle between the two would also be submitted in the court to verify whether the principal had used any caste-related derogatory words against the medico to be booked under the SC/ST Act. Dr Alok alleged that the principal had abused him in the name of his caste.
 
 Dr Sinha’s counsel J Rai said, “The principal did not use any derogatory word pointing out the caste of Dr Alok. A minor scuffle took place between the two in which the principal is not liable to be booked under SC/ST Act.” Rai also referred to the video of the incident.
