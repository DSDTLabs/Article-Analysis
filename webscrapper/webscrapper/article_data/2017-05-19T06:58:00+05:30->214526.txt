 The farmers are currently selling their produce at the rate of Rs 1,635 per quintal, which is the government rate. For private buyers, they are selling wheat at the rate of Rs 1,750 per quintal.
 
 “This is the first time in the past three years that the farmers have managed to immediately sell their harvest. Most of them had a cash crunch that had built up due to crop failures. The wholesale crop trade is presently being carried out in cash,” Dushyant Nagar, convenor, Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, said. 
 
 The government rate of procurement of wheat has increased from Rs 1,450 in 2016 to Rs 1,635 in 2017, resulting in an increase in the farmers’ profit margin. According to KSS, private buyers, to remain competitive, have increased procurement rates to Rs 1,750 per quintal which is Rs 100 more than the prevailing government rate.
 
 “Last year, the farmers faced immense difficulty in selling their wheat harvest. Some were even forced to sell their wheat at the rate of Rs 1,000 per quintal. Now, the strict regulation of buying-selling norm has begun to show a positive impact. Liquidity is very important for farmers so that they continue to invest in their agriculture and grow healthy crop,” Nagar said.
 
 Farmers’ issues were one of the first areas in which chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath took immediate action, post his appointment. A relief, loan waiver of Rs 36,359, was announced in April too.
