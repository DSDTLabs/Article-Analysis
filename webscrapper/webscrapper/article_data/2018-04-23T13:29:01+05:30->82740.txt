HYDERABAD:   deputy leader T   on Sunday demanded that TRS government should extend 4,000 per acre sop to tenant farmers too. 

 Stating that the government has decided to provide sop only to farmers who own agricultural land and not to poor ryots who are tilling it, Reddy said, "How many owners of agriculture land will share or give the entire sop to tenant farmers. The government should think practically and reconsider its decision."
 
 He further said the government should give clarity on whether it will give 4,000 per acre sop for two crops to farmers growing turmeric, chilli,  . Reddy said these crops are grown once a year, unlike paddy which is grown twice a year. "While paddy farmers will get 8,000 per acre under the scheme in a year at the rate of 4,000 per acre per crop, their counterparts growing   and   will get only 4,000 per acre. The input that goes into raising chilli, turmeric and cotton is also very high and these are labour-intensive crops," he said.
