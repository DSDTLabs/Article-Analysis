TRICHY: Drinking water starved residents of Thiruppainjeeli in   blocked state minorities welfare minister S Valarmathi’s convoy at   demanding assurance to end the water shortage. The minister along with Manachanallur   M Parameswari was on her way to attend the birth anniversary celebrations of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa in Thiruppainjeeli on Tuesday.

 Thasildar Mahalakshmi along with a police team led by inspector Alaudeen from Manachanallur police station rushed to the spot and carried talks with the agitating residents. Residents called off their protest after they were assured a solution for the water issues.
