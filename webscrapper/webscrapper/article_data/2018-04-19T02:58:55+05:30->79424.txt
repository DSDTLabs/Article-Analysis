MUMBAI: A politician has alleged that the court restriction on   up to 150 metres from city railway stations continues to be flouted. 

  city unit secretary Vivekanand Gupta in a tweet said two illegal shops were seen within 150 metres of Churchgate but the   encroachment department did nothing. 
 
 "This same scene is seen at other railway stations in the city as well like   where hawkers are seen all throughout the day," he said. BMC officials said that some stalls outside stations had been given licences long ago and could not be moved out.
