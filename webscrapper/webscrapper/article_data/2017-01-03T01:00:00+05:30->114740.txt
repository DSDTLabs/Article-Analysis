 has been in the news as much for his relationships as his work. The actor, who made headlines for his acrimonious break-up with ' ' co-contestant  , has decided to solely focus on work for the time being. And, it’s not because he has become cynical about matters of the heart. “I will wait for the right person, and don’t want to get married at least for another three years. Bachelorhood is as nice as being in love. However, my definition of love hasn’t changed — it has to be unconditional,” he says.
For now, Kushal is enjoying the positive feedback for his show, ' '. “I would rather be an A-lister on TV than take up erotic films. I don’t want to do films just for the heck of entering Bollywood,” he states.
 While he is happily single in real life, the actor is enjoying being wooed by two women —   and   — on the screen. “It’s fantastic, even if it’s just for those 12 hours of shoot,” he says, adding, “We complement each other. Nobody is dating anybody (laughs!).”
 Recently, much was written about his proximity to  . So, what’s with him being the knight in shining armour for heart-broken ladies? Kushal says, “I am not in touch with Ankita; I have been too busy with my work. But I guess they (exes Ankita and Sushant Singh Rajput) are in happy zones. As far as Jennifer (she divorced  , who then married Bipasha Basu) is concerned, she has moved on in life. She is always smiling.” 
 His only regret, he says, was being a part of 'Bigg Boss 7', where he met and fell in love with Gauahar. “I realised that I was childish and straightforward, I always stood for the right. That house is for calculative people. The show puts you too much out in the open — people start judging you and I don’t like it.”
 Though he had an unpleasant break-up with Gauahar, the two now seem to have mended bridges. “I agree that our relationship ended abruptly, but I am cordial with her just like I am with all my exes,” he signs off.
