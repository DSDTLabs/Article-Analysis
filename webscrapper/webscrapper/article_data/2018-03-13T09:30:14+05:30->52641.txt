MOHALI:   have outrightly rejected the proposal to increase the booking charges of the community centres. The agenda came up for discussion at the   house meet on Monday, where it was proposed to increase the booking charges for community centres by nearly 25%.

 The house opposed the proposal and said the community centres are primarily meant to facilitate the poor and lower middle class residents, who cannot afford to hold marriage and other functions at expensive wedding halls.
 
 Increasing the cost of community centres will not be justified and those people will suffer, the councillors said. So, it was unanimously decided to reject the 25% hike proposal to book community centres.
 
 At present, the booking charges of a community centre in Sectors 55, 59, 61, 69 and 71 is Rs 17,930, including refundable security of Rs 5,000, while charges for the same in Sectors 54, 56, 65 and 70 is Rs 13,850, including the refundable security of Rs 5,000. The expenditure for the maintenance has to be borne by the MC.
 
 Mayor   said, “The hike is justifiable if proper facilities are provided at the community centres. The councillors demanded that such centres are booked by either lower middle class residents or by the NGOs and if the booking rate is increased then such community may be deprived of availing the facility. Councillors demanded that community centres must be centrally airconditioned before increasing the booking charges.”
 
 Giving assurance to the councillors, MC commissioner  , said, “The proposal was deferred and we will take permission from the government to make the community centres centrally air-conditioned.”
