SURAT: In a novel experiment, Navsari administration will appoint six IIM students as fellows to work in the villages of the district for one month. Fresh IIM graduates would get an opportunity to learn about the countryside and its problems and the district administration expects to gain from their experience.

 Three students are graduates of IIM, Ahmedabad and three had passed out of IIM, Indore. They would be arriving in Navsari on April 5 to begin their work under   run by Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Center. 
 
 Srijan Pal Singh, who worked with former President Kalam, said, “Navsari district collector   agreed to our proposal. At least 60 students of IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Indore were interested in Advantage Bharat Fellowship. However, we selected Asram Jamil, Swapnil Vispute and   of IIM Ahmedabad and Soumya Loomba, Ajay Jeevan K and Nishant Sangal of IIM Indore under the project.” 
 
 Ravi Arora said, “The idea is to get most from these best brains of the country in the shortest possible time. This experiment will definitely benefit the district.” 
 
 The IIM graduates would live like villagers for 15 days and suggest ways to improve conditions in the countryside. They would, if need be, even use the fellowship grant that they would receive to help the villages. 
 
 “These graduates have experience of having worked with big corporates. So, this experiment will definitely help the villages where they will choose to live. They will give their suggestions on water harvesting, administrative re-engineering, restructuring of local administration, social entrepreneurship, farming and community living,” Sirjit Pal said.
 
 “We are eager to provide a platform to these youngsters. They would prove to be catalyst for change,” Arora added.
