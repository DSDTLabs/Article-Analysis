Panaji: While the use of nutmeg and mace (rind) is popularly seen in food, scientists at the ICAR-CCARI have found an innovative use for the pericarp to prepare a mouth-watering dry fruit and a mouth freshner. The freshly harvested crop comprises two components: the rind called javetri (pericarp) and the kernel called jaiphal (nutmeg). While the latter is used as a prominent spice, uses for the former are not as popular. “The pericarp is much more in biomass compared to the spice product; approximately 70% of the total fruit. Its properties can be used to develop economically saleable products,” said A R Desai, senior scientist at the ICAR-CCARI. After several trials and experiments, the scientist developed the pericarp taffy, which is candied pericarp, and a mouth freshner made of grated pericarp. The candied version can be incorporated into assorted dry fruits or used as one of the ingredients in a Christmas cake. The mouth freshner is salt-based and can be eaten after a meal to enhance digestion. Besides these, the nutmeg pericarp has also been used by them to prepare jam, squash and an aerated drink. “Other states have tried making jam out of pericarp and it is equally commercially viable,” Desai said. He added that while the spice portion of the fruit is economically important, the pericarp by-products will also bring in additional income to the farmer. The institute is thus willing to share this technology with those interested in taking it forward and developing a market for it. “If any entrepreneur or self-help group is ready to come forward to adopt this technology, we are ready to give it to them on certain terms and conditions,” said Desai. ICAR-CCARI director E B Chakurkar said, “Cottage industrialists or even farmers who are interested in capitalizing on this can approach us. We will train them in developing this product.”
