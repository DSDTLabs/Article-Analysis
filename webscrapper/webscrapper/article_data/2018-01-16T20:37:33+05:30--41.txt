NEW DELHI: Since the formation of special ‘flying squads’ and the launch of a new ‘alpha’ squad by Central Industrial Security Force ( ) in October, over 1,500 commuters have been detained or penalised for misbehaving, creating a nuisance or smoking on the   premises. Officials say crime has been reducing drastically with the two   patrolling coaches and unpaid areas of stations.

 Launched as an additional measure to step up security, the alpha team has been tasked to travel in trains and catch offenders breaking the law. This includes sitting on the floor, causing a nuisance while travelling or entering the women’s coach. CISF officials say 22 teams, each consisting of one sub-officer and three constables, are operating across the metro network. CISF says that they may form more teams to further reduce crime. “The revamped alpha team has been travelling inside metro coaches to maintain law and order. This is an additional measure to the security we are already providing at stations. Over 15,00 passengers have been fined by these teams for breaking metro laws. Earlier, there was no one to act against violators,” a CISF official said.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Since October 2017, 429 male passengers have been deboarded and fined for entering the women’s coach. Another 845 have been fined for sitting on the floor inside the coach and 100 passengers have been penalised for other offences.
 
 For better security on the outside, special flying squads were formed in December to patrol the unpaid areas and entrances of stations to curb instances of eve-teasing, molestation and misbehaviour. CISF says the move has improved security and ensured that women commuters feel safer.
 
 “The main task of this squad is to create a psychological deterrence for people who may be loitering near the entrance gates. Such people are immediately sent away,” said a senior CISF official.
