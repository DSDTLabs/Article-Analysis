Mysuru: The   carefully preserved at the Oriental Research of Institute (ORI) at the University 0f Mysore (UoM) were invaluable documents of history, which spoke of inherited culture and traditions, said UoM in-charge vice-chancellor C Basavaraju on Friday.

 In association with ORI, JSS International Sanskrit Research Institute had organised a lecture on the importance of manuscripts, and their preservation at the JSS College for Women.
 
 Basavaraju, who inaugurated the event, pointed out that ORI had been established, primarily with the objective of preserving manuscripts, before UoM itself was set up. Pointing to the vast collection of manuscripts housed at ORI, he said, “UoM officials wrote to the Centre five years ago about the importance of the institution, and ORI was subsequently recognised as a research centre, and initiatives taken to preserve the manuscripts.”
 
 “Manuscripts and many important scriptures at ORI were ruined by termites. With donations from the American ambassador, the institute was subsequently revived. You will not find the manuscripts, and the knowledge available at ORI,” Basavaraju said.
 
 Stresing the importance of digitisation of the manuscripts, he said, “Only through digitisation can this knowledge be passed down to the younger generations.” He added that Sanskrit researchers and scholars would have to take up translation activities to render Sanskrit and Persian scripts into other languages so that they could reach a greater section of the people.
 
 Registrar D Bharathi, academic Dean HB Suresh, director of ORI S Shivarajappa, former director of ORI TV Satyanarayana were present.
