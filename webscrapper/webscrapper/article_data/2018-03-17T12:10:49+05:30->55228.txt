MARGAO/PANAJI: A fresh   of a humpback dolphin washed ashore at   beach on Friday evening. This takes the toll of marine species found dead and injured on Goa’s coastline to 51 in seven months.

 In all, 12 such dolphins, three finless porpoises and 28 Olive Ridley turtles have been found dead while eight injured turtles were treated and released over the last seven months.
 
 The female dolphin was noticed by Drishti lifeguards and they informed the forest department about it. “No injury could be seen on the carcass, though it appears to have died only a couple of hours earlier,” a source said.
 
 Range forest officer (RFO)   said that veterinary doctors examined it on the spot and later conducted a postmortem. “The doctors stated that it died due to a head injury. The postmortem report will be received on Monday,” he said. A panchanama was also conducted and the animal has now been buried. The dolphin was 2.6m long and 1.2m wide.
 
 Concern is growing among wildlife enthusiasts and forest department officials as marine species are facing an intense threat from human activities on the shoreline and the government has not turned its attention to the mater yet.
