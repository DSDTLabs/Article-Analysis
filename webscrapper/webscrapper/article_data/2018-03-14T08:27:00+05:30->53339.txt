CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh district courts have been made sensitive to the needs of the disabled. Right from corridors to stairs to parking, facilities have been provided to ensure that specially-abled persons do not have to depend on anyone to get their work done. This is being done on   guidelines.

 Signboards in braille have been installed outside lifts and washrooms have been installed in both English and Braille. Work on floor tiles to assist the blind has recently been completed. There is a dedicated parking space as well. Besides, corridors have been laced with tactile navigation tiles to help specially-abled persons move around without help.
 
 To facilitate specially-abled persons, stairs have been designed for   people using tactile warning strips. This helps them find their way around with a stick. Steel railings have been installed in the entire   complex to help specially-abled persons walk without help. In the conference of chief justices held on April 5 and 6, it was resolved that high courts should prepare vision statements for the high court and district courts. They were to make five-year and annual plans for differently-abled persons while preparing a construction plan for court complexes and facilities to be provided.
