MOTIHARI: Dhaka MLA from RJD Faisal Rahman got another extortion call on Monday while he was at his residence in Patna.   According to Rahman, the extortionist had asked him to pay a ransom of Rs 20 lakh on September 12.    The MLA had then lodged a case with the Dhaka police station but police have so far failed to trace the caller as the call was made from a Nepali sim. East Champaran S P Upendra Kumar Sharma said this time again, the call was made from a Nepali number. Talking to TOI here on Tuesday, Rahman said as soon as he received the call on Monday he again lodged a case with the Airport police station and informed Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj.    “Patna SSP has asked me to give the details of FIR which I had lodged with the Dhaka police station on September 12,” said the MLA.    Furious over police failure to crack the case, Rahman said, “Law and order is fast deteriorating in East Chamaparan and at least seven persons including traders and politicians were threatened by the extortionists in September but police are yet to arrest the criminals.”
