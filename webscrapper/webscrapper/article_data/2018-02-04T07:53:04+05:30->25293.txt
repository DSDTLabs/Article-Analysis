It is called Ferangi Mahal and is iconic because it hosted Mahatma Gandhi on his Lucknow visits. But, the building, the name of which translates to ‘foreigner’s house’, was also known as ‘Franc’s quarters’ at some point in history during the Mughal rule.

 The name has genesis in the fact that it belonged to a French trader as its residence. At the turn of the 17th century, by order of Mughal emperor  , the home was handed over to the two sons of   (Maulana Abdul Bari Ferangi Mahali’s ancestor).
 
 
 A scroll from Aurangzeb’s court from April 9, 1694 (14th day of the Islamic month of Shabaan, 1105 Hijri), now digitised, hangs on the walls of Ferangi Mahal. Below the royal Mughal seal that enlists Aurangzeb’s family tree right up to   is the text in Persian.
 
 “It says ‘yak haveli faranki’ (one Frenchman/foreigner’s home) in Awadh’s Lucknow is to be handed over to Sheikh Mohammad and Mohammad Saeed, the sons of Mulla Qutubuddin. Mulla had taken a representation to Aurangzeb entailing the martyrdom of their father and the family losing a roof over their head,” says Adnan Abdul Wali Ferangi Mahali, whose mother’s ancestor was Saeed.
 
 Adnan says he heard from his maternal grandfather that the house was a French trader’s abode from whom it was seized on failure of paying taxes to the Mughal court.
 
 “But the royal farmaan clearly mentions that administrative officials of that time were not to take any taxes from our family,” he adds.
 
 The story is also mentioned in ‘Baniy-e-dars-e-Nizami’, a biography of their family member Mulla Nizamuddin by  .
 
 A similar incident finds mention in Meer Sher Ali Jafri’s book ‘Aaraish-e-Mehfil’, he says.
