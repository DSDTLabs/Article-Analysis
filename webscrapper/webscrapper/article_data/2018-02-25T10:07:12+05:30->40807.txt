HYDERABAD: A bomb scare in Bhubaneswar-bound   sent the government railway police in a tizzy at Khammam station in   on Saturday. Though the suspicious object was detected around 9am, it took several hours for the bomb disposal squad to reach Khammam from  . This triggered further tension as officials feared the bag could contain explosives. It is not clear whether  , the biggest railway junction in South India, does not have a bomb squad as authorities requisitioned services from Secunderabad. At 10.30pm, it was declared a hoax.

 
 Earlier, panic gripped passengers on board the coach S-11 of No 11020 Konark   after they spotted an unclaimed bag in the compartment near Madhira railway station, which is located between Warangal and Khammam stations and falls under Secunderabad division of SCR.
 
 
 
 
 The train departed Mumbai station on Friday. However, panic-stricken passengers alerted railway police immediately after they saw the bag. Sources said cops cordoned off the compartment as soon as the train chugged into Khammam station. Officials of Railway Protection Force (RPF) and government railway police (GRP) rushed to the spot with sniffer dogs and launched a search in the train. They did not find any explosive. They, however, found a plastic box inside the handbag. At 10.30pm, it was declared a hoax,, according to sources.
 
 
 Uma Shankar Kumar, chief public relations officer of SCR said, “We came to know about a suspicious object in the S-11 coach of Konark Express that was going to Bhubaneswar. Though many passengers panicked that a bomb may have been stashed inside, it turned out to be a paint box. After the a search, the train resumed its journey.”
