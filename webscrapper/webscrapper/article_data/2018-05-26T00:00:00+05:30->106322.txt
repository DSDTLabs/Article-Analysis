Actress Tanya Hope’s new film,  , will mark the launch of  , the son of Sandalwood star couple   and  , as an actor. Speaking about the film, which will be directed by Nagshekar, Tanya says, “Amar is a love story that narrates how love evolves between two head-strong individuals, played by Abi (as Amar) and me (not yet named) and the journey they take together, both literally and figuratively. My character is that of a spoilt, rich brat and his too is that of a spoilt person, so our characters’ initial interactions are of arguments and hate for each other, which gradually changes.”
Delving more into her role, Tanya says, “In the film, my character has two distinct shades. The way she transforms over the course of the movie really attracted me to the role. The role has immense potential to challenge myself to convince the audience of her transformation. The story is intense and right up my alley.”
 The actress will soon be seen onscreen opposite Darshan in Yajamana.
