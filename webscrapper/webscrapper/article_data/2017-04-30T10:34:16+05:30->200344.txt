NEW DELHI: More than 433 men and women   personnel from the northeast have been inducted by the   to probe cases including crime against women and burglaries.

 These policemen were trained for almost a year to develop fluency in Hindi. They even underwent commando training and classroom lectures at the Delhi Police training schools to handle cases of crimes against people from northeast.
 
 They have been trained in law, police science, criminology, computer application, cyber crime and human rights with emphasis on professionalism, discipline and good behaviour. They also received a year-long training for language interface. For effective community policing they have been sensitised about gender issues, crime against women, children and senior citizens. Special emphasis was on the safety and security of women.
 
 They have been specially trained to deal with burglary, hurt, accident, rape and murder cases. 
 
 The women constables too underwent commando training at the Jharoda Kala outdoor training facility where they were trained in handling latest weapons, vehicle driving, firing practice and hand to hand combat. The ‘all-round best trophy was awarded to woman constable Chiewelou Thele from Nagaland. “We are happy to know that these constables have been trained in counter terrorism techniques, cybercrime, unarmed combat,” said Kiren Rijiju at the passing out parade on Friday.
