The sturdy red brick walls of the   are witness to many historic   and stories -some fresh in memory, others long forgotten. One of the lesser known is about a   on the northwest side of the original campus. Apparently innocuous, the room with a wooden   at the end holds a grim past.

 Barely the size of a train compartment, it was, until the 1960s, a 'custody room' for undertrials. The practice began in the British era, when accused were handcuffed and brought to court for trial held in the court room above. “It was a mini jail inside the court,“ says senior advocate Raghavachari.
 
 When a case came up for hearing, the accused would be escorted up the stairs with a door at the end leading to the court room on the floor above. When the case number was called, the undertrial would come out of the wooden door that would open on to the stand or bar for the accused in the middle of the court room.
 
 The custody room was barely 10ftx4ft and divided in half to accommodate the accused on one side and police escorts on the other.
 
 Since the pre-Independence era, the room has seen many a face with a notorious past. M K  , a star of Tamil cinema in the 1930s, was brought to this room after he was accused of murdering a journalist. Those unaware of the room and the staircase have their own ideas about how the accused reached the court room.
 
 “Trial would then be held in the high court. It was believed there was an elevator that took the accused to the court room,“ recalls former judge K Chandru. After amendments were made to the CrPC in 1973 and the high court stopped conducting trials in criminal cases, the room lost its importance.
 
 Until a few months ago it was used by journalists. The authorities are expected to turn it into an office room.
