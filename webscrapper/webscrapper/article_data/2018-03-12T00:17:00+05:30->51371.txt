Bengaluru:   activists are hoping that a Supreme Court order issued last week could go a long way in preserving forest cover and wildlife in the state. 

 In its order dated March 7, 2018, the SC had directed all states to file a detailed status report in four weeks on action taken against people occupying the forest land even after their claims under the Forest Rights Act have been rejected. The court has also directed filing of data as on December 31, 2017 with the breakup of total claims from Scheduled Tribes and from Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs) and the number of claims rejected in each category. 
 
 One of the important arguments made by petitioners, NGO Wildlife First, Nature Conservation Foundation, Amravati and TRACT, Nagpur, is that the original bill had no provision corresponding to OTFDs.
 
 Praveen Bhargav, trustee, Wildlife First, said the order has come at a time when unending claims from ineligible people over large extent of forest land, including in national parks and sanctuaries, are being entertained. “Such claims are causing irreversible fragmentation and loss of habitat or forests across the country,” he added.
 
 The petitioners have said over 20 lakh of the 44 lakh claims have been rejected across the country. While more than 50 lakh hectares of forest land has been given away with regard to the claims, not one hectare of critical wildlife habitat as mandated under Forest Rights Act has been notified even after 10 years. 
 
 The SC will take up the matter on April 18.
