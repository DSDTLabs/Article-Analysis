AHMEDABAD: An Indian   jawan, working in artillery, has been accused by his pregnant wife of beating her severely and locking her inside their residence in Ranip over a trivial issue of storing water. Anita Chaudhary, 27, states in the FIR she registered on Sunday that she is into her sixth month of pregnancy, and found it difficult to do heavy household work. But when she pleaded of her inablity to carry and store water, her husband thrashed her severely. Anita works as a Lok Rakshak Dal jawan in Madhavpura police station.

 
 “I was married to Rajesh Shubesingh Chaudhary, 23, of village Bhir of Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan, two years ago. My husband has been working with the Indian Army artillery-247 battalion for five years and he has been posted to Guwahati at present,” reads the FIR.
 
 She stated further in the FIR, “On May 27, when I asked him to store water, as I was having severe stomach pain, being six months pregnant, he started abusing me. When I opposed, he started slapping and punching me. He also threatened to kill me, and later he locked me inside the house and went away somewhere.”
 
 The woman then called up her husband’s father, who opened the lock and released her. She was later given treatment at   for her injuries.
