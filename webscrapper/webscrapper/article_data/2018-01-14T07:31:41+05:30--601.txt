BATHINDA: With the   and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) not holding political rallies at  's Maghi Mela, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is all set to be the only political party to mark its presence at the event on Sunday. 

 Like previous years, the party has decided to go ahead with its conference, despite the   asking political parties to stay away from events associated with Sikhism. For Sunday's rally, SAD has pitched a big pandal (stage) over four acres next to Malout Road. It has also earmarked a big space for parking vehicles. 
 
 The party is expected to raise the "unfulfilled promise" of farm loan waiver and taking on the Congress government for not sticking to its promise. 
 
 The issue of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib is also expected to be raised, as party leaders met Punjab governor V P Singh Badnore on Friday. 
 
 "Akal Takht directed that no conference be held at Shaheedi Jor Mela and we agreed to it. We are going ahead with the conference in Maghi, as no direction has been given for that. We are hoping for a massive turnout, as people are fed up with the Congress in less than 10 months of its rule. People feel the Congress has cheated them, especially as there has been no complete farm loan waiver and every household in the state does not have a job," said SAD's Muktsar MLA, Kanwarjit Singh Barkandi, who is overseeing arrangements for the conference.
 
 Barkandi hinted at the SAD also taking on the Congress over the   recently ordering that a special investigation team (SIT) be set up to relook into 186 cases of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi. "Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, and   president and Union minister   will address the conference," he said.
