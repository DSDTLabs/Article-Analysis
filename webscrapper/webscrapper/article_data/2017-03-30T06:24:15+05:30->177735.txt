AHMEDABAD: The   has now reached schools to make students aware about direct and indirect taxes. Interestingly, information about Goods and Service Tax (GST) was also given to the students of class 10 and 12.

 “Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) has begun a school outreach programme to raise awareness among students about indirect taxes. The object is to impart knowledge about the rationale of taxation and the role of taxes in nation building and to help make them responsible citizens of the future,” Raju Jetley, superintendent, Customs, told TOI.
 
 Earlier, one such school outreach session was held at   and the second was held at   on Wednesday, said Jetley, who conducts the session on taxation. Another session on taxation will be held at Zydus School on March 31.
 
 “The session is designed to sensitize students of classes X and XII about the tax structure of the country. They are going to be taxpayers and they will help in nation-building as responsible citizens,” added Jetley. 
 
 The sessions are interactive and students are encouraged to ask questions, develop ideas and share them, he said.
 
 Jetley said information was also given on GST, which will come into effect on July 1.
 
 “We want to continue these sessions at other schools too, but large numbers of students won’t be able to benefit from the session due to the ongoing exam,” he said. If the sessions at schools go well, the CBEC can take them to colleges too. Last year, the directorate general of taxpayer services of the CBEC had issued a circular to conduct school outreach programmes.
