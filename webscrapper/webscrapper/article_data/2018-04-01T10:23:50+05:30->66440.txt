KOLKATA: It will be a clash of similar styles when defending champions Bengal face Kerala in the summit clash of 72nd   at the   on Sunday.

 
 Both teams like to keep possession, use the wings to spread the game and build their attacks. With Tirthankar Sarkar controlling the game and spraying passes all-round, Sumit Das and Bidyasagar Singh have used the flanks to stretch the rival defences. The duo has not only scored six of Bengal’s 11 goals but also provided assists — like Sumit did in the semifinal against Karnataka, helping Jiten Murmu to break the deadlock.
 
 “I expect the ball to be more on the ground on Sunday and less pushing and shoving,” said Bengal coach Ranjan Chowdhury whose team lost to Kerala in the final group-league game. “Kerala’s midfielders have maintained a steady supply to their strikers up front. We lost to them earlier. It should motivate our players in the final,” Chowdhury added.
 
 On the other hand, Jithin MS — who like Bidyasagar has scored four goals — and Jithin Gopalan provide the width to Kerala’s game and are ably supported in attack by Rahul KP, Anurag PC and Sajith Poulose. Kerala have not only won all their matches so far but also scored 16 goals. Bengal defenders will have to be on their toes to counter the attacking threat of the five-time champions.
 
 The good news for Kerala is Anurag, who was stretchered off on Friday, has recovered from his injury and is expected to play. Poulose, who has slight ankle pain, too is expected to join the action. “I don’t think there are any favourites. The team that applies itself better will win,” said Satheevan Balan, coach of Kerala — who last won the title in 2004.
