JODHPUR: Two videos shot by hate crime accused killer   in one of the high security jails of the country—Jodhpur Central Jail—has once again confirmed the unabated and   by   in connivance with the jail staff.

 To make things worse, the jail administration has also failed to recover the mobile phone from the jail after intense search operations spanning the entire day after the videos went viral.
 
 The use of mobile phones in jails is not surprising as some hardcore criminals have been found in the recent past to be using mobile phones and also posting pictures and videos on the social media.
 
 While terming it a very serious matter, jail superintendent Vikram Singh admitted that it was a serious security lapse.
 
 “Such videos are being posted from jails very frequently. It puts a big question mark on security in the jail. We will take this matter very seriously,” he said.
 
 Though the jail administration did not find any mobile phones during today’s search, during similar searches conducted last year, the administration had recovered 35 cell phones. Of these, 21 cell phones were thrown into the jail premises from outside.
 
 In a major search operation by the then DIG (jail) Govind Gupta in February 2011, 50 mobile phones were recovered from the jail barracks.
 
 While mobile phone jammers have been installed in the jail to check its use, outdated technology used by these jammers in the era of 3G and 4G technology has made them redundant.
 
 Taking advantage of this technology gap, jail inmates have been regularly found to be using mobile phones.
 
 According to Singh, a proposal to install new jammers has already been sent to the government, but nothing has been done to replace the old 2G jammers.
