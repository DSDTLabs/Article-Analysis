Bhopal: Rattled by back-to-back ragging complaints, the authorities of National Law Institute University (NLIU) on Saturday suspended six second-year students and barred them from the hostel.

 The first complaint had surfaced on July 18, in which freshers alleged that they were forced to watch porn all night even sexually harassed. TOI was the first to report it on July 22. A few days later, another complaint was filed, saying that juniors were forced to stimulate sex with plants and trees on campus. In Saturday’s issue, TOI reported how NLIU is not handling the ragging row properly. Within hours, the management cracked down.
 
 NLIU officials confirmed that they have suspended the students, whose names figure on the ragging complaints. “They will not be allowed to stay in the hostel till the inquiry is over. They can face more punishment if the UGC anti-ragging helpline recommends it. We have given UGC a report,” said a senior official. 
 
 It comes at a time when the NGO Watch League raised questions about the security of freshers and informed the HRD ministry and other departments. Watch League convener Chandna Arora said, “It is good that NLIU finally woke up and took the action. However, there are several issues that need to be resolved. NLIU stirred only after the matter came in the media.” Hostels and common areas need to be under CCTV cover, she said.
 
 NLIU director Prof S S Singh refused to comment on the issue.
