PUNE: For daily-wage labourer Raj Rathore, buying a pair of jeans was far beyond his means. Rathore, who takes up painting work where he can find, simply could not afford to buy a pair. 

 However, the Hadapsar-based Shahid  , through their ‘Wall of Humanity’ initiative, made that dream a reality for Rathore and others like him, of few means.
 
 As a part of the initiative, donated clothes are hung on a wall in Hadapsar, and those in need are free to take what they need. The trust was started a month ago by Vijay More and his brother Anil. They accept donations in the form of old clothes, toys, furniture, cycles and other usable items, which are then kept on display for the less-privileged sections of the society. 
 
 It is open for all, and runs round the clock. Two trust workers man the stall in shifts, and sort the donations by size and type. 
 
 “People from middle-income and affluent backgrounds make the donations, which benefit daily-wagers, residents of slums and the homeless,” says Vijay. 
 
 “This is a very good initiative” says Rathore. “People in need, like me, often come here and take whatever they need,” he says, urging the trust workers to keep the donations and the surroundings clean. 
 
 Just like Rathore, hawkers and beggars are browsing through the pile of clothes.
 
 Veena Zadade, an accountant, passes the wall everyday on the way to work. “We have old clothes and other things we don’t use. So instead of discarding them, it’s better to give them to someone in need,” she adds. 
 
 “We came to know about this concept through social media and we are spreading the word through the same medium,” says Anil, Vijay’s brother. “There are people who are deprived of even basic needs, so it will be great to help them,” he said.
 
 Recently, the initiative was replicated in Karvenagar and Aundh.
