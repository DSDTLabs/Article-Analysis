BENGALURU: 
 This will be Flipkart's foray into one of the most transacted categories online as the e-tailer looks to build itself into a super app like China's WeChat. Super apps consolidate features such as chat, social media, mobile payments, games, and other services in one application. All of the group entities-- MakeMyTrip, Goibibo and RedBus will get access to the customer base of Flipkart to drive online travel booking in India. 

 For now, domestic flights will be the first offering that will go live on Flipkart over the next few days while other segments like hotels, bus and holidays will also be gradually introduced in the coming weeks, sources said.
 
 
 Adding new services like travel booking, food delivery, movie ticketing would help Flipkart in increasing user stickiness on its platform. 
 
 Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy had told TOI, earlier this year that the new core metrics that the company tracks include--number of transactions per user and monthly active user base. It is also gradually scaling up its grocery business which would get shoppers back on to Flipkart regularly. Amazon has been aggressively investing in its grocery vertical and that has resulted in frequent and repeat purchases by consumers. 
 
 The Bengaluru-based company has been looking to build a bouquet of additional services to increase transaction numbers. It had earlier held talks with online movie ticketing platform BookMyShow and food delivery startup Swiggy for an investment. But those ended due to terms that the online retailer was asking for, per sources close to the matter.
 
 
 Flipkart is believed to be putting a team together that would look after this business. 
 
 The SoftBank- backed Paytm, over the past 12-18 months, has been making similar attempts into online travel bookings, movie ticketing, and events by building these businesses on a standalone basis.
