COIMBATORE: The Campus Front of India plans to file a petition in the district court against Coimbatore city police commissioner A   as he has called it an anti-national outfit. 

 A day after pro-jallikattu protests turned violent, Amalraj told reporters on Tuesday that police had evidence to prove that members of Campus Front of India, Makkal Athigaram, Naam Tamilzhar and other anti-social outfits had infiltrated into pro- protesters and raised seditious slogans. He said after the police disbursed the crowd, members of these outfits indulged in violence.
 
 Campus Front of India state general secretary L Abdur Rahman said they had been part of the   since the day it began (on January 17). 
 
 “We have been fighting for the students’ rights and their education for several years. We also indulge in social service and serve the society constructively. We do not understand what the commissioner means by anti-national? Is fighting for Tamil tradition anti-national? Is helping students anti-national,” he asked. 
 
 Rahman said Campus Front of India members had been present at the VOC park for six days. “Only on the last day when police tried to forcibly remove the students, there was violence on our part. If we were anti-national, why did they not take action against us for six days,” he asked. 
 
 He said the outfit condemned the statement and would take legal action against the commissioner. “This is just an attempt to divert the attention of public from the police atrocities. There is video evidence of police setting autos on fire and beating up innocent women. This is proof that they were responsible for the violence,” he said.
 
 The outfit requested the state government to take action against Amalraj for indulging in violence and lathicharging innocent students.
