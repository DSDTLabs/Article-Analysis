HYDERABAD: Commuters travelling by   trains couldn't have asked for a better treat. They can now buy groceries/essential commodities at Metro stations. A first such grocery shop was opened at   station on Saturday. 

 The idea behind opening these shops is to help commuters, mainly those working at firms in Gachibowli, Madhapur,   and Manikonda, buy groceries even during odd hours, with ease. 
 
 The outlet was opened on the lower platform (near concourse area). The customers can get into the metro bogie with grocery bags into the metro rail without any hassle.
 
 Ameerpet is an inter-change station. Commuters coming from Miyapur and Hi-tec City have to get down at Ameerpet and catch another train to go to Begumpet, Secunderabad and up to Nagole. A majority number of software employees working in MNCs belong to these areas. "It is a laudable decision of LT&HMRL to allow grocery outlets for daily commuters. For techies, it is more than handy. We do not have to run around for groceries now," V Mahesh, a software employee working in an   at Madhapur told STOI. A resident of Uppal, Mahesh travels in metro now to his office. 
 
 Except for fruits and vegetables, all other essential commodities are available in the outlet.
