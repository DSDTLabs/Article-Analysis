Coimbatore: The city will soon witness the official launch of a forum that would stand against all sort of religious and   and voice for democratic rights of the people. Set up by a group of political outfits, Kovai People’s Platform is likely to be formally launched on this August 21.

 The brainchild of CPM, CPI, CPI(ML) Liberation, Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK), Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam (DVK), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and a few other Periyarist outfits, the forum has already taken shape. Now, they are planning to rope in Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson Gopalkrishna Gandhi to inaugurate the forum, besides scouting for the support of DMK, MDMK and a few other political organisations, which stand for secularism.“The common people are left to suffer as religious fundamentalists clash each other. And our objective is to maintain unity among the people,” said C Padmanaban, an organiser of the forum.
 
 Expressing a similar view, PUCL national council member S Balamurugan said, “No one has right to disturb secular and democratic nature of the society and Kovai People’s Platform will stand to protect it always.”
 
 Blaming Hindu outfits for often creating tension in the city, TPDK general secretary K Ramakrishnan said Kovai People’s Platform would stand against religious fundamentalist outfits if they were to disturb the people and peace in the district. .
 
 The members of the forum on Saturday petitioned the city police commissioner, A Amalraj, against allowing Hindu outfits to install Ganesh idols during the Vinayaka Chaturthi in a way that would disturb traffic and the people. “Flex banners should be allowed only three days before the festival,” they said.
