CHENNAI: The CBI case against M Natarajan, husband of the jailed general secretary of the  , V K Sasikala, in connection with import of a luxury car in the 90s, is picking up momentum in the Madras high court.

 Natarajan was convicted by an economic offences court and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for four years, and his appeals are pending in the high court for about seven years. 
 
 During the tenure of Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul (since elevated to the   as judge) as chief justice of the court, the CBI had given a memo seeking to expedite hearing of the case. 
 
 On Monday, Justice S Bhaskaran, before whom the appeals filed by Natarajan and others came up for further hearing, adjourned the hearing to February 27 for final arguments.
 
 The case relates to the import of a Toyota Lexus car in 1994 declaring it as a used vehicle of 1993 model. 
 
 The CBI and enforcement directorate registered separate cases against Natarajan and three others.
 
 According to CBI, Natarajan, along with three others — his nephew V Bhaskaran, Yogesh Balakrishnan and Sujaritha Sundararajan — substituted the original sale invoice with a photocopy of an invoice fabricated by changing the vehicle’s manufacturing date to July 1993. They cleared the car under transfer of residence provision, and thereby caused a of Rs 1.06 crore to the exchequer by way of short levy, penalty and redemption fine.
 
 While R Bhavani, assistant manager of Indian Bank’s Abiramapuram branch, turned approver in the case, another accused, S Balakrishnan, is still absconding. The ED, on its part, too, has given letters to the economic offences court to expedite pending cases against Sasikala, the newly appointed deputy general secretary of AIADMK T T V Dinakaran and others.
