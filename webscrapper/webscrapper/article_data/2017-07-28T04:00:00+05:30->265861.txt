Ahmedabad: The problem over water logging in residential societies took a serious turn in Modasa town of Aravalli district when police had to resort to lathicharge and lob tear gas shells when angry people blocked the road to vent their anger against the municipality.

 People of several societies gathered on the Dhansura-Modasa highway to protest against the municipality's snail-paced work in draining out rain water from their areas. The protests resulted in severe traffic jam and police requested them to go to the municipality and meet the chief officer to raise their issue.
 
 Sources said the residents living near Dungarwada cross roads are fed up as due to water accumulation in their societies since three days and complained that despite several representations, the municipality has not taken any action.
 
 "We also told them that they did not have any permission to sit on a protest on the main road. When we tried to evacuate them, there was stone pelting and one of our policeman suffered injury in the head," said KN Damor, superintendent of police, Aravalli.
 
 Police then resorted to lathicharge and lobbed six tear gas shells to disperse the mob. "We have lodged a complaint of rioting against a mob of around 1,500," Damor said.
