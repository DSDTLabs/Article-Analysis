PATNA: District magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi on Sunday constituted four teams to remove encroachments near the shops and garages on Bypass Road and directed the officials to take action under Section 133 of the Motor Vehicles Act against the trucks and tractors parked on the road.

 “The team comprises officials from Patna Municipal Corporation, SDO Patna City, traffic police personnel and other police officials. A ‘Halla Bol’ vehicle will also be part of the team to remove illegally parked trucks carrying building materials or cattle from the roads. SDO Patna City and SDO Sadar will conduct anti-encroachment drive continuously,” the DM said after inspecting the ongoing anti-encroachment drive on the Bypass and movement of vehicles on Gandhi Setu, J P Setu and Danapur-Digha road.
 
 With the ban on heavy vehicles on Mahatma Gandhi Setu, the problem of traffic jam on the bridge has been resolved to a large extent and the district administration is likely to allow trucks on the JP Setu from 10pm to 5am. “For this, we will have to raise the level of low hanging electrical wire and trim down some trees,” Ravi said.
 
 He also directed the officials concerned to install speed limit signage on Digha road. He also directed SDO Sadar to remove encroachments from the 90-feet Kankarbagh Mor and asked SDO Patna City to ensure the removal of encroachments from Pahadi Mor to Zero Mile.
