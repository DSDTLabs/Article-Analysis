NAVI MUMBAI:   cleared encroachment on a proposed service road connecting Ghansoli’s sectors 11 and 21 in   and Datta Nagar, Talvali and further to Airoli. This road could be an ideal alternate connectivity to decongest the busy Thane Belapur Road. 

 Two illegal plinth structures and a five–storey under-construction building have been demolished on Wednesday with adequate police protection. The Cidco anti-encroachment squad faced stiff resistance from locals who protested initially which delayed the action amidst police presence. Both the structures stood on 400 sq m Cidco acquired utility plots and despite eviction notice served on the developers more than once. 
 
 “As per our planning department, there is a proposed road being planned to cut through this encroached area which could serve as an alternative to Thane Belapur Road in the form of a service road in case of emergency, and we cleared all three structures,” said P B Rajput, controller of unauthorized constructions, Navi Mumbai (North), Cidco. 
 
 The five-storey illegal under- construction building was almost complete but was empty . It had come up on a 200 sq m Cidco plot. Notices were issued under MRTP Act to vacate the structure but the developer paid no heed and continued construction. “We served a final 24 hours eviction notice before bringing down the building. Due procedure of the law was followed to comply with high court order against such illegal structures,” said a Cidco official. 
 
 “After Digha,   node has highest number of encroachment for which development of this node has been jeopardized. Service road in this node is necessitated to connect Rabale and Airoli for seamless travel in the nodal side. Till Ghansoli village from   there is a service road in existence but beyond Ghansoli toward Airoli the link is missing which has to be developed on priority,” said  , an activist.
