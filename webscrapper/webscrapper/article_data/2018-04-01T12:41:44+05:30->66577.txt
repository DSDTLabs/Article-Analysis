TUTICORIN: Actor and   leader   visited Kumarettiapuram in   district to express solidarity with people who have been protesting against a   Industries plant for the last 49 days.

 “The injustice meted out to you is the cruel face of greediness,’’ he said hitting out at Sterlite.
 
 Kamal said he was there as an individual and not as politician eyeing votes. “More than an actor, I am a human being, a Tamilian,’’ he said. “I will speak against this unit wherever I could raise my voice,’’ he said.
 
 Earlier speaking to his fans, the actor said an industry that “cares nothing about the lives of people is not required for the country.” 
 
 Hitting out at the ruling AIADMK, he said the state government had ignored the voice of the protesting public. “The voice should reach the Centre now. Correcting a wrong is the job of the government. If the government failed to do that, people would do that,’’ he said.
