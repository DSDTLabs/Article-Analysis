ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad   on Thursday directed the   (EC) to decide a representation alleging that   (SP) has wrongly claimed in its election manifesto that it had completed  , Taj Expressway and Lucknow Metro projects during the tenure of its government.

 Disposing of the PIL filed by Prabhutikant, an advocate, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Dilip Babasaheb Bhosale and Justice Yashwant Varma directed the EC to decide the representation as expeditiously as possible. 
 
 The petitioner contended in the PIL that though the three projects are yet incomplete, the SP in its manifesto has wrongly claimed that they are complete. Further, on the basis of this false claim, the party is trying to woo the voters in the on-going Assembly election.
 
 According to the petitioner, such a misleading statement in manifesto of a political party is in clear violation of Section 123(2) of Representation of People Act and also amounts to misconduct on part of the party. Hence, the EC must take action against the SP.
 
 The petitioner had earlier filed a representation before the EC, but no action has been taken on it till date. Hence, he filed the PIL asking the court to take action against the party.
 
 Since the representation of the petitioner is pending before the EC, the court disposed of the PIL while directing the commission to decide the representation as expeditiously as possible.
 
 Section 123(2) of Representation of People Act defines undue influence and declares that its use shall be deemed to be an interference with the free exercise of the electoral right of elector within the meaning of this clause.
