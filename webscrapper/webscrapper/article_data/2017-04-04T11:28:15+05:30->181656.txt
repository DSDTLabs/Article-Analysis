BHUBANESHWAR: Odisha Chief Minister   has put to rest once the rumours of the entry of his sister into politics.
 
  “My sister is not interested in any political positioning, not in the Rajya Sabha nor anywhere else,” Patnaik told the media On Monday.
  
  Speculation that  , Patnaik's New York based elder sister would be given a Rajya Sabha ticket, began when Patnaik called back sitting MP Bishnu Charan Das.Coming as it did after a reversal in the fortunes of the seemingly invincible four time CM and with BJP’s rise to number two, in recent rural polls the move seemed extremely potent.
  
  Patnaik is neither predictable nor chatty and steers his own ship. What he will do next or not, as some of his colleagues have learnt the hard, is difficult to predict.
  
  Sister Gita Mehta’s arrival to Bhubaneshwar coincided with rumours of dissent, about Patnaik’s health issues, and essentially the BJD’s current vulnerability. A tweet by one of its own MP’s alleging sabotage, promptly followed by another’s open criticism which included a warning against roping in family, added fuel to the gossip.
  
  Party spokesperson, rubbished these stories as “media plants,” pointing out that the rural polls being sold as a win for BJP was still a win for them. And in fact, despite specific reversal, of the 314 block chairmen, who are the nodal agencies implementing government work, 218 were won by BJD’s candidates.
  
  Patnaik who has been meeting his newly elected representatives panchati raj institutions, for the first time at the party office, has begun the introspection he promised post the February polls. The efforts will address a complaint that the BJD’s own leaders have also made, that the CM of late was not receiving direct political feedback. On the cards next, could be a ministry reshuffle.
