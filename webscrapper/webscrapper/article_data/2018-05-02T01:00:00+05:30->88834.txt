 One of Omar Saeed Sheikh’s first acts of terrorism is said to be the kidnapping of four foreigners in Delhi but he was arrested by the Delhi Police and his plan was foiled. The crew shot this scene in the Pahadganj area of Old Delhi to maintain its realistic feel. It was a huge challenge for   and his crew to show the places where Omar received training and jihaad indoctrination from ISI handlers in POK (Pakistan Occupied Kashmir) and Afghani terror camps. After the team was denied permission to shoot near the Line of Control in Pakistan citing security reasons, the director picked a location close to the LOC in India to film the said portions.
 
 
  
 Omar was sentenced to death in Lahore in July 2002 for his role in the killing of international journalist  . The scene shows Rajkummar walking outside court, guarded by security forces. The crew was once again refused permission to shoot in Pakistan, so it also had to be recreated locally.
