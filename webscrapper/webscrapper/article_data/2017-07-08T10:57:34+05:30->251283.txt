HYDERABAD: The forensic analysis report submitted by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to the Banjara Hills police has confirmed that   Vijayalakshmi alias   was not raped.

 The Banjara Hills police received the final post-mortem report from   (OGH) and the forensic analysis report from FSL on Thursday night.
 
 While the final postmortem report confirmed that Sirisha died due to hanging, the viscera analysis report revealed the presence of ethyl alcohol in her stomach, confirming the statements given by the arrested accused, Rajiv and Sravan, that all of them consumed alcohol at Kuknurpally SI Prabhakar Reddy’s officials quarters on June 13.
 
 However, the analysis of the victim’s vaginal swabs and clothes at the FSL revealed that she was not raped.
 
 “The FSL report stated that there was no semen or spermatozoa found during the analysis of vaginal smears and the clothes of the victim. This means the victim was not raped,” West Zone DCP A   told TOI.
 
 Rajiv and Sravan have been arrested on charges of abetting Sirisha’s suicide. With the rape angle being ruled out now, the police are all set to file a chargesheet against Rajiv and Sravan.
