AHMEDABAD: Gujarat government's proposed bill to regulate fee in   promises to herald 'ache din' for parents ahead of 2017 polls. Private schools affiliated with state board,  ,   among others may be directed to cut fees by almost 50%. 

 "A fee regulatory authority will be formed once the bill is passed in the state assembly's budget session beginning February 20. Parents whose wards are charged exorbitant fees by schools can expect a relief of 50%," said a top education department official.
 
 Currently, private schools charge anything between Rs 30,000 and Rs 2.70 lakh per annum. Sources say the move will benefit parents of nearly 15 lakh students in Gujarat -- higher the fees, greater the relief. The state government's intervention follows complaints of rampant and arbitrary fee hikes by private schools.
 
 The official said that once the bill is passed, the process of standardizing a fee structure will be put into motion. Preliminary calculations by education department have revealed that the state government spends Rs 13,500 per student in primary schools while expenditure per child is Rs 27,000 in grant-in-aid secondary and higher secondary schools.
