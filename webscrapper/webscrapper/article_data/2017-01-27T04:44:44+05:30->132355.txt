NEW DELHI: Senior lawyer Abhishek   has withdrawn from the petition challenging the new   law legalizing  , a move seen as stemming from the pressure of the burgeoning emotions in the southern state.

 On Wednesday, Singhvi, who is Rajya Sabha MP from Congress, challenged the law passed by the state assembly this week after days of volatile face off with the Centre. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the plea of Animal Welfare Board of India on Monday.
 
 AWBI has accused the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government of frustrating the court’s order against animal cruelty, dubbing the new law framed by the state as illegal.
 
 However, within a day, Singhvi conveyed that he would not argue the case.
 
 When asked, he told TOI, “I have been a known supporter of rights and welfare of animals for several years and have appeared in court pro bono several times, including in the Kerala dogs case. But in deference to the Congress party sentiments in Tamil Nadu, I have decided to step away.”
 
 After fierce protests in Tamil Nadu arm-twisted the Centre into backing traditional bull fights that animal rights activists say perpetrate cruelty against animals, political parties fell in line and tailored their stance to suit the popular mood.
 
 The state assembly passed the new law legalising bullfights with a unanimous vote.
 
 Even the Congress state unit took out a march in support of jallikattu following consultations with the AICC.
 
 In this backdrop, the sight of a Congress neta pleading for reintroduction of the ban risked putting the party in the crosshairs of jallikattu backers.
