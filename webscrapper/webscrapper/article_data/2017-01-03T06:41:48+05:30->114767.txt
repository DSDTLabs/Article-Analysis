LUCKNOW: Has expelled leader of the BJP,   rejoined the party? It appeared so, the way Daya Shankar , who has earlier been the party’s vice- president was greeted and welcomed by senior leaders of the party at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Parivartan Rally in Lucknow on Monday. Daya Shankar had been expelled by the party for six years for his alleged unsavoury remarks against the BSP chief,  .

 Daya Shankar had so far been attending small rallies and the Parivartan Yatra of the BJP in different districts and also sharing dais with the BJP leaders. But the way he reached at Modi’s rally along with his supporters and was taken note of by most of the BJP leaders and state functionaries and the manner in which party MP Harish Dubey welcomed him, it was apparent he is back in the party.
 
 Daya had been sacked from the party for his sexist remark against Mayawati and though no formal and written orders were issued by the party leadership against him, he was dismissed. Soon after, BSP organised a protest and demonstration to shame Daya Shankar for his remarks and ended up saying nasty things about his mother and daughter. His wife   was quick to react and countered the remarks with a hugely supported demonstration. As Daya faced imprisonment, BJP stood by Swati and recently she was elevated as head of the BJP-Mahila Morcha. Speaking to the TOI, BJP spokesperson Hriday Narain Dixit said no written orders were issued against Daya Shankar Singh when he was dismissed.
