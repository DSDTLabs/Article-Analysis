MUMBAI: The Powai police on Friday arrested a 35-year-old man, Jeevan More, for killing his friend who refused to share a food parcel as the accused had not paid him Rs 10. The victim, Dinesh Joshi (30), died on Thursday a day after More, a labourer, assaulted him at a deserted locality in Powai. 

 "Joshi and More partied together on February 7 night and ended up fighting. More had not paid Joshi Rs 10 for the food and hence, the latter refused to share it," said deputy commissioner of police (zone X) Navinchandra Reddy.
 
 In the complaint, the victim's brother, Nilesh (32), said, "After returning home, Dinesh complained that More assaulted him. The next day, he complained of severe pain in stomach and collapsed. He was declared dead at the hospital." An officer said More was arrested based on a post-mortem report that showed severe internal injuries. He has been booked under the IPC section for murder.
