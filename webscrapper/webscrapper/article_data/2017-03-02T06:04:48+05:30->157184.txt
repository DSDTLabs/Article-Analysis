BHOPAL: Police on Wednesday did not seek custody of the   accused of sexually abusing a three-year-old girl. A court remanded him in jail for two weeks.

 The accused was arrested past midnight on Tuesday, two days after police registered a case under  . The cops haven’t even carried out a test identification parade although the family claims that the child indicated towards the preschool owner when they asked who had ‘hurt’ her.
 
 The wife of the accused insists he is innocent and said they will move a petition for a narco test on him to prove he is not the culprit. “I can’t understand what all is happening but if the need arises we will discuss with our lawyer and go for narco analysis test of my husband to clear the picture. If he has done anything wrong he will be punished but if he is innocent then no injustice should happen with him,” the wife said.
 
 The family of the child are critical of police action. One of her relatives told TOI that they approached police for the first time on February 24 but were turned away. It took them a long time to convince police to register a case. “The complaint and arrest were made only after the intervention of senior police official,” said a relative of the toddler.
 
 When TOI asked additional SP-crime Rashmi Mishra why police did not seek custody of the suspect, she said, “We don’t require police custody in this case as our investigation is going on and we can question the suspect whenever we can. There is more to this case and we are conducting a thorough investigation to find out more details.”
 
 A high-ranking official said, “We are going to conduct an identification parade. This case requires a detailed investigation. We also need to consider statements given by the toddler. It’s confirmed that she was sexually abused but there is much more in the case that needs to be investigated.”
