Vadodara: Panic spread in Ranoli area on the outskirts of the city when a natural gas pipeline of the GAIL (India) Limited got damaged on Monday morning leading to gas leakage. 

 GAIL officials came to know about the leakage in the pipeline at near gate number 10 of Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Limited (GACL) at around 11 am. 
 
 Officials of GAIL said that the pipeline got punctured because of horizontal direction drilling (HDD) work which was being carried out by a team deployed by the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPCL).
 
 “GSPL was carrying out HDD activity without any prior intimation to us. According to the norms, whenever such activity has to be carried out at inter pipeline crossing, intimation has to be given to all concerned,” said a GAIL official.
 
 “Quick response teams were deployed immediately and the situation was brought under control. The area has been cordoned off and two fire tenders stationed at the site,” said an official, adding that the damaged pipeline is being repaired.
 
 “During the period of repair, supply of natural gas to affected customers is lined up through alternate source to maintain uninterrupted supply of natural gas. Efforts are on to complete the repair work at the earliest,” a release issued by GAIL later in the day stated, adding that the leakage was quickly stopped and there were no casualties or damage to property due to the incident.
 
 GSPCL’s managing director J N Singh however told TOI that he will look into the matter. “In any case, we will provide all the required support to ensure that the operations are completely smoothly,” said Singh.
