Vijayawada: The most commonly used   by Vijayawadiites is fast turning into a death trap. Around six fatal and major accidents were reported to have taken place on the highway in March 2018.

 The accident count is high on the suburban areas of the national highway. The recent bus mishap (just two days ago) in Kanchikacherla area where a bus rammed a milk van caused ripple in the region. In the mishap the driver died on the spot. A number of major accidents have happened on the national highway. The major mishap in Mulapadu in March 2017 comes to mind immediately. Not to forget the horror of the Muddulacheruvu tragedy (September 2017) which claimed 16 lives.
 
 Many portions of the highway has seen a lot of upgrades in the last one decade, yet it is pertinent to note that the accident rate on the highway has seen a substantial increase after the bifurcation of the state. City police attribute this trend to rash driving and engineering defects.
 
 According to statistics provided by the cops, around 450 mishaps took place last year. Out of these, 200 were fatal. Officials pointed out that the highway has seen a lot of development in the last few years, from becoming a four-lane road to truck lay-by-lanes, emergency lanes and bridges across villages.
 
 “Back in 2006, it used to take me around seven hours to travel from Vijayawada to Hyderabad. Now I am able to make it in four hours but there is a risk. This kind of development has led to youngsters driving in a rash manner,” Ramakrishna, a sergeant working for highway police said.
 
 Despite a slew of measures initiated by the authorities to curb accidents on NH-65, as many as 200 persons died in road mishaps last year in a stretch of 130 km that passes through four towns — Suryapet, Kodad, Chityal and Choutuppal towns.
