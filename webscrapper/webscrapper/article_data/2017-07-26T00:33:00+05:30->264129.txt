Madurai: A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madurai bench of the Madras high court seeking to expedite construction of the government medical college and hospital at Sanappiratti village in Karur district. The court directed the case to be posted along with another case pending on the matter. 

 When the plea came up for hearing before the division bench headed by chief justice Indira Banerjee, counsel for the petitioner, former AIADMK councillor in Karur M N Prabhu, said that the health and family welfare secretary had failed to take any action to construct the medical college in Sanappiratti.
 
 It was former chief minister J Jayalalithaa who announced the medical college and hospital for Karur district in August 2014. The government later passed an order saying that the college would be set up with an intake of 150 students and admission would begin from 2016-17. Subsequently, three people donated 30 acres of land at Kuppichipalayam. The special officer appointed for the college wrote a letter to the Karur municipality saying that the land donated was unsuitable because it was 8 kms away from the district headquarters and had no road facility. 
 
 Following this, the Karur municipality passed a resolution on February 29 last year to give land for the medical college in the heart of the town. A case was filed before the high court bench against the said move saying that the municipality did not allot adequate land. The court disposed of the case on April 13 last year directing the government to take steps to provide adequate land to the college. 
 
 Subsequently, the persons who donated the land filed a case due to which the construction work in Sanappiratti village has been stalled. However, the petitioner said, there was no bar on the stateâ€™s health secretary to proceed with the construction. But the secretary was yet to take any action.
