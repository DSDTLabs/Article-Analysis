Navi Mumbai:   residents continue to suffer due to   piled up on roadsides, as there is a shortage of bins to cater to the waste generated due to irregular collection. Residents allege that garbage is accumulating since last weekend after   celebration as   failed to streamline the disposal system. 

 Mangal Kamble, an activist said, “Garbage is a perennial problem. Cidco has never lived up to the citizens’ expectations as far as providing basic civic amenities is concerned.”
 
 The officials from the sanitary wing of Cidco said that the pile up happened as the workers had a holiday. 
 
 “There is a backlog from Monday and we need two more days to resolve the problem as the agency has been asked to provide additional staff and vehicles to collect trash,” said a Cidco official.
