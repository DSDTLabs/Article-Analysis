NEW DELHI:   chairman Prasoon Joshi said on Tuesday that Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Padmavat’ had been granted a U/A certificate after the filmmakers incorporated the changes suggested to it and dismissed reports of any more changes in the film.

 “The makers have submitted the final film with agreed five modifications. These modifications have tried to incorporate observations and suggestions given by the advisory panel and also in keeping with the sentiments of society. This has already been communicated by   and a UA certificate has been been given to the film,” Joshi said in a statement.
 
 The controversial movie, based on Malik Mohammed Jaisi’s ballad ‘Padmavat’, is scheduled to be released on January 25.
 
 Taking exception to news reports that the Board had suggested up to 300 cuts in the film, Joshi expressed disappointment that CBFC was being dragged into the controversy repeatedly. “CBFC’s process is complete and any further news about cuts etc is absolutly untrue. Let’s refrain from utilising CBFC’s name unnecessarily,” Joshi said.
 
 The Deepkia Padukone starrer, which was scheduled to release on December 1 last year, has been at the centre of a raging controversy with Rajput protestors from across the country alleging that the film distorts history and shows Rajput women in poor light.
 
 Though Bhansali submitted before a Parliamentary panel that the film is fictional, the Rajput Karni Sena has threatened violence if the film is released, prompting the Rajasthan government to announce on Tuesday that the film will not be released in the state.
