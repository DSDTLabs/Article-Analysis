DARBHANGA: District magistrate   imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the   (CO) of   and   police station SHO for remaining absent during the district level public grievance redressal cell hearing on Friday. 

 The DM has also asked Biraul SDO and the SSP to initiate disciplinary action against Ghanshyampur CO and the SHO respectively for negligence in duty. 
 
 Singh said while hearing the appeal of Ranjit Ram from Lagma under Ghanshyampur block of Biraul subdivision, he was told that the CO failed to hand over possession of land to Ram despite giving homestead land paper under the Bhudan scheme. “Ram had to go for second appeal and during the hearing, the CO did not appear to clarify the position even after receiving notice. This amounts to negligence in duty. Hence, he was fined,” the DM said. 
 
 Taking a broad view of the situation, he has asked the SDO and SDPO of Biraul subdivision to hand over possession to those having valid papers of homestead land. 
 
 In the SHO case, he did not lodge an FIR for demanding extortion from one K K Mishra, who filed a complaint against him in the grievance redressal cell. 
 
 The SHO did not appear at the hearing and was fined. 
 
 It is to be noted that the marketing officers of two blocks and circle officer of Jale block had been fined for negligence in duty. They are also facing disciplinary action.
