MANALI: The ongoing widening work on Chandigarh-Manali national highway will soon reduce the travel time between the two places to about 6 hours. However, the joy ride on the new highway will end with a nightmare as Manali, with narrow connecting roads leading to it, will become a traffic bottleneck.

 The highway is being four-laned and double-laned till Manali. Though the carrying capacity of the national highway will increase, the government has not thought of increasing carrying capacity of roads leading to this popular tourist destination. The link roads of Manali are already unable to deal with the current traffic load. Safe and wider NH will encourage tourists to come to Manali by road, only to get stuck in long traffic jams as was seen here during the New Year eve when record 4,000 tourist vehicles outside the state had entered the town in one single day.
 
 Roads to famous Hidimba temple, Old Manali, Vashisht, Log Hut area,   and Naggar are too narrow to allow two vehicles at one time. Despite being major tourist attractions, the government never planned to build new roads and widen existing ones in Manali. Besides, encroachment at some places has shrunk the roads. Now, when Manali expects to receive tourist crowd due to better road connectivity in the next five years, residents expect new wide roads for smooth vehicular movement.
 
  (PWD) sub-divisional officer P K Rana said it was difficult to widen the existing roads. “We are trying to do so at some portions, but some areas have thick forest and at some the land is privately owned land. The town is already congested, there is no space for any kind of construction. We are still looking for possibility for new roads.” 
 
 Forest, transport and sports minister  , who is MLA from Manali, said the infrastructure of town will be developed in a planned manner. “New parking and roads would be built. Alternate options would be discovered if road connectivity is not possible at any place,” he said.
