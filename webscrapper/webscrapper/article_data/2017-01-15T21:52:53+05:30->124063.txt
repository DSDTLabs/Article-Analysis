KOLKATA: For safety's sake, many show organisers in Bengal are now opting for bamboo barricades separating the sexes. Since safety is a concern, artistes have had to accept the Victorian ways. But there is also a question that is now being asked - is this new system a perfect way of hosting a rock show?

 According to  , frontman of Fossils, it is difficult to tabulate what exactly is the "perfect" way to host a rock show. "For an entertainer, it doesn't matter where or how a programme is organised. A rockstar has to propagate a certain philosophy. Rock is a lifestyle and it stands for freedom of existence. We often don't get the ideal environment for a rock show. There are listeners seated in the front rows. Yet, we accept all this as long our philosophy of rock is propagated," he said.
 
 To fit into the changed scenario, Rupam, has introduced a mock-fight between girls and boys on who can sing louder. "On stage, I also use humour to register my protest when I see this gender divider. But honestly speaking, I don't support this sexist arrangement," Rupam said.
