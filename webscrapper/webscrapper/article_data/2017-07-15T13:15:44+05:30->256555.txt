NAGPUR:The state government has extended the timeline for banks to provide an advance credit of Rs10,000 to   who have defaulted on earlier loans, making them ineligible for fresh credit. Earlier, the scheme was applicable till July 15 but a government resolution (GR) issued on Friday extended the time till August 31.

 The idea is to give partial relief to farmers till their loans are waived and they get full-fledged finance from the banks again. The amount provided as advance will be adjusted against the loan waiver.
 
 Kishore Tiwari, director of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), said the date was extended since banks have not yet begun granting the amount to farmers.
 
 The first notification was issued on June 14. The earlier order had a long list of eligibility conditions to ensure that beneficiaries had no source of income except agriculture. One of the conditions was that no one in the immediate family should own a car. This conditions was later removed.
