Ludhiana: While the Ludhiana police have launched a campaign against crash guards and bull bars on vehicles, ever since the   and Highways imposed a ban on them, it seems official cars are exempt from this ban order. The official car of the city’s first citizen, deputy commissioner  , and other vehicles of the district administration have the guards and bars still installed on them, even a month after the ban, but no challan has been issued to them. A crash guard was also found installed on a vehicle in the cavalcade of cabinet minister  , who was in the city today to attend a programme.

 Speaking to TOI on the issue,   Traffic   said: “We have launched a campaign against the use of bull bars and crash guards on vehicles, and we are issuing challans regularly to offenders. So far, no case of any government official’s vehicle having installed them has come to my notice, but if we come across any such vehicle, we will take action, as the law is equal for everyone.”
 
 Motorists get bull bars and metal crash guards installed on their vehicles mostly as a fancy accessory to flaunt their money power, and in some cases to prevent damage to headlights and bumpers, little knowing that they are endangering their lives, as the guards are known to obstruct the opening of airbags in case of a road crash. Even now, these accessories are openly available at several shops in Ludhiana, and are still being fixed on vehicles without any check.
