UDAIPUR: Though many criticised his demonetisation move, Prime Minister   claims the step has proved effective in bringing all the black money out.

 The 64-year-old retired school teacher, who was in Udaipur on Wednesday to attend golden jubilee celebration of a private school at  , said, “Modi ji has taken the correct step on notebandi. The banning of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has brought out all the black money from all over the country,“ Jashodaben said while addressing the audience. Jashodaben, who began her speech with `Vande Mataram', said that women from poor families are benefiting after Modi's appeal for voluntary surrender of gas subsidy. This has enabled the government to give free   below poverty line.
 
 Urging the women to attain self reliance, she said when Sushma Swaraj, Mayawati and Indira Gandhi can go ahead, why not the rest of the women folk in the country should step ahead and work? Pleased by the cultural performances of the students, Jashodaben even awarded them a cash prize of Rs 2,000.
