 Suresh says, “I couldn’t believe when I got to known that I got the award. It is a rare achievement as only two artistes from   have got this award this year. Artistes don't work keeping recognition in mind, but it sure motives us to be creative. The Civil War-II painting depicts the internal struggle humans have with their own negative qualities and can be represented as humanities fight against against evil forces in society as well.” Suresh, who also works as a drawing teacher, adds, “Being with children helps me be more creative, as they are the ones who do art in a simplified, easy and flexible way.”
  
  Being creative from his childhood days,   says that it was not easy to follow his passion in arts, but that he had support from his family members to convert his dream into reality. The artiste, who conducted his first solo show recently, plans to do more such shows this year in   and other cities as well.
  
  Speaking about his next art work, ‘Movement of The Life,’ he says, “It highlights the helplessness of people in society in dealing with issues like corruption, rape and decline in social responsibility.” Interestingly, most of his art works have a social connect. He says, "Artistes have a key role to play in the betterment of society. They should not be limited by four walls.”
