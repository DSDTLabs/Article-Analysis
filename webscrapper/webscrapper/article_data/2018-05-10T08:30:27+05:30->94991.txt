LUDHIANA:   between Delhi and Ludhiana is set to start soon.   website suggests that the flight from Delhi to Ludhiana and to Kullu and Shimla will start from May 30 and the tickets have been sold up to June 4.

 As per the time-table, the flight will take off from Delhi at 5.10am and reach the   airport at 6.40am. The fare will be Rs 2,050 under the Udaan Scheme. After that the plane will fly to Shimla at 7am. It will take off from the   capital for Ludhiana at 8.05am and land at Sahnewal at 8.40am.

 The Airport Authority of India officials at Ludhiana said they got the schedule three days ago.
 
 The airport’s acting director  , however, said, “Air Deccan is yet to inform the Sahnewal airport when it is starting the flight.”
 
 He added that Air Deccan was likely to fly DN 102 (Beechcraft 1900D) aircraft that could carry 19 passengers.
 
 The flights have city residents on cloud nine.
 
 “Among the hill stations, Kullu, Manali, Shimla and Kashmir are my favourite. It is a wonderful news that a flight between Ludhiana and Shimla and Kullu is starting and will take us there in less than an hour. I plan to go to Kullu in June,” said Raj Kumar, a trader.
 
 But many industrialists are not happy with the timings. “The flight should have taken off from Ludhiana at 9am and reached Delhi at 10.30am, so that we could meet our clients and return by second flight in the evening. If this flight reaches Delhi at 12.50pm and the second flight from Delhi is within next two to three hours, what work can we do? We all know about the Delhi traffic,” said industrialist  .
