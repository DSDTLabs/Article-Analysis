PANAJI: Those aspiring to directly become deputy superintendent of police ( ) in Goa police will have to wait for some more time as the file pertaining to recruitment has “got stuck due to technical reasons”.

  ( ) has sent back the file to the government to reconstitute a direct recruitment committee which the government had constituted as a ‘promotion committee’ for direct recruitment.
 
 Sources said that there are two committees; one is for direct recruitment and the second for promotion. The promotion committee is chaired by the GPSC chairman and its member is the chief secretary. Direct recruitment comes under the GPSC chairman. “The government has constituted a promotion committee instead of direct recruitment and the file has been moved back to the government for correction,” a source said.
 
 The other issues due to which the file has been stuck is because the government has recommended selection grade to the post of DySP. A source said the Goa civil service rules was amended last year to include a fifth pay scale for the Goa civil service and now the same grade pay is also recommended to the police and the approval is pending before the chief secretary.
 
 On October 16, 2017, the state government approved the direct recruitment of 15 DySPs into the force. TOI had reported in May 2017 that the state government had initiated the process of filling 50% of DySP posts through direct recruitment. Out of the 15 posts approved, nine are for general category, two for Scheduled Tribe candidates, while four are for other backward category ( ) candidates.
 
 In 1997, the state government had directly recruits six DySPs, some of whom were subsequently inducted into the Indian Police Service. Some have been promoted as Superintendent of Police (SP).
 
 In 2012, the state government had initiated a similar exercise when   became chief minister, but the process couldn't be completed as senior police officers protested against the move.
