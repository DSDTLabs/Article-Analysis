Album:   
Genre: Bollywood 
 Rahul Dholakia’s 'Raees' is an action crime thriller, but the three tracks that have released from the film promise variety. The first number to hit the stands was 'Laila Main Laila'. In the voice of Pawni Pandey, the recreated version of ' ' ('Qurbani') sounds peppy and quirky.   has replaced the original interludes of percussion and strings with saxophone, but has more or less retained the flavour. We also like how the subtle drum beats add character to the track. Next in line is JAM8’s 'Zaalima', which showcases   at his romantic best. The melody is striking, and   and   stand out in the number, which gives the word   (oppressor) a poetic twist. The latest release, 'Udi Udi Jaye', has the ever-energetic Sukhwinder Singh headlining it, with   and Karsan Sagathia complementing him. A garba-kind of number, it alternates between fast and slow beats, and even has a folksy touch with Gujarati lyrics in the interlude. We aren’t sure if the album will add to the film’s storyline, but it will definitely find a place in the top songs of 2017.
