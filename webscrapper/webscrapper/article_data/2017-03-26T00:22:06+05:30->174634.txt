THANE: A part of the district   may be shifted to the vacant   at Ram Maruti Road after a part of the existing court premises at Court Naka was declared dangerous and unsafe by a Bombay High Court-appointed committee. 

 District Judge SM Gavhane, collector Mahendra Kalyankar and additional municipal commissioner Sunil Chavan conducted a site visit of the 4,500 sq ft ground-plus-two storied Warkari Bhuvan on Friday along with members of bar council.
 
 Chavan told TOI that members of the infrastructure committee of the HC met the TMC last week and requested them to identify a make-shift court premises till the time the repairs are undertaken and the structure is declared safe for use. 
 
 “They (the court authorities) will require the building for a period of at least six months till the structure is repaired and is safe for use,” Chavan informed TOI.
 
 After a structural audit of the 50-yeear-old building by the PWD department, the building was tagged C-1 structure, which means that repairs are required after vacating the building urgently.
 
 Subsequently, the court authorities swung in action and requested the TMC for a make shift arrangement.
 
 Chavan told TOI that statutory powers to grant the permission for using the Warkari Bhuvan lies with the general body and a proposal would be put up for clearance, which would most likely be cleared.
