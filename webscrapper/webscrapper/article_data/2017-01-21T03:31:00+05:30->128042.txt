Margao: Urging the electorate to vote and elect her as their representative,   Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) candidate Rakhi Naik on Friday released a four-page election manifesto in Marathi at a Margao-based hotel.

 Naik had recently quit NCP claiming to be aggrieved with the leadership side lining the loyal women workers at the time of filing nominations. Naik had also told reporters at a recently held Goa Vikas Party (GVP) press briefing that she had informed NCP party president Sharad Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule, who had given her blessings to Naik’s decision to be the GVP Sanguem candidate.
 
 Regarding her ‘homecoming’ to the NCP, Naik said she changed her mind after she was informed by state NCP leaders that her name had been cleared for the Sanguem seat. 
 
 To a query regarding a possible split in votes between Congress and NCP benefiting BJP, Naik said she was confident of victory. 
 
 The NCP candidate further told TOI that she had her own identity having campaigned for the 2012 Sanguem NCP candidate Yuri Alemao.
