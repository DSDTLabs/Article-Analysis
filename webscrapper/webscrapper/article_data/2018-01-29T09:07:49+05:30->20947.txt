VIJAYAWADA: The differences between the   and the TDP are getting wider, with leaders from both parties blaming each other for not following the coalition dharma. A day after chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said they will walk out of the coalition if the BJP does not want to continue further, BJP leaders   and   accused the TDP of not following coalition norms. Veerraju said they will not forget the betrayal of TD in Kakinada municipal polls.

 The latest controversy was triggered by BJP MLC Vishnukumar Raju, who shared dais with YSRC leader   in the assembly, and opposed giving ministries to MLAs who defected from YSRC. Raju even demanded that those who won on YSRC ticket, and enjoyed cabinet rank, should resign and seek fresh mandate, or else the government should bring a new law to allow such members to be made cabinet ministers.
 
 Raju's comments irked TDP leaders across the state. They expressed their displeasure over Raju for sharing stage with YSRC leaders even though it was for a press conference, commenting on MLAs who joined TDP from other parties. Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu himself came out in open after he returned from   tour, and said he is refraining himself and his party cadres not to criticise the BJP, respecting coalition dharma. Escalating the rift between two parties, BJP leaders also come out strongly against the TDP, on Sunday. MLC Somu Veerraju said they have been silent even though the state government is propagating the Union government's schemes as their own.
