Raj Chakrabarty’s wedding has taken the whole film industry by surprise, and sitting in faraway US, another director has vouched not to be lonely. I don’t know what got to him but gossip mongers in   tell me   expressed the desire to marry   one more time, though his relationship with debutante   is talked about in hushed whispers. Jaya first worked with Srijit in Rajkahini and that she stole his heart is no secret. Thereafter the duo kept in touch as friends, not lovers, since Srijit was already dating another young actress and there were rumours that Jaya was in a relationship. Now that she’s working with him again in Ek Je Chhilo Raja, Srijit, I hear, wants to make things work with her. Is Jaya ready? Only she can tell.
