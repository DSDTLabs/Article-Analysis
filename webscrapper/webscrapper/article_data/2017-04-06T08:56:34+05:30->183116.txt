NEW DELHI: A day after a Facebook video post showing Delhi Police officers stopping an   carrying an ailing child from Sonepat to allow   movement near   went viral on the internet, the family of the child has been traced to a hospital in  .

 The child, Varsha (7), is suffering from   and needed priority medical attention for survival. She is currently admitted in the ICU of a private hospital.
 
 Her father, Jai Bhagwan, said that they had left home in Sonepat around 8am for Faridabad. They took the Ring Road to go towards Badarpur border, but were caught in a snarl at Rajghat. 
 
 “Fellow motorists told us that the road was closed for VVIP movement. Our ambulance driver then tried to request people ahead of us to allow passage, but no one moved,” he said.
 
 “Soon, a group of youths helped us and requested the cops to clear the road. It took us nearly 30 minutes to convince people to let us drive up to the barricade,” said Bhagwan, who was accompanied by his wife. Bhagwan is a peon with a private university in Sonepat.
 
 Varsha was bleeding from the nose and that worried her parents. “Every minute seemed like an hour. Seeing our desperation, the youths who helped us started arguing with the cops. We were finally allowed to go when they forced the cops to open the barricade. Had it not been for the youths, we would have been stuck for long,” Bhagwan said.
 
 Delhi Police spokesperson Dependra Pathak said that ambulance movement is top priority even during VVIP movement. “We got to know through media about the issue at Rajghat and have started an inquiry. Initial probe shows that a few minutes before the VIP movement, the traffic was stopped. The ambulance was towards the end and the cops facilitated the ambulance to come forward to the barricade,” he said.
 
 “The moment the VIP cavalcade left Rajghat, the ambulance was the first vehicle to leave. The ambulance was not stopped for more than three minutes,” said Pathak.
