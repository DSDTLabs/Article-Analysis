AMRITSAR: Sikhs have hailed a Delhi court's decision to make 1984 anti-Sikh riots accused and Congress leader   undergo a lie-detector test, saying it has rekindled their hope for justice and punishment to perpetrators of one of the most violent riots that took place in India after Independence.

 Hoping that the court's decision would set a precedent, the community has now de manded that every person who has been named in the killings in Delhi should be made to undergo lie-detector tests. On a request by the   (CBI), a Delhi court had on Thursday ordered a lie-detector test on Tytler in a case pertaining to killing of three Sikhs in the aftermath of riots that broke out following the assassination of then Prime Minister   by her bodyguards on October 31, 1984.
 
 Shiromani   (SGPC) additional secretary   told TOI on Friday that the order would at least move the case which had been lying dormant for years. “Why only Tytler? Others whose names had figured in the ruthless killing should also be ordered to undergo the test.“
