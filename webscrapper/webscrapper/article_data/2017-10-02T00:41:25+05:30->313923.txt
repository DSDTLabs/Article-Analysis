Thanjavur: Police arrested three persons and are on the lookout for one more, who attempted to steal a two-foot  , from a Mariamman temple near Sethubavachathram in Thanjavur district during the wee hours of Sunday.

 The four-member gang had planned to steal the idol thinking that it was a panchaloha idol, but their plan was foiled as the villagers caught hold of one of the culprits when they tried to escape. 
 
 According to police, the Mariamman temple situated at Oomathanadu village near Sethubavachathiram is considered to be a hundred years old. The trustees of the temple preserved the bronze idol of Utsavar, the deity taken during temple festival processions, for many years. The idol had been kept safely outside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.
 
 On Sunday, a four-member gang entered the temple by breaking open the front door. Villagers residing near the temple woke up after hearing some weird sound and saw the miscreants running from the temple. They chased them and caught hold of one and informed the Peravurani police, who in turn rushed to the spot and conducted an inquiry with the villagers and the accused.
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed the man caught was Periyasami, 30, of Pookollai Raghunathapuram near Sethupavachathram. On the basis of the information provided by him, police learnt that the other were Sathyaraj, 30, of Mangudi near Aranthangi in Pudukottai district, Karthiban, 35, of Kainavayal, from a nearby village and Satheesh, 34 of Mudathikadu. They had parked their vehicle a few meters away from the temple and entered the temple by foot. As residents began to chase them, they had abandoned the idol on a farmland and fled the scene on their two-wheelers.
 
 Police arrested Sathyaraj and Karthiban within few hours and the search was on to nab Satheesh. According to police, the idol was made of bronze. But the accused had stolen it thinking that it was a panchaloha idol. Police have registered a case and are investigating.
