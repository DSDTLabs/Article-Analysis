Lucknow: Declared as intangible cultural   by   in 2016, the tradition of ‘Mangal Sobhajatra’, a dawn procession on the first day of the Bengali New year or Poila Baishakh had faded away a few years ago. This time, Bengali Club is making efforts to revive the age-old practice.

 Until five years ago, the procession used to be a vibrant affair with Bengalis from across the city gathering early in the morning to celebrate their new year amid folk music and dance.
 
 Commonly called ‘Prabhat Pheris’, people from the community have fond memories of the sought after procession. 
 
 “People used to dance and sing all through the way. Some even had a harmonium around their shoulder and played music. AP Sen’s ‘Nutan Barash   Barash Anchale O Ki Dhaka’ was a song without which the procession was never complete,” said Bengali Club president Arun Banerjee.
 
 “My mother and sisters would get new clothes just for the procession. We used to meet all our relatives and friends there,” recalled Shubroto Sinha.
 
 There are around 2 lakh Bengalis in the city. Most have witnessed the   procession and want it to start all over again.
 
 “I want my children to get acquainted with Bengali rituals and practices. The procession was something all families took part in, in the most culturally authentic way,” said Arunima Bhattacharya, a homemaker. 
 
 Bengali families are scattered across the city now unlike when they all used to stay around Hussainganj, added Arunima.
 
 “It is difficult to bring everyone on a common ground. We have circulated information among everyone that the procession is going to happen again on ,” she added.
