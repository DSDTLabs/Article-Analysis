HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum has directed a private overseas educational services firm to pay 1 lakh to a consumer for failing to refund the amount she paid to secure a medical seat for her son in  . 

 In her submission to the forum, B  , the complainant, stated she approached   to secure an MBBS seat for her son in a foreign country. The firm, she said, agreed to facilitate the same at an university in Georgia, at a cost of 2 lakh. 
 
 While the complainant said that she had informed the firm - at the time of the transaction - about her son being confident of securing a seat through   and the firm, in turn, had assured to refund the paid amount in case the candidate did get a medical seat in the counselling, it failed to honour the promise. 
 
 Sirisha paid 75,000 as advance to the firm and submitted all original certificates along with   card. 
 
 The complainant stated that she decided to approach the forum, after the firm returned the certificates but did not refund the money. The opposite party refused to receive the notice of the forum and was set ex parte. 
 
 Referring to documents given by the Bhagyalaxmi Educational Services, the bench, observed that they categorically stated that the amount would be refunded if the boy was selected in NEET. "Also, by documents presented it is clear that he has secured a seat here. In such circumstances, the opposite party is bound to refund the amount, but they kept on postponing the matter and this would certainly come under the category of deficiency in service and unfair trade practice," the bench said, directing the firm to not just refund the advance payment but also pay 20,000 as compensation and another 5,000 towards cost of complaint to the consumer.
