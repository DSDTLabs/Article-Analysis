BENGALURU: What started as a personal mission to add meaning to her life has today blossomed into a   in Malleswaram. However,  , 86, is in no mood to rest. She has raised Rs 13 lakh through a   platform to help build another old-age home.

 It was in 1994-95 that   came up in Malleswaram to cater to the needs of those aged between 60 and 91. “Many people, particularly women, were searching for a home. They had either been abandoned by their families or had nobody else to turn to. Now, we have a 100x100 plot in Banashankari that the BDA gave us in 2012, recognizing our efforts. But the builder has quoted almost Rs 4 crore as cost of construction. We have been trying to raise funds through public donations and acquaintances for six years. People have contributed Rs 13 lakh through the crowdfunding platform Milaap,” she said.
 
 While the home in Malleswaram functions only out of a few rooms, with two to three occupants sharing space and amenities, the one in Banashankari will have 26 rooms, including separate dormitories for men and women. Apart from Saroja, the staffers include helpers and counsellers. The medical costs of the women are met by Shankari Sandhya Sadhana.
 
 A native of Chitradurga, Saroja was motivated to set up the home after the untimely demise of her son and then her husband soon after.
