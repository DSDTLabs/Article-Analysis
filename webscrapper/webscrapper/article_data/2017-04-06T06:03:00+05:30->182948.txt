BANKURA: The 17-acre   fish farm at Hooghly’s Goghat will be acquired for the railway project, chief minister   said on Wednesday. The project will connect pilgrim spots at Bishnupur, Joyrambati, Kamarpukur and Tarakeswar. 

 A section of fish farm owners, who refused compensation cheques, have been agitating at Goghat against “forcible acquisition of the pond”. The owners had decided that they won’t allow any railway line to be laid across the area where the pond is located.
 
 Taking a dig at CPM for siding with those protesting acquisition of the pond, the CM said, “There is no need to instigate owners of the fish farm at Bhaba Dighi. Come what may, this railway project must go ahead. I will go out of my way to accommodate needs of the fish farmers. I will give them alternative land for a fish farm and provide them with modern fishing equipment — free of cost.”
 
 Addressing a meeting at Bankura, she said, “I had initiated this project as railway minister. Just as one can travel to several religious places from Ajmer Sharif in Rajasthan, I had wanted railway connectivity between Bishnupur, Joyrambati, Kamarpukur and Tarakeswar for the benefit of pilgrims. I am asking you to help with this project. I will provide an alternative for the fish farm’s owners. But I will not tolerate any further resistance to the project.”
 
 Lakshmi Ray, who has been leading the agitation against acquisition of the pond, said, “We have heard the CM’s statement on TV. We will hold a meeting and find out what majority are saying.”
