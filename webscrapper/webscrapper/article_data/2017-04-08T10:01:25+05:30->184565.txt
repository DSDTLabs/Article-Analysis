NEW DELHI: For many, it seemed like a declaration of war, not just against   but also against  , but for some Syrians, the US unleashing its Tomahawks on their country was what just the doctor ordered.

 On Thursday night, Trump ordered missile strikes on a Syrian airbase in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons on civilians by the Assad regime.
 
 Both Russia and Syria condemned the attack. Russian President Putin calling it "aggression against a sovereign state in violation of the norms of international law". The strike, involving nearly 60 Tomahawk missiles, focused mainly on airfields, carefully avoiding casualties to Russian personnel embedded in Syria.
 
 Still, the world's capitals held their collective breath weighing whether this was the start of another period of confrontation and proxy wars between Moscow and Washington.
