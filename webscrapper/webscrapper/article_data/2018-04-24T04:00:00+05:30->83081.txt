Surat: Hundreds of farmers in nine talukas of Surat district are still awaiting disbursement of subsidy amount and approval of applications for purchase of agricultural equipment under government schemes.  In a shocking revelation under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, over 50 per cent farmers are yet to get the benefit of subsidy on agriculture equipment in Surat district. Out of the total 16,900 applications submitted in 2017-18, over 9,500 applications are yet to be accepted by the government. This means the farmers who had purchased agricultural equipment are yet to get their subsidy amount sanctioned by the state government.  A central government scheme launched in coordination with the state government to facilitate farmers to buy agricultural machinery by offering attractive subsidy has many takers in the district. Under this scheme, government has enlisted 20 heads of agricultural machinery, which include tractor, harrow, rotavator, seed drill, irrigation pump set, cultivator, land leveller, sprinkler set, rain gun, thresher, power weeder, drum seeder etc.  The amount of subsidy varies from Rs 4,000 to Rs 1.50 lakh depending on the type of machinery and its original selling price. Sayan Sugar Factory director Darshan Naik, who sought details under RTI, said, “Majority of farmers have done online registration for taking subsidy benefit for tractor, pump sets, drip irrigation and cultivator. More than 50 per cent of the applications are yet to be accepted and that the subsidy amount is not disbursed. On one hand, the government talks about farmers’ prosperity and on the other, it is not giving subsidy to support agriculture. I have written to chief minister Vijay Rupani requesting him to disburse the subsidy amount to all the farmers at the earliest.”
