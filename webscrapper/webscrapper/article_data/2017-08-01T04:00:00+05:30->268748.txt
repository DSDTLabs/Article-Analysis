Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is looking to hold a national Smart City Conference in September.

 The event is being planned to mark the anniversary of inclusion of Vadodara in the Smart City list last year. “We want to take the initiative of bringing together civic body functionaries from across the country on this occasion,” said VMC commissioner Vinod Rao.
 
 Rao added that the best practices adopted by cities selected as Smart Cities will be discussed on the occasion. Various projects taken up by the Smart Cities will also be highlighted at the event.
 
 The civic body is looking to time the event in such a way that it coincides with the Navratri festival. The festival will also be promoted during the event and the visitors will be taken to prominent garba venues in the city.
