LUDHIANA:  's order banning serving of liquor in hotels, bars and restaurants located in the radius of 500 metres of state and   has sent jitters to the hospitality industry of Ludhiana. 

 More than 100 hotels, bars, restaurants and marriage palaces located on or near highways have been debarred from serving liquor to their customers from April 1. Ever since the news broke in the morning, panic gripped management of all such establishments and they started lifting the stock of liquor from their bars and restaurants.
 
 City's prominent hotels including five star hotels all of which are located on highways withdrew the facility of mini bar service in the rooms. Ravneet Guram, spokesperson of a city's five star hotel, Hyatt Regency, said, "We have stopped serving liquor in our hotel from today, be it in banquet hall, bar or rooms."
 
 Already 147 liquor vends located on or near highways have been permanently closed by the excise and taxation department, but the department is yet to identify all other types of establishments which fall under the purview of this ban.
 
 Speaking to TOI, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC), Ludhiana, J K Jain said, "We will ensure full compliance of orders of Supreme Court and officers have already been instructed to take the required action."
 
 However, Jain refused to share details of how many hotels, restaurants, bars and marriage palaces have been banned for serving liquor. But sources in the department said the number can be as high as 140 in the entire district.
 
 Meanwhile, the businessmen are disappointed over the latest development as they are of the view that it will destroy the hospitality business.
