 INLD has announced that workers will stop all vehicles from going to Punjab via the  . The party is demanding that the SC order clearing the path for the construction of Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal be implemented at the earliest. Except for vehicles like ambulances or those in emergency, INLD activists would stop all vehicles, INLD leader Abhay Chautala had said last week.
 
 Haryana home secretary Ram Niwas said, "We have discussed all issues in detail. Some diversions too have been proposed. We are fully prepared and will ensure that law and order situation remains under control and there is smooth passage of traffic on July 10. We have asked for 10 companies of paramilitary, and if required we shall send requisition for additional security personnel."
 
 Haryana police officials also indicated that some road diversions could be made if the INLD activists reached the National Highway-1 (NH-1) and tried to block it near Ambala, some 45km from Chandigarh.
 
 Those travelling from Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh towards New Delhi have to pass through Haryana. NH-1 connects Amritsar with New Delhi.
 
 Chautala said their plan was still on. "We will stop all vehicles including those of MLAs and MPs from Punjab. We will stop private vehicles as well but would allow them after our workers distribute our pamphlets justifying the need for SYL canal for Haryana," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Haryana education minister Ram Bilas Sharma has asked INLD to withdraw its call. He said the party should participate in the dialogue process to resolve the issue.
