MADURAI: A man and his friends allegedly hacked a textile shop owner and two others at Sellur in the city on Saturday after the owner refused to give discount on their purchase. Police have arrested two accused involved in the attack and are on the lookout for two more persons. 

 Police said S Neethi, 45, a resident of Ahimsapuram near Sellur, went to a textile shop located on 50 Feet Road at Sellur on Saturday and purchased garments for 2,200. Neethi asked for a discount, which the shop owner JaferHussain, of Mahaboobapalayam, rejected. When the customer insisted, he agreed to give them a small discount. However, Neethi kept on demanding for a bigger discount. This resulted in a dispute between the shop owner and the customer, during which the customer tried to slip out with the clothes without paying the bill. 
 
 Police said  , along with shopkeepers of a neighbouring textile shop, managed to stop Neethi and recovered the clothes. They also allegedly assaulted the customer. 
 
 Neethi, who left the place then, returned to the same shop at 9.30pm with three more persons. They picked up a quarrel with the shop owner and his two friends from neighbouring shops. The accused then attacked Jafer and his friends Saddiq and Jagir Hussain with sharp weapons. All three sustained cut injuries to their head, hands, and wrists in the attack. They were immediately rushed to a nearby hospital, where are currently undergoing treatment.
 
 Based on complaint from Jafer Hussain, Sellur police conducted an inquiry. They have booked Neethi and his friends  , 23, J Sivabalan, 26 and Surya under Section 307 (attempt of murder) of IPC. While Prabakaran and Sivabalan have been arrested, police are searching for two more.
