Mumbai: The hawkish statement from the RBI’s last monetary policy meeting, which flagged concerns about a higher  , pushed   prices southward on Thursday. This caused the benchmark 10-year   to touch an over two-year high at 7.83% in intra-day trades before closing at 7.75% (prices of bonds and their yields have an inverse relationship).

 Concerns about elevated inflation levels in the US, which could be the result of the current government’s move to have a deficit-financed infrastructure-led growth, also made bond dealers here nervous, pushing up yields, market players said. In less than two months, the benchmark yield has hardened by nearly 60   (100 basis points = 1 percentage point). On January 5, the new benchmark 10-year government paper was introduced at 7.17%. And given the ground realities, bond dealers now expect it to go over the psychologically important 8% level soon.
