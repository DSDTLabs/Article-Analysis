NAGPUR: Books are generally released in a routine way, so to say. But the release of ‘Shuddh Vednanchi Gani’, a novel written by renowned author  , made a departure with actors performing live the characters in the book on stage that left a profound impact on the audience, at   hall, on Saturday.

 The programme was jointly organized by Vaidarbhiya Lekhika Sanstha ‘Abhivyakti’ and Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh.
 
 Iyer said, “The story binds the social and cultural happenings in the 20th century and modern times. Not much has changed during this period as we continue to suffer from emotional issues and void in life. It is a story of grief and greed.” 
 
 The novel talks about the grief princess   has of not becoming a mother. She has to face social stigma and abuses at home. As her grief clouds her sanity, she decides to have a child by hook or crook. 
 
 In order to keep her position as princess intact, Tulandar alias Urmila traps her widowed sister-in-law Avanti with a glib talk and asks her to come to her home. When Avanti gets a scent of Urmila’s sinister designs of getting her impregnated from an unknown man, she tries to escape, but is brutally and repeatedly raped for many days.
 
 After Avanti delivers a baby boy, Urmila takes him away with her, and warns Avanti to remain tight-lipped about the birth of a child for the rest of her life.
 
 As the years pass by, a young   becomes a spoilt man and later turns out to be an abusive husband and father.
 
 The story throws light on how bad fatherhood affects children in the family. It also highlights how father of a teenager girl marries her off to an elderly moneylender as he is unable to repay the loan he had taken.
 
 The story also focuses on superstition, belief in aghori babas in the name of God which was socially accepted by the society in the 19th and 20th century. 
 
 The actors did a wonderful job and portrayed the characters effectively.
 
 The play was directed by Ravindra Durugkar.
