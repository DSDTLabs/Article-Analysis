BHAGALPUR/SASARAM: Two minor girls were raped in two separate incidents in Naugachhia and   on Saturday.

 Police said a 14-year-old girl of a village under the Rangra police station area in Naugachhia district was abducted by her 17-year-old neighbour from a field when she was collecting grass. One of his friends helped him. The girl was later found abandoned by her sister and co-villagers in a cowshed.
 
 Police admitted the survivor to a local hospital for medical examination. An FIR was lodged on the basis of the statements of the girls.
 
 Naugachhia SP Nidhi Rani told TOI it was not a case of gang rape. “One boy raped the minor while the other was kept a watch on passers-by. The boys are also minors and hence we are withholding their names,” the SP said, adding the duo would be arrested and produced before a juvenile court.
 
 In Rohtas, a 10- year-old girl was raped by a 22-year-old neighbour in her house located under the   town police station area on Saturday afternoon.
 
 Sasaram DSP   said Mohd Naqeeb allegedly barged into the girl’s house when she was alone. Her father caught him red-handed after a while. Later, villagers thrashed the accused.
 
 An FIR has been lodged by the girl’s father. “The accused has been arrested. We will file a chargesheet in the case within a week,” the DSP said.
