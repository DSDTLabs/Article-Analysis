The world saw history in making when presenters   and   wrongly announced  's musical 'La La Land' as the winner of the Oscar for Best Picture, and later called on stage the team of 'Moonlight' to accept their award.

 
 
 While many are trying to wrap their head around it, social media went berserk with gifs and memes about the biggest goof-up till date on the Oscars stage.
 
 Addressing the mix-up, Best Actress Oscar winner  , who was at the backstage press conference, was quoted saying that she was holding her Best Actress card the whole time. "I also was holding my best actress in a leading role card [from the envelope] that entire time." She further added that she’d like to find out exactly why the mistake was made. “I’m not trying to start anything, but I’m not sure what happened, and I really wanted to talk to you guys first," she quipped. 
 
 Talking about ‘Moonlight’, the ‘La La Land’ actress said, "I f—ing love ‘Moonlight!’ God, I love ‘Moonlight’ so much! I’m so excited for ‘Moonlight.’ It was an amazing thing to hear ‘La La Land’ [named best picture] and of course we wanted to win. But we’re all so excited for ‘Moonlight.’ I think it’s one of the best films of all time, so I was pretty beside myself."
