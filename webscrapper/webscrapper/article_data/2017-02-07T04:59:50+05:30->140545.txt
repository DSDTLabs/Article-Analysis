MUMBAI: If you thought   only help motorists navigate their way, think again. Even policemen have begun using them to make their jobs quicker and easier.

 In a first, a four-member team from   landed on a marshy plot of land hidden amid a thick cover of mangroves in Shivneri, Rai village of Bhayander (west), using screenshots from Google Earth, on Saturday morning.Nearly 650 litres of hooch was destroyed. Villager Prakash Patil (40) was arrested.
 
 Clad in T-shirts, shorts and slippers, the cops used the satellite imaging and walked for about1.5 km in the dense mangrove jungle to track down an illicit liquor-brewing den.
 
 Police sub -inspector Sagar Chavan said they had information that illicit liquor was being brewed in the mangroves, but there was no information on the exact spot. “So, we used technology ,“ said Chavan.
 
 A look at Google Earth showed them four to white spots in the mangrove jungle. “ As the images showed white spots, we knew some activity was on there,“ said Chavan. After navigating through the mangroves for about 20 minutes, they reached the target spot.
 
 The police said that mang roves have been destroyed to set up distillation units. Most of the brewing and transporting is done at night using boats.
 
 Last month, the police carried out two raids on hoochbrewing dens in the creeks of Murdha and Kopra villages of Bhayander (west) and arrested three. After the Malwani hooch tragedy that killed 106 in 2015 , the police raided several dens in of Bhayander and Vasai.
