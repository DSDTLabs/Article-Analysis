NEW DELHI: With the objective of giving a boost to Narendra Modi government's plans for a massive infrastructure push,   has set an ambitious target, much more than what the state-run transporter has ever achieved in the past, for laying of new tracks, doubling, gauge conversion and electrification. 

 Railways is aiming at commissioning of 3,500 km new rail lines in the financial year 2017-18 while it has almost doubled the target for electrification of tracks by keeping it at 4,000 km in the current fiscal year. The national transporter has also raised the target for doubling of tracks to 1,400 km for 2017-18 fiscal even as railways has never in the past managed to do 1,000 km in a year.
 
 The infrastructure targets were scaled up after the national transporter managed to commission 2,855 km new lines and also exceeded the electrification target by electrifying more than 2,000 km in 2016-17.
 
 Often under attack for trains running late, the railways intends to decongest high density routes to ensure safe and timely running of trains. Currently, around 16% of the track is catering to 60% of the traffic which has resulted in choking of major trunk routes such as Delhi-Howrah, Delhi-Mumbai and Mumbai-Howrah.
