NEW DELHI: Dalit leader   on Friday denied making provocative speeches in Pune and inciting violence at the Koregaon   rally on January 1, saying that the charges against him were “politically motivated”. 

 The newly-elected Gujarat MLA said that he didn’t even support Maharashtra Bandh on January 3, called by Dalit outfits in protest against the violence at the rally. “Neither did I make any inflammatory speech nor did I take part in the bandh in Maharashtra. Ask any constitutional expert to analyse my speech and find anything that is derogatory,” Mevani said, adding that he was being targeted by BJP and RSS. 
 
 “Wouldn’t it offend Dalits across the country if a community leader is attacked,” he asked. On Thursday, an FIR was lodged against Mevani and JNU student Umar   for their “provocative speeches” at an event in Pune on December 31. 
 
 Questioning PM Modi’s silence over Dalit atrocities, Mevani said, “During Modi’s tenure, we saw death of Rohith Vemula, Una dalit flogging and imprisonment of Bhim Army leader Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan. But  , who claims to be an Ambedkarite, is silent. He must clarify his position on whether Dalits have the right to hold peaceful rallies.” 
 
 Mevani said he would hold ‘Yuva Hunkaar Rally’ on January 9 and “go to the PMO with the Manusmriti and the Constitution and ask him to choose between the two”. Khalid said he was in Pune during the Koregaon Bhima violence and his December 31 speech is available online.
 
 “The FIR against me and Mevani is an attempt to divert attention from those who attacked people in the January 1 Koregaon Bhima rally,” said Khalid.
