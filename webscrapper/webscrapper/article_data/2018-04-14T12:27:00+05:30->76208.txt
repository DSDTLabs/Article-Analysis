HYDERABAD: There is no let up in   frauds as   police claim to be receiving complaints in which victims do not receive the one time passwords (OTPs) but money gets transferred from their bank accounts. In fact, the number of OTP frauds, which recorded a high incidence last year, continued to see a surge in 2018.

 In nearly 7 per cent of the OTP fraud cases, the victims have complained that though they did not receive the OTP in messages, their money was transferred from their accounts. “In most of the cases, the victims themselves reveal the OTP to fraudsters. But, in some cases which we have received, the fraudsters are using coding to bypass the OTP of banks and transferring money without the knowledge of the victims," said S Harinath, ACP (cyber crime), Rachakonda.
 
 According to a city-based ethical hacker, 60 per cent of the fraudsters are into spamming or infecting the users by sending phishing links and stealing the credit/debit card details. “The fraudster chooses 3D international gateway sites where the victim won’t be receiving OTP. They will only have to give card details,  , etc,” said the hacker.
 
 In a recent case of a 30-yearold professor, the   said the victim who gave away his card details through a phishing link, did not receive OTP. However, he received messages of two transactions of Rs 50,000 from his account.
 
 “It is hard to tell how the accused managed to bypass the OTP process. However, we are suspecting the offender must have access to the mobile data of the victim by hacking into his phone,” said the ACP. Most of the victims who purchase from   are falling prey to such frauds.
