COLVA: Two independent MLAs and   from Salcete who stood by the   seem to be finding it difficult to garner support for a re-election. 

 Fisheries minister Avertano Furtado,   and Caetano ‘Caitu’ Silva had steadfastedly supported the BJP-led government even when a section of Xastikars wanted them to withdraw their support when their sentiments were hurt. Francisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco made a noise of withdrawing support but never submitted a letter to the governor. He also served as RDA minister .
 
 The people in Salcete erupted in protest against the BJP government’s reluctance to introduce the medium of instruction (MoI) bill in the assembly as promised. 
 
 BJP’s then alliance partner, MGP’s Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar made statements supporting India as a ‘Hindu Rashtra’. The following Sunday, priests took to the pulpit to express their sentiments following which various gram sabhas in Salcete adopted resolutions against the demand and urged the four Catholic MLAs to withdraw support to the BJP but they did not. The four MLAs were then nicknamed ‘Altar Boys’ of the BJP government.
 
 Subsequently came the demand from the same MGP minister demanding a ban on women wearing bikinis on the beaches and pub cultures. This incited the Catholic community from the Salcete coastal belt. Then came the statement from deputy chief minister Francis D’souza who went on record to say that he is a ‘Hindu-Christian’ again rattling the emotions of the minority in Salcete.
 
 Today the same MLAs face re-elections. Furtado said, “There is resentment among my voters about me not withdrawing support to the BJP government but I have explained the situation to them.”
 
 Caitu is in denial and said he did not support the BJP government but GVP has already given its letter of support.
