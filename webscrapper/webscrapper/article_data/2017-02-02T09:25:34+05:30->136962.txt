LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh may look forward to at least 200 specialists and 50 super specialists in a few years following Union Government’s decision to strengthen the secondary and tertiary level   service. 

 This will be possible with the creation of 5,000 additional   in the country as announced in the   on Wednesday. 
 
 In addition, national board of examination will be rolling out a plan to add PG seats in government hospitals besides coordinating with hospitals run through ESI, municipal corporations and reputed private hospitals. “This is a welcome step,” said Dr  , director general, medical education, UP. 
 
 As per rules, two DNB seats may be given to a hospital with 100 beds. All the 75 district hospitals in UP have more than a 100 beds. Some have more than 400 beds which will allow them a higher intake. 
 
 “Conservatively, we can look forward to 200 DNB PG seats and 50 superspeciality seats,” Tripathi said, adding that there are 650 PG medical seats in UP as of now. “The increment would be more than 35%,” he said. 
 
 Though nominal, the increment can help in strengthening public sector health facilities in the long run. This may be guessed from the fact that community health centers face an acute shortage of specialists. As per the National Health Statistics Report 2015, CHCs in UP have an average 85% shortfall of surgeons, gynaecologists, pediatricians and radiographers. 
 
 “There have been occasions where we could not get teachers in the normal process of recruitment, hence the incentive,” DG ME said admitting that medical institutions in state face 10 to 30% shortfall in faculty positions.
