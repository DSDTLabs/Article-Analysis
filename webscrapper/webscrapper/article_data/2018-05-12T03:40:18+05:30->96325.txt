MUMBAI: The mayor’s new   might come up at either Shivaji Park or  , going by new reservations proposed in the Development Plan (DP) 2014-34.

 The new reservations proposed for the two large plots in Shivaji Park and Worli are part of what is called the “excluded plan”, or that part of the DP that saw major changes and could not be notified on Thursday as it will first have to go through a process of suggestions and objections.
 
 The new reservations proposed for the two plots ask for these to be marked for municipal housing, and BMC officials hinted that the mayor’s bungalow might be constructed on one of these.
 
 The mayor’s residence today is in the Shivaji Park neighbourhood in  , but that property is now to be converted into a memorial for Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray. 
 
 To build a new mayoral residence, the BMC had proposed a reservation under the head “municipal housing” for two plots, said an official. 
 
 One of the plots in the zone of consideration is today a public municipal gymkhana at Shivaji Park which officers claimed was not being used fully. On the other plot in Worli, the BMC had not very long ago proposed to construct a municipal officers gymkhana. 
 
 “We had sent the proposal for a gymkhana for municipal officers at Worli, which did not pass,” the official said. “As there is no such reservation as ‘mayor bungalow’, the same would need to be constructed on a ‘municipal housing’ plot .”
 
 The Worli proposal for gymkhana had been opposed by parties saying the taxpayers would not benefit from it. Another controversy about it was that the space was marked as an open space in the DP of 1991. “The government has now proposed changing it to ‘municipal housing’,” the official said.
 
 If the bungalow comes up at the public municipal gymkhana in Shivaji Park, it would have to be 50% smaller than the official residence, which covers 11,551 sq m. The Worli plot is larger at 12,000 sq m.
