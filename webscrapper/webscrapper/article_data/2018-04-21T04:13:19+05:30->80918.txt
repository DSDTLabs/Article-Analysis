AHMEDNAGAR:   (25) was relaxing at home when his cellphone rang on April 7. The next 38 seconds, when his father   Kotkar spoke breathlessly, were shattering for the youngster.

 The father told him he had been shot at. “I will not survive, you come fast. They are chasing   ( ) with a dagger, a sword and a revolver. You come soon and save him,” he said.
 
  superintendent of police   said, “Sanjay called his son Sangram and told him that three MLAs and others were behind the attack.”
 
 But before Sangram could ask his father about his whereabouts, the call got disconnected. Minutes later, his friends told him something had happened in the   area. When he reached the spot, his father lay motionless in a pool of blood.
 
 Sanjay, the only son of a retired policeman, had been a lifelong   worker. He and Thube died after being shot and stabbed on April 7.
 
 Sangram works as a recovery executive with a private finance company. On April 7, he was at home at 5.15pm when the phone rang.
 
 What shocked Sangram the most, the Ahmednagar police said, was the fact that the person who fired the shots at his father was Sandeep Gunjal, one of his seniors from college.   was also a neighbour, with his residence barely 200 metres away from the Kotkar’s house on Nepti Road. “I could never have imagined that the person we had known for so many years would murder my father. We were not close to Gunjal, but we had cordial ties. We would greet each other when we passed by,” Sangram said.
