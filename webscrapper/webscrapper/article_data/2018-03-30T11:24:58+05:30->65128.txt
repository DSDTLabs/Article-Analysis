BHUBANESWAR: Hundreds of job aspirants staged a demonstration near the state assembly on Thursday demanding increase in the upper age limit for state government jobs. They want the government to increase it from 32 to 42 years for the benefit of unemployed youths in the state. 

 The youths, under the aegis of Asayi Chatra Chatri Parishad (aspirant students council), staged protest at the lower PMG. Odisha has more than 10 lakh unemployed youths.
 
 Girija Sankar Jena, convener of the Parishad, said the state government does not come up with jobs every year. "The government also delays the recruitment process by one to three years. We spend time waiting for government jobs. After demonetization, several private companies have stopped hiring. It has added to our woes," said the 30-year-old Jena. An MCom, he is trying for an accountant's job in state PSUs. 
 
 Jena said states like Goa and   have set the upper age limit at 45 and 44 years, respectively. Similarly, Uttarakhand and   have increased it to 42 years. States like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Tripura, West Bengal and   have set their age limit at 40. 
 
 A job aspirant,  , said the state selection board (SSB) has set the upper age limit for appointment of college teachers at 42. "If it can do for the post of lecturer, why can't the state implement it in other government jobs," Behera wondered. 
 
 "The state government has increased the retirement age from 58 to 60 years. It stops us for two more years to get into any government jobs. So the state government should increase the upper age limit for new appointments," he added.
 
 A youth delegation met a senior official at the chief minister's office and discussed their problems. The officer said the government would examine the demand and the practices being followed by other states.
