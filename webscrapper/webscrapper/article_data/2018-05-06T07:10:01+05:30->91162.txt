AHMEDABAD:The unforgiving summer is not only taking its toll on the people of Ahmedabad, but also on stray animals, which normally adapt to weather changes. In Paldi on Friday, a baby   fell off a tree and was found in a semi-conscious state. Some Good Samaritans took the monkey to the animal hospital in  .

 “When the monkey was brought in, we examined it and noticed the symptoms of severe dehydration,” said Dr Balbhadra Chavda, the veterinary officer at the hospital. “We immediately administered saline and glucose drips. We kept him under observation till the next day. By Saturday morning, the little one started showing signs of recovery.”
 
 When the monkey began to play, the doctors determined that it was fine. “We dropped him at the locality from where he had been brought to our hospital,” Chavda said. 
 
 He said that while stray animals can adapt to weather changes, extreme temperatures are hard even for them to deal with. “As citizens, the least we can do is keep a bowl of water outside our homes or offices under shade,” Chavda said. “One can also create small sheds outside buildings for animals. We’ve been seeing all sorts of animals, including cats and dogs, suffering from  .”
 
 Meanwhile, the city continued to bake at 42.3°C which was 1.1 degrees above normal while the night temperature was 27.8°C, which was 1.8 degrees above normal.
