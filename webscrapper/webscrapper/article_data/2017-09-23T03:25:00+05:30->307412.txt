Bicholim: Internal disputes between the ruling council in   municipality and MLA Pramod Sawant has created a bitter situation and is hindering development.

 Sakhali municipal council (SMC) chairperson Dharmesh Saglani said that for the last four years, the municipality did not get any government funds for development.
 
 On the other hand, Sawant, who is also assembly speaker, said that the ruling council is only interested in playing politics and has deliberately withheld occupancy certificates of development projects. 
 
 “The new building for the SMC was inaugurated around nine months ago, but the administration has not yet shifted ,” said Sawant.
 
 Asked about this, Saglani said that the SMC wants the government help to shift to the new building.
 
 Sawant also alleges that occupancy certificates for Ravindra Bhavan, government college, community health centre and the new SMC building has not been issued by the municipality, even though engineers and consultants from the Goa state infrastructure development corporation (GSIDC) were constantly following up on these matters. 
 
 “I feel that SMC is purposely delaying this process. They do not want projects inaugurated by BJP to be utilized by people. SMC would have got funds in lakhs of rupees from GSIDC if proper follow up was done,” said the Sakhali MLA.
 
 Saglani said that the process of issuing occupancy certificates is in progress.
