Ahmedabad: Senior police officers who had gathered in Sardarnagar for a reform programme on the occasion of Women’s Day were shocked and embarrassed when after the event, some women got up and said, “Ame to daru no vyavsay j karishun (We will continue in the liquor business).”

 Fear that the situation would spiral out of control, senior police officers including additional commissioner of police, Sector 2, Ashok Yadav, left without speaking to waiting mediapersons.
 
 Yadav, during his speech, urged the women to stay away from the illegal liquor trade at Chharanagar in Sardarnagar, saying that liquor has destroyed many families.
 
 Yadav warned that police would make every effort to throttle the liquor trade in the area and would take stern action against those involved in brewing or trafficking liquor. “Yadav urged the audience to inform police if someone brews liquor in their area,” said a senior police official.
 
 Just as Yadav finished his speech, a few women at the gathering stood up and shouted that they would continue to sell liquor. The embarrassed cops had to quickly leave the venue.
 
 Senior police officials said just one or two women shouted out the words, but the rest of the audience supported them. “They later told us later that there are a few among us who do not want to live a honest life and create trouble for others. We are going to take stern action against those who continue to sell liquor,” added a senior police official.
