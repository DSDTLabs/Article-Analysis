Nagpur: The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), and Super Specialty Hospital (SSH) will soon be setting up Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP) and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) to minimize pollution caused due to bio-medical waste.

 The two projects will be implemented with help from the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). The ETP plant will deal with all the blood and liquid waste that is generated from the eight operation theatres in GMCH and four in SSH.
 
 “Neeri is an expert in ETP development, and hence GMCH is taking help from the institute in setting up the ETP at both hospitals. All the liquid waste generated from the hospitals will also be released in the drains only after treating it as per Neeri guidelines. Neeri would be spending Rs5 lakh on the project,” said Dr Abhimanyu Niswade, the GMCH dean.
 
 State minister for medical education Ravindra Chavan had visited GMCH as well as Indira Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) to assess the disposal of   in the two college hospitals on the directives of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who has been keenly following the issue. Hence, GMCH administration has taken up the job of pollution management very seriously.
 
 There is a system for biomedical waste disposal, like body parts and tissues removed during surgery. But there is no system to deal with liquid waste, which generates a lot of microbial activity in sewage and causes smell all around. The ETP plant will help manage bacterial activity and prevent the foul odour.
