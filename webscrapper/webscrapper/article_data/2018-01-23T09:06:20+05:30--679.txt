HYDERABAD: Pawan Kalyan’s   tour has annoyed the BJP, which on Monday described the   as an ‘under construction project’ and ‘B team’ of the TRS. BJP spokesman Krishnasagar Rao’s said this on a day that Pawan began his tour of Telangana.

 The BJP’s reaction has come as a surprise as Pawan has been on good terms with the party. During the 2014 elections, he campaigned for the BJP and TDP and declared his support for Narendra Modi.
 
 With the BJP hoping to improve its tally in Telangana in 2019, Pawan’s tour has not gone down well with the party. Krishnasagar Rao alleged that CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, who did not allow any leader or party to reach out to the masses, allowed Pawan’s yatra and this hints at a possible deal between them.
 
 “People of Telangana do not suffer from memory loss and understand that   was against the formation of Telangana,” he said. “His package politics in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana will be rejected by the people.   is bereft of ideology, leaders, cadre and sincerity,” he said.
