AMARAVATI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu   on Monday paid tributes to Hindutva leader   on the occasion of his death anniversary, but beat a hasty retreat immediately thereafter by deleting the tweet he had posted from his official Twitter handle. 

  "Humble tributes to the revolutionary freedom fighter, Veer   on his death anniversary," tweeted Naidu at 9.43 am on Monday. But minutes later, the tweet was deleted.
 
 Sources in chief minister’s office refused to state the reason as to why the tweet was deleted, but party insiders claimed Naidu’s sudden change of mind was due to strained relations between TDP and BJP, Naidu did not want to be identified too closely with the RSS idealogue, who is said to have coined the word ‘Hindutva.’
