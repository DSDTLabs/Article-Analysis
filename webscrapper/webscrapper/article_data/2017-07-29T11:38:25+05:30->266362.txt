TRICHY: VCK president   has alleged that the murder of Kathiresan, a 22-year-old   youth from Thiruppaingeeli in Trichy, was the outcome of caste atrocity against dalits, here on Friday. He also sought a CBI probe into murder of dalit youths. 

 Referring to the murder of G Kathir alias Kathiresan of Thirppaingeeli village in Trichy on July 8,   said, “The gang dragged him from his house and beat him to death. They claimed that they killed him for damaging the water pipelines in a farm. If their allegations were true, they should have complained to the police. But it is not fair to kill him.”
 
 Thirumavalavan was in the city to participate in the protest to condemn the murder of Kathir. V Thangarasu, 57, and his sons Suresh, 37 and T Baskar, 30 and a gang beat him to death after dragging him out of his house in front of his live-in partner. The woman belonged to an upper caste in the same village. 
 
 The VCK president linked the murder of Kathiresan to atrocities against dalits. “In the last six months, around 40 dalits were killed. Our party has a strong suspicion that the politics over caste was the reason for the murders.   is on the top of the list on atrocities against dalits in the country,” said Thirumavalavan, while demanding a CBI probe into the murders of dalit youths
 
 Without directly naming, he took strong exception to a party for politicising the death of dalit youths to gain political mileage. “A political party whose vote bank declined to one percent to five percent and had no way to ally with either DMK or AIADMK is instigating the attack on dalits for their own benefit,” he said. 
 
 It may be recalled that the National commission for schedule castes (Tamil Nadu and Puduchery) alleged that caste atrocity was behind the murder of Kathiresan on July 14.
