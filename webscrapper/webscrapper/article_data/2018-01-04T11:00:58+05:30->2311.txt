MANGALURU: Hours after the Pilikula water amusement park incident, where two girls and two boys were thrashed by members of saffron outfits on Tuesday, a Facebook page ‘Veera Kesari’ has justified the act.

 The post, which has gone viral on social media, says physical assault is the last resort to stop   which results in ‘love jihad’. “The recent developments in society are paving way for destruction of religious and cultural values. Such incidents could have avoided, if we (Hindus) had   in place,” it says. 
 
 Further, it warns girls in and around Moodbidri against roaming with youths of other religions. “You may have hundred reasons to roam with the boys of opposite religion, but we don’t need those explanations. We’ve advised you enough,” it states. According to the post, the youths at a prominent college in Moodbidri will keep an eye on such activities.
 
 “We’ve learnt that many girls who go to far-off places on tours are roaming with Muslim boys. Giving excuses of photo-shoot, some of them are going out with boys. In the coming days if we find girls roaming with boys of other religion, we’ll beat up the girls more than the boys,’’ the post warns. It adds that it’s not just a social media post but enough preparations have been made to implement the plan.
 
 
 
 
 Police have arrested three more persons —Varadaraj, 32, Dinesh, 26, and Abhishek, 21, all from Moodushedde—in connection with the Pilikula incident. 
 
 Police said Sampath Shetty, 25, who assaulted the girls and boys, was earlier booked two times for rioting and gambling.
