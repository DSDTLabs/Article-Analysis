KOLHAPUR: The traders association on Tuesday threatened to launch an indefinite strike if the   (KMC) fails to withdraw the notice on local body tax (LBT) dues by February 14. The civic body has issued notices to recover   pending since 2011.

 While abolishing the LBT in August 2015, the state government has directed the civic bodies to assess the LBT paid during the implementation period of 2011-15 and recover the difference from the traders. Consequently, the KMC begun their assessment work for 2011 with the help a panel of six chartered accountants. After the assessment, the civic body has issued notices to 20,000 traders, stating that during the assessment period they had quoted tax as per the octroi rates, which existed before the LBT came into existence. The KMC gave the traders time till March end to pay the dues. 
 
 Sadanand Korgaonkar, president of the  , said, “Traders from places such as Kolhapur, Solapur, Thane, Sangli, Mumbai and Parbhani are being harassed by the civic bodies. Traders in Sangli have already boycotted the assessment work. The KMC is sending the same notice again and again. The tax imposed by civic body is illegal. We are planning to go on an indefinite strike from February 15 if the issue is not resolved.”
 
 He added, “The representatives of traders have decided to meet chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to put forward their demands for cancelling the assessment. The traders from Parbhani district have observed a day strike claiming that their LBT dues have been calculated both on buying as well as selling of goods. As per rules, LBT is self-assessed by the traders. Traders faces huge losses during the initial period of LBT implementation. The amounts calculated by the civic bodies are exorbitant and do not match with self-assessment.”
