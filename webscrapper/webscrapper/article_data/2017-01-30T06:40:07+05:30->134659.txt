AUSGRAM/BHANGAR: An   prevailed in   with   out in numbers on Sunday to ensure there was no repeat of the   that singed the area a day before.

 Men and women in uniform far outnumbered ordinary folks as streets remained deserted with shops keeping their shutters down and buses plying with hardly any passengers. Apprehensive of a possible police crackdown to nab those who had ransacked the local police station on Saturday , male members have gone into hiding, leaving behind only women, children and the aged.
 
 Burdwan SP Kunal Agarwal said 12 persons had so far been arrested, including Guskara municipality Ward 8 councillor Chanchal Garai and CPM zonal committee secretary Suren Hembram.
 
 Locals said the violence was a reaction to resentment that had been brewing against the officer-in-charge for allowing the civic police to wield batons and beat up students. They also alleged the cops and local   leaders have been hand-inglove in promoting illegal construction. Reacting to images of policemen in tears after Saturday's attack, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said people have lost respect and faith on men in uniform. “The ruling party is to blame for this,“ he added.
 
 Inspector-in-charge of Ausgram police station was summarily removed and temporary charge handed over to circle inspector Krishnendu Ghosh Dastidar. The gate to the police station is being kept locked to prevent a repeat of Saturday's embarrassing attack.
 
 In Bhangar, the apparent calm was ruffled by visits of two heavyweights.While Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury asked villagers to carry on their movement against the project without getting into “armed struggle“, Imam of Furfura Sharif, Toha Siddiqui, praised chief minister  's intentions and blamed minister Sovan Chatterjee for “pushing“ the project. Trinamool MLA Rezzak Mollah said peace was back in the area.
