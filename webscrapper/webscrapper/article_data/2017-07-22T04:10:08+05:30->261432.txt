KOLKATA: The CID cyber cell has arrested an engineering student from   for allegedly hacking into his girlfriend's mobile and uploading her nude photographs on a porn site. 

 The arrest, carried out in coordination with the   police, has led officers to believe the youth,   (22), was involved in similar incidents with other girls even earlier. "The arrested accused is a resident of Panskura. He accessed the girl's naked photos and tried to blackmail her into going on a trip with him. But when she repeatedly rebuffed his advances, he threatened to upload the photos online. Recently, he acted on the threat and uploaded a few of her nude videos on a porn website, and even mentioned the girl and her father's names there. The police have seized his laptop and mobile that were used to commit the crime," said DIG (operations) Nishat Pervez. Bakshi even reportedly tried to extort money from the girl over the past two months.
 
 CID officers said he had been booked under different sections of the IPC and IT Act. Pointing out that revenge had become the commonest motive for such cyber crimes, a top IPS officer said, "We've seen a double-fold rise in such FIRs in two years."
