NEW DELHI:   said on Thurs day that he will “resign“ if he is asked to proceed on leave and maintained that the HRD ministry had not told him to do so.

 The ministry has, meanwhile, initiated a routine process to shortlist the successor of Tripathi, who is at the centre of the controversy over handling of the recent violence in the   (BHU) campus. His tenure ends on November 30. “So far, nothing of this sort has been communicated to me. I have been in touch with the HRD minister (Prakash Javadekar) right from the day of the incident and have briefed him about the situation as well as the measures taken. But if am I asked to go on leave, I will resign,“ Tripathi said.
 
 The VC said that he has contributed a lot to improve the functioning of the university. “Having done so much, it will be insulting to go on leave two months before my tenure comes to end. I will prefer quitting,“ he asserted. Ministry officials said the process for appointing his successor has been initiated, but maintained the timing of violence in the BHU campus and steps for appointment of a new VC is completely “coincidental“. Even if the unrest would not have happened, appointment process would have been initiated, a senior HRD official said.
