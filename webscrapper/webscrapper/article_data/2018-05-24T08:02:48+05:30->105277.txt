LUCKNOW: Most people around   see him as cute and chubby child. But the toddler from Azamgarh is in deep pain due to nephrosis, a renal ailment that affects more than 10 lakh people in India. What gives Rishu the chubby look is in fact the swelling caused by it.

 
 “He rarely smiles or plays like children of his age,” says Rishu’s grandfather  , waiting for their turn in nephrology OPD at SGPGI, where fortunately, doctors have found a way to help Rishu.
 
  
  
 
 “The boy’s is a classic case of steroid-resistance that makes treatment of children with nephrosis difficult. The human body has natural defence against outside substances, including medicines like steroids,” said Prof  , professor of nephrology at SGPGI.
 
 “When the body comes in contact with a foreign substance, a protein called Pgp (p-gylcoprotein) is released. This protein on the body cell surface works like an efflux pump. It bloats to prevent penetration of medicine inside. The medicine doesn’t work and the symptoms show up. The puffiness goes up further as medicine doesn’t act,” said  .
 
 “One of every five kids with nephrosis is resistant to steroids from the beginning. Half of the remaining develop resistance in the course of treatment,” he said.
 
 Intrigued with commonality of resistance in nephrotic kids, the immunology and nephrology departments began a study to look into the reasons. “We found that genetic reasons were responsible for resistance in one third cases,” said Prof Prasad.
 
 Once the problem was identified, the search for solutions began.
 
 “We started trying certain enzyme inhibitors (molecules that bind to an enzyme and decrease its activity) to treat children and noted a 50-70% drop in resistance,” he explained, adding that the finding will also help patients who develop resistance after transplant or in cancer.
