Tollywood superstars, a packed audience, music, drama, controversy — it was all there at the pre-release event of superstar Mahesh Babu’s upcoming film Bharat Ane Nenu. The event, titled ‘Bharat Bahiranga Sabha’ took place at the LB Stadium in Hyderabad on Saturday and witnessed a large crowd as people from across the Telugu states travelled to catch a glimpse of their favourite star. And what made the event more thrilling was that two of Tollywood’s biggest superstars —   and   — attended the event, with the latter as the chief guest. It was also attended by  , who’s making her Tollywood debut with BAN along with the cast and crew of the film. 

  
 
 “I am thrilled to see Tarak here. I had attended the audio launch of his film Aadi many years ago. I feel that by attending each other’s events, we can create a new trend and a sense of camaraderie among top heroes in Tollywood,” Mahesh Babu said. 
 
  
 
 The actor, who’s collaborating with director   for the second time after Srimanthudu in 2015, says that he was initially a bit sceptical about playing the role of a CM. 
 “When Siva told me about the script initially, I was a little scared. Because in real life, I have absolutely no connection to politics, and playing the role of a CM was a bit daunting. But after listening to the story, I felt inspired. I also learnt a lot while shooting for this film and I think this is my finest performance ever,” Mahesh Babu added. 
 
  
 Heaping praises on ‘Mahesh Anna’, NTR Jr stated that he has been an inspiration to all other heroes. “He is the first person who has experimented with his roles, despite being a commercial hero. In fact, after watching him we have all decided to experiment too. I truly wish Bharat Ane Nenu to be a landmark film in his career,” he said. 
 The crowd, however, got a bit out-of-control at times and even injured a sub-inspector, who tried to control the crowd.
