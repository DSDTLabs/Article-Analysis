NEW DELHI: ASK   (ASK PIA), the real estate private equity arm of the  , has raised Rs 535 crore as part of its plans to create a Rs 1,000-crore fund.

 But for now, it has to close the fund-raise as fund managers feel that this is a sufficient amount and will take around six months to deploy.
 
 Once a substantial chunk of the Rs 535 crore is deployed, they will open the fund again to complete the targeted amount. The latest fundraising comes against the backdrop of a sluggish real estate market.
 
 Amit Bhagat, MD & CEO,   Property Investment Advisors, said the objective of this fund is to provide flexible and patient capital. He added that the fund will give money to those projects that are facing a cash crunch but are bankable. The fund will help expedite the construction and completion of projects.
 
 Keeping in mind the current requirement of developers, structured/preferred equity investments are planned to be provided through this fund, he said. The group is currently managing over Rs 4,500 crore. The fund will be focusing on investing in mid segment and affordable residential projects and generating sustainable risk adjusted returns, Bhagat said.
 
 Sunil Rohokale, MD & CEO, ASK Group, said ASK PIA is partnering with trusted developers, which has resulted in successful exits worth Rs 2,000 crore.
