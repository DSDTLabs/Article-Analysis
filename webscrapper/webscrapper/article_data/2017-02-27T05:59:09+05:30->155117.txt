Exams are part and parcel of a student's life. Since they cannot be avoided, students have to prepare themselves to face them with confidence and come out as winners. 

 It is human nature to feel pressure before any exam but boards make students even more nervous. If not taken care of, the pressure becomes anxiety which can lead to depression.
 
 Stress is caused by several factors. If any part of the study material is left uncovered, feeling anxious is quite natural. Last-minute preparation is another factor that increases anxiety during exams. Then there is the unfortunate tendency of some parents to fulfil their dreams through their children. In this process, they fail to realize that they are exerting undue pressure on young minds.
 
 Parents can play a very important role in calming students and helping them retain focus. They can provide a supportive and loving atmosphere at home, have faith in themselves and their child.
 
 In this crucial hour, parents must encourage their children to consult teachers in case of doubts and difficulties. Children should get over their hesitation and develop a healthy rapport with teachers. Encouraging them to take a break after a study session is effective. Parents must sit down their children and ask them if they are feeling confident or need any help. They should avoid comparing performances as it will develop a feeling of inadequacy.
 
 Most importantly, examinees need a balanced diet and physical activity. Parents should remind their children of their boundless love and support without any reference to the outcome of the exams. Parental support and practical guidance can definitely reduce students' stress.
