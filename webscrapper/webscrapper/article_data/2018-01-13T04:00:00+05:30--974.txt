Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) plans to build a Shahid Smarak at an estimated cost of Rs 50 crore on 88,000 square metre of land in Vesu-Rundh-Magdalla area of the city. Construction would only be on 7 per cent area at Shahid Smarak, which seeks to commemorate the Indian armed forces, martyrs and freedom fighters of the country. The project is expected to be completed within 24 months time.  The smarak would display arms and ammunition besides models of aircraft, missiles, submarines, tanks, aircraft carriers of the Indian armed forces. It would also have an obelisk for martyrs and galleries dedicated to personalities of Indian Army, winners of gallantry awards, important battles in Indian history etc.  There is also plan to have a peace centre and a yoga centre at Shahid Smarak, which will sensitize people about the role Indian armed forces play to keep the country united from threats posed by inimical forces. Angan Architects, which has been appointed consultant for the project, recently made a presentation before the standing committee of SMC.
