Marvel Studios producer   believes that the upcoming superhero film   doesn't rely on current plot points in the   (MCU) and therefore can be passed off as a standalone project.

 
  
 Moore, who has earlier worked on 'Captain America: The Winter Solider' and 'Captain America: Civil War', has teamed up with filmmaker   for the upcoming 'Black Panther' movie.
 
 Reportedly, despite the character appearing in 'Civil War', Moore said the film can be seen as just a "stand alone" movie.
 
 Moore said that 'Black Panther' is inherently linked because of 'Civil War' connections and because of the Ultron connections with Klaue. So there are strings that we are playing with. But again, much like 'Doctor Strange', we felt this had enough storytelling that it could stand alone beyond those things."
 
 "We wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn't relying on other things that were happening in the MCU. Now that doesn't mean what happens in the film won't have ripples in the MCU but the film itself isn't relying on other plot points in the MCU," he added. 
 
 The movie is based on the first ever black superhero in mainstream American comics who was created by Marvel
  Comics writer   and the equally iconic artist-and-writer Jack Kirby and first appeared in 'Fantastic Four #52' in 1966.
 
 The motion picture is expected to expand on the storyline that was first introduced in 'Civil War' of how T'Challa - played by   - becomes the superhero.
 
 T'Challa's father T'Chaka is king of the African nation   and has the ceremonial title Black Panther as the chief of the panther tribe, but is killed when a bomb goes off at the UN making his son the Black Panther.
 
 The film stars  , Letitia Wright, Forest Whitaker, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman and  .
