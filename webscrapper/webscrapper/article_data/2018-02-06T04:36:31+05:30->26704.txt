GURUGRAM: Around 10,000 residents of sectors 3, 5 and 6 have complained they are reeling from   because of technical snags in the motors of  . The residents claimed once supply was snapped , it remained deficient for the next four days because of the civic body’s alleged apathy.

 “We have four high-powered motors for this area — two 60HP, one 45HP and one 35HP,” said Dinesh  , the RWA president of the affected sectors. “Of these, only one motor with 60HP was working properly. The one with 35HP is unable to draw with the optimum pressure and the other two are dysfunctional. The lone motor that was working earlier has now become prone to technical snags. Its panels are wearing out. We have been apprising the MCG officials to fix all the motors, but nothing is happening. These pumps are operated by the MCG,” added Vashishta. 
 
 Vashishta said those living at the tail-end of the sectors and do not have motor pumps of their own were the worst affected. “Not everyone in the area has a motor pump,” said Vashishta. “When the supply resumes, the water first gets into the pipelines of those who suck it with motors. So, hardly any water is left for those who do not have pumps. Another issue that compounds the problem is the irregular placement of pipes in the common water tanks. Our tank has a capacity of 10 lakh litres, but motor pumps are capable of drawing only 7 lakh litres before the supply runs out. That is because we have such a system in place that 3 lakh litres of water stays at the bottom of the tank and the motor is unable to reach it. We want MCG officials to fix this problem as well,” he added.
 
 The residents said they got the water from the Chandu Budhera treatment plant in Basai. “We get no information in case of a leakage in the pipeline,” said  , another resident.
 
 This paper called up  , junior engineer at the MCG, but he did not take the calls. However, another MCG official said one of the high-powered motors had been taken up for repairs.
