CHENNAI: To help promote educational and professional opportunities for the third gender, a city-based NGO is organizing the second edition of beauty pageant ‘Mx. Trans   Awards, in which thirteen transgender community members from the state will be participating.

 The concept was inspired by the decision of the   and the   in   to award certificates to students with the gender-neutral title ‘Mx.’, instead of using Mr or Ms, titles. The pageant, aimed at giving a stage for showcasing talent and intellect coupled with a fashion show will be held on October 7.
  
 Held once every two years, the awards function is aimed at bringing people from different walks of life and exposing them to the talent from the transexual community while sensitizing the former to problems faced by them and opening up more avenues in their education and professional lives.
  
 The winners of the first edition of the event that was held back in 2015 went on to pursue their higher education in fashion design. “The winner and the runners-up would be exposed opportunities to pursue their academic interests, most of which are in fashion design, cosmetology, and baking,” said   Sarathy, chief operations officer at Born to Win social trust that is organizing the pageant.
  
 As part of the award function, ‘Thirunangaigalin Thirai Kavyam,’ a montage of transexual people in the acting industry would also be exhibited. It will essay the contrasting ways transexual people are portrayed in films – some in demeaning roles while some movies project them in uplifting roles. “The aim is to get people to accept transexual people in the same light as they perceive others. There are acceptability issues and mentalities need to be changed,” Divya added.
