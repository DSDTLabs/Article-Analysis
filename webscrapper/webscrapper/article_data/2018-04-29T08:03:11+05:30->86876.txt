NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: In a dramatic turn of events, Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) member  , a former India women’s team captain, has turned down the Indian cricket board’s ( ) offer to honour her with the lifetime achievement award for women.

 
 
 
 Her refusal came late in the night after the BCCI had already made the list of recipients public. Edulji was set to receive the award ahead of her once-teammates Shubhangi Kulkarni and Sudha Shah. Following Edulji’s refusal, Sudha will be the new recipient of the award for the 2017-18 season, it was decided late on Saturday evening. On the men’s side, Pankaj Roy will be posthumously awarded the CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award for 2016-17, while   will be awarded for 2017-18.
 
 
 
 Edulji was part of the panel last year which picked   as the first woman cricketer to get a special lifetime award. It is learnt that Edulji had recused herself from the panel this year since her name was in contention. 
 
  
  
 “Neither me nor any other member of the CoA was part of this awards committee. I do not think it is appropriate for me to accept this honour at this juncture,” Edulji clarified in a statement.
 
 TOI has learnt that the decision to award Edulji was a bit rushed because of the growing tension between BCCI members and the CoA. Sources said there was “apprehension” that Edulji could miss out on such accolades once the BCCI elections happen and a new regime takes over. Now, however, Edulji has refused to accept the award at this stage.
