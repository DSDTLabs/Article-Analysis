HOWRAH: Irrigation minister   and Howrah's mayor Rathin Chakraborty visited ward number one at   area under   following reports that river Hooghly has eroded away about 800m space along the bank and has entered Badhaghat. 

 Around 150 houses have already been damaged as the river bank is witnessing erosion for the last six years. Among the houses damaged there are some mutli-storied buildings as well. Banerjee said that Rs 3.26 crore would be sanctioned to check the erosion. "Work in the area will start by February. Concrete dam will be built," the minister said. He said this will help stop the approaching river that's engulfing houses on JN Mukherjee Road.
