 At  , she dedicated her performance to her close friend and actress, who was recently attacked by a group of goons, in Kochi.
 
 Prior to the performance Manju said, “I am thinking of one person while I am standing here. It is none other than my friend who bravely picked up herself and is now back to work battling the wounds inflicted on her. She sets an example by showing that the spirit won’t fade away even when wounded brutally. I dedicate my performance to her. And also to the womanhood who fought with courage against the evils in their life”.
 
 The recital held in the capital city was in association with the Swadeshbhimani Kesari award function organised by the State government.
