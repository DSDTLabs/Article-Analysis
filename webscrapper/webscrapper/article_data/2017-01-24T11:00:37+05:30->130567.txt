 This is part of the district administration's 'Swachh Survekshan' initiative to keep the city clean, said additional deputy commissioner Khitish Pegu, whom petrol pump dealers met recently. "We have asked petrol pump dealers to clean their pumps and the adjacent areas. We want these petrol pumps to be role models for others as far as cleanliness is concerned. Without public support, the district administration cannot keep the city clean," Pegu was quoted as saying in a statement. 
 
 The administration also asked pump owners to set up toilets with separate signboards for both men and women.
 
 Deputy commissioner M Angamuthu said petrol pumps have so far adhered to the norms, but the administration will assess the situation and decide on the following course of action. Addressing the problems associated with cashless transaction at petrol pumps, additional deputy commissioner Nabadip Pathak said the administration will ask banks to provide Point of Sale (PoS) facilities at all pumps in the metro area.
