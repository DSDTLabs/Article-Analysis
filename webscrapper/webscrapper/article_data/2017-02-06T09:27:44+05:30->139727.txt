 “I have come to Surat for the first time and can’t go without offering a gift to Surtis. Indian Railways will run high-end Tejas train between Surat and Mumbai. Operating at speeds above 130 kmph, it will offer on-board services such as entertainment, local cuisine, Wi-Fi, etc. through a single service provider to ensure accountability and improved customer satisfaction," Prabhu said at Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) here.

 “Gujarat has been the most neglected state when it comes to budgetary allocation of the Indian Railways. From 2009-2014, Gujarat received only Rs 588 crore for capital expenditure. In our regime, the allocation in 2015-16 was increased to Rs 2,467 crore, which was 319 per cent higher than previous eight years. This time around, the expenditure in Gujarat has been pegged at Rs 13,025 crore,” said Prabhu.
