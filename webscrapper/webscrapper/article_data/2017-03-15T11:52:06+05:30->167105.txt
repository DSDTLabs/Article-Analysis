VELLORE: The   police on Wednesday arrested two people in connection with a   in an illegal   manufacturing unit at Adiyathur in   district of Tamil Nadu on Tuesday which claimed the lives of two workers.

 Two workers – C Gandhi, 30, and C Ponnurangam, 42, of the same village – were killed in the blast in the illegal cracker making unit in a mangrove at Adiyathur.
 
 Police arrested P Tirupathi, 40, and V Raja, 35, of Adiyathur in connection with the blast. 
 
 The police registered a case against the duo under sections 304 (ii) and 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) of the Indian Penal Code read with 9 (B) (1) (b) the Explosives Act 1884.
 
 Inspector of Jolarpet police station S Rathina Sabapathi said Tirupathi and Raja were licensed cracker sellers.

 They engaged the two victims to make the crackers. 
 
 Forensic experts collected samples from the blast site. 
 
 “We are inquiring to trace the source of the explosive materials used for making the crackers and how long they have been doing this,” said Sabapathi.
 
 The police official added that the duo had been making the crackers illegally in the mangrove belonging to G Anandan, who lives in Bengaluru. “We will summon Anandan for inquiry in the coming days,” he added.
