This  's Day, the walls of the   commissioner's office turned into a canvas. Around 60 schoolgirls from a government school in Khandsa painted graffiti on the wall on the theme of women's safety and road safety, as part of a five-day project that started on Wednesday. 

  
 Sandeep Khirwar, the Gurgaon police commissioner, also joined the students and painted the logo of Haryana Police. Khirwar also interacted with the students, and asked them questions about the role of the police and informed them about the Mahila Police Thana. He also told the girls that they shouldnâ€™t be scared of the police.

  from Divnity Serves, the NGO whose artists helped the students paint the graffiti, told us, "It's a highly visible area. We conduct traffic awareness programmes and tell people about traffic rules, par log hamesha sunte nahin hain. But when you see something on a regular basis, you will remember it. And that is the purpose of this graffiti outside the police commissioner's office."
