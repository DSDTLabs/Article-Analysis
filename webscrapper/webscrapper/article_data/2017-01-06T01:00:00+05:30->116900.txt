On January 3, just three days after the horrific cases of molestation in Bengaluru, a DU professor was physically assaulted by a bag snatcher in  , in broad daylight. Radhika Menon, a professor in the Department of Education at Mata Sundri College for Women, was going to college in the morning when the incident happened at a Mayur Vihar, Phase III, petrol pump.

 “The incident happened in daylight. I had gone to refuel my car at the petrol pump in Mayur Vihar, Phase III, when a snatcher on a scooter came from the wrong side and dragged me along with my bag. When I pulled my bag back, he started threatening and abusing me. When I tried to uncover his face, he started to punch me on the head and slapped me. He called me a w**re and kept punching me while I was trying to pull him back. I was shouting the number of his scooty so that workers at the petrol pump might note it down, but they didn’t even come forward to help me let alone note down the number,” she says.
 
 She adds that when she asked bystanders and workers at the petrol pump why they didn’t help her, they said, ‘We thought that the person (attacker) was your husband.’ “I was completely shocked by their response. Even if I knew him, how could you let this happen to anyone? Anyone can attack you and nobody will come forward to help. Even if I knew him, does that make this acceptable?”
 
 Talking about womens’ safety, Menon points out, “How can women be safe? We don’t go out at night? This happened in broad daylight! We don’t wear short clothes? I was wearing a kurta and was carrying a shawl. With incidents like these, clothes are never responsible. While I was trying to pull him back, he called me a w**re. You’re called a w**re when you try to defend yourself, so where’s womens’ safety?”
 
 Menon has filed an FIR at the New Ashok Nagar Police Station, and a case of physical   has been registered. However, when we contacted police officials at the same station, they refused to comment on the issue.
