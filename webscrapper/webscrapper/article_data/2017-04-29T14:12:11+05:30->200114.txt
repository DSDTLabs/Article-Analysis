The box office collection of   starrer ‘Baahubali 2: The Conclusion’ is estimated to have crossed over Rs 100 crore, say latest reports. The movie broke the earlier record of ‘Kabali’, which managed to collect over Rs 45 crore. 

 It also made inroads into the Hindi heartland by collecting about Rs 38.52 crore on the first day itself, breaking the earlier record held by Salman Khan’s ‘Sultan,’ (Rs 36.54 crore). Collections are expected to go high in India this weekend, added industry analysts.
 
 Meanwhile, the movie is doing a good business in the overseas market. It had a gross collection of over $3 million in US on the first day. Now it is expected to collect up to $8 million in the weekend. Now, all eyes are on if the film will make history by becoming the first Indian movie to achieve Rs 1000 crore in box office.
