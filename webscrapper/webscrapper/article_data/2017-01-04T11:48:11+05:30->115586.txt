PANAJI: Appointments to around 35 new schoolteacher posts in government-aided institutions have been kept on hold as a result of the state’s issuance of a ban on new recruitments in November 2016. The salaries of another 40 teachers in aided schools would be delayed, as the state would not issue approval for their appointments.

 Following the government order, the directorate of education (DoE) decided not to provide no objection certificate (NOC) for the posts of 35 teachers, required by aided schools to appoint a new teacher. 
 
 The ban on new recruitments was issued by the state ‘to ensure smooth implementation’ of the benefits under 7th pay commission recommendations to existing government employees. The idea is to not create additional financial burden when the state is trying to hike the salaries and pensions of those who receive their salaries from the state. 
 
 As many as 40 new teachers, who were already recruited for aided schools, will have their salaries delayed as the DoE will not issue the necessary approval for their appointment just yet.
 
 The state’s November 2016 order states: “In case of government-aided educational institutions (including  ), the DoE, the directorate of higher education and the directorate of technical education shall first assess the request made by the institution concerned and thereafter recommend the case for obtaining specific approval of the department of personnel and concurrence of the finance department.”
 
 These orders are set to slow down teacher appointments to a great extent even when allowed with specific approvals. This recruitment ban applies to not just regular posts but even to those on contracts.
 
 The deficiency in supply of full-time teachers in Goa can be assessed by the fact that Goa still has 11.51% of its schoolteachers working on contractual basis, according to the data of the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry’s wing   (DISE).
