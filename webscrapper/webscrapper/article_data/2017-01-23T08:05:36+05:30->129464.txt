PANAJI: With the Tamil Nadu governor on Saturday passing an ordinance lifting the ban on   following protests from several sections of society supporting the bull-taming sport, I&B minister   on Sunday hinted that the ban on Goa’s traditional bull-fighting, dhirio, is open to be reconsidered.

 “We have not banned anything. The jallikattu ban was most stringent under Congress’s   as environment minister... If there are any demands, we will see the cultural background, consider the sentiments of locals and decide accordingly based on the wishes of the people,” Naidu said. tnn
 
 Since, in June 2015, when Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar’s statement about the Centre’s intention to lift the ban on ‘jallikattu’, a popular bull-taming sport in Tamil Nadu, hopes have been raised in Goa that the ban on dhirio may be relooked. Dhirio was banned for infliction of pain and suffering on bulls.
