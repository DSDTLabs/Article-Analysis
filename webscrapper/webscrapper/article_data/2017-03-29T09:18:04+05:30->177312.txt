PATNA: With   legislators trooping into the well of   on Tuesday   for contract workers and increase in grants for anganwadi workers, chairman of the House Awadhesh   adjourned the proceedings till 2.30pm.
 
  Leader of opposition in council   said over four lakh employees, who have been working on contract basis in different departments, are poorly paid. “A committee headed by chief secretary was formed last year to resolve the issue, but nothing has been done yet. This shows the laid back attitude of the government,” Modi said.
  
  The opposition members also demanded an increase in grants being given to anganwadi workers. “The Centre gives Rs 3,200 and the state Rs 750 per month to the anganwadi workers. We want the state government to give equal share to the sevikas,” Modi added.
  
  The opposition members also expressed anguish over the lathicharge on the anganwadi workers by male police personnel. “If a protest was organised by the females, what were male cops doing there?” he asked.
