New Delhi: Ever since Munawwar Hasan Rana and his family moved into their second-floor apartment in Bhagat Colony, Sant Nagar, Burari, a year ago, locals had a tough time. Brawls regularly happened in the neighbourhood because of goons loyal to Rana and Bunty, who openly flashed weapons. 

 Death threats came on the slightest pretext. A few days before Rana was killed, Bunty had threatened to shoot the building owner, Phool Singh, for locking the main gate at night, a neighbour said. On the night of May 19, many   heard several gunshots coming from Rana’s house. But nobody bothered to find out, fearing trouble from Rana and Bunty’s men. They are now horrified by the manner in which the strongman and his entire family was wiped out by his man Friday.
 
 Rana had forcibly taken the apartment from the building owner, Phool Singh, after defaulting on some payment. “We were told that he was contesting the UP elections and was an MLA earlier. Even after he was arrested in January, we were told that he was consolidating party activities,” Singh said. 
 
 But after April 22, after Rana’s family went missing, Bunty started visiting the house and spending hours there regularly. He claimed to have spare keys. But when Rana got out on parole, Bunty said he didn’t have the keys and broke open the lock.
