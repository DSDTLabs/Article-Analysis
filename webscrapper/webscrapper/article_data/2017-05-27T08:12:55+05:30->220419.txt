 While 1,048 cases of under-age driving were recorded within the   limits in 2014, the number stood at 1,636 in 2015 and 975 in 2016. In the first four months of this year, the Cyberabad traffic cops recorded only 40 cases of under-age driving.
 
 “We have taken up many campaigns on road safety and even visited schools and colleges in the Cyberabad region to counsel students on the perils of under-age driving. Perhaps this is why the number of cases of under-age driving has come down,” said A R Srinivas, DCP Traffic, Cyberabad.
 
 Road safety experts say that cops must also dole out stricter punishment to guardians who allow their children to drive on city roads without a license.
 
 “Even as the traffic police claim that the number of cases of under-age driving has come down, one can still witness it on the road on a daily basis. The only way to curb the number of under-age driving cases is to keep a tight vigil and ensure that stricter punishments are given to children and parents who engage in it. Children are even found driving to schools in their own vehicles these days. The fines presently in place are not a deterrent for violators,” said  , CEO of Indian Federation of Road Safety (IFROS).
 
 As per existing rules, driving a vehicle when under-age only involves a maximum penalty of Rs 500 for two, three, four and six wheelers.
