PANAJI: The traffic cell of Goa   has booked an average of 100 persons a day since its deployment of four laser speed radar guns (LSRG) on Tuesday to crack down on overspeeding motorists. 

 Director general of police (DGP)   told   on Saturday that over 500 overspeeding cases have been booked over the past few days. 
 
 The culpritsâ€™ licences have been compounded and the Goa police has recommended to the RTO that they be suspended. 
 
 Chander advised motorists to adhere to the speed limits in order to avoid this eventuality. 
 
 The cops said the LSRGs would be used across the state, especially at accident-prone zones, like the   and Zuari bridges. The DGP said that without proper speed limit signages, they would not use speed guns. LSRGs are capable of catching speeding vehicles 300m before they reach the equipment, by which time photo and video evidence would already be collected. 
 
 As the number of accidents have increased over the years, Goa police condicted a detailed study which revealed that overspeeding and drunken driving were the main causes of accidents and fatalities on Goan roads. Goa police also procured 100 alcometres, which were deployed on Saturday. The year 2017 saw over a thousand drunken driving cases booked. 
 
 In Goa, a person is killed in a road accident every 30 hours, due to rash and negligent driving either by the person killed or the driver of the opposite vehicle. This year, over 800 persons have been challaned for drunken driving to date.
