CHANDIGARH: Valentine’s Day holds a special meaning in the lives of many couples. Some prefer to hold hands and walk along Sukhna Lake. However, with   and Valentine’s Day falling on the same day this year, the city lovebirds were left disappointed. They complained of tight security, which made it difficult for them to spend some lone time.

 Most of the city roads, parks and popular hangout zones, which are usually crowded on Valentine’s Day, were seen devoid of the usual fervour and charm.
 
 The impact of Shivaratri celebrations, which was observed for two days this year, could be felt in places such as Geri Route (now Azaadi Route), Eiffel Tower road and Sukhna Lake. Most of these places wore a deserted look.
 
 Panjab University departments and off-campus colleges were also closed on the occasion of Shivaratri on Wednesday. Ankush Arora, a city-based restaurant owner, said, “Usually, the stretch from   turn till Sector 11 market and Sector 7,8 and 9 markets are completely packed with swanky cars and loud music. But this time, all of this is absent.”
 
 Priyanka Bansal, a citybased fashion designer, admits that the Valentine’s Day celebrations were ‘dull’ this year. “I think Shivaratri took the sheen off the V-day celebrations this time,” she said.
 
 Since most of the offices were closed on Wednesday on the occasion of Shivaratri, parks were mainly filled with family crowd, middle-aged couples and senior citizens.
 
 Moreover, stringent security checks were also put in place all over the city. More police officials were posted on Geri Route (Azaadi Route), near the Government College of Arts Road and near Sector 10-11 dividing road, thus making it difficult for the couples to spend some lone time in these places. “We have been asked to check and control any form of hooliganism happening in the city,” said Dalbir Singh, inspector, UT police. Over 800 police personnel were on duty on V-day.
