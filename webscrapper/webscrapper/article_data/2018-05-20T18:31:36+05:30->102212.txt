Gurgaon: A man was fined on Saturday for using drinking water to wash his car in Sector 15 (Part 1), in a rare crackdown by   officials to check wastage of potable water in the city.

 Civic officials claimed they caught the man during an inspection and issued a challan of Rs 500. The man, however, was taken aback and refused to accept the challan. The officials pasted the challan on his car and left. 
 
 “Wasting water is a punishable offence. Anyone found using potable water for washing cars or gardening will be liable to fine or punishment,” said MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav. The commissioner further said the MCG had constituted teams to check wastage of water and vowed regular inspections in commercial and residential areas in coming days. 
 
 In the day, civic officials also issued 100 more challans — 25 for burning waste, 30 for dumping construction and demolition waste and another 45 for dumping sewage waste in the open.
 
 In the wake of the ongoing strike by sanitation workers, the corporation has also formed 10 teams to carry out regular inspections in designated zones to check dumping of household garbage as well as construction debris in the open and prevent waste burning.
 
 “It might take us some time to address the problems of   and garbage littering, but I want to assure residents of action against people violating norms. Eventually, the issues will be addressed. I will also request the residents to reach out to us if they see any broken water pipeline or spot anyone wasting water in their areas,” said Yadav.
