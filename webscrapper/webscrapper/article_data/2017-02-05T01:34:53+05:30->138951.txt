NEW DELHI: The RSS-affiliated   ( ) has accused the   government of totally ignoring the “poor, lower middle class and unorganised sector of labourers who supported the government’s demonetisation move and took the worst hit from its consequences” in the   proposals and asked for a revision.

 In a letter addressed to Union finance minister   on Friday, BMS general secretary Virjesh Upadhyay asked the government to reconsider its budget proposal and make corrections to include provisions suggested through seven points by the largest trade union in the country. The letter says the budget has the interest of the middle class in mind, but the lower middle class and the lowest class have been ignored. “The government’s historic demonetisation decision got maximum support from the poor and the labourers while its ill-impact had to be borne mostly by the labourers in the unorganised sector, with more than 2.5 lakh unorganised industrial units shutting down and labourers working in them losing employment.
 
 Many sectors like real estate have been adversely impacted and daily wage labourers have lost jobs… crores have been deposited with banks… hence there was an expectation from the Budget that the government would provide relief to these unemployed, poor, labourers,” says the letter.
 
 The workers’ union has also drawn the attention of the finance minister to the fact that “the tax relief provided by the Budget to employees is not enough” and that “it is difficult to understand why the government has decided to do away with Foreign Investment Promotion Board”.
