NEW DELHI: Crediting PM  's flagship   with being key to India climbing up the rankings of the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index, Union minister for culture and tourism, Mahesh Sharma, said on Wednesday tourist experience in India improved as a result of greater cleanliness in and around tourist areas. 

 India is among the 15 most-improved countries on the global index and has moved up 12 notches from 52 in 2015 to 40 this year. Spain remains on top of the index, while Yemen brings up the rear ranked 136. 
 
 Sharma said, "We are going beyond the idea of physical cleanliness and attempting to achieve through PM Modi's flagship scheme the dream Mahatma Gandhi had and which couldn't be fulfilled in 70 years. Our initiative has also led to India improving its performance on the World Tourism and Security Indices this year." 
 
  The minister added that the government's initiative to make 116 ticketed heritage monuments polythene free has now also been extended to less frequented monuments across India. 
 
 Sharma made the announcement while holding a joint press conference with drinking water and sanitation minister   on cleanliness activities undertaken by tourism and culture ministry as part of the fortnight-long Swachh Pakhwada. 
 
 The Swachh Paryatan mobile application launched by the ministry in February this year to ensure cleanliness around heritage monuments will be extended to create alerts about insanitary conditions in different parts of cities as well, N K  , secretary of department of culture said.
