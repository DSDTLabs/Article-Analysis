MUMBAI: After roping in actor   as the face of its   campaign, BMC is set to seek Mumbaikars’ votes for the   (survey) 2017 through a short film of its sanitation workers on the job. A total of 30,000 labourers clean Mumbai 24X7. 

 For eight days starting January 26, the two-minute film, ‘Thanks to Banta Hai’, (youtube.com/watch?v=vrAPXpJttRY) will be screened in around 100 cinema halls across the city during the break. With Vande Mantram as its background score, the film shows solid waste management workers cleaning nooks and crannies of the city to urge citizens to vote in the survey. Citizens can vote by giving a missed call on the toll free number 1969 or by visiting swachh-survekshan.in. 
 
 Last year, Mumbai was ranked 10 in the survey, making a jump from 147 in 2015. To survey the city's cleanliness quotient, a team from the   under the Union ministry of urban development, visited Mumbai from January 7-9. The results are expected in mid-February. Mumbai would be appraised for 2000 points, out of which 450 will be based on citizens’ feedback. 
 
 On January 18, Khan tweeted about the film saying “In workers ke liye ‘Thanks’ toh banta hai”. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of A ward and nodal officer for Swachh Bharat Mission, said theatres have a diverse crowd. “The film is sure to attract eyeballs. We hope to get a positive response from the public,” said Dighavkar.
