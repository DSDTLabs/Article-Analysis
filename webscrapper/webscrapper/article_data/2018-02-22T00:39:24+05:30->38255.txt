Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday reserved its order on a batch of cases seeking to allow traditional fishermen living in and around Rameswaram to go to Katchatheevu in Sri Lanka by using mechanised country boats to attend the St. Antony’s church festival there. This year, the festival is scheduled on February 23 and 24. Fr Anthonysamy of Vercode St Soosaiappar church, who is acting as co-ordinator in sending people to the festival has decided to allow only 60 mechanised boats and not any country boat.  To travel in mechanised boat Rs 1, 300 is collected per head. It is not affordable for fishermen in and around Rameswaram as they are very poor. Due to this, they are restrained from attending the festival. Earlier, the fishermen were going by country boats to attend the festival.  This led to the filing of a batch of cases by J Brinso Raymond, Nallathambi and K Thirumurugan before the court. A division bench headed by justice M Sathyanarayanan heard it.  Rameswaram’s tahsildar, as per an earlier direction of the court, appeared before it. The counsel appearing for the government told the court that due to safety concerns, country boats were not allowed. Counsels appearing for the petitioners said that country boats being used by the Rameswaram fishermen are safe to travel. Using the country boats, fishermen can stay and fish in deep sea up to five days.  Besides, the church’s consecration ceremony took place in December 2016, to which Tamil fishermen were not invited. Following it, a case was filed at the high court bench in that regard. With the intervention of the court, a batch of 82 people including priests, nuns and leaders of associations took part in it. To that extent, Katchatheevu festival is traditionally close to Tamil fishermen.  After hearing concerned sides, the bench reserved its order.
