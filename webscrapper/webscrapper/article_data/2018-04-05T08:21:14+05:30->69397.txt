GUWAHATI: Having shocked ISL champions Chennaiyin FC in the Super Cup a few days back,   are eyeing another upset as they take on   in their second group match of the AFC Cup at   here on Thursday.

 
 But it won’t be an easy job for the Santosh Kashyap-coached side. In the coach’s own words: “Bengaluru FC are the best team in the country right now.”
 
 Although they lost in the final of the ISL, they were clearly the team to beat throughout the tournament. And having lost in the final, they are hungry for more right now.
 
 But with the Super Cup also in progress, the coach might rest some of his key players like he has done in the earlier AFC Cup matches. What’s interesting though is even without some of their key players, the two-time I-League champions haven’t had any problem in the tournament so far. They have won all their qualifying matches with ease and have also begun the group stage on a winning note by beating Abahani Dhaka 1-0 at home last month.
 
 On the other hand, Aizawl FC lost their opener against New Radiant 3-1 in Maldives where   scored a brilliant hat-trick. To the dismay of Aizawl FC, Lalramhmunmawia, who scored their only goal, was shown a red card and he will be missing the game against Bengaluru FC.
