Ghaziabad: The   police is likely to introduce the e-challan system in Ghaziabad, GB Nagar and Lucknow soon. Officials said the system could be launched in   in April this year.

 SP (traffic) SN   said: “Under the project, 70 mobile phones equipped with a special application and an equal number of hand-held printers would be given to the traffic personnel for issuing challans. Nearly Rs 16 lakh is estimated to be spent every month on running this system. We hope to get the budget approval by March.”
