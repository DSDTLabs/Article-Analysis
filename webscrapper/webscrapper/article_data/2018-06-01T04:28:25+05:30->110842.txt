MUMBAI: With hundreds of seats going vacant in   across the nation, private institutes accepted applications till Thursday evening.   in the state, which have 181  , too are conducting a “stray vacancy round”.

 “Most of the colleges have not managed to fill the management or   seats,” said  , DMER chairm-an. “They have requested an admission extension. Some co-lleges are also reducing the NRI seat fee.” Deemed universities have also been allowed a relaxation for admitting NRI students. The medical counse-lling panel has allowed stude-nts earlier registered as Indian, to apply as NRI in the stray vacancy round and send the NRI documents through the college authorities. Colleges can admit them provisionally along with an undertaking that if they don’t have the documents, their admission could be cancelled.
