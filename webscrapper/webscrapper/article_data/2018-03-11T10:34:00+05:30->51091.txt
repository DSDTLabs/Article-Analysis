THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After a long, drawn-out legal battle, physically challenged candidates in the deputy collector rank list have finally received justice. It has been learnt that the government has decided to issue an order to appoint a visually challenged candidate, Ajesh K and an orthopedically handicapped candidate,  , as deputy collectors. The posting order is expected by Monday.

 Though the   ( ) has issued the advice for posting and revenue minister E Chandrasekharan has endorsed the order for appointment of the first two disabled candidates for the post of deputy collectors, the candidates are still anxious.
 
 
 “We will remain apprehensive till we are appointed. They said the posting orders from the revenue department is expected to reach us by Monday,” Madhu said.
 
 In February, the PSC had sent advice memos to the two physically handicapped (PH) candidates after the   (KAT) issued an order directing the revenue department to report vacancies to the PSC. The file was approved by the revenue minister this month. The candidates had begun their legal struggles in January 2014, when the PSC published its rank list. Madhu, an MTech in electrical engineering from IIT, Kharagpur had cleared the preliminary tests, final examinations and interview for the post of deputy collector. But to his dismay, not a single PH candidate was included in the rank list.
 
 In August 2015, Madhu filed a petition before KAT pleading for inclusion of PH candidates in the rank list. In October 2015, the KAT directed the PSC to include PH candidates in the list. In March 2016, leading the struggle for PH candidates, he filed a petition again at KAT demanding implementation of the Supreme Court order on appointment of disabled people.
