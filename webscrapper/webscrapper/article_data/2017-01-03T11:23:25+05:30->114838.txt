Panaji: Former Union law minister and former chairman of  , Ramakant Khalap suggested that Goa’s cooperative banks could survive in the digital banking era only through consolidation. 

 Though it already possesses the ability to introduce digital wallets and card transactions to customers, Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank has found the sanctions imposed by the   to be a stumbling block.
 
 “Goan cooperative banks and societies should consider coming together to be in line with the central government’s and RBI’s policy of a strong banking system. By coming together I mean merger, amalgamation, acquisition or collaboration,” Khalap said while speaking to reporters on Monday at the bank’s Panaji branch.
 
 Khalap cited the merger of   with its subsidiaries and the mergers of other private sector banks as an example for local cooperative banks.
 
 The beleaguered cooperative bank has been bearing the brunt of the economy’s sluggishness, RBI sanctions and demonetization. 
 
 Stating that it was difficult to comment on the RBI sanctions as the matter was sub-judice and being heard before the  , Khalap did express hope of a favourable outcome in the coming days.
 
 “We have the core banking technology, we were supposed to launch our in-house ATM and had we done it a day earlier before the sanctions were imposed, we would have been able to offer e-wallets to our customers. The restrictions are preventing the roll-out of digital payment systems,” Khalap rued.
 
 Due to curbs imposed on Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank on issuance of fresh loans, the bank is estimated to have suffered a Rs 2 crore loss.
 
 “The bank’s loan business has been stopped. The bank’s business has been affected. If cash credit facility is permitted then business can pick up. In the last two years, our loan business has been affected,” Khalap stated.
 
 The Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank received Rs 20-25 crore as deposit since November 8 when high denomination notes were withdrawn.
