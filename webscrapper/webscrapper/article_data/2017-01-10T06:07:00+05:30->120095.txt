NEW DELHI: National   ( ) on Monday questioned why east corporation workers were going on strike again and again.

 When a lawyer raised the issue that garbage was not being cleared for days, the NGT bench said it will hear the issue at length on Tuesday. NGT was hearing environmentalist  's application, requesting that local governments implement solid waste management rules.
 
 The east corporation lawyer was not present in court, following which the NGT bench headed by chairperson Justice   deferred the discussion to Tuesday . Since 2015, east corporation sanitation workers have gone on strike five times over non-payment of salaries. This time, it's over non-payment of their November and December salaries.
 
 The Almitra Patel judgement pronounced by NGT recently gave a number of directions to ensure waste management. One was to ensure waste segregation at source-dhalaos should have three compartments for biodegradable waste, non-biodegradable and recyclable, and for hazardous.
 
 NGT had also directed all municipal authorities to draw up “an integrated waste management plan for Delhi, identifying landfill sites, improvement of existing sites, etc...“ within two months.
