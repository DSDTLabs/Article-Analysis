MUMBAI: The city on Wednesday recorded the lowest minimum temperature of January in four years as the mercury dropped to 12.5 degrees Celsius. Met officials said that Wednesday’s minimum temperature was the lowest this season so far. 

 In 2013, the lowest minimum temperature recorded in January was 10.4 degrees Celsius. Officials from the   (IMD) said that minimum temperatures are expected to remain in the same range or even drop further over the next two days. The minimum temperature recorded by the IMD Santacruz observatory on Wednesday morning was 12.5 degrees Celsius, which was 4.4 degrees Celsius below normal. The   observatory recorded a minimum of 17.4 degrees Celsius, which was 1.7 degree Celsius below normal. 
 
 K S Hosalikar, deputy general, western region, IMD said, “Winds are playing a crucial role in this drop in temperatures. Northerly winds are prevailing with no easterly winds. Therefore, there is nothing to block the sea breeze. The easterly winds, which are dry, are generally known to block the sea breeze.” He, however, added that minimum temperatures may rise over the weekend with models indicating that the wind direction may be north-easterly to easterly. “However, there will not be any drastic drop and minimum temperatures will stay around 14-15 degrees Celsius,” said Hosalikar. 
 
 The lowest minimum recorded in January in 2014 and 2015 was 13.2 degrees Celsius and 13.6 degrees Celsius respectively. The all-time low for January in Mumbai was recorded at 7.4 degrees Celsius on January 22, 1962 and in the last 10 years was on January 29, 2012 at 10 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature recorded by the IMD Colaba observatory on Wednesday was 27 degrees Celsius, which was 2.5 degrees Celsius below normal. At the Santacruz observatory, the maximum temperature was 28.7 degrees Celsius, 1.5 degrees Celsius below normal.
