MUMBAI: Six months after   were announced, around 400 final year part-time management students from   ( ) are still waiting for their  . The students had appeared for exams in April last year and the results were announced online by  . The university is completing their eligibility requirements now, almost 10 months after they gave their final exams.

 A Masters of Financial Management batch student said they pursued the course from the premier institute for better career opportunities. “Despite passing all exams, we are waiting pointlessly for six months. In fact, we are yet to get results for previous three semesters too. It is unfair to students as many of us are working and have to submit our documents to our employers,” said a student.
 
 The same batch suffered even when marksheets of 2016 exams were given after a year. “Our marksheets have been coming late in the past too, but this is our final semester. We do not know who is responsible. The university authorities tell us to approach the institute as it went autonomous recently,” said another student.
 
 He added that many students are not from Mumbai and therefore had to complete their eligibility process. “We took admission in 2014. The institute and university could have completed the eligibility process any time in the three years. But students are being told to get migration certificates from home universities now, almost 10 months after we graduated,” said the student.
 
 An institute official said the university had sent the marksheets of the affected students but they had to be returned due to a minor printing error. “Once the error is rectified, we will distribute the marksheets,” said the official. A source said the institute is short-staffed and is finding it difficult to cope with day-to-day work. Many senior administrative staff positions are vacant as the university has to complete the approval process, he added.
