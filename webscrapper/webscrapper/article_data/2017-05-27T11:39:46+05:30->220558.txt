PANAJI: After the high court of Bombay at Goa stayed the reservation of 12 wards in 11 village panchayats, the state election commission ( ) on Friday instructed the returning officers concerned to adhere to the court’s directives and treat the disputed wards as belonging to the general category. 

 “Scrutiny (of nominations) is proceeding as per the high court’s order. Nominations from general category candidates seeking to contest from these reserved wards have also been accepted and nominations filed by candidates belonging to other backward classes ( ) are being considered as general,” an SEC official said.
