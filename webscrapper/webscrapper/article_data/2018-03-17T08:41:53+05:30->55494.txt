HYDERABAD:   (JSP) leader  , who promised to get the support of different parties in the country for the no-confidence motion against the   government, stayed away from playing any such role on Friday.

 On February 19, Pawan had dared YSRCP leader   to move a no-confidence motion against the Modi government and declared that he would be able to garner the support of 80 MPs of various parties to support it.
 
 A few days before that, Jagan had challenged both Pawan and Naidu to support the no-confidence motion. Though Naidu did not formally respond to that, on Friday, TDP MPs gave their consent in writing for the no-confidence motion. While this entire scene unfolded in Delhi with even MIM showing support, Pawan was otherwise busy.
 
 The fact is that the JSP has no MP as it did not contest the 2014 polls. However, Pawan had taken up his own agitation demanding a special status for AP. Though he took up the gauntlet thrown at him by Jagan on the motion, Pawan was nowhere close to even speaking to any party for the support he promised.
 
 When the question was popped to him in Guntur on Friday, he wriggled out of the situation. Without giving any clarity on his own explanation, he got up and left when questioned.
 
 He tried to argue that the   had changed the date of the no-confidence motion and therefore that party should answer the question first.
