HYDERABAD: Despite rising concerns that the nation is disintegrating due to the prevailing climate of fear and suppression of dissent, India's diversity will hold the country together, said  , professor of history at JNU.

 Speaking on 'The making and unmaking of a nation', Mahajan said: “While some fear that the civilizational   of the nation are withering, the breaking up of the nation has been predicted by certain others. But the concept of a `nation in the making' can be used to understand what is happening across the country now. It is an ongoing process. Even in the present, we must consciously try to preserve the unity that we forged during the freedom movement. The role of the state is also very significant but if it does not play its role, our role as citizens becomes more vital."
 
 On the climate of fear prevailing in India, Mahajan said, “Newspapers are replete with instances of lynching of Muslims for suspected consumption of beef or slaughter of cattle. Universities with independent traditions of thought and practice are being muzzled, be it HCU or JNU. Silencing of dissenting voices--the most recent instance of which is the murder of Gauri Lankesh--amounts to suppression of freedom and civil liberty, which are essential for a developing democracy ."
