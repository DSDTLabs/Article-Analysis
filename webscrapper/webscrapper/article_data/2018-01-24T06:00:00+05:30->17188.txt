Kolkata: As many as 33 films, including shorts and documentaries, have been censored in eight days ever since the new regional officer joined at the Kolkata office of the Central Board of Film Certification ( ). The Kolkata office, which was facing many problems after the sudden exit of the earlier regional officer on December 1, has been able to clear much of the backlog.

 “My job is to facilitate the film industry when they apply for the censorship certificate. I am glad that 33 films, including promos and documentaries and feature films, have already been censored since the time I joined. This is a record of sorts,” said Samrat Bandyopadhyay, the current regional officer.
 
 Bandyopadhyay, who is an alumni of IIT-Kharagpur, has cleared controversial films like ‘Rongberonger Korhi’ without any cuts. Among the other important projects to have got his nod are Jeet’s ‘Inspector Notty K’, the trailer and song of Raj Chakraborty-produced ‘Noor Jahaan’ and Swapan Saha’s ‘Jibon Theke Newa’. Besides, he has also certified ‘Life Ek Sangram’, ‘Mahiya’, ‘Gohin Hriday’, ‘Nilachale Kiriti’ and ‘Dhruvakatha’.
