NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition   on Tuesday said that with polls in other states over, AAP should try and make a new beginning in Delhi. Speaking during the budget session, Gupta said: “There was nothing concrete about the government’s plans (in LG’s address on Monday). There is no agenda and the government has strayed from its promises. There is a need for reflection and now that the government can focus in Delhi again, it may want to look at a fresh start,” he said.

 Gupta spoke about AAP government’s key promises of participatory governance, saying that advertising its achievements did not amount to actual realization of work. “The government had allotted Rs 350 crore to mohalla sabhas in the last budget and an additional Rs 220 crore before that. Now, if we even try and talk about it, the government gets angry. It indicates that the government has failed in its agenda. It had promised mechanical sweeping, last-mile connectivity, women safety, etc, but what has been done in these sectors?” Gupta asked.
 
 On education, a sector showcased by the government, Gupta said that against the 500 new schools promised, nothing had been done. There were 29,630 vacancies for teachers and despite special programmes, the quality of education had not improved.
 
 “The government promised to open 900 primary healthcare centres, but there is no commitment on primary health despite the dengue and chikungunya epidemics in 2016. About 30,000 additional beds were to be added, but nothing was done. In the past two years, the government has made no new law and implemented nothing. As a friend, even though I am a critic and belong to the opposition, I will give you an advice. Admit that there have been shortcomings in your work but that you will start work afresh,” Gupta told AAP MLAs.
