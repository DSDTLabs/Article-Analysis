CHENNAI: A team of 500 cops led by city police commissioner A K   turned up at the Kasimedu fishing harbour beach on Saturday morning to help clear around 150 tonnes of waste that had piled up on the shore line. They were joined by corporation and fisheries department officials, fishermen and residents. 

 Following the removal of the waste, the Kasimedu fishing shoreline sported a tidy look from Nagoorar Thottam on one side to the fishing wharf on the other. "We are thankful to all the police personnel who marked their footprints in Kasimedu and made the initiative a success," said Viswanathan.
 
 The move was inspired by a plea from fishermen in the media seeking state government support to help clean-up the beach since they had some time on their hands owing to the ongoing annual fishing ban, said a police official. Following this, the city police called for police volunteers and alerted corporation officials and the fisheries department.
 
 At least 32 fishermen associations volunteered for the clean-up and mobilised local residents to take part. Besides Viswanathan, around 20 senior police officers including additional commissioners of police H M Jayaram and   joined the efforts.
 
 The clean-up started at 7am, with officials involved in the operation until 9am. However, members of the fishermen associations and residents continued to clean the beach after that. 
 
 Senthil, an office-bearer in one of the fishermen associations, said, "This is the first time the beach sand is glittering like gold." Residents expressed happiness that they could now spend their evenings at the Kasimedu fishing harbour beach instead of visiting the Marina.
 
 Director of the fisheries department Sameeran, additional director Mohanasundaram, assistant director Juliet Edward, Chennai corporation north zone deputy commissioner   and district revenue officer Anitha also participated in the event.
