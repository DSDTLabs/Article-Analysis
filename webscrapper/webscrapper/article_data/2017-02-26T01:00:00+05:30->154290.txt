Not always do you head to a pub just to indulge in food and drinks, and make merry with friends on the dance floor. This was one party in Chennai that drew crowd for the gig that was held at the pub. The guests included many from the cityâ€™s music circle like playback singer Shakthisree Gopalan and guitarist Toby, who were in high spirits listening to the live performance. The ones who kept entertaining them were musicians like Jhanu and Pradeep. They were quite impressive with their folk numbers and had the crowd sway in sync with the music. As much as their music, their veshti-look on stage, too, was loved by the audience. Among others, Veronika, Daphne and Vijaya looked dressed up for the party and got other fashionistas talking about their fashion sense.
