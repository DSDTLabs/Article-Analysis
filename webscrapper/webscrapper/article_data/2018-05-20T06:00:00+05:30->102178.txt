It’s been a while since   was seen in a Telugu film. Her last outing was   Jr-starrer  , which released last September. But now, she’s all geared up for her next. “I completed shooting for Gopichand’s   in April and I’m awaiting the release now,” says the actress, who is presently holidaying in the US. Admittedly, it is a “brief but significant” appearance that will showcase her in a hitherto unseen “ultra glam” avatar. “I play an uber rich girl who loves horses. She owns a race course and has a lot of attitude and thinks no end of herself. Yet, she falls head over heels in love with   who wins her over for a reason. You need to watch the movie to find out,” says the actress, signing off.
