BATHINDA: Concerned over the happenings on social and religious fronts especially pertaining to Kargil martyr Mandeep Singh’s daughter  , the left leaning organisation ‘Punjab Lok Sabhyacharak Manch’ has decided to raise the concerns of the people especially women and the   through the  .

 The Manch has decided to run a campaign for one month themed ‘art for people’ to show how concerns of the people could be put forth effectively through art. The campaign will be launched on international women’s day on March 8 and will culminate on April 8, the day when revolutionaries Bhagat Singh and BK Dutt had thrown bombs and paper bills with writing on these that ‘it needs loud noise to make dumb hear’ in central legislative assembly to get their voice heard.
 
 “We have decided to start the campaign on international women’s day as there are some who are trying to silence Gurmehar Kaur,” said Manch president Amolak and general secretary Kanwaljit Khanna.
 
 “Street plays, songs, films will be screened during the one month campaign wherein it will be shown that how the rights of expression of people especially women are being snatched by certain forces with the tacit support of the governments. The art form will be exclusively used to express the desire of free society where no one could be forced to speak against truth. The happenings in the past like attacks on former JNU student council president Kanahiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and now Gurmehar Kaur have made us to believe that it is getting hard to speak truth and express true desires against the extremely right wing forces in India but we will use art form to express truth,” they said.
