VADODARA: With over 100   selling food items in different parts of the city being evicted by the   ( ), the vendors have decided protest over the issue. The vendors submitted a memorandum to the   on Thursday and will be bringing out a rally on Saturday.

 The VMC cracked down on the street vendors since early this week and ousted those operating from the polytechnic, Racecourse, Old Padra Road, Fatehgunj and Akota areas. The civic body claimed that a large majority of these vendors did not have registrations under the Food Safety and Standards Act. On Thursday, VMC officials removed street vendors from the stretch between the Fatehgunj Flyover and Ratribazaar and opposite the Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh. Five food trucks operating on the road opposite the Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh were also impounded by the civic body.
 
 Street vendors claimed that even vendors who had obtained stay orders against their ouster earlier and those who had been given licences to operate were also removed by the civic body. “We have been given clear instructions that we should not start our outlets again. Many have had no income since the last few days,” said a street vendor operating from the Old Padra Road. Some street vendors added that they also made losses on the day when they were asked to stop functioning as they had kept raw material ready for opening the eateries in the evening.
 
 The memorandum submitted to the district collector on Thursday stated that the street vending policy was yet to be implemented by the civic body. 
 
 It added that in its absence the street vendors were not being given alternatives by the civic body.
