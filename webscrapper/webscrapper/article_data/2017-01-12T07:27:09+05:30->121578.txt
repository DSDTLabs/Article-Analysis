NEW DELHI: Stepping up its attack on the AAP government,   has challenged chief minister   for a public debate on funding to corpo rations and development work in the city.

  chief   blamed the CM for para lysing the corporations by not implementing the fourth Delhi Finance Commission recommendations.
 
 The recent strike by sanitation workers has once again revived the debate on municipal funding. BJP said that at the time of trifurcation, the then   government had assured financial assistance to east and north corporations.
 
 “But ever since AAP came to power in Delhi, they have not released funds on time. The government is intentionally withholding the implementation of 4th DFC under which the corporations are to get a substantial amount. I challenge the CM to come and debate on municipal funding,“ said Tiwari.
