Director   who made Malayalis proud recently by winning the Hivos Tiger Award at the International Film Festival of   2017 for his film,  . Soon after the news came out, the director has started receiving threatening messages from the radical Hindu activists!

 Sanal has posted the screenshot of a few of it in his Facebook page. Posting it the director wrote, "I am getting constant threat from a person claimed to be Rahul shrivastava President of Hindu swabhiman sangh. His problem is that my film has hurted his religious sentiments by adding the word "Sexy" before the name of "Goddess Durga". When I said my film has nothing to do with "Goddess Durga" he is asking why I am not putting the name "Sexy Sreeja" to the film. When I said "Sreeja" is also a goddess name, he is telling me that   is my wife's name too. Arrey bhai.. Use the same logic here please.. Durga is name of so many poor girls too.
 
 NB: The second screen shot is a whats ap group this person leads. They are claimed to be the saviours of our culture. I am ashamed to post the comments in that group. (sic)."
