In the recent past, many international artistes and rock bands including Justin Bieber, Ed Sheeran, Demi Lovato and Coldplay have toured India. Now, joining the list is the American band One Republic, who will perform in Mumbai on April 21. The band is known for hits like 'Apologize', 'Counting Stars', 'Let’s Hurt Tonight', 'Secrets' and 'Oh My My'. 

  Talking about the special arrangements made for the band of five, Cyrus Gorimar, director of the event company, which is bringing the band to India, told BT, “There is a lot planned for the musicians. When they arrive in Mumbai, the band will be gifted local souvenirs, which will include Ayurvedic and handloom products. Since the concert venue is NSCI Dome, Worli, we are focusing on what they can do in and around South Mumbai. If they were staying for a little longer, they would have probably liked to go to the Himalayas as well.” Their entourage will include 30 people. Cyrus adds, “One Republic will be accompanied by five of their global security staff. In addition, there will be K9 bomb dogs, who will sweep the backstage on the day of the event. We will also have 250 security personnel.”
 
  The band, which is currently on a two-week Asia tour comprising Singapore, South Korea, China, Malaysia and India, has asked for music equipment of international standards. “There will be no compromise on production. We are importing special lights to match their requirements. It’s going to be a galaxy of lights on the stage,” reveals Cyrus.
