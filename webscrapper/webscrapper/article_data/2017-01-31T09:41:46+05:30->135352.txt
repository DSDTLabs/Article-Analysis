AMRAVATI: State home minister   faces a problem in winning a second term from   constituency, with the teaching community slamming the state’s refusal to grant 71 days pay from their strike period.

 The teachers community feel the state, and Patil, has broken their trust. “While Patil spoke of releasing the payment after the polls, the education minister is ordering otherwise. What is this? The CM thrice spoke of BT Deshmukh’s work, but has not solved a single issue raised by BT,” said Gajendra Raghuwanshi of Smt Kesharbai Lahoti Mahavidyalaya.
 
 Dr Prashant Vighe of BS Patil College, Paratwada, agreed, “Patil did nothing in six years, even when he was a minister.” Sushil Kalmegh of   said, “He disregarded university senate and ignored graduates’ problems.”
 
 Vivek Deshmukh of  , however, feels Patil will get good response in Yavatmal. “Irrespective of his failures, educational institutes here are BJP-focused,” he said. Nonetheless, there appears to be rough weather ahead for Patil.
