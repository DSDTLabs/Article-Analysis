Chandigarh: For 580 seats in the first-year Master of Commerce MCom course in 11 city colleges, the UT higher education department has announced the admission schedule. Doors opened after Panjab University declared the BCom honours and general results.

 The department has given the candidates only a one-time option to edit their forms. Besides, for the 235 vacant seats left in the BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) course after the second counselling, the candidates were asked to approach the respective colleges. After two rounds of counseling, the empty seats in any course will be filled by the respective college instead of through third counselling.
 
 Physical presence of the candidate is important during counselling. While editing their forms, the candidates must upload all required documents along with a grand total of six semester scores and a separate proof of the honours result.
