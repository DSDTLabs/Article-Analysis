Actor Kavi Shahstri who was last seen in not one but two   winning movies, 
  and at home front in 
 , is feeling ecstatic. Quiz him if he was expecting his movies receiving such a stupendous award, he shared, “Honestly, I wasn’t expecting anything, and had given my 100% to both the movies. But I’m at loss for words as both the films that I have been a part of, won National Awards this year. I couldn’t have asked more.”

 Ask him if he’s working on any other Gujarati movies, he said, “I would love to do more Gujarati movies. However, presently I’m in talks with Mikhil (director, 
 ) on some interesting scripts and we plan to bring out something good, soon.”
