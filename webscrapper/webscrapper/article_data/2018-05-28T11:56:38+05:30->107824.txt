VELLORE: The Arcot Town police on Sunday booked a man on charges of attempting to rape a six-year-old girl at a marriage hall here on Thursday. 

 
 The incident took place on Thursday night when the girl along with her mother went to attend a reception at a private marriage hall in Arcot. Both the mother and daughter, a native of Katpadi, spent the night in the marriage hall as they had to take part in the wedding rituals the next day.
 
  alias Appu, also from Katpadi, too had come to attend the marriage reception. He saw the   girl sleeping next to her mother. Manikandan, who was in an   condition, abducted the girl, took her to the terrace of the building and tried to rape her after placing a piece of cloth in her mouth. But the girl managed to escape from the clutches of the man, rushed to her mother and told her everything.
 
 Manikandan, however, fled the spot. Based on a complaint from the victimâ€™s mother, the Arcot Town police on Sunday registered a case against Manikandan and launched a hunt for the   accused.
