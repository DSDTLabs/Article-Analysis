Exercising, like all other schedules, needs to be constantly reinvented, involving newer styles and poses. It keeps you hooked for long and shows the desired results. Fitness trainers realise the need to introduce newer poses to avoid muscle fatigue or injury; to avoid over repetition of same style and posture over a longer duration and, most importantly, to beat monotony.

 Here are three ways to do away with the mundane in your workouts. These exercises are becoming popular in gyms across the globe and are a great way to enjoy bodyweight training â€”
 
 
 Balance your body on your palms and feet with face towards the ceiling. This is a full body workout that works out your triceps, upper arms, shoulders, back, abs and hamstring and calf muscles. You move forward with your feet and hand and need to perfect your crab posture and body balance before attempting the walk.
 
 
  It is the simplest and easiest way to introduce and train your body to bodyweight training. Just hang from an overhead bar by holding it with your hands for as long as possible to strengthen your grip, arms, shoulders and neck region. Before doing anything fancy involving pulling yourself up for shoulder and back training or leg raises while hanging for abs training, it is best to practice and perfect the dead hang pose.
 
 
  You know the baby crawl, now make it a bit more strenuous by walking on your hands and toes rather than hands and knees like a bear. 
 Balance your body on your palms and toes and try and move forward. It is a very good workout to warm up and strengthen the core of the body. Once you perfect it, you can add variations to it such as crawling on elbows and toes or crawling with dumbbells in hand.
