AHMEDABAD: The state education department has initiated a probe in connection with alleged irregularity in recruitment at a Hindi-medium private school in Soni’s Chawl area of the city. The development follows the district education officer’s surprise visit to the school on Monday. Documents were seized from the school during the visit. 

 According to sources, the school management had recruited the school-owner’s two sons, daughter, and son-in-law as teachers a couple of years ago. An anonymous complaint had been filed with the DEO. The complaint said that the daughter and son-in-law of the school-owner did not have the requisite qualifications.
 
 “The daughter of the school-owner had passed MA, when she was just 18, from a university of a northern state,” a source said. “How can that be possible? The state administration must conduct a thorough probe.”
 
 The school has the status of a linguistic-minority organization so the management has the right to recruit without taking the approval of the government. 
 
 Misusing this right, the school management had recruited their own family members, said sources.
 
 A source said that through the irregularity in recruitment, the school management seems to have siphoned off funds to the tune of lakhs from the state government which must be recovered from the owner.
 
 In the past, the owners of a Hindi-medium school in   were booked under similar charges. Sources said that some state education department officials connive with various school managements who are allegedly involved in irregular recruitment. 
 
 If action is initiated against the schools, officials will have to file a police complaint and recover the money taken by unqualified teachers. 
 
 So, sources said, officials are asking the teachers or school staff whose recruitment is irregular to resign to avoid any legal trouble.
