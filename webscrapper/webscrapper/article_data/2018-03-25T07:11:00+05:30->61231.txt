Ludhiana: A 14-year-old class IX student of BVM School, Udham Singh Nagar — Tamanna Gupta — has allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling fan of her home in Netaji Park of Haibowal on Friday night. According to the family, the girl was under mental pressure ahead of her re-appear exam results.
