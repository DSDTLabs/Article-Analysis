While some films these days target a niche audience, director Anees Bazmee’s ' ' is touted to cater to one and all. The film, said to be squeaky clean with no double-meaning dialogues and intimate scenes, is a family entertainer, which everyone -- children, parents and grandparents -- can watch together. 

 The comic caper, which has real-life 
    and   teaming up for the first time, has also got a go ahead from the Censor Board. Apart from Anil’s witty one-liners and Arjun’s 
  double role, the movie also features fun-filled performances by Athiya Shetty and Ileana D’Cruz. 
 
 Says Anees, “This is the kind of film you can watch with your entire family; not even for a moment will you feel awkward. There’s awesome chemistry between all the characters. I have worked with Anil in so many movies, but his character of Kartar Singh will not only make people laugh, but also make them cry. Also, Karan and Charan, the two wonderful characters played by Arjun, will make the audience fall in love with him.”
