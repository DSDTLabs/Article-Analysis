Surat: Three shops built illegally near Subhash Nagar community hall at Nilgiri Circle were sealed by Limbayat zone officials of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) on Tuesday. 

 The shops were in the name of wife of former deputy mayor Dr Ravindra Patil, who had left the BJP to join the Congress. 
 
 Limbayat zone officials said owners had made applications to get the shops regularized under impact rule of 2016. However, the applications were rejected because the shops were constructed after the cut-off date. 
 
 “We issued them notices for demolition of illegal structures, but there was no response. We sealed the properties on Tuesday,” a SMC officer said. At present, the 200 sq feet size shops were in possession of tenants.
