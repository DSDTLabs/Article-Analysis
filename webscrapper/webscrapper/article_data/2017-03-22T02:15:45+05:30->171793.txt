NEW DELHI: Chief minister   appeared before a Delhi court in a   filed by Delhi and District Cricket Association ( ) and cricketer-turned-politician  , after the court asserted that following previous summons, Kejriwal was required to establish his identity before it even if he was seeking exemption. The court granted him bail in the case.

 One of the grounds on which Kejriwal’s lawyers V K Ohri, Rishikesh Kumar and Irshad sought dropping of proceedings was that Chauhan had failed to appear in the court on the second occasion. Metropolitan magistrate (MM) Abhilash Malhotra, however, was not convinced because the case was listed for the CM’s appearance and Kejriwal had already been granted an exemption previously.
 
 Kejriwal was not present when the hearing in the case began, but the court insisted that the CM’s presence was necessary. “Constitution has given immunity to governors and the President... CMs are not exempted,” Malhotra said. Kejriwal appeared in the court at 3.45 pm, following which the court granted him bail on a personal bond of Rs 10,000 and a surety of the like amount.
 
 Meanwhile, suspended   MP Kirti Azad, who is co-accused in the defamation case, moved a discharge application. Azad has already been granted bail. The court adjourned the hearing on the applications filed by Kejriwal and Azad to April 1 when the complainants have been directed to file replies. The two leaders have been accused by the DDCA and Chauhan of allegedly making defamatory statements by alleging financial irregularities in the cricketing body, including a sex racket.
