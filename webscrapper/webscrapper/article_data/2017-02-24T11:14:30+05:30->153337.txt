UDAIPUR:   has produced challan against Divya Kothari, the self-proclaimed ‘psyco-killer’ in the much sensational lawyer   that shook the city in December last year. Mangilal Punwar, SHO Sukher police station produced the 141-page descriptive challan in an Udaipur court Thursday. 

 Accused Divya Kothari was brought to the court around 10 am, however, he was produced before the magistrate in the evening. Next hearing in this case will be held on March 8. He was kept inside the court jail throughout the day. The guards were cautious for his protection fearing the fury among bar members as the victim was a member of Udaipur bar association and a budding lawyer herself.
 
 Divya tried hiding his face in shame when he was brought in open. The 32-year old lawyer’s body was found inside the store of her flat in an eight-storey apartment in New Bhupalpura area on December 1. Initially, police had suspected her husband behind the murder. However, the real culprit came out to be Ruchita’s neighbor Divya Kothari, a 22-year-old CA aspirant who surrendered before the police. 
 
 Initially, he had put up a psychic act and claimed to commit the murder innocently under fits of depression to gain public sympathy but later, he confessed he had an intense crush on ‘Ruchita aunty’.
 
 He tried to molest her and when the lawyer resisted, he smashed her head and stabbed her to death. Udaipur bar association had announced that none of its members would plead for the accused and thus a courtappointed lawyer is representing him.
