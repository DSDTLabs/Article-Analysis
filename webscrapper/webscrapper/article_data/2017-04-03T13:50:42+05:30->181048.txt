 Macy Gray said she regrets spoiling her three kids. 

 The 49-year-old singer did not want to be a hard parent like her mother was, so when it came to raising  , 22,  , 21, and 19-year-old Happy - her children with ex-husband   - she was not very strict, something which she now regrets. 
 
 "My biggest regret is that I wasn't harder on my kids. They're really spoilt. I should've been a lot stricter, like my mum. But I didn't want to be like her, so they got away with a lot. It's too late now," she said. 
 
 However, the ' ' hit-maker is really close to all her children and feels grateful they know her very well.
