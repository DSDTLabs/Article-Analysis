GURUGRAM: In an audit of   in the past six years, police have found 693 licences that were re-registered, following an FIR filed against two persons for allegedly getting 15 fake firearms licences ‘renewed’ in   on the basis of forged documents.

 Cops have now sought a district- and state-wide verification of these licences and physical verification of the licence holders. 
 
 A   (SIT) led by ACP (Sadar) Anil Yadav, under supervision of joint commissioner of police Sibash Kabiraj, unearthed the racket for fake firearms licences, after auditing details from 2010 to 2016. They found 693 licences that were re-registered on the basis of the no objection certificate (NOC) of different states. 
 
 “We’ve marked 693 firearm licences which were re-registered in the last six years. We’ll thoroughly probe the matter, beginning at state and district levels. Those arms procured through fake documents will be seized only after physical verification of licence holders, and the guilty arrested,” Kabiraj said.
 
 It may be noted that following the special probe conducted by Kabiraj, an FIR was registered against Manish Bhardwaj and Mohan Lal on February 11 in the case. A day later Mohan Lal was arrested. 
 
 Bhardwaj who is still at large, has sought anticipatory bail through his lawyer, who moved a city court on Wednesday. Sources said the court has fixed February 17 to hear the plea.
