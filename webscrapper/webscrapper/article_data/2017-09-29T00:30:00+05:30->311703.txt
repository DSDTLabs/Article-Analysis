Mysuru: A prisoner who had escaped while on parole has been arrested after seven years by the Bannur  .

 Parashivamurthy (44) was nabbed from Gagenahalli village in Bilikere Hobli on Wednesday. He was jailed for murdering his first wife in Gadag and was shifted to the Mysuru prison in 2011. 
 
 In June 2011, he got a 30-day parole to see his sick mother. His parole was later extended by 60 days, but he never returned to the prison. The Bannur Police had registered a case.
 
 According to the police, a trap was laid after receiving a tip-off that Parashivamurthy had purchased a bike. After the information was confirmed by the RTO concerned, a police team raided his house in Bilikere Hobli on Wednesday and arrested him.
 
 During interrogation, he revealed that he was working as an electrician in a chemical factory in Hootagalli and had married a woman named Mangalagouri. He also had two children.
