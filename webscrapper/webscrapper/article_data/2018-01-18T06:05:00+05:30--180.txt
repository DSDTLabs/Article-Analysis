Noida: Realty firm   has been booked for allegedly cheating a homebuyer, police said on Wednesday.

 An FIR has been filed at Sector 58 police station under Section 420 (cheating) of IPC against the developer after the homebuyer complained he was duped of Rs 88 lakh in the name of a flat at Amrapali Grand housing society in Greater Noida’s Sector Zeta I.
 
 In his complaint, Surendra Singh, a resident of R K Puram Delhi, claimed that he booked a flat in Amrapali Grand in March 2009 and subsequently held a meeting with the company directors, Anil Sharma and Ritik Sinha and also paid Rs 18 lakh as a token advance.
 
 According to Singh, he then took a loan of Rs 70 lakh from IDBI Bank and transferred the money to the developer in the second phase as the advance payment. 
 
 “Amrapali had promised no EMI till possession. The developer had instead promised to pay the EMI to the bank till possession,” complainant Surendra Singh said.
 
 But in May 2017, Singh received information from the bank that the developer had not paid EMI for seven months. 
 
 He then rushed to see his booked flat only to find some other person living there. That person was allotted the flat in April 2015, he said in his complaint.
 
 “I then met the developer and discussed the issue. But the developer did not give any clear answer as to why my flat was allotted to another person,” he said.
 
 Singh then met Gautam Budh Nagar SP (rural) Suniti and lodged a complaint. 
 
 Police investigated the matter and prima facie found his allegations to be true. Cops also served two notices on the developer but did not get any response, following which the FIR was registered.
 
 Amrapali Group officials did not put across their version to investigating officials, despite repeated requests.
