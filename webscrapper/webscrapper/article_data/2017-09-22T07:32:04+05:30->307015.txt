PUNE: The   and some localities along   experienced a major power outage on Thursday afternoon following an explosion in a damaged underground line.

 The ordeal of the residents of these areas is likely to continue for the next couple of days because the damaged cables would be fixed only after spare parts reach the city from Chennai. Nearly three to four hours of power cuts would be enforced to manage the power supply in these areas, stated a press release issued by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL). Nearly 2.5 lakh residents were affected due to this on Thursday.
 
 “The underground supply line was damaged when the cleaning work was being carried out near Dattawadi. The cables were damaged by JCB machines, used for cleaning the area after heavy showers. The damaged cables and the increased moisture in the atmosphere led to the blast, interrupting the power supply at 2.30pm on Thursday,” stated the release.
 
 The authorities are working to fix the problem. The damaged 132KV line is used for power transmission between Rasta Peth and Parvati substations. Steps are being taken to provide electricity from other substations to these areas.
 
 The specific electrical parts needed to repair the special supply line have been requisitioned from Chennai. They will reach the city in the next couple of days, after which the restoration work will be completed.
 
 The MSEDCL will have to manage 80KV electricity shortage during this period. It will be done through power cuts. “Residential and commercial supply have to be curtailed. The citizens should use electricity judiciously. Generators should be used only for commercial activities,” stated the release.
