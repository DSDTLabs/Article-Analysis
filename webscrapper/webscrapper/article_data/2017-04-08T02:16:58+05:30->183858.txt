GHAZIABAD: A sense of unease and fear prevailed in Bhopura’s  , a colony inhabited mostly by migrant workers, from where the leopard was rescued on Friday morning. According to the residents, many of whom have been living there for two decades, they are scared that leopard attacks could happen again.

 “We were fortunate that no one was killed in the leopard attack but after this incident there is a lingering fear that it might happen again,” said  , in whose house the big cat took shelter.
 
 Shyama Devi, mother of three schoolgoing children, said, “We cannot dismiss the incident as a one-off. Now I fear for the lives of our children. The administration must do something.”
 
 Now, the residents are so terrified that many of them stayed awake the whole night fearing that there may be another leopard on the prowl. “We stood guard and many youths remained awake the whole night. We have to maintain vigil in the area,” said Ankit, another resident.
 
 “The only possible route through which the leopard could have entered the colony was through the Hindon Air Force Station,” he said.
 
 However, forest department officers claimed it was a one-off incident. B P Singh, district forest officer, said, “Some leopards do stray but the likelihood of a leopard coming so close to human habitation and attacking people is rare.”
