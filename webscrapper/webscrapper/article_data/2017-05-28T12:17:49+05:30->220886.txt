PANAJI: The   (CBCS), which will be implemented at the undergraduate level from 2017-18, has been amended by   so that students of BA, BSc and BCom honours programme now need to choose their specialisation only at the third year level. Previously, the   approved for implemention allowed only BCom honours students to select their specialisation in third year and students of BA and BSc honours would have to choose their specialisation right from the first year.

 Many teachers felt that first year would be too early for students of BA and BSc honours programmes to decide their specialisation. Accordingly, the OC-66 ordinance has been amended by GU.
 
 The honours programme will be offered from 2017-18 in GU affiliated colleges as a result of the introduction of the CBCS. While the students of the regular programme will have to complete 132 credits, those of the honours programme will have to complete 148 credits.
 
 The CBCS is finally ready to be implemented in Goa University affiliated colleges for the BA, BCom, BSc, BCA and   programmes. The CBCS was kept on hold last year, after colleges said that they did not feel prepared enough for its implementation and had also sought some changes in the new system.
 
 After making the suggested changes in the CBCS, Goa University also decided to introduce new programmes of BA honours, BSc honours, BCom honours from 2017-18.
 
 It will be, however, left to the colleges if they want to offer the honours programmes.
 
 Once the CBCS is introduced, the system of education in colleges across Goa will change as students' performance will be allotted grades.
