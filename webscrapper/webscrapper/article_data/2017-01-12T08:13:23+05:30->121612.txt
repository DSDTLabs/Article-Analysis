CHARMINAR: Majlis-e-Itte hadul   president   on Wednesday demanded that the   (TRS) government table the   report on   firing in legislative assembly.

 The Hyderabad parliamentarian was reacting to a TOI report which said that the state government is unwilling to provide a copy of the report to Right to Information activist SQ Masood who had sought a copy for academic purposes. The commission was constituted days after the police opened fire on the crowd in the aftermath of the Mecca Masjid blast on May 18, 2007. It was tasked with investigating the firing.
 
 Taking to the micro-blogging site Twitter, Owaisi as ked why the report was not tabled. “The Telangana govt should place report on 17 when Assembly meets why is it being kept in wraps as some sort of “State Secret“ (sic),“ he tweeted.
 
 Speaking to TOI, he said, “Though the TRS government was not in power then, the facts have to come out. The purpose of the commission of inquiry would fail if people are not told of its conclusions, whatever they may be. Action taken reports should be there. The people have a right to know.“
 
 Noted lawyer S R Mahajir who was Owaisi's counsel during the commission hearing said that several discrepancies were noted in affidavits submitted by cops who were serving then. He said that there was evidence that police acted in a biased manner. He also said that affidavits submitted by three cops were the same and even carried the same errors. “The police version was false. And people must be held accountable,“ he said.
