Vadodara: The Vadodara district consumer forum has ruled that Madhya Gujarat Company Ltd (MGVCL) is liable to pay to customers who have lost their electronic appliances due to a fault committed by the state-run companyâ€™s staffers. The consumer forum has directed the power distribution company to pay 20% cost of electronic appliances to six of the 12 complainants who could produce bills of their products. MGVCL had installed a distribution point at Sayajipura in November 2008 to give electricity connection for water works of Sayajipura gram panchayat. However, the MGVCL employees fixed wrong wires in the transformer. Due to the error, when the electricity was restarted, high voltage current passed through the electric line, leaving appliances in 12 houses damaged. The consumers complained to MGVCL after the incident and the officials told them that their problem would be solved within 20 days. However, when no action was taken, they approached the consumer court in 2009. When the notice was issued to the MGVCL, it denied that any error was committed by its staffers and that the company was not responsible for the damage to the appliances. However, during the subsequent hearings of the case, six people produced invoices of their damaged appliances. The complainants also submitted affidavits to the court affirming that it the high voltage passing through the electric line damaged their appliances. The court upheld their evidences as MGVCL did not submit any proofs denying the allegations made by the complainants. As only six complainants submitted invoices, the court ordered MGVCL to pay them 20% of the cost along with 8% interest since the time the complaint was registered in the court.
