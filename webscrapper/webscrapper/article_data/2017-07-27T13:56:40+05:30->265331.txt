 About the turban ban in France, Tanmanjit said that it was incredibly ironic and extremely disappointing that more than 80,000 turbaned Sikh solders laid down their lives for the country where their descendants couldn’t even wear turbans for taking photos for identity cards and their children couldn’t go to state schools without removing the turban. He said, “These issues need to be highlighted.”
 
 Later talking to newspersons, the Labour Party MP said he was overwhelmed and very touched by the love and affection shown by the people of  . “I am proud to be a Sikh. I am also the voice of my constituency Slough and according to Sikh ethos ‘sarbat da bhala’ (welfare of all), I am there for the betterment of the whole community, regardless of colour or creed.”
 
 With regards to the documents that were uncovered about UK’s role in Operation Bluestar, he said that his party had assured of an independent inquiry on UK government’s involvement in the June 1984 attack on the Golden Temple.
 
 About the demand of Khalistan by various Sikh groups in the UK, he said different people had different viewpoints. “If people get justice, which they deserve, then I am sure people’s minds change. If people feel aggrieved and their discontent is not looked into, then it all continues.” He said it was up to the governments to deliver justice and if it was delivered then people would move on.
