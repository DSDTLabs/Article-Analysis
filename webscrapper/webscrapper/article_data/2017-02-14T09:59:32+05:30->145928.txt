MUMBAI:  's dropped chance off the bowling of   probably proved too costly in the end for  . For, the benefactor of that reprieve was one of the most exciting young talents in the country .  , who was let off while batting on ten by Wankhede at long leg, went on to score a 36-ball 67.

 His knock ensured East Zone opened their campaign in the   T20 Inter-Zonal tournament at the Wankhede Stadium on a winning note. Chasing Central Zone's target of 151, East cruised to a seven-wicket win.Having put Central into bat after winning the toss, East Zone's decision was vindicated when they managed to send two Central batsmen back to the pavilion in the very first over. First to depart was Mahipal Lomror. In a childish mix-up, the two openers -skipper Naman Ojha and Lomror collided in the middle of the wicket attempting a second run. Amabti Rayudu was the next man to go. Ashoke Dinda, bowl ing the last delivery of his first over, induced an edge and Kishan accepted the sitter without any fuss.
 
 With two wickets down so early , the repair work for Central Zone was going to be a daunting one. But, new man Harpreet Singh, who had scored a 42ball 62 against West Zone in a winning cause, combined well with Ojha. The duo added 76 runs for the third wicket and gave Central a semblance of hope.Harpreet though, looking good for a half century , was dismissed by Writtick Chatterjee. Ojha did manage to go on and complete his half century (51) but Central couldn't build a substantial partnership after that, and ended up scoring a modest 151.
 
 East Zone openers, Shreevats Goswami (15) and Kishan gave them a solid start, with the latter doing the bulk of the scoring. Kishan slammed 7 sixes in his 36 ball knock. After Goswami was run out when the team's score was 41, Kishan was joined by Ishank Jaggi (51*). And by the time Kishan was out, East had put on 112 runs on the board.
