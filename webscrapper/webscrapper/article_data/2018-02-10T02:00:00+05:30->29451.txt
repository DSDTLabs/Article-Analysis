PATNA: Leader of opposition in Bihar Assembly   will commence the first phase of his ‘Samvidhan Bachao Nyay Yatra’ from Katihar on Saturday. The former deputy CM will visit four Seemanchal districts – Katihar, Purnia, Kishanganj and Araria – in the first leg of his Yatra.

 Talking to mediapersons at Patna while leaving for Katihar on Friday, Tejashwi said he decided to launch the Yatra to get justice for people of Bihar as well as his family and to bring truth in front of common people.
 
 “Chief minister Nitish Kumar has got special security, but no special status or package has been given to Bihar,” he said. Tejashwi rapped the state government for “deteriorating law and order”. “While BJP parliamentarian Ananat Kumar Hegde talks of changing the constitution, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat calls for abolishment of reservation. In such a grave situation, it is our responsibility to protect the Constitution,” he added.
 
 Tejashwi said all allegations against his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad were false and it was a tactic to trap him for raising voice for oppressed and marginalised people of the society.
 
 Tejashwi’s mother and newly appointed vice-president of RJD Rabri Devi extended her blessing to her son. “People should hold faith in Tejashwi. He will help them in getting justice besides uniting the secular forces in the country,” Rabri said.
 
 Meanwhile, the two ruling parties – JD (U) and BJP – attacked Tejashwi for launching the Yatra. BJP’s Nand Kishor Yadav said those who mock the Constitution are now taking out Yatras to protect it.
 
 JD (U) spokesperson Sanjay Singh said Tejashwi should have taken a chartered accountant with him during his Yatra, so that he could explain to the people how he had gathered so much of wealth.
 
 Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, however, said everyone has a right in democracy to take out yatras and processions.
