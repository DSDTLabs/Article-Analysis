SONARPUR: A girl in Sonarpur, who was set to take the Madhyamik examination this year, was murdered after allegedly being raped by her boyfriend on Monday. 

 The 16-year-old was found dead in her study with her head smashed and clothes partially ripped off, leading cops to suspect she was raped before being killed. 
 
 “We are questioning Tapas Das, whose photograph was found in her wallet, and will arrest him if necessary,” said SDPO Baruipur Arko Banerjee. 
 
 The body was discovered by the girl’s grandmother who went to wake her up around 4.30am. She usually woke her granddaughter in the early morning since she was studying for the exams. 
 
 Having lost her mother at just 22 months, the victim mostly lived with her grandmother in Sonarpur’s Leninagar, a stone’s throw from her father’s house in the adjoining Laskarpur locality. 
 
 The victim’s father told police that he suspects the youth whose photograph the girl kept in her wallet. The boy, he alleged, was behind his daughter’s  . 
 
 “He would regularly call and irritate my daughter,” he said.
