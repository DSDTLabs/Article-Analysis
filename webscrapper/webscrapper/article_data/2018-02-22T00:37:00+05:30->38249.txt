Madurai: People go to Rameswaram to wash away their sins in the last stage of their lives but here we see a person claiming to start his political journey from there, said revenue minister R B Udayakumar taking a jibe at actor-turned politician Kamal Haasan’s itinerary leading to the launch of his party.  “But let me tell him that there is no vacancy in the political space now,” the minister said while addressing a meeting organized to distribute welfare measures to people at Anna Nagar here on Wednesday. He said that there was no dearth of political parties, flags and policies in Tamil Nadu. “We came into public service at a very young age and were guided by Amma who donated all her jewellery to the army during a war. Then she became a famous actor but had no intention to join politics,’’ he said. Similarly, he said, EPS and OPS had been in public life for more than 45 years and knew the needs and problems of the people. ``People who claim that Tamil Nadu should be led by a Tamil are forgetting that EPS is a pure-bred Tamil,’’ he said.  Madurai North MLA V V Rajan Chellappa said that people did not seem to understand the term public service, which should have been something that one did throughout his or her life. ``I entered politics at the age of 17 and minister Udayakumar at the age of 16, but today people are coming into politics at the age of 64 and 68 when they would have come to receive government pension like the senior citizens,’’ he said. Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao presided over the function. It was announced that 13,000 people had registered for the free two-wheeler scheme in Madurai. As many as 124 people were given benefits under various schemes. They included 46 who got old-age pension, five, widow pensions and 35 people who got disability benefits.
