BENGALURU: A 22 year-old mother allegedly   before immolating herself in their makeshift shed at  , southeast Bengaluru, on Thursday morning.

 The deceased are M Ramalingamma, M Jaswanth, 4, and M Hasini, 2. 
 
 Her husband, Magendran, a mason, told police that Ramalingamma was being treated at Nimhans for depression and might have taken the extreme step because of the illness. The couple from Vellore in Tamil Nadu worked as dailywage workers, police said.
 
 The incident came to light around 10am when neighbours saw smoke billowing out of the shed. Magendran had left for work then.
 
 “Shabarish, a neighbour, saw smoke coming out of the shed and rushed in. All three were caught in flames. Shouts and screams of the victims might not have been heard as TV was on in the house,” police said. Though neighbours tried their best to douse the flames by pouring water and wrapping the victims in a rug, the trio succumbed to burns on the spot.
