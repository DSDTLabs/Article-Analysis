PANAJI: Five senior ranking police officers were given new postings as the state government has begun the process of transferring police officers, on the demand of the BJP-led government’s alliance partners. 

 Superintendent of police (crime) Umesh Gaonkar will take over as SP (security wireless — control room). Bosco George, current SP (security wireless — control room) has been posted as SP (ACB). More than one-and-a-half-year ago, George was shifted as ACB in charge after then CM Laxmikant Parsekar’s brother-in-law was allegedly caught by ACB sleuths while dealing with some plots of the industrial development corporation.
 
 Priyanka Kashyap, current in charge of the special branch, has been made SP (crime and special branch). Kartik Kashyap has been retained as SP (North). The husband-wife duo has long been transferred by the Union home ministry, but has not been relieved by the state government.
 
 DIG Vimal Gupta, who was in charge of the crime branch, will now be handling coastal security portfolio. DIG Bhairon Singh Gurjar has been shifted to the police headquarters and will be supervising the functioning of SP (HQ), SP (legal and vigilance), police training school, IRB, election cell, motor transport, home guard and civil defence, and the economic offences cell.
 
 DIG   has been given the charge as DIG (Range) and will also act as head of SIT to investigate mining-related cases. SP (traffic)   has been given the addition charge of ATS as well.
