PATNA: The second round of MDA (mass   administration) against ‘lymphatic filariasis’ in Bihar will be held in Jehanabad and Shekhpura districts from February 19 to 24.

 A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting presided over by the State Health Society Bihar (SHSB) executive director Lokesh Kumar Singh on Thursday.
 
 Singh has written to the Jehanabad and Shekhpura civil surgeons to ensure that the MDA round was conducted properly. “All persons above two years of age will be given the drug. Children less than two years of age, pregnant women and seriously ill people will be exempted,” said Singh.
 
 According to SHSB’s additional director and state programme officer Dr Bipin Kumar Sinha, MDA rounds are conducted once a year. It will be conducted in other districts in the next few months.
 
 “The aim is to control the transmission of lymphatic filariasis,” he said and added the SHSB would ensure coverage of every household in Jehanabad and Shekhpura districts in the allotted five days. 
 
 While appealing to the people of the two districts to come forward and take the medicine provided by health workers, Dr Sinha said after the current round of MDA, a mop-up round would be conducted (if need be) ) for the left-over people.
 
 “As per the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme, over 65 crore Indians are at the risk of contracting lymphatic filariasis. With 3,89,972 cases of lymphatic filiarisis in Bihar, the state is one of the most critical states in filiarisis elimination progamme in the country,” said Dr Sinha.
 
 Lymphatic filariasis, also called elephantiasis, is a neglected tropical disease wherein filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The infection is usually acquired in childhood and causes hidden damage to the lymphatic system.
 
 The World Health Organization is supporting the state government with logistics for the MDA rounds.
