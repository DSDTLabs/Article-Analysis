MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday rapped the   government for failing to come up with a solution to rehabilitate encroachers on and along the   water pipeline. 

 A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Riyaz Chagla expressed their dissatisfaction with an affidavit filed by the chief secretary. The bench observed that it seemed that the state was "not interested" in complying with the court orders. The judges wondered if there was no other place in Mumbai where the encroachers could be rehabilitated and emphasised that the encroachments posed a security threat to the city.
 
 Of the 160km water pipleline running through the city, around 90 km is above ground. In an affidavit in 2009, the corporation admitted that there were around 15,000 illegal structures on the pipeline-mainly from Balkum to Mulund and then beyond Maroshi. As per recent estimates, over 1 crore persons have to be rehabilitated. 
 
 The state had allotted 11,633 flats in Eversmile Layout in Mahul to project affected persons, including 5,862 families who had encroached on the Tansa pipeline. But the rehabilitation plan has been stuck following orders of the   over pollution in Mahul. The court has asked the chief secretary to file an affidavit by April 27 with details of illegal structures demolished and persons rehabilitated so far as well as the number of structures yet to be demolished and the number of persons eligible for rehabilitation.
