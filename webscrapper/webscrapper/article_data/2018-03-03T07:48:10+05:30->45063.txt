HYDERABAD: All India   president  's declaration that the party would like to win more seats in the 2019 elections will upset the calculations of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) for the upcoming polls. 

 Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) and TRS have already reached an understanding to face the next elections as friendly parties. According to sources, TRS had informed   that it would get the support of TRS in the seven assembly seats it holds as of now. What is expected from the MIM is obvious - support from other constituencies.
 
 It is based on such an unwritten deal that chief minister   recently declared with confidence that it would win 106 out of 119 seats. In the 2014 elections, the TRS had won 66 assembly seats and 17 parliament seats. 
 
 On Friday, at the 60th foundation day celebrations of  , party president Asaduddin Owaisi declared the aim of MIM was to win more seats in the next polls. In the 2014 elections, it had contested four Lok Sabha and 21 assembly seats in Telangana but won only the   seat and seven assembly seats. 
 
 In the light of Owaisi's statement, coming to a decision on seat-sharing with MIM will not be easy for TRS as it will not be willing to allow MIM to increase its tally. TRS had won the GHMC polls with a majority winning 99 out of 150 wards, upsetting MIM calculations. 
 
 "MIM has understood that TRS is formidable. It is in its own interest that it should accept the support of TRS in the seats it holds now. If it makes demands for more seats, it will not be met by the party," a senior TRS leader told TOI. "The TRS government is working for the welfare of minorities. Muslims are in favour of TRS and not MIM," a TRS leader said.
