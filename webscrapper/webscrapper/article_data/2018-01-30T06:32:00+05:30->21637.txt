KOLKATA: China has stepped up support to insurgent groups in the northeastern states after the   standoff and India can expect an escalation in violence there, Lt Gen (retd) J R  , vice-president (operations), Centre for East and North East Regional Studies, Kolkata, said on Monday.

 The remarks came during the curtain raiser to a two-day deliberation on resolving contentious issues between India and China in Kolkata from Friday.
 
 According to Lt Gen Mukherjee, People’s Liberation Army continues to maintain a presence in the Doklam plateau. “China doesn’t want India to grow and turn into a competitor for valuable resources. PLA’s plan was to outflank Indian troops in the Doklam tri-junction. They have similar plans in Walong and Tawang. India has no option but to thwart such efforts,” he said, adding that CENERS-K’s recommendations had been treated very seriously and implemented by the Centre in the past.
 
 CENERS-K director (research) Harsh   said events like the seminar would help develop mutual understanding. However, he rued the fact that few researchers in India take up China as a subject — a situation reciprocated by China.
