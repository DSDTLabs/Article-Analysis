PUNE: Over 12,000 residents of   gaothan, who have been voting in Sant Ghadge Maharaj school next door and a few other schools in their close vicinity for decades, found their booths scattered to new places at least 2-3km away.

 Election staff and volunteers told them though their names were in the voters’ list they would have to travel to schools in Lullanagar and   to vote. The Shiv Sena, which has a stronghold here, blamed the BJP for scattering the voters. Its leaders said the confusion may benefit NCP which is trying to expand in Kondhwa. 
 
 Sena leader and former MLA Mahadev Babar said, “The delay in releasing the voters’ list led to a last-minute scramble to find the right booths. My wife and I cast our votes in Mount Carmel high school in Lullanagar, but my son had to vote in a school in Meethanagar. Similarly, many residents from our area had to visit booths away from the nearby ones they have been to exercise their franchise for all these years.” He said angry voters had to be pacified and were provided with vehicles with help from NGOs.
 
 Resident Nitin Chaudhari said voters were confused by the election staff who were inadequately trained. “Many people were allowed to vote without identity proofs while those with a voter’s slip and identity card were told to bring their Aadhaar card or a ration card and a driving licence,” he said.
