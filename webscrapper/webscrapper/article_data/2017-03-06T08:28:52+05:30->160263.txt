VADODARA: Staff and students of the Department of Painting of M S University’s famed Faculty of Fine Arts will organise a show in recognition of contributions made by veteran artist, Padma Shri and   awardee Gulammohammed Sheikh.

 The department will organise the show titled ‘Gulammohammed Sheikh: 80 years’ – from collections in Baroda at the exhibition hall of the faculty to celebrate Sheikh’s 80th birthday and also to mark his association with the faculty. The show will open on March 7 and continue till March 11.
 
 “There are artists who lead the history and there are artists who become part of it. Sheikh sir belongs to the former. His contribution as an artist, art historian, poet and educationist is immense,” said  , head of the department.
 
 Sheikh, who was a student of the department between 1955 and 1961, had started teaching art history while he was still a post graduate student.
 
 “His paintings which anchored in humanist ethos explored new possibilities by looking at the traditions and narrative structure in a new context,” he said.
 
 “He has been an inspirational teacher for generations of students who studied under him both at the art history department (between 1960 and 1963 and later between 1967 and 1981) and painting department where he was professor and head between 1982 and 1993,” added Vasudevan.
 
 Several of his works will be displayed at the show after decades. The show will exhibit works from his personal collection and also those procured from private collectors.
