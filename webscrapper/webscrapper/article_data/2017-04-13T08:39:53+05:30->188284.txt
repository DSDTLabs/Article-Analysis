MUMBAI: Less than a fortnight after the   order banning liquor   within 500 metres of national and state highways, the MMRDA led by chief minister   on Wednesday wrote to the state public works department asking it to denotify the western and eastern express   (WEH & EEH) so that closure of 340-odd   shops, permit rooms and bars in Mumbai and its immediate suburbs would not be required. WEH extends up to Dahisar, while EEH goes up to Thane.

 A high-ranking bureaucrat confirmed to TOI that MMRDA commissioner U P S Madan had written to the PWD saying roads on both highways should be   as the agency would be undertaking massive expansion work on the two stretches.
 
 Quite a few states denotified their national and state highways immediately after the SC order. In Maharashtra, four municipal corporations passed resolutions for taking over the state highways passing through those cities. 
 
 There are 25,500 liquor shops, permit rooms and bars in the state, 16,350 of them on national and state highways. 
 
 It is estimated that following the closure of the shops, the loss of revenue to the state will be Rs 7,000 crore.
