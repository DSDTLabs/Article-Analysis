TRICHY: Stating that criminal cases pending for more than five years have to be disposed of with utmost expedition, chief justice of the Madras high court   insisted on rendering quality justice to the litigants.

 Speaking at a function ‘Kudos to our mentors’ organised by the   to honour advocates who are in the profession for 50 years, the chief justice said, “It is important that the cases are disposed of expeditiously. As far as the high court is concerned, we do not insist on speed alone. We insist on quality. Our aim is to deliver quality justice. We can discharge the constitutional obligation to the people of the country.”
 
 On the role of advocates in the best judgments, justice Banerjee said, “Justice delivery is certainly not a one way process. Judges are not alone responsible. Lawyers have very important roles. Some of the best judgments come because of the assistance of the members of the bar. The junior lawyers should always be ready. Please keep yourselves up to date.” 
 
 The chief justice also advised the judges to award the judgments clearly. “We always tell our judicial officers that the judges speak through the judgment. Only through judgment, the litigants, appeal courts and others know what prompted that judgment.” 
 
 Justice Banerjee and high court judges M Govindaraj and Dr   honoured the senior most advocates and past presidents of the bar. Prior to that, she inaugurated the renovated library in the district court campus. Principal district judge,   also .
