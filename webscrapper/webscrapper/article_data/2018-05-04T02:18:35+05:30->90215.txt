NEW DELHI: A 24-year-old man was arrested on Thursday in connection with the double murder of   Sandeep Mental and his aide Pawan Ponny in southwest Delhi’s Bamnoli village. The murder turned out to be the fallout of a  .

 DCP (Dwarka) Shibesh Singh said that a team led by ACP Dwarka Rajinder Singh arrested Arjun alias Monu. The main accused, Rajeev, along with his two aides Akshay and Mani, is   absconding.
 
 The four men had trailed Mental’s car as he was travelling towards Dwarka court and fired indiscriminately and fled. The motorcycle was recovered from Pochanpur on Wednesday evening.
 
 A raiding team led by SI Naveen Kumar found that Arjun was coming to Dwarka to collect some money in the Santro car that was used in the crime. He was nabbed from there and confessed his involvement in the case.
 
 Arjun told police that the murder was hatched by Rajeev from Isapur village in outer Delhi, who had built eight flats in Pochanpur village in partnership with Mental.
 
 “Rajeev is a former aide of Naveen Khati gang but befriended Mental as they jointly built the property. However, Mental later said that he will take six of the eight flats following which the deal turned sour. Both were threatening to kill each other for the past one month,” an officer said, adding that the accused then roped in three more members to eliminate Mental before he could kill them.
 
 Arjun was taken as the main driver of the car as he is involved in liquor smuggling. Akshay, who is from the same village as Rajeev, also joined along with Mani. All four have past criminal records with Rajeev being booked in around two murder cases.
 
 While Mani was given the responsibility of conducting a recce around the target, Akshay was responsible for the logistics. Cops suspect the involvement of more people in the incident.
