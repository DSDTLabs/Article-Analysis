Panaji: Death is said to be the great equalizer but for nearly 100 bodies at Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital’s  , even death has not brought parity. The unclaimed, unmourned and unnamed, they are the forgotten, unwanted even in death. Whether victims of crimes or claimed by illness, for want of a relative these bodies remained frigid at GMC’s morgue, some for as long as three years, while authorities pointed fingers at each other and shrugged their shoulders.

 The Corporation of the City of Panaji ( ) has now stepped in to ensure that these bodies rest in peace. 
 
 “The   deserve dignity and we are giving them a respectful cremation. We don’t know about their religion so we do the best that we can,” CCP commissioner Dipak Dessai said.
 
 GMC officials said that more than 70 bodies are lying unclaimed.
 
  “Most unclaimed bodies have been lying in the morgue for three years. The police have to give an NoC for disposal of the body,” a doctor at GMC said.
 
 According to procedure, when a patient dies at a hospital and the relatives do not come forward, GMC is supposed to write to the police to contact the relatives. Police attempt to reach out to relatives at the address given and if no relative is found, the police write to the relevant district collector seeking permission to cremate or bury the body.
 
 “If you want to take the body to the native place, it is expensive, you need a vehicle and need to make arrangements for the burial. Some people cannot afford this or maybe the body is unidentified so the relatives cannot be contacted,” Dessai said.
 
 Considered of no value, most of these bodies did not evoke obituaries, save for the stray mention in a local newspapers about an unidentified body found by the police.
 
 “Many of them are labourers whose relatives may not know that they were working in Goa,” a police official said.
