 When Iccha tries to stop Makraant from spinning an evil spell on those around him, he retaliates by throwing another web on Ichha’s mother Sipli (Anjali Gupta). The latter is shocked when Iccha asks for more time instead of choosing to rescue her mother over Pehelwans. At the Pehelwan residence, Khadak (Badrul Islam) signs his last paper and Babble (Mishkat Verma) tears the papers and throws them away. Ichha tries to convince Sipli, but in vain. When Babble meets Ichha, he asks her about where she was when all the separation drama was happening at Pehelwans. He finds her excuse lame and chucks her out of his room. Ichha breaks down in front of Vaaku (Sanatan Bajaj) about being caught in the crossfire between Makraant and Babble.
 
 Says Priyal, “Ichha is in a dilemma about whom to save from Makraant’s evil plans. She tries to find solace in Babble, but he shoos her away angrily. This track is interesting and memorable because it also marks 
 the completion of our 100th episode.”
