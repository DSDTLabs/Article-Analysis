GAYA: Altogether 52 of 53 wards of the   Municipal Corporation will go to polls on Sunday. Tabassum  , wife of alleged gangster and jail bird Ibrar Ahmad alias   was elected unopposed following the withdrawal of nomination by two other contestants from ward number 25.

 The gangster himself is a candidate from the neighbouring ward number 26. Earlier, Bhola was elected unopposed from ward number 25 in the last election. This year, ward number 25 has been reserved for women, prompting the gangster to field his wife in this ward and shift himself to the neighbouring ward.
 
 Altogether 492 contestants are in the fray for 52 seats. Women contestants outnumber men. As against the 221 men contesting the municipal election, the number of women contestants is 271. That most of the women candidates are virtually doing proxy for their husbands or sons is another story.
 
 Meanwhile, voters from some areas of the municipal corporation on Friday protested against the last minute change in polling stations. The irate residents of   area of the town alleged that the booths were changed to favour a particular candidate.
 
 Denying the allegation of foul play in booth selection, district magistrate   said the changes were made in a transparent and fair manner with proper disposal of objections. “The booths were changed in accordance with the guidelines issued by the State Election Commission. Everybody wants his booth to be located next door. As per the guidelines, the booth has to be located within the geographical boundary of the ward and voters need not walk more than 2km. All the polling stations are located within the 2km range,” the DM added.
 
 The municipal area has been divided into nine zones and more than 100 magistrates will be deputed on mobile duty on the polling day. Nearly 2,000 cops have been deployed to ensure peaceful election.
