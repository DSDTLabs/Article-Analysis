NEW DELHI:   is universally considered to be among the most morally and physically reprehensible crimes in society and an   on the body, mind, privacy and fabric of the victim. Making these observations, a Delhi court sent a man from West Bengal to three years’ imprisonment after convicting him on charges of rape, assault and trafficking two women to Delhi.

 “Their dignity is shredded. The social stigma attached is such that many-a-times a crime would go unreported by the survivor,” observed special fast-track court judge Sanjiv Jain.
 
 Moinuddin Sardar (40) and Rafiq were accused of bringing the survivors from West Bengal to Delhi in 2014, raping them and forcing them into prostitution. As Rafiq remained on the run, he was declared a proclaimed offender.
 
 While one of the survivors had been promised a job, the other one had been brought on the pretext of marriage. The prosecution argued that the two survivors had been forced to consume alcohol and beaten up for refusing it before being raped.
 
 Moinuddin denied the charges and stated that he had been falsely implicated in the case. The court, however, observed there was common intention to sexually exploit the survivors by forcing them into prostitution. The court noted the “consistent” testimonies given by the victims under Section 164 of CrPC.
 
 Besides the jail term for rape, Moinuddin was also sentenced to lesser terms for assault and trafficking.
