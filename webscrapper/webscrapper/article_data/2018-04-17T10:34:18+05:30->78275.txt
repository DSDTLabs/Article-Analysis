GUWAHATI: People across the state were engaged in the   festivities during the past two days, but the festival was marred by a number of cases of road accidents and assaults across the state.

 Driving under the influence of alcohol was the prime reason behind the high number of road accidents occurring during the festival.

 In   ( ) district the emergency service received 10 cases of road accidents each on April 14 and 15. However, it received only one case of physical assault each on these two days. 
 
 "We have received a number of cases of road accidents from different parts of the state during the two days of Rongali Bihu festivities. Most of the accidents occurred because of people driving vehicles under the influence of alcohol. Our paramedical staffs engaged in the rescue work shifted the injured after administering them with the required first aid treatment to the nearest government hospital, " said authorities of the GVK EMRI 108 Emergency Service.
 
 On the other hand, there also occur many accident cases where the public do not contact the emergency service and instead take the injured to the nearest hospital. In such instances these cases go unreported. 
 
 "The number of cases of physical assaults also tend to be high during festivities. Usually people get excited and get into arguments and brawls on the slightest pretext leading to injury. In such cases we contact the police, who also reach the scene and take necessary action, " said an official of the service.
