CHANDIGARH: For delays in replying the Punjab and   high court in a case in which a petitioner failed to avail state quota to apply for postgraduation at   and Hospital, Sector 32, the court on Tuesday directed her to recover Rs 25,000 from the director general health services (DGHS). The DGHS is the designated authority for the NEET PG 2018 counselling. 

 Recently, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the high court, which had struck down the institutional quota of   32 for postgraduate courses in medicine and science (MD/MS) from 100% to 25%. 
 
 This implies that GMCH would now have to allow 25% quota to an eligible Chandigarh domicile MBBS students and 25% to the MBBS pass outs of medical college. The remaining quota is for the central pool.
 
 The petitioner, Dr Nanki Bakshi, is an MBBS from Pune but had done most of her schooling from Chandigarh. "She had applied under the state quota, but she was considered ineligible. She then applied under all-India quota. There was a notification on May 3 by the Government of India, which mentioned that the students, who took part under all-India quota will be considered ineligible for the state quota. We challenged this verdict," said the advocate of the petitioner, Aalok Jagga.
