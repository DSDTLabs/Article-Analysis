AMRITSAR: Actor and Mathura MP Hema Malini sought votes for BJP assembly candidates and Amritsar Lok Sabha byelection nominee Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhiina on Tuesday.

 Hema, who is famous for her character ‘Basanti’ in the movie ‘Sholay’, had on earlier occasions sought votes for Navjot Singh Sidhu, when he had contested on the BJP ticket from Amritsar Lok Sabha seat. However, this time, she was Sidhu’s rival, picking all the faults in his new party, the Congress.
 
 She took part in a roadshow in an area where Sidhu is contesting the assembly poll from Congress ticket. While highlighting the SAD-BJP government’s achievements, she canvassed in favour of Chhina and assembly candidates Anil Joshi, Rajesh Honey, Rakesh Gill and Tarun Chugh. The crowd cheered her all the way, as she sought support from the people for votes for the SAD-BJP candidates as Punjab goes to polls on February 4.
 
 The huge crowd greeted her with slogans of ‘Hema Malini Zindabad’ and ‘Jo Bole So Nihal Sat Sri Akal’ in Amritsar East assembly constituency, where she reached in the evening and sought voters’ support for party candidates.
 
 Hema enthralled the gathering with her famous ‘Sholay’ dialogue “Aaj teri Basanti ki izzat ka sawal hai”. At many places, people were just happy to catch a glimpse of her. She showered praises on the SAD-BJP alliance government’s achievements in the past ten years, saying that economic growth, peace and tranquillity had been the benchmark of the Badal government. “This government has achieved big by initiating all-round development. Give us another chance to carry on development works,” she said, adding that with the Modi government at the Centre and Badal in Punjab, the state could reach new heights.
