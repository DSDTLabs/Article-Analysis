NEW DELHI:   president   Monday alleged that Prime Minister   was the “Big Boss” spying on Indians, dubbing NaMo app as the medium to secretly monitor their conversations and movements. He even raised concerns over   cadets being forced to download the mobile application.

 
 A day after alleging that Modi was turning over data from his app to American companies, Rahul asked why should the government run a private NaMo app to “build a personal database with data on millions of Indians”.
 
 “Use the official PMO App for (communication with citizens). This data belongs to India, not Modi,” he fired as first of two tweets that escalated the ongoing clash between   and Congress over data leak.
 
 Rahul added, “Modi’s NaMo App secretly records audio, video, contacts of your friends and family, and even tracks your location via GPS. He’s the Big Boss who likes to spy on Indians. Now, he wants data on our children. 13 lakh NCC cadets are being forced to download the App.”
 
 Supplementing its chief’s aggression, Congress called Modi government a “data leak sarkar” and asked what was the purpose behind collecting data on 22 parameters from subscribers of NaMo app, noting it was higher than the 14 parameters on which details are sought by the official government app.
 
 AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said the lust for data in saffron camp should be seen in conjunction with the Centre’s stance in   against the “right to privacy”.
 
 He claimed the PM had moved to spying even on minors, pointing to Modi asking children in “exam warriors” to download his app. Singhvi asked why should the PMO seek contact details from 13 lakh NCC cadets in the name of “giving directions”. “As if there has not been communication with NCC all these years,” the spokesman said.
