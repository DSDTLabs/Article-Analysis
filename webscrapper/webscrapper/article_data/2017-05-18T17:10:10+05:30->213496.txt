MOTIHARI: The two-lane   from  , which has been under construction for the last seven years, has developed big ditches at half a dozen places on the 15km-long stretch between Ramgarhwa (Raxaul) and Motihari, resulting in frequent vehicle breakdowns, accidents and traffic jam. 

 The condition has become worse due to poor earth filling and heavy rain in the last few days. East Champaran district has been experiencing heavy rainfall for the last four days and the road has converted into virtual pond. 
 
 Police sources said 11 loaded trucks and four SUVs skidded off and fell into the roadside ditches during this period. Some trucks developed snag and disrupted traffic for hours. Loaded trucks for Nepal are stranded at several places between Motihari and Sugauli for days together, said a source.
 
 A trader said several requests have been sent to Union minister for road transport and highways Nitish Gadkari in the last few months to intervene and ensure completion of the road before monsoon. “This road is the lifeline for Nepal and we will be also badly affected if the movement of vehicles is affected,” said the trader. 
 
 Furious over poor progress of work on the important highway despite assurance of chief general manager of   (NHAI) Atul Kumar last year that it would be completed by March this year, local BJP MP Sanjay   said he would be forced to protest with his supporters. “The NHAI officer last year said if work in not completed, the contract will be terminated and new company shall be engaged, but we are in mid May and the work completion does not seem possible before the monsoon. We will now have to protest,” he said, adding the work of estimated Rs357 crore was to be initially completed in 2014.
 
 “The work started in 2011 and was to be completed in three years, but six years have passed and we are still waiting,” Jaiswal said.
