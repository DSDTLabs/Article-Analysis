JAIPUR: JDA will remove the Tonk Road barricading put up for construction of underpass in front of   by February 15. 

 For seamless connectivity between Sawai Man Singh Hospital and its   (ITO), situated opposite to SMS Hospital on Tonk Road, JDA is constructing a 24-metre long underpass.
 
 Since few months, JDA has blocked the road.
 
 For smooth movement of vehicles, traffic near Suchna Kendra has been diverted towards SMS Medical College and vehicles have to pass through Trimurti Circle to get connected with Tonk Road at Narayan Singh Circle. 
 
 Though the work is slightly affected due to ban on sand mining, JDA is confident of completing the work on time.
 
 “The work is in progress and it will take another 15 days for clearing the barricades on Tonk Road,” said a senior JDA official. 
 
 However, SMS Hospital is also looking forward to completion of the project on time. “JDA officials have told us that they will hand over the underpass to SMS Medical College by June end,” said Dr S S Yadav, spokesperson, SMS Hospital. 
 
 At present, since there is no connectivity through underpass or overbridge, patients have to be shifted from ITO to SMS Hospital main building through ambulances. “Once the construction is done, patients will be shifted from underpass only without any hassle,” said Dr Yadav. The passageway is designed in such a way that stretchers can pass through easily. As of now, the underpass is needed as Tonk Road remains quite busy all the time and shifting patients by ambulances takes time.
