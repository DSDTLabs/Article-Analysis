Nagpur: Since the hue and cry about missing names in state and general elections of 2014, there seems to have been an urgency among voters and administration to get names included or corrected and to update the electoral list. The results are showing as Nagpur district has emerged at number three position in the state in terms of inclusion of names and is at number four for number of forms received for inclusion, corrections or deletion. The summary revision of voters list takes place twice a year. “After the elections in 2014, we had received more than 50,000 forms for corrections, deletion, change of address and inclusion of names,” informs Malak Virani Tehsildar (elections). “Over last three years, we have been able to add 3 lakh names to the voter’s list in the district,” says Malak and adds that this could be done despite severe shortage of manpower. Around 1 lakh forms were received each year in 2015 and 2016. During the two drives for inclusion of names and corrections conducted in 2017, 45,000 forms were received in July and August and between October 3 and December 15, 75,366 were received of which 54,618 were for inclusion of names. “The data entry of these forms ended on December 31 and the list will be ready by January 12 which will be available online and a hard copy will be available with the 12 Electoral Registration Offices six being in the city and other six in rural areas. The hard copy of the list will also be shown to various national political parties,” Malak says. On National Voter’s Day, which will be observed on January 25, celebrations will be held at various booths, ER centres and Collector’s office. “We will be inviting those who have turned 18 in 2017-18 and will be voting for the first time in 2019, to give them their voter’s card. This year, the focus of election commission is on millennium voters and those with physical handicaps,” Malak says. The voter’s card is in colours of the national flag and bears the full address and date of birth of the voter. “The election commission works out a gap deficit in every district on basis of population of the district and the number of names on the electoral rolls. For Nagpur, there was a gap of 1,61,000 in 2015. By the end of 2016, the gap had come down to 1,26,000 and now after the summary revision in October-December, 2017 it is only 60,000,” says dy collector (elections) BS Ghuge. The total number of voters in Nagpur district in 2014 were 36,57,015. By end of 2017, the number rose to 38,42,582 and is expected to cross the 40 lakh mark by end of 2018 says Ghuge. For those who have still not enrolled themselves, another opportunity will be provided in 2018 as the final date for completing the electoral list is January 1, 2019. “They can fill forms online or at our offices and whenever the EC opens its website for enrolment, the names shall be added,” says Ghuge.
