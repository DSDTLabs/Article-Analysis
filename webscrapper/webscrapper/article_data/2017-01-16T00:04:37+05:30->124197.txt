   minces no words when he confesses that having done films in most south-Indian languages, he was someone who was stuck with the old-school belief that he wouldn’t ever do  .
 “But it all changed when I met the team of my TV debut  . It was through them that I realised the kind of impact that TV has today. As an actor, you strive to get that kind of reach through films, and TV has it all,” he says.
  Having been in films for over a decade and done projects including prominent films like Notebook in Malayalam, Charulatha and U-turn in  , Skanda is a thorough-bred actor. “I’m looking forward to the day when my debut Radha Ramana rolls out and, it soon will. I play a rich businessman in it and his sister means the world to him. It’s been a fun ride because my character was introduced to the audience through another serial Agnisakshi; it was a teaser to tell the audience what my character will be like,” he smiles. Having enjoyed the luxury of shooting one or two scenes in a day as a movie actor, the hectic pace of TV serials was a little hard to cope in the beginning, he confesses. “But I’m easing into it now. Yes, I’m still getting used to the long working hours and constant night shifts. But yeah, it’s a different ball game and I am someone who never says never,” states Skanda.
  The road ahead looks great, he tells us. And as an artiste, Skanda states, “I will go wherever interesting work takes me.”
