VISAKHAPATNAM:   to generate awareness on 100 per cent literacy and   are undertaking a 70-day road trip from   to mark the 70th year of Indian independence.

 The ladies will be travelling 24,000 kilometres across 24 countries driving Made-in-India  . On Wednesday, the fourth day of their drive from Coimbatore, the group expedition was flagged off from Waltair Club. They plan to reach London on June 5.
 
 What binds the three   members is their passion for travelling. Meenakshi Aravind (45), Priya Rajpal (55), and Mookambika Rathinam (38) met on a social networking site around eight months ago. While Priya is from Mumbai and associated with the advertising industry, the other two ladies from Coimbatore are associated with the textile and spinning industry.
 
 “We discovered our common interest in travel and exploring the world and added to it was the wish to take up a cause during our travel. So as Rotarians, we decided to spread awareness on the Rotary India Literacy Mission and Women Empowerment,” said Meenakshi.
 
 “We have planned our itinerary and the places that we will cross through. We are looking forward to travelling through beautiful and scenic terrains and drive through Manipur, Myanmar, China, Kyrgzstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Serbia, Germany, France, Netherlands and finally reach United Kingdom,” added Meenakshi, who had earlier gone on a road trip to Thailand.
 
 Considering the safety aspects, the group will not drive after sunset and stay in hotels instead of camping outdoors. 
 
 “We will also document our travels through photographs and videos and upload them on social media,” Priya said.
