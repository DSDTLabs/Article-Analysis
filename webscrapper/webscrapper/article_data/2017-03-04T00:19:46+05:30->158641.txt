NAVI MUMBAI:   officials   a 6-storey   building in   on Friday without police protection, as per its prior schedule. The drive was peaceful, said sources.

 “We had asked for protection and police agreed but when our team reached the spot, we learnt that protection was not extended for reasons best known to the police department. We had to summon our own security staff to continue the drive,” said Manoharan Menon, officer of special duty in CUC.
 
 Last month, Cidco had to cut short its demolition of the same building due to lack of adequate police protection. 
 
 The building had come up on 350 sq m Cidco plot in sector 4A near railway track. The developer, Nitin Mhatre, was served notices more than once before the building was brought down.
 
 Cidco had demolished the same structure when it was under construction in 2012 after serving due notices under MRTP Act 1966. 
 
 “An FIR was also lodged against Mhatre on June 18, 2012. However, he breached the notice terms and continued the construction,” said Menon.
