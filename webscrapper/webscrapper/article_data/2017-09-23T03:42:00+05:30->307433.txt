Panaji: Paving the way for setting up of startup, electronic manufacturing clusters and call centres in the state, the government notified the Goa Information Technology Development (Amendment) Act, 2017. The amendment defines the meaning of a startup, which will help eligible startups to apply for incentives, under the recently released Goa startup policy 2017. “Startup means an entity, incorporated in Goa not prior to seven years, and in case of biotechnology startups, not prior to 10 years, and with an annual turnover not exceeding Rs 25 crore in the preceding financial year,” the notification issued in the government gazette said.
