Trichy: Around 180 shops and a few private properties were evicted by the Tamil Nadu highways department at Thuvarankurichi near Manapparai on Wednesday from the land for the proposed highways which they had encroached on. 

 According to the department officials, the eviction process, which was conducted on the Trichy - Chidambaram highway, was intimated a week ago to the local residents and shop proprietors. This had given them enough time to dismantle their properties from the land that fell under the marked boundary of the state highways. 
 
 A senior official from the highway department claimed that the eviction was done only to a minimal extent within the town as it was only a year ago that a similar exercise was carried out in the same area. Another official stated that a number of local residents cleared from their places themselves after the early intimation and only a handful of small buildings within the town had to be removed. 
 
 Most of the evicted properties were shops on the highway and as many as four JCBs were used for the purpose. 
 
 Apart from highway department officials, Manapparai deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Asaithambi, Marungapuri tahsildar Kannan, Ponnampatti executive officer Shahul Hameed and revenue divisional officer Ponramar were present during the eviction process.
