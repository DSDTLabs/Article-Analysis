NEW DELHI:   is betting on non-Jatav Dalits in UP, fielding people from such communities in a majority of assembly seats reserved for scheduled castes even though Jatavs account for more than half of Dalit population in the state.
 
  Jatav community, to which   leader   belongs, constitutes about 55% of Dalit population in UP according to 2011 census, but BJP is fielding Jatav candidates in only 21 seats out of 85 such constituencies. It has set aside 49 seats for other Dalit communities such as Paswan, Dhobi, Kori, Balmiki, and Khatik.
  
  BJP leaders said the party was betting big on Paswans that constitutes about 15% of Dalit population in the state. The party has fielded 24 Paswan candidates on reserved seats.
  
  BJP has also fielded 10 Dhobi candidates, seven Khatiks, five Koris and three Balmiki candidates.
  
  Remaining reserved seats have been given to smaller Dalit castes in the state. Party leaders said the reason for this social distribution of reserved constituencies stems from their assessment that ex-CM Mayawati commands fierce loyalty among Jatavs.
  
  BJP has been claiming that it managed to break into BSPâ€™s core Dalit support base during 2014 LS elections. However, the party assesses that a lot of Dalits who voted for BJP then may return to BSP for the assembly election.
