NEW DELHI: There was pandemonium in the Rajya Sabha on Friday with   MP   alleging that   youth wing leaders had threatened him over his remarks on Hindu gods earlier in the House.

 The opposition also vociferously protested against the broadcast and publication of the expunged remarks, prompting Chairman Hamid Ansari to declare that show cause notices would be sent to media houses which reported the comments.
 
 Agrawal had made the remarks two days ago during a discussion on lynchings. “I have heard this morning’s proceedings. I have received a notice from some members raising a question of privilege against a TV channel and some newspapers for making defamatory remarks against a member of this House,” Ansari said.
 
 Agrawal alleged that members of BJP’s youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha had attacked and vandalised his Delhi house while a ruling party worker filed an FIR against him in Meerut in connection with these remarks. The SP MP said if a member is threatened for speaking in the House, it is disrespect of the MPs as well as that of the House.
