KOLHAPUR: As mercury levels touched a maximum   of 39 degrees celsius on Sunday, most of the city’s roads wore a deserted look the whole day. Festival shoppers ventured out of their homes only after 5pm on Sunday.

 The minimum temperature stood at 24 degrees celsius on the same day. This was above normal by 4 degrees celsius, while the maximum temperature was one degree celsius above normal.
 
 According to the regional meteorological centre Mumbai, no major change in maximum temperatures was seen across the region. However, they were above normal over north Konkan, central Maharashtra, Marathwada, Gujarat and Kutch regions. Elsewhere the temperature was normal.
 
 The forecast stated read that the maximum temperature may continue to hover above 40 degrees celsius at a few places over central Maharashtra and Marathwada over the next few days. A rise in the maximum temperature by 1 or 2 degrees will be recorded over   regions over the next 2-3 days.
 
 Mahesh Kulkarni, a citizen from the Rajarampuri area, said the temperature has risen considerably over the last few years. “Considering the present status, it seems that May might cross the maximum temperature by over 42 degrees in the city, which was never the case in case of Kolhapur maximum temperature,” he said.
 
 “Caps, hats, water bottles and other such precautionary measures have been made compulsory to our kids. Dehydration is a major cause of worry for us as parents during this kind of hot weather,” he added.
 
  a street vendor of caps and the sunglasses said sales have been soaring this year with the rise in temperature.
