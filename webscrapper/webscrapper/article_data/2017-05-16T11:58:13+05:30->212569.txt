HYDERABAD: The   turned into a battleground on Monday morning after thousands of protesters, opposing the state's move to shift the site out of the city, clashed with a group of people supporting the government's decision. Over 5,000 agitators who thronged the venue indulged in vandalism forcing the police to resort to lathicharge. 

 The Hyderabad police later registered four criminal cases against the   (DCPS) members, including   chairman,   and Left parties. Cases were registered for unlawful assembly, promoting enmity and assaulting government officials on duty. "We registered cases only against DCPS since they resorted to violence besides holding the meeting without any formal application to the police," said V  , deputy commissioner of police (Central Zone). 
 
 From as early as 9 am, the popular protest site was teeming with crowds. This, after commissioner of police M Mahendar Reddy clarified that for one day cops would permit protests at Dharna Chowk and not arrest anyone for joining in. Led by the   (TJAC), people took out rallies and raised slogans against the TRS government's proposal. The deployment of over 1,000 police personnel, barricades and riot control vehicles failed to deter the protesters. 
 
 But within hours, the stir took a violent turn when an altercation broke out between the two rival groups. Protesters hurled chairs, sticks and rods at each other resulting in a mayhem at the venue. As many as 10 protesters were injured in the clash, with some of them suffering minor head injuries.
