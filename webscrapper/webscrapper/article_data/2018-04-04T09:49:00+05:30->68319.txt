MADURAI: As the discontent is brewing over the government’s failure to set up   Management Board (CMB), ministers, AIADMK cadres and public staged sit-ins while   downed shutters expressing solidarity with the cause across the city on Tuesday. Some people protesting against the situation even blocked a train in the city before being arrested by police.

 Ministers   and R B Udayakumar led the stir in the North masi Street, West Masi street junction where a grand pandal was set up. Addressing the agitators, Sellur Raju said that the government would strive to protect the rights of the Tamil people.
 
 “The DMK has done a great injustice to the people in issues like the Mullai Periyar and Cauvery. They did not act when they had been a part in the central government. They were play-acting now to win the favour of the people,” he said.
 
 Udayakumar said that Centre’s move to buy three more months to form the CMB was positive, but promised to put pressure on the government to constitute the board at the earliest. He acknowledged that AIADMK has ruled the state for 27 years and was instrumental in implementing many schemes beneficial to the people.
 
 As traders expressed solidarity with protestors, the central market dealing in tonnes of vegetables every day sported a deserted look. Small shops like tea vendors too remained shut in many places. However, supermarkets functioned normally with some operated with shutters partially down.
 
 Over 100 persons, including former MLA Murugavel Rajan, were arrested as they stopped the Nagercoil- Mumbai Express for about 45 minutes on the  .
 
 Lawyers staged a protest in front of the Madurai district court demanding that the CMB be constituted immediately. Led by local MLAs of the respective regions, protest were taken out in Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar. Over 800 fireworks industries in Sivakasi stopped work expressing solidarity with the protestors.
