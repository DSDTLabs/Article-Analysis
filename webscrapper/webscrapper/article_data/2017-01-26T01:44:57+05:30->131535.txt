MUMBAI: Even as the Sharad Pawar-led   has ruled out the possibility of an alliance with the Congress,   observer and former Haryana chief minister   on Wednesday asked   president   to make a fresh attempt for the alliance to halt a split in secular votes.

 “I had a prolonged meeting with Mumbai Congress leaders and heard their views on an alliance with the NCP. A section of the party leaders were in favour of the tie-up,” Hooda told TOI. “After I return to Delhi, I will brief the high command on their views and we will examine the possibility of an alliance with like-minded parties.” 
 
 After a marathon meeting with former MPs, legislators, corporators, office-bearers of the Mumbai Congress, he said he was ‘happy’ with the party’s preparedness for the BMC elections.
 
 Hooda’s visit to Mumbai had assumed political importance in the wake of a banner of revolt raised by former Mumbai Congress president  . 
 
 Hooda said he has asked the warring Congress leaders—Kamat and Nirupam—to resolve their differences and fight the BMC polls unitedly. “We have set the target of dislodging the Shiv Sena from the BMC. I am sure Congress activists will give a tough fight to gain control over the BMC.”
 
 Kamat had stated that following his remarks against Nirupam’s style of functioning, the AICC had deputed Hooda to take stock of the situation. Significantly, the AICC had asked Hooda to visit Mumbai on January 20. “Kamat did not attend today’s meeting. I was told that he is in Rajasthan for the Congress agitation against demonetisation,” Hooda said.
 
 Meanwhile, former Union minister Milind Deora, who had earlier tweeted that leaders should work unitedly for the party and the people failing which the party must pull them up, had a “good meeting” with Hooda. On Wednesday, he tweeted that he was happy the party intends to discipline habitual saboteurs and agitators.
