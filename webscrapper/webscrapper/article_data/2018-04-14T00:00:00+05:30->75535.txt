 You know how every time people say you need to go out there and vote to make a difference, if anyone thinks that it’s just one voice, it’s just one vote and that it doesn’t matter, they’re wrong . It does matter, especially in today’s times; every single person needs to go out and vote. On an individual level too, you need to do your homework. You need to see which party and which candidate it is that you want to vote for.
 
 I would like to see the process of being able to vote — right from enrolling to finding your booth and casting your vote — be simplified. It should be so simple that you have no choice but to vote. An average person who works 10-12 hours a day has a lot of pressure and stress already. Something like this should not add onto the already existing pressure. It needs to be something that a person is proud of doing. Right now, there are too many stumbling blocks from enrolling to getting your voters ID; all of this is very hard. I wish there was more information out there and that it was easier to find that information. I cannot stress enough on the fact that it’s your voice, it’s your vote. The biggest threat to any democracy is an uninformed electorate. We need to be more informed with the right kind of information.
 
 People should not be swayed by peer pressure and what is being bombarded at them. Your vote is very personal and important. Whichever party you vote for should hold your ideals and that’s very important. I would also like to add that civics must be made compulsory in schools. Learning about the Constitution and your society is extremely important.
