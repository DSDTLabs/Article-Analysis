MEERUT: At a time when applicants have frequently complained about late arrival and theft of   via post, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been signed between the Uttar Pradesh   (RTO) and India Post for delivery of all motor  , including driving licenses (DL), registration certificates (RC) and  , through registered or speed posts only. 
 
 There was a rule earlier of sending DLs through registered or speed posts but the order was not strictly enforced. With the MoU in place now, no document can be handed over to an applicant by hand.
  
   , RTO (Meerut), said, “An MoU has been signed with the India Post under which all documents that are issued by the RTO office – including driving license, RCs and fitness certificates – will be sent to people only via post.”
  
  “Applicants will have to submit an envelope with their addresses duly written on it along with a postal stamp,” said Ranjeet Singh, additional regional transport officer (administration).
  
  It should be noted that this initiative, which was rolled out on May 1, will stand contradictory to Vaahan 4.0, the centralised registration system, set to be introduced in the district and which will enable people to take print out of RCs from their homes.
  
  According to the MoU, India Post authorities will send a concerned person to the RTO office every day to collect documents that are to be delivered. However, no India Post official has come to the RTO office till date, despite 344 documents ready to be delivered. RTO authorities said they had to instead send the documents in the hands of one of their persons to the India Post office.
