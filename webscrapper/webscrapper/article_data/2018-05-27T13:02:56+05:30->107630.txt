Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s literary works have always been a hot favourite for Indian filmmakers. His novels have been adapted to screen in all major Indian language. ‘Devdas’ is also not an exception. The iconic fictional character has been enacted by some of the finest actors of Indian cinema including Dilip Kumar, Soumitra Chatterjee and Shah Rukh Khan.

  
 Now it’s time for   to join the elite list. The only difference is that Jisshu will be seen as the apparition of Devdas called ‘Das Da’. Prosenjit Chatterjee has taken the initiative to produce this quirky, supernatural rom-com ‘Das Da’. No further details about the cast have been revealed yet. If all goes according to plan, the shoot starts by the end of 2018.
 
 
  
 It will be quite interesting to see how Jisshu pulls off such a challenging role. He is right now quite busy promoting Srijit Mukherji’s next ‘Uma’ which is releasing on June 1. This film will mark his daughter Sara Sengupta’s debut in Bengali cinema. Jisshu is also playing the titular character in Srijit’s upcoming ‘Ej Je Chilo Raja’. He has another film in the pipeline, Soumik Sen’s ‘Mahalaya’.
