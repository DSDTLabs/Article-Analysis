HYDERABAD: A major reason for the delays in repairs and restoration of roads torn apart for various cabling and pipeline laying works is the absence of any master plan for laying cables and pipelines.

 Once dug up, the multitude of cables and pipelines, that too at different depths, make the work difficult. Not only do contractors struggle to find the exact cable, often in the process they end up damaging a water pipeline, electricity cable or sewerage pipeline.
 
 “While doing some cable-laying work at Subhashnagar a couple of months back, the contractor accidentally damaged the sewerage pipeline. After a day , sewerage water was overflowing on the road,“ said Murali Krishna, who made an online complaint to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB).
 
 The repair of the damaged cable or pipeline then requires another couple of days and the involvement of one more agency. “Usually both the contractors undertaking these works try to pass the buck when it comes to taking responsibility . Some of the stretches that have been repeatedly dug up by different agencies in fact do not even have the dug-up part covered.The   at   is one example,“ said a senior   official.
 
 The Ayyappa society road is another example of road cutting and digging work being taken up three to four times over the last one year, said locals.“Initially , the manholes were opened up and refitted after some work by the   following which a small stretch was dug up for cabling work by TSTransco. Now, the Hyderabad metro rail authorities have put up barricades and dug up the road,“ said P Sainath, a shopkeeper in the area.
