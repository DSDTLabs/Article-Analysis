SHIMLA: While hearing a matter related to water shortage in the state, the   high court has directed the assistant solicitor general of India to file status report of schemes pending with the Union government. The officer shall also apprise this court of schemes which are pending with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) and has posted the matter for June 12 for further hearing.

 A division bench of acting Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Ajay Mohan Goel in their order on Friday observed that in the meanwhile Union of India will also ensure that steps are taken to provide funds required for the augmentation of water schemes, proposals regarding which have already been sent by the state to the Centre. 
 
 The court in its order pointed out that Himachal Pradesh is blessed with many perennial rivers like Satluj, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, Pabbar, Chandra and   among others and 90% of the state’s population lives in rural areas. It said that even after more than 70 years of independence not even 50% of 53,604 habitations identified by the irrigation and public health department have been provided adequate potable water. 
 
 “It cannot be said that per se there is paucity of water in the state. However, perhaps, paucity of will to provide adequate potable water to the residents of the state is there as far as administration is concerned,” it added.
 
 While referring to the affidavit filed by the engineer-in-chief, irrigation and public health department, on May 16, the court said that it is evidently clear that at least with respect to three districts of Hamirpur, Kangra and  , the situation with regard to supply of potable drinking water to the habitations is highly inadequate as not even 50% of such habitations are fully covered as per the norms of the state. The position with regard to other districts is also not very happy, it added.
