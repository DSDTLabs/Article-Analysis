KOLHAPUR: The civic administration has decided not to withdraw the show-cause notices issued to traders for non-payment of the local body tax (LBT), in the time span of 2011-15.

 Representatives of over 18 traders’ organisations from the city met the LBT officials on Monday to demand the withdrawal of the notices. 
 
 The   (KMC) has issued notices to over 20,000 traders for not submitting the documents of transactions during 2011-15, which are required to assess the tax evaded by them. 
 
 The civic administration has appointed a panel of six chartered accountants to assess the LBT. 
 
  of   organisation said, “We have scrutinised the notices issued to the traders and found that 500 of the notices are illegal. As per the law it is mandatory for the civic body to give 15 days for the traders to reply to the notices, but no such time has been stated. Most traders have submitted the documents to avail of concession benefits through the   and are ready to submit it again.”
 
 Since August 2015, the state government abolished the LBT for the traders with transactions less than Rs 50 crore annually. 
 
 The government launched the scheme to ensure that the traders pay the dues. Traders claim though that the KMC has increased the tax rates for certain items and asked them to pay the dues according to the increased tax rates. 
 
 LBT officer of the civic administration,   said, “The notices issued are a reminder, therefore are legally valid. Also, many have paid the tax on the basis of the earlier octroi rates and not the rates specified by the government while initiating the LBT system. We have told the traders to meet the municipal commissioner to discuss the issues related with the rate. Transaction documents like sales tax bills, excise bills or self-assessment documents must be submitted for clear assessment.”
