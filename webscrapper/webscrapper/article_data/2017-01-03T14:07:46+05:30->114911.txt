NAGPUR: Year 2016 would certainly prove to be a forgettable year for the Tayade family of Geetanagar. After having seen their only son behind bars in  , the Tayade couple was fighting their own legal battles and allegations by the deceased daughter-in-law’s kin. As if this was not enough, the family lost valuables worth more Rs 2.17 lakh in  , all in 2016.

 Retired superintendent of Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Sheshrao Tayade and his wife Anjali felt relaxed when their son Amit tied the knot with Khusboo in January 2015. Later, Amit and Khusboo shifted to Bengaluru to pursue their career in software engineering. The Tayades were jolted by Khusboo’s suicide on August 21 last year at Bengaluru. Amit was arrested, his parents and sister were also booked for dowry death. Sheshrao, Anjali and their daughter, however, secured bail from the high court.
 
 The family was fighting the odds and trying to help Amit legally and for that they had shifted to Bengaluru for the time being. The Tayades received another shock on October 9 when unidentified burglars managed to flee with valuables from their residence in the city, despite the presence of a watchman. The burglars fled with 78 gms of gold, a camera, gas regulator and clothes too. 
 
 The actual loss came to light when the family returned to the city on Sunday. Though the matter was reported to the police in October, the police could not ascertain as to what had been stolen.
 
 Watchman Vasudeo Mohankar, who was entrusted with the responsibility to guard the place, said that the burglary had taken place between 6.30 pm and 11 pm on October 9. “It was Navratri time when there was much noise around which may have drowned the sound of breaking locks,” he said.
 
 An offence has been registered at Hudkeshwar police station following Sheshrao’s complaint. He has also lodged a complaint against a kin of Khusboo who had been threatening and abusing them.
