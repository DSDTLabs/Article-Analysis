Sandeep Aanand, last seen in 'May I Come In Madam?', was looking forward to his next show, ' ', which was expected to go on floors in a month’s time. However, we now hear that he has opted out of it. He says, “It’s a very good show, but I feel I won’t have much to do in it. So, as an actor who craves to do a bit more than what’s expected of him, I wouldn’t have been able to satisfy myself with what was in store for my character. I opted out on an amicable note."

 The actor, who has featured in popular shows like ' ' and 'FIR', which starred   in the lead role, was roped in to play a struggling actor in the new comedy show. The show, which boasts of an interesting storyline, features   as the male lead’s mother. It will also feature actress   and actor Dayashankar Pandey in pivotal roles.
