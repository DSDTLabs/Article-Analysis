Visakhapatnam: The age-old practice of providing shelter to only native breed cattle offered to Lord Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy at Simhachalam temple is posing a problem from many owners of non-native breed cattle. Middlemen take advantage of this restriction and sell the non-native cattle in slaughter houses. Simhachalam temple executive officer K Ramachandra Mohan said, “We accept only seven varieties of native cattle and inform the devotees not to offer non-native cattle to the God through the media. But people still come to offer non-native cattle. Some NGOs rescue these non-native cattle.” Mohan further said they were currently giving shelter to nearly 180 native-breed cattle. “We will keep a tab on unauthorised transportation of abandoned cattle in the temple premises and have invited volunteers to keep the animals safe rescued by the temple,” he said, adding that people who do not have any use of the animals usually come to the temple and offer them to the God. J Pradeep Kumar Nath, founder president of Visakha Society for Protection and Care of Animals (VSPCA), said they rescue abandoned cattle at Simhachalam temple. “We give some of the male cattle to farmers in the Agency. We lodge police complaints if any one is found illegally selling the cattle for slaughtering purposes.”
