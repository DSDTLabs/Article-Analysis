AHMEDABAD: Nostalgia was evident in the atmosphere at   gallery, as a group of 60-odd students of the 1977-78 batch of   – faculty of fine arts – organized a reunion over an exhibition of their works. The group exhibition of paintings, drawings, textile art and photographs was inaugurated by renowned artist   and NID director Pradyumna Vyas.

 “We curated this exhibition earlier this year in January in Vadodara, soon after the death of one of our teachers. Many of our batchmates put together their works and that is how the exhibition was organized in Vadodara. The response was so good that we decided to take it to Ahmedabad and other cities too. Nine months later, this was made possible,” said  , a faculty member at faculty of fine arts, MS University, Vadodara, who is also an alumnus of 1977-78 batch.
 
  
  While the earlier exhibition was organized to commemorate the veteran faculty member, the one in Ahmedabad was more of a reunion. Most of the works, including paper on ink, line drawings, collage, textile art and acrylic on paper paintings, were not recent creations meant specifically for the exhibition. “It was more important for the batchmates to get together. We hope to take it to other cities of India as well,” said Anil Relia, a city-based art entrepreneur, who is also an alumnus of the batch.
