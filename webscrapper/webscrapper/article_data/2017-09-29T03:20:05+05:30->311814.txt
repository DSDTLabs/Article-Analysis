Mumbai: Work on the crucial fifth and sixth lines of   (WR) has ground to a halt since February due to protests from locals in   over the issue of access to a Muslim cemetery. WR had commissioned the fifth line between Borivli and Santacruz in 2002 and between Mumbai Central and Mahim in 1993. But it was not able to lay the fifth line between Mahim and Santacruz due to paucity of land. The sixth line is being constructed between Borivli and Mumbai Central. 

 Hence, WR is constructing a   to replace the existing Harbour corridor bridge that takes trains on the elevated path from Bandra to Khar. After commissioning of this bridge, the existing bridge will be razed to create space for the two lines.
 
 WR general manager Anil Kumar Gupta said, “Work has come to a standstill on this patch. This will affect timeline of the project.” WR had planned to complete work by 2021. 
 
 Adjoining the tracks is the masjid and two cemeteries—one managed by the Bombay and Bandra Bakar Kasai Jamat and another for the Dawoodi Bohra community. There is also a BMC-run crematorium. Currently, people use an unauthorized road to access the cemetery. Once the bridge is completed, the unauthorized pedestrian route will close down as the ramp for bridge will begin from this end. Irfan Pawar, trustee of Bandra Bakar Kasai Jamat said, “WR has left space under the bridge, a few metres ahead of the main gate of the cemetery, for people to walk. But, we are demanding access in front of our gate.”
