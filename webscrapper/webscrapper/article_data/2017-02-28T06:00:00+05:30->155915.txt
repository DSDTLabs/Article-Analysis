HOWRAH: A 35-year-old   was   in front of her   (aged six and three-and-a-half) on Sunday evening in Howrah’s Bally. Rakhi Singh, wife of a tea merchant, was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where she succumbed to her injuries. None has been arrested so far. 

 Police suspect that Singh knew her attackers and had thus opened the door to them. When she went to the kitchen to get tea for the visitors, one of them stabbed her in the neck.
 
 Neighbours rushed to the scene on being alerted by her screams, which forced the miscreants to flee. Singh’s elder daughter has named one of the assailants. Cops have also collected CCTV footage from the cameras installed inside the apartment complex. 
 
 “The couple had recently bought gold jewellery for a wedding. Though the motive of the attack is not known as yet, it seems the men attacked her for the valuables,” said an officer. — Rupak Banerjee
