Bhopal: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan dug toilet pits to flag off ‘Swachhta Hee Seva’ campaign in the state at Raisen district on Sunday.

 CM, his ministerial colleagues, MPs and MLAs celebrated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday by offering shramdaan. Praising the PM, Chouhan said, “The cleanliness campaign started by PM Modi has become a campaign that is directly linked with the common people.” 
 
 The chief minister’s morning began with flagging off Swachhta Rath — which will create door-to-door awareness about cleanliness and need for constructing toilets at home.
 
 He then reached Ratnapur village near Sanchi-Raisen road to dig pits. The campaign has been initiated to make the villages clean, said Chouhan. A target to dig 2 lakh pits for toilets was set for Sunday. Chouhan also said that Raisen district will be declared open defecation free by November 19.
 
 “Some people might say that he is a CM and he is digging pits for toilet, but it is been done to promote Swachh Bharat campaign,” said Chouhan at Surajpur village of Chhattarpur district, where he dug pits in the tribal dominate region later in the afternoon.
