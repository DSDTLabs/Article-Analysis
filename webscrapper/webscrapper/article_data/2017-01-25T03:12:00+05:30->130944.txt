PANAJI: The   (AAP), with its star campaigners in the state, got a rude shock on Monday when its own MLA from Delhi, currently suspended by the party on disciplinary grounds, counter-campaigned and leveled allegations of massive corruptions against the Delhi government. 

 Devinder Sehrawat, sitting MLA from the Bijwasan Constituency in  , on Monday, said that people in Goa were being fooled as the party had failed to deliver in the national capital. 
 
 “I spent one-and-a-half months in Punjab when I found out that women were being exploited in the name of being given a party ticket to contest the assembly elections,” Sehrawat said, adding that Delhi chief minister   is contributing nothing to the government. 
 
 Alleging that the Delhi government has failed to perform any credible development work in the last two years, Sehrawat, who also contested the   elections on the AAP ticket in 2014, said that the party has failed to ensure its own operational transparency. 
 
 “There are irregularities in the party donation lists, and for the past six months, the party has failed to show its own donor list on the website,” Sehrawat said. 
 
 The MLA said that the party was working on installing franchise in Goa and Punjab where the main control is exercised by the Delhi leadership. 
 
 “I will be releasing the documented evidence of corruption happening in Delhi for the people here to see, so that they can have a better judgment of AAP before casting their vote,” Sehrawat said.
