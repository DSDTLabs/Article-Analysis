KOLHAPUR: The civic body wants the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to allow an Ichalkaranji-based firm to treat the biomedical waste generated here. 

 The   (KMC) had two years ago terminated the contract of a Satara-based firm appointed for treating the biomedical waste. On the basis of a   ( ) order, the KMC has temporarily appointed the Ichalkaranji firm for treating the waste till it completes the tender process for appointing a new organisation. The firm has a treatment facility at Ichalkaranji and the MPCB is authorised to grant the permission.
 
 KMC chief sanitation inspector Vijay   said, “We have decided to set up a new processing unit at Kasba Bawda. Till then, the Ichalkaranji firm should get the permission to process the waste. We have approached the MPCB for its permission. Since the termination of the Satara firm, we have imposed a penalty of it s 44 lakh on its for not delivering proper service for the period when it was active. We have issued two notices and will serve the final one soon to recover the fine."
 
 The KMC has reserved an acre at Kasba Bawda to set up a treatment plant that will be equipped with modern incinerators to process around one tonne of biomedical waste daily. About 1 tonne of biomedical waste is generated through 550 odd clinical establishments. This includes wastre from hospitals, blood banks and and diagnostic laboratories. Complaints about biomedical waste being thrown in the open and also in garbage containers have been frequent in the last one year. 
 
 “We are making surprise visits to the hospitals where such practices have been observed. The NGT will hear a case on the biomedical waste March 17, during which we will urge the court to direct the MPCB to grant permission to the Ichalkaranji firm as early as possible,” Patil said.
 
 The KMC's proposed biomedical waste processing plant will be developed on an acre of land and will have the capacity to treat 10 tonnes of waste a day.
