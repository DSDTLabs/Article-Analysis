PANAJI: Bharatiya   ( ), an association of persons for primary education in the mother tongue, on Wednesday, demanded assurances from the government that it would strengthen education in the mother tongue.

 The BBSM held a meeting in the city on Wednesday wherein senior leaders expressed concern how the education sector is being neglected.
 
 Subhash Velingkar, convener of BBSM, told TOI “it is not just the present government which doesn’t give education a priority. It wasn’t any different when the Congress-led government was in power”.
 
 Velingkar, who had lashed out at chief minister   in the run-up to the assembly polls, said education is one of the many portfolios held by Parrikar. “When you are the chief minister, it is but natural you will be the busiest person and will not able to devote quality time to the education ministry,” Velingkar said.
 
 “Various assurances given to us in 2012 are yet to be fulfilled,”he said. BBSM submitted a memorandum to Parrikar including a demand to stop grants to English medium primary schools, in phases.
