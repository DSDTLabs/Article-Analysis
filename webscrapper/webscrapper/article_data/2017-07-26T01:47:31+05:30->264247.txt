MUMBAI: Passport authorities must not follow a standard format to reject police clearance certificate (PCC) applications, but consider individual cases, the Bombay HC said on Tuesday.

 The court heard a petition by a  , a project manager in an IT major, urging it to direct the Regional Passport Office (RPO) to grant him PCC so that he can secure H-1B   to travel to the US. In May, his office had applied for the visa to send him for six weeks in Illinois. In June, he applied online for a PCC, but at the RPO, he was told a court order is required for them to issue it. The petitioner said he has only one pending case that of dowry and domestic violence filed by his Pune-based wife who lived with him for only two days after their wedding in May 2013. His office has postponed the US visit until he gets the visa.
 
 His advocate Shriram Kulkarni argued before a bench of Justices Ranjit More and Sarang Kotwal that if he is not issued the visa, it would affect his career. He said his client has earlier taken permission from the trial court and travelled abroad. “Police clearance was not required then, but for H-1B visa, it is required,” he added.
 
 Advocate Sandesh Patil, appearing for RPO, said it received an ‘adverse report’ from the police saying the case is still pending in a Pune magistrate’s court. He said a form is prescribed to an annexure in the passport manual which says if there is an adverse report, PCC cannot be issued. The judges asked if a standard format is applied for granting PCC and said the passport authorities must consider every case independently. “You must be receiving so many cases. The facts will be different. At this rate, no one will be able to travel abroad,” said Justice More. —Rosy Sequeira
