COIMBATORE: Nine stray dogs were found dead near a farmland at Poonga Nagar in Coimbatore on Tuesday. Animal rights activists filed a police complaint and said postmortem should be conducted.

 At 7am on Tuesday morning, P M Yasmin who was on a routine morning walk was shocked to find nine dogs lying dead near her field. She informed other residents and alerted the animal activists. 
 
 “All these dogs had become like a part of the family. All of us fed these dogs and brought them up for the past seven years. Only one dog is alive now,” she said. 
 
 K Durga Sri, another resident of the area, said someone had poisoned the dogs by feeding them meat and they suspected some field workers in the area. 
 
 “None of us had any problem with these dogs. We are shocked and saddened by this,” she said.
 
 Durga said a lady named Shantha living in the area had brought a stray puppy from her hometown seven year ago. It grew up in the area and gave birth to several puppies. “We had been raising them as our own for the past seven years,” she said.
 
 The residents registered a complaint with the Podanur police. Kalpana Vasudevan of People for Animals Unit II said they would conduct the postmortem of the dogs. 
 
 “We suspect that someone from the nearby field must have poisoned the dogs as they had started entering these fields in the recent past. The area has more than 500 houses and all seemed to love these dogs. They were all very disappointed and we want to help them. We will find the culprit soon in the next couple of days,” said Kalpana. She added that while most areas poisoned stray dogs, she was touched by the love that the residents showed for these dogs.
