GURUGRAM: An air monitoring machine will be installed in   in Civil Lines for around 10 days in an attempt to measure pollution levels in the vicinity.

 “This is the first time that an air quality monitoring machine will be installed on the hospital premises. The hospital is surrounded by traffic most times. There is also a major commercial hub — Sadar Bazaar — and a bus stand close to the hospital. As many patients visit the hospital’s pulmonology department, it is important for us to know if the air here is severely polluted. Pregnant women and newborns also visit the hospital, and air pollution monitoring will help us take adequate steps to minimise exposure of particulate matter,” said a senior doctor, requesting anonymity.
 
 The monitoring machine will be installed to measure the levels of PM2.5, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The data of pollutants from the machine will be analysed after 10 days of installation.
 
 More than 400 pregnant women visit the   in a week, and over 20 deliveries take place there daily. The pulmonology department, on the other hand, receives about 50 patients a day. The machine will be installed near ambulance control centre, and will be functioning 24x7 for 10 days.
