Tirupur: The state government has directed the Water and Power Consultancy Services (Wapcos) to put on hold its work of preparing environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the Avinashi-Athikadavu ground water recharge scheme.

 The government gave the direction as the public works department (Water Resources Organisation) modified its plan of the project to establish underground pipelines instead of open canal.
 
 A senior official in the public works department (plan and designs division) told TOI, “Earlier, the department planned to build open water canals from Pillur dam for the project. But to reduce the cost, the plan was changed to pump water from Kalingarayan canal of the Bhavani river and supply it through underground pipelines.” To get clearance from the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) for the project, the state government had asked Wapcos, a consultancy functioning under the Union ministry of water resources, to prepare the EIA report in December 2016, for which it was paid an advance of Rs 16.3 lakh from the state government sanctioned Rs 3.27 crore for the project. 
 
 “As now the plan was changed, Wapcos was directed to put the preparation of the EIA report on hold a few days ago,” said the PWD official.
 
 The official also mentioned that the department has prepared a new detailed project report (DPR) with an estimate of Rs 1,850 crore, instead of Rs 3,500 crore in the original plan.
 
 “We have sent the DPR to the state government two months ago, and the government is yet to approve it. We would decide on the Wapcos’ role based on the government’s response,” said the official.
