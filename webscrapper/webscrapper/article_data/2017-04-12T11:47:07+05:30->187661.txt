Her artworks have been constantly been fetching praise on social media where she updates her followers regularly on her creations. But recently, even   was pleasantly surprised when she received an invitation to exhibit her work at an event that celebrated a noble cause — that of mental health. 

  On the occasion of World Health Day,   Centre for Philosophy and Humanities held a talk on depression, its various facets and ways to recovery. An art exhibition and storytelling was also part of this mega programme. 
 
  “And my   and   were prominently displayed for the past few days. I feel honoured,” shares Samyukta, who was approached by the authorities who felt her work was in tandem with their theme. Most of the pictures were clicked during her recent trip to Varanasi, comprising lonely dogs, a lone bicycle and random people. “My doodles had people staring into space. The people behind this event felt that my work conveyed a sense of loneliness, hence they became part of their workshop,” she explains, adding, “An artist always wants to be of service to the society, whatever medium be it. I am glad I was able to be of some help. This was a prestigious event on my roster,” sums up Samyukta, who is also associated with PETA.
