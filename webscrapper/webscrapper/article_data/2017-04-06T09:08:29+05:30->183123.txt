BHIWANDI: Bajrang Dal workers accompanied by a police team raided a slaughterhouse in Bhiwandi and seized 300kg meat suspected to be of beef, 250 animal skins and rescued 34 animals, including cows and bullocks.

 Bajrang Dal workers claimed that the slaughterhouse operated without a licence. The police have arrested seven people, including the owner Haji Nawab and the slaughterhouse’s employees. The police said rescued animals have been sent to a cow shelter in Angaon and the meat is being tested in a forensic laboratory. “We have learnt that Nawab would bring these animals from Nashik,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 An FIR under the   Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, which bans slaughter of bulls and bullocks has been registered. Under the legislation, cow slaughter attracts a five-year jail term and Rs 10,000 fine and possession of meat of bull or bullock leads to one-year jail and Rs 2,000 fine. 
 
 Last month, Gujarat passed a law, which raises the maximum jail sentence from three to seven years to 14 years–equivalent of a life sentence–for cow slaughter.
