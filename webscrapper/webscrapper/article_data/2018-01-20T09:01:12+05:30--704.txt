CHENNAI: The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a special leave petition by   ( ) against a Madras high court judgment which allowed   to declare 22,979.19 hectares in Tirunelveli, including the BBTC-administered Manjolai estates, a reserved forest.

 A week after the TN forest department declared the area in Ambasamudram taluk a reserved forest, bringing it under the   (KMTR), the firm moved the   saying the high court had not properly appreciated its case. A senior forest official said it was a long drawn battle between the state and BBTC, to which the land has been leased for 99 years. The battle began in 1978 when the forest department wanted to declare the area a reserved forest under Section 4 of the TN Forest Act 1882 (Intention of the government to declare the area as reserved forest). The chief conservator of forests and field director of KMTR told TOI the company wanted patta for the core area of the Manjolai estate, and so filed cases in various courts and dragged the issue for more than four decades, preventing the entire area from being declared a reserved forest.
 
 When the case came up in the Madras high court last September, it finally issued an order to declare the area a reserved forest. BBTC wanted to get a patta and claimed it had become owner of the land, but the plea was rejected by the court, which said the company could remain in the place till the lease expires in 2028. This despite the area being declared a reserved forest, including the more than 8,000 hectares of the Manjolai estate. Adding this land to the tiger reserve will help maintain contiguity of the area. An order in this regard was issued by TN on January 12.
 
  The KMTR is the first wildlife sanctuary in the country and the Tamil Naduâ€™s first tiger reserve .
