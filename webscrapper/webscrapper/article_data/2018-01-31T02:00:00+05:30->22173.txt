PATNA: Police are planning to take Vicky Paswan and three other suspects in Raunak   case to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) at Gandhinagar in Gujarat for narco-analysis and other tests.

 Raunak (14), son of property dealer Sudhir Kumar, was kidnapped for Rs 25 lakh ransom on January 17 and his body was recovered from a shop owned by Vicky the same day.
 
 Six different tests – layered voice, brain electrical and oscillating signature, brain fingerprinting, narco-analysis, polygraph and psychometric – are likely to be conducted on prime accused Vicky and three other suspects – former Fatuha RJD MLA Om Prakash Paswan’s son Parsuram Paswan, contractor Jairam Kumar and SIM card seller Mohd Tahseen alias Bittu. The tests will be conducted in the presence of psychiatrists. Serums are injected in human body in some of these tests.
 
 However, according to a Supreme Court’s ruling of 2010, these tests could not be conducted on any person without his or her consent. Accordingly, the police are awaiting the nod of the three suspects for their tests.
 
 “Once the suspects give their nod, police will move court seeking permission for conducting the tests at CFSL in Gandhinagar,” city SP (east) Vishal Sharma said.
 
 Police have already collected the fingerprints of five persons, including Vicky, following a court order. The SP said the special investigation team (SIT) formed by Patna zonal IG Nayyar Hasnain Khan to probe the case would submit its report soon. The SIT was formed after Raunak’s family members, who met CM Nitish Kumar, told him that they were not satisfied with the police claim that only Vicky was involved in the murder.
