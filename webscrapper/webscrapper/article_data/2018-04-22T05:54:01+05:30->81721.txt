KOLKATA: Sanjay  , a 35-year-old builder who also traded in construction materials, was shot dead after being chased down by four armed men on two bikes at Panihati’s Harishchandra Battal More in   on Saturday morning. The murder took place barely 300m from his home.

 The   police inspecting the case suspect the murder was a fallout of a rivalry between Singh and his one-time business partner Mukesh Shaw.   had also been attacked a couple of months ago but survived gunshots. Singh might have had engineered the attack on Shaw, who went on to take revenge and bump off Shaw, the police said. Singh’s family alleged Shaw hired killers to murder him.
 
 Like every day, Singh, a resident of Khardah’s Chandra Dutta Road Sitala Mandir, had gone for a morning walk around 5:30am-6am on Saturday. Four armed miscreants, wearing masks and riding on two bikes, started following Singh, the police said. On realizing the four were tailing him, Singh started to run and the bikers, too, picked up pace behind him. The chase on   station road continued for a few minutes till the bikers blocked Singh’s way and surrounded him. The accused got off the motocycles and stood in a circle around Singh; two of them took out pistols and pumped five bullets into Singh, the police said.
 
 As Singh collapsed to the ground, the accused rode away. Alarmed by the gunshots, residents of the area rushed to the spot. Someone alerted his family, who also came running to where Singh lay. A profusely bleeding Singh was taken to Balaram State General Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Singh’s body has been sent for post-mortem.
 
 The police are now on the lookout for Singh’s business partner, Shaw, after his family, comprising his parents and three sisters, alleged he had hired killers to bump off Singh. Locals also said there was a constant rivalry and tussle among local developers and building material suppliers over grabbing projects.
