ERODE: In a sign of simmering discontent over  's ascension to the party's top post, a group of former   floated a new party in Erode on Sunday. 

 The party has been named   and the founders would appeal the late Amma's niece J Deepa to take over the new outfit's leadership. "We will approach her and ask her to lead us from the front," said Farook Ali, who resigned as AIADMK's Erode fisheries wing secretary a few days back. Former party district president of Amma Peravai, Gowri Shankar and its ex-joint secretary Kamal Batcha are other founder members of the new party. The duo had resigned their party posts along with Farook Ali. 
 
 "We have been strongly opposing Sasikala's elevation as the party general secretary, a post held by the late Amma. Our views were not taken seriously. Hence we quit AIADMK and formed the new party to serve as a platform for all disgruntled AIADMK cadres," Farook Ali said.
 
 But AIADMK leaders in the region brushed aside the new development as a publicity stunt. "All AIADMK functionaries are unanimous in the opinion that only Sasikala can keep the party intact and guide it. Deepa is a political novice and it is joke to say she will give an able leadership," said an AIADMK MLA from Coimbatore. 
 
 The founders of the new outfit said they would soon meet Deepa. The trio has also unveiled a flag and symbol for the new outfit. 
 
 While the symbol is two roses, the flag is similar to the AIADMK with the addition of portraits of MGR and   in its white strip.
