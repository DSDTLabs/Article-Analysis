PUNE: Nazare, a dam in the arid Saswad-Purandar region, recorded live water storage of 0.04 TMC on Sunday.This is significant because, of the 25 major dams in the   basin,   was the only dam that had failed to reach live water storage level due to subdued rainfall in its catchment. Thanks to recent rains, Nazare too has now received good inflows.

 A state irrigation department official said, "Nazare is a small dam located in the arid area of Saswad-Purandar, with maximum storage capacity of 0.75 TMC. The catchment areas of Nazare recorded heavy rains in the last few days, which has pushed the dam's storage up to 7%. Though the inflows have been less when compared to larger dams like Panshet and  , they still are significant. This additional stock would go a long way towards meeting water needs of about 54 villages in the drought-prone   and Purandar areas."
 
 In the last four years, Nazare's water stock had never touched the 100% mark. Last year, the stocks reached 40% mark. Water schemes of 19 villages in Baramati, and 35 villages in Purandar depend on Nazare's water.
 
 Meanwhile, water stocks in 18 of the 25 dams in the Bhima basin have reached the maximum storage capacities. Among the dams closer to the city , 1,712 cusecs of water was released from the   dam on Sunday. Water was also released from Panshet and Varasgaon to accommodate fresh inflows.The inflows had pushed collective storage in the dams up to 27.49 TMC (94.28%) on Sunday. Catchments of Varasgaon and Panshet recorded above 2,000 mm of rain in the season, while Temghar has so far received 2,996 mm of rain. Almost 676 mm of rain has been recorded in Khadakwasla's catchment.
