BIJNOR: The "actual story" about how the   began from  , where an alleged incident of   had  , retaliation and then  , has suddenly begun appearing on various social media platforms.
 
  Coming as it does as riots-ravaged Western UP goes to polls on February 11, many have brought the matter to the notice of the administration, which is yet to take any action on it.
  
  The "story", which is mostly being shared within Jat groups, mentions that the youths who were lynched and the girl who was "molested" were all members of the Jat community. It goes on to say that BJP was the only party which helped the community then as "no one stepped out in our favour". It says that the "supreme leader of Jats" also disappeared when Jats were most in need of his intervention. "Other parties did nothing either, Jats have only the BJP to be thankful for," it says.
  
  In Western UP, there is a tussle between BJP and Rashtriya Lok Dal of Ajit Singh to get the support of Jat voters. With many Jat groups now openly going against the BJP for not heeding their demand for quota when Haryana erupted in violence last year, the fight for this bloc has become more cut-throat. In some constituencies of Western UP, Jats account for as much as 30% of the population.
  
  Senior RLD leader Praveen Deshwal said, “Those trying to instigate (Jats) in an attempt to get political mileage should be punished.”
  
  MM Beg, the ASP here, said, “An inquiry will be set up in this regard. However, we have formed a team which is keeping a close watch on social media.”
