 According to the police, Sonu, a resident of Dhandiya village, and Sagar from Barvan village of Rajkot had eloped together on December 27, 2017. The duo had first met each other when Sagar started working as a farm labourer in a farm in Dhandiya village. Sonu used to stay in the farm next to where Sagar used to work.
 
 Since Sonu was married, the couple feared opposition from their family members and decided to end lives, the police said.
