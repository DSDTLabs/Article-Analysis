JAIPUR: Unidentified criminals beat up a jeweller near   area of the city late Friday night and looted jewellery and cash worth Rs 3 lakh from him. The victim was rushed to the hospital for treatment.

  (27), a jeweller, was returning to his house in   when some people began following his scooter. “They beat him up, threatened him with a knife and made away with cash and jewellery which Shivraj was carrying in a bag,” a police official told TOI.
 
 The victim reached Mahesh Nagar police station at midnight and narrated his ordeal. “The incident took place at around 11.30pm. It seems that the criminals were familiar with Shivraj’s routine as they knew about the route he would take,” the police said, adding that the criminals had hit the victim’s scooter from behind.
 
 A massive search operation was launched soon after the victim informed the control room about the incident. “Barricades have been set up at important locations and   footage will be examined to identify the criminal,” the official said.
 
 The cops searched several areas at night, but failed to make any breakthrough. The latest incident comes in the wake of a similar incident on Friday where people caught two criminals fleeing from Sodala after stealing a bag from a businessman which contained Rs 3 lakh.
 
 “We will check CCTV footage from nearby commercial institutions for information about the criminals. The entry and exit checkpoints of the city are under watch. So, those who carried out the attack on Shivraj will not be able to sneak out of city limits,” he said, adding that a FIR has been registered at Mahesh Nagar police station.
