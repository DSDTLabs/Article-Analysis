GURUGRAM: The 10-year-old girl, whose body was found in a cistern with a plastic rope tied around her neck, may have been sexually assaulted before being gagged to death, according to the autopsy report. Police, however, said it could be confirmed only after receiving the   (FSL) report. The autopsy report has confirmed that the killer had hit her throat with a sharp-edged weapon and tried to burn the body after strangling her.

 “The girl was strangled. A deep wound, which is inflicted with a sharp-edged weapon, is found on her neck. After killing her, the accused tried to burn the body to hide evidences. Some minor burns are found on her face. She may have been sexually assaulted, but that will be confirmed only by the FSL. We will send the samples to the lab,” said Dr Deepak Mathur, a forensic expert of Civil Hospital and one of the doctors who conducted the autopsy.
 
 The girl’s body was handed over to the family on Tuesday. The girl had gone missing on January 16 from a juggi near Tau Devi Lal Botanical Garden in Sector 52.
 
 Later, her father approached police and lodged a complaint, suspecting that his daughter may have been kidnapped. An FIR was lodged against unidentified accused at the Sushant lok police station under sections 363 (abduction), 366A (procreation of minor girl) of IPC, and a police team was formed to track her. On Monday evening, acting on a tip-off, police reached the Saraswati Kunj area, where the child’s body was found in a cistern near a tube well.
 
 “We formed a special team to investigate the case. We will take all necessary steps to nab the accused soon,” said inspector Gaurav Phogat, SHO, Sushant lok police station.
