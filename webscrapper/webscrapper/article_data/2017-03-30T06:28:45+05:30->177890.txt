PUNE: Social crusader   on Wednesday announced that he will start an agitation to protest against the Union government’s apathy to appoint a Lokpal even after three years of the BJP-led coalition coming to power.

 Addressing a news conference at his native place   in the afternoon, Hazare said he will announce the date of his agitation in a letter to Prime Minister   shortly. He said his decision to start the agitation has earlier been conveyed to Modi in a letter sent on Tuesday.
 
 Hazare said he does not accept the reason cited by the government that the committee to select a Lokpal could not be constituted because the post of leader of opposition is still vacant in the Lok Sabha.
 
 “Things have not changed in the last three years and the post remains vacant. However, if the new   chief can be appointed in the absence of the leader of opposition, why can’t the Lokpal be selected?” he wondered and said that the government does not appear serious about the Lokpal’s appointment.
 
 Hazare said even if one accepted that a Lokpal cannot be appointed in the absence of the leader of opposition, at least   could have been appointed in all states. The Union government said the appointment of Lokayuktas was the responsibility of the state governments.
 
 “But Lokayuktas have not been appointed even in states where the BJP is in power. It is difficult to accept that the BJP governments in the states have not followed the PM’s order, if such instructions have been issued,” Hazare stated.
 
 The Gandhian pointed out that the present government’s assurance to end corruption has not translated into reality and the common people still have to grease palms to get their work done.
