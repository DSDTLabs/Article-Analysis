CHENNAI: The   has sought transparency in the issue of tenders floated by PWD and other departments which are involved in construction of  . DMK working president   in a statement on Saturday hit out at the   government for tweaking the rules and allegedly allotting all tenders to its partymen. 

 Alleging that there was no transparency in the allotment of tenders, Stalin said the issue was raised by DMK during the January session of the assembly and the then government under O Panneerselvam promised action. 
 
 "There are several projects which are yet to commence and some of them are stuck for want of funds. Tenders for projects which have commenced are being granted only to AIADMK partymen without any transparency," said Stalin. 
 
 When DMK was in power, the then government passed an act in 1998 to bring about transparency in the allotment of bids. "It was only based on this act that the DMK government commenced the construction of the new secretariat, Hogenakkal drinking water and Ramanathapuram drinking water schemes and tenders were floated. But the current government gives scant respect to the act and allots all tenders to its partymen," alleged Stalin. 
 
 The leader of opposition also alleged that many ministers were involved in the allotment of tenders to their own men and due to this there have been news reports of in-fighting within AIADMK the projects. 
 
 "The government has not implemented online tender process for all departments, especially in PWD. Departments that follow online process have been introducing new rules like getting certificates only to favour the ruling partymen," said Stalin. 
 
 The DMK leader demanded that the government change its working culture in the interest of the state. "The government under   must ensure there is no corruption or fraud in the allocation of bids to contractors and thereby prevent any loss of revenue to the government," said Stalin.
