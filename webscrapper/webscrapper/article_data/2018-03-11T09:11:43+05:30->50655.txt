COIMBATORE: State minister for handlooms and textiles O S Manian on Saturday urged entrepreneurs to embrace technical textiles, saying it was the only way to take the domestic textiles industry forward, as the country had been facing stiff competition from China, Bangladesh and  .

 “Entrepreneurs looking to start textile ventures should opt for technical textiles rather than traditional textiles,” he said speaking at the inauguration of a two-day workshop on technical textiles at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel International School of Textiles and Management (SVPITM) in the city.
 
 Pointing out that the central government had made available several subsidies for entrepreneurs who take up textile ventures, K Phanindra Reddy, principal secretary to the department of handlooms, handicrafts, textiles and khadi, said, “By developing the textile industry, the gaps in gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income of the nation can be bridged.”
 
 The state government has recognised the Sardar Vallabhai Patel International School of Textiles and Management as a nodal centre for the development of technical textiles and sanctioned Rs 25 lakh to set up a technical textile wing, said a communication from the institution.
 
 The proposed wing would impart skills to textile entrepreneurs in the field of technical textiles and also provide solutions for the growth of technical textiles, the communication said.
 
 Municipal administration and rural development minister S P Velumani and deputy speaker of the state assembly Pollachi V Jayaraman were present at the function.
