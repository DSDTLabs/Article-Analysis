AHMEDABAD: Nearly 20,000   from the state will remain deprived from their statutory right to study in private schools as   government has continued to implement the Right to Education Act ( ) in phased manner.

 This year, the state government has made provision to admit 62,000 students in class I in private schools under the 25% free quota for the poor kids in private schools. There were 82,000 applications the education department received for admission under this scheme.
 
 In the last four academic years, only 21% of total eligible students from the poor strata of the society could get the benefit of the scheme. This is because RTE laws are not fully implemented in Gujarat.
 
 Around 4 lakh students got admission to class I in private schools every year. According to RTE, 25% i.e. 1 lakh students must be admitted to class 1, under RTE. However, against this, only 87,875 students have been admitted to class 1 in the past four years from 2013 to 2016. This makes merely 21.8% of the actual targeted admissions being done. Even for the upcoming academic year, the state education department has targeted 60,000 admissions, which is 60% of the actual target.
 
 Commenting on this, Sukhdev Patel, educationist, said, “Even though the RTE came into force in 2010, it was not implemented in the state with immediate effect. The basis of the targets for admissions decided by the government are questionable.”
 
 “Going by the government’s target of admitting 60,000 students under RTE this year, there would be 2.40 lakh students studying in class 1 in private schools. However, according to government figures itself, around 4 lakh students are admitted in class 1 in private schools every year. Out of this, 25% quota for RTE would make 1 lakh students,” he said, adding that the rule of law cannot be implemented in a phased manner.
