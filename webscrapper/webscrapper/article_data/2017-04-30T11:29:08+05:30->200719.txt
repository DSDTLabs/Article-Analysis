NAGPUR: Three years ago, before he became prime minister,   had visited Dabhadi village in Arni talukla of   district during the   election campaign and held a ‘chai-pe-charcha’ with farmers. Led by Congress leader  , protest rallies have been organized annually in that village to remind Modi of the promises that he failed to fulfil.

 “This time round we have decided to scale-up the protest. Farmers from Dabhadi village will stage a daylong fast and protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi. They will also invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a ‘chai-pe-charcha’ to remind him that promises he made three years ago remain to be met,” said Moghe.
 
 As per a tentative programme farmers from Dabhadi and nearby villages will start the protest march from Sewagram’s Gandhi Ashram and then proceed by train via Nagpur to Delhi on April 17. Modi had specifically told these farmers that if he came to power they would be paid minimum support price for crops as per MS   committee’s recommendation. 
 
 Modi has promised that farmers would be paid crop price adding 50% as profit over and above input costs. But currently the crop rates being paid do not even cover input costs. After Modi’s false promise, the suicide of farmers in and around Dabhadi has seen a rise,” Moghe told TOI.
 
 “Over a hundred farmers from Dabhadi and nearby villages will join the protest in Delhi where several top leaders of the Congress and farmers leaders of national level are expected to address them,” said Moghe. “They have waited in the hope that the electoral promise will be fulfilled. But now they see that Modi has only betrayed them by forgetting the much needed relief of adequate price for agriculture produce,” said Moghe.
