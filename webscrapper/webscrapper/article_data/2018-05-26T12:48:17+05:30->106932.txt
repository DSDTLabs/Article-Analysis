 Now Former Bigg Boss winner of Season 5,   has turned a new page with “Kannada Kogile”
 
 Chandan is now on the pursuit of finding some of the finest singing talents across the state. Through his stint in the Bigg Boss house,   has always been vocal about challenging the bar set on music in   and vehemently mentioned that talent when noticed, must be groomed. 
 
 With Chandan as the face of it and a panel of judges,   is the channel’s endeavour at doing just that
 
 Chandan Shetty is on a tour of 7 cities in a bid to find the choicest of voices that deserve a shot at being heard.
 Unlike conventional auditions, he will not be at the hot seat calling the shots on who makes the cut, but will be visiting the 7 cities to encourage innate talent and persuade people to follow their passion and dream big.
 
 The first course of “Kannada Kogile” will be a judge’s mass audition, where out of the chosen 40 auditioned contestants, the ones qualifying to the final cut will be picked. Going forward, the final contestants will be divided into groups mentored by the judges. 
 
 Renowned singers from the industry will be a part of the journey by imparting lessons in music and vocal training.
 
 Chandan Shetty’s first stop was at Belagavi. From there on he moved towards Hubli, followed by Davangere, Shimoga, Managalore and Mysore, thus making Bangalore his last stop.
 
 Scheduled for a launch in the later part of June, Kannada Kogile is yet another show which is making its way to the small screens to entertain Kannada TV fans.
