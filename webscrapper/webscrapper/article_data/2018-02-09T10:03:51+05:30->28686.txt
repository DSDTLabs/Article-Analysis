JAIPUR: The ruling party legislators continued to corner the   in the state assembly for the fourth day in a row on Thursday. In the latest,   MLA from Niwai (Tonk) Hira Lal Raigar alleged that the district police and the local education officers were shielding a school principal accused of molesting a Dalit girl student.

 
 
 
 
 Raigar questioned the role of district SP, who was accused of being indifferent in the matter. The BJP MLA informed the house that the Dalit family was being threatened and pressurised to withdraw the complaint. Demanding protection for the Dalits, the ruling party legislator sought reply from the state government. Home minister Gulab Chand Kataria was, however, not present in the house.
 
 The opposition members grabbed the issue and accused the government of being anti-Dalit. Congress whip Govind Singh Dotasra said, “A ruling party MLA is alleging that Dalits are being harassed. The government should be ashamed. The ruling party is saying there is no law and order in the state.” BSP MLA Manoj Nyangli said fake cases were being registered against Dalits. Dotasra referred to a police case registered in Sikar district.
 
 Amid the din created by the opposition members, parliamentary affairs minister   attempted to respond but Speaker   said the house’s scheduled business for the day would be taken up first. Raigar had raised the matter under ‘point of information’ provision at the start of zero hour. The MLA said the incident occurred at a village in Todaraisingh tehsil on January 30 and the matter was reported to the police on February 3.
