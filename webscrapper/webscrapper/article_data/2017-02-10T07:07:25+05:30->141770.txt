CHENNAI: A city-based   group on Thursday submitted a complaint to the TN   stating that   head VK   and her family members have encroached government land, including water bodies on the East Coast Road (ECR).

 The complaint was filed by Jayaram Venkatesan, co-convenor of the  , Arappor Iyakkam.
 
 “Government pond bearing survey number 406 in Siruthavur village, Thiruporur SRO, Kancheepurm has been encroached by Sasikala and her family by forging documents. Copy of the encumberance certificate (EC) which says the same survey number has been registered in the name of VN Sudhakaran, Sasikala’s nephew, has been attached with the complaint,” Jayaram said.
 
 Similarly, plots of land classified as ‘govt others’ in the government’s registration department website have been registered in the names of Sudhakaran and Sasikala’s sister-in-law Illavarasi as per EC, the complaint stated. “Clearly fake documents have been created and the government land encroached,” Jayaraman said.
 
 In their complaint, Arappor also raked up the issue of film personality Gangai Amaren’s complaint about his plot in Payanur village in Kancheepuram which was ‘forcefully’ taken away by Sasikala and her family. “This has been recorded in the Cunha judgement of the Disproportionate Assets (DA) case on the former CM J Jayalalithaa, Sasikala, Illavarasi and Sudhakaran,” Jayaram said.
 
 Arappor has requested the DGP to file an FIR and arrest Sasikala and her relatives and restore the land to original owners. They have also demanded that the police protection to Siruthavur bungalow is withdrawn as it ‘is a grabbed and encroached land.’
 
 AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP A Navaneethakrishnan told TOI he wouldn’t be able to comment without going through the allegations.
