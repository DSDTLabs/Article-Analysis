Colva:   panchas and members of the Carmona Villagers’ Social Welfare Forum on Wednesday conducted a joint inspection of the controversial construction site owned by a Mumbai-based company in the village. 

 The company was represented by their associate vice-president and liaison officer Kamal Khemani. 
 
 The members of the forum had complained about illegalities at the site and also filed a Public Interest Litigation in the high court. 
 
 Acting sarpanch Savita Mascarenhas said they are “satisfied” that the builder has adhered to the stop work notice ordered by the town and country planning department and panchayat office, and that the builders have promised to not carry out any activity till the case pending in the high court is disposed of. Mascarenhas said the panchayat will seek legal advice before deciding the future course of action.
 
 The inspection of the construction of three structures in the property was followed by a long discussion between the three parties. Forum president Socorro Miranda pointed out various anomalies regarding the issuance of the construction licence by the previous panchayat body without taking infrastructure aspects such as road, water and electricity into consideration. “PWD has said that they have received no proposal for expansion of the road from 3.5m to one required for this massive project, water department has no data about the quantity of water that will be required for the housing project, neither does the power supply have any indication of the requirements of this project,” Miranda said. 
 
 He also alleged that the previous panchayat body issued the licence for revised plan this year, while the code of conduct was in force.
 
 Khemani said that the company has respected the court order issued on July 14.
