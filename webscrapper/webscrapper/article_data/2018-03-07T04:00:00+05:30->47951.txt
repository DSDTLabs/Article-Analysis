Surat: The Rs25-crore beautification project of bridges in the city, conceptualized by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), will be implemented in two phases now.  Facilities for pedestrian safety and easing of traffic movement will be set up in the first phase while the second phase will involve beautifying the areas below the bridges. The expenses for the beautification project for the seven bridges in seven municipal zones made in 2017 will be spread over in two financial years.  Despite tenders having been issued and contractors invited to present ideas to beautify the bridges, austerity measures had forced the local body to curtail unnecessary spending in the immediate budget that was presented.  “A few days ago, all those who had filled the tenders were invited. They were informed about the decision to undertake setting up of facilities for pedestrian safety and easing of traffic movement in the first phase. The work of adornment below the bridges will be taken up in second phase,” said a civic officer from the bridges department. Parle Point flyover in Athwa zone, Star Bazaar flyover in Rander zone, Katargam main road flyover in Katargam zone, Varachha road flyover in Varachha zone, Surat Bardoli Road flyover in Limbayat, Udhna flyover in Udhna zone and Delhi Gate flyover in the central zone have been chosen for the beautification project.  “This is the first-of-its-kind experiment in the country. We will wait for feedback of citizens to evaluate the beautification project. If need be, rectification will be carried out in second phase of the project,” SMC city engineer Bharat Dalal said.  The tendering work for four of the seven bridges has been completed.
