Coimbatore: An autorickshaw driver was arrested on Sunday for thrashing a migrant labourer who turned down his demand to provide him Rs 15,000 to celebrate the Labour Day (May Day).

 The arrested was identified as R Ananth, 36, of Rajivgandhi Nagar at Vadavalli. According to police, he assaulted P Sanjaykumar, 28, a native of Uttar Pradesh. Settled at VNR Nagar at Vadavalli about 10 years ago, Sanjaykumar had been running a pushcart tiffin stall near Uzhavar Sandhai at Vadavalli.
 
 On Friday around 8.30pm, Ananth visited the tiffin stall and demanded Rs 15,000 from Sanjaykumar towards Labour Day collection. Ananth told him that preparations were on to celebrate the May Day in a grand manner at Vadavalli.
 
 But Sanjaykumar refused to provide the amount. In a fit of rage, Ananth assaulted Sanjaykumar and threatened him with dire consequences.
 
 Following this, Sanjaykumar lodged a complaint with the Vadavalli police. Special sub-inspector Ganeshamoorthy on Saturday registered a case against Ananth under Sections 294 (b), 323 and 506 (i) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him.
 
 Ananth was later produced before a judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody. He was subsequently lodged at the Coimbatore Central Prison.
