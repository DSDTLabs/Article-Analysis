PUNE: A 41-year-old   was deported on Friday for   to   from July.

 Police took Alih Christain Chidiebeve in custody from Mundhwa Road near ABC Farms on September 9 and recovered 10g of cocaine worth Rs 50,000 from him. “Since Chidiebeve is suspected to be a member of a gang involved in selling cocaine, Pune police commissioner Rashmi Shukla took a call to deport him since filing a case against him would have meant keeping him here for a considerable time period,” police said. 
 
 A team from Mundhwa police and foreigners’ registration office handed over the suspect to the immigration authorities at the Mumbai airport. He flew to Addis Ababa by an   flight at 5.35am on Friday and onward to Lagos in Nigeria.
 
 Chidiebeve visited India on a business visa in January this year, which expired in July. He initially stayed in Mumbai and then shifted to his friend’s residence in Kondhwa.
 
 Senior inspector Anil Patrudkar of the Mundhwa police said, “We had received information of a person selling cocaine near a paan stall on Mundhwa Road. We laid trap on three occasions, but failed to nab him. After considerable efforts, we finally took him in custody and recovered 10g of cocaine from him on September 9.”
 
 Patrudkar said, “Chidiebeve told us that he used to smuggle cocaine in small quantity to India in parcels for making quick bucks. He, however, avoided revealing name of his gang members.”
