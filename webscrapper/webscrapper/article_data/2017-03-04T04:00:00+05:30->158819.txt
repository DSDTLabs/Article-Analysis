Coimbatore: IHH Healthcare Berhad, the world’s second largest healthcare provider by market value, which owns Parkway Singapore, has sold about 6% stake in Apollo Hospitals Enterprise for Rs 1,070 crore ($160 million). IHH’s Mauritius arm sold around 84.4 lakh shares of Apollo in the price range of Rs 1,267-Rs 1,320 per share in bulk deals on Friday.

 Of the total, 39.26 lakh shares were bought by DB International Asia, Deutsche Bank’s arm, based in Singapore, at an average price of Rs 1,267 per share, aggregating Rs. 497.4 crore. Other buyers, including institutional, picked up stakes in small chunks. 
 
 Malaysia’s IHH is the second largest shareholder in Apollo, the country’s largest hospital chain, with a 10.85% stake. Nearly 1.3 crore shares of Apollo were traded on both the stock exchanges on Friday against a two-week average of over 2 lakh shares. The Apollo scrip declined 5.3% to close at Rs. 1246 on the BSE on Friday.
 
 IHH’s total stake in Apollo is valued at around Rs 1,900 crore (about $290 million) based on Friday’s closing price on Friday. The more than a decade old relationship between IHH and Apollo is ostensibly under strain after the former started investing in healthcare assets across the country. IHH had acquired Continental Hospitals and Global Hospitals for $282 million in 2015.
 
 “IHH had informed us of their intention to sell. Today we hear that they have offloaded nearly 6% through secondary market sales. While we are not aware who the buyers are, we believe that some FIIs and DIIs including MFs could have picked the shares up,” A Krishnan, chief financial officer, Apollo Hospitals told TOI.
