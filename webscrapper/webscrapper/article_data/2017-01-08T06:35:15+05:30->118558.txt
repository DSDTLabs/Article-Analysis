HYDERABAD: From the academic year 2017-18, all postgraduate courses such as MA, MSc and MCom will have common entrance tests (CET) based on the streams they are pursuing. 

 Vice-chancellors of all state universities agreed to the proposal tabled during a meeting held at the   (TSCHE) late on Friday .
 
 As per discussions, the council will now constitute a committee including vice-chancellors of Osmania University, Kakatiya University and TSCHE officials, other than senior professors from various universities, to look into the possibilities and challenges of conducting CET for PG courses. 
 
 “Right now, Osmania   conduct two separate tests for admissions to various PG courses for colleges affiliated to all universities in Telangana. Our attempt is to have a uniform admission process not only for university colleges but also affiliated colleges,“ said Papi Reddy, chairman of TSCHE.
 
 The proposal was floated by deputy chief minister and education minister   in his first meeting with the vice-chancellors after their appointment in October last year. Students will not have to write two separate tests as the subjects will be divided between OU and Kakatiya.
