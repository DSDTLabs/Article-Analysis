KRISHNAGIRI: Collector C   has directed HR&CE officials in the district to submit a report on the assets and non-movable properties owned by the department and action taken to retrieve encroached temple lands. 

 In a letter sent to HR&CE officials a couple of days ago, the collector has also sought details about inspections carried out by officials on those assets and properties. 
 
 Chiding officials for their apathy in retrieving encroached temple lands, Kathiravan said in the letter that the district would top in the state on retrieving temple lands if HR&CE officials take at least one step a day. “The collector also rapped the officials for not discussing these issues with the district administration on any occasion,” an official in the district administration said.
 
 On June 20, 2015, T P  , then   collector, chaired a meeting with HR&CE officials on encroached temple lands. He had directed the officials to inspect the entire district to know the ground reality of the lands encroached by miscreants. He had also a sought a report within 15 days. 
 
 “After 15 days, HR&CE officials informed Rajesh that more than 500 acres of temple lands worth more than several crores were encroached by several miscreants,” said an official from Krishnagiri district HR&CE department, on condition of anonymity. Talking to TOI, he said Rajesh directed them to initiate stern action against miscreants and to retrieve those lands from them. However, the officials did not take any action against the miscreants.
 
 When contacted by TOI, commissioner of HR&CE department R Jaya said that she has not received any such letter from the Krishnagiri district collector. “I will direct my officials in Krishnagiri once I get the letter,” she replied.
