Mumbai: Notwithstanding the shutting down of bars and   within 500m of highways,   earned Rs 160 crore more revenue in the last three months (April, May and June) compared to that collected in the same months of 2016.

 According to a source in the   industry and state excise, people stocked up more at their bars in home, leading to the 6% jump in excise revenue. According to the excise department, Rs 2,640 crore was the revenue in 2016 for April, May and June and over the last three months, it has been Rs 2,800 crore. This is despite the fact that many shops and bars on highways are still shut as the denotified roads are yet to be handed over to local corporations.
 
 Excise gave Maharashtra over Rs 12,000 crore revenue last fiscal. This revenue year, the target is around Rs 14,000 crore. Officials said looking at the trend, the target looks within reach. In Mumbai, around 290   within 500m of highways—such as Sion-Panvel highway, Eastern and Western Express Highways—had to down shutters from April 1 in compliance with an   order. After a couple of weeks, MMRDA took over highways within the city, bringing their businesses back to normal. 
 
 In the state, 9,925 shops and bars along highways had closed down or shifted beyond 500m of highways. The excise department had feared that the SC decision would eventually hit 40-50% of state excise government revenue which amounts to close Rs 6000-7000 crore.
