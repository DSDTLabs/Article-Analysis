CHANDIGARH: Biology teachers of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) board advise class XII (ISC) students to revise important lessons first. They feel the need for prioritisation because Biology is the last   in the medical stream datesheet and students are likely to be exhausted by the time they appear for the exam.

 The exam is scheduled for March 21. Incidentally, there are only two schools in Chandigarh that offer ISC under CISCE. The third is in Mohali.
 
 Seema Mahajan, biology teacher from St Xavier’s school in Sector 44 feels chapters on genetics and evolution should be revised thoroughly. “Also, some new   have been added in bio-technology and ecology have a high probability of featuring in the exams. Ecology is an easy and interesting topic, yet it contains many important terms and case studies added for the first time,” she said. She advised students to concentrate on diagrams saying it will compensate for the theoretical part. 
 
 According to  , biology teacher from Strawberry Field high school, students should make short notes, flow charts and tables and refer to them for last-minute revision. “Always learn the description of structures by drawing rough diagrams,” she said.
 
 According to her, “It is very important for students to time themselves by practicing 10-year question papers. They must have a healthy diet and avoid caffeine and sugary food.”
