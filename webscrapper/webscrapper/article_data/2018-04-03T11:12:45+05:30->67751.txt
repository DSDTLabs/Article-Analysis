AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education   on Monday, published   for   science stream.

 Board officials said errors were found in multiple-choice answers provided for certain questions in the chemistry exam. Due to errors in the options for certain questions, students of the Gujarati medium will get three marks irrespective of their answers to those questions. The board conducts a 50-mark OMR test in each of the subjects whose keys were published.
 
 Students who took the test in the English medium will get two marks due to the boardâ€™s errors in the chemistry paper.
 
 Surprisingly, one question had three correct options provided.
 
 The provisional answer-key for mathematics revealed that two correct answers were provided for one question. For this question, either of them will be held correct. There was an identical case in the biology question paper.
 
 The board has set an April 8 date for students to bring up issues or objections regarding the provisional answer-key by e-mail. The board has set a fee of Rs 500 per objection raised. If the student is proved right, the money will be returned. This move is aimed at curbing the number of objections received. The board had received 2,500 objections for the OMR tests a couple of years ago.
 
 The final answer key will be prepared after April 8 and papers will be assessed after that.
