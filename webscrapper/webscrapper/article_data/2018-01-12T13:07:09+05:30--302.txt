MYSURU: Migration expands one’s horizon, said former chairman of the Karnataka Lalithakala Academy,   on Thursday.

 With just a couple of days remaining to the annual winter theatre festival  ,   organized a three-day   based on the theme ‘Migration’. C Chandrashekar inaugurated the workshop on the Rangayana premises.
 
 Chandrashekar said, birds migrate travelling thousands of kilometres and visit different places during their mating season. They build nests, lay eggs and when the young ones hatch, they travel back to their homeland. Migration was a concept that grew out of boycotting villages in the time of epidemic outbreak and moving to other places in search of food. Lately, people migrate in search of employment opportunities, he added.
 
 He further said human civilization begins at the water side. The flora and fauna, too, depend on water bodies. With growth in population, migration begins. With migration evolves multi culture. Migration is the root of various cultures and traditions in the world. It is the sole reason why the 17th edition of Bahuroopi is organised after the theme ‘Migration’. People should not confine to four walls, instead they must travel across the world. In order to know the diversity of life, one must migrate. It helps in expansion of horizon, Chandrashekar said.
 
 On Sunday, paintings of the workshop will be put to display. Senior artists like Prakash from Sirsi, Somasundar Murthy, Niranjana Makali from Ballari, Ayaz Patel, Tarakeshwari, Shivakumar from Mandya, G Naveen from Udupi and Uma Patil from Bengaluru will take part in the workshop.
 
 Director of Rangayana Bhagirathi Bai Kadam, joint director V N Mallikarjunaswamy, coordinators M C Krishnaprasad and Mime Ramesh were present.
