BHUBANESWAR: At least five   MLAs on Monday said the reshuffle of the council of ministers by chief minister Naveen Patnaik would complicate things for the ruling party in the face of the BJP's relentless campaign to expand its influence in the state. They added that the reshuffle would demoralise party workers as they have not taken kindly to the dropping of 10 ministers and reconstitution of the council of ministers where 18 districts remain unrepresented. 

 "There is no representative from Jajpur in the ministry. The people of the district have begun to feel neglected and deprived," said Amar Prasad Satpathy, a five-time MLA from Barachana who failed to get into the ministry contrary to popular expectations.
 
 Speaking on similar lines, Parmannabh  , a four-time legislator from   district, said, "Resentment among party workers and leaders is growing because law makers who have won multiple times have been kept out of the ministry." Behera, a former minister, also did not make it to the ministry. 
 
 Another veteran legislator,  , who has represented   in   district for five times, said his supporters were very disappointed because their district had been ignored by the CM. His supporters, too, joined the protest, threatening to resign from the BJD en masse. Junagarh MLA Divyashankar Mishra also expressed his displeasure at the way the reshuffle was done. BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb said disappointments are 'natural' after a reshuffle. A BJD MLA, who spoke on condition of anonymity, questioned the inclusion of nine ministers from a radius of 50 kilometres from Bhubaneswar in the ministry. On Sunday, Sambalpur MLA Raseswari Panigrahi's supporters had openly opposed her exclusion from the ministry.
