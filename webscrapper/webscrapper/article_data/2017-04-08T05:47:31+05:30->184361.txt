THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Thiruvananthapuram chief judicial magistrate here on Friday granted the custody of CEO of Mangalam TV R Ajithkumar and chief reporter of the channel   to the police for three days for further investigation into the case related to the telecast of sleaze talk allegedly involving former minister A K Saseendran. The duo have to be returned to judicial custody before Sunday 5 pm. 

 In the custody application filed before the court the police had stated that they still needed to recover the electronic evidence pertaining to the case, including the sound clip that was telecast through the channel and the laptop containing it. For this, they needed the custody of the two accused and also needed to question them to probe the conspiracy angle involved in the incident.
 
 Meanwhile, when the two were produced before the court the lawyers present in the court premises welcomed them with loud jeers and verbal abuses, apparently a result of existing disputes between the lawyers and journalist fraternity. When they tried to sit on a bench inside the courtroom, the lawyers took offense and shouted at them following which the magistrate had to intervene.
