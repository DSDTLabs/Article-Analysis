MUMBAI: A 19-year-old boy sustained injuries after a group of six to eight men, including a local goon, assaulted him outside the college where he studies in   (east). The police said that the victim,  , hasnt told them much about how he knows these men and so the motive remains unclear. A case of 'attempt to commit murder' has been registered. 

 The incident took place around 3.30 am on Saturday. An acquaintance called up Singh and asked him to wait outside his college gate. When he reached there, six to eight men landed up and assaulted him with iron rods. One of the attackers is a goon with a crime record, said the police.
 
 "A medical examination is being conducted on Singh. We are trying to ascertain if he has sustained any fractures," said an officer from the   police station. 
 
 Singh lives with his parents in Kandivli. The police said that he too has a crime record. Singh will be quizzed in detail once he recuperates fully. The police will also examine footage from closed-circuit television cameras installed at the spot of the crime.
