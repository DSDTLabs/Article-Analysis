North Dinajpur: The Karandighi girl who made it to the dais at Mamata Banerjee’s Hemtabad rally and drew the CM’s flak, hasn’t got a job yet, her mother claims. Even the house the CM had asked to build for this poor family is half-done.

 Even as the sisters — Rabeya and Amera — remained out of bounds since they were whisked away by cops to Raiganj Hospital soon after they breached the CM’s security on February 22, their mother Rabeda Bewa picked up courage on Monday to contest the CM’s claim that Rabeya has got a job and her family a house under Gitanjali Scheme.
 
 “The fact is my graduate daughter hasn’t got a job, leave aside a government job. A private agency had called her for an interview for the job of ward attendant in a hospital. My daughter’s name appeared in the recruitment list. She had to undergo physical exam twice — the first on December 4, 2017 and later on December 30 along with others. She was then asked to deposit Rs 7,000 as security deposit to the agency’s Siliguri office before joining. We couldn’t afford the money,” she said.
 
 Security and Intelligence Service supervisor Jayanta Roy, who did the screening of candidates for the contractual appointment, said the agency had handed over Rabeya’s papers to police. But North Dinajpur SP Shyam Singh said: “I have no clue on this matter.”
 
 Rabeda’s reaction to the CM’s announcement that they have got a house was similar. “Come to my house and check. It’s only half done,” the mother said. “My two daughters didn’t have any ill-intention. They had gone to the CM to pray for her mercy,” she said.
