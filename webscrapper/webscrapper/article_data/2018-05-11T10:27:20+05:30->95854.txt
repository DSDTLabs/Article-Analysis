KOCHI: A woman whose life got trapped within the four walls of her house as she has to attend to her bedridden child, a victim of traffic accident, has been   of Rs 15 lakh by the high court. 

 
 The unusual step was taken by a division bench comprising Justice   and Justice   after considering an appeal filed by the child through his mother, Mymoona of Thrissur.
 
 Mymoona's six-year-old son was knocked down by a car in October 2006 and he is in a vegetative state ever since. Motor accident claims tribunal had awarded a compensation of Rs 31.05 lakh.
 
 While ordering an additional compensation of Rs 35 lakh, the court said it cannot be blind to the travails of the mother and ordered a compensation of Rs 15 lakh to her.
 
 In the judgment, the court said, "We are guided to consider award of compensation to Mrs Mymoona in this case because her life is virtually lost and she has been robbed of all happiness and peace in her life for over 11 years, which looks to certainly continue for the rest of her life, thus confining her in unending grief. She has lost her life without any hope for any   and we believe that it is up to the respondents to compensate for her lost Life."
