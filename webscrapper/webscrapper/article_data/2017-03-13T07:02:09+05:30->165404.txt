VILLUPURAM: Central Reserve Police Force  , 40, who was among the 12 personnel killed in a   in Chhattisgarh on Saturday, had promised his wife that he would return to his native   in   of Tamil Nadu during vacation in May to buy a piece of land and begin construction of their dream home. His body was brought to his native village on Sunday. 

 The apprehensions of his wife S Ezhilarasi, 38, a BSc and BEd degrees holder, that she, their two-year-old daughter and six-month-old son would not see him alive proved right. When she learnt that he had been transferred to naxal-prone zones in Chattisgargh from New Delhi, Ezhilarasi feared that a tragedy would raze down their dreams.
 
 "Ezhilarasi was worried when her husband was transferred to Chhattisgarh from New Delhi. Shankar promised her that he would return by May to buy a piece of land to build a house. He used to console her saying that she could manage the family while he was on duty serving the nation. 
 
 T Shyamili, Ezilarasi's elder sister, said the couple got married in 2007 when Shankar was posted as one of the bodyguards of All India Congress Committee president Sonia Gandhi. "He last visited us during the Pongal holidays. He stayed till February 3 before leaving for Chhattisgarh. We were worried due to the tense situation in the naxal zone. He said everything was okay and he would be soon posted back in New Delhi," Shyamili said.
 
 The body of constable was air-lifted in a special Indian Air Force aircraft to Tambaram air force base from Chhattisgarh. The mortal remains was laid to rest with full military honours at his native village on Sunday.
