NEW DELHI: A major fire broke out at the   of a five-star   in   ahead of a wedding function on Friday afternoon. Police said that no one was injured in the incident, but a tent set up at the lawns was gutted. A   could be the reason behind the fire, officers said.

 Fire officials said that the incident was reported at 4.30pm when some guests at the hotel spotted the flames and reported the matter. “The fire was spotted near the boundary wall of the hotel. Three fire tenders were pressed into service and the blaze was controlled within half an hour,” a fire official said.
 
 Preliminary investigations suggest that the flames might have started from an electrical equipment set up near the tent. The area was immediately cordoned off and a crime team was called in to investigate the reason behind the blaze.
 
 “Fortunately, none of the guests were near the spot, due to which it was easier to move them to a safe distance,” a police officer said. The hotel staff were also trained to handle such a situation, which helped in controlling the situation, police said. Police are questioning the manager of the event to find out what had gone wrong that caused the fire. The hotel authorities too, are conducting an internal inquiry into the incident.
