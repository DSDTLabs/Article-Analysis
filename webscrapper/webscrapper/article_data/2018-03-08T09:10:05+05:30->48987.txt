CHANDIGARH: Haryana’s main opposition party,   (INLD), has warned the Centre and the state government of a ‘Jail Bharo Andolan’ if construction of the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal is not started before May.

 INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala announced this at his party’s ‘Kisan Adhikar Rally’ in Ramlila Maidan, New Delhi, on Wednesday. Chautala said the BJP state government did not understand the intricacies of the court’s decision on SYL canal, even as Supreme Court gave a verdict in favour of the state.
 He said PM   did not even give time to CM   to discuss the issue and this showed the “poor efforts” of the state and central governments to bring SYL canal water to Haryana. “This also make it clear that the BJP government will not take any concrete steps on this issue in future. Therefore, being the main opposition party of Haryana, INLD will should its responsibility and struggle in four different stages; this struggle will now be final,” he said.
 
 He said Dadupur-Nalvi canal project, which was expected to be useful in recharging groundwater of the state, was cancelled only because the government did not see any profits from that scheme. “But in doing so, the BJP government forgot that the objective of this project was not only to use additional water of Yamuna for irrigation in rainy season, but also for recharging depleting groundwater. Besides, it would have irrigated 2.25 lakh acres of land in Yamunanagar, Ambala and   districts,” he said.
