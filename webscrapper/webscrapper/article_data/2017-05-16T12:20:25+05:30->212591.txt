BAREILLY: Several primary and secondary schools in the district were closed on Monday after teachers of these schools were sent on booth level officer ( ) duty for updating voters’ list for upcoming civic polls. Students who came to schools had to return home as there was no teacher to take class.
 
  According to sources, many teachers were given BLO duty at the last moment as Monday was the last date for updating the voters’ list.
  
  Of the total 160 primary and secondary schools situated under city block, 136 teachers were assigned BLO duty. “As Monday was the last day of BLO duty and much work was pending, few teachers were asked to go on Sunday. Most of these teachers are lone teachers at their respective schools and hence, such schools were closed on Monday,” said a senior official on the condition of anonymity.
  
  Students at these schools were forced to return home when they found that teachers are absent. Even the teacher at secondary school Kharoa had written on blackboard that he has “gone for BLO duty at booth number 131. Block education officer has directed to close the school.”
  
  When TOI contacted one of the teachers who were assigned BLO duty, he said, “I had informed block education officer to give duty to someone else because studies will be affected. However, my pleas went on deaf ears. The closure of schools for official purpose is unjustified.”
  
  However, city block education officer Narendra Singh   denied that schools were closed. When he was told that TOI has pictures as evidence, Pawar said, “I am not aware about it. I will seek information from schools in this connection.”
