MUMBAI: The   (HC) has upheld the state government's new rules that give freedom to school managements in admitting students under the   (RTE) quota.

 A division bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Girish Kulkarni dismissed a public interest litigation that had challenged a government resolution of January 10, 2017. The petitioner, Sava ri Selvan, claimed that the rules give the management freedom in granting admissions for the 25% seats reserved for students coming from poor families. The RTE provides for free education for such students.
 
 The petitioner objected to the state's decision to allow schools to charge transport costs to students who stay more than 3km from the school. “We find that the said government resolution is a policy decision of the state government (and does not offend) the provisions of the  ,“ said the judges, adding, “We may observe that in fact the clauses being objected by the petitioner, in our opinion, further the object and purpose of (law) which is to ensure that all admissions under 25% free seats are utilized and no seats remain vacant.“
 
 The HC said that how the benefit of the RTE quota could be given to students could be regulated by the state. “The freedom which is being granted to the school management, in our opinion, would not in any manner dilute the requirement and the rigor (of the special law)...In any case, if any person is aggrieved by the decision of the management not to admit the students, such person can approach the appropriate authorities for redressal of any grievances which can looked into the facts of the case,“ the HC held.
