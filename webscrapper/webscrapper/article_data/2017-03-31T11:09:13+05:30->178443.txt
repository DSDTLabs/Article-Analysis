Surat: Diamond City residents, especially those regularly travelling towards Mumbai, are unhappy with railway minister Suresh Prabhu. 

 During his maiden visit to the city on February 5, Prabhu had announced starting of business-class Tejas train between Surat and Mumbai. 
 
 Indian Railways has prepared a detailed plan report for Tejas train. The train will start from Dadar at 7.20am and will have eight intermediate stops, including Andheri, Borivali, Virar, Vapi etc. and will reach Surat at 10:50am. The train will return from Surat at 4.55pm and reach Dadar at 8.35pm. 
 
 The three-and-a-half-hour journey is 15 minutes longer than the time taken by Shatabdi Express but the ticket fare in Tejas train is 30 per cent higher than it. Shatabdi Express has just two halts at Borivali and Vapi. 
 
 Surat Railway Station Development Citizen Forum (SRSDCF) member Rajesh Modi told TOI, “We were elated when the railway minister announced high-speed Tejas train between Surat-Mumbai. But, the joy was short-lived for the business-class travellers. Nobody would want to travel in Tejas which takes three-and-a-half-hour to reach Dadar and stops at eight stations. We are ready to pay more, but the train should run from Surat in the morning instead of Dadar.”
 
 Sources said   completed a feasibility study on the train for the route and the report has been submitted to the Railway Board. WR spokesperson said the plan to introduce Tejas train between Mumbai-Surat was prepared, soon after the railway minister made the announcement. 
 
 Tejas is targeted at business travellers, who are willing to pay more for better services. The fare is expected to be 30 per cent more than Shatabdi Express. Nine routes have been identified for Tejas train, including Mumbai-Goa, Mumbai-Ahmedabad, Delhi-Chandigarh and Nagpur-Secunderabad.
