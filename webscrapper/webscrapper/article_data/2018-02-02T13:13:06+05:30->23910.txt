BHOPAL: A 25-year-old man due to get married on February 6 was bobbitised by unidentified assailants as he stepped out of his home in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh on Thursday morning to relieve himself. The accused also took away the severed genital with them, dashing any hopes of reconstructive surgery.

 Police are yet to identify the accused and were not able to ascertain the motive. “We are clueless. He is not in any condition to say anything,” said subinspector Amit Sharma.
 
 Sharma said the crime scene was searched for his organ for reconstructive surgery, but to no avail. Villagers told police the victim had gone to relieve himself by the river when he was overpowered by two people and bobbitised.
 
 “The relatives of the victim, too, have not named anyone as a suspect, so we are not drawing any conclusion and are waiting for a statement from the victim,” said the investigating officer.
