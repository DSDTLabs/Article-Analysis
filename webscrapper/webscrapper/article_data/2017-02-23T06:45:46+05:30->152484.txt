THRISSUR: The festival coordination committee activists who had called a   on Thursday received a setback with a senior central government official making it clear that no prohibited items can be used in fireworks displays.

 Industries department joint secretary Shailendra Singh, deputed by Union minister   for a ground-level assessment of the demands of the festival committees in Thrissur and  , said this cannot be allowed. â€œThey cannot use prohibited items like gundu, kuzhiminni and amittu in the display as per the existing laws, and the district officials cannot give sanction for use of such items, unless those laws are amended by the government. I have submitted the report to the minister and it is for the government to take a call,'' Singh said on phone from New Delhi.
 
 Notwithstanding the state cabinet decision to support the smooth conduct of Thrissur Pooram, the Kerala festival coordination committee had on Wednesday decided to go ahead with the hartal called by them in Thrissur on Thursday . The backing out of the CPM leader   from the hartal call was another setback to them.Babu, district president of the committee, was conspicuous by his absence at the press conference where the decision to go ahead with the hartal was announced on Wednesday. Committee convener T Sasikumar said their protest was against the decision of the district officials to tighten regulations on the fireworks displays for all the festivals and not just Thrissur Pooram. They want the state government to promulgate an ordinance for the smooth conduct of the festivals.
 
 The immediate provocation for the agitation was the decision of authorities to deny permission to use these items in   on February 26 and 28.T he Cong ress, BJP, the VHP and temple protection council have extended support to the hartal.
