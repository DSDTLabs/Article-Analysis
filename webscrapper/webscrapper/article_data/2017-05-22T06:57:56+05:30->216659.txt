BIJNOR: After a year-long wait, the   has given a “no objection” certificate for building a section of the 800-metre-long under-construction   across   through  . The forest department had earlier refrained from giving its approval fearing the bridge would disturb wildlife in the forest.

  The construction of the bridge started in 2008 with an aim to connect Bijnor district’s Chandpur with Meerut. Once completed, the bridge would reduce the distance between Bijnor and Chandpur by 30 km.
  
 OP Ram, junior engineer, Setu Nirman Nigam, said, “We had applied for an NOC to the forest officials in Lucknow in 2008 but we had not got an NOC from forest department. Now, we have got NOC in this regard.”
 
  About 65% of the construction work has been completed by the Uttar Pradesh Rajya Setu Nirman Nigam. Earlier, work came to a standstill due to the shortage of funds. But a sum of Rs 15 crore was released in January, 2016. It was then that the forest department in Meerut objected to its construction as no NOC had been acquired by the bridge authorities.
 
  Giving details, divisional forest officer M Semmaran, told TOI that recently forest department has given an NOC for construction of the bridge in the forest area but with some riders. Accordingly, Setu Nirman Nigam and PWD would have to give funds to the forest department for plantation of saplings as a large number of trees would be felled in the sanctuary when the road and bridge is built. In addition, they would have to provide rescue vehicles to ferry wild animals in case they were injured, the DFO added.
 
  Talking with TOI, Bijnor MP Bhartendra Singh said, “This bridge falls under my constituency area. It will connect Chandpur with Hastinapur (Mawana). It is good news for us. It will prove a milestone for the development of Bijnor Lok Sabha area.”
