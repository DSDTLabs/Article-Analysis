NEW DELHI: The standard of umpiring in IPL has yet again come under the scanner - thanks to  , who missed a genuine no-ball towards the fag end of the   and   game in Hyderabad on Sunday. 

 
 The home team SRH eventually fell short by four runs while chasing a winning target of 183. The hosts would have got an extra run and a free hit and who knows, they could have also gone over the rope if the no-ball was called.
 
 
 
 
 
 Before the social media started trolling Kulkarni for his lacklustre decision, the SRH team management too was upset and mentioned the error of the leg-umpire in the captain’s report. “Even the SRH players were quite disturbed about the fact that the umpire missed out on a genuine no-ball. There is no denying the fact that errors happen, but when there is technology available, the umpires should take help in case of doubt. This is happening too often in IPL,” a source added.
 
 Sources said that the SRH team manager also met match referee Sunil Chaturvedi right after the game, but it wasn’t revealed what transpired between them. But sources confirmed that the SRH managers did mention about the no-ball issue in the captain’s report. “If such an error goes unnoticed, it has to be mentioned by someone,” the source insisted.
 
 In the 17th over, Shardul Thakur bowled a full toss above the waist to SRH captain  . The leg-umpires have been given the right to call no-balls and check bouncers, but Kulkarni didn’t call it a no-ball and also didn’t check with the TV umpires. Even Williamson was stunned to see the decision. But he didn’t make a fuss out of it then.
