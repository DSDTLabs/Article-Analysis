HYDERABAD: Just two days after a daily wage worker was killed by an   doing a wheelie, a video of a woman being dragged for about 100 metres by the three-wheeler at Attapur went viral on Tuesday. Though police were able to establish where the incident took place, they could not ascertain the time of the  . 

 In the cell-phone recorded video, a woman wearing red and white chudidar over sky blue trousers and black stole, was just about to board the auto, when the three-wheeler started speeding away and the woman was dragged on the road for about 100 metres. Two men and a woman ran after the auto for some distance and the victim was seen limping her way back with the help of the others.
 
 “We have analysed the video in circulation and it shows a boy sitting in the auto with a burqa-clad woman. It appears as if the auto driver had sped away when the woman was about to board and the vehicle registration number is not visible,” Rajendranagar inspector V Umender said.
 
 By analysing the video frame by frame, cops have identified that the incident had taken place between   and South India Shopping Mall near Hyderguda X Roads on the Attapur-Rethibowli road.
 
 “We have checked with all shopkeepers at the location. Everybody said that no such incident had taken place recently. It has definitely not happened today. We are analysing old   camera footages from various shops to find out when it happened,” the inspector said.
 
 Police are also checking with local auto drivers, colony dwellers living nearby and staff of hospitals to get some details about the accident. The inspector said that neither the person who recorded the video nor the victim or any eye-witnesses have approached them to provide any details about the incident so far.
 
 “If we get any details about the incident, a case will be registered,” assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Rajendranagar K Ganga Reddy said.
