 Even after a decade, Kochi corporation is unable to complete the construction of its main office at  . The work started in 2004 is yet to be completed. "Many projects announced in the current budget are repetitions. Shame on corporation authorities that they couldn't complete these projects even after years.

 Construction of new theatre-cum-shopping complex was in the budget for 2017-18. The same project also figures in the budget for 2018-19. Another project which Kochi corporation has been announcing in the past several budgets is construction of Mahakavi G Memorial. Construction of a modern slaughterhouse in  , setting up rainwater harvesting in government offices in corporation limits and construction of public toilets have also been repeated in the past.
