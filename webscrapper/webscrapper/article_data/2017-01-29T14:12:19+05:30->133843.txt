PANAJI: Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday said that the Bharatiya Janta Party ( ) was running scared after the Shiv Sena and the Subhash Velingkar-led rebel RSS Goa prant formed an alliance. 

 While refusing to state whether the party would withdraw support to the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in Maharashtra, Raut did say that if the results of the February 4 state assembly elections were in favour of the   (GSM) combine, then it would have significant impact on national elections.
 
 “BJP is scared of this coming together of Shiv Sena and  . We have started a movement and that has shaken the BJP,” Raut said while speaking to reporters after releasing the GSM-Shiv Sena manifesto for the upcoming assembly elections.
 
 The GSM is backed by the breakaway RSS group led by Velingkar which is contesting against the BJP in Goa.
 
 “We will win the elections and what will occur in Goa’s electoral politics will have an effect and show the way for India’s political scenario,” Raut said.
 
 Though the Shiv Sena and the BJP have parted ways for the coming civic elections across Maharashtra, the party has stopped short of withdrawing support to the state government.
 
 “What happens in Maharashtra is for Maharashtra. We must focus on Goa’s future. We challenge the BJP to come to power in the 2017 elections in Goa,” Raut said. He added that the BJP government was prone to take its alliance partners for granted.
