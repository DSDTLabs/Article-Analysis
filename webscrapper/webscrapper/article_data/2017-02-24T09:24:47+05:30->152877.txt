LUCKNOW: Two more temples in the city have decided to adopt   to dispose of flowers and milk offered to the deity on Mahashivaratri on February 25. 

 Flowers at the Bada Shivala in Old City will be dried and utilised to make  , while at the Rajendranagar Shiva temple, leaves, datura and flowers offered will be dumped in a pit to make compost and at Kalyangiri temple, the remains will be dropped in plant beds.
 
 President of Bada Shivala temple committee Suresh Chandra Pandey said flowers were earlier thrown into the river but the new practice will prevent Gomti from getting polluted. “Thousands of devotes throng the temple on Shivaratri and quintals of flowers are used in puja and the next day we will collect all the flowers and dry them on the terrace of the Temple. Once they are dried, incense makers will take them for free,” he said.
 
 Echoing a similar belief, trustee of Rajendranagar Shiva temple Atul Mishra said they have dug a pit for the purpose of proper disposal of offerings in a nearby park. “The idea of not to dump randomly the remains anywhere was floated by women devotes associated with the temple. For the past several weeks the work of digging a pit is being carried on in full swing and it is now ready.”
 
 Manakmeshwar temple had inituated eco-freindly measures five years ago. It hands over flowers to Lucknow Municipal Corporation to make compost. The milk offered by devotees is used to make kheer and distributed as prasad. 
 
 “Hundreds of liters of milk is offered in just a few hours and watching it flow into drains was very upsetting as so many people die of hunger every day and we decided to collect it and make prasad after filtering it. This way, thousands of people are fed,” said Devyagiri, the high priest of the temple.
 
 Taking cue, priests at Rajendranagar temple have also appealed to the devotees to pour milk on the Shivaling in small quantity and give away the rest so that it can be served to poor children.
