PATNA: The Bihar Chemists and Druggists’ Association on Saturday called off their proposed April 12 strike following the state government’s assurance to review its decision regarding the presence of a pharmacist in every drugstore.

 “The government had issued a letter to ensure the presence of a pharmacist in every drugstore. However, there is no data available with the government about the number of pharmacists in the state. The decision will be reviewed after online registration of the pharmacists. There are very few pharmacists in Bihar as compared to other states,” said  , the association’s general secretary after a meeting with the principal secretary of health department,  , at his office on Saturday.
 
 However, the members of Bihar State Pharmacists’ Association continued with their protest on Saturday. They have been on a dharna in the state capital for the last one week against the state government’s alleged neglect towards their plight. They are demanding online registration and improvement of the condition of the lone State Pharmacy College, Patna. 
 
 “Despite the digitization of several institutions in the country, the Pharmacy Council of India is still following manual registration process,” said Sitesh Kumar, secretary of the association.
 
 “Our demand is to make registration online and all medical colleges, as promised by the state government, should have a pharmacy college,” he said. 
 
 The pharmacists claimed that the laboratory, which is essential for students to conduct practicals, have age-old instruments. The hostel gets submerged into rainwater during monsoon season, adding to the woes of the students. But, there is no one to listen to their problems and resolve them, they alleged.
