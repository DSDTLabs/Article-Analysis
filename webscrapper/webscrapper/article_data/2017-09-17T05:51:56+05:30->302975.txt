PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son   on Saturday said he and his family were not afraid of central agencies, be it Enforcement Directorate (ED), CBI or income tax (I-T) department.
 
  Speaking during the daylong hunger strike organized by the RJD’s student and youth wings here over multi-crore Srijan scam, Tej said, “Why aren’t the central agencies taking action against CM   and his deputy   (SuMo) in the Srijan scam. Are ED and CBI made for Lalu family only? Why FIR is not being lodged against Nitish and SuMo, under whose regime the scam was going on for over 10 years?”
  
  Lalu and his party are demanding Nitish’s resignation alleging that he knew about the embezzlement of government funds and allowed it to happen for over 10 years. The RJD also targets SuMo alleging that he was the finance minister during major period of the scam. “We demand that CBI should lodge an FIR against Nitish and SuMo in Srijan scam and we will continue on our stand till our demand is met,” Tej said.
  
  Taking a dig at Nitish’s “zero tolerance on corruption”, the former state health minister said: “Why aren’t Nitish and SuMo resigning despite being linked to Srijan scam? Is their conscience not getting awaken now?”
  
  Nitish, while severing ties with the grand alliance on July 26, had stated that he took the decision on the call of his conscience. He had cited corruption charges against Lalu’s younger son and former deputy CM   in an FIR lodged by CBI on July 5 in a railway hotels-for-land deal case.
  
  Surprisingly, Tej himself is surrounded in several controversies, including a case filed by   in the court of chief judicial magistrate Om Prakash in Patna on Tuesday alleging that he “deliberately concealed” in his affidavit the details of 45.24 decimal land owned by him in Aurangabad while contesting the assembly election from Mahua in 2015.
