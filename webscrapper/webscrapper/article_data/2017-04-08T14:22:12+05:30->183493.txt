LUCKNOW:   ( ) has sought   from the state government to regularise the growth of   under its jurisdiction. 

 LDA’s regulation of building operations (RBO) wing claims that over a thousand private colonies have mushroomed across the city in the past three decades which have to be regulated as per UP Housing and Urban Planning Act 1973 which empowers development authorities to take action against offenders.
 
 In 2009, LDA’s jurisdiction was increased from 650 sqkm to about 1,100 sqkm. The housing authorities then decided that all the development till 2009 would be legalised while the ones taking place later would follow LDA’s rules and comply with building bylaws.
 
 Though the 2009 orders widened LDA’s jurisdiction, there were no guidelines on how to regularise the already established private colonies in the expanded area. Because of no rules till 2009, illegal construction had mushroomed in the outskirts along the highways. It is to regularise those that LDA needs a set of rules from the state government. 
 
 Under section 26 and 27 of the act, LDA can send notices to the lawbreakers and can impose penalty on them to compound their map. LDA’s town planning department said, “The colonies can either be regularised by taking compounding fee from them to rectify maps or making relaxations in building bylaws in private colonies.” The idea is to relax the norms so that most private colonies can be regularised as per the act and builders are encouraged to come forward for rectifying their maps. 
 
 Rs 50,000 fine against illegal construction- The UP Housing and Urban Planning Act 1973 provides for Rs 50,000 penalty on builders against illegal construction and Rs 2,500 penalty per day once his crime is proved. On Friday, LDA V-C issued orders to penalise offenders. Three engineers were removed from field and attached to office following their negligence in preventing illegal construction on Friday.
