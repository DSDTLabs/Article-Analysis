NAGPUR: Due to repeated   at   pumping station, the city is staring at a  . Another major shutdown of the   will cause 60% of the city to go without water. Those getting water through tankers will be affected too. MSEDCL’s unreliable power supply and weak power infrastructure are responsible for the alarming situation.

 The water level of Gorewada lake has dropped to its lowest mark this year at 312.69 metres. The normal level is 315 m.
 
 “Two major outages occured at the Navegaon-Khairi pumping station. The first was for 12 hours on May 14 and second was for three hours on May 18. No water reached from Navegaon-Khairi to NMC’s pumping stations during that time leading to OCW drawing from Gorewada lake resulting in less storage in the lake. The water supply to the city was badly affected due to the outages especially by the one on May 14,” a spokesperson for Orange City Water (OCW) told the media.
 
 “Normally, if the water level in Gorewada lake is maintained at around 315 m, in case of complete shutdown at Navegaon-Khairi the Gorewada plant can still operate at normal capacity for seven to eight days and 60% Nagpur including west, central, south and north Nagpur can be provided sufficient water,” the spokesperson added.
 
 Earlier, Gorewada used to provide raw water to Pench I, Pench II and Pench III water treatment plants (WTPs), which supply water to Nagpur. The raw water used to travel from Navegaon-Khairi dam located 45 km away from Nagpur to Mahadula pumping house via right bank canal (RBC) then to Gorewada Lake from where it was pumped to WTPs.
 
 After the commissioning of pipeline, raw water comes from from Navegaon-Khairi dam directly to Pench I, Pench II and Pench III WTPs through a break pressure tank (BPT). Gorewada has thus just become a backup reservoir to be used in case of emergencies.
