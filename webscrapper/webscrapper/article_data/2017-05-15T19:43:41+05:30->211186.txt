 The love story marks Parineeti’s return to the big screen in a full-fledged role after over two years. The actress, in the last two years, lost oodles of weight and underwent a dramatic transformation of sorts, returning to the screen in a leaner and fitter avatar. Pari also made her singing debut with the song ‘Maana Ke Hum Yaar Nahin’ in this film.
