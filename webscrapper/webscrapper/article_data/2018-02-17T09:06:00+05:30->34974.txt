PUNE: The Pune railway division has increased the rate of   from Rs 10 to Rs 20 at Pune junction. The new rates will be in force till June 15. “The rates were hiked to reduce unnecessary rush at the station,” an official said.

 Manoj Jhwar, public relations officer, Pune division, said the station sees more rush between March and June due to the holiday season. “ It becomes extremely difficult to manage the crowd at the platforms. Many people come to the station just to roam around. The rate was hiked keeping in mind all these things,” the official added.
 
 The station witnesses a footfall of around 1 lakh people every day. On an average, around 6,300 platform tickets are sold daily.
 
 Slamming the move, Harsha Shah, president of the  , said, “ If they are hiking the ticket prices, they should also ensure that the passengers get better amenities. Platform number one, which is better than the other platforms, doesn’t even have enough seats forcing passengers to sit on the floor. The condition of other platforms is worse.”
 
 Sandeep Sonaware, a passenger, said, “The waiting rooms are no good while the wash rooms are in pathetic condition. The hike is just to cash in on the increase in the number of visitors during the holiday season.”
