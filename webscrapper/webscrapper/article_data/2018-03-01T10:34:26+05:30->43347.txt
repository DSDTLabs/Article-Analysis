GAYA: The nearly half-century-old Anugrah Narayan Memorial   Medical College (ANMMCH) in   continues to face unhygienic conditions despite being the only tertiary treatment centre for about one crore people living in the five districts of Magadh division. 
 
 Patients from Chatra, Koderma and other nearby areas of neighbouring Jharkhand also come to ANMMCH for treatment. 
  
 Deputy medical superintendent Kameshwar Mandal admitted that almost all toilets are clogged. “Attempts have been made recently to declog the toilets meant for indoor patients and hospital staff and some improvement has also been made,” Mandal said. 
  
 Outdoor patients, attendants and other visitors are seen easing themselves anywhere in the campus due to absence of any toilet facility for them. 
  
 The deputy superintendent also claimed that resource crunch is the main obstacle in the way of making the place open defecation free (ODF). “India Power Corp Ltd, the company having franchise for power distribution in Gaya town,   and Manpur has been requested to get some toilets built from their corporate social responsibility funds and they have agreed,” said Mandal. 
  
 RTI activist   said pigs can be seen any time on the hospital campus, more so in the morning, due to unhygienic conditions prevailing here. 
  
 Pigs, according to experts carry several viruses, the most dreaded of them being JE (Japanese Encephalitis) virus. Gaya and Muzaffarpur are the two places in the state from where most cases of JE and AES (Acute Encephalitis Syndrome) are reported.
