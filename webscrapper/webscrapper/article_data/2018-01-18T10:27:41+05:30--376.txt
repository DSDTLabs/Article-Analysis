PANAJI: In view of the   strike announced by operators of tourist taxis in the state, the state government is gearing up to provide alternative means of transport for citizens and tourists who are likely to be affected.

 The government has instructed the state-run   to keep 350 buses ready to ferry passengers to and fro from various locations. Over 30 of these buses will ply to the Goa airport and railway stations, announced transport minister Ramakrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar on Wednesday.
 
 “KTC will hire the buses. We told them to implement 350 extra buses, which may be private buses also. It is KTC’s problem how they manage to assemble them. If they have to hire the buses from, maybe Karnataka, Maharashtra, or even private bus owners in Goa, they may do so,” Dhavalikar said.
 
 He further added that nearly 1,000 “private taxis” will also be used to fulfill the requirement. Rickshaws and two-wheelers will also be brought on board if need be, he said.
 
 Dhavalikar added that 600 cases of private cars operating as tourist vehicles have been booked. 
 
 “The police, transport and tourism departments will keep surveillance through CCTV cameras across the state to monitor the situation. Anyone guilty will be severely punished. We will also keep 20 cranes each in all four divisions of PWD to tow away taxis on strike if they try to block roads,” Dhavalikar said.
 
 As a precautionary measure, the sensitive spots where law and order situations are likely to arise have been identified by Goa police. IGP Goa Police,  , said that any likelihood of people assembling and forcibly stopping others’ vehicles from plying will be strictly dealt with. “No road closure will be allowed,” he said.
 
 He said that taxi operators will be allowed to conduct a peaceful protest provided they are given permissions by the north and south Goa collectors.
