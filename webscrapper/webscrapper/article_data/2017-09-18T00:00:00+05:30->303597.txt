 was in town for a break, where she spent time visiting her favourite spots and catching up with close ones. She also made time on Friday night to catch The Improv’s latest show, which is hosted by  , who was one of the assistant directors in Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey seven years ago. Talking about Deepika’s surprise visit to their show, Saad says, “Deepika’s sister Anisha is a dear friend to   and I. When we sent across a message to Anisha about our show last weekend, she texted us saying her sister is in town and would like to see the show. We didn’t create any sort of hype around her coming and, in fact, when she landed at the venue 10 minutes prior to the show, she was escorted to her seat and we then threw open the doors. It was only towards the end of the show that we thanked her for taking time out to visit our show and people were surprised. She was soon escorted out and we caught up with her briefly post the show. She told us that this was the first improv show she attended in India and asked us how we came up with those gags. She was very gracious, humble and sweet.”
Deepika also watched the   trailer that was screened at the show and commented that this was a very “niche” subject and she wished for it to work with the audience. The actress is a fan of Danish’s Nograj persona and follows his gags online, we are told.
