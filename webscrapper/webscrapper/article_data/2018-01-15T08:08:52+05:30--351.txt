 The council chairman KK Gupta held a meeting with tea and paan vendors recently and urged them to cooperate to keep the city clean and pollution-free. Gupta explained to the vendors that plastic and paper cups being used by tea stalls should be banned as these lightweight containers are littering roads and choking drains.

 Each tea vendor has been given two pieces of glass tumblers as a token of motivation. “Our municipal team would make surprise visits and if anyone is found violating the norms, spot penalties would be levied,” Gupta said.
