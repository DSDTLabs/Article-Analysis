Jaipur: The Rajasthan   on Tuesday quashed the state government’s notification granting incentive to in-service doctors for admission for post-graduate courses based on an year of rural posting.

 The single bench of the high court said, the incentive to in-service doctors could be given only for posting of doctors in ‘remote and difficult areas’ notified under Regulation 9(IV) of the Medical Council of India 2000.
 
 The apex court had earlier ordered that the incentive to in-service doctors under Regulation 9(IV) cannot be granted till the remote and difficulty is identified ad notified by the state government for all beneficial schemes.
 
 Accordingly, the state government had identified 1031 PHCs and CHCs in the state as remote and difficult areas. However, the government by a notification on February 28 this year added a one year rural posting till April 2018 also eligible for incentive under the scheme which was challenged in the court by Dr Amit Bagra and others. The court upheld their plea, said counsel for the petitioner Purvi Mathur 
 
 The State Government provided in the impugned notification itself stated that the incentive of service in rural areas, without the said area being notified as remote and / or difficult area for admission to PG Degree and Diploma Courses in Medicine will not be available after April 30 this year. However this is not legally possible, the court said.
