VADODARA: Panchmahal range deputy inspector general (DIG)   has suspended Santrampur police inspector M V Batul for dereliction of duty after he allegedly failed to conduct proper investigation in several cases he was handling.

 Chudasama said that Batul had not taken several important cases that came his way seriously. “Cases like major housebreaks and other applications were not investigated properly. The applications included those directed towards him by senior police officials. In the case of some such applications, investigations were not even started,” said Chudasama.
 
 Another allegation against Batul is that he had not followed the   guidelines regarding investigations into cases registered under the   from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. “The offences pertain to section 376 of the India Penal Code. There are clear guidelines in this regard that were not followed,” said Chudasama.
 
 Chudasama said that the issue had been raised with Batul on several occasions. “He was even warned repeatedly in the past,” said Chudasama. In the recent past, this is the first time that an officer of the rank of a police inspector has been suspended in the Panchmahal range.
