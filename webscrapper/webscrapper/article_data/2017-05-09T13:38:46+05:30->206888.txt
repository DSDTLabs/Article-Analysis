BHOPAL: Prime minister   will release the road map for conservation of Narmada at the culmination of Narmada Seva yatra in Amarkantak on May 15, chief minister   said on Monday.

 Addressing the inaugural session of a seminar on river, water and environment at Academy of Administration, the CM said that it would facilitate a roadmap for conservation. 
 
 In the presence of Union minister for environment Anil Dave and chairman of National Green Tribunal (NGT) justice Dalip Singh, who is handling a number of cases related to the river, Chouhan said there should be a limit on “how much sand should be taken out from the river without disturbing the ecology of the river.” There should a difference between ‘dohan’ (tapping) and ‘shoshan’ (exploitation) of river, he said.
 
 Dave cautioned that if illegal mining is not stopped on the mountains in the Narmada valley and the cutting of forests is not stopped, people may one day “play cricket on the riverbed”. Dave appreciated the campaign for Narmada and said it should not be stopped. “He will be there as chief minister for five more years,” he said, as Chouhan smiled.
