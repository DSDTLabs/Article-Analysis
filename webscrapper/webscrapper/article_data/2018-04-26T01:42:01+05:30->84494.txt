NEW DELHI: A Delhi court, while sentencing a man to seven years in jail for raping a 20-year-old woman in 2014, observed that   is one of the most   and heinous crimes and the loss suffered by the woman cannot be forgiven or forgotten. 

 The court awarded a compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the woman., adding that rape is a “gruesome” and “abhorring” act that instils a feeling of fear, insecurity and a brooding sense of shame and guilt for no fault of the survivor.
 
  was sentenced for what the court termed a “devastating moment” in the woman’s life. “Rape is a gruesome, abhorring and ghastly act wherein a man acts as slave of his martinet and lowers himself to a baffling extent for the sole purpose of achieving gratification of his carnal desire. It leaves a permanent scar on the personality of the woman, inhibiting growth and development,” the court observed. 
 
 The   counsel had sought the maximum compensation for the survivor considering the mental trauma she suffered. The court asked   to pay the compensation amount to the woman after noting that the convict was not in a position to pay any compensation and disregarded the “moral and social values”, ruining the woman’s life.
 
 The police said on December 29, 2014, Javed, a contractor who was at the survivor’s house to oversee some construction work, had raped the woman and escaped when her mother came looking for her. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty, saying it was a false case and it was with the woman’s consent that a sexual relationship was established between them.
