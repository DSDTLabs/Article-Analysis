NEW DELHI: A day after a seven-year-old girl died and 17 schoolchildren were injured when a truck rammed the   van they were travelling in, four of the kids underwent surgery of their internal organs. 

 Meanwhile, a probe has revealed that the van was more than 16 years old and all norms for school cabs were being flouted by it. The driver,  , has been challaned for five offences. 
 
 Police have also seized the licence of the accused truck driver,  , as it was found that he was a serial violator of traffic rules. He has been sent to judicial custody. Kumar had been driving the vehicle for the past nine years during which he was booked for driving without a licence and allowing a minor to drive. He had also been issued a warning by traffic police for repeated violations in the same area.
 
 The area traffic inspector   had conducted a road safety awareness programme at   on April 23 and spoken to 350 children regarding road safety and regulations. In fact, the principal was clearly briefed about not using illegal school cabs to ferry children, an instruction that was not followed. 
 
 The van had a history of breaking down due to its age. Despite knowing this, the driver overloaded the vehicle. Most of the children suffered injuries on their head and chest after hitting the unguarded walls of the vehicle.
 
 Four of the students have been admitted to   with severe injuries in the liver and stomach that led to internal bleeding. Doctors said that a medical team has been formed to keep an eye on the children.
 
 Police officers said that   footage from the area shows the truck speeding despite the crowd. The driver could not control the vehicle after he noticed the van merging into the traffic from the wrong side.
