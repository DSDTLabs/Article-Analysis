PILIBHIT: At a time when the government is on a mission mode to equip every household with toilet, especially in rural areas,   still needs more than 2.38 lakh toilets to achieve the status of 'open defecation free (ODF)' district. According to a survey report, there were as many as 3,58,712 rural households in the district that needed toilets, and only 33% of these have been facilitated with toilets.
 
  The state government has set a target for the district administration to facilitate the construction of toilets in the remaining 2,38,701 households by October 2, 2018. However, in view of the progress of the previous two consecutive years and allocation of funds, achieving the target seems a distant dream. According to chief development officer  , the state government had allocated Rs 8,18,64,000 for the construction of 6,822 toilets (Rs 12,000 for each toilet) in 2015-16, while in the next financial year, a total of 8,392 toilets were constructed with an expenditure of Rs 10,07,04,000
  
  Dwivedi said that ODF can be possible only when the previous backlog is cleared and the forthcoming funds are allocated on a par with the total need for toilets. "If this cycle is not maintained, the periodical population growth will add to the backlog,” he added.
  
  According to Dwivedi, the first grant-in-aid based rural sanitation scheme with the provision of construction of toilets was first launched by the Union government in 1986 when Centrally sponsored rural sanitation programme was introduced in the country. This scheme was replaced in 1999 by ‘Total Sanitation Campaign’ during the BJP-led NDA regime. In 2012, the then   government renamed the sanitation scheme into ‘Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan’. Now, the present BJP-led NDA government at the Centre termed it as ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ in 2014 with some modifications, the   said.
  
  Despite efforts since the past 30 years, the district could not get the ODF tag because of population growth. Dwivedi said that “the policy draft does not subsume projected provision for toilet construction in proportion to population growth. Annual targets are assigned only on the basis of present population figures.” As per the official records of the district statistics department, the population in Pilibhit district grew by 51% in the past 20 years, considering 1991 as the base year. As per the 1991 census, the total population of the district was estimated at 13,44,627, and the total families or households at 2,13,476.
  
  As per the census of 2001, the population of district grew to 17,28,108 and the number of families to 26,68,53. And as per the latest census of 2011, the total population of the district was computed at 20,31,007 and the number of families at 3,62,573, said district statistics officer Tilak Singh.
