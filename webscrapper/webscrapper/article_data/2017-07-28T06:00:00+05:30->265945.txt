KOLKATA: Following the collapse of a large portion of a dilapidated house on Indian Mirror Street on Tuesday, which claimed two lives, the   on Thursday decided to send evacuation notices to the owners of highly dangerous buildings across the city. If the civic body failed to trace the owners, notices will be sent to the tenants of such crumbling structures.

 The amended building laws have made it easier for the KMC as it can now take possession of unsafe buildings if the owners fail to repair the structures.
 
 Earlier, the civic body faced another hurdle: even if the owner agreed to repair the building, the tenants would at times move court, seeking a stay on the evacuation order. “Now, we can arrange for evacuation of all the inmates of a highly dangerous building. After the balcony of an 150-year-old building on Indian Mirror Street came crashing down, killing two, we can’t sit back and watch other insecure buildings collapse. We will send notices to the inmates of listed dilapidated buildings,” said a KMC buildings department official.
 
 The buildings department will take police help for area-wise safe evacuation of risky structures and their subsequent demolition.
 
 A recent survey revealed that over 50 buildings in north Kolkata — most of them at  , Kumartuli, Rabindra Sarani,   and Burrabazar — were the most at risk. 
 
 “Our inspectors will find the most vulnerable of them all. Once identified, the owners or tenants will be ordered to move out,” said mayor  , hoping the residents would not protest much.
