Filmmaker Jayaraj's 'Veeram' has been one of the most anticipated projects to release this year - thanks to its stellar crew, massive budget and the protagonist played by Bollywood actor  . With the film making the list of films considered for Oscar nominations, the excitement of fans has only heightened. 

 As Jayaraj had mentioned before the release, the film is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth and is also inspired from the folktales of Kerala featuring the legendary warriors of North Malabar. 
 
 The movie is just 1 hour and 44 minutes long and the team has definitely ensured that crisp editing gets prominence while telling the tale. It has several impactful performances from Kunal Kapoor as Chandu Chekavar and Shivajith as Aromal Chekavar.
 
 In the first half, Jayaraj has filled the storyline with scenes showing Chandu's valour, his love for Unniyarcha and Kuttimani and how both women poison his mind for the impending betrayal. The battle scenes during Chandu's first fight and Aromal's victory over Aringondan commander are brilliant.
 
 The CGI department has worked overtime in showcasing vibrant backdrops reminiscent of the Ajantha and Ellora caves. The costume department also gets a thumbs up for the colourful attires.
 
 Kunal is all grace as Chandu though is a bit dour faced in several scenes. Divinaa Thackur as the vengeful Kuttimani plays her part well. With more drama set to unfold in the second half, the rest of the film promises to be an entertaining watch. More updates to follow...
