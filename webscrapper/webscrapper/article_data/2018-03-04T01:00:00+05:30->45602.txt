Here’s some good news for   fans. The actor spent last year setting the stage for five films that are in post production and now, he has signed two more. 
Abhay has just wrapped up shooting with   (of 'The Mummy' and '  Of The Jungle' fame) for the film, 'The Field', which is a thriller based on the land mafia in Delhi. The actor will be seen getting into a cop avatar in the movie.
 
 From the start of his career, Abhay has always taken chances with his career, even when it comes to working with first-time directors — Imtiaz Ali, Reema Kagti or Navdeep Singh. Five of the seven films he’s working on currently, are being helmed by new directors. Talking about it, the actor says, “I’m very excited, I love working with new talent. My endeavour is to raise the bar with every project I do.”
 
 Meanwhile, the actor is working on another out-of-the-box dark comedy,   that will hit theatres in April 2018. The movie is an afterlife love story and stars Abhay and   in leading roles. 
 
 Post the comedy, he will complete filming for JL-50, a Canadian production in Hindi. He will then start working on Sahlath, which will go on floors in June.
 With so many releases on his plate, looks like Abhay’s fans will have a variety to choose from.
