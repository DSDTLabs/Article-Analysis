NOIDA: Union minister Mahesh Sharma said on Saturday that the government had approved a 5.5-km long elevated   from   Regulator to Mahamaya Flyover along the Shahdara drain. The construction of the road is expected to begin soon.

 “The   will link Delhi with Noida. It will also facilitate a seamless connectivity from the capital to Lucknow as it is connected with the Noida Expressway, Yamuna Expressway and Lucknow Expressway,” the minister said.
 
 
  
 He was speaking at a meeting in Noida on Saturday, organised on the completion of the fourth year of   government. 
 
 In April this year, the RWA federation had written afresh to Sharma and the Noida Authority CEO for the construction of an   road over the Shahdara drain in order to ease traffic snarls on the stretch.
 
 The heavy movement of vehicles on the link road connecting Mayur Vihar Phase 1 with Gautam Budh Nagar chokes evening-hour traffic every day and commuters returning home from office get stuck for long hours. 
 
 The new road, which was awaiting an approval from the Delhi government, will ease the flow of traffic from Delhi to Noida and Greater Noida. Not only local residents, the traffic police, too, had suggested to the Authority that an elevated road be built to ease the daily snarls.
 
 On Saturday, Sharma also shared the details of various development work that have been either completed or taken up by the government in the past four years in Gautam Budh Nagar. 
 
 Sharma said that several roads had been laid under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and the LPG connections given under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana, among other projects. Sharma also promised a passport office in Noida.
