BHOPAL: A pack of   on Thursday chased a leopard in Satna district forcing the panicked feline to enter a house and hide under a bed. 

 The leopard strayed into Ward Number 4 in Satna town at around 8 am when dogs lazing near a shop in the crowded residential locality started barking and chasing the wildcat.
 
 Panicked, the leopard entered the house of one Rajesh Chaudhary and hid under bed where his children were sleeping. Eyewitnesses say that the leopard was so terrorised by the dogs that it did not move allowing Chaudhary to shift his children and other family members to safety. Chaudhary then bolted the main door of his house from outside and raised an alarm. A team of forest officials from the nearest Mukundpur Tiger Safari came and rescued the leopard.
 
  Hundreds of local residents had gathered at the spot to see the leopard cornered by dogs. "The leopard strayed into the town. Maybe it has used some old tiger corridor. Thanks to the stray dogs that it could be captured safely," said Rajesh Singh, a local resident. 
 
 Stray dogs are proving dangerous for big wildcats in  . On September 10, 2013, a three-year-old tiger codded P-212 was attacked by a stray dog near   range inside   reserve in one of the rarest occurrences.
