CHENNAI: One of the city's busiest roads, the   High Road has been dug up right in the middle making commuting miserable for thousands of motorists who take the road everyday. 

 There is a long crevasse running through the centre of the road outside Taj Coromandel till the junction with Valluvar Kottam High Road. 
 
 "Since it has been dug up in the middle, there is no way a rider can avoid the crevice. My back pain has become worse after driving through it for the past one week," said 70-year-old K Rajamanickam who travels to   from   on the route. 
 
 Since the road falls on a bus route, movement of heavy vehicles has made the situation worse.
 
 The road was recently laid before Metrowater dug it up to lay sewer lines, say residents. Besides, roads like Khader Nawaz Khan Road have been dug up for the line running till  , said an official. "We have completed the work and deposited the money with the corporation to re-lay the road," the official said.
 
 Corporation officials could not be reached for comment.
 
 Anil Arora, a 59-year-old resident of Nungambakkam who has commuted on two-wheelers on the road for 40 years, said the stretch has never been this bad. With the mercury rising steadily, Arora said the dust that is kicked up by the peak-hour traffic makes it worse for motorists. "It has been two weeks since the crevasse appeared. When are the authorities going to wake up," he asked.
