NAVI MUMBAI: Responding to several verbal complaints about bottlenecks and traffic snarls due to haphazard   of private vehicles on both the sides of the narrow road in the residential area in sector 40,  , the traffic department had proposed ‘One Side Parking’ to resolve the problem.

 The ‘One Side Parking’ has been proposed along the 10-feet wide road from Sadguru Plaza society till NeuroGen hospital in sector 40, Seawoods.
 
 DCP (traffic) Nitin Pawar said, “As there are several commercial shops in Sadguru Plaza society’s ground floor, the customers visiting these shops park their cars and bikes near the building on both the sides of the narrow road, thus causing bottleneck for other motorists and pedestrians plying along the road, resulting in chaos and traffic jams. The ‘One Side Parking’ is likely to resolve the traffic problem and help motorists.”
