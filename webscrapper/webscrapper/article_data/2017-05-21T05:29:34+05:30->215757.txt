GURGAON: The doctors at   have been forced to put the surgeries on hold after air-conditioners at the hospital went defunct around 10 days ago, sources told TOI. The patients are either being referred to government hospitals in Delhi and private hospitals which charge a hefty fee. 

 A senior doctor told TOI, “It is risky to give anesthesia to a patient if the temperatures are not optimum. It can even induce coma in a patient. So we are not performing any surgeries. Patients, who need urgent treatment, are being referred to hospitals in Delhi.”
 
 It may be recalled that nearly a week ago, local anesthesia, administered during vasectomy at the hospital, rendered a patient unconscio-us, apparently due to high temperatures.
 
 On May 14, TOI had reported that six out of nine air-conditioners at the   (NICU) were defunct. Notably, every week, around a dozen babies are delivered via C-section in the hospital. However, no C-section has not been performed in the hospital for the past one week in the hospital. Even the pregnant women who are referred from General Hospital in Sector 10 are suffering due to the defunct ACs here.
 
 The hospital that receives an average footfall of 2,500 people everyday, has no maintenance or engineering wing. This year too, the hospital administration has issued a tender for giving the contract, however, there has been no development in this regard.
 
 When TOI contacted Dr Kanta Goyal, chief medical officer, she said, “The operation theatre was set up three years ago, and the contractor who installed the ACs was supposed to take care of annual maintenance also. However, he has not been doint it. We have contacted vendors, but it is taking time for them to identify the fault.”
 
 “We have called for new tenders to repair any faulty parts of ACs. This will take a few days. We might purchase a temporary split AC and install that in operation theatre,” she added.
