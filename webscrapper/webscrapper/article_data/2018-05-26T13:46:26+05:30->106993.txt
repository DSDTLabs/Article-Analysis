ALWAR: The   police are facing flak over a shoddy investigation in a gang-rape case in which a Deputy SP (DSP) rank officer filed a dubious investigation report dismissing the   allegations, but when the rape survivor became pregnant the probe was handed over to another official who found the allegations to be true.

 According to police, a 25-year-old woman had alleged that she was gang raped by three accused on December 10, 2017 inside her house. She approached the court, following which an FIR was filed in January this year. The investigation was subsequently handed over to Behror DSP  , who in his report concluded that charges were false.
 
 DSP Singh sent his investigation report to an additional SP (ASP) rank officer, who closely examined the report, and found glaring discrepancies including the fact that affidavits of accused attached in the file could not be verified. ASP then informed district SP   about the contradictions in the investigation report.
 
 Around the same time the rape survivor became pregnant and ran pillar to post for justice. After hearing pleas of the survivor, district SP handed over investigation to DSP Bhiwadi, Sidhanth Sharma.
 
 When Sharma re-investigated the matter and spoke to survivor, he found rape allegations were true and three accused were indeed present in survivor’s house on the day when the alleged crime had taken place. Sharma found accused were guilty under section 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 376-D (gang-rape) of the IPC.
 
 The Alwar police said that it is taking the opinion of medical experts to conduct a DNA examination to further ascertain the case. “After re-examination of facts and other evidence, it was established that the trio had raped the woman. The matter is under investigation,” an official said.
