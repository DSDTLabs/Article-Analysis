GANDHINAGAR: Rumours of  , leader of opposition in the Gujarat assembly and senior Congress leader, quitting the party were further fuelled after Vaghela’s image was found missing from banners outside the   office in Paldi.

 Vaghela will return from his week-long tour of China and Singapore on Thursday. Posters bearing Vaghela’s face were reportedly removed in parts of Ahmedabad like Behrampura. They were replaced with posters bearing the faces of state unit president  , former president Arjun Modhwadia, Siddharth Patel, Shaktisinh Gohil etc.
 
 The Vaghela faction in the Congress is upset at Vaghela being removed from Congress posters. How Vaghela reacts on his returns on Thursday evening remains to be seen. 
 
 The Congress, however, still tried to put up a show of unity. Gujarat Congress in-charge and former CM of Rajasthan,  , said ,“There are no differences in the Congress. Everything is fine. Vaghelaji spoke to me before he went on tour. We will meet again when he returns. All of what is coming in the media is not true. The BJP is trying to spread this propaganda. The Congress is in a strong position and is focused only on defeating the BJP in the upcoming elections.”
 
 
 
 
 An aide of Vaghela’s said, “The removal of Bapu’s image from the posters shows the Congress leaders are ignoring him.” Another close aide of Vaghela’s and senior MLA said, “He is very upset at being ignored by the top leadership.”
 
 
 
 
 BJP national president Amit Shah will be in Gujarat on May 31. There is talk that Vaghela may meet him if he really wants to bid goodbye to the Congress.
