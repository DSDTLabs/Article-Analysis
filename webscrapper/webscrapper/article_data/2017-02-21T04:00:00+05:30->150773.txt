VADODARA: A week after   and   escaped from the prison ward of SSG Hospital here, city police are still clueless about the duo’s whereabouts.

 A case was registered at Raopura police station and the city police formed a team to search for them in their villages in Dahod district. The city police had even got in touch with Dahod local crime branch (LCB) since the LCB sleuths had caught Ninama in the past when he escaped from police custody when an undertrial. The city police had also conducted joint search operations with Dahod police but achieved no success.
 
 “There are very less chances that the duo must have escaped to a bigger city because there is always this fear of getting caught. Also,   is suffering from an advanced stage of tuberculosis so there is little possibility of their escaping to a faraway place,” said a police official, who is involved in the investigation.
 
 He added that there is a possibility that the duo must be hiding in a tribal-dominated village so that Damor can get treatment there. The city police have contacted some of the hospitals in the state and informed them about him. 
 
 Ninama, a rape convict, and Damor, a rape with murder convict, had escaped from the SSG Hospital in the wee hours of February 14. The city police had arrested two constables, who were in-charge of the ward, for negligence in performing their duties.
