If   was alive today, what would he say about today’s society? That’s what   has explored in his new single, Periyar Kuththu. Talking about the song, the composer says, “Forget his preaching, many youngsters today might not even know who Periyar is. We wanted to tell people what he would have to say about our society if he was alive. That’s the concept behind the song.   has penned the lyrics, and it’s so well-written and to the point. For instance, there’s a verse, sadhichavanoda sadi ennanu Google-la thedatha. We are so bothered about the caste of people that we are discrediting their achievements. We have touched upon various topics, like debating the need for erecting statues, factory-related problems.”

 Interestingly, he has roped in   to render the number. “I’ve been working on the song for about three weeks, and when Simbu heard it, he liked the concept. He’s shooting in Russia, and will return to Chennai this week. Once he’s back, we will record the number, and also shoot the video with him.”
