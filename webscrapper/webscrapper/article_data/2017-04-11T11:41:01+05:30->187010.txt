Everyone is shocked to know about Bihaan's death. Thapki calls Vasu to tell her that Bani left in some bus and she couldn't stop her.
 
  Balwinder and Dhruv go to find Bani and Thapki. Vasu finds Thapki's mobile on the road and thinks she is in trouble. They ask people around if they have seen Thapki but get no help.
  
  Thapki, on the other hand, gets kidnapped and is taken to a factory. Tina sees the same dream and wakes up in shock.
  
  Balwinder informs the police about Thapki and Bani. Vasu then gets a call from someone, who asks them to come to a place where Thapki is held captive. They all reach to rescue Thapki and shocked to see Shraddha there.
