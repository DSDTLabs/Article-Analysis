CHENNAI: Child protection authorities on Monday briefly detained five men at Chennai Central station on suspicion of child trafficking after they were found leading a group of 15 children from Bihar.

 At around 11am, Childline volunteers noticed the men in the waiting hall with the boys and alerted  . On interrogation, the men said the children were brought to the state three months ago to study in a veda patasala in Srirangam, Trichy. 
 
 “All the boys had dropped out of formal schools. None of them spoke English or Hindi, “ said E Malar, case manager of Childline at Central station. The boys were aged between 7 and 14 years, she said. They were returning to their native place for a week.
 
 While two of the men identified themselves as parents, three others said they were “guardians". “ But they had no identity cards, although the children had theirs. This raised more suspicion, “ said a GRP officer.
 
 The Child Welfare Committee in Chennai was also alerted.  , a   member, said she spoke to the head of the religious and charitable institution in Sri rangam. “ A ' babaji ' there said the children hail from poor districts in Bihar and he was only helping them. That still doesn't explain why the children had to be brought all the way here, “ she said. 
 
 The CWC wrote to the child welfare officer in Patna and alerted the GRP there to investigate the background of the men and the children.
 
 The group was later allowed to board the   at 5pm. “ We had to let them go. The children were scared, especially because they were in an unfamiliar environment. We also could not communicate with them as they spoke only  ,“ said Sheela, adding that the CWC would follow this up with its counterparts in Bihar.
