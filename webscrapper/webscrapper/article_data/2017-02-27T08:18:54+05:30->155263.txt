 Statistics show that over 65 corporators in Pune are below 40 years. The largest chunk of corporators is from the age group of 40 to 50 years, followed by the 30 to 40 years of age group.
 
 Collectively, they have accommodated about 109 corporators. As many as 26 members are between 50 to 60 years.
 
 The general body will witness the presence of eight veterans who are over 60 years with the oldest corporator, Bapurao Karne, at 65 years and eight months. Karne is also the most seasoned corporator in the house, serving his fifth term.
