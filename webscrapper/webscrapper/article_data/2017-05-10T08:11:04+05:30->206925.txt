PUNE: The death penalty handed to the convicts in the   gang-rape and murder case will bring relief to thousands of women IT employees, said  , who had supervised the investigations in the case when he was deputy commissioner of police (zone IV).

 Supekar had framed guidelines for women in the IT sector in the aftermath of the gruesome incident. He had also started police patrolling in areas with a high concentration of IT companies. 
 
 “I am grateful to the court that it understood the gravity of the crime. It was a very painful case, and we put in a lot of efforts for collecting the evidence that could finally nail the culprits,” said Supekar, who is now the deputy director at the police training school in Nashik.
 
 Main accused Yogesh Raut’s escape from police custody during his medical examination at Sassoon hospital was the biggest challenge. “Because of its heinous nature, the case was never out of public mind. In such a situation, when the prime accused in the case got away, we had a trying time. Collection of evidence and linking it to the culprits was a big task,” he said.
