HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad HC, on Tuesday, restrained   in Bhojagutta near Asifnagar from raising any structures and compound wall in the land allotted to it without obtaining necessary permission from the  . 

 The bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi was hearing a public interest petition filed by   leader M Srinivas, who brought to the notice of the court the recommendation made by the district collector urging the state to cancel land allotment to Society.
 
 Society counsel   said the state granted 2BHK houses and sites to the poor in the area. Petitioner's counsel N S Arjun Kumar described this as a new ploy by the Society, which, he said, was not eligible to receive the plots from the state. 
 
 He said the society had secured land with forged documents. Society's counsel raised doubts about the petitioner's bonafides. The bench sought a counter from the state and posted case to next week.
