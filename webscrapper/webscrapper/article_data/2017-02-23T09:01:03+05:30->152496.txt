MUMBAI: One of the most important festivals on the Hindu almanac, Mahashivratri, falls on Friday. This year is special as civic poll winners will make sure to pay thanksgiving.

 Police, meanwhile, have no respite from their long duty hours. In   Complex, Andheri, the   grounds had been converted into a polling booth. The policemen manning the centre said they had been working 12-16 hours since election preparations began. “Even after the results are declared, we will be on duty for Mahashivratri bandobast,“ one of them said.
 
 The open ground was quickly cleared for Mahashivratri. Trust chairman   said 15,000-20,000 devotees were expected from 6am on Friday to 2am on Saturday. “The 25-year-old temple has several sacred trees, including the peepul, and all of them have grown here naturally. We have erected an enormous mandap for Mahashivratri and made elaborate floral decorations. Since this is a festival when people fast, we will distribute sattvik offerings and pedas in the evening.“
 
 Babulnath Mandir near Chowpatty is the nerve centre where four lakh people come to pray. Manager Rameshbhai Gandhi said, “We commonly receive a steady stream of politicians, corporate leaders and film celebrities during Mahashivratri, but this time, the new corporators will make sure they come to offer thanksgiving.“
 
 Darshan will open Thursday midnight and close at 11.30pm on Friday. A large floral rangoli will welcome devotees including the governor of Maharashtra and municipal commissioner.
