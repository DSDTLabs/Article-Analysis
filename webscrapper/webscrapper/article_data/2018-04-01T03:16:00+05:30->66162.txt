Nagpur: Taking cognisance of the slowdown in real estate market, the state government has decided not to increase the ready reckoner rates for the financial year 2018-19. This is the first time after a gap of several years that rates have not been increased. Realty players have welcomed the move. However, this would affect the revenue of the cash-strapped state government. Local revenue officials said that they had not received any instructions from the government to revise the rates this year. Every year ready reckoner rates were changed with effect from January 1. However, since the last two years the government has been revising them from April 1.  Ready reckoner rates are government rates for land, houses, flats, shops, offices etc. They are basically used to calculate stamp duty on property transactions. They are also used to pay compensation to owners when the government acquires their property.  Builder Tejinder Singh Renu welcomed the status quo. “The property market is facing a slowdown and government has done the right thing by not revising the rates. Any increase in the rates would have further hurt the sentiment,” he said. Credai Nagpur president Anil Nair also welcomed the decision. Ready reckoner rates for the city were increased by 3% for 2016-17 and while for 2017-18 they were increased in the range of 0-4%. However, for 2015-16 they witnessed a steep hike of over 7%. Earlier, ready reckoner rates used to be far below the market price but of late they are far above market price especially in case of resale properties.
