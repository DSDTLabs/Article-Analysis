A stupendous actor, a feisty director and an unapologetic activist —   dons multiple hats. On a quick trip to Kolkata, where she will be attending a talk show,   — an initiative by   in association with   at   — we caught up with the actor for lunch at a popular biryani joint off EM Bypass. Even before the waiter could finish reading out the menu,   said, “A plate of mutton biryani please.” 
The actor, who later washed down the sumptuous meal with some steaming bhanrer cha from a roadside tea stall, said, “I am glad that I could gorge on some yummy food before I get on with the set of events planned for the day” 
 So, what else does Nandita plan to do during her stay here? “I will meet Mrinalda (Sen), who’s an old friend of mine. I never miss an opportunity to meet him when I’m in Kolkata. I’ve many friends here and most of them are octogenarians,” she added.
