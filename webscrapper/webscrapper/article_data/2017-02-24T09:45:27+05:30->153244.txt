KOCHI:   earned the nickname   after fraudulently selling off a branded bike he loaned from a friend in 2006. Suni, son of Surendran residing at   near Perumbavoor, was little known before the incident that earned him infamy.

 “He underwent a jail term of a year or so after being convicted in the case,“ said an official attached to  .
 
 Later, Suni shifted his activities to Ernakulam where he made new friends and launched a rent-a-driver agency based in Vyttila. But after a year Suni joined producer Johny Sagarika as his driver.
 
 “One day I got a call from another producer whose wife had a role in my film. Suni was taking the actor to the hotel where accommodation was provided for her in the night. The hotel was near Maradu. When the car reached Maradu he began driving in circles in a manner arousing suspicion. The actor then called her husband who in turn rang me up. No sooner did I reach the spot he stopped the car and ran away,“ said Johny Sagariga. A police complaint was lodged in the incident.
 
 Suni took on the job of a private bus driver for some time and got acquainted with criminals. He later joined actor Mukesh as driver.
 
 “I was not aware of his   then. He was with us for almost one and-a-half years,“ Mukesh said. “He was a well-mannered person and used to suggest good eateries during our trips,“ he said. “But he was a rash driver and when he failed to learn despite several warnings I sacked him,“ said Mukesh.
