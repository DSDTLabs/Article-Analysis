 The   in   at present is 5.1% and the department aims to bring it down to zero. In a bid to achieve the target, two panchayats in each block which have the highest dropout rate have been identified and the list has been sent to the deputy commissioners of all 24 districts.
 
 Secretary of the state education department, Aradhana Patnaik, said, “I have written a letter to all the DCs to pay special attention to the panchayats which have an increasimg number of dropouts, so that they can be reduced in time.”
 
 “While some panchayats have a drop out rate of only 1% others have more than 20% making it mandatory to identify the ones with the highest dropout rate so that it can be improved and the overall dropout rate reduces,” she added.
 
 The DCs have been directed to focus on these panchayats when the annual project ‘School Chalein, Chalayein Abhiyan’, to get out-of-school students enrolled in government schools, begins this year in April.
 
 Directions have also been issued to reorganise the school management committees so that they participate actively in bringing about the change in dropout rate. 
 
 “The DCs and education officers have been directed to involve locals and parents in this initiative, so that people send their children to school out of social pressure,” Patnaik said.
