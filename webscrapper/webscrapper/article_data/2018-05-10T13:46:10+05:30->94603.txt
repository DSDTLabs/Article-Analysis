PUNE: The Hinjewadi police on Tuesday registered an offence against a 40-year-old man from   for assaulting his male friend who refused to have sex with him. The attack took place on the service road along the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass late on Monday night.

 
 The 29-year-old complainant from Chinchwad sustained injuries on his hand in the attack. The police have booked the suspect, who is absconding, under section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 An officer from the Hinjewadi police station said the suspect and the complainant met in a gym a few months back and befriended each other. “The duo was also in sexual relationship with each other,” the officer added.
 
 The officer said after the suspect’s marriage, the complainant had stopped maintaining physical relationship with him. “On Monday night, the duo had gone for a stroll. When they reached the service road around 10pm, the suspect started pursuing the complainant to have sex with him,” the officer added.
 
 The officer said the complainant, however, refused his move saying that they should not indulge in sexual relationship as the suspect was married. “The man became furious and assaulted the complainant with a sharp weapon,” the officer said. “We have launched a manhunt for him,” the officer added.
