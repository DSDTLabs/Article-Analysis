NAGPUR: “Kashmir is the safest place for tourists in the world but many are under the impression that it is not. Everyone must come and see for themselves only then the general perception will change,” said  , president of   (TASK) while speaking at a seminar here on Friday.

 The objective was to create awareness about the growing tourism industry in Jammu & Kashmir among travel agents in the city. 
 
 Director of floriculture, garden and parks (Government of J & K)  , chairman of   (TAAI), Nagpur chapter   and president of Travel Agents Association of Nagpur Sanjay Deshpande addressed the audience.
 
 Deshpande said people who approach us with their travel plans to Kashmir often express concern over safety. “As travel agents, we must promote tourism in Kashmir and make people realize it is truly a safe place,” he said.
 
 In a brief discussion with Mir, Deshpande highlighted issues like time restrictions for being indoors and tourist being charged an unreasonable amount for particular services. Mir promised that the “the issues will be addressed.”
 
 According to Mir, tourism in Kashmir plummeted to an all-time low in 1989 owing to the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus. “The industry is now picking pace. Around 12 lakh tourists visited the region and over 1 crore visited the state in June last year,” he said.
 
 J&K is now promoting different branches of tourism like hospitality, sports and adventure tourism, said Mir. He also informed about marriage tourism and invited people to organize wedding ceremonies in Kashmir. 
 
 Mir claimed that tourism is currently contributing to 60% of the state’s economy and other industries, especially small and medium enterprises, rely on it heavily. “If tourism dies, the economy of the state will crash,” said Mir.
 
 “TAAI is working towards tourism development in India and J & K is our priority. This will greatly benefit locals involved in handicraft and other businesses,” said Nakade while addressing travel agents.
