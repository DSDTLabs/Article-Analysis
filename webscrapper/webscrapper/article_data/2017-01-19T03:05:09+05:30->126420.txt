NEW DELHI: The Delhi   has cleared the way for removal of encroachments from a   run by the  , saying that the patients were forced to “squat and beg” outside the complex.

 “This court is of the opinion that despite the state setting apart valuable land and monetary resources for maintenance of the said complex, thanks to encroachment and illegal construction carried out by petitioners, the patients have been forced to squat and beg on pavements outside public places and places of worship,” Justice Manmohan observed in a recent order on Tahirpur leprosy complex.
 
 HC’s direction came while dismissing a petition filed by the local colonies seeking quashing of the demolition order issued by civic agencies. The petitioners sought completing the process of regularisation of their colonies in a time-bound manner.
 
 The court highlighted that if the mischief is not nipped in the bud, the purpose and rationale behind dedicating a large chunk of land for rehabilitation of lepers would be lost. HC rejected the argument by the petitioners saying they are protected by the Special Act from being evicted from the area.
 
 HC said the Act “offers no assistance” as the land in question has been dedicated for a specific public project, namely, rehabilitation of leprosy affected patients.
 
 “This court cannot direct the respondents to complete the process of regularisation of the petitioner-societies as the same would not only be unethical, illegal, contrary to public purpose but would also amount to placing premium on fraud,” it added.
 
 HC said that the manner in which the place has been over-run by encroachers, another “welfare scheme stands on its head today” and due to “rampant encroachment and illegal construction within the Tahirpur leprosy complex, there is no further accommodation available to rehabilitate the leprosy affected patients.”
