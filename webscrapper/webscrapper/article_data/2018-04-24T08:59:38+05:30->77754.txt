PUNE: A married, Zilla Parishad school teacher (45) was arrested by the Sangvi police on Monday for   and forcibly marrying a 19-year-old woman earlier this year, in March.

 It has been revealed that the teacher, who has a 14-year-old daughter from his first marriage, was driven by a desire to have a son, and the kidnap and the forced wedding were means to fulfil that desire. The 19-year-old said her parents too were hand-in-glove with the suspect and had got her married to the teacher to pay off their debts.
 
 Apart from the teacher, the Sangvi police have also arrested the young woman’s parents, the teacher’s first wife and others. The names have been withheld on request from police officials.
 
 A police team, comprising deputy commissioner of police (Zone III) Ganesh Shinde, assistant commissioner Vikram Patil and senior inspector Ajay Chandkhede, nabbed the teacher from his house at Yermala, in Osmanabad.
 
 The woman, who was kept in confinement at Yermala, had first used her cellphone to prepare a video clip narrating how she was forced to marry the suspect. She managed to send the clip to the local police authorities, who rescued her. The woman then went to her parental home on April 10. However, she found no support from her parents, who instead wanted her to return to the teacher. Finally, on April 20, the woman and reported the matter to Sangvi police, and a case was registered against the teacher and 14 others.
 
 Police said the teacher’s family members wanted him to have a son and were looking to get him married again. Their search brought them into contact with the woman’s parents in Pune. They offered to repay a Rs5 lakh loan that the woman's father had taken and even buy the family a house — in exchange for his daughter.
 
 Police made the arrest under Sections 366, 384 and 385 of the Indian Penal Code.
