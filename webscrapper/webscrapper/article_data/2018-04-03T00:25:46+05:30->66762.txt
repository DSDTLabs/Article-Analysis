New Delhi: Delhi will be the first city to completely roll out the   112 by year end. This single number will help people reach out to the police, fire and ambulance service immediately as the calls will be transferred to the concerned agency swiftly.

 “By December, we will pool in resources together. Even today after receiving emergency call on 100, we inform the fire and ambulance services. But this is done through hotline. Once we have the integrated service, this will be seamless. There will be swift dispatch through GPS and people who have smart phones can track the movement of the assigned vehicle,” said DCP (PCR) Devender Arya at a conference on emergency care at AIIMS on Monday.
 
 At present, only seven telephone lines are dedicated to   service as a pilot in the capital.
 
 “What we require is better training of our staff, who often come as immediate aid in cases of medical emergency,” DCP Devender Arya added.
