SHILLONG: Two  , one at Gopinathkilla and the other at Bakdagre near Mahendraganj in the   district, have been completely washed away following   since Sunday. As a result, the Garobadha-Dalu road (NH 51) and the Purakhasia-Mahendraganj road have been closed for vehicular traffic till the completion of restoration work, as informed by the PWD (Roads), Mahendraganj subdivision. 

 "The closure was necessitated in the interest of the general public to speed up the restoration process for conveyance of travellers and rescue and delivery of relief materials to the affected families," an official release issued from Ampati, the assembly constituency of chief minister Mukul Sangma and district headquarters of South West Garo Hills, said today.
 
 However, there has been no report of any damage to life, property or standing crops in the Garo Hills although the weather continues to be inclement. Meanwhile, the weather office has predicted 80 percent precipitation and 87 percent humidity in the Garo Hills region over the next few days. There has been intermittent rainfall in the state capital too over the past couple of days with the sky remaining overcast and the temperature coming down to an average of 19 Celsius on Tuesday. 
 
 On the other hand, tourists from several parts of the country, especially from the neighbouring states of Assam and  , have been very happy to beat the sweltering heat back home in the plains. "It's amazing here. The weather is so cool," exclaimed Vaishali, a young student from Mysore, as she prepared for a yoga session along with her mother and friends atop the misty Laitlum canyons, just a short drive away from the city in the evergreen   district.
