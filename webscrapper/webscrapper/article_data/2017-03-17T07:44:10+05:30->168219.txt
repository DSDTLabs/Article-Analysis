AHMEDABAD: A class XII   had the entire physics syllabus with answers in the   which he was wearing. The student was caught by the   during HSC science stream exams at CD Patel School in Talod town of Sabarkantha district.

 The student, Navin Velji Patidar, was writing his examination with a digital watch when the officials of the squad noticed that he was typing something in the watch. 
 
 Meet Mehta, one of the officials, inspected his watch and found photographs of the entire physics book stored in it.
 
 District education officer RS Upadhyay said that a case of cheating had been registered and instructions have been issued to all invigilators to check and prevent students from wearing digital watches. The board has issued general guidelines which ban calculators, mobiles and pagers. He said that unlike Central Board Secondary Education ( ), the Gujarat board does not have expert invigilators to check such digital watches.
 
 Mehta said that, on Wednesday, he was on routine inspection when he saw Navin hiding his hand between his legs. 
 
 “I kept close watch on him from the window and saw him typing on his watch,” Mehta said. “It was clear that the student had a digital watch. On checking it, I found that the watch had a memory card probably of 16 GB as it also had four movies and lots of photographs. The watch also had a slot to insert a sim card. The watch also had a Facebook browser.”
 
 Mehta further said that he found a folder of data sharing app and, in that folder, there was a folder which had all the chapters of Class XII physics. “The watch is of Chinese make and has a square touchscreen of around three centimeters,” he said.
 
 The DEO has sent the watch to the Gujarat Secondary And Higher Secondary Education Board and the board will decide on the punishment to the student.
 
 It is worth recalling that the CBSE has already banned entry of students with any watch, be it digital or analog.
