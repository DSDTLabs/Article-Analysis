CHENNAI: It was an unusual Republic Day celebration on Thursday when Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam hoisted the national flag in the absence of governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao. Rao, the Maharashtra governor who holds additional charge of Tamil Nadu, was away in Mumbai attending R-Day celebrations. Among the dignitaries present at the function on the Marina, which till Monday was under siege, leader of the opposition M K Stalin drew attention. Given the bitter political climate in the state, opposition leaders are seldom seen at Republic Day celebrations in Chennai. Panneerselvam’s wife P Vijayalakshmi, who has never come to the limelight, was seen along with the chief minister on the dais on the occasion. As per protocol, the state’s governor unfurls the national flag on Republic Day while the chief minister hoists the tricolour on August 15, Independence Day. In his Republic Day address broadcast through Air India Radio and Doordarshan, which was later released to the media, Rao had conveyed his inability to do so. "It is for the first time that a chief minister in Tamil Nadu is unfurling the national flag on Republic Day in the absence of a full-time governor," C Lakshmanan, associate professor with the Madras Institute of Development Studies, said. Former vice-chancellor of Alagappa University A Ramasamy said in the absence of the governor, Chief Justice of the Madras high court or speaker of the legislative assembly should have hoisted the national flag. In this regard, two lawyers submitted a memorandum to the Raj Bhavan saying the chief minister should not be allowed to unfurl the national flag. Instead, the honour should be given to the Chief Justice, the memorandum said.
