NEW DELHI: A Maharashra legislator today chose to trivialise the 
  , and whether they are or aren't related to alcohol abuse, by scurrilously invoking other legislators', journalists' and actress  's drinking habits.

 A BJP legislator Shaina NC said yesterday that depression and alcohol abuse and not just being debtors are the reasons for farmers' suicides in Maharashtra. 
 
 In condemning Shaina's comment though,   legislator Bacchu Kadu infelicitously referred to the actress' alleged drinking habits, ANI reported. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Kadu - whose given name is   - has agaitated for farmers' rights in the past and is known for his Bollywood film-style tactics including using his fists at the drop of a hat.
 
 In December 2006, Kadu reportedly climbed an overhead water tank with his supporters and threatened to jump - a la a scene in the Hema Malini-starrer 'Sholay' - if the police apprehended them. He was attempting to get the Centre's attention on Vidarbha farmers' suicides.
 
 In 2012, he went on a fast to highlight farmers' woes and managed to get the attention of the chief minister Prithviraj Chavan within four days. Last year in March, the legislator from   in   district, slapped a bureaucrat in full filmy style.
