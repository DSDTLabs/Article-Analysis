KOLKATA: The fire on the tenth floor of the   building,  , on   has again turned the focus on the lack of firefighting preparedness in commercial establishments in the central business district. 

 
 The 14-storey building was empty when the fire broke out at 8.45pm that restricted the damage to a gutted office, furniture and computers. Firemen said evacuation would have been difficult had the fire broken out during working hours. 
 
 Last year there was a blaze at another LIC property,  , which had gutted the office of a nationalized bank on the sixteenth floor. Investigations revealed several loopholes like lack of fire drills, water in the reservoir, defunct fire alarms and water sprinklers and space for fire tenders to manoeuvre.
 
 Former director of   Sujoy Guha said, "Most commercial buildings in the central business district do not have adequate firefighting arrangements. One of the reasons is the lack of proper ownership of these buildings. The properties are either rented out or leased. The tenants or leasees are not bothered about firefighting preparedness. The owners receive such low rent that they don't find it viable to put such measures in place."
 
 An estate manager said, "Properties owned by LIC buildings are governed under specific guidelines. We cannot install fire alarms and water sprinklers as required. The modernization process is underway in many of our properties across the country."
 
 After the fire in AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria, in December in 2011, the government had formed a task force that had prescribed several guidelines. However, none of those has been implemented so far.
