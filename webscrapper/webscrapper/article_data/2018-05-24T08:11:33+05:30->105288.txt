  DEHRADUN: The kid’s zone in   that was inaugurated almost two months ago by the then mayor   has remained closed for the children ever since.
  
  The zone was built at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore under the Atal Mission Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme by the Dehradun municipal corporation (DMC) and was inaugurated on April 1. However, the main attraction in the zone, the toy train broke down on the very first day and since then that area has been closed.
  
  Visitors to the park say that they have never seen the gates to the section open. “I come here every evening but have never seen the kids’ zone open nor have I ever seen the toy train running. During inauguration it was declared as the first dedicated spot for kids in the city,” said a resident.
  
   , another visitor at the park, said, "Even before the work was complete, the mayor inaugurated it in a hurry because the civic elections were approaching. And now the area is nonfunctional.”
  
  When contacted, DMC officials said that they are in the process of issuing tenders for maintenance of the park and the kids’ zone will become functional by the end of this month. “We have floated a tender and have also selected a company for maintaining the park. The contract will be signed soon and the area will be made functional within a week,” said  , nodal officer AMRUT.
