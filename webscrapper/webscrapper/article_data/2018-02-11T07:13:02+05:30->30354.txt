PANAJI: A group of   residents demonstrating outside the Goa Forward Party’s office in the village on Saturday, said it was firm on its one-point agenda seeking the exclusion of their village from the Greater   planning area. The villagers were reacting to town and country planning ( ) minister Vijai Sardesai’s statement that while the   lake could be excluded from the planning area, some areas would have to be retained for infrastructural and vertical growth.

 “We don’t want any development under a planning area as it will only benefit the builders and those looking for holiday homes,” social activist Arturo D’Souza, said. 
 
 The protesters said St Cruz was already congested and areas included under the PDA comprised khazan and cultivable land, hill slopes and mangrove swamps. “The PDA will undermine the panchayat’s constitutional power to carry out planning. The village development committee has drafted good plans for the village,” D’Souza said.
