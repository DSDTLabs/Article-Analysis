NASHIK: The women’s cell of the city police recently held a series of programmes for   to teach them the precautions that can be taken to  .

 Assistant police inspector of the women’s safety cell of the police commissionerate, Manisha Kashid said that the city is witnessing many cases of outraging modesty and girls being kidnapped apart from rape cases. 
 
 “In this backdrop, we organised a series of lectures for school and college girls. The lectures revolved around how cases of molestation can be prevented, how to differentiate between good and bad touch and how girls are falling into the trap of social media,” said Kashid. 
 
 In recent times, the city police have registered many cases of abduction of girls. “Of these cases of abduction, there is hardly any case which involves demand of ransom. Many times it is found that the girls elope with boys. This happens mainly because they are in their teen years. Girls are not mature enough at that age to differentiate between what is good and what is not good for them,” added Kashid.
 
 Citing the recent rape case in the Ambad area, Kashid appealed to the girls to refrain from travelling to and from desolate places during the night. The police also provided the students with the helpline numbers, Whatsapp number and child line number asking them to download the Pratisad App. 
 
 During the lecture series, the police officials appealed to girls to focus more on their studies and refrain from doing things that could bring a bad name to their identity or that of their family and friends. Apart from imparting knowledge to students in schools and colleges, the lecture series were also conducted in libraries across the city.
