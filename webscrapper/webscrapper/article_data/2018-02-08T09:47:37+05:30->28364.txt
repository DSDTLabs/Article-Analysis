LUDHIANA: The leaders of   (SAD) and   (BJP) have finally reached a consensus regarding seat sharing in   polls. The   has accepted to contest the polls on 47 seats, while SAD will get 48 seats. However, sources revealed that the consensus was made after it was decided that on one additional ward, the candidate will be from BJP, but he will contest the elections on SADâ€™s party symbol.

 It is also learnt through sources that   was struggling to find a suitable candidate in this ward, and due to this reason, BJP had decided to give a candidate to its alliance partner. For over one month, both party leaders were conducting regular meetings to reach some decision regarding seat sharing, as BJP leaders were demanding 48 seats this time. Though BJP has now agreed to contest on 47 seats, but in ward number 88, the candidate will be from BJP, but use the SAD symbol in the polls. Thus, both parties will get equal seat sharing.
 
 The BJP leaders, however, claimed that Akali Dal did not have a strong candidate from this ward, because most of the voters living there are Hindu. So, the BJP helped SAD leaders by giving their candidate to the party. On the other hand, though SAD leaders admitted they did not have a strong candidate for ward 88, they also revealed that even their party suggested three candidates to BJP in three wards, because the latter did not have candidates from there.
 
 BJP district president   said consensus was reached, and both parties are contesting on equal seats. He said there is direct division of 47:47 wards, and in one ward, there will be a joint candidate of both parties. SAD district president (Urban)   said SAD-BJP had no fight with each other, but rather their competition was with   and other parties. He said they had shuffled a few wards with BJP, because at the moment, the only concentration was on registering victory in the maximum wards.
