NEW DELHI:   has drawn attention to some   in   and   of  , along with instances of  . The central auditor has highlighted the surrender of funds in 44 projects and plans of different departments that were in excess of Rs 10 crore and 70% of the funds allocated for 2016-17 due to non-implementation of schemes, non-finalisation of tenders and non-release of grants. The surrendered amount was Rs 2,206 crore, with 12 cases showing 100% of the grants totalling Rs 395.4 crore being surrendered. 

 Substantial amounts of Rs 136.6 crore, Rs 320.9 crore, Rs 341.6 crore and Rs 1,379.4 crore were surrendered in projects related to the departments of education, health, development, and public works & urban development. CAG also pointed out when the financial year 2016-17 closed, of the savings of Rs 8,835.4 crore under 10 grants where savings of Rs 1 crore and above were indicated, an amount of Rs 3,575.8 crore (47.47%) was not surrendered. 
 
 CAG observed that savings of the full allocated amounts indicated the estimates had not been prepared after adequate scrutiny of projects and schemes. The schemes that were not implemented or suffered due to non-utilisation of the full allocation included the equity capital for DTC for the purchase of buses (Rs 150 crore), installation of CCTV cameras in DTC cluster buses (Rs 90 crore), mohalla rakshak dal (Rs 200 crore), sewer and drain work by Delhi Jal Board under JNNURM (Rs 200 crore), maintenance of roads (Rs 100 crore), provision of LED screens (Rs 137 crore), CCTV camera project (Rs 200 crore) and midday meal programme (Rs 34.8 crore). 
 
 CAG noted that there was a rush on expenditure in the closing months of the financial year, which it regarded as a breach of financial propriety and, therefore, avoidable. “Expenditure incurred by the departments in March 2017 and the last quarter of 2016-17 under 32 subheads ranged between 53.75% and 100% of total expenditure,” the CAG report said. 
 
 The report pointed out that excess expenditure of Rs 91.05 crore from 2006-07 to 2015-16 was yet to be regularised by the Delhi assembly. Article 205 of the Constitution of India requires money spent on a service during a financial year that is over the amount granted for that year to be regularised by the state legislature. The regularisation is undertaken after discussions on the appropriation accounts by the Public Accounts Committee.
