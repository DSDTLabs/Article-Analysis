AMRITSAR: Hailing Ontario Premier   for carrying the motion to describe   as ‘genocide’,   jathedar   said her move had served as a balm to the wounds of Sikhs around the globe. He expressed surprise at the Indian government seeking withdrawal of the motion.

 In a release issued here on Monday, Gurbachan Singh said the Centre and Punjab government should pass similar motions to assuage the hurt feelings of Sikhs. The Ontatrio provincial assembly’s motion that describes 1984 anti-Sikh riots as ‘genocide’ was condemned by New Delhi that termed it ‘misguided’.
