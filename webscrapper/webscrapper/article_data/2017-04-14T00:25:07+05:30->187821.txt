NEW DELHI: Two men have been arrested for allegedly running a credit card   by designing a website resembling State Bank Of India’s original site. The accused have duped people of at least Rs 1 crore, the police said. 

 Sahil Verma and Monu, who are from Hansi in Haryana, used to charge people on the pretext of providing new credit cards with lucrative discounts and other offers. The accused, who are related to each other, were living in Gurgaon. After Wednesday’s arrests, the police are looking for three-four accomplices.
 
 The police said that besides the   website, www.sbiCC.com, the accused also created a Facebook page through which they advertised the offers. They asked the victims to pay online on the fake website. The payment was then transferred to a bank account opened by Verma using fake papers. 
 
 “Verma had impersonated as Pravesh Mittal and got fake IDs and an Aadhaar card prepared using this name,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 A case for impersonation, cheating and fraud by using computer resources has been registered.
 
  Both have been taken on police remand of two days, said Milind Dumbere, deputy commissioner of police (northwest).
