VADODARA: History-sheeter Kalpesh alias   told the detection of crime branch (DCB) that he had paid Rs 20 lakh to gangster   as extortion money and admitted that he had given a contract to eliminate him.

 Patel, who was remanded to six days of police custody on Sunday, admitted that he had hatched the conspiracy with the help of notorious bootlegger Viju Sindhi and history-sheeter Sanjay alias RX Dave. 
 
 Patel had earlier denied his involvement in the gangster’s murder.
 
 “Harjani had demanded Rs one crore from Patel of which the latter paid Rs 20 lakh. Harjani kept pressurizing Patel to pay up the remaining Rs 80 lakh but Patel wasn’t willing to. Patel said that Harjani would have killed him if he hadn’t paid the money. So he decided to eliminate Harjani,” said a crime branch official. 
 
 The police said that Harjani had sought help of Dave to kill Patel but Dave refused to help. 
 
 “Harjani had a big ego. He wouldn’t like if anyone said no to him and therefore he decided to bump off Dave. 
 
 Harjani had contacted a history-sheeter named Ramlingam in Rajkot and asked him to kill Dave. Dave learnt about it and joined hands with Patel to kill Harjani,” the police added. 
 
 Sindhi too was angry with Harjani as the latter wanted to take over his liquor business in Gujarat.
 
 “All the three decided to eliminate Harjani and roped in two shooters from Madhya Pradesh to do the job,” a police official said. 
 
 A team of police officials also left for Jamnagar on Monday to take custody of Anil alias   who had threatened a city-based bootlegger   on December 25. 
 
 Anthony, who is also a prime accused in Harjani murder case, threatened Sindhi from Vadodara central jail. 
 
 Anthony was later shifted to the Jamnagar jail. The police said that it had later found a mobile phone from barrack number 12 of Vadodara central jail and investigations confirmed that Anthony had used that phone to make the extortion call to Sindhi.
