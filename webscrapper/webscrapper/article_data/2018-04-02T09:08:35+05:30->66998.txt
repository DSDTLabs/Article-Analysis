AHMEDABAD:   on Sunday pulled an  , offering free beer at police headquarters. When the gullible clicked on the link, a picture of Dabangg star Salman Khan, with the message ‘Sapne mein bhi mat sochna’ (Don’t think of it even in your dreams) popped up. Police said this was the latest in a series of humourous tweets they have made on social media to engage youth in their campaigns on social awareness.

 This, of course, is not the first instance of Gujarat’s city cops showing a flair for disruptive advertisement and a penchant for humour. A few days ago, Vadodara cops used the famous ‘wink’ of Malayalam actor Priya Varrier to push traffic awareness on social media with Varrier’s image. Possibly, that led Ahmedabad cops to walk the extra mile in their campaign against liquor.
 
 On Sunday a message flashed on the official Twitter handle of city police “Exclusive- We are giving away beer bottles which were seized yesterday under special provision scheme. Visit Police headquarters at Shahibaugh with valid government proof. Entry before 8pm or until the stock lasts ## First come First Serve”.
 
 With Amdavadis being firm believers in absurd schemes, freebies and discounts, soon earnest inquiries began pouring in at the police control room. But callers were met with a cool voice on the other end which said, “It is a message to spread awareness about the liquor menace and to engage people on social media in the campaign against liquor.”
 
 Some who had the prudence to click on the link below the message saw “Hey..April Fools” followed by a “Dabangg” image of an angry looking Salman Khan saying, “Sapne main bhi mat sochna”.
 
 Additional commissioner of police (administration), Vipul Agarwal said it was a humorous way to engage people in the campaign against liquor. “We wanted to communicate with the young and April 1 was the perfect day for us. .”
 
 Agarwal added, “The humorous tweets will continue as we aim to engage youth in campaigns on social awareness.”
