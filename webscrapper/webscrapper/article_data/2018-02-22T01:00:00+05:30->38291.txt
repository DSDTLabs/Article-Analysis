Used as a children’s park or a quiet nook for students to study in, the   will soon be belting out the most rousing music again, courtesy the  . In a huge restorative effort that has come to an end, the bandstand (an octagonal structure in the centre of the heritage garden) has been reinstated to its original architecture at a cost of almost Rs 60 lakh. Says Kiran Dighavkar, Assistant Commissioner, A-Ward, “We are set to inaugurate the bandstand at Cooperage any time now. We are looking at March 1, but it may even take place a few days after that. It’s a pleasure to restore the space and bring back its glory. So many bands, including the iconic naval band, played here in the early years.” 
In its new avatar, the bandstand has new flooring and tiles on its roof and other decor items. Informs horticulturist  , who is associated with the project, “Our heritage department floated a tender to revamp it in 2016. The work commenced in January 2017. The roof has been restored — its wooden portion is retained, while the inside layer has metal to protect it from the rains and other climatic changes. The new lawn will have ficus plants along with the original duranta and musanda greens.” 
 There are rules in place for the visiting public too. “No eatables will be permitted at the bandstand and garden. The bands will be allowed to play in the evening,” she adds. 
 
  
  
 
 It’s easier to draw an idea from a representation of what was, but in this case, one photograph and maybe a second image, were the only things that helped the conservationists in their restoration work. Conservation architect   reveals the details, “Bandstand culture is deeply etched in the city’s history. It, however, lost its glory when the garden came up around it. Did you know that the bandstand was actually at the crossroads of the road? It got reduced to a mere shelter when the garden came around it. When we started the restoration work, we sifted through documents in the Maharashtra State Archives for more information as we had only one old archival photograph at our disposal.”
 A trip to the Asiatic Library led to another discovery. “We came across a book that had a clearer picture of bandstand, showcasing it as a standalone structure with stone plinth. We then meticulously prepared the whole scheme, where we dismantled the wooden structure (octagonal canopy) that had disintegrated to a large extent. There was a lot of water ingress from the flower beds around it. The wooden posts supporting it had also totally deteriorated. As there was special wood joinery that needed to be separated and reassembled, we called in a team of carpenters dedicated to doing only woodwork.” 
 As the work progressed, the structure gave out its own clues. “The task was then to reinstate the original character along with near-to-original materials. A decision was to avoid Mangalore tiles as it would rob the structure of its character. We replaced it with stainless steel material to match its heritage character of a lead sheet,” he explains. 
 Among the many touches to the newly revamped area will include an information plaque (shaped like a music book), featuring the archival photograph of bandstand on one side in front of the structure. To lend a lovely light in the evening, there will be hanging lamps in the canopy structure. “The whole bandstand structure is so beautiful and will definitely add cultural value to Mumbai. It is giving back the city its forgotten glory,” informs the architect.
 
  
  
 
 
 Says city historian Deepak Rao, “The bandstand is a lively place, it has stood the test of time. Around 1865, it was created for army and navy bands to entertain the public. A big aspect of the old Western-European culture, it then became a place for horse riding. Some years later, a smaller garden was created. It’s wonderful to have the beat back at Cooperage as the armed forces bands are excellent. Every regiment, in fact, has its own band, so this will be a treat, that too, for free. Greater Bombay Police band should also be invited as they are very good.”
  
 
 Says Kiran Dighavkar, “We are restoring around 17 heritage structures in the A-Ward. We have done work on the Flora Fountain, the Wadia Clock Tower, Mulji Jetha Fountain and the pyaav at Horniman Circle.” 
 
 Other names on the list include:
 - Kothari Pyaav and Kabootar Khana in front of the GPO
 - Kothari Pyaav in front of Metro
 
  
  
 
 
 - Bands started playing ever since the construction was complete in Cooperage in 1865. 
 - In the years to come, the space fell silent after Police and Navy bands stopped playing there. It turned into a place where people caught an afternoon nap or where kids came for horse rides. 
 - In 2009, a project led by the Oval-Cooperage Residents’ Association restored the place with some painting.
 - Cut to present day, there is a move to revive the space and bring the bands back.
