There’s a lot happening on the TV show ' ' this week. Everyone is terrified with the news of terrorists loaded with bombs entering the city.   tries to warn people, asking them to be alert and not touch anything which could turn out to be a bomb.

 The next day, Kapi and Babuji head out to an ATM far away to withdraw money. While in the queue, a man standing before Kapi requests him to hold his bag while he visits the washroom. But Kapi finds it strange when the man does not return for a very long time. He then alerts the guards about the bag, who calls for the police. Soon, media also arrives at the scene. As the cops investigate, they find that the bag contains a powerful bomb! Two men had planted the explosives as an act of revenge against the government because they lost a large sum of money due to demonetisation. These two men observe from a distance and decide that they will activate the explosion with a remote control when a huge crowd gathers.
 
 Saraansh Verma, who plays Kapi, says, “It was quite a tough task standing still for the shot when I am holding the bag containing the bomb. Nonetheless, this week’s track is an enlightening one. It is very important to be alert during festivals and other occasions when you head out to a crowded area, especially, when there is a high alert in the city. A small effort from our end can be of great help to the police, and save a lot of lives and also expose the act of terrorists.” What will happen next? Will the police be able to save Kapi’s life?
