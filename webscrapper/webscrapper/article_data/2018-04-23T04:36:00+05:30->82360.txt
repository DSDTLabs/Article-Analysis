Vadodara: A Baroda Dairy parlour owner was conned by a labourer of Rs20 lakh on Saturday. Victim Sagar Khandelwal was lured by the accused identified as Jayesh and his brother Anil of gold coins and antique beads in exchange for money.

 According to Khandelwal’s complaint, accused Anil came to his parlour near Makarpura GIDC on April 17 as a customer and told him that he has found a bag full of gold coins and antique beads while digging at an old Parsi bungalow in Daman. Anil informed him that he would like to sell them, for which Khandelwal gave him his contact number.
 
 A day later Jayesh called Khandelwal asking him to come near Swaminarayan Temple at Atladara to check the gold coins and beads. Khandelwal told police that he took two coins to verify their authenticity. On reaching home, Khandelwal rubbed the coins against a stone and found them to be original. He then called Jayesh showing interest to buy them and the duo met on April 19 to finalize the deal for Rs20 lakh.
 
 Jayesh came to Khandelwal’s shop on Saturday morning and both of them went near Chhani Jakatnaka in the latter’s car. Jayesh told Khandelwal that his sister and brother are waiting there with the bag containing gold coins and beads. When they reached there, Khandelwal again authenticated some of the gold coins and antique beads by rubbing them against a stone. On finding them to be original, he gave Rs20 lakh cash to Jayesh and went home.
 
 Police said on reaching home, when Khandelwal tried to establish the authenticity of all the gold coins and beads, he found them to be duplicate. Khandelwal then went to police control room with his complaint from where he was sent to Manjalpur police station where a case of cheating was registered.
