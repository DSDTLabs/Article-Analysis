 He said that Wednesday and Thursday evenings have been fixed for allottee grievances meeting. “The meeting will be held after 5 pm. It will be convenient for people, mianly office-goers,” said Batth.
 
 Official in the DTCP’s office have also been asked to maintain a logbook of visitors. Outsiders will be allowed to visit office only between 10.30 am and 1.00 pm.
 
 “If any visitors stays beyond the allotted time for any discussion, they will have to take permission from either DTP or assistant town planner,” said Batth. “Employees have also been asked not to leave office without taking permission from their superiors. Along with this, field officers will have to give complete details of their site visit, if any during the day time.”
