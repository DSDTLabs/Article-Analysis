Salem: As AIADMK leaders, including chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, participated in an one-day hunger strike in Chennai condemning the Centre for failing to set up the Cauvery Managament Board (CMB), similar protest has taken place in Salem and Erode on Tuesday.

 In Salem, Hundreds of AIADMK cadres headed by former minister C Ponnaiyan participated in the protest. 
 
 Speaking to reporters, Ponnaiyan blamed the DMK and Congress for not setting up the CMB when the apex court directed the then Congress government. “The DMK failed to put pressure on the Congress government. It was late chief minister J Jayalalithaa who notified the verdict in the government gazette. But now, the DMK is hiding this, and blaming us for not putting pressure on the central government,” he said.
 
 Ponnaiyan said his party has put enough pressure on the Centre whenever the need arised. “Both DMK and Communist party’s MPs did not protest in Parliament on the issue,” he said. He hoped the protest would make the Centre to set up the CMB at the earliest.
 
 In Erode, the AIADMK cadres headed by school education minister K A Sengottaiyan participated in the protest. Similar protest also took place in Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts.
