PATNA: The   has embarked on a drive to make its fund-raising scheme, ‘Ajiwan Sahyog Nidhi Abhiyan’ (ASNA), a success in the state. The fund generated through ASNA is divided into four equal parts and shared by the party’s block, district, state and central units.

 Under the scheme, if a prospective BJP member enrolling himself under ASNA contributes Rs 100, the money is shared equally by the block, district, state and central units. Depending on his or her choice, the person concerned has the option to contribute either Rs 1,000 or Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000. Once enlisted under ASNA, the members have to contribute this amount annually with tax-exemption benefits from income-tax (I-T).
 
 “ASNA was launched on February 11 this year on the occasion of 44th death anniversary of   founder  ,” said BJP state spokesman Suresh Rungta. A meeting of the BJP’s state office bearers, district presidents and candidates who had lost the 2015 assembly election was held here on Friday to review the progress made under ASNA. The implementation of other party programmes was also discussed in the meeting.
 
 BJP state president and Ujiarpur (Samastipur) MP Nityanand Rai, former deputy CM  , leader of opposition in state assembly Prem Kumar and other senior functionaries of the party attended the meeting.
 
 Rungta said although ASNA programme is taken up every year, the last time it was done was in 2012-13 when he was the party’s state in charge. “The programme could not be implemented in the intervening years owing to various elections,” he added.
 
 Rungta said he had raised Rs 2.5 crore under ASNA in 2012-13. “Today, the state BJP has around 78 lakh primary members, which means that the volume of the people willing to enrol themselves for the party under ASNA could be large, and, therefore, there could be big jump in the funds,” Rungta said.
