Krishnagiri: Even as political parties in Karnataka postponed the proposed statewide bandh on Thursday, a pro-Kannada outfit distributed water bottles to people entering the state from Tamil Nadu at Attibele near Hosur as a gesture to ease tension between people of both states amid ongoing tussle over the Cauvery Management Board. 

 Members of Karnataka Samrakshana Vedike gathered at Attibele, a border town in Karnataka, around 9am and gave water bottles to vehicle drivers, bus conductors, and passengers coming from Tamil Nadu. 
 
 Earlier, due to the proposed bandh in Karnataka demanding not to set up CMB, the Tamil Nadu police advised the commuters, vehicle owners to take care while plying between the states. However, at the last minute, the bandh was postponed.
 
 The vehicular traffic between the states was normal during the day.
