LUCKNOW: Back-to-back   in   and Bundelkhand have thrown up a   for the  . Even as the sequence of events in the latest case, which was reported from Firozabad on July 22, was being ascertained, it is the use of police uniforms in the crime which has left the investigators worried. 

 Disguising themselves as policemen, the kidnappers signal ‘high-value targets’ to stop before abducting them at gunpoint. It is believed that some hardened criminals who have connections in Madhya Pradesh are behind the act. While senior officials remained tightlipped about the investigation, they confirmed khaki had been used in the kidnapping of renowned glassware businessman Sanjay Mittal in Firozabad on May 19 and the Jhansi incident of July 13 in which bullion trader   and businessman Rahul Agarwal were abducted.
 
  In Sanjay’s case, a ransom of Rs 5 crore was demanded though he managed to escape from the clutches of kidnappers on the same evening. In the Jhansi incident, no demand has been made so far and police are yet to trace the duo. “Abduction is a highly sensitive crime so we cannot share all the details. Members of the gang were seen in uniforms and we are trying to find out if some gangs active in Bundelkhand, Chambal ravine and the bordering districts of Madhya Pradesh have reunited,” said inspector general of special task force, Amitabh Yash.
 
  In the latest case, Sanjiv Gupta, owner of a chain of restaurants who also lends money to other businessmen for commission, was abducted on Saturday when he was heading home. His car was found abandoned near a highway toll naka in Aligarh the next day. Home secretary (IPS) Bhagwan Swarup Srivastava said four teams have been constituted under SP Firozabad and special task force has also been put on the job. “Our priority is the safety of the two Jhansi businessmen and Gupta. We cannot share details of the operation,” said Swarup
