The concept of   is not new. Everyone has tried it, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and the Indians; they have been doing this since ancient times. The famous book,  , based on human sexual behavior, describes oral sex in detail. A chapter in this book, ‘auparishtaka’, is solely dedicated to the act of oral sex.
 
 Every sexual activity has its own pros and cons. Although oral sex is considered as an important part of sex life, the act varies from person to person. Here, we are listing a few facts of indulging in oral sex:
  
 
 
  
 A person who is already infected with STDs or HIV should avoid sexual contact with others. Indulging in oral sex with an infected person can lead to the contraction of STDs. The potential carriers of such diseases are vaginal fluids, semen, and even breast milk.
  
 Bleeding gums, lesions, and ulcers make the situation worse and also increase the chance of getting the disease during the course of oral sex. The virus and bacteria can also be transmitted through cuts, openings, sores, mucous membranes (mouth, anus, vagina) on the body.
  
 
 
  
 If you feel any symptoms of herpes, avoid any physical contact with your partner as herpes can easily be transmitted from genitals to mouth or vice versa.
  
 
 
  
 Exposure to gonorrhea infected vaginal or seminal fluids is the main cause of getting affected with this disease. Oral sex is often not listed as a cause for transmission of gonorrhea, but a rise in the number of cases worldwide has compelled experts to mark oral sex as a possible medium of its transmission.
