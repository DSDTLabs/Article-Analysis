ALLAHABAD: Seeking to clamp down on any violation of the Model Code of Conduct online, Allahabad police have roped in sleuths of the   (Information Technology) cell to keep a watch on social networking accounts being maintained by supporters of candidates who are contesting the  . 

 The move comes in the wake of a campaign launched by the supporters of mafia-turned-politician   om social media to garner more votes for him, after the former MP filed his nomination for the forthcoming Phulpur byelection recently. 
 
 SP (Crime) Brajesh Mishra said, "Police are monitoring social media sites like   and Twitter and have made it clear that those found violating the norms laid down by the Model Code of Conduct or posting any objectionable article, poster or photograph would be booked under appropriate sections."
 
 Mishra also said that while supporters could take to social media for campaigning for their leaders but if any article, poster or post is found hurting the sentiments of any religion, caste or community, the police would be taking strict action against them. 
 
 District election officials said that the objective of the exercise was to deter any anyone from posting anything abusive or inflammatory on social media, which could disrupt peace. 
 
 "There is a difference between abuse and criticism. People are free to criticise a political personality or party. But posting abusive content or vulgar and morphed pictures of leaders on social networking sites could be objectionable. We have chalked out parameters and monitoring the sites," said a senior police official on condition of anonymity. 
 
 After the promulgation of the Model Code of Conduct, the crime branch has not received any complaint about any objectionable content being posted on social networking sites by any political party, added the official.
