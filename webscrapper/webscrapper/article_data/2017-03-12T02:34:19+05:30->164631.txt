NEW DELHI: A students’ group from   celebrated the 120th death anniversary of   by launching a cycle rally, meant to go to several parts of the city on Friday and sensitise people about the ills of the dual school system — government and private — and the ways it kills opportunities for students from poorer backgrounds to get a seat in mainstream colleges.

 Renowned educationist Anil Sadgopal, a former teacher at Central Institute of Education, Delhi University, was also a part of the event, and he exhorted students to fight for their rights to the kind of education they desire. The students at the cycle rally said most of those coming from economically-backward backgrounds have fewer options in terms of higher education because of the dual school system. “Dual education system of private schools and government schools lead to inequality at the senior secondary level. Students from both schools have to fight for a set number of seats and most of the times, students from smaller private and government schools lose,” said Harish Gautam, a member of the  , a students’ group.
 
 He said the students later have to opt for the correspondence courses and the facilities available to them are negligible. “We either have few or no classes, the library facility is bad, the results are declared late, and there is generally discrimination among the students,” said Gautam. He pointed out that most students who are left out of the mainstream higher education system are more often than not first generation of learners in the family.
