PATNA: One   (35), a sugar cane juice seller, was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne criminals near Sarari power grid station under   police station area in Patna on Sunday.

 SHO of Shahpur police station   said the incident occurred when Chauhan was on way to Bihta, carrying a sugar cane juice machine. “The criminals fired bullet from a close range, killing Chauhan on the spot,” the SHO said, adding an empty cartridge of .315 bore was recovered from the spot. “The shooters fled from the spot soon after the incident. Raids are on to arrest them,” he said.
 
 The SHO added it was probably a case of revenge killing. “One   Nonia was murdered at   village under Naubatpur police station area on October 30 last year. Chauhan, who used to stay in a rented accommodation at Neora, was an accused in the case. It seems those linked to Kamal have killed Chauhan,” the SHO said.
 
 SHO of Naubatpur police station   said one K D Nonia (34), one of the seven named in Kamal murder case, was an associate of Chauhan.
