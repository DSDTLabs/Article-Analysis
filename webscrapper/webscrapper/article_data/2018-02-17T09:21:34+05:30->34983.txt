TURA: Coming down heavily on  ,   (NPP) president   on Friday accused the chief minister of selling "false dreams" and hiding real facts. 

 "Mukul says that I have not done my homework on roads in the plain belt areas of  . It is a known fact that the roads are in deplorable condition and he is selling dreams of NH-127 B, which is yet to become a reality. I am sorry for Mukul that he has failed to even do his classwork," Conrad said at an election rally at Dagal under Songsak constituency, where Mukul is pitted against NPP heavyweight Nihim D Shira. 
 
 "People from Congress are coming out in large numbers to join NPP because they are frustrated of his dictatorial attitude. In fact, many Congress leaders were fed up with him. Many veteran politicians from the Congress decided not to contest the election because they are not willing to accept defeat," he said, indicating that he expects the ruling Congress to be voted out in the February 27 election. 
 
 Addressing a series of rallies in Songsak and Rongjeng constituencies, Conrad attacked Mukul for branding him a 'memorandum MP'. "Dr Mukul, you are scared! You have no issues, so you are trying to go all out to say whatever you feel. Let me tell you that the memorandum submitted by me is in the interest of the people. I am concerned for my people and will continue to raise issues and concerns with the central government. This is my job," the Tura MP asserted.
 
 Conrad promised that the NPP would usher in a positive era in   if voted to power. "  have suffered a lot under Congress regime. It is time for the people to be conscious of their rights and vote for a government that would ensure them a secure, independent and conducive environment for growth and development," he said.
 
 "We as a party would ensure that the momentum of growth is not region-centric. We have charted out a strategic plan for holistic development of Meghalaya," he added.
