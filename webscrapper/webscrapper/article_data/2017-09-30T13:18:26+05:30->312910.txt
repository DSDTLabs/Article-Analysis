NEW DELHI: More than half of the residents in cities and towns feel there is some improvement in   in their neighbourhood in the past three years since the launch of the Swachh Bharat scheme, according to a survey done by an online social media platform.

 The survey was carried out by social media site LocalCircles. Responses were sought to 11 sets of questions and point to a positive impact in urban India.
 
  
  
 
 The big gap identified for focussed action is the functioning and role of municipalities who are key links in the Swachhprogramme. The lack of syncronisation between Swacch Bharat objectives and municipal action seems to bear out ancedotal experiences of city residents as garbage collection and disposal remains a problem and is perhaps a factor on the scheme losing some momentum.
 
 Accessibility of civic body councillors are no better. The survey found less number of people felt civic sense has improved after three years compared to last year.
