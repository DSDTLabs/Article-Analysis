 is clearly born to live up to his name. Not only is he creating records with the bat virtually every day, but also leading the Indian team to newer heights.

 
 
 
 The thumping win in the one-day series over South Africa in South Africa has never been achieved before by previous Indian teams with far more illustrious names than in this team. Not that those teams did not have self-belief and confidence, for they held their own, but were simply not able to deliver the knockout punch. For Kohli that knockout punch has come from his bowlers, who have bowled superbly throughout this tour and destroyed the South African batting.
 
  
  
 
 Even in the Test matches it was the first time that the Indian bowlers took all 60 wickets to fall. It was just the batting in the fourth innings of the first two Tests that was unable to measure up to the South African attack, that too mainly because the skipper for a change got out early.
 
 The new-ball bowlers have been superb and the spinners were such a joy to watch. To see the South African batsmen ducking under snorters from [Japsrit] Bumrah, [Mohammed] Shami,   has made all the years of doing the same and watching other Indian batsmen doing the same melt away. Now the ultra-short format is upon us. South Africa have a new skipper in JP Duminy, who is an experienced hand in this version of the game.
 
 The Proteas will be looking to salvage some face after the drubbing they have received in the one-day series.
 
 The T20 game can turn right around in a matter of deliveries and usually the team that holds its nerve comes out on top. For the Indians, coming to the last week of a long tour, there could be the danger of thinking about returning home to families and losing a bit of focus, but under Kohli that is less likely to happen. It's been a matter of pride and great joy to see the way this Indian team has played.
