Nagpur: With as many as 91 fresh faces in the House comprising 151 corporators, mayor Nanda Jichkar has introduced new seating arrangements for the general body meeting. The decision has been welcomed by most parties and corporators. 

 According to the mayor, the decision was taken to give the senior members due respect in the House. As per the new arrangement, the four columns of seats have been categorized into A, B, C and D. Senior corporators from all parties have been allocated seats in first rows across all categories. The seats in subsequent rows have been allotted to corporators as per their seniority — that, in effect means, the first-time corporators are given seats in last rows. Each corporators have been allocated card with seat number. 
 
 The decision was taken at a meeting held at the mayor’s office recently which was attended by party whips. 
 
 The purpose behind introducing the new seating arrangement was to bring in more coordination between party members and discipline in the House. 
 
 Independent and senior corporator Abha Pande said she was happy with the decision. “The arrangement will instill discipline among corporators when it comes to taking seats in the house,” she said taking a dig at people who were opposing the move. 
 
 Echoing Pande’s views,   corporator Manoj Sangole pointed out that the mayor knows the importance of the chair. “People are so sensitive about their position and chair that even a seat change disturbs them,” he said. 
 
 Another member, requesting anonymity, said, “Though late, the NMC has taken the right decision to allot front seats to senior corporators. The mayor has given party whips and party leaders their due respect.”
