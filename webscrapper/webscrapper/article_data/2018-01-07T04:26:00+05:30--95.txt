Ahmedabad: Chandkheda police, investigating the bobbitization and injuries to a sadhak at the Asaram Ashram in Motera, claimed the incident seems to be a suicide bid as the severed organ was found in the same store room — one day after the victim was found there — along a razor. The severed organ was not found during the first round of investigation and police had earlier said that it was found in a workshop, raising questions about the police’s version.

 Sudama Raut, 40, a native of Madhya Pradesh, who has been associated with various Asaram Ashrams in Gujarat and elsewhere for 15 years, was found unconscious on January 1 from a store room, with a blanket covering his body. Blood was streaming out from beneath the blanket when other sadhaks found him. He had with multiple injuries, including severe injuries to his neck. Police claim the bobbitization was found out only when Sudama was taken to Civil Hospital.
 
 A C Patel, the inspector of Chandkheda police station, said Sudama was given 14 stitches to his neck and it is unlikely that will speak for at least a week. “We have sent the razor, the blanket and other items from the spot for forensic examination. He added that it may lead to a conclusion about whether Sudama inflicted the injuries to himself,” he said, adding that reason for the incident can only be explained by Sudama as there is no eyewitness. tnn
