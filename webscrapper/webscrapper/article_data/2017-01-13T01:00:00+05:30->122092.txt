Mitika Sharma has entered a new phase in life. The actress, who tied the knot with actor  , recently became a mama to a baby boy.

 Mitika, best remembered for her role as   Sunayna in 'Devon Ke Dev... Mahadev', says, “He is just a few days old, but I already feel like he has become our universe. Mandar and I can’t imagine a minute without him. We still haven’t thought of a name, but call him a prince and a rockstar. In fact, he is very lucky for us. Soon after his birth, Mandar’s old TV show, 'Aladdin', in which he played the title role, has come up for a rerun.”
  
 She adds, “We honeymooned in Europe for hardly 10 days. Once our little one is few months old and can travel, we will go on a second honeymoon. I want to visit all the places we saw as a couple last year again. But this time, with our son.”
