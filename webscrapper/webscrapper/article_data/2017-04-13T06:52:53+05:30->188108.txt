KOLKATA: Did you know that Gerald   had come calling way back in 1978, and peered through Indian Museum’s galleries, seeking insights into natural history? Lee Durrell, his wife, did just that — among many other things — to relive the nostalgia inside the 203-year-old edifice on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The museum authorities were thrilled that the woman who best knew Gerald, his family and his “other animals” was dropping by. 
 
 Speaking to a rapt audience, the director of   reintroduced the author and founder of Jersey zoo (now the Durrell Wildlife Park). No one knew that Durrell sold his own sketches during this museum visit to garner funds for his zoo.
 
 Lee showed rare pictures of the author, from the time he was born to Tisco engineer   in Jamshedpur, to when he became the “icon of conservation”. 
 
 Durrell set up Jersey zoo in 1959 to house rare species; Lee said it had a figure of the Dodo of Mauritius at its entrance. The zoo’s now home to 120 species, over half of which are endangered.
 
 In 1977, a 28-year-old Lee (then Wilson) met the 52-year-old Gerald at   in North Carolina. “They say you should never meet your heroes. I not only met my hero, I also married him,” she laughed.
 
 Together, she and Gerald had co-authored several books, undertaken ventures to save species like the Mauritius kestrel and set up the Durrell Academy. 
 
 Though she admitted there was a footfall “trouble” at the Jersey zoo, Lee said, “We now have two restaurants and glamping, which are hugely popular. We’re not out of the woods, but I’d like to think people would never let us down.”
 
 Lee also talked about her husband’s “casual conservation” — “It’s conservation in your backyard,” she explained.
 
 Elegant in her own casual attire, she demonstrated why she made an excellent ambassa-dor for this particular brand of conservation.
