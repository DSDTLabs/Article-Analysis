Panaji: Keeping in mind the recent spurt in road accidents, the Goa police have decided to rope in close to 300 school children to create awareness about road safety through a five-day summer camp. 

 The programme, which commenced on Tuesday, will continue till May 6. 
 
 “If children are imparted traffic-related education at the right time, it will get imbibed in their minds and become a part of their life,” superintendent of police (traffic), Devesh Mahla, said, adding that the maximum road accident casualties in the country fell in the age bracket of 18 to 35 years. 
 
 Mahla also said that though the number remains high, the rate of road accidents on Goan roads have decreased by over six to seven per cent as compared to last year.
 
 Under the camp, a series of lectures are being conducted at Clube Gaspar Dias, Panaji, St Joeseph School, Calangute, and Ravindra Bhavan, Margao. 
 
 Knowledge on cyber safety and criminal laws will also be imparted to students and study material will also be provided.
