GURUGRAM: Police on Friday managed to trace the car that bumped into Veshakha Gulati’s taxi, an episode that led to her being robbed near the toll plaza on the   highway. 

 After facing initial hurdles, as the driver of the Gulati’s cab had noted down the wrong registration number of the car that had bumped into the taxi, police zeroed in on the accused by tracking a number from which a call was made to the police control room during the incident. Gulati, who claims a woman in the other car slapped and robbed her, had called the cops. It seems this woman, too, had made a call. 
 
 Police reached the woman’s house and questioned her for allegedly thrashing Gulati and snatching her bangle. TOI is withholding her name as the police haven’t yet named her in any of their case documents. 
 
 However, Section 379B (snatching by force) has been added to the FIR registered against the accused. 
 
 The police are also recording the testimonies of the toll employees who were present at the plaza on Thursday when the ‘accident’ happened to get a clear picture of what transpired between the two parties. Cops are also studying the CCTV footage gathered from the spot.
 
 Gulati and the woman she has accused of robbing her were supposed to meet the ACP (DLF) on Friday evening for verification of the complaint but the meeting was rescheduled for Saturday, informed SI Mahender Singh. .
 
 Gulati, who is traumatised by Thursday’s incident, claimed the cops took a long time to reach the spot. She alleged that an early intervention would have saved her from the agony.
 
 “If this incident can happen at the toll plaza with several people and vehicles around, one can imagine what will happen at the deserted stretches of the city,” Gulati said.
