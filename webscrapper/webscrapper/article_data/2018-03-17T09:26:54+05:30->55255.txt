AHMEDABAD: Most students exiting the CBSE class X board   were all smiles and said the   paper was a cakewalk and nothing came from outside the syllabus.

 An invigilator present at one of the CBSE examination centres said, “The majority of the students were happy after getting the question paper, many of them had finished the paper before time.”
 
 A student,  , said that the science paper was easy but lengthy. Most of the questions were from the textbook. Those student who had studied from the textbook would have found the paper too easy to write.
 
 “Today’s paper was easy. The questions with a twist, were quite similar to those asked in our school ‘s pre-board and periodic tests,” said  , another student.
 
 A subject teacher refusing to be quoted said that even an average student will find it easy and can score around 60% marks easily.
