KOCHI: Come Sunday, the indigenously built sea-plane will be ready for trial run in Kochi's backwaters. Godson D'souza, a BTech graduate and his father Shabel D'Souza built this six-seater seaplane in their welding workshop at   near Bolgatty.

 "It took us 20 days to build this craft. Only 30% of its body will touch water, and the remaining 70% will be above water level," said Shabel D'Souza. While the son designed the seaplane, the father and workers at their workshop built it.
 
 They have used the engine of a Maruti Omni, and it is capable of achieving a maximum speed of 100 km hour.
 
 However, it is not possible to operate boats at such speed in Kochi's backwaters. The seaplane has four gears and is fully air-conditioned. The seaplane weighs around one tonne. Airtight bows fixed on to the two wings help the craft to maintain its balance.
 
 "As the first step we built a prototype of a vessel using ACP sheet, and conducted a trial run. We found that the vessel was weightless and it did not sink. This gave us the confidence to build a seaplane using ACP sheet, steel frames and fibre coating," said Godson D'Souza. He also said his friend  , a naval architect, also helped them during the entire process of building the sea-plane.
 
 The father-son duo said after successfully completing the trial runs they can approach   and Ports departments to grant them permission for operating the seaplane in Kochi's backwaters.
 
 However, they are skepti cal whether permission would be granted to launch commercial operations. "We will not be able take tourists on it. We can use it ourselves or sell it. We are continuing our efforts to obtain these sanctions for taking tourists," said Shabel D'Souza.
 
 They also said that though they are keen about flying the craft they were not sure whether Indian Navy would give them permission. "We would like to take it at least 2m above the water level. All that will depend on permission from Navy," said Godson D'Souza.
