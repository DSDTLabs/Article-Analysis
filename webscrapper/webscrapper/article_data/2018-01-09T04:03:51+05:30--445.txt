NEW DELHI: It was another cold morning in the capital on Monday with mercury recorded at 5 degrees Celsius — two notches below average for the season. Delhi’s air quality, however, continues to improve and was recorded in the ‘poor’ category with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 289 on Monday — the lowest in the last seven days. Experts forecast mercury to stay low in the next few days, hovering around 4-5 degrees Celsius, Met officials said.

 Delhi’s Safdarjung observatory, which is taken as the base for weather in the capital, recorded a maximum temperature of 21.7 degrees Celsius on Monday. However, the minimum fell to 5 degrees Celsius during the course of the day – the second lowest recorded this season. Officials from Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) say mercury is likely to hover around a similar range on Tuesday as well with maximum and minimum temperatures recorded around 21 and 5 degrees Celsius respectively, Met officials said.
 
 “The fog intensity has reduced. Tuesday will see shallow to moderate fog during the day and visibility will improve by the afternoon,” said an RWFC official.
 
 The drop in temperatures has not stopped Delhi’s air quality from improving drastically in the last 48 hours.
