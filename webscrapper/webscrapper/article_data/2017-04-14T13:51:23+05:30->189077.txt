Directed by  , this 2 hour 40 minutes film, Mister, stars  ,   Tripati,   Patel,  , Tanikella Bharani in pivotal roles.

 Chai (Varun Tej) who lives in Spain with family falls in love with Meera(Hebah) whom he picks up at airport instead another. Chai, who vows to never visit his grandfather Pitchaiah Naidu( Nasser) living in   comes down to India under circumstances.
 
 He meets Chandramukhi (Lavanya) on the way and realises that he has to save her from goons for reasons that are yet to be revealed. Mister is a movie which has all director Sreenu Vaitla's trademark chases, comedy and side characters that involve in the flow of the narration. Seems like the director has not got over his past movies and incorporated elements that were tested by time and were boring already.  's music justified the movie's mood and complimented the excellent cinematography by K V Guhan.
 
 Varun Tej has tried a new role and tried hard to work comedy and kind of leaves the viewers impatient. With intense chasing and run-over-the mill comedy, Mister only comes out as a regular commercial fare until now.Both Lavanya and Hebah have nothing to do much.
 
  Let's see what happens in second half. Watch this space for more updates...
