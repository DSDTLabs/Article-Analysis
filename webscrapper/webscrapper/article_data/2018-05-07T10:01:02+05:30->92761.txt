CHANDIGARH: Residents of a   village on Sunday attacked a team of health officials, which had swooped down on the house of a woman who used to perform black magic for the birth of male child.

 The incident occurred when the team headed by deputy civil surgeon Prabhu Dayal conducted the raid on the house of Murti Devi, a resident of the village. Initially, the woman did not react. But later, her son and other villagers came and attacked the team. The team had to run for shelter in different directions until some other villagers came to their rescue. Dayal and his team members Dr Mahender Kumar, Sudesh Rani, Krishna, Sulekha and Subhash suffered injuries. They were admitted to a primary health centre of Assandh. Soon after getting the information, Karnal SP Surender Bhoria rushed to the spot. He said that a case had been registered against 15 persons.
 
 Meanwhile, as the information reached health minister Anil Vij, he reiterated action against those involved in the attack. “Such acts will be dealt with sternly. We have zero tolerance towards such people and the SP has been asked to take adequate action,” said Vij.
