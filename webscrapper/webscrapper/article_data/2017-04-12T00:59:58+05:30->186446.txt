Lucknow: Aiming to repair and cover about 5,000 damaged manhole points in the city, Jal Sansthan could repair only 105 points on Tuesday. The team cleaned sewage lines and repaired manholes in Rajajipuram, Jankipuram, Narhi, Vinay Khand and Vishesh Khand of Gomtinagar, Indiranagar and Niralanagar. 

 The drive was a non-starter on Monday owing to lack of preparations by Jal Sansthan officials.
