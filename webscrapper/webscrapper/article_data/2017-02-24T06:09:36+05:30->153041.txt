THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   has observed that the eight-month-old   is in a dormant state. The state is going through a situation where there is no governance and the people's issues are not being addressed. 

 Even there is no clarity on the policies of the government and if at all any decision is taken by the government then the constituents of the LDF are not happy with it, said UDF convener P P Thankachan after the meeting.
 
 The UDF convener said that there was no collective responsibility in the government and hence for every decision taken there is conflicting opinion within the LDF itself. Even the administrative reforms commission chairman   himself is criticising the style of functioning of the government.
 
 The feud among the IAS and IPS officers has started affecting the governance. Non-cooperation of IAS officers has badly affected the file movement in the secretariat.
 
 The people had high expectations when   became the chief minister but he has miserably failed in all fronts, said the UDF convener. 
 
 The UDF has decided to raise all the people's issues inside the   and not to disrupt the proceedings of the House. 
 
 The UDF leaders decided that all the anti-people policies should be brought before the House on each day.
