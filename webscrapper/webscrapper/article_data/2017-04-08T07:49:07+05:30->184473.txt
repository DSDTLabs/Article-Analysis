HYDERABAD:   detectives in Hyderabad conducted searches at the offices of two 'shell  ' in the city on Friday over fraudulent transactions done with the proceeds of bank fraud crime. Detectives raided offices of   at Barkatpura and   in Habsiguda on Friday and seized incriminating evidence. 

 During the investigation carried out into several bank fraud cases, the culpability of many 'shell companies' came to light. "The shell companies were not doing any genuine business. They were only accommodating receipt and transfer of funds which were mainly proceeds of crime. The owners of such shell companies are working with fraudsters to siphon off funds diverted from the banks through fraudulent means," a   official said.
 
 On Friday, the CBI conducted searches at the two shell companies involved in a bank fraud case (RC 5(A)/2016). "We seized incriminating documents indicating the role of the two shell companies in fraudulent activity for commission. These shell companies were the links for diversion of funds by fraudsters," said a CBI official.
