Three and half years of bifurcation of  , the two Telugu CMs are at different political crossroads. While   chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is firmly enconsced in his throne and pitching for a kingmaker’s role at the centre post-2019 elections, his counterpart N Chandrababu   is fighting for survival.

 Six months ago, the two CMs appeared to be in the same boat. Occasionally sparring on water sharing issues, they were both busy and in control of their state governments and things appeared hunky dory for both of them in the run-up to the next elections. But the last few weeks saw Naidu and   take different political paths, one downhill and the other uphill.
 
 In KCR’s case, he appears confident that the TRS will come back to power in 2019 on its own. Smug in that belief, he surprised one and all two weeks ago by announcing that he will float a federal front minus the BJP and the  . And within hours, he was in touch with other leaders like   CM Mamata Banerjee and the like. Now, he is slated to hop across the country and meet various leaders in his bid to open up a new political front.
 
 In contrast, Naidu’s house has been witnessing a stormy battle. Upstaged by YSR Congress president   on the Special Category Status issue for the last few weeks, he has been forced to up the ante with his ally BJP, which has now culminated in a cul-de-sac for him with rhe resignation of two TDP ministers at the centre and that of an equal number of the BJP from the state cabinet. Naidu now has to deal with issues on several fronts, like negotiating Jagan and the BJP politically, and ensuring that he has the confidence of the electorate in order to be re-elected to power. And on both these fronts, he is a bit shaky.
 
 Thus while one CM is looking at sunny days ahead, the other has to brace for trying times and aim to weather them through.
