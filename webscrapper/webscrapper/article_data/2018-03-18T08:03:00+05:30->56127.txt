GURUGRAM: An unidentified man has threatened to bomb State Bank of India’s Sector 23 branch and kidnap its manager apparently for refusing to transfer Rs 8.5 lakh from the account of an automobile dealer to that of an individual.

 Aditi, the manager of the   in Sector 23, alleged that she received a letter from an unknown man a couple days ago, threatening to transfer or even kidnap her if she did not follow his instructions.
 
 “I want you to transfer Rs 8,50,000 to the account (of Akash Chourasia). Otherwise, you get yourself transferred from this place. If the money is not transferred, your Sector 23 branch will be bombed soon, maybe next week. You can even be kidnapped. So transfer the money as per my instruction. Your well-wisher Pasco Gurugram,” read the threat letter.
 
 In her complaint to police, Aditi further said an official at her branch had received a call from a mobile number on March 9 and the caller claimed to be the owner of Pasco Automobiles, a car dealer. The caller then asked the bank official to transfer Rs 8.5 lakh from the account of Pasco to the account of Akash Chourasia. He promised to send a cheque for the same amount to the branch soon.
 
 “We had transferred the amount initially. But when despite our repeated calls the cheque was not deposited, we reversed the full amount from Chourasia’s account the same day. Later, we received a letter through post, wherein someone threatened to bomb the branch,” the bank manager told the police.
 
 An FIR has been registered against an unidentified person under Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC at Palam Vihar police station. “We have put the mobile number under surveillance and sought details of the two bank accounts in question,” said inspector Vikram Nehra, SHO, Palam Vihar police station. When contacted, Aditi refused to share any information about the incident. Pasco officials could not be contacted for any comment.
