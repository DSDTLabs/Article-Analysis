NAGPUR:   have seized mobile handset of   (30), learnt to be one of the biggest  , after he was nabbed with 1.5gm cocaine in crystal form, worth Rs4,000, at Dr   on Friday evening.

 The device has been sent to   to procure call data records. Even if Mishra has deleted messages or contact details, cops will be able to recover it. 
 
 On Saturday, Mishra was produced before court which remanded him to police custody. Cops feel they can bust the racket in a few days. 
 
 Mishra used to supply cocaine mainly in Hyderabad and Nagpur. He never supplied big consignment. On Friday too, the seized cocaine was in a small plastic pouch. It is probably a sample which Mishra had brought to show to a person whose identity he has not revealed, said cops. Mishra has no criminal record in city police stations but cops would check with their Mumbai counterparts too.
 
 Sources said it was not the first time when Mishra has brought cocaine here. Senior officials claimed Mishra has good contact with small peddlers in the city. Sources said the demand for cocaine has increased in the city as cricket bookies consume it while betting on IPL matches. Some high profile people too are Mishraâ€™s customers, said sources.
