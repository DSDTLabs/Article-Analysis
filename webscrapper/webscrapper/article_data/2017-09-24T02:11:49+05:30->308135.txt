 Jerks are everywhere and , a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, is somewhat of an expert on them. His 2007 book, The No Asshole Rule, was a bestseller. As his latest work, The Asshole Survival Guide: How to Deal with People Who Treat You Like Dirt, hits the shelves, he tells  why people are getting nastier       The last thing I ever intended was to become an expert on jerks. My expertise continues to be around leadership, innovation and organisational change. What happened was that in 2007 I wrote a short book called The No Asshole Rule. It sold like crazy and people from all over the world with asshole problems started writing me asking for help. CEOs talked about nasty boards and even priests and rabbis talked about nasty parishioners. By the time it was over, I had about 8,000 emails.    Another reason for doing the book was that between 2008 and 2016, I tracked a lot of academic literature related to assholes such as workplace bullying, pedestrian rage, and phubbing (where you ignore people and look at the phone instead) and got interested in the subject. The research showed that a bad boss, a hostile workplace or even being briefly subjected to rudeness is bad for you. It leads to long-term effects on mental health and affects productivity and performance.        There are various factors why people are being less nice. The more hurried and jammed together people are, the less civilised they are. Status and income inequalities bring out nasty behaviour as does sleep deprivation. I often joke that Donald Trump shouldn’t be allowed to tweet unless he’s been certified to have eight hours of sleep. Another reason is use of technology, primarily social media. Increasingly in workplaces, people don’t talk to colleagues even if they’re sitting in the same room and communicate through Slack instead.        First, there are circumstances in which being a jerk helps you get ahead but it doesn’t help the organisation. If you treat people like dirt, you make them sick and less productive and creative.    Now let’s come to Jobs. In the book, I talk about the Steve Jobs myth. First, there is a difference between being an asshole and being tough. Ed Catmull, who worked with Jobs at Pixar, told me that Jobs only became successful when he stifled his worst tendencies and became a team player.    The notion that you have to be an asshole to succeed isn’t true. Just look at Reed Hastings of Netflix whose company’s model is no assholes and no bozos. Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn is also a great guy. I think a great comparison is between Satya Nadella and Steve Ballmer. Ballmer was a toxic person and created conflict. Satya gets people to cooperate and collaborate. He’s a huge upgrade as Microsoft CEO.        When you’re dealing with someone who is making you feel demeaned, de-energised and disrespected — that’s how I define a jerk — you need to know your bully. I don’t have a formula but there are options. Getting out or transferring is the best thing. If you can’t do that, then there are some survival strategies. One is to avoid contact and exposure by sitting farther away and reducing email contact. Think of the bully in a way that makes him or her less damaging to you. Humour works. One of my friends who was hazed at West Point used to imagine that the people hazing her were comedians.    But don’t sink to the asshole’s level. As Michelle Obama put it, ‘When they go low, you go high.’ One of my favourite coping strategies is imaginary time travel or temporal distancing. If you’re having a bad day or bad week, you can reduce stress by imagining that it’s a week or year from now, and you are past this.        I certainly hope he doesn’t infect the entire country (laughs). And yes, if you surround yourself with assholes, you’re going to be more of an asshole. So people around Trump may be catching the disease. I’m not a Trump supporter but I am a patriotic American. John Kelly seems to be weeding out some of the assholes. He can’t fire the family members but there is some hope there.
