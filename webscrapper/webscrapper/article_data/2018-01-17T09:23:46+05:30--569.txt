CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday demanded that a criminal case be registered against   Singh’s for causing loss to the state exchequer. 

 Senior SAD leader and MP   said Rana Gurjit’s resignation had also proved that the entire process of allocation of sand mines was flawed. “All sand mines allocated to   legislators should be cancelled immediately. Action should also be taken against ministers who knew about this crime and kept quiet,” he added.
