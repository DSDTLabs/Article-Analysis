GUWAHATI: Three minor girls - identified as Sundori Begum, Mariyam Sheikh, and   - died and two others were injured in a devastating fire that broke out at the   in the   area on Monday night. Around 11 houses were also gutted in the fire which took fire fighters more than three hours to douse.

 "Family members said they thought they had rescued the children but they lost them in the chaos while trying to retrieve some items from the house," police sources informed.
 
 Eyewitnesses claimed that the fire broke out after midnight at the house where a rickshaw-puller, who goes by the name ' ', stays on rent. "He had a fight with the owner and he was supposed to vacate the house shortly. A few days earlier, he had even talked of taking revenge on the owner. So, we doubt his role in the tragedy," locals claimed.
 
 Police have also begun questioning locals though the rickshaw-puller could not be located. Police suspect that he might have fled the area and are trying to find him. Locals also claimed that the fire tenders also failed to reach the spot on time and by the time they managed to douse the fire, a lot of damage had already been done.
