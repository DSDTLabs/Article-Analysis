Chennai: A gear-shaped  , the symbol of prospective economic growth to be obtained through the unique concept of an industrial estate, today stands broken in the corner. Located opposite the Guindy bus depot, it is the only surviving one of the four such structures constructed about 60 years ago. 

 The decision to put up these vertical cement structures was taken days before the erstwhile Thiru-Vi-Ka Industrial Estate, brainchild of former chief minister K   and industries minister  , was set for a grand launch in 1956. At the time, the idea of an industrial estates was not heard by many in Asia. 
 
 The 400-acre plot was chosen to end unemployment and increase production capacity primarily through small-scale industries. 
 
 In the initial days, workers of the units who came from Pallavaram, Chromepet and parts of George Town feared attacks and theft from pilferers camping around Kathipara. Thus, streetlights were set up for the first time on the stretch connecting the estate with the main road and the pillars marked the entry to a ‘safe zone’. 
 
 Besides this, the pillars became one of the impromptu landmarks for anti-Hindi protests in the city. "In 1963, hundreds of people gathered in front of one of the pillars, blocking Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s entry to Madras from the airport 15km away. History was repeated when his daughter Indira Gandhi visited the city a few years later," said K V Kanakambaram, president of Industry Estate Manufacturers Association, who was part of these protests. 
 
 As the locality started to develop, no proper attention was given in preserving and saving these iconic columns. All that one can see now is a four-metre high structure which motorists find a hindrance to the smooth traffic flow.
