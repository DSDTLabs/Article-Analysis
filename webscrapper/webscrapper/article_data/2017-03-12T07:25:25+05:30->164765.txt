VISAKHAPATNAM: The union home ministry has sent the file pertaining to the delimitation of constituencies in   and Telangana to the PM’s office on Saturday, reliable sources said.

 Union Ministers   and M   had recently held consultations with officials of the home, law and legislation ministries on the issue of increasing the number of Assembly seats from 175 to 225 in AP and from 119 to 153 in Telangana. However, in reply to a question from MPs from the two states in the Lok Sabha recently, minister for state of home affairs Hansraj Gangaram had said there will be no delimitation of seats in AP and Telangana till 2026.
 
 CMs of AP and Telangana, Chandrababu Naidu and K  , have been pressing for the delimitation with the centre. It is in this backdrop that the union home ministry sent the concerned file to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Office, said the sources.
 
 According to former MP Sabbam Hari, the increase of Assembly seats was in the AP Reorganisation Act. He was confident that both the states would go for elections with the increase of Assembly seats in 2019. 
 
 According to political sources, if the delimitation does take place, then the number of Assembly seats would increase to 20 from 15 in Visakhapatnam district. Most probably, Chintapalli, Sabbavaram and Kotauratla may emerge as the new constituencies in the district, the sources said.
 
 Viziangaram district’s constituencies were reduced from 12 to 9 in the delimitation exercise in 2009. Now, the district may get two more constituencies. Likewise, Seethanagaram, Bobbili, Bobbili town or Makkuva mandal may be created as one constituency. Likewise, Srikakulam, which has 10 constituencies, may get two more in the delimitation. Most probably one constituency may come up at   area and the other one at Srikakulam town area, the sources said.
