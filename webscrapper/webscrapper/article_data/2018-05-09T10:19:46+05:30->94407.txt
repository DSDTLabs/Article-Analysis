CHANDIGARH: A key witness in the assassination of former   CM  , submitted a complaint to the police on Tuesday, alleging that the police constable posted for his security   at Punajb secretariat. 

 
 Though Punjab Police head constable   Singh has demanded the registration of an FIR against the constable, no such action has been taken by Chandigarh Police. Balwinder said the constable was missing from duty at the Punjab secretariat. When he asked him to come there, the cop came after an hour and started misbehaving with him, said Balwinder. "He also manhandled me and tore my uniform," he said.
 
 Balwinder phoned the police. After this, he was taken to  , Sector 16. Balwinder claimed that cops who were posted for his security earlier too had misbehaved with him and would come to duty under the influence of liquor. An official at the Sector 3 police station said they would carry out a thorough investigation before registering a case.
 
 Balwinder Singh was given a job in Punjab Police after he had given vital clues which led to the arrest of the conspirators in the case.
