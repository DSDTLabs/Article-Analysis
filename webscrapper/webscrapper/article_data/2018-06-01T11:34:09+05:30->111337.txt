SHIMLA: At least seven persons were killed and 20 injured when a   bus skidded off the road and rolled down a hill near   on Friday, the police said.

 Most of the injured have been admitted to the   and Hospital here.
 
 The bus was on its way to   from Shimla when the accident occurred on the   road, 42 km from here.

 The administration had a tough time extricating the victims from the badly mangled wreckage after the people in the area launched the initial rescue bid.
