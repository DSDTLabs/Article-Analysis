DOABA: It took 10 years for the   to perform better in Doaba region, which has given the party 15 out of 23 seats, with five going to SAD, one to BJP and two to AAP in the 2017 assembly results declared on Saturday.

 In 2012, the SAD-BJP alliance had got 16 seats while six went to the Congress and one to Congress rebel Rajnish Kumar Bubby from Mukerian, who joined the party later. This time, he contested and won as the Congress candidate. In 2007 also, the Congress lost Doaba region to the SAD-BJP combine. Last time, Jalandhar gave SADBJP all nine seats but this time the Congress won five in the district.
 
 The biggest loser remained the BJP, which lost all three urban seats in Jalandhar. The Akalis managed to win four rural seats of Nakodar, Shahkot, Adampur and Phillaur while Jalandhar Cantonment, a mix of urban and rural areas, was won by hockey Olympian Pargat Singh of the Congress by a big margin.
 
 However, in Hoshiarpur, the SAD-BJP lost all seven seats. While Sukhpal Singh Khaira of AAP won from Bholath by defeating former SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur's sonin-law Yuvraj Bhupinder Singh, the surprise victory for the party came from Garhshankar, where party candidate Jai Krishan won. The only saving grace in Doaba region for the BJP was Phagwara, where sitting MLA Som Parkash defeated Congress's Joginder Singh Mann.
 
 In Kapurthala district, Congress retained both seats of Kapurthala and Sultanpur Lodhi. The Congress faced a rebel in its sitting MLA Tarlochan Soondh from Banga, who could get just 6,234 votes while the party candidate Satnam Singh Kainth also trailed at the fourth position with just 11,874 votes.
