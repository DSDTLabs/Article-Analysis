CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday reserved its verdict on the plea filed by   Singh, former driver of   (DSS) chief  , for recording his statement afresh in Ranjit Singh murder case.

 Justice Augustine George Masih reserved the verdict after hearing all the parties, including   and the rape convict dera chief. While CBI had supported Khatta’s plea, dera chief has strongly opposed it.
 
 Khatta had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court against the orders of special CBI court Panchkula that had dismissed his plea to depose against DSS chief in the ongoing murder case.
 
 In his appeal, Khatta had submitted before the HC that his statement was very crucial for the cases and he had given several grounds to show his bona fide as to why he resiled from the earlier statements being under threat from Gurmeet and his henchman.
 
 He had also stated that the only reasons given by the special CBI judge for not permitting him to recall his statement, was that the trial of the case was pending for more than 10-years and now the case is on the final stage of argument.
 
 On September 25, 2017, special CBI judge Jagdeep Singh had dismissed his application finding no merits in his plea. Khatta, who retracted his statement in 2012, had approached the special CBI court after dera chief’s conviction in rape cases, seeking permission to record his statements afresh regarding Gurmeet’s role in the murder cases.
 
 According to Khattar, he had changed his testimony earlier due to threat from the dera head and his goons and not CBI.
