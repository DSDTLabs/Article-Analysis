CHENNAI: Vegetable prices have registered a steep fall at the Koyambedu wholesale vegetable market, thanks to excess rain brought by the northeast monsoon over the southern peninsula. Price of sambar onion has fallen from Rs 160/kg to Rs 35/kg since November, while the price of tomato reduced from Rs 20/kg to Rs 8/kg. Traders at the market said that the fall in price will persist for three more weeks till the second crop of the year comes along.

 Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association president  , who is a tomato trader, said, “Usually, we receive 400-450 loads of vegetables daily. But now we are getting nearly 550 loads.” Yield from the first crop of the year (December – January) is usually the highest due to cold weather and availability of excess water. Price of vegetables is set to gradually rise with the arrival of the second crop from February 20.
 
 Water-rich vegetables like turnip (nookal), radish (mullangi), chayote (chow chow), beetroot, okra (vendakkai), snake gourd (pudalangai) and white pumpkin (poosanikkai) are now priced at Rs 5- Rs 10. Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar said, “Foreign (non-indigenous) vegetables like cabbage, carrot, and capsicum require a greater amount of water to grow as compared to the local varieties. Price of these vegetables has fallen thanks to an excess rainfall.”
 
 According to traders, the first crop yield is 100kg per acre while second crop (February-March) yield is only 50kg/acre. The wholesale price of vegetables like nookal and mullangi was Rs 5, while their retail price was Rs 10 on Monday.
 
 The price of tomato fell gradually since November 2017. Sukumar said, “In November, the price of tomato was Rs 20/kg. It fell to Rs 15 in early December and by the end of the month, it was Rs 10. Now the price is Rs 8.” Only the price of drumstick (Rs 50- Rs 60/kg) has remained stable since November 2017.
