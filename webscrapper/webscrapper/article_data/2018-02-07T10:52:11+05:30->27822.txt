SHILLONG: The Meghalaya Pradesh Congress Committee ( ) welcomed   to the party on Tuesday at   here. Chaudhuri had resigned from the BJP on Monday after not getting a ticket for the upcoming assembly election. 

 A visibly happy Chaudhuri said the felicitation programme felt like a 'ghar waapsi' for him, sans the religious activities. "This was a different kind of ghar waapsi," said Chaudhuri, who will now contest the South   constituency on a Congress ticket. Chaudhuri had earlier the quit Congress in 2016 to join the BJP last year. Speaking at the felicitation ceremony, Chaudhuri recalled the lessons he has learnt in politics and how he thought he would not contest again after the 2013 setback. 
 
 Saying a section of people is feeling "very scared", Chaudhuri called upon Congress leaders to devise a method to erase such fears. He also urged Khasis and non-Khasis to take up an united fight against this fear. "We need to have an alert administrative machinery to bring a sense of protection and take action against those who violate the election code during polls," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, MPCC working president and Shillong Lok Sabha member Vincent Pala guaranteed Chaudhuri a ministerial berth if he wins the election from the South Shillong assembly constituency, where he will be pitted against the new BJP entrant Sanbor Shullai, who had been a sitting legislator from the seat until he recently resigned from the assembly to quit the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and join the saffron brigade.
