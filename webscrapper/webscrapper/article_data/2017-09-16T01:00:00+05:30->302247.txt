Last week, we had told you about Delhi-based   Mohit Suri, who was heading to South Africa to represent India in the Commonwealth  . The 43-year-old has won medals in all the three competitions he participated in - gold in powerlifting (Masters, 93kg), silver in equipped bench press (Masters), and silver in classic bench press (Open).

 
  
  Our story in DT about Mohit and his plans to win big at the Powerlifting Championships
 
  Speaking to us over the phone from South Africa, a jubilant Mohit said, "It was a great experience competing and winning at this level. I was confident to do well, but nervous too, as I was competing at this level for the first time. I'm glad that I managed to win a medal in every competition I participated in." Mohit added that while the two Masters category medals were quite special, the silver in the open category was sweeter. "In the Masters category, you are competing with athletes of your own age - 40 and above. But in the open category, you are up against everyone, including younger and stronger guys. So winning there is sweeter," he said. 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  Mohit is still in South Africa and will return to India with the Indian contingent on Tuesday. But he is wasting no time and has already begun prepping for the next medal. He said, "I'm already back in the gym and working out. We have set our sights on the Asian and World Championships now. Let's see how that shapes up."
