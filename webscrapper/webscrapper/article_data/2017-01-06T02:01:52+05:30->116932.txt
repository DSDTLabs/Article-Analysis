NOIDA: The   candidates for all the three seats of Noida, Dadri and Jewar of Gautam Budh Nagar district are likely to be announced by January 10. 

 A list of three probable candidates from each seat has been sent to party general secretary UP incharge   in Lucknow.
 
 Azad met district Congress president   among other district presidents at a meeting held in Lucknow on Wednesday. The probable candidates include Rajendra Awana, Ramesh Chandra Sharma and   from Noida; Mahender Singh Nagar, Jile Singh Bhati and Ashok Sherwat from Dadri; Manoj Chaudhari, Ajeet Daula and Yogendra Nagar from Jewar.
 
 According to Nagar, the final list will be announced by January 10. “Surveys were conducted in the past three months. Some names have been chosen on the basis of feedback of people,” Nagar said. Congress, though not in power in any of the three assembly seats, has been gathering support from farmers and other rural communities of the region.
 
 The pre-election campaign by Congress has gathered momentum in the rural regions of Gautam Budh Nagar. On Thursday, party’s district representatives raked up the issue of demonetisation and its impact on farmers at a rally held in Dadri, attended by over 400 people.
 
 “We are highlighting the need for a secular and pro-people political leadership in rural areas like Dadri and Jewar,” Nagar said.
