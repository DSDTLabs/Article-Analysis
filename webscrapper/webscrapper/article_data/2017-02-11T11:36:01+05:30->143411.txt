VISAKHAPATNAM: Sadguru   is planning to set up   along the city coast and the district administration has reportedly identified 200 acres of land in Kummaripalem near Bheemili for the purpose.

 According to sources, the AP government had proposed to allot around 400 acres of land near Mulapadu in Vijayawada after the Coimbatore-based foundation expressed interest to set up spiritual institutions in the capital region. However, the proposal hit a roadblock after the opposition protested against it. Eventually, the foundation decided to set up the institutions in the port city.
 
 “The proposal is yet to be finalised by Isha Foundation. The representatives may visit the site next month before taking any decision,” a senior revenue officer told TOI. 
 
 According to the sources, the proposed land at Trilochanapuram in Ibrahimpatnam mandal, 22 km off Vijayawada, is rich in flora and fauna and belongs to the forest department. Hence, the foundation did not want to attract any controversies and decided to focus on Vizag. 
 
 As part of the proposal, the foundation will develop an ashram as well as an international school for corporate law, leadership academy, and an art and craft institute. 
 
 “Once   sets up its institutions in the city, more and more VIPs, VVIPs and industrialists from various sectors will visit Vizag. This will help us get more funds for the development of various sectors,” a revenue officer opined. 
 
 When contacted, district collector Pravin Kumar confirmed that Isha Foundation is willing to set up institutionsbut added that they have not yet submitted the final proposal. “We are ready to accommodate the spiritually-oriented institutions if the government gives the green signal,” he added.
