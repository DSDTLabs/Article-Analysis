Hyderabad: The ‘City of Pearls’ is all set to play a key role in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push for a cashless economy with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organization for all retail payment systems in India, all set to make Hyderabad its hub.

 NPCI will be setting up its office and data centre in the city, NPCI chairman Balachandran Muthusamy said here on Tuesday.
 
 “The state government has allocated three acres of land at Gachibowli. We have taken possession of the land and are taking to architects. In the next three months, construction is expected to begin and the structure is expected to be ready in the next two years,” Muthusamy said. NPCI operations are currently scattered across several cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, where it operates a data centre in a leased facility that is manned by around 300 staffers. “We would like to bring all operations… such as technology, risk management here and our prime data centre will be here,” he added. Overall, NPCI has 1,200 employees. Once the dedicated Hyderabad centre is up and running, NPCI will try to shift some of its existing employees to Hyderabad. Overall, in the next five years, the Hyderabad centre will employ over 3,000 people, Muthusamy added. Explaining various activities of NPCI, he said, its activities range from inter-bank ATM operations, instant mobile payment system (which has become UPI now), RuPay card related work. It has also been working in the area of National Automated Clearing House (NACH) and Aadhar enabled payment system, among others. Talking about the BHIM app, he said that around 3.5 million downloads have been registered till now. This apart, the Bharat QR Code has been launched recently which offers a scan and pay option and will also boost the digital payments ecosystem in the country, he added.
