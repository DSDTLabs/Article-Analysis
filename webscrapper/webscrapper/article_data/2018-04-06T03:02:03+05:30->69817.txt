ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Indian high commissioner   on Wednesday met Pakistan's national security advisor   and raised India's concerns over crossborder terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir, besides discussing ways to improve strained bilateral ties.

 
 Sources in New Delhi said the issue of cross-border terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir was raised by the high commissioner in the meeting. Bisaria is understood to have also mentioned about the three encounters in Shopian and Anantnag districts of Kashmir earlier this week in which 13 militants were killed. In a statement, the NSA Office in Islamabad said that Pakistan is committed to resolve all outstanding issues through comprehensive dialogues.
 
 Janjua expressed "serious concerns over the ongoing human rights violations" in Kashmir and he said that "the use of force alone can lead us no where. It rather diminishes hope, injures the society and further worsens the fragile situation," the NSA statement added.
