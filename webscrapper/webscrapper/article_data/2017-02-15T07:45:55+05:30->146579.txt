KOLKATA:  , who was arrested from Delhi on Monday in connection with the death of businessman  , accused of attacking Kalighat trader   and his wife, faced interrogations by the police on Tuesday. 

 The Kolkata police, on getting his remand, flew Singh to Kolkata from Delhi on Tuesday night. 
 
 According to sources, the police are trying to recreate the sequence of events on Saturday night when Narendra Jain and his wife Sarala were attacked by  , who was subsequently found murdered at a lodge in Howrah. "Singh has been trying to misguide us about the motive behind Bordoi's death. It is difficult to believe that Bordoi, who attacked the Jains, would give up his life so easily, without a fight," said an officer. The cops are investigating if Singh had convinced Bordoi to have a drink with him and had spiked his alcohol.
 
 Police sources said the injuries Bordoi's hand hinted that he had attacked the Jain couple with a knife. CCTV grabs, capturing Bordoi at the Howrah lodge, also showed a bandage on his hand. A source claimed Bordoi might have hired Singh to attack the Jain couple who allegedly owed him money. After the assault, when Singh later met Bordoi at the Howrah lodge, asking for his share, an altercation might have broken out, leading to the murder, the source added. 
 
 Bookmakers at the racecourse claimed they had never before seen Singh, while Bordoi was often often found with Jain at the ground.
