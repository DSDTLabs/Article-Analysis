PANAJI: Following recommendations of the   (GSHRC), the state government has paid a compensation of Rs 5,000 to a complainant who was illegally detained and assaulted by   Dattaguru Sawant of Valpoi police station in June 2012. 

 After hearing the case in August last year, the rights panel had recommended that the state government, through its chief secretary, pay Rs 5,000 as compensation within 30 days to the complainant for illegal detainment and violation of his basic human rights.
 
 The GHRC inquiry report stated that the complainant had to “suffer mental torture on account of the high-handedness of the police who had apparently misused their powers by curtailing the liberty of the complainant without any justification” and had issued notices to the chief secretary, SP (North) and Sawant.
 
 The complainant, in his affidavit, had stated that he was returning from   along the Dabem road at 8 pm in June 26, 2012 when he saw a small gathering of people. 
 
 Upon enquiry, he learnt that an accident had taken place involving a four-wheeler and a scooter. Incidentally, the man on the scooter happened to be his friend. 
 
 He later received a call from his friend, asking him to release him on bail. After reaching the police station, he was allegedly abused physically and locked inside the jail. 
 
 The commission stated that there was nothing in record to suggest that the complainant was in a position to create a law and order problem and that it was apparent that the Valpoi police arbitrarily invoked provisions of Section 151 of the Criminal Penal Code, against the mandate of law.
