MANALI: The strategically important 474km-long Manali-Leh highway, which was closed for vehicular movement since November following snowfall, has reopened. A BRO official said on Sunday that snow had been cleared from the entire stretch of the highway late on Friday.

 “The highway is ready for traffic. This time we made this nearly two weeks in advance,” 38 Border Road Task Force (BRTF) commander   said. He added that they had to cut through 10-40ft of thick snow and ice to achieve this target. “Snow depth at   is still 10-25ft. We had to clear snow from Rohtang and Baralacha multiple times. The fresh snowfall was undoing our works.”
 
 The BRO had started its snow clearance operation in multiple stages after organizing puja near the Beas nullah below Rohtang pass on March 12. This year the passes received less snow in winter months but many spells of snowfall in April and May have affected its work. The spring months experienced very heavy snowfall.
 
 Awasthi said the BRO would continue working on the highway to improve its surface conditions. “We are building new bridges. Most parts of the   road have been widened. Remaining portions are also being widened and carpeted,” he added. The ministry of defence is planning to build tunnels below all passes to make Manali-Leh highway an all-weather road. Snow between Leh and Sarchu was cleared by the   (GREF) under project Himank a few days back. Now, the engineering force under project Deepak too has cleared road from Manali till Sarchu. The Army has started stocking essentials at its transit camp near Manali and will now move towards  . 
 
 Removing snow from Rohtang and Baralacha is difficult than other passes as both receive more snow and are prone to landslides and avalanches.
