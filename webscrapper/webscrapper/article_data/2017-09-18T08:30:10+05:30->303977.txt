Hyderabad: While public fury and TOI's sustained campaign against bad roads spurred officials to repair some stretches in the city , an inspection of the roads shows that they once again wear a bare-bone look. In fact, three arterial roads are in a pathetic state, just weeks after being worked on.

 The Koti-Jambagh Road, Chintalkunta Checkpost road and Basheerbagh Road were laid this month following TOI's campaign. But after rains battered the city in the past week, the roads have become pothole-ridden. Laid six months ago, the   road is also in a deplorable state.
 
 Re-carpeted on September 1, it appears as if all the effort put into the Chintalkunta road were just washed away . “We felt happy after this road, which had been in bad shape for years, was repaired, but the road has not been able to resist two spells of rains,“ said Sandeep Rao, a staff member at a private hospital in  .
 
 Defending the GHMC, K Vijay Krishna, deputy commissioner, LB Nagar circle, said, “We were unable to complete the restoration work completely due to the drainage work, resulting in potholes. Once the drizzling stops, the road will be repaired completely . Most probably we will take up restoration work this week on a sunny day .“
 
 The stretch of road connecting Koti to   division under the   pillar, recarpeted on September 4, is also in a bad shape. The repair work here was carried out by Metro Rail authorities. “We have asked   to restore the road as it was dug by them. They said that the road would be restored after monsoon,“ said Venkat Narayana, deputy executive engineer of central zone GHMC.
 
 Attacking what he thought was cause for poor roads, a commuter, said, “Imposing fines on faulty contractors is the only way to ensure better roads.“
