After the celebrated wedding of Indian cricketer   with British model-turned-actress  , it seems as if the next one on the cards is none other than his long-standing friend and former India fast bowler  .

 Both made their debuts in the ICC Knockout Champions Trophy in the year 2000 and are said to have shared a strong bond over the years. During Yuvraj's wedding, Zaheer was spotted at the occasions accompanied by Bollywood actress  , who made her debut in the 2007 blockbuster "Chak de India". Ever since, rumoured reports of a relationship between the two have been doing the rounds.
 
 It was first teased by Rohit Sharma, who congratulated Yuvraj and Hazel on their wedding and tweeted: "Brotherman down! Best wishes to my older brother @YUVSTRONG12 ! All eyes on @ImZaheer now."
 
  
  Speculations continued to grow with Zaheer praising Sagarika's latest movie "Iraada" on twitter. However, it was this particular reply from Yuvraj that seems to have dropped a massive hint. "All the best @sagarikavghatge for tonight remember u from the days when u dated a v c of the Indian team good choice not do it in real life," Yuvraj's tweet read.
 
  
  Zaheer knows a thing or two about dating a Bollywood celebrity. For years, Zaheer was rumoured to be in a relationship with dancer/actor Isha Sharvani. Even though neither accepted it openly, Isha confirmed their breakup in 2012. "I am single today. Yes, we were together for many years. But it is all over between Zaheer and me now," she said. "I don't want to talk about that... it is way too personal and something that should remain between two people. It is not right to wash dirty linen in public. We respect each other."
