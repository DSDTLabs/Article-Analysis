GAYA: Altogether 14 children in the age group of 8-13 years were rescued from two different places in Gaya on Sunday. While four   were rescued from Gaya station early in the morning, 10 others were rescued from two different residential premises in the Kotwali police station area of the town by the police and Ek Kiran, an NGO working in the field of child labour and human trafficking.

 Ek Kiran’s chairman Ritu Priya and director   said four children were spotted at the railway station early Sunday morning. They were being taken to Jaipur for bangle making. The agent, however, managed to escape. The children told their rescuers that several other children were also locally engaged for bangle making near the Falgu bridge.
 
 The police then raided these premises and rescued the child workers. “After proper counselling, the rescued children would be kept in two child shelters in the town,” said Manoj. Separate FIRs have been registered in the GRP and Kotwali police stations.
 
 This is the second rescue operation undertaken by the police and the NGO. Earlier on Thursday, seven child workers aged between 8-12 years were rescued from the Gaya railway station. Four of the children were being taken to Delhi and three to Himachal Pradesh.
 
 Gaya DM Kumar Ravi said he has asked the   officials to take effective steps for eradication of child labour. “The officials have also been asked to book the offenders engaged in promoting and facilitating child trafficking,” the DM added.
