The traffic police officials said a special drive was conducted on Thursday, wherein 22 buses of different schools were checked and 10 issued challans.
 
 In the erring buses, none of the 10 drivers were in uniform, four were not carrying the registration certificate (RC), five didn’t have insurance, some lacked reflectors and CCTV cameras.
 
 SHO (traffic) inspector Suresh Kumar told the TOI that during inspection, he was shocked to find a minor driving the bus of British School, and when asked about the licence and age proof, he failed to produce it. The young driver told cops that his father was unable to come on duty, so he sent him. The SHO said, “We have issued a challan to the driver for not carrying licence and endangering the lives of children.”
