HYDERABAD: Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) will soon call for tenders for selecting contractors for upkeep of metro stations and creating and maintenance of parking lots on Metro rail corridors. The state government on Tuesday issued orders to this effect.

 The proposed Integrated Smart Parking Management System (ISPMS), to be executed in a public private partnership ( ) mode, aims to provide parking areas for two and four-wheelers at street level near 24 Metro stations on the   stretch. It would have user-friendly features such as a digital payment system.
 
 In order to ensure viability of ISPMS, the concessionaire (contractor) would be allowed to commercially exploit advertisement space at parking bays and collect a parking fee, as approved by HMRL, from commuters.
 
 According to the GO, in a bid to recover capital expenditure, prevent recurring costs and encroachment of street spaces,   managing director NVS   had also proposed selecting concessionaires for operating and maintaining service roads, sidewalks, intermediate footpaths, public spaces, bus bays, two and four-wheeler parking bays, auto zones and streetscaping developed by HMRL at station precincts.
 
 As per the revenue model prepared by HMRL authorities and approved ‘in principle’ by the government, the concessionaire would be allowed to construct bus shelters, kiosks and generate revenue through rentals and advertisement space.
 
 “HMRL has completed street-level works at 24 stations. We had prepared two schemes for selection of licencees/developers for maintaining already created facilities and development of new facilities and parking areas. Government has approved the schemes and the request for proposal (RfP) documents prepared by HMRL and issued two orders. Tenders will be invited soon by HMRL as per these GOs,” Reddy added.
