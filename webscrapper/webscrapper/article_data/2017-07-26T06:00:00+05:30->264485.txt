Behrampore: A day after the judgment in the   killings case, the family of murder victim Pinky Sarkar, who was from Bengal’s Murshidabad, expressed relief at the verdict.

 “After several judgments went against us, we were losing hope and feared that the influential duo of Moninder Singh Pandher and Surinder Koli could ‘manage’ the investigating agencies. Yet, we kept faith in God and prayed that Pinky would get justice. I hope Pinky’s soul will rest in peace,” Pinky’s aunt Geeta Sarkar said from their tiled-roof home in Behrampore’s Gandhi Colony.
 
 Pinky’s father Jatin had died mysteriously on September 1, 2007 while trial was on. His body was found floating near the banks of the Bhagirathi near Gandhi Colony six months after he returned home from Nithari after receiving Rs 5 lakh as compensation.
 
 Pinky’s mother Bandana had then alleged that some senior CBI officials had made frequent threat calls to Jatin from two numbers. Murshidabad district police had declared Jatin’s death accidental.
 
 Bandana, who then went to Delhi in search of a job, told TOI over the phone: “We returned to Behrampore hoping to live peacefully. But after losing my husband, I changed my decision. I feared having to answer embarrassing questions about Pinky from neighbours and friends at Behrampore. But all along, I hoped the culprits would be punished. I left for Delhi with my son Bablu, then 10 years old. I planned to educate him but poverty came in the way. He is now 20 and a taxi driver.”
 
 She added: “I am overwhelmed that we finally received justice. Not only Pinky’s soul but the souls of all the innocent victims will now rest in peace.”
