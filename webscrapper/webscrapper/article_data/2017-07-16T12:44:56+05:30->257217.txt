INDORE: Undeterred by their blindness and undaunted by the recent terror attack, 10 visually impaired pilgrims set out for the   on Saturday.

 The batch of 16 has a physically challenged person and three women, apart from a doctor to handle emergencies. The pilgrims will have five escorts and guides — and their faith — to help them navigate the arduous journey.
 
 “This weeklong pilgrimage has been organized with a view to give these blind people the inspiring experience of visiting the holy place. We will be back by July 22,”  , the group leader, told TOI just before the   chugged out at 12.35pm.
 
 But how did this unique idea come about? “One of our donors, 47-year-old Om  , who lost his legs in an accident, asked us if we could arrange a pilgrimage for some blind members,” said Kaswalia. “We were moved and decided to make it happen.”
 
 The pilgrims were thrilled. Even the July 10 terror attack, in which seven pilgrims were shot dead and a dozen wounded, wouldn’t faze them. “Initially, we did get scared on hearing of the shooting. But we decided to go on the pilgrimage. A terror attack cannot stop us visiting Amarnath Shrine — a place known to be the biggest example of communal harmony in Kashmir,” said  , one of the blind members of the group. “Though we won’t be able to see the deity, we wish to at least get a feel of the holy place to attain inner peace,” he added.
 
 G D Singhal, another member of the group, said he wasn’t going to be deterred by terrorists. “I have had this wish for seven to eight years to visit Amarnath and am not going to back down,” he said. He and his wife Shanti Devi left with the group on Saturday. “We want to prove that physical disability cannot be a reason to not offer prayers to Lord Shiva,” said Singhal.
 
 After reaching Jammu, they will be going to Baltal by road, and from there they will fly to Amarnath by helicopter.
