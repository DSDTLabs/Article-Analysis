NAGPUR: A three-judge   bench has admitted a special leave petition filed by   on Monday challenging the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court’s order that had set aside the vice-chancellor SP Kane and registrar Puran Meshram’s decision to delete names of two teachers from the electoral list during the Board of Studies (BoS) elections in November 2017.

 The apex court bench, comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice DY Chandrachud, has issued notices to Maharashtra higher and technical education department principal secretary, Jawaharlal Nehru College of Arts, Commerce and Science, Wadi, through its principal ( ), Manisha Bhatkulkar and Arun Deore (both from the same college).
 
 On October 5, the NU registrar had passed an order deleting the names of Kongre and Bhatkulkar from the list and replaced them with Rajendra Wanare and Arun Deore, respectively, after objection was raised by the latter. The aggrieved teachers had moved the high court challenging the name deletion.
 
 On November 24, the NU had to postpone the elections for two Board of Studies – chemistry and zoology – after it lost the high court battle against Kongre and Bhatkulkar. The HC had directed the NU to include the names of Kongre (chemistry) and Bhatkulkar (zoology). They had submitted before the court that the VC had dismissed their appeal without considering the submission and decided the seniority without having any authority. The teachers had also alleged that they were not given the copy of objection and the order was passed without any hearing.
