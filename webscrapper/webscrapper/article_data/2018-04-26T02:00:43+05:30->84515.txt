NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force has formed “Alpha” team to track and nab pickpockets in metro trains. Another team, christened “Foxtrot”, has been set up for women's safety. Though the primary mandate of   is to secure metro’s trains and premises, over the last few months, the force has started focusing on deterring crime to create an atmosphere of safety for passengers. 

 CISF has formed 24 flying squads that travel in the trains and keep vigil through Delhi Metro’s operating hours.
 
 “We have formed 10 Alpha teams to catch pickpockets in trains,” a CISF official said, adding: “We have a database of suspected pickpockets and if we see them travelling in the metro while monitoring the live feed from CCTV cameras, the alpha teams are activated,” he said. Most of these security personnel operate in plain clothes. “This way, pickpockets can’t identify them while they mix with the crowd,” he said. The pickpockets caught by the alpha team are handed over to the   Rail Police for further action.
 
 Another flying squad, named  , focuses on making travel safer and comfortable for women travellers. “The teams keep a check on unruly behaviour. If anyone is found misbehaving with a woman passenger, they are apprehend and handed over to police,” he said.
 
 As part of ‘Operation Kali’, CISF has apprehended and deboarded 482 men between January and February for travelling in coaches reserved for women. 
 
 CISF has also intensified late-night patrolling at “blind spots” at stations. “CISF tries to act proactively to ensure that crime is kept at a minimum in metro trains and stations. That is why we have formed these teams to prevent crime on metro premises. It creates an environment of deterrence for anti-social elements and prevents crime,” the official said.
