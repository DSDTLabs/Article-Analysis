MYSURU: Starting with the next election, marker pens will replace the   at polling booths to mark the index fingers of voters. In practice since 1962, these bottles will last be used for the Nanjangud and Gundlupet assembly bypoll. 

  For the election here,   and Varnish Limited supplied 1,100 bottles of indelible ink, each containing 10ml of ink. Each bottle, which costs Rs 142, suffices for nearly 1,500 voters. Indelible ink is used to mark a voter's finger after the ballot is cast, to avoid fraudulent and multiple voting, and other malpractices. Once applied on the nail, it remains for a couple of weeks. 
 
 Mysuru Paints and Varnish Limited, a Karnataka government undertaking, provides indelible ink to all states and to 25 foreign countries too. In the 2013 Karnataka assembly election, 1.50 lakh bottles of ink were supplied.
 
 HA  , chairman of Mysuru Paints and Varnish Limited, said, "The   gave directions to come out with indelible ink in a marker pen. The Commission tested the marker pen and was satisfied. The laboratory, too, is happy with the marker pen which is user-friendly and also cost-effective. Marker pens were mooted following feedback from voters that marking by brushes is not neat. Marker pens are also easier to store and transport. Each marker pen can be used for nearly 1,000 people. The rate for each marker pen is yet to be decided by the election commission. We have stocked all raw materials for marker pens, and once we get approval from the EC, we will start manufacturing them."
 
 Marker pens were used in some elections in Afghanistan and feedback was good. Venkatesh said that Malaysia, Cambodia and Nepal have also ordered for marker pens.
