NEW DELHI:  , a petitioner in the   case, on Monday credited Prime Minister   with creating a "revolutionary law," news agency ANI has reported.

 "Modi ji made a revolutionary law in the interest of victims, I was very happy," she said, days after the   passed a bill criminalising triple talaq.
 
 Incidentally, Ishrat joined the BJP at its Howrah office on Saturday.
 
 "I will work in the party's women wing," ANI quoted her as saying about the move.
 
 Ishrat, whose husband divorced her over the phone from Dubai in 2014 by saying 'talaq' thrice, was among the five petitioners in the triple talaq case.
 
 The controversial practice was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court on August 22.
 
 On December 28, the Lower House of Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2017, which criminalises triple talaq and prescribes punishment for violators.
