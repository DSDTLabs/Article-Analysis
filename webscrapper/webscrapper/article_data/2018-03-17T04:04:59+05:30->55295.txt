Ghaziabad: A 65-year-old resident has accused a   of selling him a flat that was already registered in another person’s name.

 The complainant, Ved Prakash Singhal, said he came to know about the alleged fraud two days back when he saw a newspaper notice by the State bank of India fixing a date for auctioning the plot on which the flat is constructed.
 
 Singhal said he had bought the ground-floor flat from the builder for Rs 14.5 lakh on February 6, 2012, and since been living there with his family. Singhal said he had taken a loan from the   for the flat and had been paying the EMI.
 
 The builder,  , refuted the allegations against him. “There are two flats on the same plot. The auction notice is not for Singhal’s flat. They have lodged a complaint with vested interest.”
 
 An officer posted at   police station said: “In cheating cases, an FIR is registered only after taking permission from the senior superintendent of police. We have received the complaint and it will be forwarded to the senior officer.”
