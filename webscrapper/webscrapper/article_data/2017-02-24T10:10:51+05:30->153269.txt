LUCKNOW: A student was assaulted in the science faculty canteen on Thursday for stopping a group from passing indecent remarks on girls. He was rushed to the   with head injury. This was the 12th incident of violence on the campus in the past two months. 

 Eyewitnesses said a group of boys from the science faculty were sitting in the canteen when another group of Acharya Narendra Dev hostel residents passed lewd remarks at the girl students there. When the boy objected, the hostellers attacked him with a cold drink bottle and hurled canteen benches at other science students. Proctor board members reached the canteen and rushed the student to the trauma centre.
 
 However, no action had yet been initiated against the attackers. Proctor board officials said they could not record the statement of the student because he had left the hospital.
 
 "We were told by other students in the canteen that his name was Mozzim, an MSc Maths student. However, when we contacted Mozzim, we found he was not the one. Now we will talk to the eyewitnesses for help in finding the victim," said a board member. 
 
 Chief proctor Vinod Singh said, "The injured student has not filed any complaint. We need to first identify his attackers for action." 
 
 Other students on the campus said lack of action is emboldening trouble-makers. After a series of violent incidents in December and January, TOI on February 7 had highlighted how law and order on the campus was deteriorating, following which LU took action in some cases, including expulsion of three hostelers. In most cases, culprits get away easily because no one comes forward to identify them out of fear. Students said installation of CCTV on the campus would help in identifying culprits and checking violence.
