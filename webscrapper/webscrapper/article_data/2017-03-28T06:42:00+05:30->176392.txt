Nagpur: “Journalists act as a watchdog against the ails the society faces and therefore should raise the bar to dispel negative propaganda creeping into the system these days,” said SN Vinod, a veteran journalist, on Sunday.

 He was speaking as the chief guest at a programme organized by Vidarbha Gaurav Pratishthan at Shriramant Baburao Dhanwate Sabhagruha, Shankar Nagar, to honour Mahesh Mokalkar, district governor of Rotary Club, with Prakash Deshpande Kushal Sanghatak Puraskar. Vinod said, “The ability to tolerate has taken a back seat. Hence, it is now the responsibility of the society to create a better environment, for the good of every individual.” 
 
 Addressing the gathering, Ramtek MP Krupal Tumane said that the process of change often hits bureaucratic hurdles. Against this background, journalists will have to play an active role and ensure that people get justice, he added.
 
 Former MP Datta Meghe recalled the qualities of Prakash Deshpande as a journalist and his contribution to the society. 
 
 Earlier, the programme started with the lighting of a traditional lamp. Vanarai chief Girish Gandhi made the introductory remarks. Tumane and other guests felicitated Mokalkar with a shawl, memento and Rs 21,000.
 
 Replying to the felicitation, Mokalkar said, “Rotary Club does not allow anyone to be part of its higher hierarchy. It has to be earned. My engineering background helped me scale the ladder.” 
 
 Rotary is the only organization where professionals from various fields having a common ideology of working for the uplift of the society come together and does its best, he added. Mokalkar also announced to donate the   money to an organization working in the interests of the society.
 
 Sayyed Shirin conducted the programme while Balasaheb Kulkarni proposed a vote of thanks.
