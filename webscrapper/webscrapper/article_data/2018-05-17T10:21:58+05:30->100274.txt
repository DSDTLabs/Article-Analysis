NAGPUR: The district and sessions court on Tuesday issued notice to   vice-chancellor   in a criminal application filed by former chairman of   Sunil Mishra.

 Mishra has levelled a charge of moral turpitude against Kane, who, as controller of examinations, had allegedly failed to dissociate himself from the exam work when his daughter was appearing in her BE Exam in summer 2012. Kane held the charge from November 15, 2010 to November 13, 2012.
 
 Earlier, Mishra had written to the chancellor informing him that Kane had failed to inform the Board of Examination (BoE) as well as dissociate himself from exam work. Mishra moved the HC, but withdrew the case on May 4 to approach the magistrate.
 
 Mishra submitted to the court that it is a case of ‘moral turpitude’ as Kane is occupying the highest position under the law. According to the application, Kane’s act attracts action under Section 44(E) of the Old Act or Section 64 of the New Act.
