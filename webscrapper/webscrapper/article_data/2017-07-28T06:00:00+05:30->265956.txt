The engagement of actor-turned-entrepreneur   to city girl   at a star hotel in Hyderabad came as a pleasant surprise after Ajay revealed that it’s not an arranged match.“I met Richa one-and-half years ago and later, we started seeing each other. Today, getting engaged to my lady love feels great, especially since our parents accepted our relationship and are happy,” says Ajay, who’ll tie the knot with Richa on August 16 in both   and South Indian-style. The do, which was an intimate affair, saw actress   and Allu Arjun’s wife   among others, grace the occasion.
