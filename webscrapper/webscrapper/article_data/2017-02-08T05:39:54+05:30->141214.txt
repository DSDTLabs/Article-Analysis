AMRITSAR: A majority of candidates in the fray at   and   rushed to fortune-tellers after the EC ordered repolling on Tuesday.

 The EC has ordered repolls at 12 polling stations in Majitha and 16 at   seat. With fortune-tellers advising candidates to buy precious stones, jewellers too ended up having a busy day. A leading astrologer from Amritsar, who didn’t want to divulge his identity or that of his influential political client, said, “This was destined. Success was not so easy. I had predicted ‘obstacles’ in achieving the desired goal (for my client). I am taking my client to Bagla Mukhi Mata temple in Himachal Pradesh tonight for a yajna.”
 
 Another local astrologer, Narinder Sharma, said the practice of candidates seeking divine intervention was not new. “Turning to God for victory in the elections has been here since time immemorial. Rather, it is a traditional practice to seek blessings of the Almighty,” Sharma added.
 
 He claimed that there were certain “yajnas” (rituals) that would benefit contestants. “Now re-polling has seeded suspicion in the hearts of many candidates. That is why they are running to astrologers like me for  ,” he said.
 
 Sources informed that as the news reached him, a candidate rushed his dear ones to a temple in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir on the suggestion of his astrologer. “The purpose of the visit is to perform a nonstop ‘puja’ for 48 hours at an old temple,” sources said.
 
 A gemstone-dealer, Pardeep Kumar, said he was surprised to find sudden phone calls from astrologers asking for high-quality emerald-, garnet-, and topaz-studded rings for their clients’ success. “Re-polling has come as a boon for our business,” he said.
