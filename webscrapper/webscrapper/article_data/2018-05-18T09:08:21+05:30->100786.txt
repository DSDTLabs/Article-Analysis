MYSURU: The broken compound wall of the   athletics ground has forced athletes and strollers to leave the ground early in the evening as the ground has become a haven for anti-social elements and illegal activities.

 The food and civil supplies department had brought down a part of the compound wall during   last year to make way for parking for those who were attending the food festival. The department then had assured the varsity that the wall would be sealed soon after the   festivities were over, but the officials failed to keep their promise even after seven months, sources said.
 
 The compound wall is now posing a grave risk to the safety of athletes who practice here and evening strollers, they added.
 
 Even after sending reminders to the food and civil supplies department, no effort has been made to set right the compound wall. Earlier, the ground was secure, but now anybody can enter the premises, posing risk to the safety and security of athletes, said an official of the university.
 
 P Krishnaiah, director (incharge), department of physical education, University of Mysore, said, “While breaking the compound wall the authorities had assured that once the   is over it will set right the wall immediately, but even six months after Dasara, the authorities have failed to set it right. Even last month I wrote a letter to the authorities requesting them to set right the compound wall, but to no avail.” Nearly 500 athletes practice in this ground every day, he added.
 
 Manteswamy, deputy director, food and civil supplies department, Mysuru, who took charge just 20 days ago and was on election duty at HD  , said: “I am not aware of the issue as I recently took charge and was bbusy with election work. I will try and speak to the authorities concerned and try to set right the compound wall at the earliest.”
