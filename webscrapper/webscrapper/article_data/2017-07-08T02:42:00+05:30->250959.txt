Chandrapur: Two villagers were injured in the fresh predator attacks in Chorti village in North Bramhapuri. While the hunting teams of forest department have failed to tranquillize and capture the troublesome tigress (T-27cub-1), the latest attacks have sparked more discontent among the villagers. Forest officers have claimed that it is a work of a leopard. 

 Farmer leader Vinod Zhodge, who had led the agitation against forest department over tiger issue, informed that first attack took place in the patch of Zudpi jungle just behind Gram Sabha Bhavan in Chorti village at around 3.30pm. One Narayan Kamdli (35) was passing through the shrubby patch, when the lurking tiger charged at him. The tiger tore the right shoulder of Kamdli, but he was saved as villagers rushed to his rescue on hearing his cries. The tiger left Kamdli in pool of blood and fled away. 
 
 The mob tried to search for the tiger in the surrounding area for around half an hour. While people were returning, the tiger once again attacked Sahdev Talmale (50), who had lingered behind. Zhodge informed that the tiger had disfigured the face of Talmale. Both the victims were rushed to Bramhapuri for emergency treatment. Later, Talmale was shifted to Gadchiroli civil hospital as his condition worsened. 
 
 Large crowd had gathered on the spot following the incident. Police team from Bramhapuri had rushed to the spot. DCF Bramhapuri Kulraj Singh however maintained that a leopard was involved in the attack, countering the claim of Zhodge who claimed it was tiger.
