GHAZIABAD: The police have failed to make any breakthrough in the case in which two staffers of a Mumbai-based trader were allegedly robbed of 10 kg gold jewellery on Monday. Officials, however, confirmed they had got important leads and would soon zero in on the suspects.

 The two bullion traders of a firm headquartered in Zaveri Bazar of Mumbai had been robbed of jewellery, estimated to be worth nearly Rs 3 crore, while travelling from Meerut to Delhi in a hired cab. They had taken the jewellery to Meerut in order to show it as samples to prospective clients.
 
 Police sources said the entire consignment that was robbed from the traders had been insured by the owner and an insider hand was suspected in the incident. The consignment belonged to a firm called Union Chains & Jewellers in Mumbai. The two staffers, Rohit Jain and Kishan, were employed in the marketing department of the firm.
 
 “The men were fully aware that the jewellery was insured. It seems prima facie that the   had been stage-managed in order to claim the insurance and sell the jewellery in the market. A bigger network of persons seems to be at work that had staged-managed the crime meticulously. We have vital leads and arrests are likely soon,” said a senior police officer.
 
 On Tuesday, inspector general, Meerut range, Ram Kumar visited   and took stock of the progress in the investigation.
 
 Two of the four robbers were allegedly wearing uniforms of Delhi Police. 
 
 SP (city), Akash Tomar, had recovered a ‘cap’ that had apparently been worn by one of the two men impersonating as cops from within the car in which the traders were travelling.
