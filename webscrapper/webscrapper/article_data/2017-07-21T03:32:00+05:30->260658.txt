Calangute: The senior citizens ghar in Calangute, built around three years ago, has become embroiled in a controversy after the new Calangute panchayat members, taking over recently, discovered that there are no records pertaining to the facility’s construction with the panchayat, although the panchayat is said to have constructed it. The senior citizens ghar was constructed at the initiative of former sarpanch Joseph Sequeira on land which had been donated to the Calangute panchayat for a cattle pound. The facility was later handed over to the Senior Citizens Association of Calangute (SCAC), allegedly without any proper legal documentation. SCAC members meet there regularly and also rent out the premises for functions. During a recent gram sabha, Calangute sarpanch Anthony Menezes said the entire structure is illegal.  “Although the land belongs to the panchayat, there are no records of the ghar being constructed or the expense involved. It is being managed by the SCAC, but it is the panchayat which is paying the electricity and other maintenance bills, while the SCAC is renting out the premises for functions,” he said.
