Say the name   and one would immediately assume she is a North Indian. 

 However, Kalhaarah is as Malayali as she can be, says the model-turned-actress, who ironically, is making her debut as a North Indian character in a film! Kalhaarah will be seen as the lead actress in Shafeer Khan's upcoming movie Prethamundu Sookshikkuka, where she will be seen opposite  . 'I had always wanted to be an actress and modelling was just a means to cinema for me. After I completed my education, I modelled for a few ads and that's when the opportunity to act in Shafeer Khan's film came by. I immediately said yes, as I loved the story. The movie is going to be a fun ride,' she says.
 
  In the film she plays a girl called Alice, the daughter of a millionaire builder. 'She doesn't know Malayalam well and is a pakka North Indian girl, who dresses up in trendy clothes. Under certain circumstances, she gets close to Shine Tom's character and gradually falls in love with him,' she says.
 Shine Tom plays a quotation guy in the film, who, however, has a certain sense of ethics when he takes up his 'projects'.
  Shoot for the film is almost over, and interestingly, everyone on the set assumed that Kalhaarah is a North Indian, she says. 'The name Kalhaarah means water lily in Sanskrit. I grew up in Kerala but went to Bangalore for my higher studies. Perhaps that's why I don't look a Malayali. I'm just waiting for the audiences' feedback for the film,' she signs off.
