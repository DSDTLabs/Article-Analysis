 Rita Ora and Scottish DJ   have ended their feud, following their messy 2015 split. 

 Post their split, the 33-year-old DJ refused to let Rita, 26, perform their song " " but he has since had a change of heart. 
 
  
  
 "Late last year they got in touch and sorted things out. It was such a relief to both of them that they could move on and put things behind them. At the end of the day they had a lot of good times together and it was sad that was tainted by how bitter the split was at times," a source said. 
 
 "But things are really good now although they are not so close they're heading out to dinner anytime soon or anything. But Rita is now back in touch with a lot of Calvin's industry friends and able to work on music with them and, most importantly, able to perform 'I Will Never Let You Down'."
