Salem: A day after slashing fares by Rs 5 to woo passengers,   drivers in the city on Tuesday decided to roll back the fare cut citing financial unviability of the move.

 A section of share auto drivers in the city cut the fares after the   (TNSTC) introduced buses with stops anywhere in the city that charged a passenger Rs 5.
 
 As the new bus service ate into their revenues, share auto drivers in the New Bus Stand decided to reduce the minimum fare from Rs 10 to Rs 5. And they introduced the new fare system in the city on Monday.
 
 However, share auto drivers in the   area, refused to reduce the fare. Notwithstanding this opposition, the share auto drivers who plied between New Bus stand and   on Monday charged only Rs 5 from the passengers, instead of the usual fare of Rs 10.
 
 “Usually, we charge Rs 10 from passengers for a ride anywhere between New Bus stand and Kondappanaickenpatty,” said K Palanivel, a share auto driver. It was a pleasant surprise for regular passengers when they were asked to pay only Rs 5 instead of Rs 10 on Monday. But it meant a loss of Rs 50 per trip.
 
 On Tuesday evening, the share auto drivers in the New Bus Stand decided to roll back the fare cut, citing loss. “The new fare would fetch us only Rs 50 a trip against Rs 100 earlier. We have to spend on fuel and other maintenance works daily. We could not bear these expenses from what we earn from the newly-introduced fare,” they said.
 
 They also said the section of share auto drivers in the Old Bus Stand were also not happy with their move to slash the fare and had urged them to roll back their decision, saying passengers were asking them to reduce the fare.
 
 “To avoid conflicts among share auto drivers and owners, we have decided to reverse to the old fare of Rs 10,” share-auto drivers association said.
