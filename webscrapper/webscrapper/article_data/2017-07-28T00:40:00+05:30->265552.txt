Jaisalmer: Though the skies have stopped pouring, water level in Barmer’s Luni river is increasing steadily, causing worry to the district administration and locals.

 People living near the river have moved to safer altitudes. While several people have been rescued from the flooded areas of Gudamalani and Dhorimanna, the right camels stranded in the middle of the Luni river, are yet to get help. These camels have been stuck in the current of the river for the past three days.
 
 District collector Shiv Prasad Nakate said, it is quite challenging to rescue the camels and there is lot of risk. Water level is high in the river and it is very difficult to rescue them. Talks are on with air force, but camels are caught in swamp and airlifting them might increase the risks of hurting their legs.
 
 Warning boards have been put at many places. On Wednesday night, around 25 cows were rescued near Balotara. The water is coming out of the broken Narmada canal, but has been controlled. At present there is no situation of danger and watch is being kept continuously. There is heavy resentment among cattle raisers over this. Cattle raiser Jogaram Devasi said, ``in-charge minister Surendra Goyal was apprised about the camels caught in the river, but he did not pay attention and if these camels are not rescued on time, then they will die’’.
 
 The collector said situation at Gudamalani and Dhorimanna where water of Narmada canal, had entered is now improving and water is receding from the houses. He said 70 people were from Gandhavkhurd area near Gudamalani and directives issued to PWD and NHIA team to reconstruct the road with immediate effect which got broken in rain.
