AGRA: After high speed winds and heavy rain on Wednesday caused several   and unipoles to topple over, the   ( ) administration directed field officials to ensure rooftop or roadside hoardings or unipoles are not installed without safety assessment and issuance of a certificate to the effect.
 
 The storm on Wednesday evening left a trail of destruction. A large number of rooftop hoardings and unipoles were damaged and many crashed on roads. This resulted in massive traffic jams in the city. The situation also raised questions about whether safety norms were being followed in installation of large hoardings and unipoles.
 
  
 Now, AMC administration is working to implement a revised advertisement policy for 2018-19. Under this policy, MG Road will be made hoarding-free zone. According to civic body officials, a survey had been initiated to identify the spots on MG Road where illegal hoardings had been installed but it was stopped after Wednesday’s storm as a majority of roof-top hoardings were destroyed by high speed winds.
 
 According to norms, the MG Road stretch from Bhagwan Talkies to   is to be free of any hoardings. On all crossings on MG Road, installation of hoardings is prohibited within 100 meters of both sides of the road. However, before the storm, there were more than 500 hoardings on display. Now, a majority of these have been damaged.
 
  
 Additional municipal commissioner Vijay Kumar said, “A majority of hoardings which were on display were ripped off by the winds and fell down on the road. The situation caused traffic problems in the city and could have resulted in a major accident. Therefore, a decision has been taken to make a public safety assessment for installation of a hoarding. Advertisement companies will have to compulsorily take public safety certificate from AMC to install roof-top hoarding or unipoles.”
