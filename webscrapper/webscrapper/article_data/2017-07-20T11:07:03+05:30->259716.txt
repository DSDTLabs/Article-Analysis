 The boy’s father,   (38), jumped into the water on Tuesday evening after hearing his only son had drowned in the afternoon. But villagers saved him, the police said.
 
 The city fire brigade’s station duty officer, Prakash Gore, said the deceased was identified as Sanket Suresh Dalvi. The Haveli police have registered a case of accidental death.
 
 The police said Dalvi and his two friends had gone for swimming amid rain around 3pm on Tuesday in the rivulet, leading to the Khadakwasla dam. The village’s local body has constructed a small bund on the rivulet before its confluence with the Mutha river (Khadakwasla dam).
 
 Gore said the fire brigade received an emergency call late on Tuesday afternoon, following which a search and rescue operation was undertaken. But the fire brigade personnel could not locate Dalvi’s body till Tuesday night. The operation resumed on Wednesday morning and the body was traced and recovered from a spot just near the dam, almost 1km away from the bund.
 
 Gore said the stream had a strong current on Tuesday since it was raining continuously in the Khadakwasla region. The boy was a good swimmer but he neglected his friends’ advice not to wade into the water.
