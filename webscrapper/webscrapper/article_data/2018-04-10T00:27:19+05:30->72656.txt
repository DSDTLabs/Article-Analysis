MUMBAI: While allowing a 13-year-old   survivor to terminate her 24-week   on Monday, the   lamented the loss of precious time that would have made it safer for her to undergo the procedure.

 A   test on March 17 had revealed she was pregnant. Hearing a plea by her father to terminate the pregnancy, a bench of Justices Naresh Patil and Anuja Prabhudessai questioned the delay in approaching the court. His advocate Deepa Chavan said neither the girl nor her parents were informed of her pregnancy. Only when NGO   learnt of it, it speeded up efforts to move high court.
 
 
  
 The judges said almost a month was lost and the girl would have been have been closer to 20 weeks then, within which the law permits abortion. “You (police) could have saved time. Apart from this technicality, life would have been more safer. She would have been in a safe zone,” said Justice Patil. 
 
 The girl was abducted from   in July 2017 by a daily labourer 10 years older to her and was rescued by NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan on March 15, 2018, from an Uttar Pradesh village. 
 
 On Saturday, a special bench of high court interviewed the girl and constituted a medical board of JJ Hospital.
 
 The board, in its report, recommended termination, saying while it would be risky for her but continuing with the pregnancy would be riskier. Allowing   of the pregnancy, the judges directed the girl to be present on Tuesday before the hospital’s dean and the latter to ensure it is done by experts and supervised by superiors in the department. 
 
 They also asked the state if earlier in such cases involving minors, a circular or guidelines have been issued to police stations. They judges said they will also issue directions so that police officers act fast.
