CHENNAI: A burglar alarm system, installed in   shops to prevent theft, is turning out to be not so foolproof a security arrangement as the SIM card enabled apparatus is facing trouble in several outlets due to a range of issues including poor mobile network connectivity.

 Tasmac officials said the security apparatus attached to the cash box in the shops would raise an alarm in case of an attempt to break it open. A SIM card had been inserted in the alarm system that would automatically send alerts to Tasmac authorities and the police.
 
 “But this can be activated only when there is signal in the area. Instead of selecting SIM cards of mobile networks with good coverage, they have chosen a private mobile operator with poor coverage, rendering the foolproof mechanism useless,” a Tasmac employee said. The alarm was installed in 280 selected shops in Chennai, Kancheepuram and   districts a month ago.
 
 Liquor outlets have been brought under the security cover after burglary attempts were reported at shops across the state. Officials said thieves decamped with about ₹2.5 lakh from two shops in the northern suburbs of Manali in two different incidents in a month.
 
 “Another loophole is that mobile numbers of the supervisor and salesmen are not in the system. These men usually live near the outlets and can rush to them in an emergency,” the employee said.
 
 D Dhanasekaran, general secretary of  , said, “Such issues have led to poor implementation of the security feature to protect revenue in the shops.”
 
 A Tasmac official said managers have been told to use SIM cards of mobile operators depending on the coverage.
