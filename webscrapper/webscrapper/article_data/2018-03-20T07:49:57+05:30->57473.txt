AHMEDABAD : The   of   busted a ‘con call centre’ in Noida, UP, for duping people across the country including many from Gujarat, using the lure of exorbitant ‘insurance policy payouts’. The   would get victims to deposit money into various bank accounts as ‘service and file charges’ and would then stop receiving their calls.

 One victim, a retired ONCG employee, was duped out of Rs 65 lakh. “The gang sent him a fake letter, purportedly from the RBI stating the exorbitant maturity payout, to seal the con,” said deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, Deepan Bhadran. The cyber cell had earlier nabbed Rajesh Kumar Vatsa (50), an account holder in the State Bank of Patiala and a resident of Delhi. The former ONGC employee was made to transfer funds into Vatsa’s account.
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police Rajdeepsinh Jhala, said that on interrogating Vatsa, it emerged that Akhtarali Khan, who ran a call centre in Noida, would pay him a hefty commission to use his account.
 
 A team led by Inspector J S Gaddam raided the call centre and nabbed six persons — Badlu Saifee (24) and Saroj Rajput (22) of Ghaziabad; Aakash Gupta (20) and Imran Khan of Delhi; Jay Sharma (20) of Noida, Zaiba Sardarkhan (23) and Mohammed Zeeshan Khan — from a rented office in Noida.
 
 “It emerged that Akhtarali would hire people to call various targets and get information about their insurance policies and their dates of birth.
 
 “Other callers would then tell the victims that they would receive maturity amount payouts much higher than what the victims would expect. They would then seek various charges and make victims deposit money in various bank accounts,” added Gaddam.
 
 Once the money was deposited, they would stop taking calls from the victims. “We suspect this is just the tip of the iceberg, as notes and dairies recovered contain shocking amounts of details of victims,” Jhala said.
