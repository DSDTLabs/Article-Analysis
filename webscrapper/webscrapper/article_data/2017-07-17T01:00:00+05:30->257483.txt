Having done eight films of different genres in the past five years in the industry,   says that he always wanted to be part of a comedy. And he got the opportunity to do so with ' '. He says, “Comedy was a genre I was dying to do ever since I became an actor. Besides, we haven't seen that many comedies being made in the last five years. Having said that, I was also looking at humour that works pan-India. And that's where this film works for me as it's not aimed to appeal to only the urban audience."

 He also clarifies that the humour in the film doesn’t stem from a series of gags. “Mubarakan is a situational comedy and does not rely on gags. It’s a sort of ' ' meeting 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'. Also, if I am getting the opportunity to work with   and   in one film, then that means that I must have worked very hard in my life. Plus, I was getting the opportunity to do a double role which doesn’t rely on mistaken identity. My most important co-actor was going to be me. This was a challenge I wanted to undertake just to see how it all came together,” says the actor.
