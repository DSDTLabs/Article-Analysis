KANPUR:   duo Sanjeev Dayal (55) and Vidhya (50) who were found locked in their flat in Twin Tower in   for past 15 days and later rescued by the police on the intimation by the neighbours, regained consciousness on Wednesday. The two are undergoing treatment at the ICU of the   after they were brought here.

 The locals had alleged that they had locked themselves up and were not seen out of the flat for past two weeks. The doctor treating the couple told TOI that they are malnourished and very pale. But started responding to the treatment being given to them. However, what worried the   at the LLR hospital was that both of them were not speaking. This is also keeping police guessing what had gone wrong because of which they had locked themselves up in the house. The doctor, however, said that both of them appear to be in depression and that he would be seeking help from psychiatrist on Wednesday. Sanjeev is an ex-IITian and had done his BTech from the institute.
