 According to the newly elected Congress MLA from the constituency, Congress’s  , the PA systems at gurdwaras are making the announcements to ensure that dealers don’t cry political vendetta when they are arrested. “I don’t want any controversies; that is why I am ensuring that gurdwaras at all villages give a clear warning to everyone dealing or consuming drugs to shun it within 24 hours or face strict police action,” he said. “The warning is for my supporters also.”
 
 Sikki said directions to the police were clear: catch the consumers and take leads from them for nabbing the sellers. “We can eradicate this menace only if we catch the dealers,” he said. “Police have done their homework and have identified persons involved in the drug trade. Still, for the sake of humanity, we have given them a last chance.”
 
 Having been elected as the MLA eight days ago, Sikki has put himself on the ground to eradicate a menace that starts from prescription pills costing Rs 10 and goes up to heroin costing Rs 3,000 a gram. The effort is in line with the promise of Sikki’s party chief and chief minister   to eradicate the drug menace in four weeks of coming to power. 
 
 Sikki seemed confident of bringing about a change in his constituency. “We could be a model for the rest of the state to follow. My supporters and I are ready to catch hold of drug peddlers. We have told people that if they are suspicious of their children taking drugs, they should contact us. We will help the child and also nab the dealers with their help,” he said.
