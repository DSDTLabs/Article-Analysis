MANDYA: While the state government has been celebrating Mysuru Dasara with pomp and gaiety, the historical  , where Dasara was first reintroduced in 1610 by the Wodeyars, has partially collapsed due to  .The portion of the fort near the main gate on the eastern side collapsed with big boulders and heaps of mud strewn all over the place. The collapse indicates how the archaeological department, custodian of this fort, has been lackadaisical in preserving this monument. Nearly 40 metres of the fort has collapsed and more is likely to cave in.

 A senior archeological officer said necessary measures will be taken to restore the collapsed fort and stop further erosion.However, he refused to elaborate how the fort col lapsed now.
 
 Basavaraju, a vendor, said   fort was recently rejuvenated and the collapse of a portion of the fort due to rain proves the shoddiness of the work.
