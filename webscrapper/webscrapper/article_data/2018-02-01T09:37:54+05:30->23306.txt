LUCKNOW: UP’s industrial policy with which the UP government hopes to attract investment of over Rs 1 lakh crore was launched amid much fanfare last year. It is another thing that officials of the   have not yet found time to read it.

 During a review meeting for the Investors’ Summit, which is just three weeks away, only five out of 150 general managers of the district industrial centres claimed to have read the policy.
 
 Industries minister   was livid to see just five hands go up in response to his question about how many had read the policy. “These are the senior most officials in the   department who have been posted here for 15-20 years. I thought I would start the meeting by asking how many had read the policy and further question those who had about the details. However, I was left shocked
 
 when only five persons put up their hands. I have given strict directions to them to read the policy before they come for the next meeting,” Mahana told TOI.
 
 In fact, officials have been told that action will be initiated against them if clearances for setting up industries are not issued within the stipulated time frame, as stated in the policy.
 
 Booklets with   and related policies were also distributed at the meeting and officials told to carry their copy of the rules with them at all times.
 
 Officials said that other than being totally unprofessional, the fact that district level officials had no idea about the policy was also worrying since they would be interacting with potential investors. “The Investors’ Summit which is on February 21 and 22 is a huge deal for the government. If these officials don’t know the policy, how can they interact with the   we are expecting to come here? In any case, industrial development in the state cannot be dependent on two days of a summit. The lack of much development in the state so far can easily be explained through this casual attitude of officials,” said a senior officer.
