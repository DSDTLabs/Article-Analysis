COIMBATORE: A total of 36,833 students from Coimbatore   district will appear for Class XII   exams, which would commence on Thursday with language paper-I, said officials attached to the education department. 
 
 Of these, 30,028 students are from Coimbatore educational district and 6,805from Pollachi educational district. As many as 2,070 private students from the two educational districts would also sit for the exams, an official said. 
  
 There are 113   centres spread across Coimbatore and Pollachi. “Around 3,200 teachers have been deputed for exam duty. Also, 250 flying squad members will be pressed into service,” said an education department official, who didn’t want to be named. 
  
 This year, the education department has added four new centres to help students from rural areas. “We have added centres even in those areas where the number of students sitting for exam isn’t encouraging as we didn’t want them to travel long distances to appear for exam,” the official said. 
  
 The exams would conclude on April 6.
