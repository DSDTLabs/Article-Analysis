Nagpur: Veteran journalist-turned-activist   is now set to write to state chief minister   complaining against lackadaisical approach of the Sakkardara police in the matter of international trafficking in which a city-based woman was sold in   for Rs2 lakh. Victim Hamida (name changed) was compelled to work as ‘human slave’ before she escaped from the clutches of her tormentors last year.

 Akila  , city based agent who is now being made accused for having brokered the deal to sell Hamida, had been so far given a long rope by the Sakkardara police for the reasons best known to them. Despite being booked and present at Sakkardara police station last week, Akila was allowed to return to family to attend a family marriage. Akila, banking on the alleged largesses of the cops, had approached court for pre-arrest bail. On Tuesday, it was learnt that Sakkardara police was summoned at the court for their say in the pre-arrest bail plea. Investigation officer sub-inspector Chitre Meshre is learnt to have opposed the bail. On Wednesday, the matter would be heard again to decide whether relief can be granted to Akila in the case.
 
 In the meantime, activist Choubey has claimed that he now intends to write to CM Devendra Fadnavis and other senior officials complaining against the baffling delays in the case and other irregularities. “It was shocking for us to know that a gangster had come to police station to meet the woman agent which means that there could be a bigger nexus playing pivotal role behind these rackets thriving here,” he said.
