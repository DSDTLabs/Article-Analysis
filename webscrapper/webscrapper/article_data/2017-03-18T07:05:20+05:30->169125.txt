HYDERABAD: The   that has rocked   Air Costa has not only  , but also seems to have left it in   anytime soon. 

 The airline, which has been desperately trying to get an investor on board, is now staring at an even bigger storm as all its pilots and co-pilots have made a quick exit, only to land in other airlines. Another 100-odd   employees have taken the exit route and many more are on their way out.
 
 "Air Costa had 14 pilots and 30 first officers (co-pilots), all of whom have resigned. Nobody has served their full notice period...the moment the airline grounded its aircraft on February 28, people started leaving. By March 7-8... almost all (pilots) left and today Air Costa does not have a single pilot on its payroll," said an Air Costa source requesting anonymity. 
 
 When contacted, Air Costa vice-president (marketing and brand communication) Kavi Chaurasia admitted that all the airline's pilots have quit. "All the captains have left because there is no flying happening... but once they see that there is a possibility of resuming operations, I am hopeful that key pilots... at least 50% of them will come back," he said.
