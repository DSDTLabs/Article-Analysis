Dagdu Bhamre, a 103-year-old retired accountant from  , made a glorious marathon debut in the 4.3 km senior citizen category on Sunday. 

 Inspired by his run, all family members who came to cheer him want to run in next year's event. 
 
 Three generations of family members wearing badges with Bhamre's pictures were present. While Bhamre completed the feat in his dhoti and shirt, his sandals made way for new canvas shoes. 
 
 Bhamre said he loved being on the move. When asked if he would return next year, he laughed and said: “Agar main rahoonga to zaroor aaoonga. Aage ka kya pata (If I am there, I will come. Who knows about future?).”
