Interacting with parents, Kunte discussed several factors on the importance of reading and said that this habit should be developed from childhood as it is the time when you can cultivate them in your child’s brain. Books sharpen your mind and improve the thought process. To encourage students to read books, efforts are needed at home and in educational institution as well, she added.
