BENGALURU: The 
  in the   had earned notoriety as the 
  , riding roughshod over locals who questioned their high-handedness. And that's what helped police close in on them.

 Soon after receiving CCTV footage from the owner of a house in front of which the molestation happened, police collected footage from four or five other spots near the scene of crime. One of the videos clearly showed the gang sitting by Rajkumar Park, near Kullappa Circle, in the area. The footage made one thing clear to the police: the culprits were locals. Armed with these photographs, the cops got sketches of the accused prepared, and hit the streets. Women officials fanned out in the neighbourhood and met many working professionals, homemakers and school and college girls, asking them whether they knew the men.
 
 The first success came on Wednesday morning when a college girl identified one sketch as that of Somashekar alias Chinni; she remembered Chinni because he passed lewd comments whenever girls walked past him. With one suspect identified, police began searching for his number and learnt that he was a delivery boy for various online portals. "On the pretext of seeking details of a parcel, we managed to get his mobile number and the mobile number tower location proved that Chinni was present at the spot when the molestation took place," police officers said. It didn't take long for police to detain Chinni and question him. "Like all accused, Chinni pleaded innocence in the beginning. When we told him that we had enough evidence to prove his involvement, he broke down. Soon, he was singing," a police source said. Chinni and his accomplices were all picked up from in and around Kammanahalli. 
 
 Police said they did make an attempt to hide but didn't leave the neighborhood. DCPs PS Harsha and Ajay Hilori led the probe.
