SURAT: A   (PSI) and a   were suspended by   Nirlipt Rai on Tuesday for not taking actions against bootleggers operating in Ondach village. The cops were provided a list of bootleggers doing business in the village on September 19, but no action was taken. 

 PSI P B Patelia and head constable Ashwin Magan were suspended after a preliminary inquiry found them guilty of negligence. The inquiry was ordered by Rai two days ago when the villagers from Ondach made a representation to him. They had alleged that despite giving names of the individual bootleggers, police did not take any action them. Sarpanch of the village Jyotsana Kodga went to Mahuva police station on September 19 with villagers and made a representation. She submitted a memorandum to the cops there with names of seven bootleggers. Since no action was taken till September 24, they approached Rai. 
 
 “The villagers told me that they made representation at the police station thrice. It was a good initiative by the sarpanch, but no action was taken by the PSI and the head constable. Hence, I have suspended them,” Rai said.
