CHANDIGARH: The back lanes of the Sector-35 market are still  ,  , and   were replaced two months ago.

 The sewage bursting out of the underground lines has fouled the market’s air and created serious breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. Replacing the pipes has not solved the problem completely, even though it has reduced the problem indeed at one end of the street. The fact that water is still accumulated in the front portion, towards the main entrance of the alley, is no less a cause for worry.
 
 After the digging and installation of sewer pipes, the marketplace was swamped with mountains of construction debris and the dug-out mud discarded on the sidewalks of the already narrow road. This shrunk the parking space for cars even further and made driving on that road a lot more difficult. “The problem exists in many ways, even though it's not as bad as before,” said Suresh Gupta, who works in a nearby restaurant. “Some of the manholes still overflow with sewage as you can see, and this wastewater has been stagnant for a long time. This is again due to the blockage of the sewer lines, because of solid-waste residue and other factors.”
 
 The water is leaking from the mouth of a water   attached to the rear door of a restaurant. This, the shopkeepers believe, is the contributing source of foul water running off on to the road. Apart from the stagnant water another cause of concern for the people around is the dominance of a foul odour. The stinking environment has turned away customers from these shops and has become a reminder of the uglier situation that existed earlier. The surroundings of the back lanes have become polluted with piles of rotten, solid waste that lines the periphery and contributes to the grim spectacle.
