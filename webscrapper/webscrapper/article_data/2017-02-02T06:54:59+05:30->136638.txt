PUNE: Ahmednagar and Kolhapur could be among the first districts in the state to roll out   from their head  , as announced in the budget on Wednesday. The regional passport office here has already sent the recommendation to the  

 The pilot project to utilise the   post offices to render passport services began a week ago in Dahod (Gujarat) and Mysuru (Karnataka). Ahmednagar and Kolhapur, under the jurisdiction of the Pune RPO, could be among the early beneficiaries of the phase-wise extension of the project as part of a systemic move to reduce inconvenience for applicants of these districts, who currently travel all the way to Pune for the sake of passports.
 
 Currently, the RPO receives about 75 to 100 passport applications from each of the districts. The number is expected to increase if there is a local passport kendra. Regional passport officer Atul Gotsurve said, “This is a step in the right direction. We have already suggested these two districts from our jurisdiction as applicants from here face a lot of hardships and prolonged travel just to reach Pune.”
 
 Sharing details of how the Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK) system will work, director of the project in the ministry Anil Kumar Sobti said, “For the ongoing pilot, we are releasing about 100 appointments everyday and the same are being utilised well.”
