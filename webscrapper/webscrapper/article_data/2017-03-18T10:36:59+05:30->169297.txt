A special team of doctors from Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute for Physically Handicapped will perform corrective surgeries of patients suffering from polio and other physical disabilities in the two-day programme. District handicap welfare officer, Dr  , said, "We have been approached by nearly 400 patients with polio who want to attend the camp on March 28 and 29. On day one of the camp, check-up of the patients will be done and the ones found fit for the surgery will be operated on second day. The surgery will be performed after receiving reports of all post-operative tests."
