 The novel follows the execution of two local drug-store pharmacists – a father and his son, while Bosch and the San Fernando PD detective squad dig into something graver and more dangerous. The clues lead them to a sinister world of pill mills, crooked doctors, greedy pharmacists, and the big business surrounding prescription drug abuse. The second case is 30 years old and goes back to the Bosch’s LAPD days, when he had helped put the convicted killer Preston Borders on death row. The case reopens and this time, Bosch is accused of planting evidence. Bosch blames this on his leaving the LAPD on a bad note. Now he has to save himself, while keeping a check on the extremely smart, ex-convict Preston Borders.

  The novel starts slow, but picks up pace as it progresses. The story has a solid plot, with fascinating twists and some shocking moments. Even after 21 books, Harry Bosch never falters in his sleuthing skills. “Two Kinds of Truth” could be considered as one of Connelly’s finest.
