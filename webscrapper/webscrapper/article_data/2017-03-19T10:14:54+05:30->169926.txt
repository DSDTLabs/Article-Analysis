NAGPUR: The city’s first radiation therapy unit for cancer treatment in private sector will be inaugurated at Alexis Hospital on Sunday by chief minister   at 11am.

 Guardian minister   and Nagpur (West) MLA   will be present during the inauguration.
 
 Taher Shams, managing director of the hospital, told reporters on Saturday that the Alexis cancer department is equipped with the state-of-the-art facilities. The linear accelerator here (TrueBeam) allows to treat even the most challenging cases of cancer with unprecedented speed and precision. It just doesn’t allow faster delivery of radiation but also gives more targeted treatment to tumours without affecting the adjoining tissue.
 
 Shams said that India is likely to have 17.3 lakh new cases of cancer and over 8.8 lakh deaths due to it by 2020. Every year, over 4 lakh new cases of cancer are recorded in   alone each year. The incidence of oral cancer is the highest among all types of cancer, followed by breast and lung cancers.
