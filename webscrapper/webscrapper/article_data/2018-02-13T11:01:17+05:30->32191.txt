KOCHI: “It’s double joy to serve as the chief justice of one’s own parent high court,” said Chief Justice  , the first Malayali chief justice of the   high court in 17 years.

 Addressing a full court reference held in his honour at the high court on Monday, he said, “After having completed more than 11 years (as a high court judge), all I looked forward to was a quiet retirement. It almost arrived. Then all of a sudden, like a stroke of lightning, it came –– to be the chief justice of this august and revered institution. It is indeed gratifying to have an opportunity to conclude my career on a happy note… Without being modest, I may say that ascending the office of the chief justice is perhaps the fitting finale a judge can aspire for in his career. With the blessings of God Almighty, I have that fortune…”
 
 “I was called to the bench and I accepted it without much fanfare. I may confess that I hoped for a career that is smooth and safe. I wanted to work answering my conscience and avoiding controversies. May be in other walks of life, people want eventful careers but judges want eventless careers...,” the chief justice said.
 
 Justice P N Ravindran, who is the senior-most judge at the high court after the CJ, said, “There is ecstasy all around... Filling up the void of more than one-and-a-half decades makes it worth rejoicing. A son of the soil adorning the coveted seat. A discerning judge, Chief Justice Antony Dominic rightly deserves this distinction...”
 
 Speaking at the function, advocate general C P   said, “It is praiseworthy in that outstanding merit has been befittingly recognized…”
