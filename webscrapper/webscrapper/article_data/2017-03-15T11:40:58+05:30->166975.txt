NEW DELHI: The   leadership has nominated party floor leader in LoK Sabha   for the post of Chairman of   ( ) of Parliament. He will succeed his party colleague K V   who is completing three terms in the post.
 
    (CPP) leadership on Tuesday wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker, conveying Khargeâ€™s name for the PAC chairmanship, a post that traditionally goes to the main Opposition party. ET had reported last Saturday that Kharge name was under consideration of PAC chairmanship.
  
  While Kharge is currently Congress floor leader of Lok Sabha without recognistion as Leader of Opposition, the PAC post will make him entitled for a Cabinet rank and an office at Paliament House besides the honour of heading the prestigious post. Indications are that he will continue as floor leader for the time being.
  
  A senior leader from Karnataka belonging to the Dalit community, Kharge is a former Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka and was union minister for railways and labour during the   regime.
  
  Thomas completed three successive terms (of one year each) as PAC head in the current Lok Sabha. His name is also doing the rounds as among the probables for the post of   PCC president.
