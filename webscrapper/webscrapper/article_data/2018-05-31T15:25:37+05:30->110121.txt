PORVORIM: An official function organised by the   to mark the completion of 31 years of Goa statehood had several speakers expressing concern over the loss of language and land, two crucial aspects of Goa’s identity.

 
  minister for law (independent charge) Ramakant Khalap, while putting on record the tremendous benefits gained through statehood, said that Goa had yet to fully exploit the ability to frame laws and bring in land reforms which could help protect Goa’s interests. “Let us protect our land, and to protect our land, let us bring in certain laws,” Khalap said. “Statehood gives us the power to frame laws for Goa and I think easily we can get unanimity among ruling and opposition on this issue.”
 
 Khalap’s views were supported by former MLAs and senior journalists Sandesh Prabhudessai and Suhas Belekar at the panel discussion on the topic ‘Goa’s Statehood – A Retrospective and Prospective’ which was held in the   conferance hall.
 
 Speaking a bit earlier, former chief minister Pratapsingh Rane mentioned that despite attaining statehood much later and missing out on the first few five-year plans, Goa today enjoyed the highest per capita income in the country.
 
 “We were practically second-class citizens. As a Union territory, we did not vote for the president. As a state, we have the right to vote for the president. This is one of the main differences,” Rane said, and then gave credit to former Prime Minister and   leader   for ensuring that Goa attained statehood.
 
 Among the few areas where Goa still had scope to improve were garbage, stray cattle and industrial growth, said Rane. The senior leader and Poriem MLA said that Goa needs a new Police Act, and questioned why certain leaders were not supporting the draft Goa Police bill.
 
 “There is so much garbage that it is annoying. This is the number one problem that Goa faces,” he said.
