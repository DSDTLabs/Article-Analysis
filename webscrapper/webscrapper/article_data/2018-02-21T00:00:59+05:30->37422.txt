 Music lovers in namma Mysuru were in for a treat over the weekend, when singer and Kannada music director Raghu Dixit put on a show for them. There was a huge turnout at the open auditorium venue of the concert as Raghu sang. But as it turns out, there was more to the show than it just being a regular gig.    The concert was part of the climax shoot of the Kannada film, Orchestra, which has Raghu onboard as music director. And as is with most film shoots, this one too required retakes of certain sequences. The crowd, of course, was only too happy to comply, when Raghu asked them to exhibit the same kind of enthusiasm and energy as they did before for the retakes. In the end, everyone was happy, as the crowd got to hear him perform, and the team canned the perfect climax.    -Sridhar V G
