CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party's suspended Patiala MP Dr   on Thursday announced the launch of a new forum named ' ,' which is expected to evolve into a formal political party in due course of time and contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. 

 Underlining the need for more powers to the states, Dr Gandhi said the Congress, BJP and   (SAD) had failed to safeguard the interests of Punjab. He alleged that AAP too had sidelined leaders from the state and was in grip of a high-command culture.
 
 He said the theme and objective is 'Federal India, Democratic Punjab,' and its vision is for a country strongly rooted in democracy, arising out of a comity of individual states exercising federal powers.
 
 Replying to a question, the suspended AAP MP from Patiala said he will quit AAP only after the Manch takes shape of a political outfit.
 
 Apart from Dr Gandhi, the other founding members include Dr Jagjeet Cheema, Prof Bawa Singh, Prof Malkiat S Saini, Prof Raunki Ram, Sukhdev Singh, Harmeet Brar, Smt Gurpreet Gill, Dilpreet Gill, and Dr  . 
 
 At present, the sum of its individual constituent parts are largely subservient to the yoke of an overly-strong, stifling, and unsuitably-centralised government. Punjab Manch aims to build a country where there's diversities of all hues," said Dr Gandhi.
