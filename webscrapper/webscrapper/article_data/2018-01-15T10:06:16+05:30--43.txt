NEW DELHI: He had Rs 2 crore in his bag and a plan to flee to another country, but 25-year-old Rahul Kumar made the fatal mistake of taking a detour to his girlfriend’s house in Faridabad. He was sure that she would agree to elope with him, but to his surprise found cops waiting for him in her drawing room. The cash was a part of the Rs 4 crore ransom that he had collected after kidnapping a south Delhi businessman’s son.

 Kumar had committed another mistake. Being a former employee of the businessman, he had made calls to another employee to ask if all was well at the office. This stunt, however, blew his cover even though he had used the victim’s phone to make the ransom calls.
 
 Police said that Kumar had been making around 35 calls a day before the kidnapping, but after the incident the number reduced to two — his girlfriend and the office employee. A watch was kept on the girlfriend’s house, which landed Kumar in the police net.
 
 The victim — who had recently returned to India after pursuing his masters from US — gave vital clues to police upon his release. He gave minute details like being confined to a newly-constructed building near NH-24 and about hearing sounds of only bikes passing by, indicating that the place where he had been kept was in a narrow lane.
 
 The clues led cops to zero in upon the kidnappers’ hideout near Vinod Nagar. The two other accused, Sunil and Ghanshyam, were arrested hours after Rahul was nabbed in Faridabad. Police recovered Rs 3.96 crore from them. The trio has been sent to Tihar Jail. Their fourth associate, Omprakash, is absconding with his share of Rs 4 lakh.
 
 On January 1, Kumar and his associates had intercepted the victim’s i20 near Vasant Vihar and demanded Rs 5 crore for his release. Kumar was disgruntled with the businessman after being sacked a few months ago. The victim was rescued on the night of January 5 and accused arrested by January 6.
