Surat: A 35-year-old Navsari-based doctor, who was booked for abetting suicide of his wife, also a doctor, is on the run since two months and changing location often, the police investigating the case said.

 Dr Mayank Patel, a resident of Ishwar Darshan Society in Kabilpore, was booked for abetting suicide of his wife Dr Dipal Patel (32), who had hanged herself to the ceiling fan at her residence on November 5 last year. Dr Mayank’s father Natwarlal is also co-accused in the case. The father-son duo was booked under the Indian Penal Code Sections 306 (abetment of suicide), 498 (cruelty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and under Dowry Prohibition Act. They were booked after Dr Dipal’s father Dhiru Gaikwad, a resident of Nani Naroli in Surat, lodged the complaint on December 1 last year against them.
 
 In his complaint, Gaikwad alleged that demand for dowry started soon after Dipal, a Masters in Anaesthesia, married Mayank, who is an ENT specialist. Dipal completed her studies at B J Medical College in Ahmedabad, while Mayank did his studies from M S University in Vadodara.
 
 Gaikwad has claimed that before his daughter ended life, he had given a car, a bungalow as dowry and even sponsored their honeymoon trip. He further alleged that despite paying so much, Dr Mayank and his family continued to torture Dipal.
 
 He also approached superintendent of police, Navsari, Girish Pandya and inspector general of police, Surat range, G S Malik after there was no progress in the case. 
 
 Dipal’s younger brother Mihir alleged, “Dr Mayank tried to kill my sister many times, but she kept mum thinking about their daughter.”
