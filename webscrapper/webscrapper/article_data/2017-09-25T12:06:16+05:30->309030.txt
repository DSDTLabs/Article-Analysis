Veteran actor Ian   said he does not want the makers to rope in anyone else to play Emperor Palpatine in the ' ' franchise. The 73-year-old actor is known for playing the villainous role in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi', as well as an earlier version of the character in the three prequel movies.

 Even though Emperor Palpatine is dead in the timeline of the new trilogy, Ian noted that the character is referenced in the spin-off movie 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story', and he hopes the film bosses are keeping him as a 'surprise', rather than hiring another actor to take over the role. 
 
 "I suppose there must be a chance but I think you'd find out about it more quickly than I would. As far as the new films are concerned, I'm dead. There is no question about that." 
 
 "But there is what they call the anthology series and actually the most recent one, 'Rogue One', was about the time when I was in charge. I was referred to a few times,   popped up, but you did not see me. Maybe they are keeping me as a surprise for later but I have no idea. Of course, I don't want anyone else to play him," McDiarmid said.
