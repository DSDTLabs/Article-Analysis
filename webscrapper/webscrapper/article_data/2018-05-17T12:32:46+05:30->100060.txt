LUDHIANA: A delegation of Federation of Industrial and   (Fico) on Wednesday met Union minister of commerce and industry  , and discussed issues facing the bicycle and other industries of Ludhiana.

 Led by president  , the delegation demanded that a steel regulatory authority be formed at the earliest, so that the problem of unnecessary hike in prices of raw material by steel cartels is resolved. Giving more information,   said: “The rise in prices of steel raw material has become a very big issue, taking a toll on the industry, especially micro and small industry. For the past one year, rates of steel raw material have shot up several times, leading to huge losses for manufacturers of bicycle parts, sewing machine parts, and other allied industries. Today, we took up this matter with the industry and commerce minister, who had taken a serious note of the issue and assured action.”
 
 Kular also said: “Since Prabhu holds the additional portfolio of aviation ministry, we had also raised the issue of the inadequate Ludhiana airport. Unfortunately, our airport is in a miserable condition, as in spite of the huge demand for outbound and inbound flights from Ludhiana to other cities on a daily basis, due to the short runway and lack of equipment, only smaller capacity planes can land here, and that is the reason only one flight is operational here, which has very less passenger and load carrying capacity. Therefore, we demanded that the airport be upgraded, and at least three flights from Ludhiana be started for Delhi.”
 
 The businessmen also discussed the issues of dumping of cheap Chinese bicycles by some companies in India under the Public Bike Sharing System, and re-introduction of Credit Link Capital Subsidy Scheme. Others present in the meeting included Fico secretary Rajeev Jain, and   secretary-general Dr KB Thakur.
