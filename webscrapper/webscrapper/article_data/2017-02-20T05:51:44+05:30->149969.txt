SURAT: MLAs elected from the city want the state government to come out with a   of old houses and  . 

 There are a large number of residential buildings on government land in the city. The housing societies which are more than 10 year old must be regularized, the MLAs said in the district coordination committee meeting held here on Saturday under the chairmanship of district collector Mahendra Patel. 
 
 Surat West MLA Purnesh Modi said a survey should be conducted on development plan (DP) and town planning (TP) scheme reservation land to assess the numbers of illegal constructions, while seeking a policy towards regularization of these structures by the state government. Regularization of old housing societies would benefit at least 70,000 families in the city, he said. 
 
 “Majority of the residences were built when DP and TP plans for the area were not made. Thus, these housing societies should be regularized as it would not be easy for   to demolish multi-storied buildings in Limbayat, Katargam, Varaccha and Udhna,” another MLA said.
