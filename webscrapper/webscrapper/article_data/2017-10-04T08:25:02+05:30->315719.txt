GANDHINAGAR: After leaving the  , former   chief minister Shankersinh   had formed a forum called ‘Jan Vikalpa’ which, he had claimed, would be the ‘third front’ in Gujarat offering voters an alternative to the   and the Congress. But Jan Vikalpa has failed to attract Vaghela’s own son, Mahendrasinh. 

 Earlier, Mahendrasinh had publically expressed a desire to join the BJP and had even gone to the Byad BJP office after resigning as Congress MLA. 
 
 He now faces an uncertain future as he has not joined Vaghela’s ‘Jan Vikalpa’ nor has he managed an entry into the BJP. 
 
 Mahendrasinh Vaghela had met   a month ago in  . Now, however, if sources are to be believed, the BJP is not responding to his feelers. Instead of joining Jan Vikalpa, Mahendrasinh is keen to join the BJP but sources said that there is dispute between Shankersinh and BJP over the seat to be allotted to Vaghela junior. 
 
 The BJP wants to accept Mahendrasinh only if he contests from Bayad seat which he currently holds. Bayad, however, is a Congress-dominated seat while Mahendrasinh has demanded Gandhinagar North, which is a relatively safe for the BJP. 
 
 A resolution to this problem is expected before  .
 
 Earlier, Mahendrasinh was expected to join the BJP before Kamurta or during  . Now that period has also passed, leaving his supporters feeling uncertain. Mahendrasinh himself wanted to join the BJP before Diwali.
 
 When contacted, Mahendrasinh Vaghela said he had no contact with the BJP for the last few days. “I may join BJP before Diwali but I am not in Jan Vikalpa,” Mahendrasinh said.
 
 However, when Shankersinh Vaghela was asked about which outfit Mahendrasinh could join, Shankersinh said: “He will not join the BJP. He is not with me either. There is no role of him (Mahendrasinh) in Jan Vikalpa. Similarly, there is no question of his joining the BJP,” Shankersinh said.
