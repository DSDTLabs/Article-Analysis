JAIPUR: A class IX student who had run away from his house located in   due to result pressure, was found from an eatery on a highway in Ahmedabad on Thursday. Jhotwara SHO Guru   said that the 15-year-old boy had run away from his house on May 3. “He was not satisfied with the marks that he had scored; hence, he tampered with his marksheet. But he got scared that he would be caught and decided to run away from the house,” he said.

 The police and the family had been tracking the boy for past several days. On Wednesday the Jaipur police was informed by the GRP Ahmedabad about the missing boy.
 
 “Before leaving his house, the boy had also written a letter in which he told his father that he is leaving the house and no efforts should be made to track him down as he is moving out on his own accord,” said an official. The Jaipur police said that the boy is being brought to the city and the police have informed his parents about the incident. “The boy is safe with GRP  , he will be brought to the city. His parents were also informed about the incident and they are now relieved,” said the official.
 
 The parents of the missing boy had told Jhotwara police that they had looked at their son’s marksheet in which he had tampered his marks from 73 to 93 per cent.
 
 “The parents had found that their son had tampered with his marksheet. But the boy had already fled from his house to avoid any embarrassment,” the officials said, adding that the family had gone to every house known to the boy but could not find him. “On May 4 they had filed a missing person’s complaint following which we set up a team to track him,” said another official.
