 “The reports give me hope. Now that negligence has been proved, I hope appropriate action will be initiated. I have nothing to look forward to in my life any more. I pray and hope that no one else suffers my fate,” she said. 
 
 “I had prayed for justice. Things are moving in that direction. The hospital that knows nothing but money should face the strongest possible action,” she added.
