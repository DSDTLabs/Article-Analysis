Coimbatore: New Year revelry turned out to be a tragedy for a group of eight youngsters, when the sports utility vehicle they were travelling in rammed into a parked truck, killing three of them and seriously injuring another three at Uthupalayam Junction on Avinashi-Coimbatore Road on Monday at 12.05am. The deceased were identified as R Rahul, 20, of Karaikurichipudur in Namakkal, M Prasanth, 26, of Kumittipathi in Othakkalmandapam and J Mohammed Shalik, 19, of Gandhi Nagar in Tirupur.
