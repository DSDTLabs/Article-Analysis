MUMBAI: In a desperate attempt to make up for the losses projected in their proposed revenue distribution for member boards this financial cycle, the   is once again mooting changes in the format of the 2021   scheduled to be hosted by India. The game’s global governing body - pressed by a section of its member boards - intends to propose the switching of the 50-over Champions Trophy format to Twenty20 from the next edition in order to make it more marketable.

 
 
 
 This, in turn, has made way for another potential clash between the ICC and the  , adding a new twist to the recent acrimony that had surfaced post the global body’s proposal to shift the tournament out of India in the absence of any tax exemptions.
 
 
 
 In the ICC board meeting this February, “concerns were expressed around the absence of tax exemption from the Indian government” for ICC events (scheduled to be) held in India. Following those ‘concerns’, the ICC had directed its management to “explore alternative host countries in a similar time zone” for the 2021 Champions Trophy, leading to a harsh reaction on part of members of the Indian board.
 
 “The format cannot and will not change. The Champions Trophy was introduced as part of the vision of our former president Jagmohan Dalmiya and it’ll be his fifth anniversary when the tournament is hosted by India. This (proposed) move has been brought to the notice of the (BCCI) members and should the ICC persist, there’ll be a strong opposition from India,” sources in the know of things added.
 
 In fact, keeping Dalmiya’s significance as a global leader of the game in mind, the BCCI has already decided to host the final of the Champions Trophy in Kolkata, sources added.
