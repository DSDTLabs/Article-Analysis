MOHALI: The municipal corporation (MC) of Mohali does not have annual records of   reports submitted by high-rise buildings, which include the busy head offices of   Development Authority (GMADA),   Board (PSEB) and Punjab  .

 MC had issued no-objection certificates (NOC) to GMADA 16 years ago, but has since not received any annual inspection report from the authority .When TOI asked GMADA to furnish records of in-house fire inspection conducted by the authority , it failed to produce any .
 
 Sources in GMADA said the authority did not maintain any records of in-house inspection. GMADA chief administrator Ravi Bhagat said he had learnt that they were not maintaining any records of time-to-time fire inspections by GMADA. “I have already directed the engineering department to get a monthly fire inspection report from every department and keep it safe. We have also intimated the state government about the inspection reports," he said.
 
 Bhagat said GMADA would ensure that the next fire inspection is conducted in presence of fire department staff, so that a “proper"inspection report can be prepared. Most fire sprinklers fitted in corridors or other part of the building have corroded and are vulnerable to malfunction during a fire emergency. Such rusted sprinklers could be seen in the corridor leading to the office of the chief admin istrator. PSEB and forest department claimed that they had installed in-house fire alarms and firefighting systems, but failed to produce any records on inspections.
 
 When contacted, MC joint commissioner Avneet Kaur said, “I am not aware of the MC seeking annual fire-inspection report from GMADA, PSEB or the forest department. None of these authorities has come up with such a report to us. I will check the norms.“
