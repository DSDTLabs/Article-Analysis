JAIPUR:   leader  , who was in Jaipur on Sunday, said that Islam does not allow its religious sites to be built on similar sites of other faiths or any disputed property.

 "According to Islam, mosque cannot be built at any disputed site. Islam also does not allow a religious structure to be named after an individual while Babur named the controversial structure after himself,’’ said Kumar, while addressing a talk on `Truth of Ayodhya, birth place of Ram’ in the city.
 
 ``If mosque has to be built it can be built outside Ayodhya and Faizabad," he said.
 
 ``The two and a half decade old dispute in Ayodhya is not over `Ram Mandir’ but over the birth place of Lord Rama,’’ he added. The senior RSS leader emphasised that there is only one birth place of the lord. "There are several Ram Temples, but Ayodhya is the only birthplace of Lord Ram and there is no dispute on Ram temple. Like Vatican city is to Christians and   is to Muslims, so is   to us (Hindus)," said Kumar.
 
 Kumar claimed that no evidences of Islam were found during archaeology surveys conducted by the government and court at the disputed site. "However, evidences related to birth place of Lord Ram were evident in the surveys," said Kumar.
 
 Newly elected   MP Madan Lal Saini said that RSS was working to bring Muslims into mainstream.
