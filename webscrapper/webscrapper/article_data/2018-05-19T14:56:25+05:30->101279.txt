COIMBATORE: Authorities have sent a proposal to the state government to set up a unit to manufacture   at the special prison for women located inside the Coimbatore central prison. Superintendent of prisons M   said 27 women convicts are lodged at the special prison for women. “We plan to set up the unit at the special prison for women soon,” he added.

  “The women convicts were given training on making handicrafts, handbags, jute bags and toys by NGOs and experts. The women prisoners were also producing ear rings made up of papers and all the products are marketed by various NGOs,” said Senthilkumar.
 
 According to sources, the prison authorities have sent the proposal to the state government two weeks ago. The authorities have also sought Rs 5 lakh to install the unit.
 
 “The women prisoners will be given training by experts,” Senthilkumar said.
 
 In October 2014, a sanitary napkin making unit was set up at the Coimbatore central prison. More than 90 male inmates are producing 2,400 sanitary napkins every day at the unit. The prison authorities send the sanitary napkins in the name of ‘Freedom’ to government hospitals across the state. The units make the convicts employable and would help them for their rehabilitation. The prison authorities are also giving training to the inmates to learn the techniques to manufacture the sanitary napkins.
