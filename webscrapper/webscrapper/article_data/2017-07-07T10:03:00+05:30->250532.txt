MUMBAI: The city is likely to get 100 buses—a mix of AC and non-AC ones— exclusively for   commuters, said BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde after a committee meeting on Thursday.

 “We are procuring the buses in phases and they will be deployed on busy office-going routes for women commuters during peak hours,” he said. The buses, which will be called ‘Tejasvini’ are being launched through an initiative by the state government, which had budgeted Rs 50 crore for the project last year. Similar buses will be launched in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and Nagpur, a source said.
 
 The buses will ply only during peak hours—7am to 11am and 5pm to 9pm—on feeder routes outside railway stations and ferry women commuters to  ,  , Nariman Point, Lower Parel and  , among other places. Officials said the buses are being introduced as there is a huge population of working women in Mumbai.
 
 The buses will be run by women conductors and drivers. Though Mumbai has 12 women conductors (Wadala depot), there is not a single woman driver at present and the undertaking will have to recruit them for this project. The BEST plans to procure midi AC buses for the project and a few ordinary red buses. During non-peak hours, the buses can ferry all passengers, an official said.
 
 Transport experts, however, questioned if the present infrastructure was adequate to run such a large number of buses for women only. “The BEST is already in bad shape, with buses not arriving on time. How can they run these extra services?” asked an expert.
