Chandigarh: Virender Singh (52) an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) committed suicide by shooting himself with his service revolver at the Murthal police station in Sonipat after uploading the suicide note on his Facebook wall on Wednesday. The ASI in his post held Sonipat municipal corporation councillor Vimal Kishore and his brother responsible for his death. He also blamed SP Ashwin Shenvi for delaying justice to him. Singh who hailed from Rohtak, had earlier attempted suicide by hanging himself. He was transferred to Sonipat two years ago. 

 Acting on the Facebook post, police have registered a case of abetment to suicide against the three at the Murthal police station. Singh who was posted at the Murthal police station, alleged that he had been shifted to the police lines following the complaint of Kishore for negligence of duty. 
 
 On April 15, Singh had gone to councillor Kishore’s place to attend a complaint filed by his brother against another brother. Though the matter was sorted out, Singh and a head constable were accused of using force. “Soon after getting the complaint the matter was referred to deputy superintendent of police (headquarters) Mukesh Jakhar who recommended shifting Singh from Murthal police station to the police line. It was a routine order and he was shifted on April 27. I never knew that he is so sensitive. He met me on Monday and apprised him about his part. I had assured justice to him as well,” said Shenvi who called the incident shocking.
