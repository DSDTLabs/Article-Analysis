INDORE: With the summer season approaching fast, residents of the city fear that they would face water scarcity like last year, despite assurances by the civic body that they have taken all the preventive measures and no past incident would be reported this year.

 “Development works have been carried out to improve the supply system in past one year. One of the major achievements is regularizing the water connections. We have regularized more than thousands of water connections. Deepening of ponds would also help us sustain water for long time this year,” said IMC’s water works department head  .
 
 Verma said that this has helped them measure the exact demand and also curb water theft and monitory losses due to it. The loss was estimated to be around 1 crore per month. 
 
 Large scale pond deepening activities were carried out during the year to increase the storage capacity of ponds. 
 
 IMC is also in the process of installing four new water pumps to increase supply in the city by 180 MLD during summers. Officials said that the work would be completed by May.
 
 “The project will cost us around Rs 7 crore. We already have two pumps with us, we will have to buy two more,” said Verma.
 
 Civic body officials said that currently they are able to pump around   out of which 350 MLD is supplied in the city. Rest gets waste during transmission.
 
 “We are not able to completely fill most tanks in the city due to lack of motors. With these new ones, the supply would become adequate,” Verma said.
 
 IMC is also working to reduce the   during transmission. “We are already in the process of changing pipelines in most parts of the city. Once we are able to curb the wastage, 540 MLD would be enough for the city and we will not face any crisis during the summer,” he added.
