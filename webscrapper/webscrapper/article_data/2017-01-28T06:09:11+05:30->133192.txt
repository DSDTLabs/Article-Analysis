LUCKNOW: Amethi assembly constituency seems to be headed for a 'friendly fire' between allies   and SP with  , the wife of Congress's UP campaign committee chief and erstwhile Amethi royal  , insisting on contesting from the seat. SP has already declared   as its candidate from the seat. 

  With Prajapati in the fray, Amita may contest as an independent, with outside support from Congress. TOI made several attempts to reach Amita for a confirmation, but she did not respond. 
 
  The seat could also witness a 'rani versus rani' battle as Amita wants to take on Sanjay's first wife, Garima Sinh, who is contesting on a BJP ticket. Congress insiders, however, told TOI that the 'friendly fight' between SP and Congress might, in fact, benefit both the alliance partners. On one hand, while this will pacify Amita, who is eager to contest against Garima, her candidature will also help Congress garner a clutch of upper caste Thakur and Brahmin votes that could elude Gayatri Prajapati, the Dalit minister in Akhilesh Yadav's cabinet. "Even if Amita Sinh contests as an independent the SP-Congress combine will dent BJP's votes," a Congress member said. Incidentally, BJP is also facing rebellion, with local leader Ashish Shukla edged out to accommodate Garima. 
 
  At several public functions, Amita has maintained that she will contest from the seat regardless of whether she gets Congress support. While Congress had been pushing for total control in the Gandhi pocketboroughs of Amethi and Rae Bareli, SP chief Akhilesh refused to part with any more than five assembly seats in the two Lok Sabha constituencies. 
 
 To show he is unwilling to negotiate, Akhilesh also declared two SP candidates in Amethi district - Gayatri Prajapati in Amethi and   - along with three candidates in Rae Bareli.
