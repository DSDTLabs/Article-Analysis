 “The situation is not so good as the wholesale onion prices have sharply declined. Farmers are not being able to manage even the production cost. There have been huge arrivals, but the demand is comparatively low. It costs around Rs 1,000 per quintal to grow onions and farmers incur losses if they get prices below that,” the official said.
