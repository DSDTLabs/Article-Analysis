Cops were informed about the incident following which an inquest under section 174 of the CrPC was initiated for further investigation.
 
 The second case also involved a Class IX girl who allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan at her house in outer Delhi’s  . Though no suicide note was found, police said she had failed her Class IX examination for the second time. 
 
 According to the police, the girl studied at a school near her residence and had returned home a couple of hours before she allegedly killed herself.
 
 Her mother told cops that her daughter had showed no signs of depression. “She was, however, a little upset for having failed again,” the girl’s mother said. 
 
 According to the police, she told her parents that she wanted to sleep and went to her room after having lunch.
