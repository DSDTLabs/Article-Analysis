CHENNAI: The traffic police have installed barricades on roads in the city and its suburbs to curb accidents but ironically these structures are turning out to be killers themselves. At least a dozen bike riders have died in Chennai, Tiruvallur and   in the first two months of this year after ramming into barricades. 

 In many cases, the accidents took place when the riders tried to negotiate curves without reducing their speed. Also, most of the bikers were not wearing helmets, resulting in fatal head injuries. Since there are no statistics maintained on how bike accidents are caused, the actual number of cases could be higher.
 
 In August last year, two judges of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court - K Sasidharan and   - had questioned whether the state police had any right to erect barricades on highways. Police say they install barricades to control the speed of vehicles as it is not possible to erect speed breakers everywhere. "But, even after installing reflectors on the barricades, bikers fail to notice them and end up losing their lives," said a traffic police official.
 
 These structures have turned out to be a means of free advertising for firms which volunteer to donate barricades with the names of their companies featuring prominently on the reflectors, while the names of the police stations get buried at the bottom. 
 
 "In the city, police personnel keep flickering lights to identify barricades but on the ECR, many stand in the middle of the road without proper reflectors, posing a danger for motorists and road users at night. This is also the case on the  ," said  , a lawyer.
