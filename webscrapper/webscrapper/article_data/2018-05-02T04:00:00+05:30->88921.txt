Rajkot: A 23-year-old man was brutally thrashed and his video made viral in Suraj Karadi village adjacent to salt town Mithapur. 

 Though the incident happened on April 28, it came to light on Tuesday after the video went viral in certain social media groups. 
 
 Investigating officer R K Patel told TOI that Roshiya has lodged a complaint for thrashing him and sections of the Prevention Atrocities Against SC/CT Act against Sikandar Pathan and his brother Salman and Hajabha Vahger. 
 
 The brothers, too, had earlier given an application of complaint against Roshiya for beating them up. 
 
 “There is some long-standing feud between them. Roshiya was beaten in the market over the same dispute. We are still to question them about the issue,” the police said.
