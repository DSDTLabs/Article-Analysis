CHENNAI: After veteran playback singer S P  's post on   about the legal notice that he received from his friend and music director  , there were heated discussions on social media among fans, actors and playback singers. 

 Illaiyaraja's legal team has sent a notice to SPB - who is on a world tour celebrating 50 years in the film industry - asking him to stop performing Illaiyaraja's songs because the practice breaks copyright laws.
 
 Madhan Karky, lyricist and screen-writer, said Illaiyaraaja was right legally, but "in the eyes of friendship, it doesn't seem right". Karky is the son of lyricist Vairamuthu, who had a fall out with Illaiyaraja in the '80s after many successful collaborations. Karky, on Twitter, said instead of a legal notice, a call could have solved the issue. 
 
 Entrepreneur and actor   tweeted that singers were last mile contributors in film music and that rights are shared between composer and producer in ratios that they deemed fit.
 
 But  , son of veteran singer K J Yesudas, disagreed with Karthik's comment and suggested that the way things were unfolding wasn't pleasant. He also pointed out that the system of rights and royalties was not exactly clean.
 
 Illaiyaraja fans pointed out that the veteran music composer prohibiting public performance of his songs without prior permission or royalty was a public knowledge for three years now.
 
 Twitter user @Raaga_Suresh, in a detailed post, said SPB should have pushed the organisers of his show to do the moral thing, which was to pay the royalty.
