Panaji: Flames engulfed old records and documents at the state transport department’s regional office (RTO) located at KTC’s Panaji bus terminus.  RTO Panaji officials reported damage in their enforcement section and office of registration (of vehicles and license issue). The flames have reportedly consumed many important records dating back to years before the smart card services were adopted by the Goa transport department. “All records have burnt and we will face severe problems. We may have to shut the RTO for a few days before we get back to normal,” said director of transport, Nikhil Desai. RTO inspectors also suspect that the blaze may have led to damage of over 20 computers. “The computer systems may have been affected . We will learn of the status only after the electricity is restored. The data has been backed up at the central server of the NIC,” said assistant director (North), transport, B A Sawant, who also heads the RTO Panaji. “NIC has RTO’s information since 2009. Whatever data we had prior to that, dating back to the 1960s, has been gutted in the fire. We will have to build up the information bank for the lost data all over again,” an RTO official said. For this, he informed that citizens who had registered their vehicles/received licenses prior to 2009 will either be asked to produce their documents or RTO officials will have to physically assess their vehicles before recording them. KTCL managing director, Derek Pereira Neto said that the transport department has asked for space around the KTC building to relocate their office for the time being. “We will have to see where we can accommodate the RTO Panaji within the premises so that citizens seeking registrations are not inconvenienced,” Neto said.  The RTO Panaji sees a footfall of approximately 400 persons a day, who start queuing up at 9.45am for various services.
