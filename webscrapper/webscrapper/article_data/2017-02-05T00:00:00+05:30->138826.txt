 and life were never separate in my experience. Spirituality is the basis of living life to the fullest. 

 Life has blessed me with a lot of success – even though success was never my ambition. My father,  , and I founded the brand in 1985, for the joy of creating beauty and quality, while being able to spend as much time as we could with our Master, Osho – he was alive at the time. 
 
 In 2006, I met Sadhguru and life became even more sweetly profound, with the experiential tools he offered. And having been with Osho, one realises that when there is a living, realised master among us — call him Buddha, Kabir, Krishna or Jesus — the most wonderful thing is to dedicate oneself to him. I sold the brand and my rights in the company and moved to Isha Yoga Center in 2010. Since then I have experienced more joy, fulfillment and depth of experience than ever before. It is not necessary to stop working to walk the path with a Master, but having worked for over 25 years, it was enough for me. More time in the business would have only resulted in a few more zeros at the bank or tall steel towers but no inner transformation.
