Gurgaon: Chief minister   will   the second flank of Hero Honda   on Monday. The eight-lane flyover will boost connectivity and ease snarls for the commuters going towards Sector 10, Basai, Sultanpur lake and Jhajjar district. 

 The 1.4-km-long flyover was constructed as part of three-layer crossing — flyover, underpass and existing roads — at the  . 
 
 Though the construction of the flyover was completed a few weeks ago, the national highway authority of India (NHAI) conducted load testing to ensure the safety parameters before it’s opened to traffic. According to NHAI estimates, around 50,000 vehicles will use the flyover every day. “Since a majority of these vehicles will be crossing the stretch during the rush hour, it is pertinent that the load testing was successful,” an NHAI official said.
 
 The Delhi-Jaipur side of the flyover was opened to traffic on March 27 this year. However, it was used as the carriageway for Jaipur-bound traffic also. The construction of the four-lane underpass is still on, and the authority intends to   it for commuters by December 31 this year. In fact, work on the underpass and the flyover picked up pace after waterlogging led to massive snarls at the crossing in July last year.
 
 “Besides the flyover, there will be 3.77km-long service lane. The flyover and service lane will cater to traffic coming from and going to Delhi, Gurgaon and Manesar. This will reduce the congestion for the daily commuters and bring relief to those living or working near the Hero Honda junction,” said Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI.
 
 Construction of the Rs 197.84-crore project began in November 2014, and was expected to be completed by May 2017. But initially, it was slowed down due to delay in clearance of land required for the project. Litigation, and lack of coordination between departments, delayed the clearance of the land required for the project.
