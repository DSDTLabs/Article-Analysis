KOLHAPUR:   (MP)   has demanded allocation of authorised stalls at railway stations to   for better placement of their food products.

 The official press statement from Mahadik said there are very few stalls available at railway stations and many railway stations are without such food stalls. “It paves way for illegal food vendors. Therefore, number of authorised food stalls need to increase and women self-help groups should be included for allocation of stalls,” the letter read.
 
 It further said that Railway minister assured that a policy is being designed in such a way that food stalls would be given to local people having residential certificates. Women self-help groups have supported this move.
 
 Member of a local self-help group Seema Patil said, “Self-help groups need a better place to sell their products. If we get food stalls, a group can buy items from us and sell it to the passengers. It can become a chain and become good market place.”
 
 Member of zonal railway users’ consultative committee Shivnath Biyani said, “This is a good move. We will raise similar demand with central railway manager. It would provide good market place and employment for women groups.”
