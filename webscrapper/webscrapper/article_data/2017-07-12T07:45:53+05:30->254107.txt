CHANDIGARH: It was a smoother centralised admission process on the second day at Guru Gobind Singh College for Women, Sector-26, after the authorities beefed up security and other arrangements. The candidates for the BSc non-medical seats under the UT pool general category and even their parents had enough chairs.

 The police presence inside and outside the college was reassuring. There was seating arrangements for even the crowd waiting outside the venue. “The waiting didn’t exhaust us, as the seating arrangements are good,” said Rajesh Kumar, father of a candidate. The hiccups of Monday had forced the authorities to change the system of screening the documents. The scrutiny happened in a sequence. “There was no problem in verification, and I got through the process easily,” said candidate Ananya Mishra.
 
 The student volunteers looked vigilant and ready to help. “The addressed all our queries about the merit list and guided us through the process,” said Sunita Gupta, mother of a candidate from Sector 20. The college had deployed water coolers for the visitors. Looking at the chances of rain, the paramedical team had been moved indoors. “I like the availability of paramedical aid. I have never seen it before,” said candidate Raghav Chander.
 
 The division of candidates into small batches ensured that the three-stage procedure from the registration to confirmed admission ran uninterrupted. Even a dysfunctional projector screen from the opening day was now in working order.
