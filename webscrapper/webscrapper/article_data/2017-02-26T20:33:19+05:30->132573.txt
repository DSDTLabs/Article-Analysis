'The Sixth Sense' star   was   Thursday morning after police responded to a disturbance call at her home. 

  
  
 Officers responded to multiple calls around 7:15 am (5:45 pm IST) about a disturbance coming from her   apartment. Upon arriving at her residence, officers found the 31-year-old actress with a guest. 
 
 According to   of West Hollywood Sheriff's Department, Barton, who is best known for her role as   on the hit show 'The OC', was 'fully clothed' and 'speaking in coherent statements' before she willingly went to the hospital. 
 
 However, she was transported for a mental evaluation. This comes after Barton celebrated her birthday here with friends.
