 is one busy girl – when she is not shooting for her films, she is sifting through scripts that can be produced by her production house. 

 After a long, hard day of work, the actress likes to unwind with ‘that special someone’. Now, before you jump the gun, let us tell you we’re not talking about her alleged beau  . We meant her furry friend Dude. It’s no secret that Anushka dotes on her dog and recently, the actress even posted an adorable picture of her cuddling up with Dude. She captioned the picture as, “Puppy lovin #NoFilter beautiful sunset.” Isn’t it oh-so-cute?
