NEW DELHI:   visited   on Saturday and stressed on the importance of such parks in the capital. 

 He spoke about the role of biodiversity parks in giving   to several birds and animal species. This was Baijal’s first visit as LG. Officials showed him photographs of him laying the foundation stone at the park. 
 
 “The LG had visited the park when it was formed so he was curious about the development that had taken place since then,” said a Yamuna Biodiversity Park official. 
 
 The LG, along with wife Mala Baijal, took a walk through the medicinal garden, herbal park, butterfly park and the waterbodies that have been restored there. He appreciated the efforts made to preserve them and directed DDA to form a separate body to manage biodiversity parks. “There is an urgent need to revive the lost ecosystems of the Yamuna,” the LG said.
 
 Baijal also saw the newly-developed Phase-II of the park where a leopard recently became resident and Phase-I where a barking deer was spotted. Officials at the park have requested the LG to consider their request of getting a 12-foot fence built in Phase-II of the park, which will ensure that any animal coming to the park stays inside. “This will reduce the risk to locals as earlier they were worried that the leopard might escape,” said an official.
 
 Citing it as a ‘fully functional ecosystem’, the LG lauded the efforts of the DDA vice-chairman, the team of professor CR Babu and DDA officials.
