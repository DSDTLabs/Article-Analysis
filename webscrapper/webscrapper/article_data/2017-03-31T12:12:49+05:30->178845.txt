 "We will stay customer-centric and will support digital transformation in all industries, in order to create value for our customers and to grow sustainably," he added. 
 
 India continues to be one of the key focus areas for the company in the Asia-Pacific region. The company set up a global service centre in Bangalore last year. Jay Chen, CEO,  , told TOI," With the 4G network rollout, sustained growth in smartphones, and our growing capabilities in enterprise and industry solutions, we continue to witness strong growth across all our businesses in India."
