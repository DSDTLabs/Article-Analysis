MUMBAI: Almost six months after the   (NCPCR) set up a website to allow children to complain against cases of  , the city’s education department has told its schools to put up the instructions on notice-boards to spread awareness.

 The   e-box is a direct medium for reporting cases of sexual assault under Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Students can log on to the website and select from six pictures to describe the nature of the complaint, enter contact details and write some lines about the incident. But since its inception in August 2016 till last week, the portal received only 178 complaints from across the country. Of these, only 22 complaints were actionable, said officials. 
 
 According to a circular issued to schools in Mumbai south zone, they will have to put up a notice on the board making students aware about the mechanism. “It is evident from recent incidents that there has been an increase in crime against children. Such incidents affect the mental health of children and could lead to depression. The children most often do not have anyone to share their troubles with and hence fall prey to crimes repeatedly,” said the circular. 
 
 Education officials also plan hold sessions for principals to help spread the word. “Teachers can speak to children and build confidence that they do not need to hide incidents of sexual abuse. But for that, teachers too need to be trained. So we will hold sessions for faculty,” said Nitin Bachav, education inspector, north zone, Mumbai. 
 
 “There is a great need for awareness and this can be achieved through schools because that is where children spend a lot of time. We could also look at setting up a mobile application to make it more accessible to children as they often use their parents’ phone and are well-versed with using it,” said an NCPCR official.
