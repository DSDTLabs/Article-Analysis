GORAKHPUR: The call to   supporters to vote and work for the SP candidate in the bypolls was made by BSP’s chief zonal coordinator Ghanshyam Singh Kharwar at a public meeting in Taramandal here on Sunday.

 SP candidate Pradeep Nishad and the party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s emissary MLC Udaiveer Singh were also present in the meeting.
 
 “Behenji has decided that we must work towards making this man (Pradeep Nishad), from a backward community, win against BJP. We call upon the entire BSP cadre to campaign for him and ensure he wins,” Kharwar told a joint gathering of SP and BSP supporters.
 
 Nishad told TOI that BSP’s support would ensure a victory for him. “BSP is now totally in favour of us. Its cadre is highly disciplined and will help us. We have started a campaign called ‘reach voter, teach voter’ through which we are telling people how BJP has failed at every level and how, because of that, Gorakhpur has witnessed incidents like the medical college deaths of so many children,” he said.
 
 The supporters raised slogans like “Pichron daliton ke samman me Behanji maidan me” (Myawati is in field in honour of backwards and downtrodden) and “Mil gaye Mulayam Kanshiram, hawa me udd gye Jai Shri Ram”.
 
 SP and BSP will campaign separately for Praveen Nishad. However, Nishad Party president and Praveen's father,  , said that from Monday onwards campaign vehicles would sport four party flags, those of SP, Nishad Party, Peace Party and BSP.
