CHENNAI: With fire being a potential threat at makeshift tree  , Greater Chennai Corporation cleared   and garden garbage from 19 out of 78 earmarked locations. 

 More than 100 fires have erupted across the city in the past three weeks at these sites due to the piling up of dry leaves and twigs apart from heavy wood. Officials are in a race to transport the cyclone-felled garden waste to the landfills in Kodungaiyur and Perungudi.
 
 “Before   (on January 13) we would clear all the locations,” said a senior corporation official. “Our staff are segregating the wood, for auction, from dry leaves and twigs which will go to landfills. We have not weighed this garden waste yet.”
 
 Three days ago, intelligence officials had warned the home department to clear the trees before Bhogi to prevent the potential threat of fires affecting neighbourhoods and other healthy trees. After the cyclone on December 12 had knocked down thousands of trees, corporation acted quickly to clear them from roads, private, public and commercial places and stored the dead trees and dumped them in 78 open spaces across the city. It was meant to be temporary measure so that the corporation could save time and trips made to the landfills whilst residents could simultaneously cart their waste to earmarked locations. But there was inordinate delay in moving these to the landfills as the corporation had to call out for three e-auctions for 49,960 metric tonnes of windfallen wood.
