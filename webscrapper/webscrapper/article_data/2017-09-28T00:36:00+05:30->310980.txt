Salem: A 28-year-old   was placed under suspension here on Wednesday for helping prisoners with mobile phone.

 Following a tip that S Ganesan, a second grade constable at the Salem Central Prison, used to help prisoners with mobile phone to communicate with their family and friends, superintendent of Salem Central Prison M Andal had issued a departmental inquiry against him.
 
 A source at the central jail said the prison superintendent, who always monitors the activities of officials inside the prison, came to know that Ganesan had two days ago brought a mobile phone and helped a few inmates.
 
 “He helped a few notorious history-sheeters to talk to their friends,” the officer said.
 
 When Andal confronted him, Ganesan confessed to the crime. Andal subsequently issued him suspension order on Wednesday.
 
 The prison superintendent also warned other constables against helping prisoners with mobile phones.
