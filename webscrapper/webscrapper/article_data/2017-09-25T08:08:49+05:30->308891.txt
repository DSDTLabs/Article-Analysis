 That's when police inspector S Chandru learned about his story and decided that it was his duty to help. The inspector, attached to the Vadapalani police station, admitted Senthil to a private hospital.
 
 The officer said Senthil lived with his mother and sister at South Sivan Koil Street in Kodambakkam. A heavy user of tobacco products, Senthil was diagnosed with oral cancer a year ago. But he would not stay in a hospital for more than two days and his wife soon abandoned him. 
 
 When his condition grew worse, a neighbour made him admit himself to Royapettah Government Hospital.
 
 "Senthil told his mother that nurses at the hospital refused to allow him to stay because, they said, his 'condition was incurable'," said inspector Chandru who admitted Senthil to   in Maduravoyal.
 
 "I only helped Senthil in a small way," Chandru said. "People should realise chewing tobacco products and smoking leads to cancer."
