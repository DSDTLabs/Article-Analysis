Tirupur: A police constable, who was caught in inebriated state while on duty on Saturday night in the city, was placed under suspension by the city police commissioner on Monday.

 The constable, K Alexander, who was working in the law and order wing at the Tirupur north police station, was conducting vehicle checks at a police checkpost on Uthukuli Road at Mannarai on Saturday night. 
 
 He was accompanied by another constable from the armed police force. “They were directed to inspect vehicles thoroughly to curb crimes. But, Alexander, who was the senior among the two, was constantly talking over walkie-talkie even when he was not asked to,” said a senior police officer. Alexander even passed unnecessary comments about himself, the officer added.
 
 When the officer who was in charge of patrolling duty reached the spot to check up on Alexander, he found the constable in inebriated state, the officer said. 
 
 On inquiry on Sunday, Alexander, who was transferred from the Tirupur south police two months ago, said he had blabbered over the walkie-talkie because of frustration caused by hectic working condition in the city, the officer said.
 
 Following this, the Tirupur north police recommended to place him under suspension. City police commissioner P Nagarajan passed an order over this on Monday.
