Cleared/325 Words (Francis)Madurai: The greatest Tamil literary work Thirukkural is the only book that guides the whole world and everyone needs to follow it and pass it on to their heirs, justice R Mahadevan of the Madras high court said in a function held on the premises of the high court bench on Tuesday.

 On April 26, last year, the judge directed the state government to finalise syllabus containing 108 chapters of Arathuppal and Porutpal in Thirukkural and include it in the curriculum for school children from Classes 8 to 12.
 
 Adhering to it, the school education department passed a government order in March this year. Meanwhile, teacher D Suriyakumar of the government girls higher secondary school in Melur in Madurai designed books for Classes 8 to 12 containing contents of chapters as the high court said. 
 
 To laud his efforts, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court Bar Association (MMBA) held a function on Tuesday. Speaking on the occasion, justice R Mahadevan said imparting moral education to school students is the need of the hour.
 
 “The court’s direction to the government to teach 108 chapters of Thirukkural is the impact of a system followed in England. As per the system, the government decided to give Shakespeare’s literary works to poor people free of cost, who were unable to buy them. It brought about a remarkable change in the society as the people started speaking about dialogues in those literary works over the period,” the judge said. 
 
 He further said that Thirukkural is the only work to guide the whole world. “We will follow it and take it forward to our heirs,” he said. 
 
 President of MMBA, K Samidurai said the then British government had passed a government order to teach Thirukkural in schools. Now, it is justice Mahadevan who has completed the task through his order, he said. 
 
 Sschool headmistress T Daisy Nirmala Rani, MMBA representatives J Alaguramjothi, M Siddharthan and C Guhaseelarupan participated.
