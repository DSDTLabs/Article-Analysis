AHMEDABAD: Crime branch sleuths on Thursday arrested a gang of four persons who would allegedly pose as passengers in rickshaws and steal valuables and cash from co-passengers. Three of the gang are from Surat and two of these, Abduljabbar Shaikh and Imrankhan Pathan of   in Surat, have been booked for assault by   police in Surat district.

 Crime branch officials said other two arrested are Firozekhan Pathan of Vatva and Hussainkhan Pathan of Bhestan. “All four were arrested together near Bhulabhai Park in Shah-e-Alam, travelling in a rickshaw without a registration number,” said a crime branch official.
 
 Inspector Rajesh Suvera of crime branch said the gang was nabbed following a tip-off. “They confessed to committing 27 such offences in Ahmedabad and eight in Surat. We are also probing if they are involved in similar offences in other cities,” added Suvera.
 
 Suvera said all of the accused are related and knew each other before they chose to pursue crime.
 
 “They had a unique modus operandi. One would stand outside a railway station or bus depot, posing as a shared-rickshaw driver and three would pose as passengers. They would identify passengers they thought were carrying valuables,” added a senior crime branch official.
 
 Police sources said they would then make the victim sit between the three and would pinch valuables, cell phones or cash from the victim’s luggage or pockets.
 
 “The driver would later pretend that the auto had developed snag and tell the victim to get off midway,” said a crime branch source.
 
 Investigators said they recovered six stolen mobiles, cash and the stolen auto they were in when they were arrested.
