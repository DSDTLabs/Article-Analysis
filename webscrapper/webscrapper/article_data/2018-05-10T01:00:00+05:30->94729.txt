Led by the foul-mouthed   as   and  , who returns as Cable post playing Thanos in his last big-ticket outing, Deadpool 2 is one of the most-awaited superhero films, thanks to its quirky sense of humour.
The hilarious trailers have already hinted on the fun to expect, but what’s left to see is the upgrade that Deadpool has got since his last installment. He also continues to showcase the dark humour of the no-holds-barred kind that made the character 
 such a favourite among the audience.
 
 Speaking of the sequel, this time around Deadpool goes on a mission to rescue a child from Cable and creates a super team of heroes, called the X Force. Ryan Reynolds explained, “Playing a guy who is allowed to make mistakes and is allowed to sort of be offensive and say the wrong thing at the exact wrong moment gives you tremendous artistic liberty. And it’s nice that he doesn’t really beat himself up for it, because at the end of the day, his agenda is something that's ultimately good. I mean, he inevitably wants to be better.”
 
 Deadpool 2 releases on May 18.
