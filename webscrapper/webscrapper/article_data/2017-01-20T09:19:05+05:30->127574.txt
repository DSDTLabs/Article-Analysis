VADODARA: Taking cue from - Goats can be a source of income- a group of doctors, IT professionals and bank executives have decided to distribute goats to 40 tribal families of Zalod in Dahod on Friday.

 ‘Submission or Mission’ is a group that has been active since long in installing bore wells in tribal villages in the state and near   border. After surveying some villages, the group has identified 40 families to whom they will distribute goats for their sustenance.
 
 “The idea is to distribute the goats so that the families can sell the milk and earn regular income. Once the families start to earn they can send their children to school instead of labour work,” said  , a member of the group. He added that even if they do not sell the milk, they can use it for their own use.
 
 The group decided to distribute goats because it is cheaper than other milch animals. Shendre said, “Apart from the cost part, the families live in an area where it is difficult to find fodder for the animals. Since goats can survive on even thorny plants, it will be easy to find food for the animal.”
 
 The group members have said that a goat costs around Rs 3,000, the families can even sell the goats’ offspring and earn additional money from it. For the project, the group has raised money from their friends and their own salaries.
 
 The cash crunch situation delayed the distribution of the goats. “The people from whom we are going to buy the goats want the payment in cash. Since the donations that we had received was deposited in bank, we will now have to first withdraw the money and then make the payments,” Shendre told TOI.
 
 Apart from this project and installing the bore wells, the group had given kits comprising household essentials like rice, edible oil, sugar, grams and a pair of saris to widows and abandoned elderly women in 2015.
