PANAJI: A delegation of   leaders, led by  , called on governor Mridula Sinha on Monday demanding that a session of the Goa assembly be convened at the earliest. The assembly session was adjourned on February 22 due to chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s ill health. “It was the duty of the ruling party to suo motu take initiative and convene a session,” Naik said. 

 In a memorandum to Sinha, the delegation demanded that the government issue regular updates on Parrikar’s health. “We are unaware of the exact status,” Naik said.
 
 Raising the issue of the legality of setting up a cabinet advisory committee (CAC), the delegation also asked for a white paper on the decisions taken by the government from the date of the adjournment of the House till date. It has demanded that the decisions taken by the committee, except those taken on humanitarian ground, be quashed and set aside.
 
 Alleging lack of governance in the state, the party demanded Sinha’s intervention and pointed out that the council of ministers must be appointed by the governor. 
 
 The party also objected to cabinet decisions being taken via video conferencing, stating that “no such rules for cabinet decisions through video conferencing have been framed by the government.”
 
 Opposition leader   said the government lacked seriousness in tackling the mining issue.
