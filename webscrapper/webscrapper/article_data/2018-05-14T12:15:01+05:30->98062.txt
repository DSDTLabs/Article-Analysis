 star   had a   encounter on a plane with a fan who paid little attention to his sick bride. According to a report, The   star is used to being recognized in public, but one encounter with a pair of newlyweds was particularly 'surreal' because it occurred as the man's severely ill wife was being carried off the aircraft.

  
  
 "I was on a plane with a honeymooning couple and the bride became very ill - not just throwing up ill...," he recalled. However, despite the woman's health issues, Reynolds explained that the husband's attention wasn't entirely focused on the emergency situation.
 
 "She was taken off the plane on a stretcher, it was so bad," the actor said. "As her new husband followed her out, he spotted me and shouted: 'Deadpool! High five!'"
 
 "It was a surreal moment - firstly, I didn't want to high five him just in case he was infected, and secondly, he seemed to have no concern for his dying wife!" he continued.
