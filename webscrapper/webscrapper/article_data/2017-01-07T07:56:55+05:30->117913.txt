CHENNAI: Some of the finest khadi weaving communities of the country have set up shop in the city in an effort to bring attention to the dying  . 

  On Friday, national award winning director Vetrimaran and actors Rohini and Revathi inaugurated at   a three-day exhibition-cum-sale featuring Bengal muslin, Gujarat's kala cotton, khadi from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and garments woven with recycled plastic.
 
 Known world over as one of the lightest garments, Bengal muslin saris are on display with kurtas, handbags and cloth. Organic cotton hand-spun, handwoven, naturally-dyed and hand-stitched, handloom products provide livelihood to farmers, spinners, weavers, dyers and tailors. After agriculture, weaving provides the largest employment in the country.
 
 One spinning mill can spell the end to the livelihood of 50,000 to 1 lakh weavers. The weaving community operates in a decentralised structure in which women account for 90% of the workforce. It leaves the rural economy in the hands of women who can pass on the skill and learning to their children. With the rise of mechanised spinning, weavers have been left with no alternate source of livelihood.
 
 Tula founder Ananthoo, who has set up a stall at the venue, said, "We have to bring self-respect to weavers and also make weaving commercially viable." Weavers today make just 150 a day at 12-15 per metre of cloth spun. Low pay is forcing many to move out of the sector. 
 
  'Khamir', a group which works with traditional craftsmen of Kachchh in Gujarat, has come up with an innovative possible solution to waste management by weaving with recycled plastic using traditional skills. The practice also provides jobs to rag pickers.
 
 The exhibition will be on till Sunday.
