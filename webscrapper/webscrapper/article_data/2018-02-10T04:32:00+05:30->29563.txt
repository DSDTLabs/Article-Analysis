MUMBAI: The decomposed body of a 65-year-old man was found in a 4-BHK flat in a highrise in Colaba. The deceased,  , a divorcee, lived alone in the 30th-floor flat in   building, the police said. 

 The matter came to light on Thursday afternoon when the building watchman went to Kabli's flat to report about water seeping from his house into the flat below his. As the watchman failed to get any response, he informed the building management. A foul smell that pervaded on the floor and around the flat, spurred the management to summon the police. Kabli's body was discovered after the police and firemen broke open the door to the flat. 
 
 Kabli's ex-wife lived in   while his sons are settled in the US and the other in Oman, said the police. "The flat was in a state of disarray," said an officer. "Power had been cut off two years ago due to unpaid bills."
 
 The police said they have informed Kabli's former wife and sons. "She has refused to claim the body. We are now waiting for his sons to arrive," said the police officer.
 
 The body has been sent for a post-mortem. "As of now, we have taken custody of the body," said deputy commissioner of police   Sharma. TNN
