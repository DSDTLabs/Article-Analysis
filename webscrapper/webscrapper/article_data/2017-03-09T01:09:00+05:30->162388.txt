MUMBAI: The opposition has questioned the state government’s “transparency” a day after TOI’s report on the transfer of a bureaucrat after he raised concerns about the price waiver on land, which was later allotted to Baba Ramdev’s   Ltd.

 “If a senior official is transferred because he brings up relevant concerns, then this raises serious questions about the so-called transparency of the state government,” said NCP leader  .
 
  Every finance secretary will raise questions when there is likely to be a loss of revenue, added Patil who has served as finance minister in the Congress-NCP regime.
 
 TOI had reported that senior bureaucrat Bijay Kumar, then principal secretary financial reforms was transferred in April 2016, three weeks after he had raised questions about the lack of detailed financial calculations on the waiver. 
 
 Documents procured through the Right to Information Act showed that he raised these concerns in a subcommittee appointed by the state to recommend land price for a food park in the Mihan area in Nagpur.
 
 The subcommittee later recommended a 75% waiver on the land price then dropped from Rs 1 crore to Rs 25 lakh per acre. Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd was later awarded 230 acres of the land after it emerged as the sole bidder. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has said the transfer was routine. 
 
 He said the allotment process was transparent and took place only after inviting bids. Fadnavis said the government wanted to encourage food parks in the area and most of the land remained empty.
 
 The opposition has demanded more details on the allotment. “It almost seems as if the whole exercise was prearranged since Baba Ramdev’s firm was the sole bidder,” said Patil.
