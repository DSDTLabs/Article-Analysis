COIMBATORE: A city-based Hindu group has announced that they would be conducting rekla races, jallikattu and manju virattu, regardless of whether the   and Centre approved these events. According to them, banning traditional sports was detrimental to Tamil culture. It also threatened the sustanence of native breeds. 

 Members of   walked into the district collectorate with roosters and a bull attacked to a cart, stating that traditional sporting games that were century-old traditions, are being threatened by animal activists and the state government has done nothing to protect these games. "Regardless of whether the Supreme Court gives approval, we will conduct these games from January 15," said  , the founder of the outfit.
 
 The organisation even announced the probable locations for the events. "We will conduct cock fights along with Silambam and   on Big Bazaar Road on January 15. Bull taming events like Jallikattu and Manju Virattu will be conducted on the outskirts like Thondamuthur," said Jaleendran.
 
 It was only in mid-November that the Supreme Court again rejected the state government's plea to review the ban on jallikattu. "The court is banning the sports based on the pleas of a few animal rights organisations. One organisation is not even from Tamil Nadu," said Jaleendran. "We admit that some people may have fed their animals with alcohol, drugs and hormones to boost performance. They may even have tortured them with chilli powder. All these cruelties need to be banned. Give us a set of guidelines for conducting these sports. Officers could also be deployed to monitor these events. But completely banning these sports defies reason," he said.
