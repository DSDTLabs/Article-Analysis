LUCKNOW: Eager to rev up her political prospects through Dalit-Muslim consolidation in the polls, BSP chief   on Tuesday managed to elicit the support of   (JPS), an organisation representing the Most Backward Castes (MBCs) in eastern UP. Though a little known outfit, the   managed to get 2.3% votes in 35 seats it contested in the 2012 assembly polls. Its state president,   Thakur, got more than 11% votes in Madhuban assembly seat in Mau district in the last polls. The group is primarily dominated by people from Rajbhar, Kashyap, Nishad, Dhobi and Mochi communities, who are also being strongly wooed by BJP. 

 For Mayawati, support from even a smaller political outfit representing MBCs could be significant considering the dent her party received after the exit of former minister and leader of Opposition Swami Prasad Maurya, an MBC. Former MP and BSP leader in  , Dara Singh Chauhan too had deserted her and joined BJP. 
 
 Formed just before 2007 assembly polls, JPS has been raising various demands of MBCs in political circles. Its national president Om Prakash Chauhan told TOI that a delegation of five members met Mayawati and extended their party’s support to BSP. According to Chauhan, JPS would stay away from assembly elections this time and its members would instead gather support for BSP. 
 
 “The MBCs have been demanding reservation within the OBC quota but no political party ever bothered to look into the demands,” Chauhan said. 
 
 The recent decision of the ruling   to include 17 OBC castes in the SC/ST list will not solve the problem of discrimination, he added.
