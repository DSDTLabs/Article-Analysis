NOIDA: The CBI has sought the   Authority’s permission to prosecute three of its officials who have been charged in the multi-crore-rupee tenders scam allegedly masterminded by  , Noida’s former engineer-in-chief. 

 The central investigating agency has written to Noida CEO  . “We will extend complete support to the investigating agency,” Prasad said. “All details and information sought will be provided without delay.” 
 
 But Prasad refused to divulge the names of the three officers the CBI was seeking sanction to prosecute.
 
 Officials said the permission from the appropriate authority was mandatory for prosecution of a public servant in criminal cases, including under the Prevention of Corruption Act. It has to be obtained before a court takes cognisance of an offence, whether under the IPC or any other law.
 
 The CBI has so far arrested four people, besides Singh, in the case — Noida junior engineer J P Singh, assistant project engineer Ramendra, believed to be a key aide of Singh, Vinod Kumar Goyal, managing partner of Tirupati Construction, and another suspect. All four are currently in judicial custody in Dasna jail and have been charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, fraud and under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
 
 Four more Noida officials — Devi Ram Arya, Rajeev Kumar, R D Sharma and Ompal Singh — are among those accused in the case. The CBI had in March last year filed a 32-page chargesheet in the case in which 11 people and three firms were named (other than Tirupati Construction, NKG Infrastructure and JSP Constructions). The scam relates to the laying of underground cables at Noida’s Udyog Marg and Mater Plan 1 road, which allegedly caused a loss of crores of rupees to the exchequer.
