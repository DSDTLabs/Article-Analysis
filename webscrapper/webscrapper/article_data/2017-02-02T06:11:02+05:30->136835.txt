NEW DELHI:   is understood to have found no issues with  's contentious   that have been challenged by rivals like Airtel and Vodafone for being "in violation" of the regulator's rules. 

  Top sources said that Trai is likely to follow the opinion given by the attorney general (AG) on the matter. Trai had sent the issue to the AG, who is believed to have found  's tariff plans in order and in line with existing regulations. "There is no issue to intervene with Jio's tariffs, and we do not find them predatory" Trai sources said. 
 
  Trai told the Delhi HC on Wednesday that it has taken a decision on representations by various telecom service providers against Jio's offers, and this would be communicated to the challengers on Thursday. 
 
  Trai, however, did not disclose its decision to the court. It said it will submit its decision before the court by the next date of hearing on February 6. The submission by TRAI came during the hearing of a plea by Vodafone which claimed that the regulator failed to prohibit "blatant violation" of its tariff orders, directions and regulations by Jio by permitting it to continue with its free offers.
