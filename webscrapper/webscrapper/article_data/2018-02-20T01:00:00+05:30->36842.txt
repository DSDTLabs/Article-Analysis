With   all set to start shooting for his yet-untitled film with debutant  , co-starring  , from March, the pre-production work for it is on in full swing. While the actor has already started prepping to look his part as a youngster in his late 20s, we hear that   has finished composing the tunes already. What’s interesting is that the composer travelled to all the locations where the song would be picturised on its cast to come up with the tunes.

 A source in the know fills us in, “It’s a travel film and Karthi has been training hard to get into the character of a man in his late 20s. Meanwhile, Harris was so excited with the way the script moves forward that he wanted to visit the locations the characters in the film will be travelling to, and where the songs will be shot; he composed the songs in the exact locations where they will be filmed. He met a lot of youngsters to understand the way this generation thinks. It took the team about two weeks to finish composing.”
