NAGPUR: The harrowing tale of a 40-year-old city woman, sold as a ' ' in Hail city of   for 2 lakh through an international trafficking racket, has been taken lightly by city police. Akila Begum, the city-based agent who sold the woman, was rounded up by Sakkardara police after the FIR was registered last week. 

 However, she was not arrested, and released so she could attend a marriage.
 
  Hamida (name changed), mother of a 13-year-old boy, had to run pillar to post to get an offence registered. The police had registered the FIR only last week, after a delay of 50 days, despite instructions from the CP office in mid-March. Those booked include Akila Begum, Abdullah, Saudi Arabian national Asma Madam, and her brothers Khalid, Mujaheed and Hammand. 
 
 Last year, Akila had befriended Hamida on a bus, and offered her a job in Saudi Arabia with a monthly pay package of 20,000. 
 
  Akila had later taken Hamida to Mumbai and introduced her to Abdullah near CST Station in August 2016. In September, Hamid and several other women were flown to Sharjah from Jaipur. 
 
  In Saudi Arabia, Hamida was handed over to Asma and her family. They made her work from 6am to 11pm, tortured her mentally and physically. 
 
 They also refused to pay her salary, claiming they had purchased her as a slave for 2 lakh. Asma's male relatives even made undue advances, prompting Hamida to flee from captivity. 
 
 "Since they had purchased me as a slave, they wanted the money back to allow me to return," Hamida told TOI. 
 
  "I was helped by a local person, who alerted police in Hail. The cops handed me over to the Indian Embassy, which helped me return to India after a long stay at the protection house. I landed in Hyderabad penniless and travelled to Nagpur without tickets in January. After several attempts, I was helped by a friend to contact the CP office in March," she said.
