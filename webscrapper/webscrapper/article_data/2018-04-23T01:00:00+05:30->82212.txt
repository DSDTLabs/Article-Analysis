 She recently took all her domestic staff on a pilgrimage to Banaras. The all-women group made a three-day trip to the holy city, during the course of which they attended the Ganga Aarti, visited various temples and savoured the local delicacies.

She decided to leave all the children behind with her husband, since he is equally adept at handling baby duties,” says a source close to the filmmaker duo.
