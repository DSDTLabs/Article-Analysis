However, no decision was taken about cancelling or conducting the exam once a year.
 
 Meanwhile, the UGC-NET exam was held on January 22 earlier this year. CBSE conducted NET in 100 subjects at 90 selected exam cities. There were 500 centres in 90 cities. Interestingly, the NET was conducted by the UGC till 2014, following which it was handed over to the CBSE.
 
 A NET candidate from Kolhapur said, “The CBSE needs to give clear instructions regarding the exam. Ideally for students, it should be conducted twice a year.”
 
 The NET enables the candidates to receive the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) of the UGC and makes them eligible for being appointed as lecturer in the   universities across the country.
