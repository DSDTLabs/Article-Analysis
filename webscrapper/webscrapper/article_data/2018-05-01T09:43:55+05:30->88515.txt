BENGALURU: Ten gold, six silver and seven bronze medals. And a whopping 97% in the second   arts examinations with a centum in psychology! That is   player Archana Kamath’s score this year.

 
 
 The 17-year-old stood out yet again as a shining example of an athlete who has struck the right balance between studies and sport, just like she did two years back when she was ranked ninth in  , scoring an impressive 617/625 (98.72%).
 
 This year, Archana got 582/600, effectively the ninth rank in Karnataka, but what came as a bigger surprise is that she attended college for just one day, busy as she was with national and international tournaments for the better part of the academic year.
 
 Archana’s performance in 2017-18 puts her achievements in perspective. She played 21 tournaments (7 national and 14 international) from April 2017 to March 2018, bagging a total of 23 medals.
 
 Backed well by the   (JC Road), Archana made the most of the time she got during national training camps to study. “It was near impossible for her to study during tournaments. Whatever little time she got she utilised well,” her father Girish Kamath, a noted eye specialist in the city, told TOI on Monday.
 
 Textbooks were her constant companions, as was mother Anuradha, who helped the 17-year-old maintain composure and poise during camps and national tournaments. “Archana would focus on studies in the morning and have a good game of table tennis in the evening. She used to say she felt rejuvenated while playing the game because she had done something positive by studying earlier in the day,” Kamath said.
