NEW DELHI: Four members of a gang were   in west Delhi’s Janakpuri for posing as Delhi Police   and robbing people. 

 The gang was formed by Rohit whose childhood dream was to become a police officer. He and the other members — Pawan, Suraj and Deepak — used fake ID cards and uniforms to convince people that they were policemen. 
 
 The gang offered lifts to people on Pankha Road and later, they robbed them. “They committed 150 such crimes in the last three years,” said Vijay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (west). Police said a businessman, Dinesh Kumar, had called them and said that two policemen had robbed him and threw him out of his car. “A case was registered and a team led by ACP (Operations) Jagjeet Singh Sangwan started investigation,” said the DCP.
 
 The complainant, Dinesh Kumar, said that one of the gang members started talking to him when he was waiting for transport. Soon, a car stopped next to them and the occupants introduced themselves as sub-inspectors Satbir and Rajbir. They offered them a lift. “I did not doubt them as they had uniforms on,” Kumar said. 
 
 Police said that the men had a wireless set that suddenly got a message. The accused then asked Kumar to hand over his belongings to them for verification. Kumar gave them his cellphone, cash, and ATM card and pin. They withdrew Rs 80,000 from Kumar’s account and shopped using his cards.
