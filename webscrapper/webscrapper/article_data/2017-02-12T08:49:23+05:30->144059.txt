GURUGRAM/NUH: No toilet, no bride. This is the message that has been sent across by residents of 110 villages from three neighbouring states —  ,   and   — in a sweeping move to inculcate healthy habits and curb   in rural areas.

 Around 1,200 villagers from the three states took part in a panchayat at Tiwara village in Punahana sub-division of Nuh, around 100 km from Gurgaon, on Thursday and unanimously decided to not marry their daughters into households which do not have toilets. They have also decided to ban liquor consumption and DJ music at weddings to check overheads, the burden of which often fall on brides’ families.
 
 Led by around 100 ulemas and maulanas, the participants, mostly from the Muslim community, decided to launch an awareness campaign as a part of the Swachh Bharat mission and took a resolution to eradicate social evils. 
 
 “Open defecation is not only an unhygienic habit, but also it often leads to crime against women, especially since most women have to step out of homes in the dark. So, unless a groom has a toilet at his house, he won’t get a bride,” said maulana Yahya Karimi, a resident of Tiwara village, who chaired the panchayat.
 
 The panchayat served as a platform to facilitate several other measures aimed at cutting wedding expenses often borne by the bride's side.
 
 “Also if any member of a baraat is found to have consumed alcohol when the groom and his friends and relatives reach the wedding venue, the qazi will not solemnise the nikaah. Dancing to DJ music will also be a strict ‘no-no’ at these villages. Such practices only add to the expenses to be borne by the bride’s family,” Karimi said.
 
 The three-hour-long panchayat also focused on education. The ulemas have asked people to educate their children, even if that means skipping a meal daily. The panchayat wants children of the community to have modern education, but it is not in favour of co-education.
