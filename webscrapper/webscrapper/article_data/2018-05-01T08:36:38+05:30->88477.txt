COIMBATORE: Freebies distributed by political parties as part of their election promises did come in handy for C   who lives in a thatched hut at Nagaroothu, a hilly tribal hamlet in Coimbatore district – the gadgets remained inside the boxes, but these were neatly stacked and used as a makeshift table on which was kept a lantern, some vessels and clothes.

 
 “How will we use the television set and mixer grinder without electricity,” asked V S   of the Tamil Nadu Tribal People’s Association.
 
 Nearly 4,000 households in 20 tribal settlements across the district do not appear to be in the scheme of things when it the Union government proclaimed on Sunday that every inhabited village in the country is now electrified.
 
 Even after 70 years of Independence, the hilly hamlets in Aliyar — Sinnarpathi, Navamalai, Keelpoonachi and  , and in Veetaikaranpudhur — Nagaroothu, Erumparai, Poomathi and Sarkarpathy — remain plunged in darkness. All these are in the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve forest.
 
 Ironically, most of the hamlets are a just a few kilometres away from power houses — Sarkarpathy, Navamalai, Kadamparai house and   — and the electric lines pass through the settlements, said Paramasivam. “When the official quarters in the tiger reserve forest can get power supply, why can’t the hamlets get electricity,” he asked. The state government set up solar panels in the settlements, but these stopped functioning in a couple of months, said a school teacher from Aliyar.
