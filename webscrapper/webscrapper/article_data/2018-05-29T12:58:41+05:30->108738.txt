PATNA: The son and brother of joint secretary rank officer   were arrested from their residence at   under the   police station area in the city on Monday. 

 
 
 Gardanibagh SHO CP Yadav said   (25) and his uncle Arun Singh (35) were arrested for firing five rounds in the air and thrashing a contractor engaged in the construction of public drainage system. He said a regular rifle, an air gun, 25 live cartridges of .315 bore, 20 live cartridges of double barrel gun and two empty cartridges of .12 bore used in firing were seized. 
 
 Uday is posted as chief general manager (procurement) at State Food Corporation (SFC) in Patna. His residence (111-C) is on road number 9 in Sector-C of Police Colony.
 
 “Drainage construction work is going on in the area. Contractor   is engaged in the construction on behalf of a multinational firm. He was thrashed and abused by Markandeya and Arun at around 11am,” the SHO said and added that an FIR was lodged against the duo on a written complaint by Yuvraj.
 
 Quoting Yuvraj’s statement, Yadav said they were pressurising the contractor to construct a pathway up to their residence from the road. He said Yuvraj expressed his inability to do so as the concrete meant for drainage construction could not be used for some other work.
 
 “It was then that the duo thrashed him and Markandeya opened five rounds of fire in the air from a double barrel gun to terrorize everyone around,” he said. “The double barrel gun was not found,” he added.
 
 When contacted, Uday told TOI over the phone that he was only aware about the contractor’s dispute with his son and brother. “I will not be able to comment on what happened on the spot,” he added.
