In a tug of war to win the hearts of the viewers, two popular Bengali television channels have aired their award shows in the last two weekends. Both the award functions were shot months ago.

 Keeping the rivalry alive, they are also launching mega serials almost back to back. One of the general entertainment channels has just launched two serials, ‘Jibon Jyoti’ and ‘Phagun Bou’. The other one is also about to launch two brand new shows, ‘Krishnakali’ and ‘Jay Baba Loknath’.
 
 One of the award shows that aired last week was hosted by film actors Srabnanti Chatterjee , Subhashree Ganguly and Kanchan Mullick. If one channel had the film stars as anchors, the other show was hosted by one of the actors of its mega serial.
 
 One of the leading channels airs mega serials ‘Kusum Dola’, ‘Ke Apon Ke Por’ and the other telecasts ‘Rani Rashmani ’, ‘Saat Bhai Champa’. With the help of these serials, the channels are at loggerheads vying for the numero uno spot on TRP charts too.
 
 Both the channels paid tribute to veteran actress Rita Koiral, whom the industry has recently lost. In the quest of adding x-factor, one of these award shows which was aired yesterday, had disco night with Bollywood music director   while the other one had   on stage. But incidentally both of these channels had Tollywood stars   and Koel Mallick as guests at their award ceremony.
 
 The TRPs of this week will only say which award function won the hearts of the audience.
