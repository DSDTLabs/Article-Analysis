LUCKNOW: Corporators complained about many private   not paying water and   to Jal Sansthan, which causes revenue loss.

 Shivpal Sawaria, a corporator from Rajajipuram, pointed out that CMS Rajajipuram’s new campus has encroached on the modern garbage dumping ground and using it as store and library. The vehicles of its students too are parked on the road, he said, adding that they have also encroached a green belt.
 
 
 CMS spokesperson, however, clarified that the library was opened by former mayor   and is open for public use. He said, “The green belt was full of wild grass before we beautified it after taking LMC’s permission. The green area is for public use. For the parking, we pay Rs 28 lakh tax to LMC every year.”
 
 
 Mayor, however, ordered a probe into non-payment of water and sewer taxes and encroachment of   by schools.
