LUCKNOW: Climbing up the iron gate outside the new   at   has become a habit for patients and attendants. Recent order issued by   to lock the gate after 12 noon is not being taken seriously as attendants and   it all to cut down the extra walk. 

 The vice chancellor ordered closure of the gate to avoid the path from being used as a detour by random two-wheeler riders to avoid the traffic jam outside but now patients and their attendants are facing difficulty with the new rule.
 
 “When we came to the OPD, the gate was open and now as we return the gates are shut. My grandfather is too old and weak and can’t walk that much and I can’t leave him alone here and go get transport,” said Kamlesh, a resident of Mohanlalaganj. Many, who are able-bodied, have been scaling the gates to reach private medicine shops right outside the OPD. 
 
 Guards posted at the gate have been informing people about the rule but have failed to stop them from climbing up the closed gate. “The result could be risky and lead to accidents so guards will have to be stricter,” said  , chief medical superintendent (CMS), KGMU. He added that time duration for shutting the gates might soon be relaxed, since some complaints have been received against it.
