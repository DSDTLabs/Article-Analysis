MUMBAI: The   on Thursday informed the Bombay high court that it has not yet framed any policy for banning the sale of meat on certain days celebrated as religious festivals.

 The court adjourned the matter for two weeks after the parties sought time to study the judgment. The court had on Wednesday asked if any such policy was framed as directed by it after discussions with all parties and communities. The court is hearing a petition challenging the ban on slaughter and sale of meat on four days in Mumbai for   that is observed by the Jain community.

 On Wednesday, the court had asked the state if a policy was framed on the issue and also reiterated its earlier direction to “find a solution“.
