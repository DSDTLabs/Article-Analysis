AHMEDABAD: The income tax (I-T) department has been taking help of Gujarat-based agriculture universities to assess whether the exorbitant income from farming shown by many people in the state, apparently to get tax benefits under farm income, are realistic or not.

 The department has already approached a Junagadh-based agriculture university to know if the farm income shown by over 1,500 persons matched with real figures of crop production and profit. 
 
 The exercise was conducted in March and October last year after many industrialists mentioned bumper crop and huge income from agriculture. Sources said that I-T sleuths had found many suspicious income tax entries from Saurashtra and   region which include Surat and Valsad districts.
 
 Experts at the agriculture varsity said that the taxmen were shocked to find farm income of some businessmen alarmingly high as they had shown huge profit from their agricultural sources. The major portion of their income was from agriculture. The income tax department wrote to scientists at  , requesting them to give details of the various crops and its productivity and cost-benefit ratio, which every agriculture university keeps. 
 
 “We were told to provide details of certain crops and how much profit one can earn from them. “One of the officers jokingly said that if farming is so productive, as some of the industrialists have sown, no farmers would have committed suicide in the country,” said a university official.
 
 “Last year, we approached some universities after getting intimation from our central office that many people have been showing exorbitant income from farming just to evade tax. Then, we decided to approach the agriculture universities to know the facts,” said officials. The officials added that the   with the I-T department and data of agriculture produce will be scrutinized to nab the defaulters.
