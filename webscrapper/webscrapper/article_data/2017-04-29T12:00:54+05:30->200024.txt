LUCKNOW: With the forthcoming urban local bodies polls and 2019   elections in mind,  's central leadership would meet its defeated soldiers - the candidates who lost the assembly elections- on Saturday to review the causes of its most humiliating loss and also chalk out the future course of action. 

 This is the third such meeting after UP elections. The high command has already held meetings of district and city Congress chiefs and then of the seven MLAs. 
 
 The party, which fought in coalition with the SP, had fielded 105 candidates out of which only seven could win. It finished at number two in 48 constituencies.
 
 All the 98 losing candidates would be addressed by the party's national general secretary and state in charge Ghulam Nabi Azad and UPCC chief  . "It's not sure yet, but most likely vice-president of the party  , may also drop in,"said a senior functionary of the party.
 
 Majority of district-level functionaries and candidates who lost the elections are likely to express their reservations against the SP-Congress tie-up, especially the manner in which it was forged. "We were not opposed to the alliance, it should have been cemented much before the polls," says a Congress leader.
 
 Contrary to this mood, the winners had spoke in favour of the alliance. Speaking to TOI, Aaradhana Mishra, the MLA from  , she did not think the alliance was against the interests of the party.
 
 However, Bhoodhar Narain Mishra, a senior leader from Kanpur, said that the alliance was solely responsible for the party's debacle. " I had written to the party president Sonia Gandhi soon after the 2014 LS polls when the party won just two seats. I had warned that unless the party stood on its own, revival was most unlikely. When we had a successful programme of '27 saal, UP behal', there was no need for an alliance," he said. After the meeting, the party high command will focus on the organization elections which are to be started from May.
