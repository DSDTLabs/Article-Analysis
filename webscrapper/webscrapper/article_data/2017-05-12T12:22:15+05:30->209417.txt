CHANDIGARH: Power minister Rana Gurjit Singh’s alleged conflict of interest of having shares in a company which sells 20 MW electricity to the state-owned   State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has come under the Punjab and Haryana high court lens. A PIL filed by advocate   seeking directions to remove the minister from the power department came up for hearing before a division bench comprising Justices S S Saron and   on Thursday.

 As Punjab advocate general ( ) Atul Nanda sought some time to address the issue, the court did not issue a formal notice on the petition.
 
 The petitioner submitted that Rana Gurjit and his wife Rana Rajbans Kaur hold majority shares in Rana Sugars Limited, which had signed an agreement with PSPCL to on December 4, 2012, to supply 20MW electricity generated by it. He further argued that in the agreement, which would continue till December 4, 2027, there were some provisions as per which PSPCL had to make advance payments to the company after some discount. 
 
 The court was informed that the power minister had full control over PSPCL. It was submitted that few days back, Rana Gurjit had made a public statement of reviewing agreements with private power generating companies in the state. The petitioner made the submission that a situation of conflict of interest has arisen and thus minister’s portfolio should be changed. Else he should be directed to dispose off all shares held by him and his spouse in Rana Sugars Limited.
 
 Though the advocate general tried to submit that there was no conflict of interest as PSPCL was under the Electricity Regulatory Authority, the petitioner countered stating that as the power minister was going to review its agreements with private power suppliers, his own company was among those firms. The case would now come up for arguments on July 23.
