LUCKNOW: BSP chief   on Monday expelled her MLA and party candidate from   in Ghaziabad, Amarpal Sharma, barely four days before he was to file his nomination papers.

 Sharma was expelled from the party on charges of being `inactive' in the constituency and remaining busy with his personal work. BSP district president in Ghaziabad,  , said that the people in the constituency were extremely annoyed with Sharma's candidature. ``Therefore the party has not only cancelled Sharma's candidature but has also expelled him,'' he said.
 
 Bharti said that instead of conducting cadre camps and getting engaged with the people, Sharma was only concerned about his private works. Sharma, however, trashed the allegation saying that he was a victim of a conspiracy. ``The party workers have fed wrong information about me to the party high command. I will speak to the party leadership,'' said Sharma, while speaking to TOI. He also denied of being in touch with any other party. He said that he has been conducting meetings and other party activities in his constituency.
 
 A first time MLA, Sharma had contested the 2007 assembly election as an independent. He, however, joined the BSP the same year when Mayawati came to power with absolute majority. In 2012, he got a party ticket and won the seat. He was a party candidate from the same constituency and was to file his nomination papers on January 20.
