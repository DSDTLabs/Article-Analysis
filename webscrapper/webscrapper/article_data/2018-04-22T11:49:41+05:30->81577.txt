VIJAYAWADA: Despite statements of union finance minister   claiming there is adequate   in city ATMs, Vijayawadites are welcomed with ‘no cash’ boards at the cash withdrawing centres.

 Even after 17 months of note ban, the ghost of demonetisation is haunting citizens. While the everyday cash   has left citizens struggling, not enough legal tender in the weekends has left buyers and sellers furious. Majority of the ATM centres in the city are running out of cash on Sundays and other holidays. Huge queue lines were noticed at a few ATMs dispensing cash.
 
 “I almost searched 80 ATMs in the city and all of them welcomed me with ‘no cash’ boards. Banks are insisting us to withdraw money from ATMs,” says N.   a private employee.
 
 A few cash recyclers are the only hope for us which are at least dispensing Rs 2,000 in smaller denominations, he added. Cashless transactions are adding additional burdens on denizens. “Service charges has become a big burden on us as hotels and eateries are charging 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent additional charge on transaction. The government which is failing to provide adequate cash in ATM centres should at least consider problems faced by the common man and remove service charges on PoS transactions,” says K. Anitha a techie.
 
 Meanwhile, peoples organiaations in the city are gearing up to agitate against the union government as the common man is struggling because of the government’s ‘punt’.
