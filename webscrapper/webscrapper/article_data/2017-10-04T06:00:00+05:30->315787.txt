Despite the incessant rains that battered Hyderabad,   was packed to capacity with over 1,500 Hyderabadis turning up to engage in meaningful and intellectual session with some of the finest thinkers of the country at   Samvaad. Among the speakers who dwelled upon issues of public interest were Supreme Court Justice  , activist  , Founder of Takshashila Institution Nitin Pai, prof Sucheta Mahajan from   University, stand-up comedian  , and Former Minister of Finance Yashwant Sinha. 

 While Sinha focussed on the torments of Kashmiris, and spoke of how they’ve suffered for generations and have lived under the shadows of security forces, feeling alienated, Nikhil Dey spoke about ‘transparency to accountability in India’s democratic state’ and pointed out that of 80 lakh people who file RTI applications every year more than 60 people have lost their lives.
 The talks of the evening made the participants sit up, ponder, and react. So much so, long after the session came to an end, they were seen engaged in impassioned discussions.
