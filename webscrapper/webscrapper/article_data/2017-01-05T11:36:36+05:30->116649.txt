INDORE: The plight of commuters travelling on the   over   at   would come to an end in couple of years since civic body started work of widening the bridge on Wednesday. The civic body would develop a six lane bridge in place of the old one. The project will cost around Rs 8 crore. 

 Officials said that width of the new bridge will be 80 metres and its height will be increased by two inches. "We have decided to increase the height of the bridge as in past it had submerged in swollen Khan river posing threat to commuters," said  , head of public works department, Indore municipal corporation (IMC). Residents of the area have been demanding a new bridge for a long time. They had complained that the bridge was in poor condition since it had become old. Also, it failed to handle the pressure of vehicles that has increased by many times in last few years. Frequent traffic jams also occur in the area due to this. 
 
 Mayor  , who laid the foundation stone of the new bridge on Wednesday, said that she will monitor its construction work on regular basis and assured that the new bridge will come as a big relief for the locals. Though the new bridge will ease traffic movement, its construction work in the area might lead to problems for commuters in coming days.
 
 To put an end to traffic woes, the IDA has also planned to come up with six new flyovers and underpasses in the most congested areas of the city.
