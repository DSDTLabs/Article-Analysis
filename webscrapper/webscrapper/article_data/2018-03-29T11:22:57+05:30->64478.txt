KARACHI: Tainted Pakistan pacer   suffered humiliation at the   where he was refused entry by immigration officials for not having complete documents.

 The pacer, who served a five-year ban for spot-fixing between 2010 and 2015, required additional clearance to enter the emirates as in 2008 he had been detained and sent to jail after a small quantity of opium was found in his pocket.
 
 Asif said he had been issued a visa for the visit to   where he was invited to play in a T20 tournament in  .
 
 "But I didn't have the one particular letter and the organisers have now said they will arrange it after which I might still go and play in the tournament," he added.
 
 Asif, besides the spot-fixing ban and the opium possession case, has also been banned once for failing a dope test and once got into a brawl with   before the 2007 World T20.
