THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   has appointed   as the commandant of the all-woman police battalion, the first-of-its-kind force created in the state. 

 Nishanthini, who was serving as the SP (special cell), vigilance and  , Thiruvananthapuram, will take over as the first commandant of the battalion that will be based in the capital. A 2008-batch officer, she had served as AIG (police headquarters), DCP (Kochi), SP (Thrissur rural) and city police commissioner, Thrissur. 
 
 The government had issued orders to constitute an all-woman police battalion in the state as per which those women in the public service commission's rank list will be inducted into the battalion. At present, the total strength of women police officials in the state police force is only 6.4% and the government planning to increase it to 15%.
 
 As part of creating the new battalion, the government had sanctioned 451 posts, including that of a battalion commandant, 20 women police havildars and 380 women police constables. Though originally there was a move to base the battalion to Kannur, it was later decided that it should be based in the capital itself. 
 
 However, the government is yet to come up with a clear cut role for the battalion. Even though the Kerala Police Act, the Pocso Act and the criminal procedure code underlines the importance of role of women in investigation, battalions have no such role except to augment the local police in case of emergency situations like riots. The government is also yet to create additional infrastructure for the battalion.
