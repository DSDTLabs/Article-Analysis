CHENNAI: As expression of dissent cannot be a valid ground to disqualify a legislator, it will be legally tough to defend the suspension of MLAs loyal to TTV Dhinakaran, jurists say. Issuance of whip, its defiance and actual casting of vote or abstention are the ingredients necessary for action under the Constitution and anti-defection laws. 

 “The present decision of the speaker is subject to judicial review. As per the anti-defection law, an MLA can be disqualified if there is a violation of whip or the member voluntarily gives up the membership. In this case, both the situations have not happened,” said Subhash Kashyap, aConstitution expert. 
 
 But the MLAs have expressed no-confidence with the CM and would that tantamount to giving up their membership? “This is the surmise of the speaker. We will have to see whether the decision stands judicial scrutiny,” Kashyap said. “If the court does not grant stay, the governor may call for a floor test immediately. In that case, DMK cannot defeat the confidence motion,” Justice K Chandru, former judge of the Madras HC, said. 
 
 “The immediate objective of the speaker’s decision looks more like dragging the rebels into litigation than scoring a final win,” said senior advocate S Prabakaran. 
 
 “The speaker had no other option but to act against the rebel MLAs. His only option was Schedule X,” said former solicitor-general for India Mohan Parasaran. “The disqualification of 18 legislators is a fit case to be challenged in the court,” he said. 
 
 The constitutional status of nine AIADMK legislators, including deputy CM O  , too is under the scanner, as Article 102(2)(b) says an act of defiance of whip should be condoned by the speaker within 15 days. Though these nine voted against Edappadi K Palaniswami’s confidence motion on February 17 this year, their act is yet to be formally condoned. Ahead of that trust vote, the OPS faction had appointed another rebel MLA Semmalai as whip. His status too remains unknown now.
