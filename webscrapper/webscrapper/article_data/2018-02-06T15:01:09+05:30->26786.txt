While 25 of them have tested positive for HIV and are undergoing treatment in Kanpur, pathology reports of the remaining 13 are awaited.

 "The quack used the syringe on 38 people of whom 25 have contracted the virus in some villages of Bangarmau tehsil in Unnao. While pathology reports of the remaining people is awaited, a team of doctors has been formed to look into case.

 Dr   said blood samples of 566 people, including 38 treated by the quack, were taken in January. "While 25 of the 38 tested positive for HIV, reports of the remaining 13 are awaited. The affected persons also include a father-son and a mother-son duo," he said."It's shocking how one person can cause such damage to society. A quack, who has been identified as Rajendra Yadav of Shiv Baksh Kheda of Unnao, used an infected syringe and needle on so many unsuspecting people," the CMO said, adding that an FIR was lodged against the quack on January 31 at Bangarmau Kotwali.
 
  
  
 
 Health officials said all the 25 affected people have been put on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) at the ART centre of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM)   in Kanpur.
 
 "Threat from quacks has always been overlooked and needs to be urgently addressed. The number of people contracting diseases due to infected syringes has shown an increase," said a senior medical college official.
