DHARAMSHALA: Before reaching Delhi after his countrywide tour, the anti-corruption crusader and social activist   would visit   to exhort the public of this hill state to join his agitation against the Centre beginning from March 23. He would be holding public meetings at various places in the state this month and in the first week of March.

 Farmer’s suicide and Lokpal bill are the issues for which Anna said he was going to sit on agitation.
 
 “I have chosen March 23 for agitation as it is Shaheed Diwas (Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev were hanged on this day). After touring other parts of the country, the last leg would be Himachal,” Anna told TOI from Delhi on Wednesday.
 
 He said he had been touring the country for over last two months. “I don’t know about my bank accounts, don’t know where I have kept my passbook too. But people send me tickets. It has been going on from last two months, since I decided to raise these issues” he added.
 
 Shimla and   are two places in Himachal where Anna would be holding public meetings. “I’m coming to Nahan this month and then Shimla. But dates will be decided after February 19,” he said.
 
 “I am sitting on agitation with the demand that minimum support price should be decided on the basis of expenditures of farmers and that a farmer, who has no other source of income and is 60 years old should get a monthly   of at least Rs 5,000,” he said.
 
 Kisan Pension Bill has been pending in the Lok sabha for years now, he added.
