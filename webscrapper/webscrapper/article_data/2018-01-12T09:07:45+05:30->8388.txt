BENGALURU: Facing barbs for likening BJP-RSS activists to terrorists, chief minister   on Thursday got into damage-control mode, stating: “I only said there were some   extremists in the   and RSS, did not call them terrorists.”

 Siddaramaiah’s volte-face comes in the backdrop of fears that such loose comments would only help the BJP consolidate Hindu votes in the run-up to the assembly polls. In fact, Siddaramaiah had drawn flak from BJP leaders after reportedly telling reporters in Chamarajanagar district on Wednesday that “there are terrorists in the BJP, RSS and Bajrang Dal”.
 
 The BJP hit back, stating it would court arrest by launching a jail bharo programme and the party’s supporters unleashed a social media campaign with the hashtag #ArrestMeSiddaramaiah.
 
 Siddaramaiah told reporters in  : “I had said they are Hindu extremists. I am also a Hindu. But the difference between me and them is that I am a Hindu with humanity.” Sources in the   said the party high command had advised him to stick to the development agenda instead of getting trapped in the communal game played by the BJP.
 
 However, the BJP was not enthused and raised the throttle on the issue. Chikkamagaluru-Udupi MP Shobha Karandlaje said: “According to the CM, we are terrorists and very dangerous people. We need to be put in the jail and hence, this jail bharo programme.”
 
 Dharwad MP   termed Siddamaraiah an “anti-national” for dubbing BJP-RSS workers terrorists. “The people of the country have given their mandate to the BJP and the party is ruling the country. But Siddaramaiah is calling a majority of Indians who voted for the BJP as terrorists. This is disgusting,” he said.
 
 The party’s social media wing used the CM’s comment to whip up Hindu sentiments. One tweet read: “Siddaramaiah, Will you arrest all BJP and RSS karyakarthas? Do you even have place to arrest more than a million people? If so, then start with me. #ArrestMeSiddaramaiah.”
