MUMBAI: A day after revenue   Chandrakant Patil said that 37 lakh farmers had benefited from the state’s loan   scheme,   minister Subhash Deshmukh told the assembly on Wednesday that the waiver had been credited into the accounts of 46.5 lakh farmers.

 The figure of 46.5 lakh is in reality the number of accounts on the green list for which the   waiver has been sanctioned after checking eligibility criteria for the waiver. 
 
 The   was quick to jump on this momentary slip. 
 
 “There is so much confusion and contradiction over the loan waiver figures. We have been telling the government to put the entire list online on the government portal and bring out a white paper,” said leader of Opposition in the state assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil.
 
 Deshmukh told the assembly that till now an amount of Rs 13,782 crore had been disbursed into the accounts of farmers. 
 
 Defending the delay, Deshmukh said that in the 2008 loan waiver in the Congress-NCP regime, it had taken 18-19 months for the money to be credited. “At that time, an amount of Rs 155 crore went into the wrong hands. Of this, only Rs 105 crore has been recovered. We wanted to avoid this, which is why we took the system online and conducted multiple checks,” Deshmukh said.
 
 He added that the state had extended the date for accepting online applications for the loan waiver till the end of March. “We will accept applications from March 1 to 31st and ensure that all eligible farmers receive he waiver,” Deshmukh said. 
 
 He also said that cooperative banks should consider waiving the interest of loan beneficiaries.
