Mahakavi Kumaran Asan’s works are known for its deep moral and spiritual context. Recently, one of his poems,  , was presented as a drama by the actors of   in the city.

 Titled Adiyathambratti, the story dealt with the Mappila riots that shook the Malabar region in the early 20th century. Through the story of Savithri, the heiress to one of the Namboothiri Illams, and Chathan, a person belonging to low caste, the drama showcased that love can transcend all boundaries.
 
 In the play, after fighting all odds to retain her chastity, Savithri is left with no choice but to seek refuge in a Pulaya’s house, thereby breaking all the barriers of caste and creed. The characters of Savithri and Chathan were played by Geetha Rajan and Rejesh Thaliyil. The performances were so realistic that the audience could empathise with the protagonists, caught in the web of caste disparities.
 
 Ask scriptwriter   Sreeshta as to why he took up Duravastha for the theatre adaptation, and he says, “Though the work showcases the political background of 19th and the early 20th century Kerala, it is relevant even today. It mocks the intolerant thoughts that have seeped into the minds of people in the contemporary society, and also throws light into the recurring instances of religious intolerance.”
 
 Rejesh Thaliyil credits director   and the scriptwriter for helping him get into the skin of the character, Chathan. He says, “Playing the role was a challenge since I had to make a lot of changes in terms of body language and thought processes. My slang also underwent a sea change for the role.”
 
 Geetha attributes all credits to her mentor and veteran theatre director N N Pillai, for being able to essay the role of Savithri with conviction. She says, “He used to tell me not introduce artificiality while acting and I just adhered to it. I am happy that with this attempt, we could tell people how important it is to break the shackles of religion.”
