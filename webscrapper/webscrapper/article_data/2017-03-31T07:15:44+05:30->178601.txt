PIMPRI CHINCHWAD:   of the   (PCMC) have helped the civic body   arrears worth Rs 3 crore in just eight days.

 The squads initiated action against 48 properties within the PCMC limits till Wednesday. “The property tax department of PCMC had sent notices to around 65,000 property owners with arrears over Rs 10,000 each. In the notice, the owners were directed to clear their dues to avoid sealing of their properties. On March 22, the property seizure drive was initiated,” joint municipal commissioner   told TOI.
 
 Currently, the department is concentrating on defaulters with maximum dues in the past three years. “A list of such defaulters is prepared every day and handed over to the divisional offices for further action,” Gawde said, adding that each squad comprises two security guards, one person to record video, an administrative officer, an office superintendent among others.
 
 “Some people tend to stop the squad from sealing their properties. However, they relent after seeing that a video recording of the incident is being made. Most of the times, the defaulters make part payment or give us post-dated cheques. In cases where a defaulter fails to make any payment, we seal his/her property” said Gawde. 
 
 He said 16 divisional offices of the department and six zonal offices of the civic body will be kept open from 9am to 6pm on March 31 to allow people to clear their arrears. “Those who fail to pay their annual tax for 2016-17 by March 31 will have to pay a penalty of 2% per month on the amount,” Gawde said.
 
 The department collected Rs 379.56 crore in tax till Wednesday. The annual target for property tax collection for 2016-17 is Rs 400 crore.
