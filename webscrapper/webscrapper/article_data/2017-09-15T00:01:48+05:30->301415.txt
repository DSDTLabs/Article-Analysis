MUMBAI: Two  , who climbed atop   poles and hit commuters travelling in passing trains to steal valuables, were nabbed by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Wednesday. Two of their associates managed to flee.   robberies have cost commuters their lives in a few instances.

 “We were receiving repeated complaints of pole robberies in the Kurla-Sion and Chunabhatti-Kurla belt. We started posting cops in plain clothes in passing trains to keep a watch in these routes. Around 7.25pm on Wednesday, our personnel observed some movement on the tracks near pole no. 13/8 kms. Ground staff was alerted and two 17-year-old boys were taken into custody,” said Suresh Atri, senior inspector, Kurla RPF.
 
 The boys confessed to their involvement in at least two cases that occurred earlier this week. They have been sent to the Dongri observartion room.
 
 “The two others, who are at large, have been identified as Adil Shaikh (19), and Riyaz (22). Both have a past crime record. All four are residents of Behrampada in Bandra. The case has been transferred to the Wadala GRP outpost,” Atri said.
