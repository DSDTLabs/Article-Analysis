After all, the Saturday afternoon baroque   concert was the first such event to be held in the   in its 250 years of existence. And in attendance were more than 500 music and history lovers of the city, who enjoyed the soothing mix of piano, violin and cello floating among the centuries-old headstones.
 
 The five musicians, led by violinist Prosanto Chunder Dutt, played several baroque compositions, including those of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Friedric Handel. But that couldn’t keep the audience members seated for long. Most of them were soon moving around the six-acre cemetery, clicking selfies and reading the inscriptions on the old headstones, with the music setting the mood. Musician and Chandrabindoo frontman Upal Sengupta was one of them. “I’m not classical musician, but I came here to be a part of this wonderful initiative. I can’t imagine a better ambiance for a western classical music concert,” he said.
 
  
 It was an initiative of the  , which runs seven cemeteries in Kolkata. Ranajoy Bose, the managing member of the board, rued that despite being a treasure trove of heritage, the cemetery hasn’t been able to establish itself as a tourist destination. Moreover, it hasn’t been maintained properly due to a shortage of funds. “So, we thought it apt to celebrate its 250th anniversary with something that would connect to the city’s people and create awareness about it,” he added.
