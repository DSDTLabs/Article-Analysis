Surat: An airport group has demanded inquiry by Central Bureau of Intelligence (CBI) and Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) into illegal construction of 18 high-rise buildings that obstruct the flight path of runway at Surat airport.  Surat Airport Action Committee (SAAC) has written to CBI and CVC demanding inquiry against central and state government authorities for irregularities and turning a blind eye on the illegal construction and violating the terms and conditions of no-objection certificate (NoCs) issued by Airports Authorities of India.  In the letters, SAAC has pointed that the RTI data given by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) and Airports Authority of India (AAI) revealed that 18 residential buildings towards Vesu side of the runway at Surat airport are obstructing the landing of aircraft. The builders and architects provided proper data to all the authorities, including AAI for obtaining NOCs, but the coordinates at the time of obtaining NOCs were different when the original sites were surveyed in 2017.  The NOCs of the 18 projects were issued between 2007 to 2013 period. The AAI did area inspection in 2007 and the next inspection was done in 2017. However, the illegal construction of the buildings were taken up in the gap of 10 years when no survey was done.  As per the terms and conditions of the NOC, if the builders, developer or architect provides wrong information, the NOC stands cancelled and that the structures need to be demolished.  “The AAI, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Civil Aviation Ministry are keeping mum on the building obstacles to airport in Surat. The obstruction of 12.30 meters is actually hampering the development of the airport. Recently, the DGCA has displaced 615 metre of runway due to building obstruction and we are left with only 2,290 metre runway,” SAAC president Sanjay Ezhawa said.
