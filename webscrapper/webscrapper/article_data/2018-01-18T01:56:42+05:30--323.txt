NEW DELHI: Delhi   on Wednesday expressed concern over   of   apparel and gear, pointing out that the issue has implications on ‘state security and public safety.’

 Pulling up the   for not taking the issue seriously, HC asked the   to take steps to curb the sale and manufacture of such items.
 
 The court’s observations came in the backdrop of recent terror strikes, including the one at the Pathankot Airforce base in January 2016 by terrorists dressed in Indian Army fatigues, leading to the death of seven security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a civilian.
 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and C Hari Shankar directed the Delhi government to take immediate steps to curb private manufacturing, stocking and sale of military   and gear used by the armed forces.
 
 It further asked the defence ministry to take immediate action to comply with several government communications in this regard, dating back to 1986-99.
 
 The high court also directed the authorities to file a report in eight weeks, noting that despite there being a penal provision to punish those wearing or carrying tokens used by soldiers, not a single action has been taken.
 
 The bench passed the order while deciding the plea of an NGO, which had raised the issue citing terror attacks and submitted that private sale of military apparel and gear was a cause for concern.
 
 Advocate K R Chitra, appearing for NGO Fight for Human Rights, told HC that after the Pathankot incident, the petition was filed and a subsequent representation was made before the competent authority, but no action was taken.
