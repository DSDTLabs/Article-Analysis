SURAT: At least 200 parents of students of   held a protest against the recent stand taken by school authorities with regard to the fee issue here on Saturday. The group of parents also shouted slogans against state education minister  . 

 The parents claimed that results of students, who did not pay their fees, have been withheld by the school authorities. They alleged that school authorities were refusing to promote the students and not ready to even give them school leaving certificates. 
 
 “Parents of around 2,000 students did not pay fees waiting for a positive conclusion to the fee regulation issue. The school authorities have refused to give results of the students until they pay the fees and also refused to promote them to higher standards,” a protesting parent   said.
 
 “Earlier, the parents were given hope by the state government, but now we have been put in a fix by the education minister. Angry parents have gathered to express their anger against the school and also against the minister,” another parent said.
 
 “The school has shown results to students, but we are not giving marksheet or school leaving certificate to them since they are yet to pay the fees. They are supposed to pay the fees as per the rules,” school administrator   said. 
 
 A number of parents made calls to the district education officer U N Rathod, but he did not answer them. Many even went to meet Rathod at his office, but he was not present. Rathod had refused to intervene in the issue in the past saying only   (FRC) appointed by the state government can address it.
