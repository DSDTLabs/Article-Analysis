MUMBAI: The Bombay   dismissed an   filed by a man whose plea for divorce on the grounds of   was rejected by a family court in the city in February 2008. The high court bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai said it had kept the appeal pending since February “in the hope that the parties will see reason and come out with an amicable solution”.

 With no amicable settlement between the two, the bench on July 7 dismissed the husband’s plea after finding inadequate evidence of the alleged cruelty by the wife in the 23-year-old marriage. The wife, an airline employee, had married him following his divorce from an earlier wife. In 2000, six years after they tied the knot, the husband filed for divorce on the grounds of cruelty and an alleged disorder of his wife. He said it was such that he “cannot be reasonably expected to live with her”.
 
 The court after hearing both sides found that “even assuming there were acts of cruelty…they were consistently condoned by the husband”. The court relied on greeting cards sent by the husband to his wife in 1999 which “showed that everything was normal”.
 
 “What is pertinent to note is that even on October 8, 2000, during the pendency of the petition, the appellant forwarded a greeting card to the respondent,” the high court said. It observed: “It is true that the marriage between the parties seems to have irretrievably broken down. However, … unless one of the grounds for dissolution of marriage is established, the court is powerless to pass a decree of divorce.”
 
 The high court expressed its helplessness in passing a decree of divorce on the grounds of complete breakdown of marriage. Holding that both grounds alleged by the husband had not been established, even though the family court judgment “may not be satisfactory, the ultimate conclusion is correct”.
