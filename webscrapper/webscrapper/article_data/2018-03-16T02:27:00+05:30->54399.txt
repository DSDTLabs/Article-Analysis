Guntur: The death of three more patients because of acute   on Thursday took the toll to 13, sending the cityâ€™s civic administration in a tizzy. According to information, the patients were aged between 55-65 years, and were under treatment for diarrhoea for the past 10 days. According to GGH authorities, M Ganga Bhavani of Kothapet, Burraiah of DS Nagar, and Nukaraju of Pothuri Vari Thota died in the early hours following renal failure.

 All three were shifted from GGH to a private hospital last week for better treatment and were under close observation at the private super speciality hospital. With the patients not responding to treatment, they were again shifted to GGH late on Wednesday night. Sources said all the three were declared dead within hours after readmitting to GGH.
 
 Sources said the condition of 10 other patients, in GGH and private hospitals, is critical, and chances of their recovery are bleak. Doctors at GGH said they are providing the best possible care to diarrhoea victims. However, many could not cope with the fast-spreading acute diarrhoea. A senior medical officer said patients with diabetes are more vulnerable to kidney failure in such cases. 
 
 About 30-40 patients are still under treatment in GGH, while more than 400 are said to be admitted in private hospitals. Rising number of new cases from Two Town area have become a cause of concern for civic authorities, who, during the initial days of the outbreak had dismissed the charges of supplying contaminated drinking water.
 
 Locals in   had alleged that the civic department had ingored their complaints about drainage water contaminating drinking water supplies.
