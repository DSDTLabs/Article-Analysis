NEW DELHI: Accusing   of going back on its position on triple talaq, leader of   on Wednesday termed as invalid the opposition demand that the contentious bill be referred to a select committee. 

 Congress MP   had cited Rule 70 (sub-rule 2a) - which mentions the right of a member to move as an amendment that the bill be referred to a select committee - to justify the opposition’s case, but Jaitley countered it by saying that this rule was invalid as the bill had originated in the   and was later transmitted to the Rajya Sabha. 
 
 Jaitley also stated that since notice for setting up of a select panel was not given earlier, proper parliamentary procedure was not being followed. “Not only the names given for the proposed panel were proportionate to the strength of the parties represented in the   but the consent of these members was also not taken, ‘’ he said. 
 
 “Now, we are taken by surprise that we all assemble here after 3 PM, a motion is suddenly submitted to us. For the first time breaking all parliamentary convention and procedures, an invalid motion is moved,” Jaitley added. Citing reasons for the urgency of the bill to be passed to end the unlawful practice, Jaitley explained why the bill should not be referred to a select panel. 
 
 “The practice (of triple talaq) was declared unconstitutional on August 22. Two of the judges...held the practice to be unfair. They used their extraordinary power to suspend this practice for six months. Those six months expires on Feb 22.
