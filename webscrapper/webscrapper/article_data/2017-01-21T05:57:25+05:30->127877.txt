MUMBAI: The   is interested in contesting the   in alliance with the  , the party told mediapersons on Friday. But, at the same time, the party is also selecting candidates for all 227 electoral wards assuming that the   would fail. 

 A BJP party leader told TOI that a post-election   is possible after the BMC polls, similar to the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation election formula. “Sena wants a reason to go solo for the polls. Most probably, the KDMC poll formula would apply, where both parties fought separately and joined hands after the poll to enjoy power,” he added.
 
 “They (Sena) should be clear on the stand about alliance; they should not talk through the media. We are ready for an alliance for the sake of the people, but have also begun the selection process of 227 candidates,” said Education minister Vinod Tawde, who is on the BJP team in talks with Sena for sharing seats. “We had expected Sena to send senior leaders, such as Subhash Desai or Ramdas Kadam, for the talks, but they sent juniors of the rank of vibhag pramukh.” 
 
 After two meetings with the Sena, the BJP, late on Thursday, shortlisted 114 wards from where it would field its candidates. The Sena, on Friday, didn’t respond to the BJP’s list and said the supreme authority of both parties—Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis—should take the decision on alliance, and not the teams of leaders. 
 
 On Sena MLC Anil Parab’s allegation that the state BJP has 13 tainted ministers, Tawde said Fadnavis has already clarified that the claims were baseless. He also clarified that BJP had pointed out contractors’ corruption in the BMC and had not targeted the Sena.
