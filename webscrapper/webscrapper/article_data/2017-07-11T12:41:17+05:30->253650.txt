AMRITSAR: Unrest over Gorkhaland movement in hills of Darjeeling,  , which led to killing of three persons in police firing on Saturday has evoked sharp criticism from the tiny hill town of   in Himachal Pradesh, home town to 4 Gorkha Rifles.

 The local Gorkha population is throwing its weight behind the agitators and justifying the demand of a separate state for Gorkhas to protect their identity. Bakloh is a tiny hill village bordering Punjab's Pathankot district with over a settlement of 4,000-5,000 Gorkhas.
 
 Condemning the alleged police brutality on Gorkhas, president of  , Bakloh, Vijay Gurung told TOI on Sunday “opening fire on agitators is totally unacceptable and is gross violation of human rights“. He said the sabha had demanded immediate intervention of the central government to prevent the situation from turning to worse . “We stand firm like a rock behind our fellow Gorkha brethren in Darjeeling,“ he said.
 
 Vijay's deputy Krishan Thapa alleged that the West Bengal government was trying to brand Gorkhas as terrorists . “The fact is that Gorkhas in Darjeeling are demanding a separate state and not a separate country , yet the police unleashed a terror on them,“ he said.
 
 A prominent resident of Bakloh, Rajiv Gurung said, “We are still identified as Nepalese in India while our forefathers died here as Indian nationals and we want to be recognized as Indians and not Nepalese.“
