CHENNAI:   officials are likely to summon six ministers and an MP, whose names allegedly figure on the documents seized from Tamil Nadu health minister C Vijayabaskar’s residence on Friday as recipients of Rs 90 crore for bribing the voters in the rescinded R K Nagar byelection.

 “The entire Rs 90 crore, as per the records seized by us, was routed through six state ministers and a Rajya Sabha MP to the people down below in their party (  (Amma) faction) to distribute among R KNagar voters. We may have to summon all of them for questioning,” said an I-T official.
 
 Meanwhile, on Monday,  , actor Sarathkumar and former AIADMK MP C Rajendran appeared before income tax officials, responding to the summons served on them by the I-T investigation wing. Though summons was served on MGR Medical University vice-chancellor C S   also, she did not appear before the officials. 
 
 “All the three persons were questioned separately. Vijayabaskar and Rajendran were let off after five hours. Sarathkumar was grilled for almost eight hours. They were asked to explain about the source of money and the contents of the documents seized. Geethalakshmi will be served another summons to appear before us,” said the official.
 
 In a related development, I-T officials raided Akash Lodge in Flower Bazaar on Monday evening to quiz a few relatives of Vijayabaskar who were staying there.
 
 The health minister, who was issued summons earlier, reached the I-T office around 11.00 am on Monday and left around 3.50pm. 
 
 “I cooperated with the I-T officials. I have not been told to appear before them again,” said Vijayabaskar to media personnel outside the I-T office. But I-T officials said the minister did not give convincing replies. 
 
 “We will be calling him again after a few days as he did not come to the office with any preparation,” said another official.
