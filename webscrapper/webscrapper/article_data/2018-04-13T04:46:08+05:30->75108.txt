NEW DELHI: Soon after the   rape case was referred to  , several Union ministers on Thursday came to the defence of the   government in UP, saying the   Adityanath dispensation is committed to protecting women and ensuring that law takes its course. 

 
 “When we say ‘Beti Bachao’, we really mean that. We are here to safeguard the interests of our daughters and we are committed to their safety. As far as Unnao incident is concerned, justice will prevail,” culture minister Mahesh Sharma told reporters.
 
 Women and child development minister   said action should be taken in every such case against women. “This is distressing and justice will be done. The case has been given to CBI and law will take its course,” she said.
 
 Backing the Uttar Pradesh government, railway minister Piyush Goyal said the government is working day and night to maintain law and order in the state. “The state government will bring to book all the culprits in the state,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said in Saharanpur no accused would be spared in the alleged gang-rape case. “The UP government has handed the probe over to the CBI. No accused will be spared,” he was quoted by PTI as saying.
