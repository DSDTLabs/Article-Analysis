CHANDIGARH: Replicating the " " adopted by it during the Delhi assembly elections,   (AAP) has prepared a team of 15,000 volunteers equipped with spy cams to keep an eye on any illegal activity. 

 An AAP leader told TOI that the party would use 14,200 spy cams, keychain and button cameras on February 4 at polling booths in different parts of the state to ensure that rival parties do not indulge in any foul play.
 
 "A team of 15,000 volunteers has already been given training on how to use these devices and capture any suspicious activity on cameras. They will be spreading to various constituencies over the next two days. Most of the seizures reported by AAP in Delhi were through its spy teams," he said.
 
 The videos and audio clips sent by these volunteers will be gathered at a control room in Chandigarh and then these will be passed on to the   of Indian (ECI) for necessary action. The equipment, said a party leader, was being provided to the volunteers by the party. "Some of it AAP had already bought and some was hired. Buying votes by offering liquor and use of force and threat are often used by the established parties to get votes," he claimed.
 
 In Delhi, the party had bought 2,000 spy cams and deployed them at various places in slums and jhuggis to put an end to the age-old practice by other parties of buying votes through distribution of cash and liquor.
 
 The party has planned to keep a watch on susceptible areas and even prepared a detailed list of these areas and planning to keep a strict vigil on these areas. The EC too has circulated a WhatsApp number, on which people can send their complaints with proof. It has promised to take prompt action on it.
