CHENNAI: Omni-channel   tech company Goomo on Monday announced acquisition of WagonBee, a   vehicle rental marketplace.

 Varun Gupta, CEO of Goomo, said, “Multi-day hiring of cars or larger vehicles is often done through the phone by travel agents and corporates, who have to spend a lot of time getting price quotes from multiple suppliers, confirming cab availability, and ensuring timely pickup. The acquisition of WagonBee will help Goomo add road transportation services to its list of offerings and further drive the brand’s promise of delivering end-to-end travel solutions to customers. Over and above this, the acquisition further reiterates our constant endeavour to build our overall tech competencies and develop the best technology-driven travel platform in the country.”
 
 “The Indian car rental market is estimated to be around 15 to US$18 billion and is expected to grow at 17 to 20% year-on-year. However, only around 10% of this market is organised, and the rest is managed by several smaller operators. WagonBee and Goomo are a perfect synergistic match given the similarities in our understanding of this fragmented market. We share a common vision of how this space can be organised better via apt solutions for our partner vendors as well as customised offerings to meet the evolving customer needs,” said Navneet Misra, co-founder, WagonBee.
 
 In a similar move, Goomo had earlier acquired  , a holiday marketplace startup, to build its presence in the holiday packages space.
