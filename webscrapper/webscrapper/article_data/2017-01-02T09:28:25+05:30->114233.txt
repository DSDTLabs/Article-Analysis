Mammootty's next project, to be helmed by 7th Day director  , will reportedly have him playing a trainer of sorts. The megastar is set to the join the movie after he winds up the schedule of Ranjith's  .

 The rumours are that the actor would play a staff in an training school of teachers. The movie is touted to be a family entertainer, which also has Alencier Ley teaming up with   after Kasaba and Thoppil Joppan last year.
 
 Incidentally, Mammootty would also be playing a college   in his movie, which is directed by Ajai Vasudev. Its scriptwriter Udayakrishna had told us, "It's set in a campus and Mammootty will play a college lecturer. The movie will be an entertainer and we hope to use Mammukka's superstar image to the maximum, in terms of his mannerisms and style."
