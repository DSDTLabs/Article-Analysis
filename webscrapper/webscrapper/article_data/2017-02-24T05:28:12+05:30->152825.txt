 is the third   candidate consecutively elected president of the   Students’ Union, having defeated NSUI candidate Nikhil Yadav by a margin of 4,680 votes in September last year. He, along with DUSU and ABVP, were opposed to JNU student leader Umar Khalid being invited to speak at the seminar at   on Tuesday and to the street play competition at   on Thursday.

 “As members of DUSU and as responsible citizens, we will continue to oppose any event where people abuse our nation, call for the breaking up of our country and ask for the separation of Kashmir and Bastar from India,” said Tanwar. “DUSU has, and will always, stand with the students of Delhi University and that is why thousands of students have supported us for years now.”
 
 On being charged by many people, including journalists, of assaulting protestors, Tanwar said that he had actually tried only to calm passions. “And if someone found me assaulting people, he or she can file a police complaint against me,” he insisted. Tanwar added that “DUSU has no business to act as the official censure of the university, but we will not tolerate anything that goes against the nation”.
