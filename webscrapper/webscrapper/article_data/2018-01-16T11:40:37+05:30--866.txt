Nagpur: A constable from Ganeshpeth police station allegedly slapped  , assistant superintendent of the district court, on Sunday.

 The grade-II staffer of the civil court had filed a complaint at the Ganeshpeth police station for the humiliation but no action was initiated. 
 
 Apart from Tiwari, the cops also learnt to have misbehaved with women and others in the locality, including roughing up youngsters who had tried to pin down a man under the influence of alcohol. Local residents claimed that the cops should have been tested for alcohol.
 
 An irate mob from Ganeshpeth marched to the police station to stage a protest against the cops. The protesters agreed to withdraw only after there was assurance from senior PI   of Ganeshpeth police station to act against the erring cops.
 
 The cops from Ganeshpeth police station were summoned to a locality in the vicinity following a ruckus created by one Chandrakant Jagtap. Local residents claimed that a few constables started beating them after   pointed out at them for having thrashed him. Ashish Choubey, Rahul Tiwari, Chhotu Tiwari, Rajesh Dattadhaye and   were the ones who were at the receiving end. 
 
 Tiwari said he had nothing to do with the ruckus. He said he had stepped out of home to intervene as the cops were apparently acting beyond their legal capacity by slapping local youngsters. “I am still not able to understand why the cops slapped me. All I was trying to do was convince them to follow the procedure for taking action and not slap indiscriminately,” he said.
 
 Ramesh’s kin Advocate   said, “Police should at once take action against the misbehaving constables,” he said.
 
 Gangurde said the residents’ allegations are now being probed. “There was some commotion between the cops and local residents but nothing beyond,” he said.
