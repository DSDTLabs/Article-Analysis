  "The encounter took place in Andhra and Chhattisgarh borders while Greyhounds were conducting combing operations on specific information. We are yet to identify the Maoists killed in encounter. All of the ultras are state committee leaders and have huge reward on their heads," said an intelligence officer.
 
 Meanwhile, a member of the Revolutionary Writers Association Varavara Rao said what happened wasn't an encounter. 
 
 "The encounter is fake. Police caught them and tortured them and murdered them. A judicial probe has to be conducted." said Rao.
