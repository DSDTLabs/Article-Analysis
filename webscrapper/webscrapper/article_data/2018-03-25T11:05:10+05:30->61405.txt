KOLKATA: Olympians   and   will spearhead India’s recurve teams in the first two stages of the   in Shanghai next month and Antalya, Turkey, in May.

 
 Other than Das, the men’s team, which was picked following a selection trial recently, has all new faces.
 
 Das’ teammates include two archers from the Services —   and   — while Ajay is from BSF. They trio has only one previous international appearance behind them.
 
  “This is a new team with fresh blood,” Das said. “It’s good that new archers are coming up which augurs well for the sport in the country,” he added.
 
 Apart from Deepika, the women’s team has veteran Laishram Bombayla Devi of the Railways, Jharkhand’s Ankita Bhakat and Assam youngster Promila Daimary.
 
 With the Asian Games scheduled later this year, India will look to make a good start to the season by winning some medals in the World Cups this time — something they failed to achieve last year. The Indian recurve team had managed a lone silver medal at the Asian Championships last year.
 
 Das, who will start the season ranked No. 21 in the world, will look for his first individual podium at a world outdoor event.
 
 “Every day is a new day and every season is a new season. I hope this season will be better than ever,” Das, who recently had a stint at the Hyung-Tak Archery Training Centre in Chungbuk province, South Korea, said.
 
 “I’m working harder and smarter to make the jump. I identified my mistakes in the past few years and started fixing them,” he added.
 
 The Indian men’s compound team for the first WC two legs will comprise the experienced Rajat Chauhan, Abhishek Verma, Chinna Raju Srither and Sangampreet Singh Bisla, while Divya Dhayal, Muskan Kirar, Madhumita Kumari and Jyothi Surekha Vennam form the women’s squad.
