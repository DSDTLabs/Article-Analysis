MHOW: The   of over   on Gambhir river between   and   on   started on Friday. It is likely to be completed in a week. 

 As a part of Mhow-Simrol road construction project, a new bridge will be constructed in its place that will be 12 metre wide and 45 metre long. As per the estimate of PWD officials, it will be constructed within four months.
 
 The bridge was over 100-year-old and was built under British rule as this road was a major link for transportation of goods to Khandwa and Burhanpur. 
 
 Though a diversion road has been constructed for the smooth flow of traffic that passes through Mhow crematorium, commuters are still facing problems as it has no indicator or sign board to show the diversion.
 
 "At present there is no lighting arrangement alongside the diversion road but the panchayat will soon do it," Gujarkheda sarpanch   told TOI.
 
 For all the commuters passing through Mhow- Simrol road, the journey will become smooth as the railway over bridge has already been made and the 17 km road between Mhow and Simrol is under construction. This bridge was the last thing to be done on this road.
