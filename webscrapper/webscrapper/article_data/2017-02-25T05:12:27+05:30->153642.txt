VADODARA: Industries in the city will soon be using sewage as processing water at their facilities. 

 Nishith Dand, chairman,   (CII), central Gujarat zonal council said, “CII and VMC is working closely to develop a model where sewage could be used as process water for industries. This is a unique model in the country. Currently, the civic bodies have to spend money to treat the sewage water and on the other hand industries have to spend money to buy water.” 
 
 “Once this project is implemented, the sewage water will be an asset to VMC rather than liability,” Dand said during the central Gujarat zonal annual meeting 2017 held in the city on Friday. 
 
 VMC currently has several sewage treatment plants in the city and the treated water is released in Vishwamitri River. 
 
 Speaking during the conclave, Dr Vinod Rao, municipal commissioner said that “The city that is witnessing major restructuring will soon have a multi-storey urban transport hub near the railway station. The hub will have multi-storey parking as well as a bus station. It will also have an underground tunnel so that travellers, visitors and passengers could directly park their vehicles and move to the railway station or bus stand.”
 
 “The city will immensely benefit due to its geographical location as it’s the centroid for Dahej, Rajpipla and Dholera zone,” Rao added.
