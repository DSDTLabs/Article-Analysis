PATNA: Three months after Rs 18.96 lakh was looted from three employees of Sneh Petrol Pump on Patna-Masaurhi road under Gaurichak police station of the district on June 12, police on Tuesday arrested six criminals for their alleged involvement in the crime. The employees of the petrol pump were on their way to the local branch of Punjab National Bank to deposit the cash when the criminals intercepted them.

 The arrested criminals have been identified as Pramod Kewat alias Rahul, Rahul Kumar alias Bauwa, Rahul Kumar Chandra, Krishnakant Tiwary alias Chunnu (son of an Armyman), Nitish Kumar and Ravi Kumar.
 
 Patna SSP   said the bank passbook of the petrol pump and cash deposit receipts were recovered from Pramod’s residence at Gaurichak. Police had raided Pramod’s house after grilling Wazir Ali, who was arrested in connection with the case at Sonepur recently.
 
 The SSP said the gang has 11 members from Muzaffarpur, Saran, Jehanabad and Patna. “The criminals had used the looted money to buy expensive items and repay loans,” Maharaaj said, adding Krishnakant is son of Shobakant Tiwary, an Armyman.
