BHOPAL: In a major crackdown, the   government has issued notices to 79 companies and individuals allegedly involved in mining and processing of lime stones in Katni district for not paying royalty. The dues could add up to hundreds of crores, say sources.

 Most of these mines are in Jhukehi village in Katni’s Vijayraghogarh. Apart from Katni, rich deposits of lime stone are found in Satna, Rewa, Dhar, Neemuch and Damoh districts.
 
 Officials noticed that these companies were mining lime stone without diversion of agricultural land, say sources. “They have not been able to produce any documents related to the mining lease. This has been going on for many years. The royalty which government should have collected from these people over decades is in hundreds of crores,” said an officer.
 
 These companies have been given a second reminder to submit authorisation letters of mining. “We have sent the notices on the basis of the list that we got from the district industries department. If they do not respond, strong action will be initiated to recover the royalty,” he said.
 
 The administration has given them time to settle dues of royalty. It has asked for an account of the total quantity of limestone bought from other sources and consumed in the factory. They have to pay royalty on the quantity of limestone consumed, said an officer. Most of the companies plan to seek legal redress against the notices.
 
 According to sources, the dues for each company run into crores. In other districts, like Satna, cement companies have entered into lease agreements with collectors to mine for a specific period of time and pay royalty.
