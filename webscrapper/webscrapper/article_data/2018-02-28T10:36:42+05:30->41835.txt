INDORE: The Indore bench of high court on Tuesday granted stay on two orders issued by the collector regarding safety of school buses and filing of affidavit until a similar matter is decided at the court’s single bench. 

 The stay was granted in writ appeal filed by the association of unaided CBSE schools society by division bench of   and Justice   after hearing preliminary arguments made by them and state government. 
 
  
  
 The schools association through advocate Gaurav Chhabra argued t hat collector had no jurisdiction to pass any additional order in addition to pre-existing CBSE guidelines and   order. 
 
 State government through additional advocate general   argued that collector had complete power to pass an order under Section 144 of CrPC in furtherance to CBSE guidelines and Supreme Court’s orders. 
 
 “We also raised the point that if court grants a stay on order passed by the collector, six PILs which have sought action against erring school officials will also be stayed since we won’t be at liberty to take any action,” Dwivedi added. 
 
 The matter pending before single bench of high court, regarding same issue, has been filed by association of schools affiliated to ICSE board. They challenged the collector’s orders on the grounds that they were contrary to Motor Vehicle Act and Supreme Court guidelines and due process of law was not followed while making these amendments.
 
 A reply from the state government has been sought in this petition, whereas another similar petition with the same grounds was disposed by single bench, with liberty to schools association to raise their grievance before the collector.
