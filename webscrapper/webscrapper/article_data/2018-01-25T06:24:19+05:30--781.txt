LUCKNOW: Continuing their attacking spree and unfazed by heavy police presence, armed miscreants stormed another house just a kilometre away from   police station on Wednesday.

 However, SP (rural)   denied the attack and told TOI that he was present near the spot when the incident was reported. He agreed though that a villager fired two rounds as a panic reaction around 2am after which a police team reached the spot. 
 
 The villager, businessman  , lodged a complaint with the police but it has not been converted into an FIR as yet.
 
 Khan said that between 2am and 3am, a group of miscreants reached Gallamandi locality, a kilometre from Malihabad police station.
 
 "I heard a commotion outside and went on my terrace apprehending an attack by dacoits. I saw some men lurking outside my house and raised an alarm," he said. Later, Khan opened fire to intimidate the miscreants. 
 
 Villagers soon assembled with sticks and licensed weapons. The miscreants had to retreat and disappeared in the darkness. Police arrived soon after, Khan said. 
 
 Village pradhan Awadesh Yadav told reporters that at the time of the incident, police were combing the forest cover in Kakori, Malihabad, Mall and other rural pockets. 
 
 "It seems the miscreants knew of the police action and they chose another route, avoiding police teams, to reach Zibran's house," Yadav said. 
 
 He added that if they had not been alert or armed, the dacoits would have wreaked havoc in their houses.
 
 "Despite Lucknow police being on a war-footing to nab dacoits and launching a night vigil in rural pockets, the miscreants dared to attack a house again in Malihabad. They seem to have no fear of police," said  , a villager.
