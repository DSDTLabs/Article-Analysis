Ghaziabad: The anti-corruption cell of Ghaziabad police arrested an entertainment   official on Thursday for allegedly accepting a   of Rs  ,000. The official, Ram Awadh Verma, posted as district   tax   of Ghaziabad, was caught red-handed by anti-corruption sleuths.

 Verma allegedly received the bribe from Nazakat Khan, a Loni-based cable TV network operator. Anti-corruption sleuths told TOI that Verma had demanded Rs 2 lakh from Khan in order to forego government revenues to the tune of several lakhs of rupees. Khan operates a firm by the name of Sama Cable TV Network in Loni. “Khan had run up entertainment tax dues to the tune of around Rs 12 lakh inclusive of GST over a long period of time which Khan had not paid. Verma issued a notice to Khan to pay up the dues. When Khan met him last week, Verma demanded that he pay a bribe of Rs 2 lakh after which account books would be tweaked to reduce the total amount of taxes due,” anti-corruption cell officer J K Tomar said.
 
 However, Khan complained to police about Verma’s arm-twisting tactics. He promised to meet Verma with an initial instalment of Rs 50,000 at the multi-level parking facility near the district headquarters on Thursday. Sleuths caught Verma red-handed from the parking lot. An FIR has been registered again Verma at Kavi Nagar police station under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. TNN
