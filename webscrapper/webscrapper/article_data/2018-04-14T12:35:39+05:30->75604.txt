MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has ordered notice to the officer of the   temple in   in   district on a plea seeking to hold the temple festival. 

 One N S Ramaraj from Rajapalayam filed the plea. It came up for hearing before the division bench of justices C T Selvam and A M  . The petitioner’s counsel said that Arulmigu Mariamman temple is in existence in Rajapalayam from time immemorial. Every year, annual ‘fire walk’ (pookuzhi) festival would take place there, in which thousands of people would attend. It was scheduled to be conducted from April 19 to April 30 this year. Now, due to dispute between two communities, the special officer of the temple has stopped the festival by issuing a prohibitory order. Due to that the devotees who started fasting are unable to complete it. Hence, it was necessary to issue a direction to the special officer to hold festival as per schedule.
 
 Following it, the court ordered notice to the officer and adjourned the case.
