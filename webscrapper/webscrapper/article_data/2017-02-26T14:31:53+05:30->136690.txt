The one question that's been haunting   Amaren is 'eppo sir kalyanam'. When we met him for a chat, we couldn't resist asking the same. 'This has become the one question that I am asked whenever I set out. But honestly, I am yet to find my girl,' says Premgi. So, what kind of a girl he's looking for? 'I want to get married to a proper Tamil ponnu...someone who follows the Tamil culture. I am still looking for her,' he laughs, adding, 'Even my relatives have been asking me. But once I meet my kind of a girl, I will get married.'

  The actor has presently wrapped up shooting for   with   and  , for which he is also composing the music.
