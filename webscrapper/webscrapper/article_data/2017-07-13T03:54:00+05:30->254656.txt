Panaji: A Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising four police officials will be constituted to probe matka activities in the state, the government told the high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday.  The SIT would consist of SP Bossuet Dâ€™Silva, PI Krishna Sinari and two PSIs. The investigation will be monitored by retired high court judge A P Lawande and government approval is awaited, public prosecutor S R Rivonkar told the high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday. Activist Kashinath Shetye, in his public interest litigation (PIL), had alleged rampant matka activities in the state. He also alleged a nexus between police and matka operators, as well as an involvement of politicians.  The petitioner sought a CBI investigation in the case. Shetye argued that the raids conducted by crime branch were not big enough, also it is not prudent to hand over the investigation to the police as some of them are allegedly providing a helping hand to matka operators in exchange for monetary benefits. Rivonkar while arguing why it was difficult to fully contain matka activities, told the court that some of the operators are based outside Goa. They run their operations from states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat. He also informed the court, in detail, of the number of raids conducted and arrests made by the crime branch. Thee matter will be next heard on Wednesday.
