The bold trailer of   which shows actor   smoking pot and locking lips with his co-star has become the talk of T-town. “Trust me, my phone hasn’t stopped ringing the last couple of days. I’ve been flooded with congratulatory calls, the response has been quite overwhelming,” says the actor, who plays a chain smoker who gets addicted to alcohol. 
“The film is based on a true story. I play a brilliant young medico, Arjun Reddy, who is in love with a college mate. He is a very intense character who has a very short fuse, and due to a quirk of fate, ends up as an alcohol addict,” says Vijay, who admittedly picked up smoking to play the role. 
 And what about kissing, we’re guessing he’d have some prior experience to count on? He laughs it off saying, “Well, we were just trying to be natural and portray real love. When people are in love they kiss and if they didn’t, it would be weird (laughs).”
 Looks like the actor is definitely not shying away from experimenting with unconventional roles. His next is a supernatural comic thriller directed by newcomer  . “The film revolves around a cab, a cabbie and an experiment gone wrong. And I play an uneducated brash cab driver who wants to make easy money and and thus he decides to take up a cab driver’s job. How ‘he’s taken for a ride’ and what happens makes for a dark suspense comedy.”
