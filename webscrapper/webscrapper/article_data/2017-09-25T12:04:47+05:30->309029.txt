Actor   bought his mother a house to thank her for helping him get through drama school. 

  
  
 
 The ' ' star said his family helped him in realizing his acting dreams. "I bought my mother a house last year, I'm very proud to say... My mother especially, they were all very excited about it. My auntie, my father, my mother, my stepfather, it's about 40-50 pounds (to audition), probably USD 90 or something like that, and they each gave me the money to go and audition."
 
 "And they each helped me get accommodation down there when I wasn't able, I stayed with friends and things, it was a real family effort to pay for me to audition for drama school."
 
 "When I got this place at RADA, and I was very lucky - I (auditioned) at a couple other places, but it felt like something that we'd achieved and it's still, the success I've had still very much feels like my family's success,"   said. 
 
 The actor said his family wanted him to do something that made him happy. "I'm not from an affluent background in any way, so there was never that (directive from my family) to, 'Go and be a lawyer because you'll make more money.'"
 
 "There was never any expectation I would make money so it was (encouragement) to go and do what makes you happy and I think they felt I was good at it, and that was lovely to have that support," he said.
