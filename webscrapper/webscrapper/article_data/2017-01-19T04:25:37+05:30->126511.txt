Till a hydraulic crane reached the spot, vehicles moved on only one lane of the bridge. All the three lanes of the Vashi creek bridge became operational after the tempo was towed away. As the vegetables were smashed and scattered, the lanes had become slightly slippery. So vehicles were allowed to ply only after properly cleaning the lane to prevent skidding, especially of bikes. As the entire operation was time consuming, the vehicles moved at snail's pace. The traffic movement was restored to normalcy around 4 pm.”
