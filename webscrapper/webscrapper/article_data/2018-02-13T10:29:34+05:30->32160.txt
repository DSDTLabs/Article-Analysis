KOLKATA: Lady  , the famous government college of Kolkata has triggered a controversy by its new mandate. The college has given notice that feeding of dogs within college campus is completely prohibited. Any teaching or non-teaching staff or student found feeding the dogs will be fined by Rs 2,000.

 Already two people have been fined for doing the same. But the actual law is quite different. The law says that nobody can stop an animal lover to feed them. Last Saturday, animal lover   filed a complaint to the animal welfare board. 
 
 The honorary welfare officer of the animal welfare board   told that on Monday a notice has been sent to the college authority. He further said that feeding stray dogs is both lawful and helpful. 
 
 President of lady Brabourne college   demanded that she was forced to take such step after receiving numerous complaints by students and parents about dog attacks in college campus. 
 
  minister   knew nothing about the notice. After being heard, he said that the college authority may inform the matter to Kolkata corporation.
