PATNA: A fire broke out at   RJD MLA Mohammad Nawaz Alam’s residence on   at 6.30am on Monday. One of his drivers sustained minor injuries while sleeping in the garage where the fire broke out. 

 Sources said the fire was caused due to short-circuit in the garage.
 
  told   he was in Ara when the incident occurred. “I received a call from my family members around 6.36am and rushed back to Patna.” He blamed the electricity department for the fire. “We have complained to PESU about the wires dangling outside and inside the house. I have also written a letter to the chief minister’s office, but no one ever came to attend the complaint. Due to the negligence of electricity department, such incidents happen,” he said.
 
 He also urged the government to take appropriate action against the culprits. “It is a serious matter and I will raise it in the assembly during the next session,” he said.
 
 “The government keep talking about the improvement in electricity supply but the department fails to respond even to assistance calls. If such incidents can happen in posh area, one can imagine the poor wiring condition in remote areas of the state,” Alam said and added: “When the department does not hear our request, how can one expect the officials to entertain a common man’s complaint.”
 
 However, electricians who reached there to repair the fault and assess the damage claimed they never got any complaint from Alam in the past.
