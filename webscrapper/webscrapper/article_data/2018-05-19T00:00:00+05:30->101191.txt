One of the requisites for a portion of director Narendra Babu’s next offering,  , was a corporate set up away from Bengaluru. While he could have shot it in a place like Noida, the director and his team not only had the good fortune to head to Dubai, but they also got to shoot at the world renowned   tower. “About 30% of the film is set in Dubai, something that producer   helped us with, given that he is based out of there. During our eight-day schedule, we needed to can a few scenes in an office space, apartment and the surroundings of the city. One of Harish’s friends has an office and flat at Burj Khalifa, which was made available for us,” says the director. 

  Getting to their shoot location, though, was easier said than done. “We had planned a two-hour shoot at Burj Khalifa with Radhika (Chetan) and Anant (Nag) sir, and the rest of the crew. Getting past the building’s security took us a long time, owing to their strict protocols. In fact, we had to go through nearly three hours of security checks while going up and almost that much time while heading out also. But the experience of being atop the skyscraper was amazing,” says Narendra. 
 
  In the film, Radhika plays a corporate honcho, who crosses paths with Anant.
