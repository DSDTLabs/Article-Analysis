VADODARA: From citizens to workers of political parties to lawyers, thousands of them realized that several e-challans were issued in their names months ago, but were never delivered, after the city police department started the online payment facility of fines.

 However, several legal experts have questioned the legal validity of the e-challans which were issued months ago. In fact, several lawyers protested against the system and burnt copies of e-challans outside   on Tuesday. The city unit of   too made representations to city police commissioner   over the issue.
 
 Lawyers took out a rally in the Nyay Mandir area opposing the issuance of e-challans in large numbers and later burnt the copies of these challans. “The police issue e-challans when a person is caught on their cameras for not wearing helmet or seat belt. But, they are not verifying the fact whether the person is still in possession of the vehicle or not,” said Kamal Pandya, a lawyer.
 
 He added, “When a citizen pays the fine online, an extra charge is levied by bank, but the police should make it clear that they are not issuing a bill but a challan for violating the law.” Several lawyers, including minister of state for sports, youth and cultural activities Rajendra  , said that the police cannot take cognizance after six months if the offence is punishable with fine only.
 
 In several cases, citizens have learnt about latest e-challans in their names along with those which were issued several months ago through online payment website. In some cases citizens have also found e-challans in their names which were issued in 2016 but were never delivered to their homes.
 
 Since violation of law by not wearing helmet or seat belt is punishable with fine, the e-challans stand legally invalid. Trivedi added,
