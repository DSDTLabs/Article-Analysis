 The facility, to be launched shortly, will facilitate internet access within the sprawling campus. A memorandum to this effect was signed in presence of BAMU Vice-chancellor BA Chopade and telecom company authorities.
 
 "The university will not have to pay any money towards providing the Wi-Fi as the telecom company will bear expenses for the same. Hundreds of students along with members of teaching and non-teaching staff could avail the facility," Chopade said.
 
 The BAMU authorities said free Wi-Fi could also help in conducting video-conferencing among other important work that requires internet connectivity.

 The telecom company is said to have also shared its plans to provide free Wi-Fi on campuses of all colleges affiliated with BAMU. "The company is also interested in offering technical course regarding telecom operations. Also, the company has expressed willingness to give priority to talented BAMU students in job opportunities," authorities said.
 
 Meanwhile, student unions have reacted cautiously to the latest development. "It remains to be seen whether the telecom company concerned do not use BAMU to serve its commercial interests. The university authorities therefore need to trade cautiously in this regard," said Tukaram Saraf, a student activist.
 
 Another student said she was excited with the arrival of Wi-Fi facility. "Several students hailing from humble background study at BAMU and cannot afford high speed internet. Let us hope that these students are benefitted from Wi-Fi facility," she said.
