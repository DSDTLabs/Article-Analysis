ROHTAK: With number of Jat protesters swelling at the dharna site at Jassia, traffic on National Highway-71A was disrupted once again on Monday.

 All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) chief Yashpal Malik said that when such a large gathering assembles at a place, these things were common. But there was no need to panic as a   comprising Jat leaders was keeping a tab on it, he added.
 
 Malik said that they have formed a special committee to look after the vehicular traffic movement on NH-71A and an additional neighbouring field was being prepared to adjust more people at the dharna site.
 
 Committee members had chopped off the standing wheat crop in over an acre behind the dharna spot for the purpose.
 
 Meanwhile, the condition of   (JJS) activists observing fast since January 31 worsened on Monday.
 
 While the JJS dharna commenced at Sector 6 in Rohtak on January 27, three youth activists, including the convener of the JJS, began an indefinite fast on January 31.
 
 As the fasting youths refused to have any food or medication, intravenous fluid was administered on fasting JJS convener Rahul Dagar alias Daduji and his companion Vikesh Dahiya. The condition of third activist Monu Farmana is also stated to be critical.
 
 The youths have refused to have any food or medication until their demands are met.
