Tuticorin: The government order (GO) to shut down the Sterlite copper smelter unit in Tuticorin permanently and its subsequent locking down are yet to make a positive impact on the families of some of those killed in the police firing. While postmortem was performed on seven of the 13 victims, an advocate speaking for the families of five of the six remaining victims demanded the presence of ballistic experts and one of the family members during post-mortem. 

 With the GO passed on Monday, it was expected that the families might agree to accept the mortal remains by softening their earlier resistance. However, they were particular about the presence of experts during postmortem. “Families of the deceased are still sceptical of the GO since in the past the factory had functioned even after the state government opposed it. Shutting down the Sterlite unit was our demand but the culprits behind the killings in police firing should be punished,” the advocate speaking for the families of five deceased victims said while terming the GO as temporary relief. The families had sought neutral supervision during the post-mortem and particularly, a ballistic expert, to identify whether the bullet fired was from a short range. 
 
 Meanwhile, A Marx, national president of National Confederation of Human Rights Organisation (NCHRO), claimed that families of seven deceased victims that his team met were particular about a transparent postmortem. “Closing the factory permanently was one of their chief demands which was addressed but the kith and kin of victims in police firing want to know what kind of weapon was used and other factors that caused the deaths,” Marx added. Police as well as health department sources said that all the 13 bodies have been kept at the Tuticorin GH. The Madras high court had directed the state government to preserve the bodies of the victims till May 30.
