ALLAHABAD: In an attempt to   during  , officials of   and   have taken up   lessons with development agencies and other private units. At least one or two ponds are being dug up in each of over 2,000 villages of the district under MNREGA to collect rain water. 

 Chief development officer (CDO), Allahabad, Samuel Paul N said the ponds would collect rain water in rural areas. 
 
 Experts said that a 100 sq mt structure can recharge around 80,000 liters of water in a year. For that, prominent government and private buildings must have water harvesting system in urban pockets. The authorities are currently carrying out a survey to find out the exact number of buildings with rain water harvesting system. 
 
 Harvested rain water can be stored in sub-surface ground water reservoirs by adopting artificial recharge techniques to meet household needs through storage in tanks.
 
  An expert at the ground water department said, "The necessity for rooftop rain water harvesting has been felt to meet the demand for water and to reduce the run-off which chokes storm drains. It also helps in reducing ground water pollution and in improving its quality. Rainwater also improves the quality of ground water through dilution when recharged and the system is not expensive."
