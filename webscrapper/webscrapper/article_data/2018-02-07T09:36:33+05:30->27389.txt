NAGPUR: Customers at   branches are being inconvenienced and made to wait to get their transactions completed ever since a software update was undertaken on January 29.

 Bank staffers said that the server is extremely slow and they are able to cater to the needs of merely a handful of customers per hour. Officials said the problem is across the country.
 
 Only one of the computers in the four cash withdrawal counters were working at the Sadar branch. “Our computers have crashed as the server is failing to take the load. Only one is functional hence there is a delay in work. A group of people were waiting for their turn since morning and we completed their work when the servers started responding in the afternoon,” said an employee.
 
 The software, upgraded from Finacle 7x to 10x across India, was designed by  , said a bank employee. The ATMs and cash deposit machines are working without any hitch.
 
 A senior official at the Sadar branch however said there were “no problems”. “The workflow is fine with nominal delay and no such glitches have been reported.” 
 
 According to a senior staffer at the   branch said the problem would be “resolved in 2-3 days”. “We assumed that their would be initials hiccups after the transition to a new system on Monday, January 29 and wanted to avoid causing inconvenience to customers. We sent SMS alerts and put up notices in branches in advance and requested customers to complete their urgent banking transactions before January 25.”
