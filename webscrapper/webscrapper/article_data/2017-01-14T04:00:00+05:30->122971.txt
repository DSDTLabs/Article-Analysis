Surat: Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd, a leading diamond company in the city, may face action under section 7A of Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 for violating the provisions of the act. 

 Savji Dholakia, a diamond baron who had gifted cars, flats and jewellery to his employees as Diwali bonuses, twice in the last two years, was in news last month for evasion of his liabilities towards provident fund (PF) of workers of his unit. The Employee Provident Fund Organization’s (EPFO), Surat regional branch served a notice to his company for evading provident fund to the tune of Rs16.66 crore. In an order issued last week after a two-year investigation, the PF authorities asked the company to deposit the sum in 15 days, along with penal interest at 12% per annum and annual damages of 25%.
 
 The EPFO office stated that the company employs around 3,165 employees but registered only 17 employees, thereby violating the provident fund and Factories Act rules. The company has not paid EPF for its employees for so many years.
 
 The generous boss hit the headlines when he gave away 491 cars and 207 flats to his employees under his Diwali bonus programme in 2014. Again in 2016, Dholakia gave away 1,260 cars, 400 flats and pieces of jewellery to his employees. 
 
 “The notice stage has already passed. We have seized documents and assessment proceedings have already been completed. The company is bound to pay Rs16.66 crore of the outstanding provident fund payments to the EPFO. After Uttarayan, we may think of launching proceedings against the company,” said an officer of EPFO. 
 
 EPFO’s regional provident fund commissioner P B Verma said, “We may launch proceedings under section 7A against the company for violating the EPF & MP Act, 1952. The company is yet to turn up to deposit the assessed amount despite the notice.”
 
 The company officials refused to comment.
