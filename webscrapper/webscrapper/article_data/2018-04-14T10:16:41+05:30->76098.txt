  : Allegations of   workers pushing family of a patient to donate his organs before he was declared brain dead, have prompted   administration to direct the NGO to refrain from approaching patients without getting a clearance from authorities. 

 A complaint letter, purportedly written by the family of  , 20, went viral on social media. 
 
 The letter accused Muskan Group volunteers of forcing them to donate his organs.
 
 Though hospital administration denied having received such complaint, its superintendent Dr VS Pal issued instructions to follow laid down protocol for organ donation.
 
 "As per rules, the patient's family members should not be approached by counsellors, as part of their work to pursue them for organ donations, before he is declared brain stem dead by a panel of doctors," MYH superintendent Dr VS Pal told TOI. "No one from the team of doctors and paramedical staff should approach the family members for counselling," he said.
 
 The MY Hospital does not have an organ donation counsellor, so services of Muskan Group are sought, he added.
 
 "We will not allow anyone to approach patients' family for organ donation before panel of doctors declares patient brain stem dead," Dr Pal said.
 
 According to norms, a panel of doctors conducts a series of tests twice within a time frame of 4-6 hours, before declaring a patient brain dead.
 
 MYH had made the headlines by becoming the first government-run hospital in the state to carryout organ retrieval on December 30, last year. 
 
 While the hospital was mulling over plans to strictly put in place the protocol, Sachin died at 7am on Thursday. The doctors performed autopsy before handing over body to family members.
 
 He had met with an accident on April 6 and referred to MY Hospital on April 10, with critical head injury.
