NEW DELHI: As the   cancelled the RK Nagar bypoll over use of money power, Congress leader   on Monday took a jibe at Prime Minister   asking if his demonestisation drive has achieved the desired results.

 "We were told   has put an end to black money. Was money distributed in R K NAGAR white money?," the former   and home minister said in a tweet.
  
  
 The Election Commission had last night cancelled the April 12 bypoll to the RK Nagar Assembly constituency in  , saying the electoral process has been "seriously vitiated" by parties through use of money power.
 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while announcing the demonestisation decision on November 8, had said that the move would curb blackmoney besides getting other positive results.
 
 The bypoll to RK Nagar was necessitated due to the death of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.
