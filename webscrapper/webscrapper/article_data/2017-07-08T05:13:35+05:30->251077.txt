MUMBAI: Families of the three  , believed to be among the first victims of the 2008 terror attack for which   was hanged, have shot off a letter complaining of neglect after PM   greeted  , a survivor from Chabad House, in Israel and promised him and his family long-term visas so that they could visit India anytime.

 “You are going to foreign countries and making big announcements, viz long visit visas to Moshe Holtzberg, but have not even bothered to ask about the three fishermen... The Kasab group killed four fishermen of the   boat. Captain Amarsingh Solanki's family was compensated immediately, but have you or your officials ever paid a visit to honour the three families who are suffering from financial crunch?“ says the open letter addressed to Modi and signed by the three Navsari-based families and NGO SEVA 's Kannubhai Sukdiya. The families, helped by SEVA, had to fight a legal battle for five years before getting the death certificates of the three fishermen last year. The certificates are necessary to claim compensation, and since their bodies had not been found, legally, they could be declared dead only after seven years of going missing.
 
 “When Modi was the Gujarat CM, he came to several programmes, but never visited these families. Those who died in the five star hotels in Mumbai have been compensated, but not these fishermen from Modi's state. Nanu's daughter was three and his son was two when he was killed; Natwar was the only earning member of his family and we look after his grandmother; Prabhu's daughters have grown up, but they don't have the money to get them married.Who will marry them?“ said Sukdiya.
