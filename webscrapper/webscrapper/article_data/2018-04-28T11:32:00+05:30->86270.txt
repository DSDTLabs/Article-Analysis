JAIPUR: Opposition   organised a special protest against the rising prices of petrol and diesel by pulling 51 cars with the help of rope and camels at Kiran Path Circle, Mansorover on Friday. 

 The protest was organised under the leadership of Congress party's state secretary Suresh Mishra along with some social and business organisations. Mishra said, "Due to this arbitrary decision of petrol price hike, common man is at the receiving end and is feeling cheated by the   government. People are fed up due to the price hike and BJP is trying to take us back to ancient era. That is why we have organised the protest in this manner to symbolize that if the petrol price is not reduced people will have no money left in their pocket to drive."
 
 Jaipur city Congress head Pratap Singh Khachariyawas while addressing the media said the state and central government is deliberately trying to loot the public, even though by decreasing the excise tax and others measures this price hike could be reduced. "After this decision, BJP government's real face is out to the public to see. People have gathered here to show their anger," said Khachariyawas.
