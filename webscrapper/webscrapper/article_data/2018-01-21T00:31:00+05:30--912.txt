Tirunelveli: A day before the India premiere of the Tamil film ‘Kadal Kuthiraigal’ at a theatre in Tirunelveli, the director of the film, Pugalenthi Thangaraj, was running from pillar to post to ensure that the screening is not stopped. Trouble began as news about the premiere of the film on the Sri Lankan Tamil issue and anti-nuclear protests at Kudankulam got published in newspapers on Friday.

 “The owner of the theatre got annoyed as intelligence agencies started visiting his theatre and calling him over phone several times on Friday. The owner asked me to get a no objection certificate (NOC) from the police to screen the film. There is no need for a NOC for a film that has been cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) after 68 cuts,” the 61-year-old director said.
 
 On Saturday he petitioned top police officials in Tirunelveli, who told the director that there is no need for a NOC and that the police have not and will not stop the screening of the film on Sunday (January 21). 
 
 “But the theatre owner insisted on it as he did not want to land in trouble. We have also taken up the issue with the film producers’ association as it should not happen again,” he said.
 
 This is not the first time the director is facing such an issue. He recalled that in 2011, his film Uchithanai Muharnthaal on Sri Lankan Tamil crisis, starring Sathyaraj, Seeman and Nassar had faced a similar problem. “A leading Chennai-based film distributor released it but faced a lot of trouble due to pressure from police and intelligence units. The film was released but the initial hurdles affected the film post release as well,” he added.
