 As per the data available with the   department, the number of cases in   alone would constitute 40 to 60 per cent of communicable diseases reported the state. This has been the scenario in the past five years Â­ a fact which doesn't sink in easily.
 
 The ground reality would be slight different from the picture given by  . The cases of dengue, chikungunya and leptospirosis may be a bit high. But, the high rate of communicable diseases as revealed by the records has other reasons too. First of all, it is the government hospitals and labs which do almost 90 per cent of data recording. This means, the private hospitals which cater to around 60 per cent of patient services in the state provide just 10 per cent of the statistics. In Thiruvananthapuram, the number of government hospitals and those depending on government hospitals are high compared to other district. 
 
 So, unlike other districts, more cases are being recorded. Public labs in Thiruvananthapuram also help in diagnosis of cases thereby increasing the number.In other districts, people depend mostly on private labs which are not big in size. They rarely provide data to the state government, though there is standing order for sharing such details with the government. There are allegations that those getting placement in various posts in health department in the district are mostly people with backing of political masters. So, these officials rarely do field work. There is very little surveillance and measures to contain such diseases on the field.
 
 Fast urbanization is another reason for spread of communicable diseases.Unlike other districts, the entire Thiruvananthapuram district is like an extended city or urban area. It would require a detailed study to get a comprehensive picture of the various factors that are contributing to the high number of cases recorded from the district.
