LUCKNOW: Two minor girls were murdered and their bodies dumped in   in Hargaon area of   district. The bodies were discovered on Sunday morning and stones and salt were also found in the two sacks dumped at a distance.

 Local villagers spotted the two sacks in the canal on Sunday morning and informed police, said superintendent of police, Sitapur, Sureshrao A  .
 
 “The two sacks had been dumped at some distance. On opening them bodies of two girls were found,” said SP Kulkarni.
 
 “The two girls aged about 7 and 12 are yet to be identified. Plastic tape was found wrapped on their face and had been used to gag them,” the SP added.
 
 “Post-mortem reports should be available on Monday and would be examined thereafter. As marks have been found on the necks of the two girls, it seems that they were strangulated after being gagged,” said Kulkarni.
 
 Police have been unable to find out who murdered the two minor girls and dumped their bodies in the canal.
 
 The sacks were found 3.5 km apart in the canal in an area on Sitapur and Lakhimpur border. Investigators were trying to identify the vehicles that had ventured on the embankment along the canal.
 
 Police officials believe that the murder was executed after proper planning as bricks had been put in the sack so that it doesn’t come up and the bodies are not spotted. Besides, salt was also put in the sacks as it helps in quick decomposition of the bodies.
 
 However the sacks were washed ashore and were spotted by local villagers.
 
 Sitapur has remained in the news lately for gruesome crimes against women. A man from Bihar had thrown his four daughters off a running train in October 2017 and one of them had died.
