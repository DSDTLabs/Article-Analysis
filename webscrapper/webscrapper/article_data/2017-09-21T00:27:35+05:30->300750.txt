Police have altered the case against the teacher from whose hands the bat slipped and hit the boy to Section 304(2) of the IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). 
 
 P Visweswaran, 12, of Sithampoondi village near Paramathi in Namakkal district, was a Class VII student of a government school near Tiruchengode and stayed in a government backward classes hostel. On Sunday evening, the children were playing cricket when their teacher, M Kuppusamy, 38, joined them. When Kuppusamy attempted to hit the ball, the bat slipped from his hand and hit Visweswaran on the head.
 
 Visweswaran fell unconscious and was immediately taken to the Tiruchengode government hospital. Doctors referred him to the Salem super specialty hospital on Monday, where he slipped into a coma.
 
 During interrogation, fellow students told police that it was an accident. Based on the statements of witnesses, the Molasi police registered a case under Section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and arrested Kuppusamy. Subsequently, chief educational officer of Namakkal district P Usha placed him under suspension.
 
 Meanwhile, the boyâ€™s relatives refused to receive the body from the hospital after autopsy. They sat in front of the hospital and raised slogans against the police for not registering the case under SC/ST Act. After police informed them that the case had been altered they withdrew the protest.
