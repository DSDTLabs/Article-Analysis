Trichy: Continuing its skill development programmes for students, Anna Science Centre Planetarium on Monday organized various contests as part of national science day celebrations here on Monday. Titled ‘science for all, the event saw many take part in quiz, essay writing, elocution and drawing held mainly to pique their interest in the topic. Tamilnadu Science and Technology Centre director P Iyamperumal and joint director of collegiate education M M Senthamilselvi attended. The prizes were also distributecd for the winners. “I have been in Trichy for the past five years and the awareness towards science has been steadily increasing in the city,” said project director in-charge at Anna Science Centre – Planetarium, Lenin Tamilkovan. “The main reason for conducting contests for students is to make sure they are interested in the field of science,” he said. Tamilkovan said the students, based on the theme, came up with interesting ideas for essay writing and elocution contests. “Most of the students came up with different perspectives to explain their understanding of science. For instance, one student spoke about science using real life example -- through home appliance grinder, mixer etc.,” he said. He also said that the centre has been conducting many programmes apart from the recently concluded one. “Every month, we organise either ‘meet your scientist’ or ‘meet your medical expert programme. Both have yielded good response from the public,” he said. On March 25, a one-day programme – for women and girl in the morning and for men and boys in the evening – will be held. In the programme, an expert will talk on illnesses corresponding to respective genders.
