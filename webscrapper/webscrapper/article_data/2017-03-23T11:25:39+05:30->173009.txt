Nahid Afrin, an   Junior participant in 2015, has been in the news after reports of a fatwa being issued against her aimed at stopping a scheduled performance in her hometown Assam, made its way to the media. This was followed by tweets in support from the state Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, scriptwriter Salim Khan and singer Vishal Dadlani among others.

 On Tuesday, Nahid returned to the Indian Idol stage to perform her first playback from the   starrer Akira, “Raj Raj Ke”, and announced the release of her latest Assamese song. A source from the sets reveals that Sonakshi, who was a judge on the earlier show, was a celebrity guest on this episode. The actress who’d orchestrated Nahid’s Bollywood break, was happy to reminisce about their earlier reality show stint. Nahid thanked her for believing in her talent.
 
  
  
 Says the source, “Nahid admits that she was unsure of pulling off the Akira song when Sonakshi offered it to her. She was only 13 at the time. But the actress who had supported her publicly on the show, encouraged her. She’s indebted to her and to the Indian Idol team for helping her become a playback singer.”
 
 She also expressed her admiration for this year’s contestant  , whom she considers her ‘bhaiya’ and would want him to win this season of Indian Idol. She also thanked Vishal for his support during the recent controversy.
