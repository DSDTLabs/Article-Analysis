PANAJI: Approximately 750 different vehicles that were operating in the state to ferry election officials and utilities since January 20, have left Goa on Sunday, as the poll-related duties came to an end. Goans came out in large numbers on Saturday to elect their new state legislative assembly. 

 While trucks were used to transport food and utilities, buses were used to ferry paramilitary personnel and cars were designated for election observers and other officials on duty. At any particular station, two cars, and as many buses and trucks were deployed. These stations were spaced out approximately 20-25 km from each other.
 
 “We’ve been in Goa for a fortnight and faced no issues with regards to food or accessibility to parking. Goa police ensured that our vehicles were parked near a temple or police station,” said a truck operator, Deepak Jagtap.
 
 He, however, complained that accommodation facilities were not provided for by election authorities. “We would sleep in our trucks and use the blankets we had brought from home to protect ourselves from the cold,”   said, adding, “But, we got good food on time and ample of space to park. That was more important”.
