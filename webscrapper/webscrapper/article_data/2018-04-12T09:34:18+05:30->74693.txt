GUWAHATI:   went down to   0-3 in their   group-stage match at   here on Wednesday.

 
 Playing their third game in seven days and with Andrei Ionescu starting on the bench, the home team lost the match in the first half itself. Rubel Miya scored the first in the second minute, then   scored in the 17th and Kojima Seiya made it 3-0 in the 37th.
 
 In the second half though,   FC put on a much better show. Santosh Kashyap brought in Ionescu and even their fans finally arrived after being stuck in traffic for a long time. But Aizawlâ€™s hard work went in vain as they failed to hit the target even once.
 
 With this loss, Aizawl have lost all their three matches in the group stage so far and are lying at the bottom of the group. However, they will get a chance to avenge this loss when they play Abahani in Dhaka on 25th this month. It was a brilliant counter attack by Abahani Dhaka that helped them take the lead. Aizawl lost possession following a corner and Abahani found a lot of open space ahead of them. Emeka Onuoha passed it to Rubel, who lobbed it over the goalkeeper.
