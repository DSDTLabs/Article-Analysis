HYDERABAD: Monday night's mishap at the under-construction T-Hub (Phase 2) at Raidurgam has brought to fore the state government's disregard for safety standards, said experts. This is the second such incident that has rocked the city's IT corridor in a span of two months.

 The accident, experts pointed out, occurred right under the nose of the Telangana IT electronics and communication department that is in-charge of the construction of Phase 2 and the Telangana State   Ltd (TSIIC) that was entrusted with the responsibility of inviting proposals for awarding the contract.
 
 “The building collapse in Nanakramguda was simply a case of a private builder trying to cut corners. This incident, however, is more appalling since it is a government-backed project and the contract was awarded by a government body .This is a case of sheer negligence on part of the contractor and his inefficiency in implementing adequate safety systems,“ said M V Rajeshwar Rao, CEO of Confederation Of   Developers Association of India ( ), Hyderabad.
 
 Enquiries revealed that the contractor was also involved with construction of T-Hub's catalyst building at Gachibowli. After its successful completion, the firm bagged this current Rs 168-crore contract in October last year, said sources.
 
 Refuting charges of shoddy work by the contractor, E V Narasimha Reddy, vice-chairman and managing director of TSIIC maintained that the latest incident was only a 'freak acci dent'. He asserted that compensation of Rs 5 lakh each would be paid to the families of both the victims.
 
 “The mishap was simply a freak accident and did not occur due to the use of inferior quality construction material.While work might be put on hold for a few days, there will be no significant delay in the inauguration of the facility,“ Reddy maintained.
 
 Industry players, alarmed by the mishap, hoped that those in the construction business adopted more fool-proof safety standards at their sites.
