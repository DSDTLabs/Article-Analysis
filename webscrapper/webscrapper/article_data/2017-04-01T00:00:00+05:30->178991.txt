In terms of indirect taxes, multiple types of taxes tend to converge on any product or service over a period of time. The new regime, under PM  , has now decided on implementing GST — which simply means one nation, one tax. That’s the beauty and simplicity of GST.
 
 
 All products and services bear the burden of the cost of production and the cost of taxes. From a consumer point of view, be prepared for advantages as well as disadvantages. For example, India always had an excise regime, which means taxes as high as 32% on goods and services considered luxury. Now, under one tax, that will become cheaper. Cosmetics, cars, air conditioners and washing machines will become cheaper. On the flip side, something like edible oil, which is attracting 5% indirect tax now, will attract 12% under GST. Eating out at standalone restaurants is also likely to become costlier, as there will be 18% tax. Other than that, garments and footwear will become dearer. Having said that, there is still a lot of ambiguity on this subject, and we are also waiting for some days to go by.
 
 
 Yes, basic items are likely to suffer higher taxes and frivolous items will possibly get cheaper. We still don’t have clarity because of the bandwidth of 12-18% that GST is proposing. I am sure the government is concerned about the bottom of pyramid, and they will take care of their needs.
