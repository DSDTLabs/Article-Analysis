Nagpur: On Monday, the Maharashtra General Kamgar Union voiced its concern over employees of city bus service losing their jobs after it learned that the company entrusted to run the service in the city will be issued termination letter on April 8. At a press meet organized at Patrakar Bhavan, the union’s adviser Santosh Kanerkar said the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in 2011 had assured that the firm’s contract would be extended till 2020.  Four new private firms have now been contracted to run the bus service, the union said. Even with the addition of green buses and other new buses, the employees are uncertain of their induction into the new syndicate, the union stated.  The union also questioned the fresh recruitment drive initiated by NMC. Vansh Nimay was contracted to run the Starbus services in the city on April 1, 2007.  It had employed 1,400 people as bus drivers and conductors.
