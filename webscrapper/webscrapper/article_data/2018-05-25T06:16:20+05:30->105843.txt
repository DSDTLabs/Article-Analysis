LUCKNOW: Boys ruled the roost in  's undergraduate entrance exam, results of which were announced on Thursday. Of the eight UG courses, boys held the first rank in seven. 

 
 In BCom/BCom (hons), BSc (mathematics), BCA, BVoc (renewable energy), BVA/BFA, BSc (biology) and LLB (5 years), a boy had scored the highest among all candidates who appeared for the entrance test. 
 
  
 The toppers are Prasoon Rai, Karan, Aashwal Dixit, Shubham Shukla, Deepak Kumar, Aurindam Banerjee and Dhruv Singh respectively. It was only in BA/BA (hons) that a girl, Harshita Dubey, bagged the first place.
 
  In BSc (mathematics), there was not a single girl among the top 21 positions. Only eight made a place among the first 50. In LLB (5 years), there were only three girls in the top 10 and 15 among top 50. 
 
 Girls took a back seat in BCA as well. No girl candidate figured in the top five and only two made it to top 10. 
 
 Boys also scored well in bachelor of vocation in renewable energy and in bachelor of fine arts, where three and four girls made it to top 10 respectively. Only in BA/BA (hons) did girls bag most of the top 10 slots. 
 
 "For the past few years, it was girls who were top rankers, but this year, it's boys who have dominated the top positions. The results are opposite to class XII board exam results where girls outshone boys," said admission coordinator Anil Mishra. 
 
 He said the cut-off merit list will be declared by the university shortly. Counselling is likely to be held between June 11 and 25.
