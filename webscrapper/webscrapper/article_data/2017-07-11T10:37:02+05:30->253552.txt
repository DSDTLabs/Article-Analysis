LUCKNOW: The three   of Shravan Sahu—a Saadatganj businessman who was shot dead on February 1—will be declared absconders. Having secured non-bailable warrant against sub-inspector Dhirendra Shukla and constables Dhirendra Yadav and Anil Singh two months back, city police have initiated proceedings against the trio under IPC section 174.

 CBI is probing the case as role of city police was found suspicious in the entire episode, while legal proceedings to declare the three policemen absconders would be executed by city police.
 
 The 55-year-old businessman was gunned down allegedly by Aqeel Ansari, a listed criminal from Thakurganj. Before getting Sahu killed, Aqeel had murdered businessman’s son Ayush at Campbell road after a brawl outside a liquor shop in October 2015.
 
 While Sahu was pursuing the case aggressively, Aqeel’s bail order was revoked by court and he hatched a conspiracy along with his accomplices and the three policemen to eliminate the businessman. Four people were arrested for the murder, while three policemen absconded after their names surfaced in the conspiracy. CBI had filed charge-sheet against the group of four besides Aqeel in May and was probing the case.
 
 Chowk police CO Durga Prasad Tiwari said an FIR against the three will be registered for defying public orders. “We will move court thereafter to declare Shukla, Yadav and Singh absconders,” said Tiwari.
