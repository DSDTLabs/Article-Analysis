NEW DELHI: A day after   attacked Prime Minister   for his "incompetence", Union minister of textiles   today took to Twitter to troll the   scion. 

 "2G, Coal Scam, Common Wealth Games Scam, Augusta - Your definition of competence?" Irani said in a tweet.
 
 
  
 Taking a swipe at Rahul for his 'ache din' comment - yesterday he said 'acche din' will only come in 2019 - Irani tweeted, "Is this an admission that decades of Congress rule in our country were not Acche Din?"
 
  
  Quoting the Congress vice president's tweet that "for the first time in the country's history a Prime Minister of India is being ridiculed the world over", she asked if Rahul's tweet is "for (former PM)  ?"
 
  
 
 As of yet, Rahul has not deigned to respond to Irani's tweets.
 
 "The  , the RSS and Narendra Modi have weakened institutions like the RBI. For the first time in history, the Prime Minister of India is being ridiculed. The institution, the financial bedrock of the country has been ridiculed. The position of the RBI Governor has been ridiculed," Rahul had said while addressing a national convention of the Congress party.
