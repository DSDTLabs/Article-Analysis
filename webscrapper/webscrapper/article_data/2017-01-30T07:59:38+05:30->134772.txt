It may read that large tech parks becoming green is a good thing. But the trend will hit domestic consumers. Industrial consumption from the grid (state power supply) decreased by 7% in 2016-17 and continues to go down further.

 It is not just happening in   or tech parks but even manufacturing industries and small and   in Karnataka. Industries consume about 19.55% of the state's total energy sale.Most industries are now purchasing directly from the energy producers through Open Access where they have to pay for cross subsidy factors. If industrial consumers pull out of grid consumption, the burden of cross subsidy will entirely come on domestic consumers and it goes with out saying that Bengalureans will be have to bear the maximum brunt through increased  .
 
 The cost of manufacturing for the state has come down from 25% to 16% in the past 8 years. But this does not prove that industrial activity has reduced. My apprehension is that if manufacturing industries, particularly the small and medium-scale industries, move out of the grid, the social indices of the state's economy will fall.
 
 The government has only increased hurdles for investors in Bengaluru, after the investment is made and business is set up, by increasing power tariff. I have long been pitching for setting up 5MW solar power generators in all the districts, which will push the grid's capacity and also increase renewable energy consumption. The energy department only recently decided to set up 200MW plants in every taluk after the ministry of new and renewable energy set a target of 6,000MW of solar generation for Karnataka by 2021.
