AHMEDABAD: A video went viral on Monday in which a man is seen being beaten up by a group with lathis in Sector 5 of Gandhinagar. The video took social media by storm when it came to light that the beating was spurred by the man’s assaults on his wife. Sector 7 police station in   has registered cross-complaints and four persons have been arrested.

 According to investigators, Ratan Bharwad, a resident of Sector 5, Gandhinagar, is married to Hardik Bharwad, a resident of Nava Vadaj, Ahmedabad. The couple has a daughter. According to her relatives, the couple had a feud after he demanded a car. Hardik then allegedly beat up Ratan after an altercation that damaged her left eye and caused a miscarriage. 
 
 Rambhai Bharwad, Ratan’s father, told TOI that Ratan had come home after the attack but Hardik followed her and tried to assault her again — in her very home. The family felt that enough was enough. “She can’t see with her left eye,” he said. “The strife was caused by Hardik’s secret marriage two years ago even when the couple was already blessed with a baby girl. We had filed a complaint against him then. But persuaded by Ratan, who did not want to deprive her kid of a father, we did not pursue the matter further.”
 
 Now, the family has filed a complaint over the demand for dowry and physical and mental harassment against Hardik, Bharwad said. On March 19, after Hardik’s attempt to assault Ratan at her home, her cousins and relatives caught him as he was approaching his car and beat him up. The group also damaged Hardik’s car. 
 
 It was Ratan who intervened and rescued her husband. Hardik reached Ahmedabad and had himself admitted to a private hospital from where he lodged a complaint against his father-in-law and others. D D Sodha, the inspector of Sector 7 police station, said: “Hardik will soon be questioned and arrested. We are checking his health condition.”
