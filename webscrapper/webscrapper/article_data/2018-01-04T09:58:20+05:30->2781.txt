HYDERABAD: Once a  ,   in the   now lies in shambles.

 While the unkempt book racks and broken furniture are a common sight inside the library, the building’s exteriors too mirror its dilapidated state with the paint peeling off from its cracked walls.
 
 Water that drips from the cracked ceiling during monsoon is now threatening to damage the over 60,000 books the   houses.
 
 “The falling patronage itself says a lot about the state of the library. Sadly, this is a major library, and the only large-scale library the Old City residents have,” lamented Lokesh Kumar, a degree student who visits the library during weekends.
 
 “About 100 people visit the library to read newspapers everyday, but there are hardly any chairs for them to sit on. It is not in good shape,” he added.
 
 “The City Grandhalaya Samastha (CGS) authorities promised to build a better building a few years back but nothing has been done, not even minor repairs have been taken up,” 55-yearold Abdul Rahman, a regular at the library.
 
 Sameera Begum, a student and Shah Ali Banda resident, complained about the shortage of books. “The library has no books or computers. I came here for the first time today andI am disappointed,” she said, pointing out that most of the important books that students might need are dumped in one corner because there are not enough racks for them.
 
 When contacted, librarian Uma Rani said that she is not aware of any proposals for renovating the building or setting it up elsewhere.
 
 However, when contacted, CGS chairperson K Prasanna told TOI that plans are afoot to carry out the necessary repairs inside the library. She said CGS is also planning to ask the government to sanction a parcel of land in the Shah Ali Banda area to enable them to put up a new and better library for the residents of the Old City area.
