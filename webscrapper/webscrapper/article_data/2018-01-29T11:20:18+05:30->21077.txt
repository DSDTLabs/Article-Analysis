RANCHI:   (RU) will be the first state university to start a five-year integrated BA-LLB course from the next academic year. At present, the state universities, including RU, offer only a three-year LLB course, which can be pursued after completing graduation.

 RU's proposal of starting BA-LLB was sent to the   (BCI) around a year ago which was recently approved. A team of BCI is expected to visit Ranchi in February for inspection of the building of legal studies at Mohrabadi.
 
  on 30,000 sq. ft. area, the two-storeyed building has been constructed at a cost of Rs 4 crore. The building consists of a moot court, library, auditorium, computer room and other facilities.
 
 RU pro vice-chancellor Kamini Kumar said, "The legal studies building has been constructed and will be handed to us within 10 days. Once the BCI team inspects the building and approves it, the course would commence from the next academic year."
 
 The course fees and student intake will be decided after the process of appointing teachers commences.
 
 Talking about the benefits of the course, Kumar said, "Nowadays, many students are inclined towards studying law after intermediate but they cannot afford the fees of private colleges." She added, "Here at RU, the fee structure would be such that even students from financially weaker background are able to afford it. We will also try to take admission of as many as students as possible so that they all get an opportunity to pursue a course of their interest."
 
 After starting the five-year course, the next step would be to start the   course. "In the second phase, we would introduce the LLM course, so that students who complete their BA-LLB and are interested in pursuing higher education can get the facility here and do not have to migrate out of the state," Kumar said.
