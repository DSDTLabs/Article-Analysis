NEW DELHI: BSP chief Mayawatiâ€™s resignation from the Rajya Sabha was accepted on Thursday by chairman Hamid Ansari. The 61-year-old leader had submitted a fresh resignation letter as per the prescribed format, said a Rajya Sabha official.

  had on Wednesday resigned from the RS, accusing the ruling   and the Chair of not allowing her to raise the issue of anti-Dalit violence in Uttar Pradesh. However, the three-page resignation letter was rejected as it was not in the requisite format.
 
 The resignation seems to be an attempt by Mayawati to consolidate her core Dalit support base after her party suffered a massive setback in the UP assembly polls earlier this year. Mayawati has claimed that she was resigning from the House as she was not allowed to speak on the issue of crimes against her community members.
