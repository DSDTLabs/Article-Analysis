NAVI MUMBAI: The   may have bagged the 8th position in the   but residents say there are many dirty lanes to clean before the city can rest on its laurels. While the award has made all   happy, residents said that certain areas, especially internal areas in Vashi, Koparkhairane and Nerul have to struggle daily with   that needs to be tackled.

 “Areas like Bonkode , Koparkhairane, sector 9 , Vashi market area, internal lanes in Turbhe, Turbhe Stores , Turbhe gaon, APMC market area, eateries near railway station , bus stands and old housing societies are decidedly untidy,” said activist Arati Chauhan, a resident of sector 19, Nerul. 
 
  “All internal roads, by-lanes and approach roads should be garbage-free,” said Ramnath Mhatre of sector 22, Turbhe. Lalith Sakat from sector 10, Koparkhairane, added that garbage segregation should be taken up in earnest. —Indrani Basu
