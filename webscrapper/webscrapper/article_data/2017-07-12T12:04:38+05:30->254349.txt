 said he has nothing against   as the director-producer believes the censor board chief is simply acting like a follower of a deep-rooted ideology. The 65-year-old filmmaker said the   (CBFC) is not supposed to censor the content in films but grant certification. 

  
  
 "I have nothing against Pahlaj Nihalani. He is just doing the job of a mindset. Since time immemorial, I have been endorsing the removal of the censor board; it's not required. They should just certify films," Jha said in an interview. The producer was in the capital to promote his upcoming film ' '. 
 
 Jha, who has had his fair share of run-ins with the CBFC as a director in the past, said the censor board curbs creative freedom of the filmmakers. "Censor Board represents a mentality. It's not from today, it has been happening ever since. Whenever you give an authority to someone, you give them a power to use it in anyway - positive or negative. When you give authority to someone else, to make all these decisions, they have their own point of views."
 
 "And the CBFC is an authority that's been imposed on our thoughts, understanding and morality. We are wise enough to live our own lives and to take our own decisions," he said. The Alankrita Shrivastava-directed movie ran into a roadblock when the CBFC refused to certify the film, calling it "lady-oriented". 
 
 Later, the makers approached the   (FCAT), which directed the censor board to certify the film with few cuts. The movie features Ratna Pathak Shah, Konkona Sensharma, Aahana Kumra, Plabita Borthakur, Sushant Singh and Vikrant Massey. 
 
 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' will hit the screens on July 21.
