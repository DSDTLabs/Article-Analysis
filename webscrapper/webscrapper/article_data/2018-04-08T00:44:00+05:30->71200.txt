Salem: The founder of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK),  , on Saturday unveiled plans to take out a state-wide campaign in May to tell the people how chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam allegedly betrayed the state. 

 TTV, who was on his way to Dharmapuri to participate in a demonstration against the Centre for not forming Cauvery Management Board (CMB), said the present government would be toppled if the Madras high court pronounces a ‘favourable verdict’ in the disqualification of 18 MLAs.
 
 “V K Sasikala or I could have taken charge as the chief minister after the demise of J Jayalalithaa. Instead, Sasikala first nominated OPS and then EPS to the post. But they have betrayed the party and the state by joining hands with BJP,” he said.
 
 Pointing out that he still enjoys support of AIADMK cadres, TTV said they would openly back him when the situation arises.
 
 The RK Nagar MLA also made it clear that he would oppose neutrino, methane and hydro-carbon projects in the state as they would affect the large section of people.
 
 Batting for CMB, TTV said, “We will not rest until CMB is formed.” He also appealed the youths to boycott IPL matches to condemn the Centre for its failure to constitute CMB. “The CMB issue will make headlines across the world if we boycott the IPL matches and return the tickets,” he said. tnn
