BHAGALPUR: Union minister   Arjit Shashwat was granted   on Monday in the case of inciting violence while leading a religious procession without official permission through Muslim-dominated   area in   town on March 17 to celebrate the first day of new Vikram Samvat. He was arrested in a dramatic manner near Patna Junction on March 31 night and sent to jail on April 1. 

 Bhagalpur additional district judge (IV) and district judge (in charge) Kumud Ranjan Singh also granted bail to the other eight accused in the case. A Bhagalpur court on March 24 had issued arrest warrant against Arjit, who had unsuccessfully contested 2015 assembly elections on the BJP ticket. Bhagalpur additional chief judicial magistrate Anjani Kumar Srivastava had on April 3 rejected the regular bail petition of Arjit, whose lawyers moved the district judge court for relief.
 
 “It will take a day or two before Arjit and others will come out of jail as we have to produce the bailors before the court for their release,” Arjit’s lawyer Biresh Kumar Mishra told this newspaper on Monday.
