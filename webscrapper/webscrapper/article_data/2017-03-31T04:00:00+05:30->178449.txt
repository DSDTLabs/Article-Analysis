Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) plans to slash rent rates to make it affordable for common people to use Indoor Stadium on whose renovation it spent Rs 20 crore in 2015-16. The stadium built at a cost of Rs 24 crore at Athwa zone and inaugurated in 1998 was in bad shape, thus the municipal authorities went in for its structural strengthening. However, no major sporting event has been held at the stadium since its renovation.

 SMC charges Rs1 lakh as rent plus electricity charges for three and half hour morning session and Rs2 lakh evening session. SMC plans to give 25 per cent discount from Monday to Thursday for four hours. Rent for other days would remain same. The SMC would give 25 per cent discount on all days from February to May. Significantly, sport event organizers can get the stadium at just 10 per cent of these rates. 
 
 “We would submit this proposal for approval before the standing committee this week. Once it is approved, the rates would come into force immediately,” the SMC officer added. tnn
