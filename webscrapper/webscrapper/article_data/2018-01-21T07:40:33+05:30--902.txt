MADURAI: After a period of 25 days, fireworks manufacturers in   have decided to withdraw their indefinite strike, following an overnight meeting with dairy development minister  , who also hails from Sivakasi.

 The meeting which started on Friday evening went on till the wee hours of Saturday with the minister assuring all help on behalf of the government to redress their grievances and to help commence production from Monday.
 
 
 The industry has been on an indefinite strike from December 26 demanding an amendment to Environment Protection Act exempting fireworks from its purview. They also wanted the hearing by   on a petition seeking to ban fireworks as part of curbing air pollution to be heard early. As a result, the small town which contributes over 80% of fireworks production of the country had come to a standstill with local economy taking a heavy hit. With their livelihood hit, thousands of fireworks workers had been eagerly awaiting the commencement of fireworks production.
 
 Under these circumstances, Rajendra Bhalaji met members of All India Federation of Fireworks Associations (AIFFA) in Sivakasi on Friday. During the meeting, the minister assured the fireworks owners that AIADMK MPs in both Houses of Parliament would raise their issue, and assist the owners to meet the central ministers concerned. He also assured that the state assembly would pass a special resolution on the fireworks issue and the state would also file a petition in Supreme Court pleading for speedy disposal of the case regarding fireworks.
