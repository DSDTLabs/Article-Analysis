HYDERABAD: While cops crack down on   and muzzle conduits to stop sale of contraband in city, addicts get their high from click of a mouse.

 In a comment on the portal, one user, Divij, stated that for those who know where to look, it's an open secret that fruit juice vendors, ice-cream carts and pan shops are places to hit for a high, with weed being sold publicly in match-boxes.
 
 In its description for ganjasale points, the website says: “Dhoolpet (or Dhulpet) is the main area for cannabis. It's a mostly slum area, with many dealers in alleys. Police are after your wallet. Ask any local for where to find some ganja (or charas for hash), give them some cash, and they'll show you the way . Other areas to score are Dilsukhnagar, Tolichowki and near YMCA at Secunderabad.“
 
 Another user said: “Sitafalmandi is a good place to score ganja, very safe and affordable (sic).“ City police's cybercrime department officials feigned ignorance about the website. “We will bring it down soon,“ said assistant commissioner of police (ACP),  , Hyderabad police, KCS Raghu Vir.
