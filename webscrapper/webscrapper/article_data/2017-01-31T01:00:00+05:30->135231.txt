There have been rumours about this for a while, but now, it is official —   and his wife   are ending their 18-year marriage after living separately for a couple of years. The singer-composer, who always refrained from talking about his personal life, issued a media statement, which read, “After several years of living separately, Priyali and I are officially filing for divorce. This is the only statement either of us wishes to make, as this is a private and personal matter, and we hope it will be respected as such. Over our time apart, we have become perhaps greater friends than we have ever been before. Both our families are extremely close, to us and to each other, and of course, this will remain so. Our private lives have always been extremely personal to us, so we humbly ask for dignity and privacy in this regard. Thank you.”
Whe we contacted Vishal, he said, “I haven’t spoken to anyone on this, nor will I. I have issued a statement and there is nothing else to say... no more, no less.”
