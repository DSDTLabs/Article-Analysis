Chennai:Hyper-local delivery startup Genie on Monday announced that it would cease operations due to insufficiency of funds and lack of investor interest.

 In a Facebook post, the founders announced the decision to close down operations. “Genie will be delivering its last delight on March 31,” they said.
 
 Founded by Sreekesh Krishnan, Rakesh Mani, Parth Shah in 2015, the Chennai-based Genie started off as an on-demand delivery platform for consumers. The founders also launched Genie for Business to look after on demand, bulk and scheduled orders for restaurants, home bakers and any other business that needed assistance with deliveries. 
 
 The startup banked on exclusive tie-ups with restaurants and charged convenience fee for deliveries. In October 2015, they bagged funding from Wayne Burt Group, a Singapore-based group that invests in oil and gas, aerospace and petrochemicals.
 
 The founders said, “We've been trying very hard to raise a round of funding to sustain operations and for growth. Over time, we courted a lot of investors who made a lot of promises, but none of them materialised. Even though everyone liked the business and loved the team, they were skeptical because of a few big shutdowns in the sector.”
 
 Genie is one among many to bite the dust in the area of hyper local delivery. During 2014 several startups raised funds and in a bid to offer instant satisfaction to customers, many doled out discounts and offers, buring cash to acquire customers. While Sequoia and SAIF backed Peppertap shut down its online grocery business to focus on logistics, Grofers rolled back operations in nine cities and others like LocalBanya, GrocShop and MovinCart simply pulled the plug on their business. 
 
 Despite Genie steering clear off the discount model, the tepid response from investors is an indicator that hyper-local is a space that investors are still being wary about.
