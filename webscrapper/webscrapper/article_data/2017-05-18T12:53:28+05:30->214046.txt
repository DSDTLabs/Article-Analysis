Raman is in his room since he has an eye infection and is waiting for the boy gang to come up for the cocktail party. He calls up   who doesn't pick up his phone, he then calls   and Mani only to know that their phones are switched off.
 
  
 
  
 
  
  On the other hand, Aaliya tastes the gulab jamun made by   for her and she appreciates him. Adi also wants to try them but she stops him and tells him that she loved the effort he took for her.
  
  Raman gets angry realising Ishita's plan and rushes downstairs and shouts at Ishita calling her bossy and ruining their party.   gets angry at seeing Raman and asks him to leave since he has conjunctivitis. He slams his hankerchief on the table and leaves. Ishita also scolds him for this as anyone can catch infection.
  
  On hearing arguments, Adi and Aaliya go downstairs Adi sneezes and tries to wipe his face with Aaliyaâ€™s sari but Shagun stops him. Adi then picks up Raman's hankerchief which Ishita takes away from him.
  
  A drunk Adi wakes up his mother Ishita, who is sleeping on the sofa, tells her that he wants to make a confession about something that he has done. He fails to tell her anything and says he just wants to sleep in her lap.
  
  Next morning, Ishita tries to talk to Raman but he doesn't listen and leaves the room pretending to be busy over a call.
  
  Ruhi, Adi and Aaliya give Ishita a Mother's Day surprise by cutting cake.
