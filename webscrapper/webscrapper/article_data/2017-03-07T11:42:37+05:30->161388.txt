Be it her role as the quiet but headstrong   in ‘Parineeta’, her turn as the bold actress in ‘The Dirty Picture’ or the pregnant woman in search of her missing husband in ‘Kahaani’,   has time and again delivered power-packed performances. Now, the actress is back to set the screen ablaze with her next project, ‘Begum Jaan’. One look at the first poster of ‘Begum Jaan’ and you know you don’t want to mess with Vidya.

 In the poster, the actress can be seen sitting on chair with dishevelled hair, holding a hookah pipe in her hand. Dressed in a maroon lehenga and an embroidered blouse, Vidya looks menacing as the madam of the brothel. What catches your attention is the uni-brow she is sporting and those vicious grey eyes. The poster’s tagline reads, “My Body, My House, My Country, My Rules”. Vidya took to Twitter to share an image of the poster and captioned it, “Aa rahi hoon main! #BegumJaanFirstLook @visheshfilms @srijitspeaketh”.
  
  ‘Begum Jaan’ is the Hindi adaptation of National Award-winning filmmaker Srijit Mukherji’s Bengali film, ‘Rajkahini’. The film delves into the lives of 11 women living in a brothel that finds itself divided by the newly-chalked LOC, with half of the house in India and the other half in Pakistan post-partition. ‘Begum Jaan’ is slated to release on April 14.
