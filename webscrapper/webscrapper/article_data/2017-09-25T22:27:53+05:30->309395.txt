ROORKEE: Piran Kaliyar police on Monday arrested two members of a gang that would block roads at night in interior places and rob people at gunpoint.   The gang was operating since the last one month and would pose as beggars on tricycle around Piran Kaliyar shrine in the day time.    Reports said that the gang would set up traps at night using ropes on interior routes in Dhanauri area. They would tie a rope across the road with trees or poles and as bikers or people on cycles stumble on it, the gang would rob them at gunpoint.    The arrested have been identified as Iliyas Salim and Yunus Yamin, both residents of Mehmudpur village in Piran Kaliyar.    “Two such incidents were reported and on a tip off we nabbed two accused from Kota Muradnagar link road, another escaped. They confessed to the crime and we have recovered two country-made pistols one each from them,” said Swapan Kishore Singh, circle officer, Roorkee.    The accused told the police that they were carrying out the crime since a month otherwise they would beg near Piran Kaliyar shrine during the morning hours.
