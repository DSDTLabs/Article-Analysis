 Though political parties did not contest election on party symbols but managers of political parties, who kept a close watch on the poll, started exploring the interest of winning candidates in supporting them to install candidate of their choice as chairperson. 
 
 The polling, however, went off peacefully with the around 68.6% voters exercising their franchise. The voting started around 8am in all the 100 polling booths for all wards amid heavy security in place. The voting percentage remained below 40% by afternoon but it paced up post noon with people reaching booths in large numbers. 
 
 The administration said they had deputed 16 patrolling parties and six deputy superintendents of police with personnel under their command to keep a strict vigil on the whole process.
