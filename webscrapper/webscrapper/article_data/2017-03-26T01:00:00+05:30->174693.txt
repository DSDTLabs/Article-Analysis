Madhusudhan, who was seen in a crucial role in Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Maanagaram, is elated that his character and the film have received appreciation from all quarters. The actor says that he has been approached by filmmakers mostly for villain roles after his menacing act in   was much raved about by critics and the audience. 

 “I wanted to bring in some changes to the characters I play,” he says, adding, “I have been offered negative roles not only in Tamil, but Telugu and Kannada, too. I don’t mind taking them up, but I look for some difference in them. The role I took up in Santhanam’s Odi Odi Uzhaikkanum is one such character. I will be seen essaying the role of an ACP — a serious guy who troubles Santhanam’s character. But it has a tinge of comedy which I loved. I have a few more days of shooting left. I will join the team from the first week of April” 
 
 Madhusudhan, who is currently working in a Kannada film starring Darshan in the lead, has a Tamil film with Vishal and a Telugu film with Naga Chaitanya. He was also a part of films like   2 and Arya-starrer Kadamban which are slated to hit the screens next month.
