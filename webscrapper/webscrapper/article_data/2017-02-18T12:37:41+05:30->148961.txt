 “Salem MLAs should not support Palaniswami as he is unfit to function as chief minister,” said S K Selvam, former MLA of Veerapandi constituency. He also urged the MLAs to support   for a transparent government, saying the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had hand-picked him for the top job.
 
 If the MLAs support Palaniswami in the floor test, the protesters said they would be considered corrupt and won’t be allowed to enter their constituencies. “We received information that party general secretary V K Sasikala and her family members have offered them money to support Palaniswami,” M K Selvaraj said.
