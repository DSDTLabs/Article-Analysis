PUNE: Collectors of all districts have been appointed the controlling officer and implementing authority of the Right to Services (RTS) Act. A recommendation to this effect was made by  , the   commissioner, and was approved by the state government a week ago.

 The   Act, 2015, aims to deliver transparent, efficient and timely public services to ensure good governance.
 
  
 Kshatriya said all the collectors have been made the controlling officers for better implementation of the Act. The collector will also hold a review meeting every month. “The order was cleared a week back. Accountability has been laid on the collector. It will be easier to keep tabs on every district,” said Kshatriya. The collectors too have demanded a dashboard or an online monitoring system that will help them monitor applications and redressal by every department, he added.
 
 Though the Act was approved by the state government in 2015, the RTS commissioner was appointed only last year in March. He has already notified 462 services from 25 departments. A suggestion to bring all the services, whether notified or unnotified, under the ambit of the RTS Act has been forwarded as well. 
 
 The RTS commission has also decided to penalise errant officials after seeking a detailed report from the secretary of the respective department. The reason for the delay in service delivery and whether it was done arbitrarily or for a justified reason would be assessed before appropriate action is taken, assured the commissioner.
 
 While chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has been insisting on online applications through the RTS app or the government’s Aaple Sarkar portal, technical issues have not completely been removed. “There are issues of poor connectivity, poor server speeds and problems with uploading documents. These issues are being addressed and we are open to offline applications too,” Kshatriya said.
