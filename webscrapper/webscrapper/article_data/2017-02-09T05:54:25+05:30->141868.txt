MUMBAI: That time after   but before a   break, when attention wanes and the office turns into an unbearably dreary place, is when the bored lot in the city think about a vacation. 

 A study by an online   portal found that it is between 3.30 pm and 4.30 pm that most of their customers from the city book a holiday.
 
 Elsewhere, except for Kolkata, the most popular time to make search queries for a holiday is between 12.30 pm and 1.30 pm. The 3.30 pm to 4.30 pm slot was also the second-most preferred timing for the rest of the country to make travel plans and book tickets, said the study on travel trends observed in 2016.
 
 The popular weekday to go on a holiday in the country was Friday. “After Friday, Saturday was second choice as popular day to take off on a holiday,” the study by Kayak said. 
 
 When it came to holiday duration, the most popular choice was seven days. “Travellers from Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Hyderabad displayed a longer average trip duration, compared to Pune and Jaipur. The average travel duration for Ahmedabad was 11 days, followed by Mumbai and Hyderabad with eight days,” the study said.
