KOLHAPUR: The hotel owners organisation in the city, pitching in favour of  , said that it acts as an additional income for   as the total money collected gets distributed among them.

 The government of India, recently, made it voluntary for the citizens to pay service charge incurred on their hotel bills. There are two types of charges service tax that is mandatory and service charge, which ranges from 2 to 20% depending on the hotels. 
 
 The president of Kolhapur district hotel owners association,  , said, “There are very few hotels in Kolhapur which add service charge in their bills. This is generally practised in big hotels. In small restaurants, customers tip on their own. The service charge is in favour of hotel employeesfrom the cleaner to the cook, as it is an additional source of income for them. The money also comes handy for the hotel owners to replace cutleries damaged by the customers.” 
 
 The president of Kolhapur district Grahak Panchayat,  , said, “Service charge is generally found in big hotels. The hotel owners add the component for the sake of their employees. But why do they add service charge when the employees are being paid by the hotel management? There is a scope for suspicion here as no one knows whether the collected money is actually given to the employees. Owners of big restaurants add higher service charge in the bills, which the customer hardly denies.”
 
 A resident of Kolhapur, Vijay Gaikwad said, “I was oblivious to the concept of service charge, but now I know that it is voluntary. I would like pay service charge since the money, according to hotel owners, goes to the waiters and cooks. They work hard to provide the best of their services to us. It is not a big thing to pay an extra amount incurred on the bill. But if we don’t get satisfactory service then we have the right to not pay the charge.”
