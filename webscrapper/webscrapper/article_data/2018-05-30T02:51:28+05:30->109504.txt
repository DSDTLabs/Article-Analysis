NOIDA: Homebuyers of Lotus   have said they will move the   against 3C Company for delaying the handover of flats to around 3,000  . The buyers’ group, Lotus Panache Flat Buyers’ Association, said it had already filed complaints with the consumer forum and the Economic Offences Wing.

 Located in Sector 110, Lotus Panache has 30 towers with 4,000 apartments. The project was sold between 2009 and 2010 and the delivery was supposed to be completed by 2012. One thousand flats were handed over in 2012, while the remaining are yet to be delivered.
 
 “We have invested all our savings in the flat we booked. For the last so many years, we have not received any response from the builder. It has been eight years since we paid up for the flat,” said  , a senior citizen and flat buyer at Panache.
 
 “We have organised protests in front of the houses of each of the three directors of the company. We have also filed an FIR earlier this year under sections 420 and 406. We have met the builders several times and have been told that funds are being organised,” said Sushil Kumar, general secretary of the association.
 
 Repeated calls made to the developer went unanswered.
