New Delhi: The ever-increasing workload of Indian bowlers and the need to monitor their training sessions has led to a surge in demand for throwdown specialists in the   ( ). Delivering   in the nets at batsman has become a highly specialized job, like those of trainers and video analysts.

 
 
 Unlike a Ranji Trophy team of 15 where the coaching staff has to manage just seven to eight batsmen, IPL teams have 25 member squads. To ensure these players get enough practice, especially lower middle-order batsmen and tailenders, IPL teams are engaging throwdown specialists because teams generally run out of bowling options in the nets.
 
 India’s bowling coach Bharat Arun says throwdown specialists are in high demand. Witness the 30-year-old throwdown specialist Raghavindraa, or ‘Raghu’, who travels with Team India and is renowned for his sidearm throws at speeds close to 150kph. “It gives the batting coach all angles to study the batsmen. It is undoubtedly a tough job and you can last more than 10 years. This (job) is certainly one for the future,” Arun said. ‘Raghu’ delivers sidearm throws at the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for hours at an end, providing valuable training.
 
 Those who choose to become throwdown specialists can earn good money too at the professional level. There are only around 10 throwdown specialists in the country right now, but their tribe is growing. Delhi Daredevils, for example, have just employed a throwdown specialist from Chennai who been throwing the white ball at Delhi’s cricketers for three hours non-stop at every training session.
 
 At the same time, he is travelling and staying with the team besides earning a minimum of Rs 50,000 per month.
