KOLKATA: Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) was buzzing with activity till late on Saturday, the last day of financial year 2017-18.

 Barely five minutes before the clock struck 11, a gleaming new electric locomotive chugged out from the siding of the country’s premier rail locomotive manufacturer. The locomotive, the 350th to be built by CLW in 2017-18, was flagged off by Ghanshyam Singh, member (traction),  , in the presence of CLW general manager V P Pathak.
 
 Minutes before this, Singh had flagged off a locomotive that rolled out from CLW’s Dankuni unit, the last one for the year. In 2016-17, CLW had built 292 locomotives and was set a target of 350 by the   Board for 2017-18.
 
 “Never have 350 electric locomotives been manufactured in a single year in the country. With the thrust towards electrification,   will require more electric locomotives. This will lead to savings in fuel costs. At the same time, we will have to design, develop and manufacture more advanced electric locomotives. CLW is all set to manufacture 9,000 HP locomotives, capable of hauling trains at 200kmph, in the near future,” an official said.
 
 CLW was established on January 26, 1950 and tasked with the production of steam locomotives. By 1956, 3,000 Volt DC locomotives were introduced and in 1957, a decision was taken to adopt a 25 kV AC traction. The Burdwan-Mughalsarai stretch through the grand chord was electrified first.
 
 During Saturday’s ceremony, Singh appreciated the efforts of staff and officers at the CLW main unit and its Dankuni ancillary. 
 
 “The year 2017-18 ushered in a new era in electric locomotive production. CLW was tasked with not only achieving an all-time high production target of 325 locos but also advised to assist in production of 25 locos at Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW)/ Varanasi and two others at   (DMW)/Patiala,” another official said.
