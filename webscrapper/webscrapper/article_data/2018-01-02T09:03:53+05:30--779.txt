JAIPUR: Traffic chaos and congestion was rampant at city roads on the first day of 2018 on Monday when Jaipurities from all walks of life thronged city temples. Temples in the   already known as ‘Choti Kashi’ were flooded with devotees in the morning and evening hours and at several places traffic hallabaloo became a major problem for people passing through the roads near the city temples. 

 Traffic on the roads connecting Moti Dungari Ganesh temple,   temple, Tadkeshwar Mahadev and Jharkhand Mahadev temple was chaotic since early morning. At some of the roads policemen from nearby police station while at some places the traffic policemen were trying their level best to make the traffic smooth, however at many places the deployment was less. 
 
 “It was an expected rush as many people in pink city start their New Year with lots of worships and Poojas. We have had enough number of morning staff for management of smooth traffic. However, our men were already over stressed while managing traffic on the city roads from New Years’ eve to early morning on the New Year on Monday,” said a senior officer of Jaipur police Commissionerate.
 
 Places including Chaura Raasta and Queen’s road were chaotic as a large number of devotees gathered at the Taadkeshwar Mahadev and Jharkhand Mahadev temples. “Monday is considered as the day to worship Lord Shiva also known as Mahadev and it was a coincidence that the New Year was starting with a Monday,” said  , an astrologer and a priest at a temple in the city.
