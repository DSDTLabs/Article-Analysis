Ahmedabad: Just how many   suffered from chikungunya in 2016? Last year, the   ( ), which gathers data from more than 150 hospitals, had claimed that just 328 people suffered from chikungunya in the entire year. 

  However, a recent study conducted by just one pathology testing institute in Ahmedabad, has reported 278 confirmed cases of chikungunya between July and December alone. The institute used laboratory based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to confirm these cases. This particular institute attended to 757 patients who had approached it for tests between July and December.
 
 The research was conducted by the department of molecular genetics at SMR Laboratory and mentored by former director, school of sciences, Gujarat University, MV Rao. 
 
 The SMR Laboratory team included Parth Shah, Nidhi Shah, Ayushi Patel, Siddhi Kurtadikar, Khusbhu Patel, Shiva Murarka, Bhavini Shah. The study was published in the   recently. 
 
 The study found that during the post-monsoon season — i.e., October, November and December — the maximum number of suspected cases turned out to be positive. This comes to almost 35.2% of suspected cases. 
 
 The study claims that the maximum number of   occurred among people aged between 51 years or above and also in the 21 to 40 years age category. Of the total number of people affected, nearly 18% belonged to the 41-50 age group.
 
 The study concludes that older people are more likely to contract chikungunya than the young. “Back in 2006, the chikungunya outrbreak was accompanied by dengue which made the onslaught of the disease even more lethal,” said a senior AMC official.
