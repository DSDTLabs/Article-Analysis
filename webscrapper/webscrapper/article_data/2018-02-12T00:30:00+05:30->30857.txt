Bengaluru: A Yemeni man, who lost eyesight during a bomb explosion in the country’s capital Sana’a three months ago, has regained partial vision, thanks to a team of doctors here.

 Sameer Abdo, 24, who underwent surgery recently at Dr Agarwal Eye Hospital in Bengaluru, has regained up to 85% vision in his right eye. 
 
 Speaking about his road to recovery, the engineering student said, “I am thrilled to be able to see and move freely without anyone’s help and get back to normal life. I can read books and even ride a motorbike on my own,” said Abdo.
 
 Dr Ravi Dorairaj, medical director of the hospital, said Abdo underwent complicated multiple surgeries. “His right eye was damaged with multiple foreign particles in the cornea. On diagnosis, we found he was suffering from traumatic cataract and vitreous hemorrhage, resulting in bleeding inside the eye,” he said.
 
 However, the doctors couldn’t do much to Abdo’s left eye, which was badly damaged during the blast. “We have done only a cosmetic correction,” Dr Dorairaj added.
