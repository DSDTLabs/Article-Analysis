MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Friday recalled its order issuing contempt of court notice to a senior bureaucrat after the state government assured it would set up separate disaster management authorities for Mumbai and its suburbs within a fortnight. 

  Peeved the government had set up only one authority for both districts, a bench of justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla had, in the morning session, issued contempt notice to additional chief secretary Medha Gadgil, in charge of  , for "wilful breach" of the court's order.
 
 The court was hearing a public interest litigation on implementation of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 following the drought situation faced in several villages. It had earlier directed that the authorities be constituted by July 31.
 
 The judges remarked the government's stand that only one authority was enough for two districts was "disastrous". "The Act is crystal clear. It is the state government's obligation to establish a   for each and every district," they added.
 
 In the afternoon session, the state pleader submitted a letter stating the government would constitute separate authorities for both districts within 15 days. The judges relented and recalled their order issued earlier in the day. Posting the next hearing for May 4, they cautioned that if the authorities were not constituted "it will be a case of aggravated contempt."
