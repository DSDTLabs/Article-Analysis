HYDERABAD:   at   ( ) continues to be under threat, with the university authorities and forest department officials unable to reach a consensus on protective measures to be taken on campus. With status quo persisting, the sprawling green campus has become a haven for poachers.

 For the fourth time in the last two weeks, a spotted   was found dead at the varsity. The deer, with both its antlers broken, was found at the   office gate adjoining the campus on Monday. A veterinary doctor was immediately called for by a team of wildlife enthusiasts, but the deer could not be saved. Last year, 33 deer deaths were registered inside the campus. 
 
 Despite repeated discussions, the forest department and the university authorities have not come to a consensus on resolving the issue. “During our last meeting, we had asked the university to hand over the land to us as wildlife is government property. The university vice-chancellor refused to do so and asked us to provide protection to the wildlife instead,” said A Shankaran, senior forest department official, adding that another round of meeting is expected to happen in the next few days.
 
 When TOI contacted the varsity officials, they claimed it is not possible for the security staff to protect the wildlife as the campus is huge. “There are various entry points to the campus and it is impossible for us to secure all the areas. However, we have done everything within our capacity to secure the wildlife on campus. There is nothing more we can possibly do,” said T V Rao, chief security officer at the varsity. 
 
 Students have now taken it upon themselves to do their bit for the fauna. “We are patrolling the campus to find poachers. So far, we have nabbed over 88 trespassers. But no action was taken against them,” said Ravi Jillapalli, founder of Wild Lens, a protection group active in the university.
