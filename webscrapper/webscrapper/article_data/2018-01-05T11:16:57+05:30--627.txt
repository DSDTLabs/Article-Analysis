BENGALURU: All 198 wards in the city will have at least one Indira   by January 26, the   (BBMP) has promised. Since August 15 last year, the civic agency has been launching the canteens, which offers quality food at subsidized costs, in a staggered manner. Currently, 157 canteens are operational across the city.

 Apart from lack of planning, one major hurdle the corporation has been facing is paucity of land. It has faced flak for building canteens in parks, on play- grounds and near temples. To overcome the problem, 24 of the new canteens will be mobile units.
 
 “Of the 24 mobile canteens, three will be in east zone, six in west, 10 in south zone, one in  , three in   and one in  ,” Manoj  , special commissioner, told TOI. “The remaining permanent canteens will also be inaugurated.”
 
 These mobile canteens will stock up on food and water at assembly kitchens and head to designated parking spots in their respective wards. They will then return to the kitchen to drop off the used plates and refuel. Their meal timings and menu will be similar to that of the permanent canteens. The mobile units will also be run by the two companies currently operating the fixed canteens.
 
 “Each van will have a staff of five,” Rajan said. “It will be equipped with four CCTV cameras, a GPS tracking device, and six foldable tables which will be set up around it once it starts serving food. Behind the van, there will be two sinks where people can wash their hands. The van has a capacity of 400 litres of washing water (for hands) and 200 litres of drinking water. The dirty water will be collected in a sump at the base of the vehicle.”
