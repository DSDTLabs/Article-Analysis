Tirunelveli: A 39-year-old man was arrested by the Tirunelveli district police for murdering his 65-year-old mother after she refused to give him money to buy liquor. According to police, preliminary inquiry revealed that the accused S Gomathi Nayagam was furious with his mother S Subbulakshmi and crushed her head with a grinder stone late on Wednesday night.

 Police said the family hailing from Ayikudi village had moved to a rented house in Veeravanallur only a month ago. They were working in snack making units. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Nayagam was addicted to alcohol and also used ganja. The mother and son often quarrelled over his addiction.
 
 According to the police, the accused told them that he came to know that his mother had Rs 7,350 and he asked her money to buy liquor. But she refused, following which there was a wordy altercation. In the melee, he attacked her and smashed her head with the grinder stone, leaving her dead on the spot. Not knowing what to do, Nayagam was roaming about the locality when neighbours alerted the Veeravanallur police. The man was booked under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code and was arrested. TNN
