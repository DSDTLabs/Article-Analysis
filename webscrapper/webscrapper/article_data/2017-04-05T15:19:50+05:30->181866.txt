 is a name that is now popular across the country and of course a few parts of the world. For just one 'Baahubali', the director was catapulted to international fame.

 Rajamouli is now on his toes promoting the film, '
 ' across the country and was questioned about his Bollywood debut at one such event. Though the director had been approached with offers to direct 
  earlier, he denied them and was keen on his plan to explore the industry with his trade mark film. 
 
 Now that 'Baahubali' and its sequel gained him recognition for his work, the filmmaker is at ease to explore the opportunity. At Delhi recently, when the director was interacting with press and media, he revealed that he has been working on a script for a while now and will be making Hindi debut very soon. Though we are unsure of the script that he is working on is what is on the director's mind for making Bollywood debut, he is sure going to make things better for 
  and 
  with his ideas and films.
 
 At this point, it is worth mentioning that Rajamouli's father, K V Vijayendra Prasad, who wrote the story of 'Baahubali' and its sequel also provided subject matter to Salman Khan starrer -'Bhajrangi Bhaijaan' apart many other terrific films that won critical acclaim. He is also penning story for Kollywood actor Vijay's 61st outing which is titled tentatively 'Vijay 61'. Let us hope that   will come out with laurels in Bollywood and pushes the capability of Tollywood technicians to a next level.
 
 Baahubali: The Conclusion is slated to open in theatres on April 28 worldwide.
