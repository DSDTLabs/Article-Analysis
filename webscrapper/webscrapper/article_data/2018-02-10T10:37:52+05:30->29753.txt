CHANDIGARH: Punjab forest department is planning to take disciplinary action against the   (IFS) officer   for allegedly regularizing around 40 daily wage employees in an illegal manner. 

 Forest minister   told TOI, "We are examining the matter legally and thereafter disciplinary action would be taken against Harsh Kumar for violation of rules in regularization of daily wagers." 
 
 The minister said as soon as the department came to know about some irregularities committed by the officer, he was transferred from the post of chief conservator of forests (hills) to chief conservator of forests (IT) on January 30. After finding "stark irregularities" in some cases out of the total 40 regularized employees during Kumar's tenure as conservator of forests (research and training), the department has dismissed those employees. It was found though the previous SAD-BJP government had passed an Act not to regularize daily wage employees beyond 58 years but some employees of even over 65 years of age were regularized. It had also come to the notice of the department that some of the Group C appointments were not made through transparent process.
 
 IFS officer Kumar did not answer calls made by the TOI.
 
 The trigger for the transfer of Harsh Kumar on January 30 on chief minister's orders was that he had issued certain orders to various project developers in areas of Mohali about the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) notification and thus creating confusion. 
 
 He had moved the Central Administrative Tribunal against the transfer order. The state government had on February 2 issued fresh notification extending the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) in 15 villages of kandi area in Mohali district on the basis of a study report by various agencies stating this was 'severe soil erosion' area.
