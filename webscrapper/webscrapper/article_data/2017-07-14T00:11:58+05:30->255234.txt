Kolhapur: Nine hundred and thirty four schools out of a total 2,002 have been converted into   schools so far, as the new revised deadline of August 15 approaches.

 The district primary education department’s project of turning all schools digital is facing various obstacles. According to the department, unavailability of funds is playing spoilsport and might result in delay in the project.
 
 Subhash Chougule, district primary education officer, told TOI, “We had an early May deadline this year to achieve a target of turning 2,002 schools into digital schools. To achieve it, we needed strong public participation. However many schools have remained behind because the financial requirement has not been met.”
 
 He added, “At present 934 schools out of 2,002 have been turned into digital schools. The 934 schools have the required software and hardware to be termed as digitally equipped schools.”
 
 When asked about the revised deadline Chougule said “By August 15 we might as well achieve more than 70% of the target. However for 100%, we might have to wait till the end of the year.”
 
 He said that reaching out to industries in the region for contribution in achieving the digital school project is being done along with the support from non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
 
 Earlier in April, Kunal Khemnar, chief executive officer (CEO), Kolhapur zila parishad (ZP) in a public program had said that, gram panchayats adopting the digital mode of learning will be felicitated from Kolhapur ZP.
 
 He had said, “With the changing times, we too need to change and adapt to the positive things that can alter our lives. For these changes the society, gram panchayats and teachers need to show active participation to encourage digital way of learning.
 
 The state government’s school education and sports department had said that it will take assistance from the Rotary South Asian Society (RSAS) for making over 18,000 government and private aided schools digital.
