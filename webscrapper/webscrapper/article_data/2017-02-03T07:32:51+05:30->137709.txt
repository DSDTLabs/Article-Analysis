CHENNAI:   working president M K Stalin on Thursday accused ministers and   MLAs of ruining the democratic principles in the House and making adulatory references to a non-member and AIADMK general secretary  .

 In a letter to cadres, the DMK leader alleged that speaker P Dhanapal behaved in an autocratic manner and did not give adequate opportunity to the opposition, but allowed the treasury benches to criticise DMK leadership and opposition with impunity. The rights of the opposition were denied, he said. “The speaker, who has an authority to regulate the proceedings, acted as ‘one-sided umpire’. Chief minister  , also the leader of the House, looked like facing a sort of crisis and stayed indifferent,” Stalin said. DMK walked out of the assembly on Wednesday, after the speaker announced the name of Congress leader K R Ramasamy as head of the assembly public accounts committee.
