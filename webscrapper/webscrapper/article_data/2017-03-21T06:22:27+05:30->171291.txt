THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Senior leader   has sent legal notices to chief minister  , chief secretary S M Vijayanand and state police chief   warning them of legal actions, including initiating proceedings for contempt of court, if the government does not close down bar hotels and beer and wine parlours within 500 m along highways, by March 31.

 Sudheeran, who issued the notice through senior counsel in the high court  , said that a reading of court order clearly shows that court wants to prevent the vending of liquor anywhere near or facing the national or state highways. “It does not make any distinction between bar hotels, including beer and wine parlours, on one hand and retail outlets on the other,” the notice said.
 
 But despite the clear directions in judgment, it appears that few bar hotel owners have played foul in the matter and obtained an erroneous and strange legal advice to the effect that the court judgment does not stand in the way of smooth functioning of bar hotels and beer and wine parlours along the highways. The notice further alleged that the government had colluded with some hoteliers and beer and wine parlours to make undue financial advantage to the hoteliers.
 
 The notice further said that the legal advice of attorney general Mukul Rohatgi should not have been relied on by the state government, especially in the view of the fact that that attorney general had appeared for a bar hotel owner who had challenged the UDF liquor policy in 2015.
 
 The notice also said that the action of giving police protection for shifting the outlets by openly suppressing people’s protest against shifting is highly undemocratic. The state government has issued orders that the judgment will not cover the hotels and restaurants that serve liquor within their premises.
