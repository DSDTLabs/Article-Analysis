LUCKNOW: As one of the most coveted Chairman's Gold Medal dangled from his neck, Amritsar-born Raghav Arora said he aimed to be ‘somebody like Prashant Kishore’, a political strategist. This, he said, all for the betterment of the country. “It was through the history and civics books of Class 6 and 8 that I developed my interested in politics, not as a  , but as a strategist like  ,” he said. 

 Sitting in a classroom for media interaction, Arora, along with his parents, shared his will to publish a novel he wrote in Class 11 and 12. “It is a 190-page collection of chapters that talks about a young boy dealing with hardships, success and tribulations, for that is what stays in people’s mind,” he said. “Maybe he could get it published someday and be the next Chetan Bhagat,” laughed off his father, Ramesh Arora.
 
 Placed at HSBC bank in Bangalore, Arora said he followed the concept of time management that he had picked up from his seniors at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, Delhi University, while pursuing BCom Honours. “The point was to focus on important things before they become urgent. And that is what helped me even here,” he said. “He was always the favourite of his teachers right from college until here at  ,” said his elated mother, Monica Arora. 
 
 His elder sibling, an IIM-Bangalore graduate, inspired him to crack the IIMs. “It is the transformation that one gets in his/her personality after entering the portals of IIM that I looked for at the institute. I have a more serious approach in life now,” he said. Arora is also working on a theoretical concept, analysing the link between 'interactions and intentions’, important in both professional and personal life.
