The government’s flagship   (NMCG) has created sewage treatment capacity of just over 259 million litres per day (MLD), which is about 11% of the 2,311 MLD the programme seeks to create. With sewage treatment capacity being a fraction of what is required, over 1,300 MLD of sewage continues to flow into the main stem of the Ganga. 

 Overall, the Mission has 193 projects including 100 sewage treatment projects on its agenda and has completed 49 projects utilizing 21% of the funds sanctioned for all projects. Till March this year, it had completed 20 of the 100 sewage treatment projects. The cabinet approved the   programme on May 13, 2015 as a comprehensive approach to rejuvenate the Ganga by inclusion of all its tributaries under one umbrella at a total cost of Rs 20,000 crore for five years. 
 
  
  
  
 According to the data available on the Mission website, of the 100 sewage treatment projects, 43 projects are old ones on which work was started before 2015 while the remaining 57 are new initiatives. Of the 43 old projects, 17 have been completed with treatment capacity of 259 MLD. Three of the new projects have been completed, but with related works not being completed these have not added to the capacity as yet. 
 
 The sanctioned cost for sewage infrastructure is about Rs 16,600 cr, making it by far the largest component of the overall programme. Of this, barely Rs 2,814 cr or 17% has been utilized so far. Data presented in the   by the minister of state for water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation shows that according to the  , the total sewage generated from major towns/cities in the catchment of the   is 5,236 MLD, whereas the treatment capacity developed is 3,805 MLD. 
 
 Estimated sewerage generation from 97 towns located on the main stem of the Ganga is 2,953 MLD against the available treatment capacity of 1,584 MLD. Rajiv Kishore, executive director (administration) with the NMCG said that creation of sewage treatment capacity takes 2-2.5 years to finish. NMCG was registered as a society in August, 2011. “After that it took some time to create a set up and posting of people..You can’t expect sewage treatment plants to start functioning within two years. . By this year-end, some projects will start treating sewage” said Kishore.
