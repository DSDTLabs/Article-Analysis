Nagpur: The Bank of India (BOI) has continued its flip-flop on refunding Rs32 lakh to   in connection with the ‘cheque scam’. After NU officially severed all ties with the bank, the BOI head office in Mumbai has directed its city office to refund the amount.

 “They’ve conveyed to us that they would be refunding the amount as per our terms and conditions. But it’s also a tedious procedure, as they’re sending various forms and we’re consulting our legal counsel every time before filling them up,” NU registrar Puran Meshram told TOI.
 
 He added that BOI was going out of its way to refund the amount, apprehending that they would lose a big client like NU, which maintains many accounts and transactions. “As per rules, they can’t refund it since investigations are still underway and the culprits are at large. We’ve over Rs130 crore in fixed deposits in BOI. Moreover, we pay salaries of all our employees through savings account in that bank,” said Meshram.
 
 On March 20, NU had broken the three-decade-old relationship with BOI following its failure to refund the money. The amount had been siphoned off from NU’s general account by fraudsters using fake cheques last year. The account was usually used to receive fees collected from students.
 
 Meanwhile, Meshram said NU will celebrate the 126th birth anniversary of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar on Friday at 3pm at its Convocation Hall. Senior journalist from electronic media Punya Prasun Bajpayee, who started his career from the city, would be the chief guest. VC SP Kane would be present.
