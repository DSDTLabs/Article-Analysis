BENGALURU: On average, two persons died in road accidents every day last year in Bengaluru, which saw 7,506 accidents, a 55.4% jump from 4,828 in 2015. The number of accidents in 2015 had actually dipped from 5,004 in 2014.

 According to data obtained from the  , the number of road deaths in the city in 2016 were 793 (two every day), while the same was 740 in 2015 and 737 in 2014 — not a major rise — indicating that the average deaths caused per accident have drastically reduced in 2016.
 
 But 2016 saw the highest number of deaths in six years, from 2011, while 2010 had seen more deaths (858). Experts attribute the rise in the number of accidents to bad condition of roads and infrastructure.
 
 Data with TOI reveals that 7,506 accidents left 4,193 people injured in 2016, but no classification based on the nature of injuries was being maintained by the police.
 
 “I don’t know if we can attribute these accidents to one or two reasons as the data has just come in and there needs to be a proper study before we blame anything. From the data, we are able to say that roads leading to the city’s outskirts, where facilities for pedestrians are few and motorists drive at high speeds, especially during the night, have reported more cases,” said the additional commissioner of police (traffic).
 
 He said that more people were now filing complaints and not opting for out-of-court settlements, which is another reason for the rise in the numbers. The officer, however, could not immediately say what percentage of the increase could be attributed to this reason.
 
 Blaming three main reasons for road accidents, traffic expert MN Sreehari said, “The first is negligence of drivers, while poor road conditions and weather are the other two.”
 
 “Traffic does not allow one to speed too much, which thereby reduces chances of high-impact accidents. Most accidents happen when drivers speed and lose control on their vehicles, especially on   or expressways,” Sreehari said.
