PATNA: The   of judge   in   on Friday allowed the central investigating agency to take former RJD MP Mohammad   on eight-day remand to interrogate him in Siwan journalist   murder case.
 
  It is for the first time that Shahabuddin, an accused in more than 40 cases, would be quizzed by any central investigating agency. Shahabuddin has been in   since February 19 on the Supreme Court’s order. The CBI court on May 22 had issued production warrant against him in the Rajdeo murder case following which he was produced before it through videoconferencing on Friday. He was not only taken into judicial custody in the journalist murder case, but the court also allowed the CBI to take him on remand in the case, CBI special public prosecutor Akhtar Hussain Khan said.
  
  Rajdeo was shot near a fruit market under the Town police station area in Siwan while he was on his way back to his residence on May 13 last year. After he fell down from his bike, the assailants shot him point blank in his forehead to ensure his death. It is alleged that he was killed for writing against Shahabuddin.
  
  CBI sources said a special team, which was in Bihar for court proceedings at Muzaffarpur, left for New Delhi after procuring the court papers regarding police custody of Shahabuddin.
  
  “CBI will take Shahabuddin into custody on Monday. He will be interrogated till June 6. He is accused number 10 in the Rajdeo murder case. Seven others, including Laddan Miyan alias Azharuddin Beg, are in jail while two accused were granted bail by the special court,” said a top CBI official preferring anonymity. He said after Shahabuddin’s interrogation, the CBI would file the final chargesheet in the case.
  
  “Shahabuddin is the most important one among the ten accused in the journalist murder case,” he said.
