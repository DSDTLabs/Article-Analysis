GREATER NOIDA: Small heaps of dry grass and hay strewn over the parking lot of the Auto Expo were yet to be cleared on Saturday, even after a fire there damaged four cars of visitors.

 The fire in the parking lot on Friday had given rise to two theories â€” a lit cigarette stub thrown by someone that set fire to the dry grass and hay lying there or a short circuit in the engine of a car caused by a battery overload.
 
 Officials, however, insisted that an excavator had been pressed into service in the morning to remove the dry grass. One huge fire tender was seen near the parking lot. The visitors expressed doubt if the tender could at all move into the narrow lanes of the parking lot in case of an emergency.
 
 Meanwhile, many visitors travelling in the shuttle service provided by the organisers complained about   and theft of mobile phones inside the bus. SP (rural) Suniti said a number of policemen had been deployed in the parking lot and the ticket counter.
