AGARTALA: Joining in the mega celebrations marking four years of the   government,   chief minister   on Sunday launched a fortnight-long celebratory programme. 

 "Since the Modi-led government came to power, an engine of development has been surging across the country," Deb said. 
 
 "The series of reforms introduced by the government have brought meaningful change in the growth and development of every sector," he added.
 
 The state unit of BJP will hold a series of programmes across Tripura over the next two weeks. 
 
 Deb said Tripura has seen a huge transformation since the implementation of programmes like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjwala Yojana, Prime Minister   and Ayushman Bharat, and measures like demonetisation and introduction of the GST regime.
 
  "Tripura received a sum of Rs 7,269 crore only under eight departments in the last four years ... After the formation of new government in Tripura in March, the Prime Minister has sanctioned Rs 300 crore as special assistance and another Rs 500 crore is in the pipeline," he added.
 
 In keeping with the "saaf niyat saaf vikaas" slogan that BJP has adopted, Deb said, "There was no allegation of scam or nepotism in the country in four years."
