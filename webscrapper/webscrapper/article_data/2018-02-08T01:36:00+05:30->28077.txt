Chennai: The city police pulled off a major coup early on Wednesday, arresting 76 gangsters, including an underworld leader linked to extortion, abduction-for-ransom rackets and at least three murders, several sub-bosses and henchmen, from a birthday party for the boss at a truck stop off Outer Ring Road near Mangadu, officers said.

 In a 15-hour overnight operation, 12 officers and 50 policemen swooped down in teams on the spot near Malayambakkam village, some swimming or rafting across Chembarambakkam Lake, others surrounding the location, on a tip from a close associate of gang leader P Binu, 45. Around 200 men who face criminal cases in the city had gathered at Velu Lorry Shed, cheering and lighting fireworks as Binu cut his cake with a chopper, an investigating officer said. They fled in all directions, many in just bermudas and T-shirts, when policemen barged in at 12.35am. “The teams held 40 men at gunpoint and, over nine hours, detained 60 others from various places nearby during ‘Operation Birthday’,” the officer said. “A court sent 76 of the men, including Binu, to jail. We let off the others.” Police impounded four cars and 45 motorcycles and seized sickles and swords from the arrested men.
