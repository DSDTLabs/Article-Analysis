CHANDIGARH: Haryana achieved a sex ratio of 900 girls as against 1,000 boys in 2016, chief minister   said on Thursday, citing   (CRS) data.

 This is much in contrast to the statistics of 2011 when Haryana had the worst sex ratio of 834:1000 among all states in the country, he said.
 
 The state government had been making concerted efforts to improve the sex ratio and now it has taken a leap forward by achieving marked improvement in the   (SRB), he claimed.
 
 According to statistics available, the chief minister said out of 5,25,278 children born in the state from January to December 2016, there were 2,76,414 boys and 2,48,864 girls and the sex ratio at birth touched the mark of 900.
 
 He added that none of the districts was below 850 mark and 12 districts in the state had recorded sex ratio of 900 or 900 plus in 2016.
 
 As many as 15 districts had SRB of more than 900 during December 2016.
 
 The CM added the state had launched a massive drive against sex selection, selective abortion and female foeticide.
 
 About 400 FIRs were registered under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal   and the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Acts against offenders after successful raids, including 75 raids conducted across the border in adjoining states in the last about one year, he said.
