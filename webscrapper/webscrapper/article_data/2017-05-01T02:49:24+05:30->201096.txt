GURUGRAM: A day after a few parents met BJP youth leader Manish Yadav, seeking his intervention in the   by schools, another group of parents on Sunday took out a candle-light march to protest against“hooliganism” by private schools, and “inaction” by authorities. 

 Parents, whose children study in schools such as Shalom Hills, Salwan Public, Blue Bells International, Shiv Nadar and DPS-Ghaziabad, met MLA Umesh Aggarwal on Sunday and then took out a protest march from the church in Civil Lines to the residence of PWD minister Rao Narbir Singh.
 
 They alleged that the authorities were feigning helplessness, instead of acting to solve the crisis faced by the parents. “We took out a silent march till Rao Narbir Singh’s home to draw his attention to our plight. We’ve been compelled to take this step. No one is listening to us,” said Rajdeep Kaur, a parent. She added there was no clear policy in the state’s law books that empowers the authorities to act against these schools. “We will not relent till our demands are addressed by the authorities,” she said. The protesters could not meet Singh as he wasn’t available.
 
 However, the parents said their meeting with Aggarwal was fruitful. “He (Aggarwal) agreed with our view. We briefed him about the inequity of the schools and the loot they were committing. We also informed him that three students from Shalom Hills schools had been expelled after they refused to pay the hiked fee. He heard us patiently and asked us to meet him again on May 3. He promised to take the issue up with the district education officer and divisional commissioner of Gurgaon,” said Mahesh Yadav, another parent.
