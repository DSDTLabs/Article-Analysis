For entrepreneur  , business has always been about making a positive difference to the lives of young artistes.   singer Shaan’s wife has experienced the entertainment industry from close quarters.   says, “I have seen such talented people giving up on their dreams because they couldn’t make it big in this city. This is something that   and I firmly believe in. That motivated us to flag off  . The idea was to make a happy difference to the lives of these artistes for all the love that we have received over the years and create an ecosystem that will help them grow and have a stable career.”

  Her company is working towards changing the way live entertainment is consumed and giving India its next generation of singers. 
 
  Radhika says, “The industry is competitive space where change is the only constant. I remember the difficulties we faced when Shaan had just started off. Other professions have a defined growth route, but our industry doesn’t have one. You can be a star one day and be forgotten the next day. We have seen talented professionals go down financially as well as psychologically. Shaan and I had a deep desire to fix this for emerging artistes. We wanted to bring out the best in people professionally, personally and financially.” 
 
  This thought drives her company which is an innovation to bring in concepts, strategies and solutions for corporate companies, brands and individuals. 
 
  Radhika sums up, “It’s always good to have the business graph going north. It’s great to have happy people around and make it a constantly growing community.”
