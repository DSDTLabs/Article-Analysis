JAIPUR: Thirty-five percent of the   will live in   by 2050. The population projection made by the   states that demography of desert state is fast tilting towards urban areas. However, the pace of urbanization is much lower than other states with the same demographic compositions.

 The urban populace shot up from 23.9% in 2001 to 24.2% as on March 1, 2017. The migration will register a slight rise of 24.4% by 2022. The populace in urban centres will show the sudden acceleration from 2022 onwards with 25% and jump to 29.1% in 2026. The phenomenal rise of 4% in four years from 2025-2026 can be attributed to the high growth rate in early 2000.
 
 “The rise of 4% population in urban areas in four years against 2% rise in the 12 years from 2010-2022 proves that   has seen the slowest growth in urban population.The reason being a self-sustained model in villages followed by the development of suburban towns at every district had restricted the migration,“ said Laxmi Thakor, head of the department, population studies, MDS University , Ajmer. Raising alarm over the projections, KB Kothari, former policy advisor and planner,   , New York, says, “State needs to pull up its infrastructural needs in urban centres to meet the mass exodus of population from the rural areas. The government needs to create suburban cities at strategic locations else cities like Jaipur, Udaipur, Kota and Jodhpur will see the fast demographic change,“ said Kothari.
 
 Reports say that 28%-32% of the population in the urban areas live in slum areas in the state. “Migration from the rural areas will add to the urban poor kitty . It will put the burden on already stressed facilities like medical, community development and education. The idea is to build capacity of suburban areas like it was done in Noida and Gurugram. Both the cities sharing the extended urban space of Delhi,“ said Kothari.
 
 A SMART city document related to Udaipur city points out that city receives over a lakh floating population from villages in a range of 50 kms.Those beyond 50 kms add up in the slum areas. “Our study says that if a network of roads can be created, the population which could add burden to the urban space will turn into a floating population,“ said Reepunjaya Singh, professor, urban development, Rajasthan Institute of Public Administration.
 
 Meanwhile, the population of Rajasthan will also shoot up to 8.15 crore by 2026. The population of the state as on March 1 was estimated to be around 7.39 crore with 3.86 men and 3.53 women. Every year, the population is rising by 10 lakh. The growth of population will see a slight fall between 2025 and 2026.
