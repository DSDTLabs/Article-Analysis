PUNE:   deputy governor   on Saturday warned to pull up banks in the upcoming   if they do not adhere to proper base rate reductions and make the  .

 Mundra said the banks have neither been transparent in passing on the interest rate cuts to borrowers, nor have they migrated majority of loans to the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR). In accordance with the scheme, the banks are required to revise the   every month and the base rate is changed quarterly. 
 
 Mundra, while addressing the 13th convocation of the   here, said the banks have used no formula and only discretion in deciding their base rates.
 
 He cited the example of a bank (without naming it) that has reduced the MCLR by 105 basis points (BPS) in the last one year and reduced the base rate by only 10 BPS while retaining 70% of customers in the base rate regime. He said in all likelihood, majority of other banks were following the same process.
 
 “When the MCLR was announced, it was expected that there will be a clear migration from base rate to MCLR. We felt that borrowers would be given a fair opportunity for migration and they will have a clarity about the migration,” Mundra said. “Under no system of calculation, this gap can be agreed to. There can be marginal difference, but not this much,” he added.
 
 Mundra also said that one year after the structure for internal ombudsman scheme was proposed, many banks — especially the public sector banks — have not made it operational. 
 
 “In the current supervisory cycle, non-compliance will be viewed very seriously and may attract even penal action,” he said, adding that the banks were not supporting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in times of distress. 
 
 "A large number of MSMEs are becoming sick because of the banks (attitude). We have given several tools to the banks for enhancement of working capital needs and terms loans, But they have been not put to use to the extent they should have been,” Mundra added.
