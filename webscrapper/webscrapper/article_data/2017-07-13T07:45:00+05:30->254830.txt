GURUGRAM:  , who took charge as the new   on Tuesday, visited the Gurgaon   on Wednesday to inspect the existing facilities and explore possibilities of its expansion, keeping in mind the fact that around 50 trains halt at this station every day. He was accompanied by a team of railway officials.

 The Haryana government had announced that it would connect the railway station with Huda City Centre by building a Metro corridor.
 
 “The existing lone entry and exit to the railway station will not be sufficient to tackle the crowd. The station requires a second access so that thousands of passengers who use this railway station are not inconvenienced. The railway authorities should upgrade the facilities at the station under public-private-partnership model, and turn it into a modern railway station,” said Vinay Pratap.
 
 The district authorities also discussed the need to decongest the approach road to the station, which is dotted by several street vendors and other encroachments that eat into the available road space. 
 
 “The stretch between Daulatabad flyover and the railway station is choked as the right of way is limited and there are several encroachments along the way. Vehicles are parked illegally on this approach road, leading to congestion. A foot-over bridge in the vicinity for smoother movement of people is need of the hour. The road will also be widening and additional parking space will be created so that people are not forced to park on the road,” he said.
 
 On Saturday, the Haryana government had announced that it would construct a Metro route to link the existing Metro station at Huda City Centre with the   railway station. The corridor will pass through Subhash chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Sector 9 and large parts of old Gurgaon. “A detailed project report on this route will be made soon,” an official said.
