Besides being popular for her antics and 'nighties' on ‘Bigg Boss 11’,   was also lauded by the followers of the show for her loyalty towards her friend  . No wonder then that when she decided to throw a party to celebrate her stint on the show, several inmates of the recently concluded season, including Vikas, Jyoti Kumari, Priyank Sharma and   turned up to raise a toast to the 'bindass' lady.

  
 Never the one to mince words, Arshi was in her element at her party. When she was asked whether her co-participants   and   would attend the do, she responded with her trademark candour. She said, "Well, I have invited both. Hina read my message, but didn't respond. She is trying to be away from the media for some time. Shilpa on the other told me she'll be flying and will try to make it directly from the airport."
 
 Well, while the party continued till the wee hours, we were informed by our sources that neither Hina nor Shilpa turned up. Well, that just goes to show how momentary Bigg Boss friendships really are.
