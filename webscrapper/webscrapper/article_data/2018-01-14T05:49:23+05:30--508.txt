THANE: Following a trial that lasted nearly three years, the district sessions court on Thursday sentenced two brothers to life for murdering their 30-year-old neighbour.

 Additional sessions judge PP Jadhav convicted   (35) and his brother Aamir (23) for the murder of Mohammad Ijaz Noorhasan Sayyed, their neighbour in the   area of   on April 7, 2015.
 
 The judge upheld public prosecutor Vinit Kulkarni’s argument that the duo had a clear motive to kill Sayyed, with whom they had a longstanding feud.
 
 The victim had reportedly made unparliamentary comments about Aamir’s wife, which had led to a nasty fight between them.
 
 At 9.15 pm on April 7, 2015, Sayyed stepped out of his house when the two brothers attacked him with a chopper, killing him instantly.
 
 The court was told the accused cleaned the blood-stained chopper and disposed of the weapon.
 
 A total of four witnesses, including the victim’s wife, who was eyewitness in the case, were examined.
 
 The court upheld the eyewitness account and convicted the brothers.
 
 The defence counsel argued the two accused had not perpetrated the crime. However, the argument did not hold water with the court and the judge dismissed his submissions.
 
 Then police officer   of Mumbra police station was investigating officer in the case.
