BERHAMPUR: In an effort to facilitate the annual mass nesting of endangered Olive Ridley turtles near the mouth of the river Rushikuly, school students along with local volunteers cleaned a four kilometre long stretch from   to Podampeta, on Tuesday. 

 Over 100 students from six high schools of nearby villages, along with forest personnel and wildlife activists, picked up around three tonnes of litter from the beach over three hours, to prepare the area for the mass nesting which is slated to happen later this month.
 
 "Most students who have taken part in the clean drive were members of the eco clubs of their respective schools," said  , co-ordinator of the district eco club. Several school teachers, environmental activists and local fishermen also took part in the drive.
 
 "Cleaning of the beach before mass nesting was one of the strategies adopted by the forest department for safe and smooth nesting. Earlier, forest personnel had to clean the beach. But this practice of involving school children has been going on for the last ten years," Bej added.
 
 Bej was the guide of a recent project on the emerging problems in the conservation of the Olive Ridley sea turtle. In the course of the project students of the G K High School, Subalaya, had pointed out that mass nesting was hindered by the piles of garbage on the beach.
 
 After Gahiramatha, the   river mouth has emerged as the second largest rookery for Olive Ridley turtles. "The turtles can climb onto the beach at any time to lay eggs, so we have also deployed forest staff and volunteers," said   divisional forest officer, A K Behera.
