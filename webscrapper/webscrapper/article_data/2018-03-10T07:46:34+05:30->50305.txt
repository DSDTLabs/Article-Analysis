CHANDIGARH: Bhiwani district child welfare office (DCWO) is facing investigation for allegedly leasing out 11 commercial plots of 900 square feet each and a swimming pool site at throwaway rates. The plots and pool site are situated on Meham road, in the heart of Bhiwani town.

 The CMO on Friday directed the Bhiwani deputy commissioner to probe entire incident and stop the proceedings. 
 
 Denying any wrongdoing, Bhiwani district child welfare officer   said, “The entire process was monitored by an 18-member committee comprising officers of various departments. There was no lapse and no undervaluation.” Sources said the land, valued around Rs 22 crore, belongs to the   State Council for Child Welfare and has the governor and the chief minister as ex-officio members.
 
 When contacted, officer on special duty (OSD) in the Haryana chief minister’s office (CMO),   confirmed receipt of complaint related to leasing out of land in Bhiwani by DCWO. “We have a clear-cut policy of leasing out or allotment of land through e-auction only. The deputy commissioner has been asked to submit a report as soon as possible so that further action could follow in the matter,” he said.
 
 According to information available, the child welfare council had advertised the sites in a Jind-based vernacular newspaper on December 22, 2017 and asked the applicants to complete formalities by December 28.
 
 It couldn’t be ascertained when the council gave possession of the land but sources said the entire issue came to light last week, when lessees started construction at commercial sites.
 
 It is alleged that 30 persons had been allotted the commercial sites at the rate of Rs 5,800 per month for ground floor and Rs 3,200 per month for the first floor. The huge plot for swimming pool had been leased out for Rs 50,000 per annum against the market value running into several lakhs. The shops and swimming pool sites have been leased out for long period.
