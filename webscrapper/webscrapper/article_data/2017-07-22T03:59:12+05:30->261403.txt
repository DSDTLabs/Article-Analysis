KOLKATA: The GJM leadership is exploring legal steps on the Calcutta high court order directing 23 people, including the party brass, to attend a city court on Monday in connection with the  . 

 Preliminary legal opinions suggest the leaders can cite the fact that the July 24 date was not originally fixed by the city court for charge-framing as a plausible reason to not attend. 
 
 These opinions suggest this date was originally fixed to hear the eight discharge petitions. "So, if a contempt-of-court case is filed for not attending, there could be enough legal grounds to argue against it," said a GJM leader who spoke to a senior criminal lawyer.
 
 According to senior GJM leaders, senior criminal lawyers in Kolkata have already been contacted on the issue and their opinion is being sought. Prima facie, sources said, there appears to be little time to file a review petition on the order in the HC or to appeal against it in the Supreme Court. "Saturday is the only day we have to file an appeal and get reprieve, if any. This appears difficult," a GJM leader, among the 23 accused, told TOI.
 
 Consultations are also being sought on whether the GJM leaders can be represented in court through their legal counsel. The state too is keeping a close watch on the unfolding legal tribulations.
 
 It remains to be seen if the GJM leadership can get around this court order but the prospect of appearing in Kolkata, where the   runs the show, will not be very attractive.
