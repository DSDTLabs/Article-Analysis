NEW DELHI: Representatives of   and   from across the city gathered at Defence Colony on Friday to devise strategies to mount opposition to the proposed changes by   to the  . An online petition, launched through change.org with the title “Save Our City”, had already seen hundreds of signatories by evening.

 Some of the demands in a joint resolution adopted at the meeting included punitive action against officials under whom the alleged illegalities had taken place, area-wise study of the impact of the proposed amendments and ensuring privacy of people who filed objections to the DDA move.
 
 Rajiv Kakria, who represented GK-I RWA and is also a member of the Save Our City forum, said that the amendments would prove to be a “death knell” for Delhi. “The latest amendments that have been proposed are much the same as the previous public notice issued in February. These don’t conform to the MC Mehta judgment. We will present a point-by-point rebuttal to DDA’s notification on June 9,” he said. 
 
 Pankaj Agarwal from Delhi RWAs’ Joint Front said the common man wasn’t able to comprehend the real impact of the amendments and that was why area-wise impact studies were crucial. Referring to DDA’s notice, which promised to make officials accountable for allowing illegal construction, Chetan Sharma from CONRWA, another RWA body, said: “Similar assurances and promises were given to SC in 2006, but nothing happened. For 12 years, everything has remained on paper. The courts must fix the loopholes.” 
 
 RWAs have also decided to point out area-specific problems and violations of the master plan and the problems being suffered by residents due to these. Some of the problems that came up for discussion on Friday included illegal guesthouses running in and around Greater Kailash, tuition centres operating in Mukherjee Nagar and illegal store houses flourishing in Malviya Nagar and Saket.
 
 More than 30 RWAs and NGOs were part of the consultative process.
