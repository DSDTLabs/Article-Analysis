Madurai: A committee comprising parliamentary standing committee, National Law Commission and the President of India should review the judgment delivered by Justices A K Goel and U U Lalith in regard to the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act which allowed an accused to get anticipatory bail, said executive director of NGO Evidence, A Kathir.

 Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, he said it was usual procedure to register FIR based on a complaint, but here the judges had observed that the punishment rate in these cases was minimal and said that the FIR should be registered only after a thorough inquiry. “If that is the case, the punishment rate in sexual harassment cases is 7 to 12 % and that of murder is 35 – 40 %. Can we say that these cases should be registered only after a thorough inquiry?” he asked.
 
 Taking a generalised view by taking just one case into consideration was not acceptable, said Kathir. As many as 40,801 cases were registered under the SC/ST Atrocities Act in India in the year 2016, of which only 1,291 were registered in Tamil Nadu. There were 1,565 police stations in the state and the numbers proved that less than 1% of cases were registered in many police stations. A study showed that FIRs are not registered in 95 % of cases and this was not taken into consideration by the judges, he said. Reports had showed that the officers investigating these cases acted in a partial manner. tnn
