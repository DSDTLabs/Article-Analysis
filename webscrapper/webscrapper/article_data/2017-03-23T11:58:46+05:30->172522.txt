MUNGER: The sadar   on Wednesday earned the dubious distinction of getting an   (intensive care unit) for the fourth time since 2007. 

 Munger DM U K Singh inaugurated the ICU on the sadar hospital premises on Wednesday. He hoped the unit would benefit serious patients who were otherwise rushed to   for treatment.
 
 Civil surgeon Dr Shreenath said the ICU would function 24X7, for which a panel of trained medical officers has been formed.
 
 Sources recalled an ICU in the sadar hospital was first opened by the then state health minister in 2007. However, it could not become operational as the hospital was said to lack trained medical officers to run it.
 
 The ICU was inaugurated for the second time by the   in 2009. However, the instruments procured earlier for the unit had by then rusted, and the ICU remained non-functional. 
 
 It was inaugurated again in 2015, but it did not function apparently because the ICU room was reportedly not scientifically fit.
