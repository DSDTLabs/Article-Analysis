CHENNAI: The cost of being under-insured is likely to hit Punjab National Bank ( ) hard. Currently, the public sector bank has only bought a basic banker’s indemnity policy, which covers employee fraud, to the extent of Rs 2 crore — or 0.70% of the total fraud of around Rs 11,300 crore — according to highly-placed sources.

 With the RBI likely to direct PNB to pay the entire Rs 11,300 crore, it will fall on its books and not other banks such as  , Allahabad Bank, Bank of Baroda or  , who have bought the letters of undertaking (LoUs) in the primary or secondary market.
 
 Unlike other public and private sector banks, which have started taking specialised covers for trade finance, bill discounting and cyber insurance, PNB has not done so, said sources. For the last two years, this cover has been primarily underwritten by   (40%) and the remainder (60%) by the other three public sector   companies (see graphic).
 
 A United India official said, “PNB pays a premium of about Rs 5 crore for banker’s indemnity policy. The policy does not have an overall sum insured — it has specific limits for what can be covered for property loss, fire, burglary or fraud. Under insider fraud, they’ve taken only up to Rs 2 crore cover and only that will come into effect.”
 
 He added, “But remember, the case is from 2011. Initially, they were honouring their claims. We are yet to know from which month, which year, they stopped making payments and the fraud started. We have been covering PNB for the last two years only.”
