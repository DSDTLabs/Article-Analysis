MUMBAI: The   has reduced the rates to be charged as transfer fees on sale of flats and apartments on   in the VIP category, comprising bureaucracy, judiciary and scientists. 

 In case of the VIP category the transfer fees ranged from 18%, 8% to 6% of the Ready Reckoner (RR) Rate, depending on whether the sale/transfer was carried out within 5, 10 or 15 years respectively. This has been revised to 5%, 3% and 3%.
 
 In case of the non-VIP category the transfer fees ranged from 9%, 4% to 3% of the RR Rate for the same period. This has been revised only for the first five years and brought to 5% from 9%.
 
  "Since the government has stopped giving land for nearly two decades now, the rate for first two categories 5 and 10 years really don't apply. It is the sale of flats after 15 years that is most important. In this category for VIPs it has been halved while for ordinary citizens it remains the same," said Salil Rameshchandran, activist and founder of Federation of Government Granted Lands. 
 
  These were lands sold by the government from the 50s till 2000 to groups of people who had applied for land for housing/commercial purpose. While obtaining prior approval from the collector for sale/transfer was always mandatory it was not being strictly enforced by the government. In 2017 in a bid to raise its sagging revenues the government finally decided to act. It came up with a new policy increasing the transfer fee for those who had not complied with the requirement of a prior   for sale/transfer of flats. 
 
  This has become a controversial subject ever since residents of housing societies began demanding that their land be converted to freehold. There is already a PIL pending in the HC. While earlier there was no transfer fee on transfer of a flat if it was done through a gift deed or donation even if no prior approval from the collector was obtained, through the GR issued on Friday, the government has decided to charge 3% of the RR Rate as transfer fee.
