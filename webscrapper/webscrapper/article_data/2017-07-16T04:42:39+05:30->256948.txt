NAVI MUMBAI: While the city received over 100mm of average rainfall in the last 24 hours,   and water logging along Thane-Belapur road, old  ,  ,  ,   made commuting a taxing task for motorists. 

 Traffic cops had a tough time streamlining vehicular flow at flyovers and low-lying spots where traffic slowdown was witnessed. Five cases of tree collapse were reported in the city. However, the civic disaster management cell swung into action to clear roads and bylanes to pave the way for motorists and pedestrians. MIDC roads in TTC area and Taloja industrial belt were also in a mess. 
 
 Low lying areas at T-Junction in Airoli, Vashi Gaon, Turbhe flyover, Hiranandani Chock at Khaghar and CBD circle were waterlogged with incessant rain all through the day, leaving residents in the lurch. “Driving was a challenge due to poor visibility armed with pockmarked roads and water logging. This shows how the agencies have neglected pre-monsoon work,” said motorist Shantanu Dubey. 
 
 Subways at Koparkhairane, Kalamboli, Ghansoli, Airoli and Mukand Company were submerged and motorists had a tough time wading through knee-deep water. 
 
 “The drainage system failed to flush out the accumulated rain water. Many bikers got stuck in the middle of the Koparkhairane subway. This has led to traffic congestion as well,” said Amit Gurav, a local resident. Tree falling caused trouble for residents at Airoli, Vashi and Nerul. 
 
 Traffic jam was seen at APMC market yards where waterlogging created havoc in the morning peak hour when vegetables and fruits were being loaded and unloaded. All the entrance and exit points in APMC markets were submerged. 
 
 The Vashi node received the highest rainfall of 115mm in the last 24 hours, from 4pm on July 14 to 4pm on July 15. Airoli got 105mm rainfall during the same slot. Belapur and Nerul registered 85mm and 74mm rain respectively in the last 24 hours. Dam catchment pockets which are on the outskirt of Panvel received moderate rainfall.
