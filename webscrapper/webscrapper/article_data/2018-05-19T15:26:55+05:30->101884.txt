 might not have had any release in the recent past, but that doesn’t stop his   from showering their love on the actor. The actor, too in turn, has shown some touching gesture to his fans. For instance, take this recent incident. 

 Madhan, a fan of STR and a functionary of one of his fan clubs passed away last week. Madhan’s friends were posting pictures of the youngster on the walls when STR who was passing by the road, immediately stopped his car. He got down and started pasting some of the posters himself. Now, isn’t that a touching gesture?
