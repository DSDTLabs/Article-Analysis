For anyone living in a tropical paradise, summer months are the time to hit the beach. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t look stylish while doing so. “India is blessed with a long coastline and beach fashion should be an important part of our lifestyle. High time now that people ditch their regular clothing and incorporate proper beach culture here,” says designer Aniket Satam. Whether it’s a romper, flowy maxi dress over a bikini, a knotted T-shirt or shirt as a cover-up, metallic outerwear or just a pair of killer sunglasses to go with your sports luxe swim suit, jump on board the trend train with fashionable beach essentials. 

 
 Summer 2018 makes a strong case for maximalism over minimalism, with the key inspirations being tribal and graphic bold prints, contrasting seams and sexy cut-outs. Eclectic, fun prints are big this year. Designer Shweta Agarwal says, “Go for polka dots, asymmetrical feminine ruffles and fringes. Think functional sporty tops with cheeky bottoms. Or go super sexy with a high-cut one piece swimwear or bring out the athlete in you by wearing activewear swimsuits with sporty bralettes.” 
 
 The 80s are back with their kaleidoscopes of rainbow colours, stripes and boho silhouettes not just on the ramp but also on the beaches. “Bright shades of hot pink, sunny yellow and turquoise blue in high-waisted bikini bottoms and tied bikini tops are a must,” says designer Nandita Mahtani. Beach fashion isn’t restricted to bikinis and shorts. Designer Dwiti Bhuwalka suggests investing in spaghetti dresses, sheer beach pants, oversized shirts, and cropped hoodies. 
 
 Dramatic cover-ups adorned with embellishments, sheer embroidered sarongs come in handy when you want to add a dose of glamour. Mahtani calls cover ups a must-carry. “They add a bit of flair and fashion to your pictures. Delicate lace kaftans or tie-ups are perfect to tone down the bright colours. Use a cover up in a pop of yellow or sequins for a beach party,” she says.
  
 
 Elevate your beach look with the right accessories. “Fastened belts drawing attention to your waist are the hottest accessory trend this summer. Uber stylish sunglasses not only protect you from the harsh UV rays but also add style. Think slim 50s cat-eye sunglasses,” Agarwal says. Comfortable sandals are a must when exploring a beach town. “Tie-up flats or gladiator sandals are perfect with statement totes, sunnies and outsized hats. Or keep it simple with a pair of flip flops. Choose thinner thonged ones,” says designer Saaksha Bhat. 
 Finish the look with an oversized floppy hat or fedora in neutral colours like nude, off-white, camel or beige. Whatever you choose to wear, remember to never over accessorise on the beach, and definitely avoid too much make-up. But do invest in a high SPF sunscreen. “Think subtle bling. Pick one eye-catching piece and curate the look around it. A few stacked bracelets or dainty anklets and huge cocktail rings with vintage-style gold hoops or abstract metallic earrings are enough to bring in the sass,” says designer Shivani Avasthy.
