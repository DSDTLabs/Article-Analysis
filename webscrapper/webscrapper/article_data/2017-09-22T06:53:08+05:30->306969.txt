HYDERABAD: Even as works on the three corridors of the Hyderabad   Rail are progressing at a brisk pace, municipal minister   said the state government is considering taking up the second phase of the project soon.

 “A team of officials led by special advisor Rajiv Sharma and municipal administration secretary Navin Mittal and other officials recently visited Tokyo to study the latest technology related to the Metro rail and the amenities available at the stations,“ the MA&UD minister said.
 
  said this while speaking to the media here on Thursday . When asked about the old city alignment of the metro rail, the minister said the government has not taken any decision on it.
 
 “The metro rail in old city is a complex issue. Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi also spoke to me on the matter. We hope to take a call on itsoon,“ the minister said.
 
 It may be recalled that the old city alignment of the metro rail has not been finalized by the state government due to   opposition to the plan proposed by the authorities.
 
 KTR said efforts were being made to provide the best facilities at the metro stations.
 
 “Some people objected to raising a central medium along the corridors. But there would be Foot Over Bridges (FOBs) on both sides of metro stations with elevators. On water leakages from metro rail track on the roads, the minister said the issue would be addressed by L&T soon. “All the facilities such as multi-level parking, FOBs at various locations, street furniture and other facilities would be completed within one year,“ he said.
