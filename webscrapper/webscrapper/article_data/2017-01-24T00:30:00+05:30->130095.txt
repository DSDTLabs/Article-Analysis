Bengaluru: It was a day of mixed emotions for senior IPS officer  , who is tipped to be the next director general and inspector general of police (DG&IGP) of   after incumbent Om Prakash retires by January-end.

 On the one hand, Dutta was happy after the Supreme Court on Monday “dismissed as withdrawn” a long-pending case against him. It was filed by farmer leader G Mallesh, who challenged the Karnataka High Court’s order quashing a case lodged against Dutta when he was ADGP (anti-corruption wing) in the Lokayukta in 2009. He was charged with allegedly forcing a Bengaluru college to give him the mandatory 70% attendance to pursue a regular LLB course, while on duty.
 
 On the other hand, Dutta suffered a setback as he failed to get a clean chit, which would have automatically exonerated him in the same case lodged before the Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC), Union ministry of home affairs.
 
 “I have withdrawn the case on technical grounds on a suggestion from our lawyer. But we will consider pursuing it in future after rectifying the anomaly,” Mallesh said. He said he had petitioned the CVC, which had registered a complaint and forwarded it to the Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO), home ministry, for a detailed inquiry but there has been no progress. “I am still awaiting a call from the CVC for inquest,” he added.
 
 Sources from the chief minister’s office said Dutta has a week’s time to get the pending case in the CVC cleared to become eligible for the selection. If he fails to do so, senior woman IPS officer Neelamani N Raju will be the obvious choice. Two others are in the race —   H C Kishore Chandra and DGP M N Reddi.
