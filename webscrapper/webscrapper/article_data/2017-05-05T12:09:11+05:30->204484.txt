MADIKERI: Known for her unique protests, tribal leader J K   on Thursday morning climbed a 40ft tree at Diddalli in   district and protested for five hours demanding rehabilitation of 577 tribal families who were evicted from the forest area.

 The woman came down only after revenue minister Kagodu   called to pacify her. The minister assured Muthamma that evicted tribal families will be given revenue land outside Diddalli forest area. Thimmappa clarified that forest land cannot be sanctioned to the evicted families.
 
 Speaking to reporters, the tribal leader said: “The state government should sanction five cents of land in Diddalli and construct a house for each family. If the government is allotting land outside the forest area, a minimum of two acres should be given to each family. If these demands are not met, we will not relocate.“
 
 After being evicted from the forest, tribals are returning to the controversial area and have built 280 huts there.
