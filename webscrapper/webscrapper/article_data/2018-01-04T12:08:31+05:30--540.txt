JAISALMER:   being run over by trains is continuing unabated in Jaisalmer as the authorities concerned seem to be least bothered to check these accidents.

 Five   vultures were run over by a train in Lathi Dholia area in Jaisalmer district on Wednesday. This is the fourth such incident in the last 35 days. So far 47 vultures have died.
 
 According to sources, in all these incidents, carelessness of gangman has come to light as he has not removed dead animal from the tracks. The forest department is concerned over the repeated incidents, but except for writing letters to administration and serving notice to railways, it canâ€™t do anything more. Before this incident, the forest department was taking advice from the experts for legal action against the railway.
 
 Wildlife lover and union woman and child development minister   had also expressed her concern over the continuous incidents and called forest department officers two weeks ago to take strict steps, but still the story is as it was.
