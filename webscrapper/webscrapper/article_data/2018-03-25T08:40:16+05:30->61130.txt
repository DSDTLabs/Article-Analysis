 Fire fighters from Halol were rushed to the site, but they could only control the fire which was sparked close to the motorable road. Forest department tried till late night to bring control on the fire which had spread deep into the forest. A forest department official said that they are using several bags of sand to bring control on the fire and are also cleaning the area beyond the fire of dry leaves and trees so that the fire does not spread further.
 
 According to forest department sources the fire could have been sparked due to extreme heat during the day time or some other reason. Besides sprinkling sand, foresters are hoping that the fire gets under control on its own because there is very little they can do, the forest official said.
 
 The Kalika Mata Temple witnessed huge rush on Saturday as it was the seventh day of Chaitri Navratri. However, the pilgrims did not face any problems as the forest fire had sparked towards the side of Baska village which is on the rear side of the temple.
