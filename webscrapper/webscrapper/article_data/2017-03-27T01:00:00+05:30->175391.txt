There are too many misconceptions and misunderstandings surrounding my film, ' '. I feel the need to clear the air once and for all. 'Padmavati' is a film about a revered Rajput Queen and her valiant fight for honour and dignity. Itâ€™s a film that every Indian will be proud of.

 My team and I have carefully researched every aspect of information available on   for making the film. There was never any alleged romantic scene, dream sequence or imaginary song between Rani Padmavati and   in the script. I repeat, there NEVER was and NOR is there any such scene between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji.
 
 
  
 While we have clarified this multiple times across various media platforms, the vandalism against the film deeply pains me. This violence is unjustified and not acceptable as it is merely based on hearsay, allegations and accusations, and not on facts. As an artist, I too believe in the freedom of expression, but I'm also aware of the responsibility that comes along with this freedom. We do not intend to hurt the sentiments of any community and can confidently say that Mewar will be proud of the film. 
 
 My team and I have met with some of the Rajput leaders, who, upon receipt of our clarification, have agreed to support us and have also signed our letter and promised cooperation in support of the making of the film. I hope this puts to rest all the misconceptions regarding the film. I take this opportunity to thank the film fraternity and the media, who have constantly spoken in support of the film and protested against any kind of violence/vandalism against artists and their freedom to express.
