KOLKATA: State   Partha Chatterjee has urged   to introduce a six-week English crash course for students to increase their employability in the   as well as abroad.

 
 “For over a decade-and-a-half English was not taught at the primary level eroding the bases of a generation of students. These courses, therefore, would help students face their job interviews better,” Chatterjee said at a job-fair organised by private engineering colleges at the Netaji Indoor stadium on Sunday.
 
 Chatterjee said the Mamata Banerjee government wanted students to excel globally and hence the stress on English. The state, he said, was also setting up English medium schools. Chatterjee also urged private engineering colleges to recruit better faculty members.
