An elderly couple,   and  , from Melur has been claiming that they are the real parents of actor  . They claim that the actor ran away from home to join movies, when he was a teenager. The couple even sent a legal notice to the actor last October. Recently, the actor with his parents,   and  , were present at the court in Madurai to fight the case. At the court, the actor was asked to prove that he had no identification marks that the couple had mentioned about. Now, the case has been adjourned to March 9.

 Talking about the recent developments, Kasthuri Raja, says, “All this doesn’t upset us as we know that their claims are false. So, instead of handling it emotionally, we’ve decided to patiently follow the course of the law.” He adds, “I started my film career in 1991 and I’ve been a public figure since then. Everybody knows about my family and therefore I need not explain it to anyone that Dhanush is my son, except to the court. As we’re law-abiding citizens, we’ve submitted all proper records that are required.” So, will Dhanush have to undergo a DNA test? “As the case is going on in the court now, I cannot comment about the proceedings,” he sums up.
