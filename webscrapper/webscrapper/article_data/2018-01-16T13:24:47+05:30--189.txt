THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Stepping up the attack against Kodiyeri Balakrishnanfor his pro-China speech in Alappuzha on Saturday,   leaders here on Monday filed a police complaint against the   state secretary.

 BJP Thiruvananthapuram district president   met state police chief Loknath Behra claiming that Balakrishnan’s speech at CPM Alappuzha district meeting on Sunday amounted to sedition and demanded that a police case be registered for speaking in open against the country.
 
 BJP leaders said the statement should be viewed seriously, especially at a time when India was facing severe threat from China. “The statement came shortly after the Indian Army chief's revelation that India was facing more threat from China than any other countries,” BJP leaders said, adding that the remarks were aimed at extending a helping hand to the country's foe.
 
 “We suspect that he made the statement after receiving some sort of help from China. The statement amounted to mockery of Indian Army. The fact that such a statement came from a person who served as the state’s home minister and   doubled the gravity of the same,” BJP said in the complaint.
 
 After chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan courted a controversy for allegedly supporting North Korea for its bold stance against the US during the party district conference in Kozhikode, Balakrishnan had criticised India's attitude and approach towards China.
 
 The CPM leader had claimed that India has joined the league of capitalist countries –America, Japan and Australia – in unleashing attack on China. The capitalist countries stepped up their attack against China shortly after Chinese communist party congress declared that country would not allow any other countries to intervene in its internal matters. China had also said that it would not stand a mute spectator if any country tried to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries, Balakrishnan had pointed out.
