CHENNAI: Airports Authority of India ( ) has sped up groundwork at Neyveli,   and Thanjavur airports to ready them for flight operations by year-end, a deadline set by the ministry of civil aviation.

 The ministry has already auctioned routes to these airports under the regional connectivity scheme Udan. Spice-Jet has bagged the Chennai-Thanjavur route, Turbo Aviation the   route and   has been given rights to fly from Neyveli under phase 1 of the Udan scheme. The routes were awarded in January. A senior AAI official said runway re-carpeting work is going on at the   owned by Neyveli Lignite Corporation and a small building will be constructed to handle passengers and baggage.
 
 “Discussions are going on with the state to acquire around 30 acres of land in Vellore to extend the runway. The runway at Vellore is only 2,400ft and is not enough for 60 to 70-seater planes to land,” the official added.
 
 Salem airport has a small facility for a terminal but Neyveli, Thanjavur and Vellore need similar buildings. “Thanjavur was with AAI long ago but was not in use. The airstrip is 9,000ft and ideal for Udan flights. Some more land is needed to build a small terminal and parking area,” the AAI official said. Work can be completed soon as AAI is going to provide no-frills terminals, which resemble halls, for passengers to wait and security checks. There will not be baggage conveyors and other mechanised facility.
