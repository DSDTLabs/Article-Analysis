JAIPUR:   on Friday stayed the recruitment of teachers (grade II) of all subjects till the HC principal bench of Jodhpur pronounces its order on the disputes over the answer keys. 

 The single bench of Justice V S Siradhana issued the order on a petition by Amit Kumar and others.
 
 The petitioner said, the Jodhpur bench of the high court had reserved its order on the disputed questions after the answer key were challenged in the court while the RPSC instead of waiting for the order had started issuing appointment order. The petitioners pointed out that the questions in general knowledge is also disputed which is a common paper for all subjects. So the outcome of the court decision has bearing on the merit list. Even the court could order a revised merit list. So the appointment order issued to some candidates could not be justified.
 
 The court then stayed any appointment to the post till the court pronounces its order.
