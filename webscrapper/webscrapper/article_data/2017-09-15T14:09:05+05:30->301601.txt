GURUGRAM: Close on the heels of the Ryan horror, the city was racked by yet another atrocity in a school, after a nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped digitally by her school teacher inside the premises in the evening on Wednesday.

 The survivor, a Class IV student, approached police with her mother the same evening. Based on the motherâ€™s complaint, a case was registered and the accused teacher, Ram Chander (52), originally from   in Rewari district, arrested. Chander has confessed to his crime during interrogation. Police produced him in a city court on Thursday, which sent him to judicial custody.
 
 The incident happened around 6.30pm on Wednesday inside Government Primary School, Prem Nagar Ki Dhani, near Kasan village. The school has two teachers, one of whom lives outside, while Chander lives in a room inside school premises.
 
 The survivor had gone to the school with other children to play.
