LUCKNOW: Farmers in  , who were promised a   waiver by the   government, have now been given an ultimatum - either register by March 10 or lose the waiver benefit. This means that about 50 lakh farmers will get less than 15 days to apply for the loan waiver. 

 UP agriculture minister   told newspersons here on Saturday that 36 lakh farmers have already been given Rs 21,000 crore under the scheme, adding that the government's target is to disburse Rs 36,000 crore to 86 lakh farmers.
 
 Shahi said that the process of granting loan waiver has been on for a year now, and hence a deadline had to be set to complete the programme so that the government machinery and the manpower engaged in it for over a year could be freed and can focus on other work.
 
 The BJP, in its election promise ahead of the state   polls last year, had assured that farm loans of up to Rs 1 lakh, availed before March 31, 2016, will be written off. Now, with this deadline in place, only 15 working days of the 19-day period has been left for farmers to complete all formalities.
 
 The loan waiver scheme had run into trouble earlier when many farmers were given relief of paltry sums - Rs 5, Rs 10 and Rs 100. Many farmers, who spent hundreds of rupees to attend loan melas, had to go back disappointed with waiver certificates of such paltry amounts.
 
 It was on the intervention of chief minister   that the agriculture department had stopped distributing waiver certificates to farmers with less than Rs 10,000 loan.
