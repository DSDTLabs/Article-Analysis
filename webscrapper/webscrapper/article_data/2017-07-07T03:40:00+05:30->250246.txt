Panaji: Just days after BJP national president Amit Shah had a meeting at Goa International Airport, Dabolim, a Congress leader has now sought permission from Airports Authority of India (AAI) to organise his   reception at the very same venue. The letter comes after the AAI refused to file a police complaint against the BJP and Amit Shah for violating security norms around the naval airbase.

 In the letter to Goa airport director B C Negi, Goa Congress secretary Janardhan Bhandari sought permission to host his wedding reception at the airport as his guests would be arriving by air from across the country.
 
 “I cannot afford to make arrangements for the stay and travel of so many guests, it would be nice if you could permit me to use your airport for my wedding reception in September 2017. I will fix the date as per the availability of the airport as per your convenience,” Bhandari wrote.
 
 The application, which has been rejected by airport officials, clearly mocks at AAI. “I am very much thankful to you for allowing Goa airport for private functions, you deserve appreciation for your bold decision,” Bhandari wrote.
 
 Bhandari wrote that the airport being a naval air base, he would instruct his guests to take necessary precautions and had also decided not to have a photographer for his reception at the airport.
 
 The meeting at the airport has raised questions about BJP’s tendency to use its political clout to flout laws.
 
 BJP Goa president Vinay Tendulkar defended the public meeting at the airport terming it a “spontaneous gathering of people” but given the elaborate arrangements made, the Congress wasn’t convinced.
