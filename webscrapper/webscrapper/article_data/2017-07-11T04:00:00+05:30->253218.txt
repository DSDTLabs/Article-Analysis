New Delhi: Reducing the   rate on   to nil, will result in complete denial of   ( ) to domestic manufacturers of sanitary napkins and  , the finance ministry has said. “This will make domestically manufactured sanitary napkins at a huge dis-advantage vis-a-vis imports, which will be zero rated,” it said while justifying the GST rate on sanitary napkins.

 It said that the tax incidence on this item before and after GST is the same or less. “In pre-GST, they attracted concessional excise duty of 6% and 5%   and, the pre-GST estimated total tax incidence on sanitary napkins was 13.68%. Therefore, 12% GST rate had been provided for sanitary napkin,” the ministry said. Providing specific examples, the ministry said as raw materials for manufacture of sanitary napkins attract GST of 18% of 12%, even with 12% GST on sanitary napkins, there in an inversion in the GST structure.
 
 “Though, within the existing GST law such accumulated ITC will be refunded, it will have associated financial costs [interest burden] and administrative cost, putting them at a dis-advantage vis-à-vis imports, which will also attract 12% IGST on their imports, with no additional financial costs on account of fund blockage and associated administrative cost of refunds,” it said.
 
 The ministry said that if the GST rate on sanitary napkins were to be reduced from 12% to 5%, it will further accentuate the tax inversion and result in even higher accumulated ITC, with correspondingly higher finical costs on account of fund blockage and associated administrative cost of refunds, putting domestic manufacturers at even greater dis-advantage with regard to imports.
 
 The ministry was reacting to comments on the issue of GST rates on sanitary napkins.
