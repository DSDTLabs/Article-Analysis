PATNA: Prison reform is badly required across the country as the prevailing system makes jails a place for punishment rather than reform, said   while launching the book ‘Jail’ by   alias   here on Wednesday. The book is about the MP’s experience in jail and how inmates are treated there.   is convener of Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik).

 “In India and some other countries, prisons earlier used to be a place where inmates were given a chance to reform themselves. However, situation has drastically changed and now prisons have become a place where inmates are kept confined with the motive of punishment only,” Mandal said.
 
 Mandal also said people and politicians must analyse the country’s achievements in the last 70 years after independence. “Children still die just because of diarrhoea,” he said and added, “Democracy is almost failing us. It is up to the political leaders to deliver for the people and the country.”
 
 Pappu advocated for separate jails for those who are behind bars for petty crimes. Pappu’s wife and   MP Ranjeet Ranjan, Swami Agnivesh, Akhlakh Ahmed, Archana Rajhans and several others were also present on the occasion.
