AGRA: To ensure foolproof security to the  , a world heritage site, the district administration has ordered that, from now on, only locals with valid identity proof will be allowed entry to the monument complex to offer   namaz on Fridays. 

 People entering the premises of the Taj for offering prayers on Fridays will have to carry identity cards to prove that they are residents of Agra. The Taj Mahal remains closed for tourists on Fridays. The administration’s move comes following complaints that “outsiders”, including Bangladeshis and non-Indians”, enter the Taj Mahal complex on Fridays on the pretext of offering namaz. 
 
 The order also states that the district magistrate should be immediately informed in case any outsider tries to enter the mosque. The order issued by additional district magistrate (city) K P Singh also states that entry of ‘outsiders’ can adversely affect the security of the monument. Agra district magistrate   said, “Now, we will allow only residents of Agra city to offer namaz at the mosque located inside the Taj Mahal complex.” 
 
 Similar orders were issued in 2013 by the Archaeological Survey of India but these were not enforced properly, said an official.
