Mysuru: Nidumamidi Mutt seer Veerabhadra Channamalla swami opined that country’s democracy will be under threat and it will shift to   administration under Prime Minister Narendra Modi if BJP manages to win all the five states that are going for polls. 

 Speaking after inaugurating the 10th district conference of All India Trade Union here on Sunday, the seer, said that   is a dictator and fascist. The demonetization of higher currency notes is an indication that the country is heading towards becoming a fascist nation. Due to note ban, nearly 90 percent of people in the country were made to suffer. It also created an artificial scarcity of notes, he added. 
 
 “Only PM is alone ruling the country. He did not even consult the finance minister before announcing demonetization which resulted in the death of several people standing in queues before banks to withdraw their hard earned money. Modi did not even apologize to their families,’’ he said. 
 
 Stating that the opposition parties have become too weak before BJP, the seer, said that the people of India will not accept Rahul Gandhi as PM. Fearing that senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee may rise as a strong contender for the PM post and pose problem for Rahul Gandhi in future, the high command made him (Pranab) President, he said.
 
 CPI national council member Siddanagouda Patil, AITUC president H V Ananth Subbarao, and others were present.
