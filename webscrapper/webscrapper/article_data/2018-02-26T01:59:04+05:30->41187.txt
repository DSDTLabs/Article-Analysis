NEW DELHI: The   has appreciated the efforts made by the AAP government in ensuring children get enrolled in schools run by it.

 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar refused to issue any directions on a PIL making a general complaint that hundreds of children in the age groups of 6-14 years were denied admission to government schools in Delhi.
 
 Going by the documents filed by the government highlighting its efforts to enroll as many school going children as possible, HC said the government “is conscious of its constitutional and statutory duty to ensure that all children of school going age are ensured admissions to government schools in Delhi and are working towards this end.”
 
 The court also took note of the two circulars issued by directorate of education to note that the these provisions “manifest that every effort is being made to ensure that no child is deprived of education on account of red-tapism and inability to complete formalities.”
 
 In the process, HC disposed of a plea, filed by an NGO, alleging that children were denied admission by government schools due to their failure to produce residence proof or transfer certificates from previous school, report cards, etc.
 
 Appearing for DoE, standing counsel Naushad Ahmed said that the department had verified details of the children identified by the NGO and they had been granted admission.
 
 In addition, the DoE said, to make sure that children are not deprived of education, it has also issued a circular mandating that no school will deny admission to any specially abled, destitute child or refugees/asylum seeker, homeless, migrant, orphan or a child in need of care due to the non-availability of essential documents at the time of admission.
 
 It further assured the court that another circular has been issued specifying that admission would be provided in the ‘age appropriate class’ throughout the year to students up to the age of 14 years and no student/child can be refused admission on the ground that he/she has not furnished their Aadhaar card.
