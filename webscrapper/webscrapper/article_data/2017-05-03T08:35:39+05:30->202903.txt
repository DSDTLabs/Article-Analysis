JODHPUR: Barely two weeks after making a public appearance, close aide of former chief minister Ashok Gehlot and former chairman of the Jodhpur Development Authority (JDA)   was arrested by the Anti Corruption Bureau(ACB) on Tuesday afternoon in cases of irregularities in JDA.

 The ACB arrested him immediately after the   stayed the anticipatory bail order to him by the Rajasthan High Court.
 
 Confirming the arrest, SP (ACB) Ajay Pal Lamba said that the SC admitted the petition of ACB challenging the anticipatory bail order by the high court and stayed this order. Lamba said that this is the 11th arrest in the cases of irregularities in JDA.
 
 The ACB had filed four cases against Solanki for alleged irregularities in various developmental works in 2013 for violating the rules pertaining to administrative and financial sanctions and increasing the financial sanction of some works as well as changing the location of the sanctioned works.
 
 Lamba said that out of these four cases against him, Solanki has been arrested in one particular case, wherein double tenders were invited for the same work at a location in Mansagar area, for construction of a community hall.
 
 “A tender worth Rs 25 lakh was invited in 2012-13 for the construction of a community hall in Mansagar’s Adarsh Colony and despite this, the JDA issued a second tender worth Rs 70 lakh for the same work in 2013-14,” said Lamba. Solanki had been absconding apprehending arrest by the ACB while also trying to get the FIRs against him quashed by moving the high court.
 
 Solanki then moved the court with the plea of anticipatory bail after his earlier pleas were rejected.
 
 Solanki, however, succeeded in getting the anticipatory bail last month along with another absconding accused  , the then director (technical) and made a public appearance on April 22, where a large crowd of loyalists felicitated him.
