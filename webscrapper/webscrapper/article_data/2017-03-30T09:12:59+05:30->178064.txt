NEW DELHI: Two men have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a Gurgaon-based businessman for a Rs 2-crore ransom. 

  and Vijay Kumar had kept the businessman captive in a hotel in Karol Bagh from where the crime branch arrested them on Tuesday night, said DCP (crime) Madhur Verma. 
 
 Grewal and Kumar, both in the property business, suffered huge losses in the past four-five years and have been reeling under huge debt. "They were fond of lavish lifestyle, and were facing acute problems in fulfilling their daily needs. They were aware about the victim's financial position and were sure that he would shell out the ransom amount without involving the police," said Verma.
 
 A Haryana-based businessman, involved in road construction, approached the crime branch on Tuesday with a complaint that his partner had been kidnapped. The complainant knew Grewal, one of the accused, through a common friend. For the past few days, Grewal had been contacting him for help in getting a road tender from   (NHAI).
 
 The complainant and his partner came to Delhi to meet Grewal and his associate. They were taken to the hotel on the pretext of a meeting with a businessman but kidnapped them. "The complainant requested the accused that if they release him, he would bring the ransom amount," said Verma. Failing to arrange the ransom amount, he contacted the police . 
 
 A team led by ACP   was formed and the two accused were nabbed and the other businessman was rescued.
 
 A revolver along with 11 live cartridges, probably made in the Kanpur ordnance factory and issued in the name of Sunil, Grewal's brother-in-law, were found on them. A car has also been seized. 
 
 Kumar's father had retired as an airman from Indian Air Force.
