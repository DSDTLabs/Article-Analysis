MUMBAI: The city crime branch probing the alleged sex and drug racket   Sunkriti involving ‘cult guru’   Kulkarni, on Wednesday told a magistrate’s court that he had forged the signature of a girl who was among his followers on a cheque for Rs 15 lakh. Following the development, police have booked him under additional IPC sections of cheating, forgery and breach of trust.

 Police said they have found an MoU from Kulkarni’s Nagpur house. The MoU was between a Bhopal-based company and one of the Malad  , whose parents had filed a case against Kulkarni. “In the MoU, Kulkarni had promised the company to give a loan of Rs 23 crore. He had also forged her sign on a cheque and given it to the company,” said an officer. After the police told the girl about her cheque book being misused,she has now given her statement against Kulkarni. 
 
 Till now both the sisters, whose parents had approached the Bombay high court with a complaint accusing Kulkarni of influencing their daughters to leave home and join him, had been supporting him. The girls, in the past, had said that they did not want to live with their parents and had left to ‘join’ Kulkarni on their own as he supported them.
 
 Kulkarni was sent to judicial custody till May 16. The crime branch informed the court that they have found incriminating documents which show he had allegedly forged documents and signature of one of the girls on a cheque for Rs 15 lakh and had siphoned of Rs 5.5 lakh.
 
 Last week, police registered a case against Kulkarni for running an alleged sex and drugs racket and influencing the   couple’s daughters. Delhi police had told their Mumbai counterparts that Kulkarni was also involved in a cheque-bouncing case in 2004. “Besides, he had also tried to extort money from a Nagpur resident. Kulkarni had fake letterheads showing him to be a doctor. According to the remand application, two cheating cases have been filed against him in Nagpur too,” said a police officer.
