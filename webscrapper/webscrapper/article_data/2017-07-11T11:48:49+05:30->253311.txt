 Having lost vision in his right eye 10 years ago when he was hit by a cricket ball, Arun found his life miserable. Speaking to   on his way to Salur, a town located 89 km from the city, 42-year-old Arun said, “Leading life with vision in one eye is difficult. Since my optic nerve was damaged, the doctors said that I will not be able to get back my vision. I was recommended to not stress the other eye, else there could be vision problems in the future. Over the years, I managed to stand on my feet and earn money by hosting and anchoring shows. However, my only motive through my ride is to spread a word among people that donating eyes will enable the blind people to see the world and live a life.” 
 
 “Although I have been biking for several years now, this is the first time I am riding for a cause. The expenses for this trip is around Rs 50,000. I do not mind spending time and money, provided it is for a cause,” said the biker, who now runs his own event management company. Riding his Royal Enfield Himalayan, Arun intends to complete his journey in 20 days via Rajnandgaon, Jhansi, Delhi, Manali, Rohtang, Jispa, and   lake.
