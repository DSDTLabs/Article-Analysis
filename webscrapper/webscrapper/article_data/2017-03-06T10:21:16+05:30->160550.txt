MALHNI (JAUNPUR): Having limited his campaigning for members of the   parivar till now,   patriarch   Yadav on Sunday, for the first time, addressed an election rally for a candidate outside the family. 

 Mulayam campaigned for Malhni assembly seat candidate Parasnath Yadav in Jaunpur.
 
 In a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mulayam said he was a ‘thug’ (conman) and a ‘liar’. He asked people to be wary of the “tactics of BJP”, which had now become “Bharatiya Jumla Party”.
 
 “He (Narendra Modi) is not only a ‘thug’ (conman), but he also lied to the people to form his government. You all should be wary of him and his party now,” said Yadav.
 
 Mulayam said his party did what it said. 
 
 “We have fulfilled our promises. Whenever there is any incident of high handedness against people, our party has been with them and will always remain there,” he said, adding that after forming the government, his party would fulfil all promises made in its manifesto.”
 
 Saying that SP ensured safety for women and girls, he addressed women to first vote and then light the stove on the polling day.
 
 The SP patriarch also mocked the Prime Minister for his promise of Rs 15 lakh refund to people after getting back black money stashed in foreign accounts and providing jobs to 2 crore people.
 
 Mulayam claimed the SP government had given the maximum number of jobs to the youth and the ones who could not get jobs were given unemployment allowances.
 
 He did not speak about any other political party or his son chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.
 
 SP leader Azam Khan, who shared the stage with Mulayam, also attacked the BJP, RSS and Modi.
 
 “Hindus and Muslims are like two eyes of a beautiful woman. We have to remain united to fight killers of Gandhi,” he said.
 
 Mocking the PM, he said, “How will a person who cannot secure a home for his wife ensure safety of daughters of the country,” Azam said.
