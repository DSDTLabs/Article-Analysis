MUMBAI: A day after the cabinet decided to hike the   on conveyance and gift deeds,   president Uddhav Thackeray prompted his ministers to oppose it.

 Ramdas Kadam, a minister from the Shiv Sena, wrote to CM Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday and demanded a rollback, saying failure to do so would invite an agitation.
 
 The government on Tuesday decided to amend the act on stamp duty so that it would be able to charge 3% of the Ready Reckoner rates of the land if a flat is gifted to a blood relation. Today the stamp duty is Rs 200 to Rs 500, depending on the nature of the plot. 
 
 It was decided to raise the stamp duty on conveyance deeds in rural area to 4% from 3% of the land rate, and in peri-urban areas governed by municipal councils to 5% from 4%.
 
 The decision by the cabinet was taken in the presence of Shiv Sena ministers Ramdas Kadam and Diwakar Raote at a meeting in Mantralaya. On why the Shiv Sena had not opposed the move during the meeting, Kadam said he had not been able to read the cabinet note before the meeting. 
 
 “On Monday, we were on the visit to Akola as part of ‘Shiv Sampark Abhiyan’ and reached the city late, attending the cabinet meet on Tuesday morning at 11 am,” he said. “So we could not study the cabinet note, which came a day before.”
 
 He also said water conservation minister Ram Shinde should resign if he could not see any corruption in the Jalyukta Shivar scheme.
