NEW DELHI: In 2017,   finished sixth on the points table with six wins from 14 games. Once again, it was a disappointing result from yet another Daredevils squad bristling with talent on paper but lacking direction and consistency. 
 
 
 
 
 
 All that could change with a rejigged squad and a new captain in the shrewd  , with plenty of batting firepower added ahead of the 11th season of the IPL. Daredevils have perennially been laggards in the IPL, but there is new hope from the franchise after some smart spending at this year’s player auction. 
 
 
 Gautam Gambhir
 
 Gambhir, who led   to two IPL titles, has returned to his first franchise as captain. He is credited with turning around KKR’s fortunes with his innovative captaincy, crucial batting and selection of certain uncapped Indian and experienced overseas players, and is the franchise’s leading run-getter with 3345 in 122 matches. 
 
 
 Ricky Ponting
 The Australian legend has taken over for the 2018 season, having previously coached Mumbai Indians to the IPL title in 2015 during a two-year stint. Ponting takes over from Paddy Upton. 
 
 
 
 
 1 Colin Munro, 2 Shreyas Iyer, 3 Gautam Gambhir (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Rishabh Pant (wk), 6 Rahul Tewatia, 7 Chris Morris, 8 Amit Mishra, 9 Mohammed Shami, 10 Trent Boult, 11 Harshal Patel
 
 
 A squad featuring the batting might of Colin Munro, Glenn Maxwell, Jason Roy, Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer and Gambhir, with Chris Morris down the order, gives Daredevils hope of challenging all bowling attacks. How they will fit in these players is the challenge, but given the duration of the tournament there is every chance that each of the overseas batsmen will feature at some point. The bowling is reliant on Morris, Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Mohammed Shami, Amit Mishra and Harshal Patel, and it will be interesting to see which of Boult and Rabada get more playing time. 
 
  
  
 
 
 2008 - semis; 2009 - semis; 2010- fifth place; 2011- tenth place; 2012 – play-offs; 2013 – ninth place; 2014- eighth place; 2015 – seventh place; 2016 - sixth place; 2017 - sixth place.
 
 
 If the batting can live upto its reputation and the bowlers - particularly the spinners - remain penetrative and consistent to support a very good pace attack, expect Daredevils to reach the knockouts.
