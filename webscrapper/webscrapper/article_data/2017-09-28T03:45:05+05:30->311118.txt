VARANASI: Under fire for his allegedly offensive comments to a girl student, the   (BHU) chief proctor   resigned from his post late on Tuesday night, even as protests continued on Wednesday after police baton charged students demanding justice for one of them molested on the campus last week.

 Girl students had claimed that the proctor, when approached for help by the distraught victim, had allegedly told her to “leave if she did not want to get raped there.” Beleaguered BHU vicechancellor G C Tripathi, however, put a question mark on investigations by the UP government and the district administration that said that timely action could have prevented the situation from deteriorating to a point that led to arson and violence on the campus. The VC claimed that the high-powered committee under retired high court judge Justice V K Dixit, which he had constituted, would “reveal the truth” about the incidents on the campus between September 21 and 24.
 
 Tripathi got support from a religious group with RSS ideology, which blamed “leftists” for the BHU crisis.
 
 “We are going to meet members of the sant samaj (seer community), intellectuals, academics and representatives of various organisations on September 30 (at the math in Narharipur) to discuss the issues that triggered the unfortunate incidents in the BHU, and find out corrective solutions,” Mahant of Patalpuri Math Balak Das said. “The BHU incident is a conspiracy and handiwork of leftists to defame the great institution established by Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya,” he added.
