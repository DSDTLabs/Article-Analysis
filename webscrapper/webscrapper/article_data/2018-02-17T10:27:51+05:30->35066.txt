KOLHAPUR: The investigation into the murder of veteran activist   is moving on the right track and new things are coming to light, special inspector general Vishwas Nangre-Patil said here on Thursday.

 The officer, however, refused to divulge details in the case investigation. “The investigation is moving in the right direction. Upper Police superintendent Tirupati Kakade has increased the speed of the probe and important clues are coming forth.” he said. 
 
 “Accordingly, we have submitted a report two days ago in the Bombay high court. A special drive is under way to nab the absconding suspects, Vinay Pawar and Sarang Akolkar. The team is going to find the mastermind soon,” said Nangre-Patil. 
 
 A meeting of senior police officers of the   range, north Karnataka and Goa, was held in Kolhapur on Friday afternoon. Discussions were held on various inter-state crimes. 
 
 Pansare was shot in Kolhapur on February 16, 2015 and succumbed to his injuries four days later. Recently, the district and sessions court granted bail to Virendrasinh Tawade, the second accused in the case. The first accused, Sameer Gaikwad, has already been granted bail. The state government has formed a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate the case. 
 
 Progressive outfits and left parties organised demonstrations outside the collector’s office on January 20. Pansare’s relatives have accused the state government of not taking the case seriously and transferring the investigation officers frequently. 
 
 Pansare’s daugther-in-law, Megha, who is a petitioner in the high court, said, “Three years is a long duration. We are hearing that the investigation is on the right track for many months. Police have lost the initial crucial period by carrying out a shoddy investigation. Now, police have claimed in the the high court that they have located more number of people in the case. However, already many are absconding.”
