LUCKNOW: Stepping up its Dalit outreach, the   government at Centre has decided to provide subsidised foodgrain to SC/ST and OBC students living in hostels meant for backward classes. 

 Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution,   said on Thursday that around 15 kg of foodgrain would be provided at subsidised rates to backward class students like in case of below poverty line (BPL) category people.
 
 Paswan's announcement comes days before Karnataka assembly elections and byelections in some states, including UP. 
 
 The president of Lok Janshakti Party, an NDA ally, said that his party had filed a review petition in   on dilution of SC/ST Act. 
 
 He said that the NDA government has also filed a review petition and it may even bring an ordinance to provide reservation in promotions for SCs and STs. 
 
 He said that his party supports reservation for economically poor upper caste people.
 
 Rubbishing all opposition claims of reservation provisions for Dalits being under threat, Paswan said that it was only NDA government which was sincere about Dalit welfare.
 
 He attacked BSP chief Mayawati for playing politics over Dalit votes by accusing the Centre of conspiring to dilute the SC/ST Act. "It was rather during her government in UP that the SC/ST Act got diluted," he said.
 
 Paswan's stand comes a day after he ruled out the possibility of any new political realignment ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. 
 
 Earlier, he had trashed speculations of him quitting the NDA to join opposition camp. Paswan has also maintained that there was no alternative to PM Narendra Modi and the opposition was disunited to take on the mighty BJP.
 
 Referring to the controversy over Mohammad Ali Jinnah's portrait in Aligarh Muslim University, 
 
 Paswan said that Jinnah demanded a separate Pakistan unlike Ambedkar who sought special constitutional provisions for SCs and STs.
