PANAJI: The prevailing weather conditions in the state may have an adverse impact on fisheries. Owing to the depression in the  , some boats are still stranded at sea. And with the sudden downpour that was mainly witnessed in several parts of the state, farmers are also concerned about the fate of their cashew and mango crops.

 Scheduled to bear fruit within a few months, the cashew and mango trees have already flowered in orchards across the state. However, with the dull and damp weather, the fear of crop damage is giving farmers sleepless nights. 
 
 “If the dull weather persists for two to three days, there is a likelihood of fungus infecting cashew and mango flowers,” said a farmer from Bicholim, Rohan Joshi.
 
 “Many boats are still stuck on the high seas,” said the director of Mandovi Fishermen Marketing Cooperative Society Limited, Francisco  . 
 “ There were no casualties or losses reported. However, we are constantly in touch with the fishermen to ascertain their well-being,” he said.
 
 At Vasco jetty, fishermen from both Goa and beyond took precautions and kept their vessels anchored.
 
 “Besides boats of Goan fishermen, boats from Kerala and Tamil Nadu were also anchored at Vasco jetty following the port warning to fishing vessels. We provided them with drinking water and ice to preserve their fish catch,” said chairman of  , Augusto Fernandes.
 
 Owing to this development, fish vendors in the local market are skeptical about conducting adequate sales in the coming days.
