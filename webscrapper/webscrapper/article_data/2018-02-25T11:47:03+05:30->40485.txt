VISAKHAPATNAM: Charting   Pradesh’s tremendous success since bifurcation, the state’s IT minister,  , on Saturday said how it has been made possible solely because of the vision of one man – N Chandrababu Naidu.

 “At the time of bifurcation in 2014, we were a capital-less state. Our per capita income was among the lowest in south India. But under the able leadership of our CM we have seen a 15% year-on-year growth,” Lokesh said reiterating Naidu’s vision of turning AP into the most sought-after destination for global investments in India, by 2050.
 
 Citing the example of Cyberabad that, he said, has “today come to be known for its services sector”, the minister stressed how it was “one man’s vision that transformed sleepy city of Hyderabad” into what it is today.
 
 “Now he has embarked on a new journey — AP 2.0. The challenges are aplenty, but it is an exciting journey nonetheless. In the new state, we are focusing on cluster-based, decrentralised development,” Lokesh said pointing out how every part of AP – be in Visakhapatnam or the four districts of Rayalaseema that have historically been backward – have witnessed equal growth under the present government.
 
 Meanwhile, upholding the government’s mission for its new capital city, Lokesh said that the government is working on an accelerated pace to “turn Amaravati into one of the top five most liveable cities on this planet”. “It is shaping up into a hi-tech capital with a lot of intellectual property -based investment. It recently closed a deal with HCL too. It will be a world class city,” he added promising three important things in surplus to all investors – land, power and water.
