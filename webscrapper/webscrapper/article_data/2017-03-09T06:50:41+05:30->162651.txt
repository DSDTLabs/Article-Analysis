KOTTAYAM: The Supreme Court has passed a landmark ruling giving   to those who help   but nothing much seems to have changed with regards to public apathy towards such victims. Three youths died after the bike they were riding on crashed into a wall in Marangattupally on Tuesday. Local residents said timely medical care could have saved their lives as they lay bleeding on the road for more than half an hour. 

 Vinu Mathew Thomas (19) from Ranni, Lasther Fernando (19) from Kollam and Aswin Vishwanathan (20), also from Kollam, were second-year degree students of the   in Marangattupally. They were returning after watching a movie in Pala with a few other friends when the bike they were riding on lost control and crashed into a wall of a private compound. The impact was so strong that the bike crashed through the wall and hit a tree in the compound. 
 
 All three were thrown off from the bike and suffered serious injuries. The youths who were following them on other bikes and local residents who rushed to the spot were not able to get a vehicle to take them to a hospital. Many motorists sped away without stopping. Finally, a local resident who came in a car agreed to take Vinu, whose injuries were the most serious, to a hospital. The other two were taken to the   in a private bus.
 
 Vinu succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday while Lasther and Aswin died on Wednesday morning. The bodies were kept at the college and were later were taken to their respective homes.
