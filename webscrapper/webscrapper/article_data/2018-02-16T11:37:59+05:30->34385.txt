VIRUDHUNAGAR: Sleuths from the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) arrested two people, including a   (village administrative officer) for receiving Rs 4,000 as bribe to transfer his name in a patta document in Virudhunagar district on Thursday. The accused were identified as VAO, Sermakani, 50, and retired revenue inspector Jayaprakash, 60.

 Sources from the DVAC said that Krishnan, 24, from Palavanatham near Virudhunagar recently approached the   requesting the transfer of name. As she demanded bribe, he approached the DVAC office.
 
 As per instructions from the sleuths, he approached the VAO to hand over the cash laced with chemical. The officials asked Krishnan to give it to Jayaprakash. The DVAC team hiding at the   office, caught him red-handed. During inquiries he admitted that he received the money at the behest of the VAO. The two were produced before a judicial magistrate and lodged in prison.
 
 This is the second such incident in the same week in Virudhunagar district as two panchayat workers were arrested for receiving a bribe amount on Tuesday near Rajapalayam.
