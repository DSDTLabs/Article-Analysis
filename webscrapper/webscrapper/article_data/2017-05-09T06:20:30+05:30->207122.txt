AHMEDABAD: Another defence witness, Lata Mahesh Vyas alias Maqsuda Vohra, deposed before the special SIT court hearing the 2002   on Monday. 

 The witness told the court that her brother-in-law, Fulabhai Vyas, who is being prosecuted in this case, was unwell and confined to his home on the day of the rioting, February 28, 2002. She said Fulabhai is her husband’s elder brother. He had suffered a fracture in his right leg more than a week before the riots broke out. She and Fulabhai’s wife were attending to him during these days.
 
 In her cross-examination, she was asked whether she had revealed this information about Fulabhai at any forum before her appearance in court on Monday. She said that at the time of the arrest, officers of the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) were informed about this. Lat said that her marriage with Fulabhai’s younger brother Mahesh took place in 1993. As she was a Muslim, her family members were against her marriage. She later assumed a Hindu identity. In 2009, Vyas was appointed by the   as the Nava Naroda ward president. Lata was the fifth witness to depose in favour of accused persons. Before her, two Muslim witnesses told the court that an accused, Dinesh Patel, had provided them shelter on the day of the rioting. Two other witnesses, Rajesh and Bipin Thakkar, are likely to be examined on Tuesday.
 
 In this case, 11 persons were killed in Naroda Gam, and more than 80 persons are facing trial. They include former minister Maya Kodnani, VHP leader Jaideep Patel and   leader Babu Bajrangi.
