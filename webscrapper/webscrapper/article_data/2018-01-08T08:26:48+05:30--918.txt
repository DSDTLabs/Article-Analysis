JODHPUR: After 59   were found staying in one of the ashrams of self-styled godman   in Mount Abu during a search by the police and the   on December 23, yet another ashram of the saint has been found on   with 72 girls in it. 

 Claiming to have been living there for spiritual activities and education, the girls said they are staying here on their own will and there was no ill-treatment meted out to them, whatsoever, and they were also allowed to meet their guardians.
 
 SP (Sirohi) Om Prakash, however, said that it was a search by the police like in Mount Abu last month and nothing suspicious was found in this ashram.
 
 “We had received an information about stay of large number of girls in this ashram and sent a team for search. All the activities were found there to be satisfactory”, said the official. 
 
 SHO (Abu Road) Mithu Lal, who had led the search and said to have obtained relevant documents pertaining to the girls and ashram, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. 
 
 The ashram caretakers, however, had resisted the entry of police in the ashram citing the presence of the girls, after which, female police were sent in. 
 
 But interestingly, like in the case of Mount Abu, the Child Welfare Committee have not paid any visit to the ashram with the police to talk to the girls, most of whom are said to be minors.
