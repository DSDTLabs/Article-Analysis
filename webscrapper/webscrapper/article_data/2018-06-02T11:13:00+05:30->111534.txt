TRICHY: T Muthukrishnan, fondly called  , started selling filter   in 1989. At that time, he was ridiculed by many around him saying that his business would ultimately fail. They questioned him whether a standalone shop selling only coffee would succeed like other eateries nearby which also sold coffee.

 
 But Murali was not deterred and was determined to make it big. Three decades later, his coffee shop, situated opposite the Rajagopuram in  , is one of the hot-spots in the city – despite the shop not even having a name board.
 
 Murali, now 55, stated that his grandfather and his father had ventured into the food business, but they had to close down eventually after incurring losses. “When I started my coffee shop in 1989, I took it personally when many people made fun of my coffee shop and said that even mine would be a failure. I wanted to prove them wrong,” he said.
 
 His success lies in his research about coffee and zeroing in on a process which made his filter coffee stand apart from the rest. “I don’t have any secret per se. I just found the right combination to make coffee which would impress all kinds of people,” he said. 
 
 A cup of coffee at his shop is available for Rs 15. His shop is open from 4am to 10.30am in the mornings and 2pm to 7.30pm in the evenings.
 
 Murali also proudly stated that his shop is one place in   which is visited by all kinds of people. “A lot of VIPs – including politicians, businessmen and famed writers – are regular customers. Even many get coffee parcelled from my shop,” he said.
 
 The Srirangam resident also mentioned that many people, who were impressed with the coffee, suggested him to open more outlets in the city and other cities. “A few people from Coimbatore and Chennai said that they would give me enough support if I started branches in their cities. My son is in college now, once he graduates I will ask him if he wants to expand my business,” Murali said.
