CHENNAI: A 26-year-old police constable guarding the memorial of former chief minister   on the Marina shot himself dead early on Sunday morning.

 Armed reserve police constable  , 26, from Perungudi in Madurai, killed himself when he was about to complete his night shift. He was part of a team of four constables guarding the memorial site with .303 bolt action rifles.
 
 Around 4.55am, the other constables heard the sound of gunfire from the right side of the memorial where Arunraj stood. They ran there and found him in a pool of blood.
 Arunraj had shot himself underneath the jaw, with the bullet piercing through his head and coming out. He was rushed to the Government   where he was declared dead, following which an autopsy was carried out.
 
 City police commissioner A K  , who visited the memorial, has ordered a detailed probe. Arunraj’s body was handed over to his family members later in the day.
 
 Police are checking Arunraj’s call records and questioning his friends to ascertain the reason for the suicide. He has not left behind any suicide note, police officials said.
 
 Preliminary investigations revealed that on July 13, 2015, Arunraj had gone missing from duty, and a case was registered against him at the Triplicane police station.
 
 He was later traced to Tiruvannamalai. Speaking to TOI, Arunraj’s father said his son had gone to the Tiruvannamalai temple to take a break from work as he was finding the job stressful at that time.
  
 The police are planning to conduct a ballistic test and are waiting for his autopsy report. Twelve policemen in four-member teams guard the former chief minister’s memorial all through the day, said a senior police official.
 
 “Arunraj was a wellbehaved and sincere policeman who never complained of any work stress,” the official said. Arunraj is survived by his parents Malairajan and   and four elder brothers. The   police have registered a case and are investigating.
