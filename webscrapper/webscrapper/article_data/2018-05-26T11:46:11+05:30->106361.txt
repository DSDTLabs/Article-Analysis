PATNA: In its bid for the mass outreach to the intelligentsia, the state   has decided to hold a conclave of the city’s ‘prabuddha varg’ (intellectual sections) at Gyan Bhavan here on Sunday, besides arranging the mass hearing of the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcast of PM   at polling booths in the state the same day. 

 State BJP president Nityanand Rai said the two functions have been planned to celebrate the achievements of PM   in the last four years. BJP central leadership has directed all the state units to organize programmes from Saturday up to June 11 to celebrate the achievements of PM Modi.
 
 Rai said   ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and   would participate in the conclave of the intelligentsia. BJP ministers in the state, including deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, Prem Kumar, Nand Kishore Yadav and  , would also speak on the occasion.
 
 On Sunday, all the ‘shakti kendras’ formed by the party at the polling booths in the state would also see congregations of people, including members of the booth level committees, to hear the PM’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcast from 11am to 11.30am.
 
 The state has over 62,000 polling booths. The state BJP has formed 42,000 booth level committees comprising around 20 members each, party sources said, adding the central leadership has asked the state unit to expand the shakti kendras by covering more booths.
 
 Also, the party has nominated ‘vistaraks’ entrusting them with the task of coordinating between the block and Shakti Kendras or booth-level committees, apart from reaching out, and roping in the respectable sections of society at the local level in the interest of the party.
