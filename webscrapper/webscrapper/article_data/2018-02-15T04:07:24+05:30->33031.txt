MUMBAI: A   (E) was duped of nearly Rs 2 lakh, apparently in a case of vishing between January 29-February 6. 

 Vishing is when scammers contact a target over the phone and extract personal information, usually on credit/debit cards, or trick the target into giving access to his computer.   police have registered a case of cheating.
 
 The 64-year-old complainant from Carter Road registered a police complaint on February 12.
 
 “The accused conned her into parting with her bank details. He used the details to swindle her,” said a police official.
 
 Officials said people rarely part with information of more than one bank account or card but senior citizens are vulnerable, as in this case.
