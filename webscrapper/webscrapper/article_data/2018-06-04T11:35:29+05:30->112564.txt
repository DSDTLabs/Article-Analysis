 All arrangements have been made to bring in the facility, under which commuters can recharge their passes through Paytm — an e-commerce payment system. 
 
 Operation manager of  , the firm which is handling the city bus service,   said, “A commuter can get a pass for Rs 270 from the city bus stand office. She, however, can redeem Rs 300 through it. The facility will be launched next week. Besides Paytm, payment can be made through cash too. But gradually we will shift to digital transactions.” 
 
 Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited manager   said, “We have been planing to start the facility after the bus service was rolled out in 2011. It will save the time of commuters as they need not pay cash to conductors and wait for change. A swipe of their pass will cut the process short.” 
 
 “The commuters will be issued passes every month. Conductors will enter passes in e-ticketing machine and issue tickets. The money will be deducted from the balance of the commuter. The system will be launched after its software is ready,” Jaskirat Singh added. 
 
 Sheenam Ahuja, an insurance firm employee who commutes by bus daily, said, “I board a bus from   to bus stand every day. Most of the times neither the conductor nor I have coins of smaller denomination and so, he expresses helplessness in returning the balance amount. The passes will make things easier and smoother.”
