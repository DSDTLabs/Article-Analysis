IMPHAL: Pro tem speaker V Hangkhalian on Sunday administered the oath of office to all 60 legislators who won in the just-concluded Manipur assembly polls. 

 Earlier, governor   swore in Hangkhalian as pro tem speaker. He was elected on a BJP ticket from the Kuki-Chin-Mizo-dominated Churachandpur constituency.
 
 Some BJP MLAs, who had been camping in Guwahati for the past few days, reached Imphal on Sunday morning to attend the swearing-in ceremony.
 
 On Monday, the ruling BJP-led coalition government will prove its strength on the floor of the house after the election of the speaker. The first budget session will start on Tuesday with the governor's address, the draft of which was approved by the first state cabinet convened on Friday.
 
 On the other hand, various civil bodies and NGOs have demanded that the BJP leadership, particularly chief minister  , fill up three vacant cabinet berths from among the MLAs of their respective constituencies and districts.
 
 So far, nine ministers have been inducted in the 12-member cabinet council. They include two from BJP, including the chief minister, four from National People's Party and one each from  , opposition Congress and Naga People's Front.
 
 Sources said BJP's  , the lone woman MLA in the coalition government, is likely to bag a cabinet berth. She won from the Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi seat.
