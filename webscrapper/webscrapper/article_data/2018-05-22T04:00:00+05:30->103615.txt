Rajkot: As the city continued to reel under extreme heat wave conditions for past three days with temperature hovering around between 42°C and 43°C, the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) commissioner Banchha Nidhi Pani issued a red alert on Monday. 

 “Pani has prepared a heat action plan for residents of Rajkot under which pedestrians will be given shelter, water and butter milk. Also, animals in Pradyumanpark Zoo are being protected from the heat with the help of water coolers and water showers. The herbivorous animals are being provided with fruits that have been frozen in the ice,” said an RMC official. 
 
 Pani has also issued an advisory to the citizens, appealing them to stay indoors between 1pm and 3pm, avoid tea, coffee or alcohol during this period, avoid fried, stale and high calorie food, and make maximum use of air conditioner, air cooler and fan to beat the heat.
