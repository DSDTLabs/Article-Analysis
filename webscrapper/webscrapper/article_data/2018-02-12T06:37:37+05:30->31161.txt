KOLKATA: Police on Sunday arrested   leader   immediately upon his arrival at the   for his alleged role in September 2017 case for attacking a police sub-inspector. Singh has been on the run ever since police implicated him for extortion in the CMRI ransacking case. He had even moved   seeking relief. 

 Singh's arrest came four days after the High Court sought the removal of the Investigating Officer (IO) probing the CMRI case. The court faulted the IO for infirmities in the case dairy and directed Singh to surrender his passport and cooperate with investigations. Singh's son Saheb claimed the court order insulated Rakesh from arrest in the case. Police refused to comment but made it clear that his arrest was made in a separate attempt to murder case where Singh's son had tried to run over a sub-inspector and constable while they tried to stop Singh from fleeing near his Orphangunge Road home.
