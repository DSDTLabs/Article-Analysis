GURUGRAM: Make sure your   always carries a ‘hazard’ signage. If it breaks down in the middle of the  , the district administration wants you to place the   behind the car and then call a mechanic. Otherwise, police will hold you responsible for any traffic snarl or accident on that stretch.

 The administration has asked motorists to put up the   some 30 metres behind their vehicle in case of a breakdown or a flat tyre on city roads to alert other motorists. The aim is to avoid congestion as well as stave off any possible collision, officials said.
 
 The decision was taken by Gurgaon deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh at a recent road safety committee meeting in the city.
 
 “It is advisable and required by the law. It is not just to avoid snarls but also to ensure other motorists don’t hit the stationary vehicle,” Pradeep Dahiya, Gurgaon’s additional deputy commissioner and in-charge of regional transport authority, told TOI on Saturday.
 
 The deputy commissioner has also ordered the highway authorities to ensure closure of all illegal cuts on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway near Khandsa village. Also to provide relief to hundreds of motorists, Singh has ordered the opening of the U-turn under the Hero Honda Chowk flyover within a month.
 
 Officials said they were also asked to get a detailed study done on the signage required to be put up at various points in the city to curb accidents. Some of the stretches that are in bad shape include Palam Vihar crossing, Bhaktawar Road, Sheetla Mata Road and Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road.
 
 Moreover, CNG stations will have to ensure that no traffic jam is caused by vehicles waiting in queue for refuelling. “The long queues outside the CNG refilling stations often lead to congestion on the road, thus affecting the mobility in the area,” said an official.
