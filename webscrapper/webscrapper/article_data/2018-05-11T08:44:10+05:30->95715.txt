 got their campaign back on track with a fine win over the Kings XI Punjab. Having lost to them just a couple of days earlier they would have been a touch nervous but despite KL Rahul's excellent batting they held their own to win. 

 
 
 
 
 They now have another mountain to climb against the red hot or is it bright yellow   if they play with the same positivity that they displayed against the Punjab team then they could spring another surprise.
 
 
 
 
 Their batting hasn't quite fired and they haven't had a good finisher and that's why they haven't quite got the scores that they should have.
 
  hasn't made the impact he did last year and that's understandable since he was out of top cricket for quite a while and got back a little over a month ago. He still is the guy the opposition fears the most because class is class and he can get form back anytime. 
 
  
  
 
  is rebelling in the opening batting position and is giving the brisk starts but he is not quite getting the support from the others. Jofra Archer has shown what a talent he is as a bowler but has disappointed as a batsman so far.
 
 Chennai have had a bit of a break which must be good news for   who has had a troublesome back, not that a niggle is ever going to stop him from turning up for his favourite team. He has silenced his doubters with his awesome finishing and winning games off his own bat. 
 
 On form it could be a one-sided match with Chennai winning easily but this is T20 and Rajasthan like Mumbai may just be starting to find the winning rhythm.
