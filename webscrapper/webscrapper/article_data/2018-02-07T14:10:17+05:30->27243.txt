COIMBATORE: Three days after   sleuths arrested Bharathiar University   A Ganapathi on graft charges, registrar of the University B Vanitha on Tuesday said that a committee would be formed to to run the institution.

 The   will constitute the   in two days, Vanitha told TOI. “The secretary of the higher education department will head it. At least two syndicate members will be a part of the committee, which will take care of the university's daily affairs till further decision is taken,” she said.
 
 “Usually, this procedure is followed when the term of a VC ends. The VC, who goes out, constitute the convener committee to take care of the affairs till a new VC is appointed. When the last VC’s term ended, a two-member committee was constituted,” Vanitha said.
 
 The absence of the vice-chancellor, however, has not affected the normal functioning, said university authorities. “Everyone is carrying on with their work. Only certain files that need the approval of the VC haven’t moved. But, no major decisions have been delayed because of the VC’s absence,” Vanitha revealed.
 
 Meanwhile, representatives of the   and Government-aided Colleges affiliated to the   held a demonstration in the city on Tuesday. “There is a deeper rot in the institutions of higher education in the state. All the senior posts in the university have now become payment posts. This has to be rooted out,” said president of the   Government College Teachers Association T Veeramani.
