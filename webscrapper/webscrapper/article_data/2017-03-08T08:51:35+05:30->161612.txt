AJMER: A 17-year-old girl has given a complaint to   that her   were forcing her into marriage.

 Dressed in school uniform and accompanied by her father, a labourer, Seema (name changed) reached the SP office on Tuesday morning.
 
 Last year, having scored more than 70% in Class X examination, she was presented with a laptop by the state government. 
 
 “I want to study further,” she says as tears well up in her eyes. Seema, a resident of Amargarh village of Masuda block in the district, nurtures a dream to become a teacher.
 
 But her mother wants to marry her off at the earliest. Her maternal uncles have convinced her mother that Seema is the right age for marriage and that the boy’s family is willing to give Rs 50,000 for her.
 
 “My father fears saying anything against my mother. But he privately supports me for pursuing higher studies,” she added. 
 
 She even threatened to commit suicide if she is made to discontinue her studies. “Whenever my father tries to persuade my mother, she threatens to have him locked-up in jail,” she said.
 
 Seema’s relatives said that it is common in their area to get girls married in the teens. “No girl in our village studies more than eight or tenth class,” said a relative of Seema’s mother. 
 
 Meanwhile, SP Blaggan has provided security to Seema and asked officials to investigate the matter. 
 
 State minister for child and women development Anita Bhadel said that it is a serious matter. “I have asked police officials to act speedily on the issue,” she said.
