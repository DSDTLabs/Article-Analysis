RANCHI: The state’s maiden  ,  , in February may have fetched the   government investment assurances to the tune of Rs 3 lakh crore, but industries back home are miffed over the state’s apathy towards them. 

 Entrepreneurs from food processing, mining, stone crushing and other sectors said the state government’s target-specific industrial policies are not making adequate impact at the grassroots level due to the lack of proper implementation. 
 
 At a deliberation session organised by the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) on Sunday, entrepreneurs from micro, small and medium enterprises ( ) sector raised their concerns in front of state secretary for industries, mines and geology Sunil Kumar Burnwal, energy secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni and principal secretary to the CM  . 
 
 The repeated amendments to the value added tax (VAT), introduction of stones (used for stone chip manufacturing) into major mineral category and the absence of time-bound disposal of environmental clearances remains a major concern of the state’s entrepreneurs. 
 
 Vikas Modi, former president of FJCCI, accused the government of excluding local industrialists in policy-making process. “We do not know what the government thinks. When we go to the department with our concerns, we are made to wait for hours,” Modi said. Burnwal claimed that the discontent among the entrepreneurs is due to lack of communication.
