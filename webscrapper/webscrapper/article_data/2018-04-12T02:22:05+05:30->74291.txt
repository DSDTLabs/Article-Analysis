NAVI MUMBAI: The Navi Mumbai Metro project being executed by   for connecting the city to the upcoming international airport has run into fresh trouble. 

 Metro line I, first of the four lines for building connectivity to the airport, has already been delayed since it was conceived 2011, but now there is fresh trouble with a consortium tasked with developing five of the 11 stations in line I, which connects Belapur suburban railway station to Pendhar (11.1km). This, sources said, has raised doubts if the revised deadline for the project for May 2019 will be met.
 
 
  
 Cidco terminated the consortium last December and re-tendered the work this January, but having got no response the town planning body recalled the tender and split the work of five stations into three packages. The   were re-floated on April 3. 
  
 Additional chief engineer (metro I), K M   said, “It is a global tender and three parties will be selected so that the work gets done faster. We have pegged the trial run in May 2019.” But, due to work getting stalled for the entire stretch of 11 stations, the actual commissioning could take few more months.
 
 Cidco MD Bhushan Gagrani told TOI, “The contractors, who were given the work, have caused enormous waste of time and money. Cancelling a tender and re-tendering involves time and there were court issues too.” The MD was dismissive about metro connectivity to airport with three more lines. “Well, we are still stuck with line I.” Cidco has forwarded to the government land acquisition for line III, a loop line connecting line I and line II. The Cidco board has given an approval of Rs 11,000 crore for the full project.
