CHARMINAR: Several historical monuments in the   are crying out for attention from the   (ASI). Despite several pleas, ASI officials and the government of   have done precious little to safeguard them.

 One such monument, the  , a two-story historical structure situated in a populated area is hugely neglected, say residents. It has been used many times for movie and serial shootings.
 
 “The ASI is not doing enough to protect such a beautiful structure. It seems that the twostoried historical monument is being used for only shooting purposes. Though many articles were written in different newspapers on this, and ASI officials were consulted time and again, and asked to come up with corrective imitative to protect the monuments or take alternate measures to safeguard this structure, no one has come here to see the reality of this monument, or do anything about this issue,” said Shukoor, one of the residents.
 
 Falling plaster, severe cracks and the pathetic condition of the floors, walls, and pillars pose a threat to the monument and to the people who come there to visit or shoot.
 
 “With the passage of time, looking at the structure, it seems like any portion of the wall or pillar may collapse. We have objected to film shooting but it is still continuing. The authorities concerned should take note of this issue seriously and ensure the protection of this monuments,’’ another resident   said.
 
 Some residents sad they expected a lot from the government for protection of such historical places in the Old City. But nothing is being done to make people proud of historical structures, and on the contrary, so many historical monuments in Old City may very well not be around in a hundred years.
