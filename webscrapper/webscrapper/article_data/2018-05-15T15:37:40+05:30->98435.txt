PATNA:   president   has cancelled Tuesday’s review meeting with party functionaries from all states, including  , in view of the announcement of results for Karnataka assembly elections.

 “Senior state BJP functionaries, led by the president of the party’s state unit Nityanand Rai, are in New Delhi to update Shah with the party’s organisational activities. However, the three-day review meet, which began on Monday, will not be held on Tuesday due to Karnataka assembly election results,” state BJP spokesman and former   Prem   said.
 
 The review meet convened by Shah, according to party insiders, is an exercise to gear up for the 2019 parliamentary elections. “We are always battle ready,” party’s state spokesman and former MLA Sanjay Singh Tiger said. 
 
 “The thrust of the review meet is on forming 19 or 20-member booth level committees. Shah will seek update on the programmes conducted in this regard so far,” Patel said.
 
 The state has 62,800 polling booths. Accordingly, if a booth has 20 members in its committee constituted by the BJP, the party will have to muster 12.56 lakh persons. So far, the party has constituted around 42,000 booth level committees.
