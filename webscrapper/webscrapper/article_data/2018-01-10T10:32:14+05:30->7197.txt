Physical activity has an undisputed role in keeping the heart healthy. In fact, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity-5 days a week or at least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least thrice a week to maintain good cardiovascular health. On a similar note, adequate   levels also seem to have an important role in indirectly warding off heart diseases. However the joint effect of these factors on the heart disease risk has not been investigated till date.

 A team of researchers therefore ascertained the link between physical activity and vitamin D (evaluated as 25-hydroxy vitamin D) in a cohort of 10342 people. The joint impact of physical activity and vitamin D on the heart disease or stroke risk was also evaluated. These people were free of any heart or   and had a mean age of 54 years when the study was initiated in the year 1987. Nearly 57% of the study participants were women and 21% were African-Americans. Relevant information for all study participants was updated and folio wed-up till year 2013 (nearly 20 years of follow-up).
 
 Appallingly, 30% of these people were deficient in vitamin D (25-hydroxy-vitamin D <20 mg/mL). Researchers found a positive correlation between physical activity and vitamin D levels, 
 in white population. Thus, 
  Such a relation was however not evident in African-American population. Further analysis revealed that
 No such benefits were observed in people who were deficient in vitamin D.
 
 It is now clear that physical activity is positively correlated with higher vitamin D levels in whites. Furthermore, physical activity and intermediate or optimal vitamin D levels seem to be synergistically beneficial in preventing cardiovascular diseases.
 
 So gear up! Make physical activity, optimal exposure to sunlight and well-balanced diet a part of your daily regimen. Take these initial steps and march towards a  .
