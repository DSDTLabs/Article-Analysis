BENGALURU: A 24-year-old daily-wage worker behaving suspciously at the   site at the Indian   station, Yelahanka, was arrested on Sunday. 

  Police recovered a mobile phone and nine SIM cards from the suspect, Mamnoon alias Maamu, who's from Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh. Police discovered he had clicked many pictures of the IAF station, where he was working as a welder. "Arond 9.30pm on Saturday, one of our staffers noticed that Mamnoon was talking over the mobile phone standing near Tower-9, a prohibited area. When we checked the list of his outgoing calls, we discovered he was speaking to someone in  ," said a complainant. 
 
 However, police ruled out Mamoon having any terror links and said it appeared to be an accident. "His family of around 12 members is working in the area and they all use one phone and different SIM cards. But yes, the pictures taken are illegal, and we have booked him under IPC Section 447 (trespassing)," a senior officer said.
 
 Police chief   also brushed away the terror angle and tweeted, "Please don't carry uninformed news. There is no terror angle at all....repeat no terror angle..an enquiry of a laborer."
