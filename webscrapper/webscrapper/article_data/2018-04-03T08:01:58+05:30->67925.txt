LUCKNOW: In light of the more than 400 arrests during the violence that erupted during the protests against a proposed review of the SC/ST Act, BSP Supremo   warned the government against harassment of dalits in the garb of maintaining law and order. 

 "While we are supporting the protest, I condemn the violence that took place and would appeal to the police and administration to take the strictest action against those perpetuating violence. However, I would like to warn them that dalits and adivasis who are fighting for their rights should not be made scapegoats for the anti-social and casteist elements who have indulged in violence. If this happens, my party will not sit quietly," she said.
 
 Accusing the Centre of having delayed in filing a review petition before the   over the proposed revision of the SC/ST Act, Mayawati said had it been done on time, dalits would not have had to take to the streets. She said: "Even though we are not represented in  , I would like to assure you that our struggle will continue and it will compel the   government to bend its knees, like it had to back off from its decision to forcefully acquire land from farmers."
