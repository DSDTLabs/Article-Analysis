 “The couple have children, but they bought the lemon for good health and prosperity,” said M Kanagasabesan, a village elder. The lemons used on the second and third day of the puja fetched Rs 6,000 each while the one used on Day Four went for Rs 5,800.
 
 Last year, the lemon from the first day fetched Rs 39,000, with the temple raising Rs 57,722 altogether. The Panguni Uthiram festival has been celebrated for several years at the temple, which is located at a place where two hillocks merge in the village. Kanagasabesan said the villagers were not aware when exactly the temple was established.
 
 “The temple became famous over a period of time. Forty years ago, the temple gave away the lemons used for the ritual free of cost but the demand for them led the management to begin auctioning them,” recalled the elder.
