Mumbai: A limestone   fell off the 119-year-old heritage J N   Institute in Fort due to a combination of factors that include ageing coupled with “heavy stormy wind and torrential rain”, said the general consultant for Mumbai Metro Line. It said that the incident cannot be linked to any construction-related activities, which would include drilling. It has instead recommended trimming tree branches near the   on the D N Road heritage mile and “temporary removal” of some external architectural features or decorative attachments during the Metro construction period. The ornamental piece that fell on the garden side on August 25 from a height of 10m weighs over 100 kg. 

 In a report dated September 4, Maple Consortium, the general consultant, found that the vibrations caused were of “0.8mm per second”. The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd had got the fallen finial investigated through Maple Consortium.
 
 Maple’s conclusion was that “deterioration of the existing grout between the minaret and its base support due to material ageing, wear and tear, heavy moisture and weathering,’’ “coupled with’’ with two possible factors did it. It could also be that the wind and “strong wind torrential rain may have caused a branch to break and fall towards the building façade which caused the collapse and damage to the minaret.’’
 
 The Trustees of Petit who have moved the Bombay HC with a plea to cease construction till a comprehensive structural survey is undertaken, had said the building had never suffered such damage.
