 Moments after a three-judge bench partially reviewed the court’s earlier order and directed Gopal Ansal to serve out the remaining part of his one-year jail term, a teary-eyed Krishnamoorthy told TOI, “Moneyed people appear to have some special right to get away lightly for their crimes in India. I have lost faith in the judiciary.
 
 “The   has deeply disappointed the kith and kin of victims of Uphaar tragedy. The verdict has murdered justice. It would have been better if I had picked up a gun 20 years ago to seek justice for my children. I would have served 14 years, by now would have been out of jail and in peace.”
 
 Krishnamoorthy and her husband Shekhar never gave up and fought all odds in a case that involved real estate tycoons Sushil and Gopal Ansal. 
 
 “I gave more than 20 years, the prime of my life, to fight to get justice for my children and other victims. And this is what I got,” said Krishnamoorthy.
