MUMBAI: A shorter link with   suburban railway   via a new   ( ) has led to a spurt in ridership at the Andheri   station by almost 20% since June.

 The FOB between the   station and the Metro station was opened in May. The older FOB, which still exists, would mean a walk of around 200 metres. Once the shorter route was established with the new FOB, the distance between the two stations reduced by 75 metres. “The average ridership per day before the opening of this route was 72,000. However, the ridership has increased by almost 20% to 85,924,” an MMRS spokesperson said.
 
 During the morning peak hour, the ridersip was 10,448 before the new FOB came up and has now increased by 21% to 12,556. The ridership has increased to 6,767 from 5,425, an increase of almost 25%, during the vening peak hour.
