HUBBALLI: Residents of   of Old Hubballi are deprived of basic facilities like proper roads, streetlights, water and sanitation. The situation has been the same since the past 15 years and residents' pleas to the authorities have fallen on deaf ears. 

 The Raja Kaluve that runs in the area emanates unbearable stench and poses health hazards. 
 
  "The drain has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The nala was damaged a month ago and filthy water is flowing out. But the authorities have taken no measures to repair it despite our repeated pleas," said Shahanaj Begam, a resident of the area. 
 
 There are no tar roads in the locality. Roads become slushy and slippery in the rainy season and people struggle to reach their homes dodging water-filled potholes. The area also lacks public transport. 
 
 Ramabai Thakur, another resident said that the   has not bothered to install proper streetlights in the area. There are one or two lights on some stretches but they are not maintained well. It is very dangerous to use the roads at late evenings and nights, she added. The stretch from   is especially dangerous where many cases of robbery get reported regularly, said  , a social worker. He added that he has been fighting for a government hospital and police outpost for SM Krishna Nagar since the past 15 years. 
 
 " But the authorities have not considered our demand though adequate place is available in the area. We have to go to KIMS or   for treatment, but we don't have any direct bus service from our area. The authorities must provide a good hospital in the area," he said.
