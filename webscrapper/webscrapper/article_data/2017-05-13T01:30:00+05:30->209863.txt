Hyderabad: Robust business from emerging markets and a reduction in expenses helped city-based pharma giant Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) post a 175.36% jump in net profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, but the lack of new product approvals in the US market proved to be a drag on its overall FY17 performance, pulling down the yearly net profit by 39.4%. On Friday,   reported a 175.36% rise in net profit for the fourth quarter of FY17 at Rs 337.60 crore as compared to a net profit of Rs 122.6 crore in the corresponding quarter of FY16, despite a 5.3% drop in total revenues during the quarter at Rs 3,498.50 crore from Rs 3,695.1 crore in the same quarter of last fiscal. On a yearly basis, DRL’s profit plunged 39.4% to Rs 1,292.1 crore in FY17 as against Rs 2,130.6 crore in FY16 on a 9% drop in total revenues at Rs 13,866.3 crore from Rs 15,247.5 crore in FY16. DRL co-chairman and CEO G V Prasad said, “FY17 has been a challenging year due to lack of new product approvals for the US market. However, our other geographies delivered good performances with several new product launches. We are also seeing expanded global access to our biosimilars as a result of successful registrations in emerging markets. We will continue our focus on rationalization of cost structures and building a sustainable quality culture across the organisation.” 

 Speaking about resolving the USFDA-related issues at its plants, Prasad told mediapersons that the company is working on addressing the issues at its two units – Duvvada at Visakhapatnam and plant-3 at Bachupally in Hyderabad. “We had a list of observations for the plant (Duvvada)... there were a significant number of observations and we are working on that...that is the plant that would require more effort. Our Bachupally plant was also inspected and there we had 11 observations, which we do not believe are very difficult to fix. We are in the process of responding to FDA with a comprehensive plan,” he said, adding that all over the world there has been increased scrutiny and expectations have been going up. “The US regulator has increased the level and rigour of inspections and expectations,” he added. DRL’s co-chairman pointed out that the market is becoming difficult, with a number of uncertainties in areas like price control as well as the GST implementation that might require significant readjustment of the distribution system. DRL’s president and chief financial officer Saumen Chakraborty pointed out that the pharma industry could face a temporary disruption in the area of stocking or invoicing as result of the impending GST rollout. On expectations from FY18, Prasad said, “We have gone through a significant period of lack of approvals. We can see some movement there ... some approvals have started coming and the outlook largely depends on the number of approvals that we get. It is critical for us to get approvals in the US market to drive growth in the next fiscal year…” Chakraborty added that the company expects around 10 new drug launches in the US market this fiscal. While pinning hopes on drug launches in the US market, he pointed out that the company has made good strides in the area of proprietary products. DRL has been focussing on niche therapies -- dermatology and neurology -- and while this is a sub $100 million revenue category, this business is expected to be “100s of millions of dollars” in the coming years, Prasad said. During FY17, the PSAI (Pharmaceuticals Services and Active Ingredients) revenues decreased to Rs 2,783.2 crore from Rs 2,843.7 crore in FY16, global generics revenues dipped to Rs 11,573.6 crore from Rs 12,833 crore and that from proprietary products increased to Rs 278.3 crore from Rs 265.9 crore.
