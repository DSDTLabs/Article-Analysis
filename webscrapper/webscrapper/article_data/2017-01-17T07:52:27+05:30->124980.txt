CHENNAI: There are less than three weeks to go for the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) 2017 and candidates are busy gearing up with mock exams and revisions.

 Experts say silly mistakes are what candidates need to avoid. The test, to be held on February 4 and 5 and February 11 and 12, is the gateway to various post-graduate programmes in the country. Conducted by seven IITs and Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore by turns, the exam this year is being organised by   Roorkee.
 
 Of the aptitude and core area sections, the first is where students can score high, say experts. Like any other paper, attempting questions you are confident of is the way to go, but there could be several lengthy questions that can be saved for later, they point out.
 
 Arvind Mantry, centre director, T.I.M.E., Chennai, says that while many candidates struggle with  . “Tension starts building up if many questions are left unanswered in the time frame. Don’t get stuck,” he says.
 
 Ideally, candidates should practise writing mock exams as many times as it takes to finish the paper in the given time limit. Also focus should be on analysing the mock papers, say most experts.
 
 “Over the years, the common errors that usually occur are silly conceptual mistakes, many times due to nervousness or the examination atmosphere. Application of the formulae is more important and not just memorising,” adds Mantry.
 
 This year, as many as 37 PSUs are recruiting using GATE scores, a higher number compared to previous years. Many PSUs used to conduct their own entrance tests. Since this is similar to the GATE exams, more PSUs have increasingly started taking GATE scores for their recruitment.
