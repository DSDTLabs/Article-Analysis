PANAJI: The North Goa Tourist   Owners’ Association hit out at the government on Wednesday for threatening to take action if they went ahead with the strike on January 19. 

 “The government appears to be apprehensive of the tourist taxi owners association. Or else, why are they nervous? We do not fear anyone. We are fighting for our rights. We have been facing harassment from the authorities. Even the hoteliers were invited for Wednesday’s meeting, including the   (TTAG). Let them do anything they want, but we will not back out,” said general secretary Vinayak Nanoskar.
