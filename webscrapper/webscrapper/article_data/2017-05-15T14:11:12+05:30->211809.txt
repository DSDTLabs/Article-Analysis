Politicians have turned politics into business. Some politicians misused my name and even made a lot of money out of it. Only god will decide my future. As of now, he is using me as an actor and I am acting. If he asks me to take up something, I will do it with the same responsibility. If a situation arises when I have to enter politics, I will not let some people close to me."
