BHUBANESWAR: Police have decided to give drunkards a chance to quit   instead of just imposing fine when they are caught causing nuisance, violence and committing offences. For this, the police have partnered with Alcoholics Anonymous, a noted voluntary organisation, to educate alcohol addicts about the harmful impact of the intoxicant.

 “We regularly detain drunkards either for causing nuisance, violence or committing offences. We will now inform their family members or guardians and refer the drunkards to Alcoholics Anonymous where they will get a chance to reform their bad habit,” commissioner of police Y B   said.
 
 Alcoholics Anonymous said it does not charge money from those, who are interested to recover from the habit. Most of the members of the organisation are former liquor addicts, who subsequently chucked drinking. “Unlike deaddiction centres, we do not give medicines. We give them hope and strength. Since we were liquor addicts, we will help the active drinkers to overcome their problem. We extend a helping hand to them,” said a member of Alcoholics Anonymous on condition of anonymity.
 
 Noted Mumbai-based psychiatrist  , who treats the liquor addicts at Alcoholics Anonymous, said a number of crimes, including domestic violence, are committed by people under the influence of alcohol. “We provide a 12-step recovery training programme to those, who approach us to get relief. They get a different feeling after regularly interacting with ex-addicts and their sufferings,”   said.
 
 Police said total 10,007 persons were caught and fined in Bhubaneswar for drinking in public places, mostly parks, roadsides and outside liquor outlets in 2017 as against 17,150 drunkards penalized in 2016. Police said massive enforcement drives and regular crackdown on drunkards led to a check in the offence. Last year, the commissionerate police roped in people of all hues, including Ollywood cine stars and organised a road run to dissuade youths from drug abuse.
