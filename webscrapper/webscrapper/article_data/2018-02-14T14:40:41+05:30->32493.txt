NAGPUR: Around 40 music lovers were in for a treat as Kavish  , an IIT graduate-turned-musician, presented his self-composed songs at a musical evening organized by Alag Angel on its   premises on Sunday.

 Seth sang numerous self-made songs on topics ranging from love, guilt, politics, empathy and others. The songs echoed the various emotions that define the feeling of compassion, solitude and happiness. “The event is conceptualized on the theme of ‘Hum’ — a word which signifies unity in individuality. The musical concept is about relationship of people with people and the subsequent dynamics. My songs are like a journey that I want people to come along with me and acknowledge the beauty of living a life,” said Seth.
 
 With pindrop silence, everyone listened to his beautiful poetry-cum-songs that everyone claimed they could resonate with. One of the songs he sang was ‘Bhura’ which discussed about the fascination of the world with the colour of the skin and not on the personality or the heart. Another song ‘Galat Salat’ spoke on the political scenario of the country and its impact on the youths of today. Met with an applause Seth added that the smart young generation is understanding the true meaning of love, friendship and politics and its significance in today’s world. Some other songs that he sang were ‘Malal’, ‘Nahin hai azaad’ and many more.
 
 Advising youngsters regarding following one’s passion, Seth added, “Passion accompanied with sustainability is the need of the hour and today the youth knows what they want to do and follows the same to a great extent. Anyone who is confused regarding his future, must listen to his heart but also bring along his brain.”
 
 Tanul Vikamshi, co-founder of Alag Angle, said, “Providing a non-judgemental, artistic and open for all platform is our main priority. The musical is part of our venture to promote the creativity among people, accompanied with some good soulful music.”
