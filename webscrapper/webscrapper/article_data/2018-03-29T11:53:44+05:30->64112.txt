GANDHINAGAR: The performance of profit making   (PSUs) was largely undermined by the poor show of loss making PSUs. This could be seen from the fact that out of total 77 PSUs, 54 earned cumulative profit of Rs 3,648 crore as against this 14 state firms posted losses of Rs 18,412 crore. As a result, the state ended 2016-17 with net loss of Rs 14,764 crore on   front.

 Analysing the investment and accumulated losses of these PSUs, the   report noted that 11 out of 77 working PSUs had registered an erosion in net worth, which was negative at Rs 13,278 crore at the end of March 2017.
 
 “Five of these 11 PSUs engaged in manufacturing sector had registered a negative net worth of Rs 9,829 crore at the end of March 2017. Net worth of the entire manufacturing sector comprising eight PSUs consequently eroded to Rs 5,862 crore,” the watchdog noted.
 
 Noting that the state government received only Rs 110 crore as dividend from 54 profit making PSUs in 2016-17, CAG report observed, “In view of negligible return (3.02%) from PSUs, the state government may consider formulation of a suitable dividend policy to be applicable to the state PSUs.”
 
 As of March 31, 2017, the state government’s investment in its companies stood at Rs 77,833 crore. The average return on investments in these entities was 0.21% on an average investment of Rs 62,744 crore during a period of 2012-17. As against this, the government paid an average Rs 7.68% as interest on its borrowing during the same period.
 
 The CAG advised the government to examine rationale for investment in high cost funds with low yields.
