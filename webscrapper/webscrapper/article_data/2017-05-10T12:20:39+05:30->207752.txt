PANAJI: Buddhists the world over will celebrate Buddha Purnima or vesak on Wednesday. The day, which marks the marks the birth anniversary of one of the world’s greatest spiritual teachers — Gautama Buddha, falls on the full moon day of the second month of the Hindu calendar, Vaishakh.

 Goa has played an important role in the maritime history of the sub-continent from the earliest times, with various archaeological remains bearing testimony of Goa’s overseas trade relations with distant lands. It is through this trade route and the monks that Buddhism reached Goa.
 
 Historians have seen some ruins of Buddhist establishments of the   sect dating to the pre-Christian era in Rivona, Lamgao, Priol and Colvale. A stone image of Buddha was discovered at Mushirwada in Colvale by Fr Henry Heras. 
 
 Twelfth AD Sanskrit writer Hemachandra, while referring to the court of Jayakeshi I of the   dynasty, has written about Buddhist monks interacting with the king of Chandrapur (Chandor). Historical documents about Colvale village make reference to the existence of a Gautama temple.
 
 Buddha’s message to mankind was that of humanity. He also strongly denounced the practice of caste system, rituals and sacrifices in the name of religion.
 
 Milind Mate, a government officer from Panaji, says, “Gautama Buddha’s philosophy nurtured in us the scientific temperament and moved the people away from superstitions and complicated rituals. Buddha’s life and work is the inspiration, and through the practice of meditation and yoga preached by him, we derived peace of mind.”
