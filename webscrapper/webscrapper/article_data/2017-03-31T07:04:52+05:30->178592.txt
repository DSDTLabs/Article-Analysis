LUCKNOW: Number of failed surgeries at surgical   at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences has increased. About 30% of the surgeries in the department now are in the re-operative category, tripling the number two decades ago. 

 The institute will hold a continuing medical education programme during the   (March 31- April 5) on re-operative GI surgeries. Sharing details, head of surgical gastroentrology, Prof Rajan Saxena said, “Re-operative surgeries comprise one-third of our total work burden of 150 surgeries per year.”
 
 He added, “Incomplete or technically incorrect surgeries, operative accidents at the time of first surgery leading to complication, recurrence of disease and second complications emerging out of emergency procedures cause failure of an operation.” 
 
 Faculty member Prof Anu Behari said the proportion of failed surgery change depending on the organ involved. “Gall bladder removal is the commonest procedure done, especially in the private sector and thus more cases of failure from this category are seen. Being less common, pancreas and intestines appear less,” she explained. 
 
 The issue assumes importance considering that 40% of all surgeries taking place in the world relate to the gastroentrological tract (from food pipe to anal canal). Of all, surgeries related to removal of gall bladder to get rid of stones or cancers, were the commonest. 
 
 Stating that reoperative surgeries had a much higher risk of complication experts advised that both surgeons and patients need to be made aware about it. “Surgeons need to be apprised about what to do and how to handle a patient in case the surgery fails while patients need to be told that they should choose their surgeon carefully,” said Saxena.
