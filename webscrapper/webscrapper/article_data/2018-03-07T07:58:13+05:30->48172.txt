LUCKNOW: The undergraduate students of   are both rankled and pleased as they are writing their examinations under CCTV surveillance. Students say that they feel like giving an online examination where they can't look anywhere else except the computer screen and have to focus only on their answer sheet. 

 The examination hall seems more like a silence zone with students not even turning their heads, not even to borrow a pen. Students said that CCTV surveillance has created a self-discipline mechanism with no one ready to take any risk.
 
 "Last year, teachers on invigilation duty found lot of cheating material while frisking students before examination. But this year, nothing is being found even on double checking," said BA student   who was happy that copying has stopped and only those who study hard will get through the exam.
 
 "Last year, we only had to escape from invigilators' eyes to ask answers using sign language from our friends. This year, the threat of camera recording all our activities is such that we cannot ask or prompt," said BCom third year student  .
 
 The scope of scribbling answers on furniture and walls has also ended as CCTV cameras are switched on all the time, complained another.
 
 "It feels like the ' ' house where all activities are under the scanner. Last year, I found answers in code words written on a table by seniors, but this time there is nothing at all," said BCom student Abhinav Gupta.
 
 Students said that earlier it was easier for BCom and BA students to escape frisking because the number of examinees was substantial but now as CCTV has been installed at the main gate of the examination building, invigilators also cannot be lax and they have to ensure that not a single student enters the hall without being frisked.
