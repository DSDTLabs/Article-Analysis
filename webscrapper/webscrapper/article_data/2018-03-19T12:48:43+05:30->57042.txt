 will enhance its association with South Asian subcontinent, by engaging the post-doctorate students in multidisciplinary research, fellowship and artistic residences, publications and more. The   South Asia Institute (SAI), Harvard University, is officially opening its India headquarter in New Delhi. Throughout 2018, leading scholars from South Asia-related fields are delivering a series of free public lectures in Delhi.

 
 "Harvard would not be what it is if it was not capable of attracting the best brains from all over the world. We intend to create a small embassy at the institute, which will help the students and researchers to study at Harvard," said  , vice provost of International Affairs, Harvard University in a chat with Education Times.
 
 "Since Harvard offers several fully-funded courses, with several undergraduate courses inviting generous funding, it is all about getting the right kind of students from South-Asia," said Elliott. "Since India has a huge potential to explore the research opportunities at Harvard, all that is needed is applying at the right time," said Elliott. A similar initiative was started in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where the institute acted as a window to offer guidance to deserving students applying in Harvard. As the   professor of Chinese and Inner-Asian History in the department of history in faculty of Arts and Sciences, Elliott has been closely interacting with students from various nationalities. However, passport is the last thing that Elliott thinks of while interacting with the researchers. "All that matters in Harvard is the quality of mind, language abilities and ability to frame questions," said Elliott.
