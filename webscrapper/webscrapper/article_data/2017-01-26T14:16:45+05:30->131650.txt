PANAJI: Murder accused Vinayak   was shifted to Sada sub-jail,  , six months ago after he allegedly killed Ashpak Bengre, also a murder accused, while lodged at   in Colvale. Apart from links to the Bengre murder case, Karbotkar was booked in 13 criminal cases at Porvorim, Calangute, Ponda, Agasaim and Mapusa police stations, of which eight cases are pending trial and in three cases police filed ‘A Final’ report. He was acquitted in one case and one case was compounded.

 Bengre was attacked by Karbotkar with a sharp weapon while he was waiting to be escorted to the Mapusa court. The   footage of the crime scene revealed Karbotkar’s involvement in Bengre’s murder. During investigation by the crime branch, Karbotkar confessed to his crime, police said.
 
 A source said there’s a high possibility that rival gang members wanting to settle scores with Karbotkar took advantage of the situation when chaos ensured at the sub-jail on Tuesday night and jail mates clashed among themselves.
 
 Karbotkar’s body was shifted on Wednesday to GMC for an autopsy that is likely to be conducted in the next two days. tnn
