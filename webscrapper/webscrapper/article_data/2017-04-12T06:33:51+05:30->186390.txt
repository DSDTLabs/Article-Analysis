LUCKNOW: Bike-borne miscreants targeting women in residential colonies are on the prowl in the city once again after a brief lull. On Tuesday morning, a   identified as Kalpana Singh was robbed of her   in sector F,  , a hotbed of purse and chain snatching incidents.

 The woman was strolling in the backyard along with a friend when two unidentified miscreants on a motorcycle came uncomfortably close to the duo from behind. Before they could react, the pillion rider darted towards the woman and looted her gold chain. The woman later lodged an FIR at Talkatora police station. She told police that the pillion rider was masked with a handkerchief while the driver was wearing helmet.
 
 Officer-in-charge of Talkatora police station inspector Girija Shankar Tripathi who took charge recently said criminal gangs have remained active in the area for the past one-and-half years. “Rajajipuram is known for purse and chain snatching and I have identified a gang that came out on bail in the second week of March,” said Tripathi.
 
 Two incidents of chain robbery in a week, the first in Aliganj, show that some gang is active in the city. Police have managed to keep incidents of chain snatching in check for the past three months though. Additional superintendent of trans-Gomti, the most crime-infested region, Durgesh Kumar said   footage in the Rajajipuram incident was being examined. “Cases of snatching are being reported frequently and the assailants who struck in Rajajipuram seem familiar to those who were involved in the   case,” added Kumar.
