KOCHI: Former CM   has denied the allegation of having had a sexual relationship with solar scam prime accused  .

 Responding to a query regarding the relationship with Saritha by her counsel B A Aloor, Chandy said some business interests are trying to blackmail him and defame him in the society by raising such allegations.
 
  He chose to answer the allegations while appearing before the Solar Scam Enquiry Commission.
 
 Appearing before the   commission, Chandy denied the allegation that surfaced in April that he had met Saritha at his official residence after the Emerging Kerala meet and then at Kerala House in New Delhi. He had met Saritha twice at his office and the photo that appeared in media of Saritha standing behind him during a function at Kadaplamattom is true, Chandy said.
 
 Though the counsel representing Chandy had opposed Aloor’s query, stating that it should have been raised during in-camera proceedings, the former CM said he doesn’t mind answering it in public. He is willing to answer in public as the public should know the facts. The defamation case filed by him is against those who have raised the allegations, he said.
 
 Totally denying the allegations of sexual liaison with Saritha, Chandy said that no such allegation has been raised against him in the 60 years of his public life. 
 
 He is not somebody who lives in a glass house but a person who works among the public. If he had such a weakness, he cannot hide it for even a minute. His office and his official residence were always open and there was no secrecy there, Chandy stated.
 
 Answering Aloor’s query, the former CM also denied the allegation that the sexual relationship occurred while misusing his official position.
