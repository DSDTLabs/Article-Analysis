NEW DELHI: In a big relief to around 5,000 porters who ferry pilgrims on horses and mules to the   shrine in   & Kashmir and are under the threat of losing their jobs after a new walking track is made functional, the   asked the state government and the temple board to frame a policy to rehabilitate them.

 
  As the state government and the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board have refused to help the porters, a bench of Justices   and Deepak Gupta “requested” them to take a compassionate view and rehabilitate them. The court said these people had served pilgrims for decades and they could not be left in the lurch with no means of livelihood. 
 
 “They have served pilgrims for more than 50 years. You cannot ask them to get out after your purpose is served. Please change your approach. It is not a question of law and you must look at it from a humanitarian point of view,” the bench told the board which contended that it was not its obligation to rehabilitate the porters and it was the duty of the state to come to their rescue. 
 
 Additional solicitor general Maninder Singh, appearing for the state, said a rehabilitation policy had been framed and it had to be approved by the cabinet. He said the board too should bear the cost of rehabilitation. 
 
 The court suggested that the board raise money from pilgrims which could be used for rehabilitation of porters. The court said even a small contribution of Re 1 by each pilgrim would be sufficient to raise enough money to rehabilitate the porters. The board assured the court that it would re-examine its stand and agreed to sort out the issue after consultations with the state government.
