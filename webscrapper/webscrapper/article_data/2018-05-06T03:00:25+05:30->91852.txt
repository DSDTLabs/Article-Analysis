NOIDA: Members of   (HJM) burnt the effigy of the   (AMU) management and raised slogans against them outside the collectorate building in Surajpur on Saturday morning.

 They met Rajpal Singh, city magistrate of Greater Noida and submitted a memorandum to him which was addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind in which six demands were raised.
 
 The demands included that the portraits of the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, be “prohibited from display in the country” and that a case be lodged for sedition against those supporting Jinnah.
 
 When Uttar Pradesh state president of HJM, Satyendra Raghav was asked why the matter was not raised earlier as the portrait was hung at the AMU for a long time, he claimed that “appeasement and vote bank politics” were the main reason why such portraits were hung for so long.
