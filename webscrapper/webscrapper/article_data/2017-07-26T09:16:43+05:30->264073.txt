BHOPAL:   home minister Bhupendra Singh Thakur announced to constitute a five-member committee, headed by additional chief secretary (ACS) home, to monitor and inspect cracker and fire work factories and to impose stricter rules and submit its report. Replying to a calling attention motion over poor compensation to the victims of Balaghat factory blast moved by   leaders on Tuesday, the home minister said a magisterial probe into the incident is on and those guilty will be punished. 

 The minister also rejected the charges of poor compensation to the victims. He said every kin of the victims was given Rs 8 lakh.
 
 “I must clear the doubt that despite allegations of poor compensation, the government has given Rs 8.20 lakh compensation to the kin of the victims,” he told the house.
 
 He said the committee - comprising two district collectors, two SPs and one additional director general ( ) of police - will suggest stringent measures to check such incidents in future, he said.
 
 Raising the issue, Congress MLA from Lahar (Bhind), Govind Singh, said the blast in cracker factory, situated in village   district, claimed 26 lives and more than 12 labourers received severe injuries. The government paid a meagre Rs 2 lakh compensation to the victims against Rs 1 crore given to the farmers in Mandsaur.
 
 “The government is meeting a step-motherly treatment to the victims’. The incident exposed the administration’s negligence. However, no action was taken against any official,” alleged Singh.
 
 Rejecting Congress allegations, the home minister said the factory was set up as per norms, with three rooms. However, details of labourers working in the factory were not mentioned in the permission letter. The license of the factory was renewed on April 1, 2016, which is valid up to March 31, 2021, he said.
