ROHTAK: A day after a police registered a sedition case against   (AIJASS) member Sombir Jassia over an alleged   against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, many speakers from the stage blamed journalists for “blowing up” the issue.

 They even threatened those sitting in the press gallery and asked them to leave the venue of the protest at Jassia village. The speakers also dared the police to try and arrest Jassia.
 
 Later, AIJASS general secretary Ashok Balhara tendered an apology for the “bad words against media” by Jat protesters at the venue. Sombir had allegedly said that “he would chop off the PM’s head in 24 hours if AIJAAS chief Yashpal Malik asked him to” in a speech on February 19.
 
 Sombir had made the statement after Malik had asked him to be ready for taking his tractor to Delhi on March 2. AIJASS district secretary Krishan Lal Hooda said their talks with the government committee in Panipat were not fruitful and they were putting their best efforts in mobilising support for the March 2 Delhi rally.
 
 He said they were getting overwhelming support from all communities in registering their tractor for participating in the protest march to Delhi.
