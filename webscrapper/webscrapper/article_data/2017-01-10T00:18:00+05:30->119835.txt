PUNE: A day after hitting the season’s lowest of 7.8°C, the minimum temperature in the city increased by around 2°C to 9.7°C on Sunday. 

 “Amid fluctuation, the minimum temperature may rise up to 12°C in the next five days,” the Indian   (IMD) stated in its latest forecast. 
 
 As per IMD officials, Satara (7.5°C) was the coolest city in the state on Sunday, followed by   (9°C), Nashik (9.1°C)and Pune (9.7°C). “An induced cyclonic circulation has formed near Madhya Pradesh. It has led to some cloudy conditions in some areas of the state, including Pune. The temperature has gone up due to these conditions,” a senior IMD official said.
 
 The official said this circulation has reduced the impact of northerly winds, which bring cold conditions. “Since the cyclonic circulation has halted the flow of northerly winds towards the state, it has resulted into increase in humidity and temperature,” he added. 
 
 The officials further said the impact of cyclonic circulation is likely to reduce over the next couple of days. “It will again lead to fall in the minimum temperature,” they added.
