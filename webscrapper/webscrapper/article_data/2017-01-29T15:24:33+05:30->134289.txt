Mohanlal's latest film   had opened to rave reviews in Mollywood and has been continuing its successful run. Recently, there were rumours that   actor   had expressed his interest to buy the movie's remake rights.

 When we contacted the film's scriptwriter M Sindhuraj, he says, "We have not sold the rights yet. It's too premature to announce about the remake rights right now. It's just been 10 days since the film's release and all of us are happy that the movie is doing well."
 
 Meanwhile, Venkatesh had previously done Mohanlal's role in Drishyam's Telugu remake. In Munthirivallikal Thalirkumbol,   plays a panchayat secretary who rekindles the excitement in his 20-year-old marital life after a college reunion.
