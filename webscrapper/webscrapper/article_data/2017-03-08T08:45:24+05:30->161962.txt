NOIDA: Two men who are accused in the same rape case in which Uttar Pradesh minister Gayatri Pajapati is a suspect were arrested in Noida by the   (STF) of the state police on Monday night.

  (26), a Kanpur resident, and   (52), who is from Amethi, were picked up near Jewar toll plaza on the Yamuna expressway while they were travelling from Delhi to Lucknow in a white Renault Duster, the STF said.
 
 Shukla and Tiwari are among seven, including the minister, who have been accused of rape and criminal intimidation by a woman. While Tiwari was posted as ‘lekhpal’ in Amethi, which is the minister’s assembly constituency, Shukla worked as Prajapati’s assistant in Lucknow in 2014. Tiwari is considered to be the minister’s closest aide, according to police. The two have were to Lucknow on Tuesday for interrogation. 
 
 Prajapati has been on the run ever since an FIR was lodged against him in the case last month. He had approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking a stay on his arrest. The apex court, however, ordered registration of an FIR against him. It also directed Uttar Pradesh Police to file a status report on the probe within eight weeks.
 
 Amit Pathak, senior superintendent of UP-STF, said police swung into action soon after they received a tip-off that the two accused were travelling in an SUV in Noida. “Since the court has not given any relief to the accused, they were planning to flee. The STF team conducted a raid near the toll plaza and arrested them,” he said.
 
 The woman, who is from Chitrakoot, had made the allegation against Prajapati and six others — Vikas Verma, Tiwari, Amrendra Singh alias Pintu Singh, Chanderpal, Rupeshwar alias Rupesh and Shukla — in 2014. A non-bailable warrant has now been issued against all accused in the case.
