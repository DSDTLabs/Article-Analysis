LUCKNOW: A day after BJP's Dalit MP Ashok Dohre wrote a letter to PM   seeking his attention on atrocities on Dalits after the April 2 agitation,   chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Friday that his government was acting as per evidence and was following the rule of law. 

 Dohre had claimed that Dalits, especially in UP, were being targeted by police and cases were lodged against them after the April 2 agitation against the   order on the SC/ST Act. In his letter, Dohre had alleged that Dalits were dragged out of their homes and beaten up after the agitation.
 
 Yogi denied Dohre's allegations, and said, "No innocent person was being targeted by police." He dismissed charges that his government was discriminating against Dalits and public representatives from the community. " Koi bhed bhaav nahi ho raha hai (No discrimination is being done)," the CM said. 
 
 Chhote Lal Kharwar, BJP's tribal MP from  , has also recently written a letter to the PM alleging discrimination by Yogi, state party chief   and organisational secretary  . BJP's Dalit MP from Bahraich, Savitri Bai Phule, too organised an agitation in Lucknow last week claiming that reservation rights of Dalits were under threat.
