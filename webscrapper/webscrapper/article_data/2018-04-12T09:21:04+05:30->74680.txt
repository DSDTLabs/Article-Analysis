CHENNAI: T T V Dhinakaran is trying to misappropriate goodwill and reputation of   not only by adopting similar colour combination of AIADMK's flag but also by using the term ' ' in his outfit's name, chief minister  , who is also the joint co-ordinator of AIADMK, has told the Madras high court. 

 He made the submissions on a civil suit moved by the party to restrain Dhinakaran from using a "deceptively similar" flag of AIADMK for the latter's newly launched  .
 
 "Use of the term Amma or the use of bust of   on his flag is nothing but dishonest representation of the legacy of AIADMK's eternal general secretary. The term Amma to refer Jayalalithaa has been in vogue for decades. AIADMK has used this term of endearment and respect in its promotional material, and for many schemes introduced while it has been in power," Palaniswami said. Therefore, the use of the term and image of Jayalalithaa is evocative of not only AIADMK's ideology but also the welfare schemes of the party, he added. 
 
 Noting that only AIADMK has the right to claim the legacy of Jayalalithaa, the joint coordinator said the election commission by its order dated November 23, 2017, had clearly stated that Dhinakaran faction is not the real AIADMK, and hence his use of the term 'Amma' and Jayalalithaa's bust in his flag is illegal. 
 
 Justice N   posted the suit to June 3 for further hearing.
