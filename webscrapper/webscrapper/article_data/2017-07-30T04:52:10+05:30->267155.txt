NEW DELHI: The Centre is considering to pull out of the   at   ( ), and instead ask states to procure the key farm produce, government sources said.

 As per the proposal, the Centre would bear about 30% of the amount spent for procurement on account of loss that agencies of state governments would incur during storage and release of pulses.
 
 TOI has learnt that this is being worked out after Centre failed to procure enough pulses at MSP post the bumper harvest, which has resulted in distress sale by farmers.
 
 Secondly, the Centre is also struggling to dispose off the old stock of about 1.8 million tonnes of pulses since states are not picking them up from the central pool.
 
 According to sources, the central outgo for compensating the states for their loss is estimated about Rs 1,800-Rs 2,000 crore. The proposal, which was presented to a committee of secretaries headed by   secretary, was recently discussed with state food secretaries. 
 
 The issue even came up for brief discussion at the inter-ministerial meeting chaired by finance minister   on Thursday evening. 
 
 The proposal is yet to be finalised. At present, central agencies, including National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation and the  , are procuring pulses across the country at MSP. 
 
 But considering the huge output of about 22.4 million tonne this year, the central agencies canâ€™t reach out to each and every market.
 
 Sources said states are not taking keen interest in procuring of pulses, and they usually pass the responsibility of ensuring MSP for farm produce to the Centre. Though the government fixes MSP for 23 farm produce, farmers get the floor price mostly for paddy and wheat. 
 
 In the past couple of years, agencies have become proactive to buy pulses at MSP.   secretary Avinash Srivastava did not respond to any of the messages sent to him.
