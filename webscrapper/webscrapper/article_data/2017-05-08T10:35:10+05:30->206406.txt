COIMBATORE: Two college students were arrested by   on Saturday for attempting to steal a post-surgery drug, Fortwin, from the  . 

 Police officials said the arrest would help them nab a gang that has been hunting for the drug across private and government hospitals in rural parts of Mettupalayam and Coimbatore. With   in hand, the officials said they will soon catch the drug abusers.
 
 "The two boys who were handed over are not the kingpins of the gang. But we will catch the operators very soon as we have enough evidence," said Annur police station inspector, Saravanan. He said a larger gang was at work and some girls are also hooked to the drug.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 When contacted, Annur government hospital anaesthesiologist A Kannan said that 10 days ago, two boys entered the hospital and stole nearly 100 ampules of the drug from the post-operative ward. Since CCTV footage revealed the crime, they locked up the drugs and kept a strict vigil. 
 
 On Saturday, two boys entered the hospital campus and were lurking near the post-operative wards. When the nurses questioned them, they said one of their relatives was in the ward. 
 
  
  
 
 
 When the nurse asked the name of the patient, the boys tried to escape. The nurses raised an alarm. "We quickly locked the doors and caught both of them. They were handed over to the police," said A Kannan. 
 
 This is not the first hospital the duo targeted to steal the drug. They were caught on video in a private hospital at Karamadai a few weeks ago.
