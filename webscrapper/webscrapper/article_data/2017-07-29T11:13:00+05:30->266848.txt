CHANDIGARH: The recent showers on Thursday in the city proved that the current   of the city is not able to drain the rainy water rapidly as water remained stagnant in both commercial and residential areas of the city.

 Most of the areas, comprising residential and commercial areas, roads, parks and other public places of southern sectors remained most affected during the heavy outpour on Thursday due to low line area. Though, problem also surfaced in many areas of northern and eastern part of the city, the southern sectors remained worst affected. Most of the roads and the roadside areas were badly damaged.
 
 “The northern part of the city has been designed with the capacity to bear 15 mm of rainfall and southern sector with a capacity of 20 mm, but we witnessed 120 mm rain. Thursday’s rain was exceptional, as no water drainage system can immediately work during such kind of rainfall and we also saw that as the rain got over, entire water drained out properly. There is however a need to look into the areas where problem is serious,” said a senior municipal corporation (MC) official.
 
 As per information, the public health wing of the Chandigarh administration had prepared a plan for the detailed survey of the entire drainage system of the city around five years back. However, no concrete work wa done in the direction. “Since now the matter falls under the jurisdiction of MC, Chandigarh, they will look into the matter,” said an official of the UT.
 
 When asked, city mayor Asha Jaswal said, “It   on Thursday. No system can work in such type of rain. I have come later water drained out properly. But, I will still take up the matter with the officials concerned.”
