MUMBAI: Even though Mumbai's rank dropped to 29 in the   from 10th place last year,   have penalised almost five lakh persons in the past 10 months. The total collection in fact was Rs 7.90 crore, with each month's collection crossing Rs 50 lakh on an average.

 A report on the scheme, available with TOI, shows the highest amount of Rs 1.10 crore was collected in August 2016, when 51,564 persons were penalized for offences like spitting, littering on streets or even littering by pets. While 8,466 persons were fined Rs 100 for certain categories of offences, 39,163 persons were fined Rs 200 each that month. However, as many as1.62 lakh persons were allowed to go after being warned for offences.
 
 Civic officials said if all offenders had been penalised the fine collected could have been double the actual amount, but it was not the intention behind the scheme. “There are times when marshals warn a person and leave himher and fines are imposed only when it's found appropriate,“ said a senior official from the  's solid waste management department.
 
 The BMC's clean-up marshal scheme was resumed in July 2016. There are 30 clean-up marshals in each of the city's 24 wards. Half of the fine collected is deposited in the civic treasu ry, the rest goes to the contractor.
 
 However, the clean-up marshal scheme faced many controversies. On September 8, 2016, TOI reported that   police had written to the BMC claiming clean-up marshals were inappropriately penalizing tourists. First started in 2007, the scheme was discontinued in 2011 after complaints. However, civic officials said warnings were issued to contractors and the scheme has taken off smoothly .“Depending on demand, we will increase the number of cleanup marshals, especially in high footfall areas,“ said an official.
