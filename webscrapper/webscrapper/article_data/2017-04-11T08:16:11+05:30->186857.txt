GUWAHATI:   Irom Sharmila is all set to launch the   of her party People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA). 

 The party had suffered a huge debacle in the Manipur assembly polls last month. In this state, the party will focus on reaching out to the youth to create a platform for addressing the problems faced in the northeast.
 
 "The problems in the northeast are similar. So, it's important to be united for our cause. We have seen interest among the people, especially the youth, here. We will have our wing here very soon," PRJA secretary James Mayengbam told TOI here on Monday.
 
 Dismissing concerns about any lingering effects of the poll debacle, James said, "It was a positive start. Even 10 people are enough to bring about a change. That means what we have at least 90 honest people in Thoubal. Altogether, we have 700 honest people on our side. We will start our journey with these honest people." Three PRJA candidates had contested the polls and all had been defeated by huge margins. 
 
 The issues the party is looking to focus on are illegal immigration, having no authority on the natural resources of the local stake holders and the prevalence of indigenousness, among others. These were discussed with the volunteers in the state.
 
 "The spirit of the northeast is prominent in the conscience of our supporters in Assam. Gradually, we want to move forward in this regard. After that we will move to other states of the region like Meghalaya and  ," James said.
