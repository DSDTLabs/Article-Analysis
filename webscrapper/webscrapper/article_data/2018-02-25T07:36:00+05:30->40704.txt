MANALI: A jawan of the   (BRO), a wing of the Army, had miraculous escape on Saturday afternoon after he was hit by an   at the north portal of Rohtang tunnel in Lahaul. He was dug out of snow after 1.5 hours.

 Identified as Satnam Singh, a Sikh jawan from Punjab, was entering the tunnel with two other local persons from Lahaul to reach Manali when an avalanche hit the area. Singh, who works with engineering wing of 70 Road   at Stingri in Lahaul, got trapped in avalanche, while the two had a narrow escape. A guard stationed at the portal of the tunnel reported the incident to   officials who are engaged in digging of the tunnel. Company’s search and rescue team was rushed to the spot from other side of the tunnel.
 
 Chuni Lal Thakur, head of the rescue team, said: “The jawan remained under about 5ft of snow for nearly 1.5 hours. First we had to locate him with help of avalanche probes (rods used to locate survivors under snow) in a vast area. After ascertaining his position under snow, we had to remove quintals of snow to reach him. He was unconscious. He had will power to survive and was lucky too.”
 
 The main threat while conducting rescue operation was risk of another avalanche. The area is prone to frequent avalanches. The mountain is steep and rises to an elevation of over 13,000ft where snow depth is several feet. The peak was already covered with snow and due to fresh layer of snow it became unstable.
 
 “Many times it takes hours to locate the victims of avalanche but it was result of team work that we reached the victim within hour,” Thakur said. He added that the victim was rushed to the company’s hospital at Dhundi where he is being treated.
