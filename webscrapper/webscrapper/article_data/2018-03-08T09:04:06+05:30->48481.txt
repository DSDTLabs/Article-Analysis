CHENNAI: In a tragic incident, two   drowned in the sea off   Beach on Wednesday evening while trying to a save a   friend from committing suicide.

 The bodies of D Augustine, 19, and R Suresh, 17, who were trying to pull Abraham out of the water, were washed ashore later in the evening. 
 
 The police said the three friends along with three girls, all from a Pudupet neighbourhood, arrived at the beach around 11am and were seen playing on the sand till 3pm. Later, Augustine, a diploma student in mechanical engineering, Suresh and Abraham went into the water, As they were frolicking among the waves, Abraham, who had downed a few pegs earlier, told them he wanted to end his miserable life and kept moving deeper into the waters.
 
 His friends apparently did not take his statement seriously and kept pulling him to the shore. When he continued to move ahead, they realised he was serious and went to his   when they were accidentally pulled in. Abraham, meanwhile, reached the shore and found Augustine and Suresh missing. He and informed a few fishermen who launched a search before alerting the police.
 
 The police say they have been doing everything they can to prevent such deaths. At least two dozen fishermen have been trained and deployed on beaches for emergencies. But the lifeguards say the current along the Marina is strong enough to defeat the strongest of swimmers.
 
 A police officer said few beachgoers heeded their advice. “We erect boards asking them not to venture into the sea but they ignore warnings,” he added.
 
 Even the presence of mounted police personnel does not seem to be a deterrent for many. In February, the Madras high court had directed the Tamil Nadu government to submit a status report on the measures being taken to prevent drowning in water bodies in the state. The bench said that the state government could also consider putting up watch towers along with lifeguards along the coast.
