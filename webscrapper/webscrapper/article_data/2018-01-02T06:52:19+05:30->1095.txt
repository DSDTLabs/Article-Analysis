 - Songwriter   said she has struggled to meet her expectations of being a parent.

 
  
 Reportedly, Faith, who has a 1-year-old child with her partner  , said it is tough for her to be a mother.
 
 "As a new mum, I've struggled with my expectations of myself as a parent. I had wanted a natural birth, but developed complications, so I didn't have a great birth experience and got lots of infections afterwards.
 
 "I'd wanted to be a driven, energetic mother, but the first three months were spent in bed, shivering with high temperatures and on eight rounds of antibiotics while breastfeeding," she added.
