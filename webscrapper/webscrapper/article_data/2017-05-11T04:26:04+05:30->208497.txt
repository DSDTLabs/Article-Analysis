NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind President Maulana Syed Arshad   has urged the BJP-led NDA government to consider declaring   as the “national animal” as he expressed concern over the “atmosphere of fear” in the wake of attacks by vigilante groups.

 Madani also reminded PM   about his assurance to take action against criminals who acted in the garb of ‘gau rakshaks’. Madani, as the head of the influential minority organization that represents a large number of Islamic scholars, demanded that the Centre explore making a common law on cow protection to end the ambiguity and prevent attacks on innocent people from the minority community.
 
 “The government should give national animal status to the cow and we will support it,” Madani told a press conference. “These gau rakshaks are exploiting religion to loot and murder people... We respect the religious sentiments of our Hindu brethren but no one can be allowed to take law and order into their own hands,” he said.
 
 Madani also spoke on the much debated issue of triple talaq. “This is religious matter and can only have a religious solution. If the   comes out with such an acceptable solution, we will welcome it,” Madani said.
 
 A Constitution of the apex court is set to start hearing the issue from Thursday. He said the issue of triple talaq was being blown out of proportion and an impression is being created as though the practice is rampant.
