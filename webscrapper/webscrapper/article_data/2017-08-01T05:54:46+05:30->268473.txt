BHOPAL: After the onion procurement ‘scam’, there seems to be another sack of worms in the making in   — this time, over procurement of pulses.

 The amount of toor and moong dal procured by the government in Tendukheda tehsil of Narasinghpur this year is thrice the average yield seen in the last five years. There was no triple bumper crop? So, where did all this dal come from?
 
 The state government doesn’t procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the embers of the violent farmer agitation in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. When TOI contacted superintendent of land records, Narsinghpur, H L Tiwari, he said that the net sown area of toor dal in Tendukheda was “around 8,000 hectares this year”. At 15,000MT, the average yield per hectare comes to 1.78MT which is thrice the average yield in the last five years.
 
 Information provided to TOI under   by the Madhya Pradesh land records department says that the average production of toor dal in the state was 0.32 metric tonne per-hectare in 2010-11. It rose to 0.63 metric tonne/hectare in 2011-12, 0.69 metric tonne/hectare in 2012-13, 0.72 metric tonne/hectare in 2013-14 and fell to 0.65 metric tonne/hectare in 2014-15. If you take the highest production on 8,000 hectares, it would only be around 5,000MT. That’s 10,000MT short of what was procured. The same quantity of moong dal was procured from the same tehsil this year, though the yield per hectare is lower than toor and it was sown in less area in the tehsil. 
 
 Pulses are being procured at Rs 5,000 per quintal from farmers, while the market rate is around Rs 3,500/quintal. The government spent Rs 18 crore in procuring more than 30,000MT of toor and moong from Tendukheda alone.
 
 After complaints, the agriculture department set up a probe committee comprising officials from agriculture and the co-operative Markfed. It submitted its probe report to the government on July 29, said sources. 
 
 Principal secretary agriculture,   who ordered the probe said, “We have received the report and have sent it to the government for further action.” He wouldn’t comment on the contents of the report, but sources say it points out several anomalies in procurement.
