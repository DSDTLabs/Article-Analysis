LUCKNOW: An incumbent   (SP) MLA renominated for the upcoming polls,  , joined   in New Delhi on Saturday. Mahendra’s wife Pakshalika Singh, who was also re-nominated by SP despite losing the 2012 assembly election from Kheragarh, joined the saffron party too.

 Singh is the MLA for Bah, Agra district. Singh, a former minister in the UP government, is among those who signed affidavits in support of CM   as SP national president. BJP insiders told TOI that he appeared to have lent his support to Akhilesh despite having been in talks with BJP for several months. UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya and the party’s state in-charge Om Mathur were present at the ceremony to induct the couple.
 
 ‘Raja’ of Bah Singh has been a traditional party hopper. From 1989 to 1993, he was a legislator on a   ticket.
 
 He switched loyalties to BJP in 1996, only to part ways and join SP after five years. A day before Singh joined BJP, former Union minister Ashok Pradhan also left SP to return to BJP.
