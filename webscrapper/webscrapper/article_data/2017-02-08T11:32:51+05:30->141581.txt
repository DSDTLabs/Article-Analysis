GUWAHATI: Chief minister   termed the first   of the BJP-led government in the state a 'pro-people' one that would benefit all sections of society. 

 He added that the budget placed special emphasis on women, children and differently abled people. 
 
 Sonowal thanked   minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for preparing a budget 'in synergy with the sustainable development goals of the government' and giving a boost to the spirit of 'Team Assam'. "The budget, with special emphasis on 18 key initiatives, willpropel growth and development," the chief minister said.
 
 Meanwhile, both experts and the public welcomed the budget. Samir Baruah, a known name in the field of financial and banking management, termed it a 'progressive' one. 
 
 "The abolition of plan and non-plan categories is a welcome move. The banking industry has to rise to the occasion. Exemption of entry tax on POS and ATMs and efforts to promote DigiDhan melas are positive steps," said Baruah who has served as the general manager of the Indian Overseas Bank.
 
 Sunit Jain, an entrepreneur, said there should have been more for youngsters, especially as far as startups were concerned. "To create sectoral industrial parks is good but to be honest, I was expecting more measures for startups and MSMEs. This would have driven growth in the local   and helped job-seekers become job creators. Otherwise, it is a good budget," said Jain. 
 
 However,   criticized Sarma for failing to do anything for the welfare of minorities. 
 
 "Sarma neglected allocating funds for minority development. His budget speech was like a sweet dream with little connection to reality," tweeted party chief and billionaire Badruddin Ajmal.
