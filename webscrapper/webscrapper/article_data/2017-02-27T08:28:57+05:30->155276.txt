Mumbai: The   and   may boast that they have secured more than half the total votes polled in the BMC polls, but their candidates have been resoundingly trounced in many electoral wards to the extent that they have lost their deposits. 

 Aspirants lose their deposit if they are unable to get 1/8th of the votes polled. While as many as 2,244 candidates fought the civic polls, 1,162 lost their deposits to the tune of Rs 43.63 lakh. Each candidate has to deposit Rs 5,000 (Rs 2,500 for reserved category candidates) to contest the civic polls.
 
 Candidates losing their deposits implies that they don’t have adequate public support, or worse, they are “non-serious”, say political observers. Many candidates from the BJP, Shiv Sena,  , MNS and   lost their deposits, which indicates that their parties have negligible presence in some wards. The five major parties secured 84% of the total 51,03,913 votes polled in the civic election held on February 21. In the wards where candidates from major parties lost their deposits, most of votes polled went to the winning candidate and runner-up. 
 
 More   had their deposits forfeited compared to those from the Shiv Sena, BJP and Congress. For instance in ward 25 (Kandivali east) a total of 15,466 votes were cast, out of which Shiv Sena candidate Madhuri Bhoir won after securing 7,185 and the BJP aspirant secured 6,792 votes, hopefuls from the Congress (778 votes), MNS (275 votes) and NCP (105 votes) lost their deposits. In ward 211 (Madanpura-Byculla), 21,772 votes were cast, of which SP candidate Rais Shaikh won the election with 9,455 votes and the Congress candidate got 7,081.
