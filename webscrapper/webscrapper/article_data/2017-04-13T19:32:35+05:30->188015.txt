SURAT: The   (SMC) is burning midnight oil to remove number of speed-breakers that it had created on   few months ago, ahead of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on April 17. This is being done to give easy passage to the PM’s cavalcade from the airport. This is not the only case where SMC is working backwards. Because of the PM’s visit, number of essential services in other parts of the city is being neglected. This includes cleaning of roads, garbage collection and others. 

 There are at least nine speed-breakers on Athwalines Road from Parle Point to Athwagate. On Wednesday, Umra zone officials started removing all these speed breakers. D M  , zonal chief of Umra zone, said, “As a matter of protocol we can’t have bumps on the road from where Prime Minister is passing. We will rebuild it once he is gone.” 
 
 Surat had set an example in the country by night cleaning of roads. However, these orange apron workers, who sweep the roads at night, are seen moving on Athwalines Road during the day time since five days. 
 
 As a result, vital road repair and road laying work is suffering. Road cleaning work in some secondary roads is visibly suffering and garden department is busy watering only those plants which are on the scheduled route of PM. 
 
 A top SMC official, on condition of anonymity, said, “Everybody is very busy making the city look clean and beautiful, but at what cost? Number of employees is not going to increase overnight and when all are busy attending to PM’s visit, what will happen to other work of civic body? It will suffer.” “However, government orders are to be followed and when ruling party is over enthusiastic and goes overboard, it is the officials that suffer the most,” he added.
