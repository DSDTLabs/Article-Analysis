NEW DELHI: A 45-year-old   guard working in a private school was found murdered in the premises on Sunday morning. The victimâ€™s face was bludgeoned with a heavy object and his wrists were cut around his veins.

 Police officers said that around 9am, when the victim, Devi Dayal alias Devi Lal, did not respond to calls from outside, a person came looking for him and found him lying near his cabin. 
 
 DCP (Shahdara) Nupur Prasad said that a case has been registered. A preliminary probe indicates that Dayal was working at the school for the past two years as an accountant with a transporter during the day and as a security   at night.
 
 A crime team that visited the spot found a liquor bottle and two empty glasses along with some leftover food items in a plate. The crime scene indicated that the killer was known to the victim and he had a friendly entry into the school.
 
 Investigating officers suspect that the accused got Dayal intoxicated and later hit him with a stone or another heavy object when he lost consciousness. CCTV cameras installed in the school and nearby streets are being scanned to ascertain the identity of the accused.
