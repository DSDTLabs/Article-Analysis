NEW DELHI: The government on Monday said the   ( ) cleared the Rs 59,000 crore   in August 2016, nearly 16 months after PM   announced the decision to procure 36 fighters during his visit to France in April, 2015.

 Junior defence minister Subhash Bhamre, in written a reply to the Rajya Sabha, also said the cost of each Rafale fighter is approximately Rs 670 crore at the prevailing exchange of November, 2016, “without associated equipment, India-specific weapons enhancements, maintenance support and services”.
 
 “The inter-governmental agreement for procurement of 36 Rafales with the French government was accorded approval by the CCS on August 24, 2016 and signed on December 23, 2016,” he said. The statement comes amid a raging political slugfest, with Congress alleging the “non-transparent” Rafale deal was vastly overpriced, violated defence procurement procedures, included no transfer of technology, and was intended to benefit the Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Defence as the “offsets partner” of the French fighter manufacturer  .
 
 The NDA government, however, has countered, saying it secured a “better deal” in terms of price, capability, equipment, delivery and maintenance than the one “notionally being negotiated” by the UPA regime for 126 Rafale jets under the now-scrapped MMRCA project.
