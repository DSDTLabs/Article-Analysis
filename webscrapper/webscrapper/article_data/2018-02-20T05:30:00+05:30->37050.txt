Mysuru: Chhatrapati   was celebrated in the city with fervour at Kalamandira here on Monday. 

 Inaugurating the celebrations, Sridhar Murthy, former professor at St Philomena’s College, said Hinduism is alive in India because of Maratha rulers. It was Chhatrapati Shivaji who saved many Hindu temples from being destroyed at the hands of Mughals in North India during his regime.
 
 Shivaji’s ideology inspired the whole society and even neighboring rulers, he said, and added that he taught people to live in harmony and gave importance and equal opportunities to women.
 
 MLA Somashekar, who was the chief guest, said Shivaji was one of the greatest warriors.
 
 The state government has released Rs 63 lakh to celebrate the   of Shivaji in the state. It is the second consecutive year that the state government is officially celebrating the birth anniversary of the great warrior. The authorities have also released funds across the state to build separate community halls for the Maratha community, said the legislator.
 
 MCC mayor B Bhagyavathi flagged off a procession from the North Gate of the Palace, which was organized as a part of the birth anniversary of Shivaji. The procession proceeded through major roads of the city and culminated at Kalamandira. More than 500 people took part in the celebrations. Corporator Sunil also paid floral tributes to the picture of Shivaji.
