Margao: Margao Municipal Council’s ( ) single-window scheme for issuing trade licences to illegal business establishments received 45 applications on Monday, the first day of its implementation. Chief officer Agnelo Fernandes told TOI the applications would be processed promptly.

 In a bid to shore up revenue, the MMC has introduced the single-window system for a month only. Through it, the civic body will issue trade licences and house tax registration to traders who have so far remained outside its tax ambit.
 
 The scheme involves minimum documentation and hassles, Fernandes said, and added that the MMC is hopeful of netting a handsome revenue through it.
 
 Sources said it was a one-time opportunity for unlicensed traders to regularise their businesses without having to pay any trade tax arrears. 
 
 While the MMC has just over 650 commercial establishments registered with it, the number of individuals plying their trade without the mandatory trade license could be several times more, sources said. They added that upon the closure of the dedicated counter, the civic body would begin to crack down on traders operating illegally within its jurisdiction. 
 
 As per trade laws in force, all shops and commercial establishments have to display their trade and establishment licence prominently in their premises. In the state’s commercial capital, the rule is more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
