Chennai: The Madras high court has directed the Tamil Nadu government to clear by January 11, the pending deficit of Rs 204 crore towards the statutory dues, payable to over 7,000 retired employees of the state owned transport corporations.

 A division bench of Justices S Manikumar and M Govindaraj also made it clear that the amount should be disbursed to the beneficiaries by January 12, at any cost.
 
 The bench passed the interim order despite the submission of the advocate-general that the state is facing a severe financial crisis. 
 
  As on June 22, the state government owed Rs 614.91 crore to over 7,000 retired employees of its transport undertakings. Also, it owed Rs 5,074.75 crore to its existing employees. 
 
 The issue was brought to the knowledge of the court by an 82-year-old retired employee, through a post card. Treating the postcard sent by Mayandi Servai as a PIL, the court hauled up the government which finally agreed to settle Rs 1,136 crore in dues.
 
 A direction was passed by the court to settle Rs 379 crore by December 15. But when the plea was taken up on Wednesday, the government submitted that Rs 175 crore has been released out of the promised Rs 379 crore.
 
 Noting that the court has already given enough time to settle the dues, the bench directed the government to settle the deficit Rs 204 crore before the   festival.
