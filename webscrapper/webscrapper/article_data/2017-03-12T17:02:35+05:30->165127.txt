 and wife   hosted a house-warming dinner on Saturday night that was attended by cricketers, bureaucrats and other prominent personalities of the city. Although on the surface it seemed like a dinner party, there was a bit of a surprise lurking for Pragyanâ€™s father  , who turned 60 recently. Interestingly, everyone in attendance was part of the surprise and the dad was pleasantly surprised by the cake that awaited him. After that endearing surprise, the guests dug into the lavish dinner spread as they caught up with each other. The conversations and chatter went on way past midnight, till the guests slowly retired for the day.
