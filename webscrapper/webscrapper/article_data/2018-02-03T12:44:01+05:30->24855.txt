PANAJI: Two persons from Tiswadi have erected a   in alleged violation of   (CRZ) Notification 2011 on the river bank at   despite a stop work order issued by   panchayat.

 The fence supported by iron railings has come up in a 5,000sqm property of partly terraced morod agricultural land.
 
 The parties brought laterite stones to the site in mid-December last year and started work on a compound wall after clearing some mangroves on the river bank. This followed permission granted by the Aldona panchayat for temporary fencing and a structure, both in property under survey no. 17/5 at Corjuem.
 
 Dr   had complained to the panchayat that he had proprietary rights in this property and urged it to stop the illegal work. He also complained to Goa Coastal   Authority (GCZMA) on January 11.
 
 The panchayat issued a stop work and held an inspection on January 9, but the parties continued the work on the fence and the structure.
