 A pilot drive being conducted at the Ramanagara RTO from January 2 on the implementation of Vahan-4 — an upgraded web-based software — would soon enable all citizens to get their vehicles registered online, apart from getting random, automatic registration numbers.
 
 The software will not only allow users to apply for registration and pay fees and taxes, but will also keep them updated on the application status through SMS or the web portal. It will also facilitate speedy issuance of clearance certificates (CCs) and no-objection certificates (NOCs). The centralized Vahan-4 database has details of vehicles from all states, which can be accessed by the public.
 
 Transport commissioner B Dayanand said: “We will implement Vahan-4 across all RTOs after studying the merits and demerits of the pilot. The online vehicle registration procedure will make the system more transparent, preventing middlemen from extracting money from citizens.''
