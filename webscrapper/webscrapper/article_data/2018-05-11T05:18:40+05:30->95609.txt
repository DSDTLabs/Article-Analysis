NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed Calcutta high court's eleventh hour direction to the State Election Commission (SEC) to accept nominations for panchayat polls received till April 23 through email and refused to alter the May 14 date for polling. 

 "The West   SEC and its functionaries shall see to it that the election which is scheduled for May 14 is held in absolute fairness, keeping in view the concept of purity of an election in a democracy," a bench of CJI Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said.
 
  However, the SC took cognisance of the common allegation by Left parties,   and Congress that the SEC was unable to rein in rogue elements of the ruling   who used force and violence to ensure no contest in nearly 20,000 panchayat seats and election of ruling party candidates unopposed. 
 
  Though the issue was not raised before the SC by the SEC, which only challenged the HC's May 8 order asking the commission to accept nominations filed through email, the bench said it was worried by the fact that TMC candidates had got elected unopposed in nearly 20,000 panchayats. The SEC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, said this was so only in 17,000 of the 58,000 constituencies. "This can only be challenged in a court after the poll process is over," he said. 
 
  But the bench ordered the SEC not to "notify the results in respect of the constituencies where there has been no contest, without the leave of this court". This interim order will remain in force till July 3, unless the SEC moves an application before that seeking to announce the results by providing cogent reasons. 
 
  Appearing for   and other political parties, senior advocates   and S S Patwalia said the ground situation was alarming where the ruling party had terrorised the SEC to such an extent that the commission was refusing to take cognisance of complaints about use of force by TMC workers to threaten other candidates to withdraw from the fray.
