MOSCOW: Putting behind the disappointment a loss in the last game, Indian Grandmaster   bounced back with a draw against   Evgeny Tomashevsky in the seventh round of the  .

 World No. 16 Indian, playing with white pieces, got off to a good opening and was evenly poised for much of the initial phases. However, he miscalculated his 24th move and that allowed the Russian to take advantage mid-way into the game.
 
 But the Indian hung on and with time running out both the players decided to share the point.
 
 "Kc2 was a bad move allowing Black's manoeuvre Bb7-Bc6. After the time control the position was more in favour of Black, but eventually it finished in a draw," Harikrishna said after the match.
 
 Harikrishna now has three points and is placed 15th on the points table.
 
 He will take on Russia GM Ian Nepomniachtchi in the next round later tonight.
 
 With two more rounds remaining, Harikrishna is still in contention to finish in the top half of the table and amass maximum ratings points from the campaign and stay afloat in his hunt for a spot at the Candidates Tournament.
