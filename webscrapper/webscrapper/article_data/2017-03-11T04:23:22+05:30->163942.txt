NEW DELHI: The family of Renu (name changed), a resident of Buddh Vihar near Rohini, had stopped celebrating all happy occasions for the two years she had gone missing. They celebrated her 18th birthday with much fervour after she was reunited with them by the police.

 Not many families, however, have been able to experience the joyous occasion of getting back their  . Of the 21 children who go missing in Delhi each day, a mere 6-7 are located and reunited with their families within three years.
 
 Last year, Lok Sabha was informed that 7,345 children, 3,900 being girls, went missing from Delhi each year from 2012 onwards.
 
 A study on missing children by Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi’s NGO   (BBA) shows that almost 60% were abducted by organised gangs and pushed into the flesh trade or bonded labour. The children are usually taken to Punjab, western UP and Haryana.
 
 “The first few hours after a child goes missing are the most crucial, especially in a city like Delhi where fleeing to a neighbouring state is easy,” said Rakesh Senger of BBA. “The lack of a strong anti-trafficking law and concrete protective measures are reasons for the high incidence of such abductions,” he added.
 
 Police said that children aged 10-13 years are the most vulnerable. Most of them are either lured by a known person or leave home on their own only to fall victim to traffickers.
 
 Komal Ganotra, director (policy and advocacy) at Child Rights and You (CRY), said that almost all children belonging to poor families residing in slums and unauthorised colonies in outer and northeast Delhi were the most vulnerable due to their proximity to the neighbouring states.
 
 “Girls are more susceptible to abduction. In most families, both the parents go to work leaving the children by themselves at home,” Ganotra said.
