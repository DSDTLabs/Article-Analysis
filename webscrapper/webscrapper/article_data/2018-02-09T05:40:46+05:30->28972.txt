Former President   on Thursday said there should not have been any tampering with the history of queen  , as she represented the honour of the entire women's community.

 Speaking to the media here during her visit to the city,   said historical facts should never be tampered with while making films.
 
 Patil's comments came weeks after Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Bollywood flick 'Padmaavat' was released across the country after a prolonged spell of violent protests by Shri Rajput Karni Sena, among others, who claimed that the movie had distorted historical facts.
 
 Shedding light on the practice of women covering the face with a "ghoonghat" (veil), she said that in earlier days, they would do it to maintain their dignity and grace.
 
 The former President is a senior member of the   party and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot had organised a tea party in her honour where veteran party leaders had been invited.
 
 Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee chief   was, however, not seen in the party which yet again sparked rumours of cracks surfacing in the state unit of the party.
 
 A few days back, speaking to the media, Gehlot had said that if a party anoints someone as PCC chief, he should not start dreaming of becoming the Chief Minister.
