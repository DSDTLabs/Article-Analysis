Bapatla: Bapatla police on Monday arrested three persons for murdering a man fourteen days ago near Janda Chettu street.

 The accused were identified as Sheikh Khadar Baasha, Nimmakayala Durga Prasad and Chukkakula Vamsi from the same town. According to Bapatla police, the incident happened back in February 5, where the victim Prasad Reddy, an unemployed man was sitting inside a bar and drinking. 
 
 After finishing his liquor, Prasad Reddy who was in an inebriated state approached the three youngsters in the opposite table and demanded Rs 10 from them. Annoyed by his authoritative demand, they said no and went on to abuse him. Infuriated Prasad Reddy abused them back using vulgar language. 
 
 Later, they lured him outside the bar promising to give him Rs 10. After taking him out, they kicked him against the wall leaving a ghastly head injury. They then took turns and threw bricks at him leaving him grievously injured. Locals took him to a hospital and two days later Prasad Reddy succumbed to his injuries at   GGH. Cops filed a case and began inquiring the details of the incident at the bar and soon arrested them. 
 
 A case under section 302 of IPC ( ) was registered against them. Cops also produced them at a local court for judicial remand.
