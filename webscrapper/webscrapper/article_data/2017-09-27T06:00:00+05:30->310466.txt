When 
  P3P head to shopping dens, it’s usually for some retail therapy, if not anything else. But for this special  , which was hosted by a local club in the city recently, they set their priorities straight. After all, it was for a good cause — proceeds from the sale will go to government   to build roofs and toilets. Stylishly dressed up in vibrant hues, the women brightened up a cloudy, gloomy day. Wheeling around their shopping carts with child-like glee, they browsed through the trendy collection on display — from clothes and   accessories to home decor items and   gift options.
