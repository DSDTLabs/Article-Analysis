HYDERABAD: Students and teachers in   ( ) affiliated schools can now get an   card in their schools itself. This, as the board has urged all schools to volunteer to set up Aadhaar enrolment centres on campus. 

 There are 122 CBSE schools across   with an enrolment of nearly four lakh students. In a circular issued to all schools, the CBSE has urged school managements to not only enrol students and teachers but also enrol their family members. The board has associated with the   as ‘registrar’ to collect data.
 
 “In the new venture, CBSE seeks full cooperation from affiliated schools in enhancing the coverage of Aadhaar enrolment among the students, who don’t have Aadhaar number and of new admissions at the primary stage itself,” reads the circular. 
 
 Schools setting up Aadhaar enrolment centres shall have to collect data as per UIDAI enrolment process. 
 
 The board has also asked schools to procure equipment for the purpose as per the UIDAI check-list. “Equipment such as computer, printer, biometric devices will have to be procured by the school themselves and should be as per the UIDAI specifications,” states the circular.
 
 While schools will not charge any fees for Aadhaar enrolment, CBSE will pay them Rs 30 for every enrolment. “The payment shall be directly transferred by CBSE to schools through electronic fund transfer,” states the circular. 
 
 Schools volunteering have to sign a memorandum of understanding with CBSE/UIDAI. 
 
 Schools are apprehensive as they claim that crowd management will be hard. “We don’t mind such initiatives. However, crowd management will be a challenge,” said  , principal of Jubilee Hills Public School.
