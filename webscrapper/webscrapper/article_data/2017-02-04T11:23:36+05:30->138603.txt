NEW DELHI: A day after the roof and façade of a building in   collapsed, the   ( ) constituted a five-member team to inspect the site and ascertain the reason behind the cave-in. The incident has raised questions about the structural stability of other buildings in the iconic market. 

 NDMC secretary Chanchal Yadav said that the team will comprise structural engineers from NDMC and experts from IIT-Delhi. 
 
 “A meeting was held and we have formed a five-member team to inspect the site and to understand the reason behind the collapse. The portion of the building was lying vacant and there was no construction going on on its premises,” Yadav said. “We did not find any water tank or generator on the roof of the building during our visit on Thursday. The team of experts will submit a report before February 20.” 
 
 She said that the team would also conduct a survey of all “dangerous buildings” in Connaught Place within the stipulated time. “We have sealed the affected property and a few shops in its vicinity to ensure safety,” she added.
 
 The heritage market, which attracts at least 5 lakh visitors daily, has been left neglected by the council, traders allege.
 
 “There are many buildings that need renovation and the owners have filed applications months ago. But the council is taking its own time. NDMC seems to be least bothered about the safety of people,” said Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders’ Association.
 
 The shopkeepers, who have been affected due to Thursday’s incident, said that they were still clueless as to when they would be allowed to reopen their shops. 
 
 Vimal Vahan Jain, the owner of Jain Book Depot, told TOI that he longer felt safe in that building. “What we saw yesterday can happen again. There is a need to do an immediate safety audit of the buildings,” he said.
