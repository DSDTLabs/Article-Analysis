NAGPUR: Mallika Bhandarkar and titles are synonymous to each other. She has dominated the local, state and national level circuit for over a decade now. This time, though, it wasn't that easy as she was making a comeback after a two-year injury layoff. 

 Twenty five days before she had her first state triumph in Nanded after the break, Mallika showed everyone that she still knows how to win the title. On Sunday, City's table tennis queen once again reminded everyone about her skills and talent and walked away with yet another crown. 
 
 Mallika rallied splendidly to emerge triumphant in the women's section of the second   tournament at the Nagpur University Subhedar Hall on Sunday. The tournament is organized by the   (NDTTA).
 
 In the summit clash, sixth seeded Mallika defeated Thane's   4-2. After losing the first game 9-11, Mallika brought parity by dominating the second 11-6. Shreya regained the lead by winning the third game 11-8.
 
 Down 1-2, it was time for Mallika to make her presence felt. She heled the nerves when it mattered and closed the issue by winning the reminder of games 11-8, 11-6, 11-6 for her second successive state title.
 
 Satisfied with her performance, Mallika's coach and father Shreerang Bhandarkar was elated with the way his daughter made a comeback. 
 
 "The biggest improvement Mallika has brought in her game after injury is the backhand top-spin - which was earlier missing in her armoury. Earlier, she used to block all the spinning balls with her backhand. Now she has started returning attacks with an equivalent top-spin that too with both the back and forehand. In short, Mallika has started playing the European style TT," the senior Bhandarkar told TOI.
 
 "To hit smashes after a shoulder injury becomes very difficult as it puts pressure on any paddler. Training in Germany made her healthier too. Her fitness level has gone up and very soon I see her in the top-three of country," he added. 
 
 Mumbai Sub-Urban District (MSD) paddlers dominated the championship by winning three of the six titles that were on offer on the last day. 
 
 In an all Thane men's summit clash, top seed   defeated Siddhesh Pande 11-9, 11-5, 11-8, 9-11, 11-6. Siddhesh, however, avenged his men's defeat by winning the Youth (U-21) boys crown. In the final, Siddhesh outclassed Sanish 11-6, 7-11, 11-6, 11-1, 11-4. Ashlesha Trehan of MSD prevailed over Shreya Deshpande to win the Youth girls crown 4-2.
 
 The Junior (U-18) paddlers from MSD,   and   posted contrasting victories to take home the girls and boys titles respectively.
