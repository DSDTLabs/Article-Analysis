Mumbai: There is more trouble ahead for the  .

 Besides the battle to get the numbers to win the mayoral elections, the party is having a tough time accomodating heavyweights who have won the civic elections. Party insiders fear ego clashes and infighting as senior corporators have staked claim on the two key positions in the BMC, the mayor’s chair and the post of standing committee chairperson. 
 
 Some party stalwarts in the new BMC House are former mayors Vishakha Raut, Milind Vaidya, Shraddha Jadhav, two-term corporator and vibhag pramukh Mangesh Satamkar, Ashish Chemburkar and three-term corporator Kishori Pednekar and incumbent mayor Snehal Ambekar.
 
 Even before an alliance has been forged by any other party, lobbying has begun for the post of the mayor. Feelers are being sent to Matoshree, the residence of Uddhav Thackeray, by some of these heavyweights.
 
 “There will be so much lobbying and infighting this year. Many seniors like the current standing committee chairperson Yashodhar Phanse and group leader Trushna Vishwasrao have lost,”said a senior leader from Shiv Sena.
 
 There are many committees in the BMC, but the most coveted is the standing committee, which deals with allotment of tenders and controls the treasury. “We may need to get into an alliance with some other party to reach the halfway mark of 114 and entering into an alliance would mean giving away some committees to the future ally, further reducing seats to accommodate the seniors,” said another leader.
 
 The most frenetic lobbying will be for the post of mayor as it is in the open category, which means a male or female corporator can stake claim for the position.
