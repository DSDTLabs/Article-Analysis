If there’s one genre that works well on television, it has to be comedy. Joining the league of channels producing comedy shows,   has announced their first season of   recently, which will be telecast from February 4. The show will feature some of the best comic talents from across the state, who were auditioned in cities like Chennai, Tirunelveli, Madurai, Trichy and Coimbatore. 

 Eventually, 31 contestants have been chosen for the show. Judges — actor   of Maragadha Nayanam fame, actress  , anchor and YouTuber  , comedian   and actor Balasaravanan — have been roped in for the show. The judges will scrutinize their performances week after week and eventually choose the winner.
 
 A source from the channel says, “Unlike other genres like singing or dancing, this one’s pretty tough. Not many channels have ventured into comedy because of the same reason. Now that the channel is exploring various genres, the team has decided to bring out a comedy show. They scouted for people who had spontaneity, who could do their own scripts and bring in new voices for mimicry. Around 2, 500 people (from all the cities) came for the audition. Eventually, 30-odd people were selected.” 
 
 On the long panel of judges, the source adds, “The team wanted youngsters as they would get along well with the contestants. Also, there will be incidents when the participants will tease the judges and vice versa. These judges are friendly and will take them in the right spirit. That’s one of the reason why they didn’t opt for senior artistes.” The show will be telecast every Sunday at 1pm.
