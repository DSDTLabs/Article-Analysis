A Bengaluru play stole the show at the   Theatre in Pondicherry over the weekend. Featuring filmmaker-singer-theatreperson  , 
 was staged as part of the prestigious Remembering Veenapani Festival. Directed by Berlin-based Sophia Stepf, the play is an Indo-German collaboration that delves into the realms of digital dramaturgy, repetition and user choices, making way for a new hybrid form of theatre-meets-performance art.
The story is about a “user-friendly, interactive and attractive” mobile phone app, called Shilpa, which has been touted as the most popular app of 2016. This one-woman dramatic piece also happens to be Pallavi’s first solo theatrical performance. Presented by Sandbox Collective, the play relies on a witty, humorous and satirical theme that investigates what it is like being a woman in the entertainment industry today.
 Speaking about the performance, Pallavi, “We have travelled to different parts of the country and abroad with this play, putting up 57 shows so far. But performing at Adishakti was a special experience, more so because the show was a tribute to acclaimed theatre personality Veenapani Chawla. It’s a dream place for every theatre artiste, and taking the stage there was a memorable experience.” Besides running a packed house, the performance also received a standing ovation.
