AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court on Saturday denied bail to two of the promoters of Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd ( ),   and his father Suresh  , in connection with the alleged Rs 2,654-crore bank fraud.

 
 The court posted hearing on the bail plea of DPIL MD   for May 10.
 
 The trio was arrested last month at an Udaipur hotel and a court sent them to police custody for nine days. After their custodial interrogation ended, Sumit and Suresh Bhatnagar filed bail pleas, which were heard on Thursday.
 
 The Bhatnagars have been maintaining that the CBI did not follow procedure in registering an offence against them. There was no complainant and yet an FIR was registered. Without a complainant, the CBI has accused them of cheating 11 banks of Rs 2,654 crore. It was simply a case of loan default.
 
 The CBI, on the other hand, also invoked the Prevention of Corruption Act in this case, expressing strong suspicions that bank officials were hand-in-glove with the Bhatnagar in wasting public money through such bad loans and would therefore not come forward to report irregularities and illegalities. Though DPILâ€™s exaggeration of its projected income to avail of more loans came into the public domain, yet none of the officials concerned came forwarded to complain against the company.
