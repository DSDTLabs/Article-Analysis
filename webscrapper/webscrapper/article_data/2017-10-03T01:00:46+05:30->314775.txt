 The woman, along with her friends, chased down the snatchers who were trying to flee with her phone on a bike. She caught hold of one of them, whereas his two aides were pinned down by passersby. Police suspect these youths to be members of the same gang that had targeted the BSF commandant.
 
 In her complaint, the woman said she had gone to the market on Saturday when three youths on a bike came from behind and snatched her phone. She alerted her friends and kept screaming for help. The youths tried to make their way through the crowd that had gathered there, but were unable to get away. 
 
 They were thrashed and handed over to police. Police said the youths were identified as Sunil, Saurabh and Vishal, all residents of Karol Bagh. 
 
 Police seized an Apache bike from the youths.   said the trio threatened to open fire when the crowd stopped them. Police, however, didn’t find any weapon in their possession. The bike is also suspected to be a stolen one, as the accused didn’t have any proof of ownership. 
 
 The woman had come to Delhi to appear for an examination. A case of theft using force, criminal intimidation and conspiracy was registered against the three youths.
