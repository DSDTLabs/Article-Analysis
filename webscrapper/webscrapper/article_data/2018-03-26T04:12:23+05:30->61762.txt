 Kejriwal took to Twitter to hit out at LG in the light of   on JNU students and journalists during a protest march. “LG should spend more time improving policing in Delhi, rather than obstructing every project of Delhi government,” Kejriwal tweeted.

 A delegation of AAP functionaries is planning to call upon Union home minister Rajnath Singh and Baijal to complain about “police brutalities”. 
 
 The doorstep delivery of rartion scheme has emerged as fresh flashpoint between LG and AAP government. While Kejriwal has launched the attack on LG via Twitter, AAP MLAs have used the ongoing budget session to attack him over the project that the government has been aggressively pursuing. 
 
 In the recent past, Kejriwal has alleged that some officers are in a “deep nexus” with ration mafia even as an AAP functionary claimed that “LG has chosen not to accept the cabinet decision on doorstep delivery of ration on the basis of motivated objections made by some bureaucrats”. 
 
 LG’s office has, however, observed that it was incorrect to say that the proposal had been rejected because “LG has advised that the proposal for home delivery of ration may be referred to the Centre with full details, including all implementation issues, before a final decision is taken”.
