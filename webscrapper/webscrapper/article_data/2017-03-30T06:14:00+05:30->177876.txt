PUNE:   and market watchers want the Union government to remove stock limits of pulses and grains as limit-free trade will benefit cultivators. 

 They said the 10% import duty imposed on wheat and tur dal, just before the grain arrives in mandis and the tur crop which has been harvested, would protect domestic growers from cheaper produce coming from overseas. 
 
 Pravin Dongre, chairman of India Pulses’ and Grains’ Association, said since tur was trading below minimum support price currently, the 10% import duty is a well-thought out move. 
 
 “Other imported pulses that are trading well above MSP have not been included. However, a quick relief to the farmers would be removal of stock limits. Traders can participate in purchasing without restrictions and our farmers can get a good price for their crop. Removal of a ban on exports of pulses would also help farmers,” he added.
 
 Joint secretary of   said farmers end up with less price for their produce because of the cap on stocks that can be held by traders. 
 
 “More demand can be created if prices are decided by the demand and supply mechanism. Our traders have adequate storage facilities of their own to manage large stocks,” he added.
