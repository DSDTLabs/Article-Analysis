HYDERABAD: After days of battling extreme heat, residents heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday, as sudden showers accompanied by thunderstorm and gusty winds lashed several parts of the city, bringing the temperature down to 21 degree Celsius by evening. In last few days, Hyderabad’s average temperature has been hovering around 40-42 degree Celsius.

 
  
  
 
 According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) data, areas under the GHMC limits recorded a total rainfall of 43.55 mm over a span of a few hours, even as isolated pockets in Secunderabad witnessed hailstorm.
 
 The areas that received maximum rain included Ibhrahimpatnam (71.5 mm), Hayathnagar (58.3 mm), Monda Market (43.5 mm) and Uppal (42.8 mm). Areas such as Madhapur, Balanagar, Jubilee Hills, Narayanaguda, Golconda, Nampally, LB Nagar and Bandlaguda also witnessed strong and gusty winds of up to 20 kmph.
 
 Meteorologists at Indian Meteorological Department, Hyderabad, attributed sudden downpour to upper cyclonic circulation and trough formation over Telangana. “There are two upper cyclonic circulations that are passing through the Telangana, north Odisha and Vidarbha region. There is also a trough extending from Vidarbha to   area across Marathwada and Karnataka. These two phenomenon together resulted in rainfall across Telangana,” said Raja Rao, meteorologist at IMD, Hyderabad.
 
 Experts said thunderstorm activity and gusty winds will continue to lash isolated areas across all districts even on Friday. Light to moderate rains are expected to continue for next 24 hours. “While thunderstorm and rainfall activity will continue even on Friday, the temperature will rise once the upper air cyclonic circulation over Telangana weakens,” said Rao.
