 When asked what she last said to her mother, the songstress says, "That's a tough question. It's one of my greatest regrets. It's something I'll carry to my grave or eventually talk about, but I'm not ready now." 
 
 Kelly credits her son, now two, for helping her believe life is still "worth living".
