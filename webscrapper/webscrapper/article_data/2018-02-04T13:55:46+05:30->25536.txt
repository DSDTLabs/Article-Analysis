CHENNAI: After registering criminal cases against at least 50 quacks and arresting 15 of them across the state, the city police have transferred all quackery cases to Directorate of Vigilance and   (DVAC). A couple of quacks had bribed officials to get authentication certificates from them. 

 Anti-forgery wing,   (CCB) of the city police has arrested at least 15 quacks based on specific complaints by the   Homeopathy Medical Council (TNHMC) registrar G Rajasekaran and the councilâ€™s former president R Gnanasambandam. 
 
 City police found that earlier DVAC had registered a case and arrested quacks on bribery charges. As two enforcement agencies are not supposed to register separate cases based on the same complainant, DVAC officials wrote a letter to the city police commissioner to transfer the CCB case to them for further investigation.tnn
