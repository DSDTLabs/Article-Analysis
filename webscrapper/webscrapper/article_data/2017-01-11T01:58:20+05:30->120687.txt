THANE: Tired of repeated nuisance by   along the newly widened road stretches,   from Subhash road and neighbouring areas staged a peaceful protest to highlight their woes to the Thane civic body. 

 A group of around 60 traders from Subhash Road wore black ribbons around their arms and presented a bouquet of red roses to civic officials for not being able to clear off hawkers from the stretch despite repeated reminders.
 
 The group questioned why the Thane Municipal Corporation ( ) was not prompt in providing security to the existing reclaimed land. 
 
 "We met the civic chief and police commissioner with regards to our long standing complaints of clearing hawkers of Subhash Road and also stop the operating of illegal rickshaw stand. We have written letters to the TMC regarding the same," said a trader.
 
 The TMC had reportedly assured traders during their   on the station road in the month of May that the road would be widened for faster movement of traffic. However, nearly eight months after the drive, the situation hasnâ€™t improved a bit with hawkers blatantly encroaching on the widened stretch. 
 
 Civic officials said they have been taking regular action on hawkers in the area.
