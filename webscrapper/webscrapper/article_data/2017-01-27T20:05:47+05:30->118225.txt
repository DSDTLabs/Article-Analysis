 Sheeran had hinted the fans that some new music will be out soon on Twitter. 
 
 "The club isn't the best place to find a lover..." Sheeran tweeted. 
 
  
  
 "I've been working hard on the new material and I hope you can be as excited about it as I am," Sheeran addressed fans in a release. 
 
 "I really wanted to show two different sides to my music that I'm equally as passionate about and I just knew I wanted to roll with two songs at the same time," Sheeran said. 
 
 He added that he was 'absolutely buzzing to be back'. 
 
 While the song 'Shape' is rich with tropical and tribal sounds, "Castle in the Hill" promises a foot-tapping pop beat.
