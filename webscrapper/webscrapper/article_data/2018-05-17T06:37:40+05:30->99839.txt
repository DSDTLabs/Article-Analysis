PATNA: Four persons were arrested on Tuesday in a 32-year-old woman’s gang rape for two consecutive days after making her husband captive inside a poultry farm at   under the   police station area in   district on Saturday and Sunday.

 Punpun police station SHO Alok Kumar said the arrested youths were identified as   (47), Rajkumar Giri (30),   (30) and Rajeev Kumar (25). He said eight persons were involved in the crime. The couple worked as daily wagers at the farm and the matter surfaced after the survivor and her husband approached the police Monday night.
 
 “Prasad is the poultry owner and a prime accused in the case,” the SHO said. Police sources said Harendra Giri, Lallan Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar and Sunny Kumar were still evading arrest. He said Prasad and other accused tried to pressurise the survivor and her husband not to contact police and settle the matter with them.
 
 “However, the couple approached the police on May 14 night and an FIR was lodged against seven persons, including Prasad,” sources said. Prasad and the survivor’s husband came to know each other in Patna and the latter was offered to work at his firm. “On Prasad’s advice, the husband also brought his wife to the farm almost two months back,” sources said.
 
 On May 12 night, two of the accused dragged the woman out of her room while she was sleeping with her husband and raped her in an open area. “After she returned, three more accused raped her inside the room. The next morning, three more accused raped her again,” sources said.
