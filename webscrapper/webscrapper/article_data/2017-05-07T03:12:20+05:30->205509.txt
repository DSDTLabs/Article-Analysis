New Delhi: The country's apex consumer forum,  , has ruled that trusts, unregistered consumer organisations, residents' welfare associations (RWAs), cooperative societies or associations of flat or plot buyers cannot file a case for one or more consumers or on behalf of a group. 

 The order passed on Friday ends ambiguity on who can approach the consumer forum under the category of "  (VCA)".
 
 "A trust cannot be said to be a VCA within the meaning of section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act," the order by a three-member bench said while hearing more than a dozen cases filed by different organisations, RWAs in Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Kolkata and Chennai. 
 
 There have been several cases in the past when trusts and unregistered entities had filed cases in the National Consumer Diputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) seeking relief for consumers. Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act mentions that besides individual consumers only "recognised consumer organisation" can file a case in the consumer forums. It further explains recognised consumer association as those VCAs that are registered under any law.
 
 Both the NCDRC and the Supreme Court have already ruled that a group of consumers with the same interest can come together without forming any association to file a case in NCDRC and qualify under the threshold of Rs 1 crore or more claim. 
 
 The apex consumer forum can take up cases directly where the claim is Rs 1 crore or more. If the claim is less, then consumers need to file cases in the district forum or state commission. 
 
 Welcoming the order, national convenor of Fight for Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA)   said, "It has cleared the ambiguity and will not only help the ongoing cases by recognised VCAs but will also encourage other suffering home buyers to seek justice through collective effort against the builders by forming such associations."
