Veteran singer-actor Barbra   shared her views on the current fight against sexual harassment and #MeToo movement during the the 35th annual PaleyFest, saying that "we are in a strange time". 

  
  
 The Hollywood legend, who was presented with the Icon Tribute during the kickoff to the PaleyFest, commented on how the fight for gender equality is currently at a fever pitch, reported Billboard. 
 
 "We're in a strange time now in terms of men and women and the pendulum swinging this way and that way but it's going to have to come to the center," Streisand told   in a Q&A. 
 
 The 75-year-old star, however, said she was not the target of sexual harassment maybe because she "wasn't like those pretty girls with those nice little noses". 
 
 Streisand also revealed that she did not perform on TV for many years until resurfacing on a channel in 1994 because of crippling stage fright. It was only after "a lot of work on myself" that she overcame her  , with some help from a "a little pill called Inderal. 10 milligrams."
