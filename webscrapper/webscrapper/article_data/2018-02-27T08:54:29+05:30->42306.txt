BENGALURU: Not wanting to drown in the din surrounding his son’s arrest,   on Monday inspected the ongoing renovation work on   in the central business district (CBD).

 Keeping it a low-profile inspection,   toured the street with a team of BBMP officials and his supporters. Most of the passersby were baffled seeing him — while a majority offered their sympathies and expressed solidarity (as a father), a few looked at him with disdain after learning about his identity.
 
 One of the pedestrians exchanged greetings with Haris and told him: “We know what you are going through. You will come out of this.” An overwhelmed Haris responded with smile and hugged the man. As he continued shaking hands with pedestrians, he also made it a point to direct the officials to complete the work by March 1, when the revamped street is scheduled to be inaugurated by chief minister Siddaramaiah.
 
 Referring to the brawl involving his son, Haris told TOI: “The law will take its own course. I felt really sorry about the incident. I have already expressed my shock and apology in the assembly. My political opponents are blowing this issue out of proportion for election gain.”
 
 Haris maintained that people in his constituency are aware of the development work initiated by him and will support him. “They know me as an individual and for my work. I am confident they trust me,” he said. When asked why he is not coming out in the open to clarify issues, Haris said: “The damage has been done. I don’t want to speak about it any more.”
