 Shahjahanpur: A school manager allegedly poisoned his 14-year-old daughter on Thursday night and later tried to burn her body inside the school premises. The accused was seen by locals trying to burn the body and they informed his wife and also lodged a complaint with the police. The latter arrived at the scene and seized the corpse, sending it for a post-mortem. The man is now on the run.   This incident was reported from Bhilawa village of Powayan. Manoj Yadav allegedly killed her daughter and later tried to cover his tracks by trying to dispose of the body on the school campus. However, some local residents noticed the fire and caught Yadav burning his daughter’s body. They summoned the police and also informed his estranged wife.    After learning about the incident, Rekha Yadav rushed to the spot. She identified the burnt body as that of her daughter. By then, Manoj Yadav had managed to slip away.    Police said the couple had separated some time ago and their daughter lived with her father. The girl was against her father’s extramarital relationship and this could be a reason for the murder.    A manhunt has been launched to nab Yadav. Police have also detained the accused’s father and a school employee for questioning.      Rekha told TOI that Yadav often beat up their daughter as she was against his extramarital relationship. On Thursday evening, he beat her up and later poisoned her, she claimed. Later, he attempted to burn the body but was caught by locals.      Circle officer of Powayan Arun Kumar told TOI, “Yadav may have killed his daughter because she objected to extramarital affair but the exact reason will be known once he is arrested.”      Kumar said the girl’s body had been sent for post-mortem. “The accused’s father is in our custody along with a school employee. Their names have not been included in the FIR but they are important for our investigation. The accused will be caught soon.” The SHO added.
