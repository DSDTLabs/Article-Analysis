MADURAI: The state government on Thursday denied that it was a silent spectator on the alleged pollution caused by the Sterlite copper plant and said that steps were being taken to facilitate its permanent closure. While information and publicity minister   said that government departments were inspecting the Sterlite copper plant, deputy chief minister   said the matter was in the hands of the Central Pollution Control Board. 

 Speaking at an interaction after an event at Kovilpatti, Raju recalled the denial of licence for continuance of operations issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). This, the minister said, had stopped production in the plant in the first phase. He added that there was not much the state government could do directly to close down the plant permanently. “This is because it is a nearly 25-year-old unit which is also into exports,” he said. 
 
 Various aspects of the company including exports were under the control of the Union government. “We are discussing legal aspects and also holding discussions with various departments and collecting reports from them. We will take it to the Centre and are confident that they will take the decision to close the plant permanently,” he added. 
 
 However, MDMK general secretary Vaiko said the state Government was cheating the protesters by claiming that the TNPCB had not renewed the licence issued to the copper plant. He claimed in a statement that the government would initiate steps to resume copper production in the plant when the protests started calming down. He said his road campaign against Sterlite would conclude with a public meeting at Tuticorin in the evening of April 28.
