NEW DELHI: As pressure mounted on   over his video post criticising living conditions for soldiers at the border, the   remained defiant, claiming he had surpassed legendary revolutionary   in exposing corruption in the forces.

 “Jo bomb Bhagat Singh ne nahi phoda… woh maine phod diya. Aur ab main peechchhe nahi hatunga (I have done what Bhagat Singh didn’t. Now I won’t back down),” Yadav said in a 2.15-minute audioclip on Tuesday. “If this benefits thousands of others (jawans), then I won’t back down. It’s not a big deal if somebody gets something from my sacrifice,” Yadav said, referring to the disciplinary action he might have to face after his Facebook post went viral across social media.
 
 In the audioclip, uploaded by a news organisation on its website,   said he has no faith in a   inquiry and said his allegations “should be investigated by   or NIA”. TOI could not independently verify the authenticity of the clip.
 
 “I have learnt that 60 to 70 lakh people have watched my video on Facebook. It has happened for the first time. India is waking up for sure,” Yadav said. BSF officials said they were not aware of the new audio.
