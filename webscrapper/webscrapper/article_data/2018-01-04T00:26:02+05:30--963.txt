Trichy: The delta farmers have alleged that chief minister of the state has diverted water to other channels along with Cauvery. The government has announced various subsidies for the benefits of delta farmers. However, if water is not available, what is the use of providing various subsidies, questioned the general secretary of Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association, Mannargudi S Ranganathan. The first priority should be given to Cauvery delta farmers as per the Government Order (GO), delta farmers have appealed.  “There is a GO from the period of Independence states that priority should be given to delta farmers in releasing water to Cauvery. The chief ministers’ action of diverting part of the water from Mettur to other areas particularly Salem, Erode and other places will definitely reflect in delta region,” Ranganathan alleged. The rainfall during northeast monsoon caters to the need of paddy raised in delta districts. However, the deficit rainfall in Trichy and excess rainfall in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts hasn’t helped the farmers. The only source of irrigation is Mettur reservoir, farmers said. Hardly one lakh acre paddy crop was being cultivated in and around Salem districts, he said. If one lakh acre crop failed, the insurance compensation would be only to the extent of one lakh acres. Suppose the entire delta failed, 15 lakh acres will be lost and the insurance compensation will also be a huge amount, he added.
