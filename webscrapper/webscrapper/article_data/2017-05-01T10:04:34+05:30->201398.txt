PATIALA: A   fed her two children food laced with poison before committing suicide after her drug addict husband refused to mend his violent behaviour in Manakpur village near   on Saturday evening. 

 Karamjit Kaur, her seven year-old daughter Gurleen Kaur and one-and-a-half-year old son Gurkirat Singh were declared brought dead at   and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, after being referred from AP Jain Hospital, Rajpura.
 
 Karamjit, the daughter of SAD worker   from Harpalpur village, had got married to Ravinder Singh of Manakpur in 2010. She discovered that Ravinder, working as a security guard with a private firm, was a drug addict. When she confronted him, Ravinder allegedly started mistreating her. 
 
 Unable to bear the abuse, Karamjit last year took up the matter with the village panchayat. The panchayat gave Ravinder another chance after he gave in writing to correct his behaviour. However, the beating started again. Karamjit’s father Sukhdev Singh said his daughter called him up last week to tell him that staying with Ravinder had become difficult as he would come home drunk and beat her. 
 
 Sukhdev Singh said he had assured her that after harvesting the crop, he would visit their house along with other relatives and set things in order. 
 
 “However, Karamjit took the extreme step,” Sukhdev Singh said. He said Ravinder had also started accusing her daughter of having a loose character. 
 
 Ravinder’s parents and younger sister were settled in the US and he had been taking care of ancestral property.
