KOLKATA: Flat No. 44 D of   wore an eerie look on Wednesday. A day after it was engulfed by a blaze, charred objects were strewn all over, half-burnt wires jutted out of the walls and a pungent smell lingered in the air. The lone occupant of the flat,  , was charred to death on Tuesday evening.

 Prima facie, it seems the fire was caused by the explosion of an LPG cylinder as it originated from the dining area of the 1BHK flat.
 
 
 Police recovered the sexagenarian’s body on the floor near the bedroom. Reportedly, Bhattacharjee rushed down to alert the security guards about the fire, but went back to his flat to get some documents. This time, he could not make it to safety.
 
 Even as residents of the apartment on   tried to come to terms with the tragic incident, life was far from normal on Wednesday. “I still shiver at the thought about the fire that took a life. The screams of our neighbours and the fire tender’s siren still echo in my ears. Luckily, the fire did not spread to other flats,” said  , a school student who rushed out of the building with his mother.
 
 The 14-storey tower houses 56 flats. Bhattacharjee lived alone on the fourth floor. Residents said he mostly kept to himself.
 
 Power connection to all the five towers of the apartment were switched off for about two hours. Even as the lifts in other towers were functional by Tuesday night itself, the one in the tower where the fire broke out became operational from Wednesday morning.
 
 “We have been told there will be a meeting on fire safety on Thursday. Being residents of highrises, we need to learn how to escape safely in such situations. Tuesday’s incident is an eye opener for all of us,” said a resident of Saptaparni Apartment.
