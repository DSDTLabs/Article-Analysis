Chandigarh: Leading a delegation on study tour to South Africa, Haryana state minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs Karan Dev Kamboj on Friday held a meeting with Black Business Council on silos, agriculture, cold chain, cooperation in agri-farming, storage and skill development. 

 A spokesperson said that South Africa has evinced keen interest in increasing cooperation in the fields of silo management, agriculture and skill development, storage and improvement of land. Apart from Kamboj, Friday’s meeting was attended by additional chief secretary of food, civil supplies and consumer affairs SS Prasad, Thanesar MLA Subhash Sudha and Nilokheri MLA Bhagwan Das Kabirpanthi. The delegation also met South Africa’s finance minister Malusi Gigaba.
 
 The Central government has already given approval to construct godowns in Haryana with capacity of 9.50 lakh metric tonnes. While traditional godowns have been constructed in Haryana for a long time and large amounts of grains are kept in the open, the construction of silos would ensure safe storage of all grains. The spokesperson said that Kamboj had already led delegations to Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to study techniques for safe storage of grains.
