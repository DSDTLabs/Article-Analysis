HYDERABAD: Demanding immediate filling of vacant teacher posts in all government educational institutions and asking the state government to bear the revised degree fee of economically backward students, various student unions on Friday organised a state-wide bandh.

 The organizations criticised the government for its 'anti-student' policies and demanded that the problems being faced by students be addressed immediately. Apart from organising schools' bandh, the unions in Hyderabad took out a rally from   to   in which about hundred students participated. Most of them were detained by the police and let off later with a warning.
 
 “It's been three years since   was formed, but the problems facing the education sector have not been addressed. Even today, teacher posts are vacant in almost all educational institutions and government is least bothered to fill them,“ said KS Pradeep, general secretary, Progressive Democratic Students' Organisation (PDSU). The student leaders also lamented government's failure to form a school fee regulation committee.
 
 “We have more number of corporate and private schools in Telangana than in any other state and these schools are charging exorbitant fees. The government should immediately form a committee and ensure fee is regulated,“ said  , one of the participants in the rally.
 
 The organisations also asked the government to provide free KG to PG education to all students.
 
 “While there are nearly 60 lakh students in the state the government is providing free education to only 2 lakh. They can't just open a few residential schools and wash off their hands,“ said  , general secretary, SFI.
