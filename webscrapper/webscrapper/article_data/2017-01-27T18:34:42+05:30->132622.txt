NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   on Friday said at a rally in Jalandhar that Punjab wants to see its Chief Minister   re-elected in the upcoming Assembly elections. 

 He said although the   veteran had been in public life for many years, he never changed parties or compromised on ideals. 
 
 As the Punjab CM himself watched on, PM Modi said the upcoming polls were about giving renewed strength to "the land of the brave and the courageous." 
 
 He weighed in on remarks made earlier by Congress-Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who raked up the issue of the drug menace in Punjab at a rally in Majitha. 
 
 The PM said "some people," who were saying "improper things" about the youth of Punjab needed to be taught a lesson so they don't "point another finger at the state."
 
 The PM accused the Congress of political opportunism, saying it had stepped in when it saw an opportunity in the SP (Samajwadi Party)'s internal feud - despite criticizing the party for weeks. 
 
 "Will the people of Punjab step into a ship which is on the verge of sinking?" he asked.
 
 Modi also referred to the politically sensitive issue of the Sutlej Yamuna Canal, and said Punjab has the right to use water for irrigation.
 
 He said waters from the Indus river which flow into Pakistan as waste, will be brought to Punjab. Haryana and Punjab have been locked in a bitter legal and emotional battle over the issue for the several years.
 
 The Punjab polls, which will be held on February 4, will see three major contenders face off: the ruling BJP-SAD alliance, the Congress, and the Aam Aadmi Party.
