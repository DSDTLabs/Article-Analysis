NEW DELHI:   slammed the government over the electoral bonds issue, saying on Monday that it would perpetuate “electoral malpractice” and increase opacity in  .

  spokesman   said the scheme was an exercise to ensure that the ruling party garners all the funds and no individual or corporate entity is able to donate money to the opposition out of fear of being targeted.
 
 He said the government in power will ascertain as to who has donated to the opposition parties or purchased the bonds and those donating to opposition parties will be targeted, as has been happening.
