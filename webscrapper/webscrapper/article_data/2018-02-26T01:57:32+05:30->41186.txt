Kharagpur: The   development ministry will seek an explanation from the Be-ngal chief secretary on why West Midnapore district magistrate (DM) Jagdish Pras-ad Meena did not attend a review meeting that had been convened by the Union minister of state in Kharagpur town on Sunday.

 Taking exception to Meena’s absence despite a letter from the chief secretary’s office on February 22 informing the state about the visit, minister Ram Kripal Yadav said a junior official had been sent to the meeting convened to review centrally financed rural development projects. District officials said the ADM in-charge of development had reported for the meeting. “Officials of the department concerned and the ADM attended the meeting,” Meena said.
 
 “I have not seen any DM behave like this before,” fumed Yadav, adding that it was a matter of concern that central funds were unutilized. 
 
 “In Grameen Sadak Yojna, the flagship project for rural road development, only 35% of work has been completed in Bengal. In Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, a flagship scheme for housing, only 3.75 lakh of the 14 lakh people identified have been provided homes. We are giving money but the state is unable to spend. The unutilized funds will be taken back,” added Yadav.
 
 The Centre provides 60% of the funds in these schemes and the state is required to pitch in with the rest. 
 
 The West Bengal chief minister has often spoken against the Centre walking away with the credit for programmes in which states have substantial financial commitments.
