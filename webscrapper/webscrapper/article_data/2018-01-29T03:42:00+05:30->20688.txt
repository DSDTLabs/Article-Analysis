Panaji: The Curca-Bambolim-Telaulim gram sabha on Sunday opposed the inclusion of certain areas in the proposed Bambolim Planning Area, alleging that private forest and cultivable land was sought to be targeted for development.

 The gram sabha, chaired by sarpanch Maria Dâ€™Cunha, discussed the proposal of planning area and members demanded that no approval be issued for any development till the regional plan was prepared and infrastructure was adequate for such development.
 
 Villagers are suffering due to lack of adequate water, power supply, road network and a system for garbage management.
 
 The sarpanch said that the panchayat had already registered its opposition to the inclusion of areas into Bambolim Planning Area through a letter to the town and country planning department.
 
 Further, she said that the forest department had been informed about the felling of many trees in forest land in   with a request for action against the offenders.
