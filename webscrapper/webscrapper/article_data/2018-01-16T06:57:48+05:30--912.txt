LUCKNOW: She had come to Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) from Bangladesh with discomfort owing to a swollen lump down her throat. On Monday,   was smiling and even speaking with ease. The 61-year-old had a thyroid tumour with early signs of cancerous tissue, for which SGPGIMS not just brought to her dedicated expertise but also made it possible for her to get operated at lowest expense. 

 Residents of   in Bangladesh, Lutfunnessa and her son Lutfar Parvez had first approached Singapore for the woman's treatment. However, they were quoted exorbitant rates. An Indian doctor at the Singapore-based medical facility then told them about the expertise of endocrine surgeon Prof  , chief medical superintendent (CMS) of SGPGIMS. Parvez got in touch with   through email and reached SGPGIMS on January 9.
 
 "We were asked to get tests done and the surgery was performed on January 11. My mother is fine now and we will be going back home on Tuesday. We were particularly worried about her thyroid tumour because my sister is also undergoing treatment for thyroid cancer in Singapore," said Parvez. "But the package there for my mother's treatment would have cost around Rs 3-4 lakh which is eight to ten times more than what I paid here," he added.
 
 Prof Agarwal said, "The expertise is not available anywhere else and the cost they incurred was the lowest possible. We had to remove the thyroid to ensure no cancerous tissue is left. She will get her voice back in two weeks." Recurrence of tumour happens within six weeks if even a part of the gland is left with affected tissue, which will not be the case for Lutfunnessa, he said.
