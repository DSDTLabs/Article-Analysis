VELLORE: Condemning the   government for indulging in large-scale irregularities in the   societies’  , state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) K Balakrishnan asked the state government and the Tamil Nadu Co-operative   Election Commission to cancel the ongoing anti-democratic election process and conduct a free and fair election.

 Balakrishnan in a press statement stated that since the announcement of elections to 18,775 societies in the state in four phases, the ruling party along with officials have indulged in malpractice.
 
 Except for 300 societies, nomination papers were received only from the AIADMK cadres in 4,400 societies in the first phase of the election, he alleged, adding that the nomination papers from non-AIADMK cadres were rejected without any reason.
 
 Officials joining hands with the ruling party held the elections in a “dishonest” way, he said and added that it indicates that the second and third phase of the election would also be held in a similar manner. It would make a mockery of democracy, he said. He also cautioned government officials that they would be answerable when cases filed in the court against the irregularities.
