Chandigarh: At an adoption camp held at the   on Saturday, rabbits drew attention of youngsters and all five were adopted within two hours.

 Visitors from Patiala, Zirakpur and Chandigarh who adopted the rabbits said they were lucky to have got them, while a large number of children returned disappointed. Jaskirat, a Class V student who visited the adoption stall, was seen asking the organisers if they could request someone to surrender their rabbit, but failed to get one.
 
 Puppies also got a better response this time. Volunteers outside the stall were convincing the visitors to adopt them, as they were a man’s best friends.
 
 Jairoop, a volunteer from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), said this year rabbits got a huge response and puppies were also a bigger draw as compared to the previous year in Chandigarh. She said out of 33 puppies, 22 were adopted. “Two adult dogs, a Pitbull and a Pointer, were not adopted,” she added.
 
 Sahil, a BSc second-year student who adopted a dog, said he had informed his family to get ready to welcome a new member.
