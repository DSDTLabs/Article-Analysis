VADODARA: Keeping future requirements in mind, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has started the process to acquire land for setting up a parallel   and extension of the basic strip near the runway. 

 According to AAI officials, once the acquisition is done, it will save time of aircrafts while landing and taking off at the new integrated terminal building of   
 
 AAI requires 21 acres land for setting up the taxi track and extension of the basic strip for which a proposal has been submitted to the Vadodara district collector. Presently, since there is a single runway at the airport, another aircraft cannot land or get ready for take-off, till the time the aircraft that occupies the runway clears the runway. 
 
 After parallel taxi track is set up, while one flight is on the runway another flight can get ready on the parallel taxi track for the take-off. 
 
 Similarly, an aircraft that lands at the runway can immediately clear the runway by reaching the parallel taxi track so that another flight can land on the runway. 
 
 This will eventually, save the time taken by the aircrafts to reach runway from apron. 
 
 As of now, only eleven scheduled flights including five to Delhi and six to Mumbai operate from the Vadodara airport.
 
 “But, we have moved the proposal keeping the future requirement in mind as it will save time of aircrafts especially when there is not much difference between arrival and departure times of aircrafts,” said  , general manager (projects). 
 
 For the basic strip, AAI requires approximately 150 metres land on both the sides from the runway centre line for safety purposes. 
 
 “Whenever flight takes off or lands, the adjacent area should be cleared of all the obstacles so that in cases of emergencies, it does not result in much damage to the flights,” said an AAI official.
