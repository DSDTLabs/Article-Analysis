SURAT: For the residents of   , the festival of kites -Uttrayan -is incomplete without the signature dish called `undhiyu' made from papdi or green bean. Surat's Katargam was famous for its green bean, but the rapid expansion of the area, which is also known as the diamond hub, endangered the very existence of the traditional crop.Still, Surtis are getting the regular supply of the papdi during the festival season.Thanks to the farmers in the coastal belt of   taluka for giving a new lease of life to the endangered traditional crop of Surti papdi.
In the last few years, over a dozen coastal villages have started cultivating Surti papdi in abundance. An estimated 500 acres of land in these villages are under the cultivation of green bean, popularly known as Kartargam ni papdi.The reason that Surti papdi is world-famous is because of its distinct quality and taste. It is a fresh green, tender pod with only three soft, tiny beans within. Its texture is velvety , cooks quickly and it has a strong fragrance. Primarily a winter vegetable, its heat warms up the cloth that farmers tie it up in to take it to the market.
 
 If farmers are to be believed, its seeds were first brought to   village in Olpad from Katargam some one-and-a-half-decade ago. It was around this time when the cultivation of papdi in Katargam was hit following encroachment of alluvial farmlands by land sharks gobbling up Surat's built heritage and eradicating its traditional crops. For few years, farmers in Sandhiyer cultivated Surti papdi, but soon shifted to aquaculture farming.
 
 It was from here that the farmers in Kapasi, a coastal village tucked on the periphery of Olpad taluka thought of cultivating the Surti papdi.
 
 Today , Kapasi village, which is bestowed with a range of small hillocks, is a major producer of Surti papdi. Over 300 acres of land in Kapasi is under papdi cultivation.
