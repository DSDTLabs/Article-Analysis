Ahmedabad: Amid the ongoing Dalit agitations, ‘Tame Keva?’a Gujarati movie, releasing later this week, strikes at the most common but oblique and dreaded question that is first put to a stranger in Gujarat to find out his or her caste.

 The film aggressively and in a bitter manner conveys the message that society should stop practising untouchability. It also seeks answers to the question of caste reservation, as against the demand for quotas for the poor.
 
 ‘Tame Keva’ is only the second film in the history of Gujarati cinema to address issue of caste and untouchability, 38 years after the critically acclaimed ‘Bhav ni Bhavai’ by renowned film maker Ketan Mehta had brought us a satire weaving the Megh Maya legend of the Solanki era. Bhav ni Bhavai told the tale of a youth from the suppressed classes being sacrificed by King Siddhrajsinh Solanki to end water woes.
 
 Tame Keva’s director, Dr K R Devmani, told TOI, “Bhav ni Bhavai dealt with problems faced by Dalits in the past. My film talks about the problems being faced by Dalits at present. Many people claim that untouchability and casteism are no more practised, but the same situation still prevails but is seldom highlighted.” The protagonist of the film raises why people first ask others ‘Tame Keva?’ He says how he is always terrified of being asked this question. This reflects the perception that caste and surname of a person are more important than his abilities. He also reminds members of the scheduled castes that their present progress is not due to their goddesses, but thanks to Ambedkar.
 
 In protest against untouchability, the protagonist is shown standing on the street holding a placard that reads, “I am Dalit. Please hug me.”
