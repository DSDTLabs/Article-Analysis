BHOPAL: While city's 'little librarian'   is running 'Bal Pustakalay' under a make-shift canopy at   locality, the   ( ) is making efforts to ensure facilities for the children's library. 

 Harish Gupta, deputy commissioner of BMC, said, "When we went to the place with the engineers and planners, the locals resisted construction of a library. They have encroached upon that piece of land and are not ready to move." While the children are having a hard time studying under a canopy, BMC has identified another piece of land 10-20 metres from the existing library. 
 
 "We are now planning to provide a room with proper infrastructure for shelves, fans and mats for children at the entrance to the locality. But since the kids loved the place near Ahirwar's house, they do not wish to shift to the new place. We are trying to convince them," added Gupta. 
 
 Gupta said the kids of the locality want the library right outside 11-year-old  's house. But as the land is mired in dispute, it is not possible to construct the library there. 
 
 "The budget for the library has also been finalised; we are now trying to make the children understand how beneficial it will be for them, if a proper room is constructed for them. Even if it a little further from Muskan's house. When a proper room with proper infrastructure is construed, Muskan will be able to use the fund of Rs 2 lakh that CM   gave to her to purchase more books."
