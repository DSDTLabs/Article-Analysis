BHOPAL: Waking up to possibility of frauds in admissions under the Right to Education Act (RTE), the state government has made it mandatory to furnish Aadhaar cards, biometrics of children for online admission under the 25% quota from new academic session. With this, Madhya Pradesh has become the first state to have made biometrics and Aadhaar information mandatory to provide students admission in private schools under the quota.

 “As admission process under the RTE is about to start in the state, it is now mandatory to provide Aadhaar number, finger prints of children for authentication of information for admission under RTE. This is one of the major steps to plug loopholes in admission process,” said Rajya Shiksha Kendra director Lokesh Jatav.
 
 He said the state moved a step ahead in using Aadhaar for admission and fee reimbursement under the RTE as Aadhaar authentication has now been made compulsory. The director said particulars of parents would be verified, too, and applications would be accepted only after finding details genuine.
 
 “Biometrics will be put to use to authenticate and verify the Aadhaar numbers of children by Aaadhaar authorities on the spot during application submission. Only if the Aadhaar number and certificates are found genuine, the application would be accepted. Otherwise, the applications would be rejected on the spot," Jatav stressed.
 
 After drawing fire over irregularities in disbursement of fee meant for admissions under RTE, the school education department this year made its reimbursement through online. The fee will be credited directly to bank account of schools.
 
 The reimbursement will be done online using a software developed by the   (RBI) to avoid involvement of district project coordinators in the process. The school education applications for admissions under the   for the 2018-2019 academic year will be open from March this year.
