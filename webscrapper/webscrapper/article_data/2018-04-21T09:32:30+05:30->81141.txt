NEW DELHI:   could lose around Rs 8cr this season because of the pending case in the   regarding the weak structure of the old club house at the Ferozeshah Kotla. The Daredevils will be hosting their first game against Kings XI Punjab on Monday without spectators and media being allowed inside the sought-after enclosure.

 
 On Friday, the Delhi High Court cautioned the   (SDMC) against “making a mistake” in its “enthusiasm” to give structural stability approval to the Ferozeshah Kotla's old club house for setting up equipment to broadcast   games.
 
 In case of a shutdown, the IPL franchisee stands to lose more than Rs 1 crore from each game. Daredevils make around Rs 5cr from each game through gate receipts at Kotla and collect a total revenue between Rs 32 to Rs 35 crore per season. They will stand to lose Rs 8cr if the entire old club house remains shut for the rest of the season.
 
 Sources said that only camera personnel will be allowed on the second floor of the old club, which was the media den, while the commentary box will be shifted to the first floor just above the side screen.
 
 The ground floor will accommodate the production unit of the broadcaster and the DDCA staff offices will remain shut during the games. The old club house block used to accommodate close to 2300 spectators.
 
 As per IPL rules, Daredevils had the option of shifting base to some other city like Kanpur, Lucknow, Raipur, Indore and even Rajkot. The Daredevils team management, though, prefer the Capital.
