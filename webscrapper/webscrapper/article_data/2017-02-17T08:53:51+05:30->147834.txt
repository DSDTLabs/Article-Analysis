VADODARA: The assault on a   (VMC) executive engineer by a BJP corporator dominated the protests by workers’ unions active in the civic body on Thursday. 

 The unions had planned the protest to press for their pending demands and the assault only heightened tempers.
 
 The Khanderao Market headquarters of the civic body has been simmering ever since corporator   tried to slap executive engineer   after an argument. Vasava allegedly ducked and avoided being hit by Dadhich on Wednesday. A large number of workers and employees had stayed away from work on Thursday in wake of the incident. Six unions had planned the rally on Thursday. 
 
 The rally began from the collector’s office at Kothi and culminated at the Khanderao Market. Participants in the rally banged plates and raised slogans in favour of their demand. 
 
 Placards were also made to highlight the incident involving Dadhich and promised support to Vasava.
 
 Vadodara Mahanagar Seva Sadan Engineers Association president   said that the rally received good response. 
 
 He added that the demand of having a policy to handle issues of violence against staffers was also raised by the unions.The protests went on for over an hour at the VMC headquarters as municipal commissioner Dr Vinod Rao was in the annual budget meeting. He received a memorandum from a delegation of the unions and it was after this that the crowd dispersed.
 
 The union leaders then went to the Warasiya police station late in the evening to press for registration of an offence against Dadhich. 
 
 The police had accepted an application by Vasava, but had not registered an offence regarding the incident till late in the evening. Officials said that they would investigate the matter and register an offence, if needed.
