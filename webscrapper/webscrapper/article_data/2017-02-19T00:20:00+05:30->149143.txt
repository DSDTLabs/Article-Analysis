NAVI MUMBAI: The general body has asked   to reinstate   Diwakar Samel, which may cause conflict between them, said sources. The administration presented a proposal to confirm the suspension during general body meeting on Friday, which was opposed by the house. 

 The house revoked the suspension stating that   was in need of employees and suspending officials by paying half salary was adding to the financial loss. Samel was   in December for failing to address encroachments in his ward.
 
 “The Municipal Corporation Act states that general body has the authority to suspend officer from the rank of assistant municipal commissioner. So when the proposal for confirming the suspension was put forward, it was opposed,” said mayor Sudhakar Sonawane.
 
 Members also questioned the manner in which civic officials were being suspended. Corporator Sanju Vade said that Samel, who had just taken charge as the ward officer, was suspended without any inquiry. Commissioner Tukaram Mundhe stated that he has the authority to suspend as per MMC Act.
