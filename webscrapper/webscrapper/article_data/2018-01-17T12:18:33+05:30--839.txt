CUTTACK: The British-era cemetery   will finally get a   to ensure that   can conduct the   of their departed in a smooth manner. 

 A rest shed was an old demand of the residents, as well as the members of the Christian community. In the absence of one, people were facing problems cremating their dear ones, especially during monsoon.
 
 Cuttack MP Bhartruhari Mahtab has allocated Rs 10 lakh for the project from his MP LAD fund. "Work on the project will start soon as the design for the rest shed has been finalized," said local corporator Ramjan Khan.
 
 The building will be a combination of Italian and European architecture. "The Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) will carry out the work and we plan to finish it within two or three months," Khan added.
 
 The graveyard, established in 1822 to bury British officials and their family members, has been in a dilapidated state for the past many years. Minor repairs were carried out recently and pathways were built inside the graveyard.
 
 "The administration has turned a blind eye to Gora Kabar. Five years ago, it said the graveyard would be renovated and converted into a tourist stop. But nothing was done," said a resident, C K Mohanty.
 
 Moss has covered the graves and the writing on the epitaphs has faded. Locals said many foreigners visit the graveyard to pay homage to their ancestors and express concern over its condition. "Gora Kabar has history attached to it and there is a need to preserve it. If the CMC and the district administration fail to take steps, the cemetery will crumble," said B B Das, another resident.
