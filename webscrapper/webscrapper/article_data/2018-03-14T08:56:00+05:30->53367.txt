MOHALI: The personal   of Derabassi   N K Sharma has been accused of allegedly threatening shopkeepers in Zirakpur.

 Around three dozen shopkeepers have lodged a written complaint with the municipal council and police, alleging   has been threatening to get their shops demolished if they do not obey his commands.

 A delegation of shopkeepers led by Jang Bahadur, Rajinder Sharma, Devinder Singh, Sumanpreet Singh and   on behalf of 20-odd shopkeepers alleged Sunder Kumar runs a hairdresser shop in their market. They said, “After cleaning his shop, he throws the hair cut outside their shops. If someone objects, he threatens to get our shops demolished by boasting that he personally knows the MLA. He has been doing this for past many years. He also picks up a fight with shopkeepers every other day and parks his vehicle outside our shops.”
 
 On the other hand, the MLA denied knowing any such hairdresser. Sharma said, “I am not aware of any such man and nor any of the shopkeepers have ever approached me with complaints against him. If someone on his own misuses my name, people must come with the complaint to me first.”
 
 Shopkeepers alleged Sundar has also been going around saying if someone wants to get work done from the MLA, he could get it done for a fee.
