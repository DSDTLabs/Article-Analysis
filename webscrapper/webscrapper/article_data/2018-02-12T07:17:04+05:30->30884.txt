BAGAHA: The hurdles in   of NH-28B between Bagaha in   and Paniyahawa under Kushinagar district in   via Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR), which connects Bagaha-Chhitauni Gandak rail- cum- road bridge have been cleared.

 Sources said the standing committee of National Board for Wildlife (NBW) in its meeting held on December 8, last year approved the road project, which would go through Madanpur forest range in VTR. A letter in this regard was sent to state environment and forests department on January 4, this year.
 
 The NBW in its approval stated that the project will involve diversion of 13.27 hectares of forest land from VTR for construction of the said raod, which will improve the existing transportation system in the region.
 
 Sources said that additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Bharat Jyoti has forwarded a copy of the letter to executive engineer, Motihari division of   (NHAI) on January 25, to go ahead with the project.
 
 Bagaha-Chhitauni Gandak NH-28B road-cum- road bridge was opened by the then Union railway minister   on June 6, 2002. Though the rail line has been constructed and it is functional, road construction was pending due to objections raised by VTR officials. Agitation for construction of NH-28B through VTR was going on by various local groups including Bagaha-Paniyahawa NH-28B construction action committee led by Gyaneshwar Mahato and Tharu Welfare Federation, West Champaran, among others.
