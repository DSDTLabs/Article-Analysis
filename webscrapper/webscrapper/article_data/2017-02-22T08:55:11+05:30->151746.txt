JALANDHAR: Fathers of several students removed their shirts outside a private school in Jalandhar on Tuesday to protest against the school issuing a notice that their wards would not be allowed to appear in the final exams if they did not deposit annual charges. 

 The parents alleged that the management of the school in Jalandhar's   had refused to hear them out when they went to meet the principal over the notices.
 
 While police intervened and the protest ended, the issue remained unresolved. 
 
 School principal Ravi Suta said the enhancement of fee was within norms and there was no restraining order from the court on charging the fee.
