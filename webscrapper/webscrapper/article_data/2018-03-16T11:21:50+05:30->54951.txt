Corporation Commissioner 
  Sought To Allay Fears Regarding OHTs In A Chat With TOI 

 
 
 A: At present only 115 MLD of water is being drawn from Vaigai. The tanks would be very useful in distributing the water to the households since the quantity of the water supplied by us will be high once the new drinking water project is completed. OHTs are crucial for storing water. All the existing OHTs and the newly proposed OHTs would be put to good use. 
 
 
 
 A: The project will cater to the drinking water needs of the city for years to come. At present the civic body could not meet the growing demand of water. At a time when the city is developing fast and big software companies are coming up, it is important that the civic body provides the required amount of water. Many companies are ready to come to Madurai since very good human resource is available here. It is the duty of the corporation to provide the basic amenity like water. 
 
 
 
 
 A: We are planning to start the project as soon as possible and hopefully it would be completed in two years .
 
 
 
 
 A: The project is being carried out with funds from AMRUT and  . They have stringent social norms and it is mandatory to consult with the public before the projects are rolled out.
