 Telugu boy Koteshwar was right on the money from the start on race day. He took a 30-boat length lead to win the last race of the series that won him the state gold and the Junior Telangana State Trophy.
 His fellow Telugu competitors, Saibaba and Gautham, did try to give him tough competition but eventually, lost out to his splendid matchless form. Saibaba, who started the race at fourth position at the beginning, had two bad races that got him out of the medal race in the Open category. 
 Earlier in the day, the last two races of the Telangana State Open Regatta in the Junior category took place amid mild winds ranging from 8-12 knots. Telangana Junior Sailing Champion for 2017, Koteshwar, could only manage bronze in this category as he trailed Ram Milan Yadav in the opening part of the race and could not recover from it. Milan from Madhya Pradesh won gold in that category. 
 “I am proud to declare that we have finished two state level championships in a row and the attendance from across the nation has tripled this year,” said Lt. Gen KS Rao, president of the State Sailing Association.
 Held at the Hussain Sagar Lake, the sailing championship received 45 entries from six states — Telangana, Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.
