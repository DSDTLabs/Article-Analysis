AHMEDABAD: A white paper on water pricing in Ahmedabad has been prepared by the   ( ). The document was being circulated since last December for opinions of various officials. The issue of water pricing will be tagged with the 24x7   ambitiously planned in the city.

 According to the water policy, in residential societies it will now be compulsory for every house to install a meter to check wastage. Under this policy, a payment limit has been set for fixed usage of up to 20,000 litres a month and a fixed rate that ranges between Rs 240 to Rs 2,880 depending on the carpet area of the property. 
 
 Any extra usage will be charged at rates per 1,000 litres of supply. This rate ranges from Rs 1 for properties with a carpet area of up to 15 square metres to Rs 12 for properties with a carpet area of more than 1,000 square metres.
 
 The AMC had earlier announced the installation of water meters in areas of Jodhpur, Navrangpura, Stadium and   on a pilot basis to study water usage, and then planned to extend metering to the entire city. 
 
 The proposal says that the AMC incurs a cost of Rs 6.05 per 1,000 litres for treating and supplying water to citizens and charges 68 paise per 1,000 litres, according to the present taxation structure. “We are just seeking opinion from various officials on this. The policy will be sent to the state government for opinions as well,” says a senior AMC official.
 
 TIMES VIEW
 
 Once the water pricing policy gets framed the AMC should seek public opinion - as any democratic process would demand. This will involve inviting suggestions on proposed water meter installation charges and water supply rates. The AMC should provide details of the policy on a public forum or a website to invite suggestions and objections so that the policy is framed in a transparent manner.
