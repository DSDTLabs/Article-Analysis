AHMEDABAD: “Taare Zameen Par” is a long forgotten story for most of us. But the pain and struggle it highlighted still continues. Several students fought odds to excel. The results announced on Tuesday brought smiles not just on Laila Kalyanwala’s face but all those who had worked round the year to ensure support and assistance to her. Laila, a student of Delhi Public School, Bopal, had to face many difficulties. She was unable to comprehend subjects like Science and Maths, but she scored cent per cent marks where her forte was.

 Nothing could stop her from cornering 100 marks in Painting. A joyous Laila said, “I did my best in showing two facets of the planet Earth, wherein one side highlighted greenery and the other side showed polluted planet.” The girl who has lost her mother and is raised by her father and grandfather adds: “I faced some problems in IT, but then I managed to pass in that too.” When asked what she aspires to be in life, she responds, “I want to be one of the top fashion designers.”
 
 Her father  , who is the business head with a private concern, said, “I identified her problem in early stages and ensured that she gets the best possible education. I am happy that she is doing well in life.”
 
 Talking to TOI, DPS principal Surender Sachdeva, said, “Seven children with special needs had taken the exam and all have passed with flying colours. Two of them scored cent per cent marks in Painting.”
