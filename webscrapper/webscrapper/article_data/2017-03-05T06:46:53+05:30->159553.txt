VADODARA: Around 35 thalassemia major and blood cancer patients of the city got the opportunity to try their hands at art and craft during a workshop organised by city-based voluntary group – The Wishing Factory. The artworks prepared by the thalassemia major patients at the workshop will be displayed at city-based Sarjan Art Gallery. The workshop was coordinated by gallery owner  . 

 “We will be organising such art and craft workshop in Vadodara, Mumbai and probably Ahmedabad after which the art works will be showcased through an exhibition,” said  , founder of The Wishing Factory. “Workshop is on concept of art based therapy. All the patients were asked to make their own portraits. This activity was meant to eliminate their own fears and make them confident about themselves,” said Thakur. A similar session of the workshop will be held at Kanti Rana’s Hobby Centre on March 11. 
 
 “But it will be held with a different theme,” said Thakur, the young Barodian who has started the organisation to help fulfil wishes of thalassemia patients – be it to undergo treatment, buy a tablet, a smart phone or a simple wish to get dressed as a fairy.
