INDORE:   on Sunday detained all four suspected accused involved in   shootout which took place on Saturday evening. 

 Gawde was shot dead in a busy   area by four bike-borne attackers on Saturday evening. The incident took place at street number 7 when Gawde was standing in the area. 
 
  Sonu, Rituraj Maratha, Golu Yadav and Sonu were detained. “The suspects have been detained for questioning. We are looking at all the angles in the case,” said ASP Prashant Choubey. 
 
 Pardeshipura police told TOI that the deceased was a habitual offender and was involved in Roop Singh Meriya murder which took place in 2005. Meriya was an infamous goon of Kulkarni Ka Bhatta.
 
 Gawde was released from the jail a few days ago after completing a sentence in the murder case and had been working at a toll tax in city.
 
 Police were also looking at his call details because there was a possibility that a close friend or a relative was also involved in the case and had brought Gawde to Pardeshipura area for a meeting where he was attacked.
 
 “We are looking into this angle as well. The last call to him was made by his sister-in-law but since Gawde was in this area for some work for two hours we cannot say that he was lured to the spot before the murder,” said Choubey.
