NOIDA: A burnt body of a man aged under 30 years was found in   village in Phase II on Monday morning.

 A local spotted the body near Samsung manufacturing unit around 9 am on Monday. The man’s clothes were burnt in the fire. Police said the body seems to have suffered around 90% burns and only his belt was left on the body.
 
 “His body seems to have been set on fire using some oil and waste polythene bags. While it is hard to identify the person, he seems to be aged under 30 years,” Phase II SHO Shawez Khan said.
 
 According to police, the man seems to have been murdered on Sunday night and then set on fire so that his identity cannot be established. Blood was found on the spot where the body was recovered from, which has led police to suspect that the man was murdered and his body set afire later on. 
 
 The SHO said the police will preserve the body for three days and will wait for any claimants. “The body will be sent for postmortem in case no one comes to claim it after three days. We are trying to find out his identity but have not received any success so far,” he said.
 
 An FIR has been lodged against unknown persons under IPC section 302 (murder).
