BHOPAL: Railway board has asked all divisions, including Bhopal division, to look for possibilities to deploy retired railway employees if required in departments to step up safety of passengers. While   recalls retired staff to strengthen security of passengers, railway unions has observed on Monday a “Black day” against the notification of the board. Railway employees protested at division railway manager’s (DRM) office at Habibganj.

 According to a recent notification from Bhopal division of   (WCR) and Jabalpur division, services of retired security staff were sought. The staff has been recalled from departments like track maintainers, shunting master, pointsman, technicians with maximum age limit of 62 years.
 
 “However, those who have taken voluntary retirement are not allowed to apply for it and preferably he should have retired from Bhopal division,” said senior   division official.
 
 Railway employees said accidents are being used as a ploy to weaken unions.
 
 A letter released by railway board on January 30 asked all safety category officials holding supervisory positions to quit union office-bearers’ posts and concentrate on safety issue for safety of passengers. They have been given time till March 31 to do so. Phillip Oomen, divisional secretary, West Central Railway Employees’ Union said, “This letter is against the Trade Union Act, which allows non-gazetted employees to take over such posts in union. We will continue to protest until government rolls back this order and appoints officials to safety-related vacant posts. There is no relation between safety supervisor posts and accidents. The step aims at weakening unions across country.”
