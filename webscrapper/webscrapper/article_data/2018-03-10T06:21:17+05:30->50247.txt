CHENNAI: Under-privileged children undergoing treatment at Adyar   have something to cheer about.

 Cuddles Foundation, an NGO that provides holistic nutritional support to underprivileged children affected by cancer, has tied up with AnandRathi Wealth Services that aims to raise funds to provide food and nutrition to over 100 malnourished children undergoing treatment for cancer.
 
 Launching the first ever fund-raising event in Chennai, AnandRathi aims to support Cuddles Foundation in providing food and nutrition to 100 malnourished children diagnosed with cancer. The initiative will enable the foundation to start their services in two more hospitals – Christian Medical College, Vellore and Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre, Madurai.
 
 Cuddles Foundation founder and CEO   said, “The chances of survival for underprivileged kids are 90% to 92% but most of the kids end up having incomplete treatment because of malnutrition. Even the government thinks there is a need for it.”
 
 Dr R  , an oncologist at the Cancer Institute, said, “Cuddles Foundation has been supporting the malnourished children at the institute for a year. They have provided food and nutrition for 300 children.”
 
 “Cuddles have also provided easy tubes which the children are using because it is less painful,” he added.
