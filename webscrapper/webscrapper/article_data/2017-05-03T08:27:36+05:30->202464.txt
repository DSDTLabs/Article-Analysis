MANGALURU: Former chief whip of legislative council K S Mohammed Masood alleged that Muslim youths are being tortured frequently in the name of questioning by police in Dakshina Kannada district. He was speaking at the ‘Mangaluru Chalo’ rally organized by the   in the city on Tuesday.

 He urged the government to put an end to illegal detentions and torture by the police. He said that Ahmad Qureshi, who was picked up by the city police in connection with the assault on Prakash Poojary, has been subjected to torture. “Qureshi is forced to spend his days in hospital due to police torture. What will be the outcome if the allegations of police torture on Qureshi are investigated by a junior officer of CID? Truth will come out only if the case is investigated by an official of IGP rank or through a judicial probe,” Masood said. 
 
  president K Ashraf said that those who tortured Qureshi may continue to do the same on others too. “Efforts are being made to confuse the government by giving wrong information and thereby divide Muslims in the district. We will protest if such torture is meted out to any person belonging to any community. The   would have taken up Qureshi issue and fought for justice if   was in power in the state. However, Congress leaders are now dilly-dallying to hold protests for Qureshi fearing disciplinary action from the party,” Ashraf said and pointed out that many Muslim youths were tortured in connection with the murder of Karthikraj too.
 
 Advocate Dinesh Hegde Ulepady said that rules should be amended to terminate police officials, who violate human rights by torturing people. 
 
 People’s Union for Civil Liberties national vice-president P B D’Sa, Bhatkal Thanzeem representative Inayathulla, religious leaders Shafi Saadi Bengaluru and Abdul Khader Darimi Kukkila spoke.
