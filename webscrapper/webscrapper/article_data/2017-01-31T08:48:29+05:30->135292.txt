NAGPUR: A 36-year-old man tried to kill his wife by asking her to drink some poisonous substance before he himself consumed poison at their place in Kolba Swami Nagar under jurisdiction of Yashodhara Nagar police station on Sunday. 

 Relatives rushed the couple to Mayo Hospital where the husband Mukesh Patil was declared brought dead while the wife Roshni is admitted in ICCU. 
 
 It is learnt, Mukesh used to assault Roshni as he doubted her character. Roshni had lodged several complaints of domestic violence against him.
 
 Police have registered offence of attempt to murder against Mukesh following a statement by Roshni. Cops said Mukesh took the extreme step in front of their two sons Sarthak (8) and Sandesh (5), who informed the relatives.
 
 Mukesh, an alcoholic, married Roshni eight years ago. He worked at a petrol pump but was sacked following his misbehaviour. Roshni’s mother Sulekha Talmale told TOI, “Mukesh didn’t allow Roshni to find work. In 2015, she left his house and lodged the first FIR against him.” 
 
 “Earlier this month, Mukesh went missing after thrashing Roshni. She lodged a missing complaint but he returned within a week. He then convinced cops who requested Roshni to go back with him,” added Sulekha. 
 
 On Sunday afternoon, an inebriated Mukesh thrashed Roshni in front of their sons. “Roshni called the cops who then asked her to leave the place immediately along with the children. But Mukesh grabbed her hand and forced her to drink poison,” said police sub-inspector UA Rathod and added that even as the kids pleaded with him to leave their mother, he too consumed poison.
 
 In a similar incident, one Naresh Hattidhele had tried to kill his wife Chhaya (30) by hanging her to the ceiling with her sari in front of their two daughters on January 20.
