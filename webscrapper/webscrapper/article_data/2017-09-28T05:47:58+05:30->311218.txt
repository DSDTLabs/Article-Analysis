GURUGRAM: Two   were arrested near   late on Tuesday and slapped with charges for obscenity at a public place. The women allegedly also failed to produce their passport and visa, and were taken to a city court, which sent them to judicial custody on Wednesday.

 Police said a team from DLF-1 police station, led by ASI Sunita, found the duo “creating nuisance” near Bristol Chowk around 11.45pm on Tuesday and took them into custody.
 
 Sources said while the two women failed to produce any documents to establish their identities or give details of their local address, the police personnel also failed to understand their language.
 
 “The women were not behaving normally and were indulging in obscene activities at a public place. Passersby were stopping their vehicles and trying to talking to them. Some local people informed us about it. So, we went to the spot and brought them to the police station,” ASI Sunita said.
 
 Later, based on the complaint lodged by Sunita, an FIR was filed against the women under sections 294 (obscene act) of the IPC and Sections 3, 14 of the Foreigners Act at DLF-1 police station. Following the procedure, the police have informed the Kenyan embassy about the arrest.
 
 “The women are from Kenya, but they were not carrying their passport and visa with them. We have also informed the embassy concerned about their arrest,” said inspector  , SHO, DLF-1 police station.
