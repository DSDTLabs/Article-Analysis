Ludhiana: A married couple accused of 20 immigration frauds managed to speed away in their car when stopped at a police check post laid near Samrala Chowk on Sunday. A policeman was injured as he jumped out of the way of the speeding vehicle.

 Bajda village resident Pritpal Singh and his wife, Jaswinder Kaur, have been booked for attempt to murder in a fresh case registered at Division VII police station, as it has been alleged that Pritpal tried to run over the injured cop, Maninder Singh, while fleeing from the post.
 
 The in-charge of Crime Investigating Agency-II, inspector Rajesh Kumar, said the couple had been posing as immigration agents and had duped people in Mohali, Zirakpur and Ludhiana of lakhs by taking money on the promise of sending them abroad. “They have been made accused in more than 20 cases. Both of them have been declared proclaimed offenders in most cases,” he added. 
 
 Kumar said they laid the check post on getting information that the accused were travelling towards Samrala Chowk in their Maruti Creta car. “We managed to stop the vehicle,” he said. “But as soon as a cop tried to remove the keys of the car, Pritpal hit the accelerator and nearly ran over the cops there.”
 
 However, minutes later, the accused rammed his SUV into an auto-rickshaw. Though a police team reached the car, the accused fled from there on foot. It has been alleged that though the CIA team tried to follow the car till Dholewal, the couple ran away.
 
 The injured cop is under treatment at a hospital. “We have started an operation to nab the duo,” added Kumar.
