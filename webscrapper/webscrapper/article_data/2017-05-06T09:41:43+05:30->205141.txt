NEW DELHI: A day after a 39-year-old woman's disrobed body was found in her apartment in west Delhi's Tilak Nagar, her friends said that she had last been seen at home on Wednesday morning. Cops said on Friday that they had leads in the case and were in pursuit of some suspects. 

 The cops said that they had found blood stains on the left side of the staircase up to the fourth floor of the building where the woman, Bhavna Thakur, lived. “We have rounded up a few people and are questioning them,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Vijay  , DCP (West), said Thakur had a live-in relationship with a man who has not been located since the incident. “We are trying to trace him,” said Kumar, hinting that he might be the prime suspect. The man, according to the cops, had a history of 18 criminal cases, and had only been released from jail on April 27 after serving time in an attempt-to-murder case. Suspiciously, the man’s family members are also missing.
 
 Police were informed about Thakur’s death by a friend, who on failing to receive any response to her repeated calls, reached the house to find out what was wrong. She found the woman lying unconscious on her bed, with injury marks all over her body.
 
 Thakur, mother of a 16-year-old son, had moved into the apartment with her partner a month ago. “She used to leave home early and come back late. She hardly interacted with anyone,” said a neighbour. 
 
 She ran a coaching institute in a rented building near the Tilak Nagar market for those aspiring to study abroad. One of her landlords said Thakur had rented the space last year under the man’s name, claiming he was her husband. “We asked her to show us pictures of her marriage but she dodged the issue,” he said. “The man used to drop her off at the institute and pick her up almost every day.”
 
 A student described Thakur as a friendly teacher. “She was approachable and tutored us patiently,” said the student, who was taking English classes.
