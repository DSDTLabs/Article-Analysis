VISAKHAPANAM: Even though there has been a spurt in spinal cord injuries these days, lack of proper spinal rehabilitation centres in the city has been hindering  

 Doctors are highlighting the necessity of a post-discharge rehabilitation therapy so that patients become self-reliant. 
 
 Last year an NGO set up an Ability Rehabilitation Centre (ARC) with the help of the district administration to cater to the needs of those with spinal cord injuries. 
 
 Dilip Patro, director and founder secretary of the NGO, said, “Among 10-20 road accidents in the city, there are at least 2-4 cases of spinal cord injuries every month. While surgical management is carried out by hospitals, rehabilitation services needed for social, vocational and educational improvement are missing. Hence, ARC came forward with all the facilities that can add mobility to the lives of these patients.” 
 
 ARC, the only spinal rehabilitation centre in the city, has 10 beds, a prosthetic and orthotic centre, an assistive technology centre, a skill development centre and occupational therapy. Around 20 out-patients come there saily for counselling and therapy. 
 
 Patro added, “Around 80 people with spinal cord injuries availed rehabilitation services at our centre last year. We attended to 20-30 patients, mostly from the backward sections, this year.” 
 
 City-based neuro-physician Dr   said, “I get at least 10 patients with spinal cord injuries every month. After surgery, patients are sent home and we advise them to take rest. Being untrained, the caretakers have no idea how to deal with these patients. A rehabilitation centre will bridge this gap.” 
 
 A two-day physiotherapy conference for doctors as well as a workshop for caretakers would be held in the city from Saturday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of ' '.
