AHMEDABAD: Continuing to raise his voice condemning recent rape cases in the country, Patidar quota agitation leader  , on Sunday, addressed a public gathering in Danilimda along with   leaders.   said he appreciated the Union government’s decision for capital punishment in child rape cases.

 Hardik said, “Today, people are angry and anguished over the recent rape cases in Surat, Kathua, Unnao and Rajkot. We welcome the Indian government’s decision to bring capital punishment for rape of girl children up to the age of 12 years.”
 
 “This protest was not about a religion or about Hindus and Muslims but this protest has been triggered because all Indians have united to condemn these rape incidents,” Hardik said. 
 
 A mock court was also held on the occasion where four dummy accused were given capital punishment in front of the public with the crowd clamouring, “Hang the perpetrators.”
