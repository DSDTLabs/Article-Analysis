 Under the non-recurring cost, a sum of Rs 94 lakh will be spent on the lab for equipment. Another TRs 50 lakh will be spent on renovating the building. Rs 15 lakh has been sanctioned for staff and another Rs 15 lakh will be spent on consumables, contingencies and training every year.
 
 The facility will help identify viruses and other agents that cause grave damage to public health as well as agents that cause epidemics or agents that are used for bioterrorism.
