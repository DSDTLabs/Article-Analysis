UDAIPUR: Only few of the   living in cities may have seen or heard of bullock carts. ‘Bail-gaadi’ or the bullock cart that had been the   until three decades back, today has become a rare sight even in village areas. So when a caravan of   passed through the National Highway-162 recently, it grabbed wide attention.

 Kailash, son of Mohanlal Choudhary, ex-sarpanch of Udaipur's Mavli village rode on a bullock cart and so did all the baraatis who accompanied him to the bride’s home in Salera Khurd village on Sunday.
 
 The baraat comprised of a caravan of 21 caparisoned bullock carts and the bridegroom was also seated in one of them. The family is said to be quite well off and so it was a surprise for the villagers to see the bullock procession. On being asked for the reason, bridegroom Kailash said that it had been a custom in their family.
 
 His grandfather VeniRam Choudhary who had been the sarpanch for 40 years, too had gone on a bullock cart to bring his bride and so did his father. Hence to continue the family tradition and also to set an example to others to value the age-old traditions, they had opted for this kind of wedding procession, Kailash said.
 
 Women sang folk songs all the way while the melodious tinkling of bells tied around the bulls’ necks complemented the surroundings. “We intentionally avoided the modern means of transport to spread the message of environment conservation. Also, no loud music was played, the only musical instrument used was the ‘dhol’ to mark the wedding celebration,” the bridegroom’s father said.
 
 In a similar marriage function held in Rajsamand city on Sunday, the boy’s side arrived in 12 bullock carts to the bride’s residence from Lavana village, some 7 kilometres from the town. Residents enjoyed the spectacular sight when the procession passed through the main streets. Even more surprising was the face that the bridegroom is a doctor.
