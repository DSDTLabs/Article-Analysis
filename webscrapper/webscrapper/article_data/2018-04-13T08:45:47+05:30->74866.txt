CHENNAI: Perhaps it is a faux pas of the highest order -- the National Anthem was not played or sung on both the functions attended by   governor   on Thursday, along with Prime Minister  .

 They and their entourage attended the inauguration of DefExpo-2018 in the morning, and the opening of   buildings in the afternoon. Both functions did not have the National Anthem either at the beginning or at end of the function.
 
 A Union ministry of home circular dated on January 5, 2015, issued as per the directions of the Calcutta high court, lists nine occasions which should have the anthem. They include the arrival and departure of the President of India or governors of states for functions organised by the government.
 
 The full 52-second version of the anthem should be played or sung at official functions “on arrival of the governor/lieutenant governor at formal State functions within his State/union territory and on his departure from such functions,’ said the circular.
 
 It was sent to all chief secretaries, administrators and all state governments/union territories, besides all departments of central government, as per the orders of the Calcutta high court dated September 22, 2014. The shorter 20-second version should be played at functions where toasts are raised.
 
  This is at least the third time in recent weeks a function attended by Tamil Nadu governor has not had the National Anthem. In fact, itinerary of the Adyar Cancer Institute function on Thursday had allocated two minutes for singing the anthem. But, to the surprise of guests at the venue, the function came to an abrupt end with the governor walking away along with the prime minister.
 
 Though the central circular mandates singing or playing of National Anthem at official functions attended by the governor, it does not specify any penalty in case it is not complied with.
