PONDA/PANAJI:   zoo remained closed to visitors on the weekend for an unusual reason – miscreants force-released three leopards and a cub from their night shelter in the wee hours on Saturday.

 Zoo officials were taken by surprise as they found the shelter open at 6am with the locks broken. During the day, the   and their cubs laze around in the open, grassy enclosures and are guided in at night. “The zoo was closed to visitors on March 3 as a measure of safety,” a forest department press release stated. 
 
 Zoo officials found a male cub inside and after looking around traced two adults, Mandu and Anjali, within the premises. Another leopard,  , was also taken back into it safely by evening. A female cub has been spotted, but is evading the staff. “We expect her to return by night,” a source said
