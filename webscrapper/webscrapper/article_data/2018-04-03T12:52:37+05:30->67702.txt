WARDHA: The controversy over ‘baby swap’ episode, that had rocked   in   on February 24, was put to rest on March 31 after DNA test results confirmed the parentage of a baby girl.

 According to hospital sources, on February 24, Kalpana (name changed) from a village in   district delivered a baby girl. Another woman also delivered a baby boy on the same day in the hospital. Soon, the newborn girl had to be shifted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and the mother was shifted to maternity ward. 
 
 Two days later (on February 26), the nurses handed over the baby to the mother. The mother was shocked when she found a baby girl by her side. The woman and her husband argued that the hospital staff had made a mistake by handing over the ‘wrong’ baby as she had delivered a boy.
 
 The parents then lodged a complaint at Sewagram police station blaming the hospital authorities for handing over baby girl to them. 
 
 The authorities then decided to go for DNA test to determine the paternity. Accordingly, blood samples of the baby and her parents were sent for DNA test. The family chose to stay in the hospital till the results arrived. 
 
 It was only after the test result reached the hospital on March 31, staffers including gynaecologists and paediatricians heaved a sigh of relief as it confirmed that the doctors had not erred in handing over the babies to their respective mothers. “All along, the woman believed that she had delivered a baby boy,” the doctors said.
 
 The parents of the girl too accepted the DNA test findings and took the girl home.
 
 Dr  , head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology said, “I am happy that finally the truth prevailed and the test confirmed that we were right. Every year, our team delivers close to 5,000 babies in the hospital, and we take utmost care in handing over the babies to their parents. For decades, we have served the people with commitment. We shall continue to offer care to our patients.”
