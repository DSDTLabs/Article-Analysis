On May 5, 2018, Nasa’s InSight  , short for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, will rocket off to Mars. The $814 mission will analyse Mars’ interior to better understand the planet’s geophysics, unlike Nasa’s previous   missions which focused on finding water and confirming the planet’s habitability. Here's more:

 
 
 
 On Nov 26, InSight weighing 630 kg will land on Mars and spend two years on the  . 
 
 
 The landing site, a stretch of flat, uninterrupted land, will make it easier for the craft to study what’s beneath the surface. Mars shares similarities with Earth — both rocky planets — though it’s half as wide, one-ninth the mass and 30% less dense
 
 
 
 Rather than search for water like previous Mars rovers, including Curiosity, InSight will study the planet’s structure. In 2003, scientists found Mars likely has a partially molten core, explaining variations in its gravitational pull. But much is still unknown.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6.0 or 7.0 Possible magnitude of marsquakes, resulting from a cracking crust as the planet cools and shrinks 10-12. Scientists’ estimate of the number of quakes the craft will record over two years. Nasa hopes to chart enough marsquakes to generate a sonogram of the planet to precisely determine thickness of its crust.
 
 
 
 
 ) InSight will carry with it to Mars two satellites, seismometers and a heat probe.
 
 ) The seismometers will measure the intensity and frequency of marsquakes 
 
 The heat probe will dig 16 feet into the surface to measure temperature changes at different depths
 
  Highly precise communication systems on the craft will measure the wobble of Mars, which will allow Nasa to more accurately measure the diameter of the planet’s core.
