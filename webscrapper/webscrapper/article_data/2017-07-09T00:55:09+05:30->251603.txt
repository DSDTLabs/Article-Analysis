Coimbatore:   state organising secretary RS Bharathi said the state government has extended the tenure of director general of police (DGP) T K Rajendran for two years to close the Kodanad murder and dacoity case. He also said the party would file a petition against the government before the Madras high court for extending the tenure of DGP without following any legal formalities.

 Coimbatore urban north and south district DMK advocate wing has organised a workshop on people’s representative act, history of DMK and election rules at Kalpana marriage hall at Kavundampalayam in the city on Saturday. 
 
 DMK organising secretary and Rajya Sabha MP R S Bharathi in a press conference said the state would face legislative assembly and local body elections soon. “The ruling   party would misuse the power in the upcoming elections. Already, AIADMK had distributed crores of money to voters in RK Nagar bypoll. Subsequently, the poll was stopped by the election commission of India. To face the AIADMK’s money and muscle power, we have been providing training to our booth-level agents, party’s area secretaries. This would help them to approach the election officials when AIADMK is misusing its power,” Bharathi said.
 
 He said AIADMK has cheated DMK in the last assembly elections. “We lost our victory in 20 assembly constituencies in the last election. AIADMK did not allow the officials to count the postal ballets in Radhapuram assembly constituency in Tirunelveli district and DMK’s senior leader Appavu was declared ‘lost’ in the election. 
 
 Likewise, AIADMK misused its power in Kinathukadavu assembly election in Coimbatore district. Hereafter, our party workers have to work with caution and this workshop would help them to be cautions in the upcoming elections,” R S Bharathi said.
