The film is also special being it brings together the entire technical crew of Karvva together and they’ve been busy with this psychological thriller. Another reason for people to look forward to this film is because it will see V   in a negative role, something new for Sandalwood viewers. “It has been a great time working with Ravichandran sir. We’ve shot for around 30 days. I would say he is the most hard working guy on our film set,” says Rohith.
Quiz him about whether it was tough to get the   to agree for a negative role and he says, “As a fan of the star, him doing roles of a brother, father or guest appearances are not what I expect. And given that he is still an actor at heart, he is always willing to explore new roles. When I pitched this negative role to him, he said that he had wanted to do a negative role in a film that starred his son. He then added that since he considers me as his son too, he would do the role in my film. His fans will be please with this role.”
 Rohith also lets us in on the funda behind the unique spelling of the film’s title. “Buck and kaasu mean money. While sura is a good man. So, when a good man encounters a tryst with money, there’s a lot that happens. This is why the film is titled Buckaasura,” he says.
