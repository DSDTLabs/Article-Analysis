NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of the Delhi high court order seeking report on the status of   clinic project from all stakeholders by October 30, health minister   on Thursday said that the health department has identified 800 sites to build mohalla  . Jain said he has sought No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from the concerned departments and agencies to start building the mohalla clinics.

 “We had worked out a formula wherein on an average we wanted to have one mohalla clinic per kilometre. We then looked at the concept from the perspective of the municipal wards and planned for three to four mohalla clinics in each one of the 272 wards. That is how we had worked out that 1000 mohalla clinics are needed,” the   said. Delhi government has the intent but we don’t have the land, so we have asked the land owning agencies for NOC.”
 
 He pointed out that mohalla clinics are a basic civic amenity. “In case of building toilets too we are asking for NOCs from land owning agencies. As of now 158 mohalla clinics are functional, and now LG has given approval to the mohalla clinics concept as well,” he added. When asked if the land identification process had only picked up after the LG’s approval, Jain said identification had been going on for some time now.
 
 Jain also said that he was hopeful that now that the HC was monitoring the matter will move fast and NOCs will come through. He also said that the government will also work towards introducing biometrics based patient database along with other technological solutions to improve access of facilities and ensure a transparent system.
 
 The Delhi high court poser to Centre, Delhi government and the corporations came on a PIL alleging that lack of coordination between various agencies had delayed setting up of mohalla clinics and argued that it has deprived the poor of adequate health facility.
