JAIPUR: At a time, when   is looking forward to sign   (MoU) with   ( NHAI) to hand-over construction work of  , many farmers are gearing up to approach court against the settlement committee decision. 

 Last week, settlement committee constituted to resolve the Ring Road dispute amicably approved the claims of Rs 187 crore submitted by the Sanjose Supreme Tollways Development Private Ltd. 
 
 Ring Road Sangarsh Samiti alleged that instead of imposing penalty on the defaulter, the committee has allowed the awarded firm to walk freely. " It is serious misuse of public money. The committee has approved the claims of Rs 200 crore. However , it has not performed any work on ground. We would move to the court against the decision." said Virendra Ketwa , secretary of the samiti 
 
 He added , " No committee is authorised to resolve financial matters where public money is involved,"
 
 The JDA official , however , said the NHAI will pay the liability of Rs 221 crore to banks which was taken by Sanjose Supreme as loan to construct the 47-km Ring Road and no public money will be wasted. 
 
 "The draft of the MoU has been given approval. However, the decision of NHAI paying the liability of Rs 221 crore to banks will be taken after the committee recommendation receives approval ," an official said.
 
 As per the conditions of the agreement, which will be signed between NHAI and JDA, the highway authority will also provide Rs 350 crore to JDA in 10 years for commercial operation.
 
 It was announced that the project would be completed in 15 months. In June 2011, JDA had selected the joint venture of Sanjose Supreme as the final bidder for the Ring Road project. As per the contract, the awarded firm had to complete the work in 24 months. However, due to infighting in the company, the project stands stalled.
