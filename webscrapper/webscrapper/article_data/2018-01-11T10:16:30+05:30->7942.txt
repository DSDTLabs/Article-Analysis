HYDERABAD:   deputy floor leader in the state Assembly T Jeevan Reddy on Wednesday demanded that the KCR-led TRS government extend the Rs 4,000 per acre sop to tenant farmers as well and ensure that the welfare scheme is extended to every person or family engaged in agriculture in the state irrespective of whether they own land or not. 

 Stating that TRS government is showering love on farmers with an eye on 2019 polls, the Congress leader said that neither CM KCR nor his cabinet has done anything for the families of those farmers who have committed suicide.
 
 In a separate development, Congress MLA from Kodangal A   announced that the Congress party accepts the challenge thrown by TRS leaders for an open debate on the power scenario in Telangana. 
 
 "I will come along with party MLA Sampath Kumar and general secretary Dasoju Sravan on January 12 either to   or the venue to be decided by the ruling TRS leaders for a debate. This debate will expose who is lying,"   said.
