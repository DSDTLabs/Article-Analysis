HYDERABAD: Tragedy struck a labourer's family at Yellammma Banda in   on Saturday as a four-year-old girl died after a wall at an under-construction house collapsed on her. 

 P   was playing outside her home when the wall fell on her. She was the daughter of daily-wage workers from Narayankhed in   district. "The girl used to live with her parents in a room abutting the accident site. Construction of a house had been taken up near the room. As they were digging to lay foundation, the workers took out mud from the pit and stacked it along a wall, which buckled and collapsed on her," Kukatpally inspector   said. 
 
 He added that when the wall collapsed, a stone splinter sliced her throat, causing her instant death. Speaking to STOI, GHMC commissioner B   said the civic body would inspect the accident site soon. Police booked a case under section 304-A (causing death by rash or negligent act) of the IPC against property owner John.
