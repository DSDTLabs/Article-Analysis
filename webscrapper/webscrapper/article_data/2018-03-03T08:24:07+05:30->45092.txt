HYDERABAD: Revolutionary Writers Associations and human rights activists have demanded a judicial probe and registration of a murder case following the killing of 10 Maoists on Friday. 

 "The deceased may be militia members and adivasis. So far, the information given by both   and   police reveal that no top cadres are among the dead. The encounter may have taken place in Telangana side and cops shifted the bodies to Chhattisgarh side," revolutionary writer   alleged. He demanded a judicial probe into the encounter.
