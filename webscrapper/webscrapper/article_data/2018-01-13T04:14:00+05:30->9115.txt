Vadodara: The school strike call given by parents demanding earliest implementation of the Gujarat Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017 evoked mixed response. It was successful in schools with active parents associations while it received lukewarm response elsewhere. The Vadodara District Parents Association (VDPA) had declared its support to the state-wide strike call given by the All Gujarat Parents Association. Interestingly, a couple of schools in the city had declared Friday as a link holiday for Uttarayan festivities and these schools will remain closed till January 15. The Vadodara district education officer issued a cautionary circular asking the management of schools to give a patient hearing to parents. Despite agitated parents confronting school staffers at a couple of schools no untoward incident was reported. Parents paraded donkeys in the Manjalpur comparing school managements with the animal. They said that the managements were not willing to understand the act and the Gujarat high court were saying. Some schools in the city sent notes thanking parents for sending children to school and understanding the schoolsâ€™ point of view. Many school vans did not ferry children on the day and parents had to make their own arrangements. As many as 96 schools in seven districts of Vadodara zone submitted affidavits stating that they are ready to reduce fees in the range of Rs 2,000 to over Rs 10,000 before the Fee Regulation Committee (FRC). The FRC will now hold its second meeting on January 23 while it has decided to give a second chance to schools which have so far not submitted their proposals. The committee will conduct hearing of such schools on January 30 and January 31 as well as on February 5 and February 6.
