The Commander’s Cup race, that was held at the Lucknow Race Course, a couple of weeks ago, had several interesting events lined up. Apart from the horse races, the event also had a   performance by the Sikh Light Regimental Centre, Fatehgarh, a   dance performance and the Jhanj Patak performance by the Maratha Light Infantry troops.
