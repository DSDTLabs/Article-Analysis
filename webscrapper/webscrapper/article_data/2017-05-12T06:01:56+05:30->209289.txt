PUNE: A year after a devastating   through the   at  , the   (PCB) said it has made a number of ‘improvements’ to it. 

 A fire engine has been posted there and the PCB has brought in new firefighting equipment as the existing infrastructure was found to be inadequate.
 
 The Hadapsar site has been entangled in numerous legal battles, involving PCB, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), and many activist groups. Small fires at the site were also a regular occurrence, which is why local residents and activist groups wanted the site to be shut down, owing to “health and visibility” concerns, as the Pune Airport being not far from the site.
 
 A huge pile of garbage at the site, due to disputes over processing of waste, had earlier drawn the court’s censure. MPCB, and even former defence minister Manohar Parrikar who visited the site last year, criticised the same.
 
 PCB’s internal audit lists a number of upgrades at the site, such as the use of biochemical treatment to lessen the pile of garbage. Over the past year, it has revived a long-abandoned vermicomposting project at the site to specifically deal with biodegradable waste from various civilian markets in the area, like Shivaji market, Ghorpadi market, among others.
 
 While segregation at source is frequently mentioned as an effective waste management tactic, the PCB did not tread the path until recently, when it allowed rag pickers at the site to take away dry and mostly non-biodegradable waste from the site. Last month, it started a trial-run of professional waste segregation at source, and has engaged two NGOs to carry out the drive, in exchange of a subsidized user fee from residents.
 
 A key guideline from the Bombay high court and MPCB was to prepare a blueprint for a solid waste management plant at the site. While the PCB floated a proposal on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis, there is no clarity on when construction work will begin.
