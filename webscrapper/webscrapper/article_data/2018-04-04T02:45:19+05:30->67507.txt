NEW DELHI: The   pulled up Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) for   nearly   on the   of a proposed   at east Delhi’s  . The project never took off because the plan to construct a handicrafts bazaar included covering a portion of the Shahdara Link Drain, which was shot down by the National Green Tribunal. The report rapped DTTDC for the infructuous expenditure without seeking necessary clearances and ignoring rulings of the Supreme Court and competent bodies prohibiting covering of drains.

 “It was observed that in May 2012, DTTDC, on the suggestion of a member of Parliament, initiated a proposal to construct Dilli Haat by covering a portion of Shahdara link drain and had applied to DDA for change in land use,” said the report. In March, 2013, the irrigation and flood control department transferred 27,00 sqm of land at Shahdara Link drain to DTTDC on lease for 99 years.
 
 “Without waiting for permission for change of land use, DTTDC appointed three consultants for structural design, proof checking of structural design and architectural consultancy in June, August and September 2013 respectively,” says the CAG report.
 
 The judgment on an application with the NGT, filed in 2013 for stay in change in land use proceedings initiated by DDA, finally came in January 2015. By this time, DTTDC had already incurred an expenditure of Rs 39.66 lakh.
 
 The management replied in May, 2017 that there was no violation. “The approval for transfer of land for covering Shahdara Link Drain was accorded by the Delhi LG,’’ said DTTDC.
 
 The reply was not found acceptable in light of the fact that the LG approval letter for transfer of land stated that DTTDC should take up the issue of land use change with DDA on its own and also seek prior sanctions on all regulatory authorities prior to even putting up a temporary structure on the land.
