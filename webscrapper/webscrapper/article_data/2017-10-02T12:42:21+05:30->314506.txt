It’s not uncommon to spot traffic cops doling out challans to violators. But over the past year, there have also been instances where we’ve spotted them taking a more Gandhian approach instead of going the strict way. This Gandihigiri approach to check violators has seen city police giving flowers to violators, sharing important messages through small cards, stickers or greeting cards too. For instance, on the occasion of Rakshabandhan, the   distributed greeting cards to violators. “The cards contained an appeal to follow traffic rules as the person is very important to their family,” says  , Deputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic branch, Pune. 

 Formerly, this approach was limited to the first week of every new year, as part of safety week. But now, cops resort to the Gandhian approach at regular intervals. Before the Ganesh festival, city cops roped in dhol tasha pathak volunteers and did something unexpected. “The volunteers of the dhol tasha pathak not only spread messages through placards and banners but also distributed flowers to traffic violators,” Ashok added.
 
  
  
 Taking this to next level, the city police also came up with the ‘Selfie with Yamraj’ idea. “Yamraj depicts death. So a person dressed as Yamraj stood at various chowks in the city and stopped people from using their mobiles while driving, asking them, ‘Mazyabarobar Yayachay Ka?’(Do you want to come with me?). They also asked the violator to click a selfie with Yamraj and take an oath to follow traffic rules,” says the DCP.
