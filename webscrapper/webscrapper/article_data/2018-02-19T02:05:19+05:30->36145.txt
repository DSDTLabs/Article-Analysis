MUMBAI: A Bollywood make-up artist has been arrested for allegedly luring struggling models with work and soliciting them to customers in Bhayander. 

 The police, led by assistant superintendent   caught red-handed the woman make-up artist trying to seal a deal with customers. 
 
 The victims were two upcoming models trying their luck in the film industry. The victims, aged 26 and 27, had been promised a photo shoot at a resort in Uttan, Bhayander (west), on Saturday. The girls, who had come to Mumbai, with dreams of landing roles in films, were not aware that they were being readied for the   trade.
 
 The police sent decoy customers to nab the pimp. A deal was struck for Rs 1 lakh. Just when the models were about to be handed over to the decoy customers, the police raided the resort. The police have not ruled out a flesh trade racket with the make-up artist as the mastermind.
