NASHIK: Shiv Sena chief   avoided commenting on Maharashtra Navnirman Sena ( ), which ruled the   for past five years, and instead lashed out at the   leadership for inducting persons with criminal background into the partyfold. 

 The silence on the work of the MNS in the city during his half-an-hour speech raised eyebrows. Thackeray was addressing a rally here on Thursday evening in the runup to the civic polls slated on February 21. 
 
 “BJP has inducted many gooda elements in the party before the civic polls. It seems that the senior party leaders are encouraging entry of such elements in the party,” Uddhav said, adding that they have ensured that those taken into the Sena do not have any serious criminal cases. Taking an exception to the demands made by some BJP leaders that the publication of the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamna’ should be banned on some dates, Uddhav said that if the newspaper is banned it would tantamount to curbing freedom of speech. He described the newspaper as a weapon of the party. 
 
 The Sena chief said he would not think of withdrawing support to the BJP government in the state if the party announces loan waiver to the state’s farmers and provides them with interest-free loans. 
 
 “In the ongoing elections in Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi has made similar announcements. If the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis makes similar promise, then Sena will not think of withdrawing support from the government,” he said. He appealed to the voters to provide a chance to the party to come to power in the civic body. “Our main focus will be to work for the betterment of the city. We will also try to ameliorate the plight of the farmers,” he said.
