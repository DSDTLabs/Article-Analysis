The woman, who had gone to her paternal home after suffering domestic abuse at the hands of her husband, was killed as she refused to return to her husband. The deceased U Anandi, 18, was travelling with her mother N Kamala Veni, 38, to the   Government Hospital from Vellikuppanpalayam near Sirumugai to receive treatment for a head injury. “Her husband inflicted the injury a few days ago when he visited Anandi's home in Vellikuppanpalayam. He asked her to come back with him. However, she refused,“ said Mettupalayam Police. Fifteen days ago, Anandi's husband Udhayakumar had attacked her on her head. “He also attempted to murder her,“ police said.

 Whenever Anandi questioned Udhayakumar regarding his work, he would retaliate with violence. “Udhayakumar had the habit of gambling, playing marbles and drinking. Tired of her husband, Anandi left for her parents' home 20 days ago,“ said police. On Monday , Anandi and Kamala Veni boarded a bus to Vellikuppanpalayam at 9am. “After seeing the mother and daughter boarding the bus, Udhayakumar got into the bus. He asked Anandi to come home with him, but she refused again,“ said police.
 
 In response, Udhayakumar stabbed her, leaving her dead in a pool of blood inside the bus. The incident happened when the bus was nearing the Mettupalayam taluk office. Udhayakumar fled the location after the incident.
 
 Meanwhile, Anandi's body was taken to the Mettupalayam Government Hospital for postmortem and the body was handed over to the family in the evening. Police have registered a case of murder and are searching for Udhayakumar.
