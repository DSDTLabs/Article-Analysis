PUNE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to go cashless has inspired over 30 differently-abled students to do just that. 

  students of the Ahmednagar-based  , which has visual and speech and hearing-impaired students and the differently-abled, sought a workshop on e-payments, its secretary Ajit Kulkarni said. 
 
 A workshop on December 22 conducted by Vinayak Dhoot, a bank employee and an Anamprem alumnus, explained e-payments and a training session showed them the use of apps. Sixty-five students learned about  , Unified Payment Interface, and using debit and credit cards.
 
 “I am visually impaired and have been using e-payment apps for a year so I could explain it to them,” Dhoot told TOI. He also spoke about ‘Talking ATMs’ designed for the visually-impaired and the app to locate them.
 
 At least 32 students have started making payments through their e-wallets.
 
 Sambhaji Khilari, a student of New Arts College, started using Paytm after attending the workshop and found the app user-friendly. 
 
 “I used the app to make purchases on Flipkart and Amazon, and to buy daily essentials. It is similar to many other apps we use on our phones,” the visually-impaired youngster said.
 
 Khilari said extra care was needed while making payments. “I ensure that I have entered the right amount by listening in different languages. I also check more than once the account number of the person I am paying,” he said. For listening to security features like one-time passwords, he lowers the volume or wears earphones. 
 
 Kartik Pandav prefers e-wallets to talking ATMs. “We have become a part of the drive against black money and corruption,” Pandav said.
