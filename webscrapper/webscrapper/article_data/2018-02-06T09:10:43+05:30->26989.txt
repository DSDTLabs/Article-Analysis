NAGPUR: Lifting the ban on renewing   of the Rashtriya Koyla Khadan Mazdoor Sangh (RKKMS) for 2018, affiliated to the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has termed the Western Coalfields Limited ( ) management’s decision as “unjustified”. “Nobody has the right to allow one of the biggest unions to die,” the   observed. 

 The ruling was given by a bench of   and Justice Arun Digambar Upadhyay. Advocate Shirang Bhandarkar and his team appeared on behalf of the RKKMS.
 
 “There is a political agenda behind this and they want to make WCL ‘INTUC-free’. However, with the intervention of the HC, the management’s strange step against RKKMS has been nullified,” said   of the union Pradeep Kokas.
 
 According to WCL’s record, RKKMS has more than 20,000 members, comprising 40% of total membership from 84 mines across Vidarbha and parts of Madhya Pradesh. Barring the enrolment of its members would mean depriving them of their rights and challenging the constitutional status of RKKMS, which is a separate union registered under Trade Union Act, 1926, Kokas said.
