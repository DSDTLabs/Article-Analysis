NAGPUR: To educate people about   and how to avoid it,   organized an   titled ‘Accident-free Nagpur’ at its office on IT Park Road on Friday. Mayor   kicked off the drive. Senior inspector of Rana Pratap Nagar Police Station Shivajirao Gaikwad was the chief guest of the event. Brahmakumaris Sumitra and Kiran were also present on the dias.

 Appreciating the initiative of JSP, PI Gaikwad said, “Accidents happen due to human error. This error can be avoided is a person follows traffic rules properly. Every person should become selfish in protecting himself, one must think that rules are for me and my safety is most important. I will follow all the norms to protect myself, only then our society will be accident-free.”
 
 Comparing life with journey, Kiran said, “Life is a journey and every journey is desired to be happy. You are the driver of your life, so keep your mind stable and follow all the guidelines properly to reach your destination safely.”
 
 JSP’s Raju Wagh spoke about the plan which the NGO aims to undertake in next six months.
