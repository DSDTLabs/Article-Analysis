HUBBALLI: Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) will set up a continuous ambient   in Hubballi to keep a close watch on air quality and for timely intervention, if necessary.

 Vijay Kumar Kadakbhavi, district environmental officer, KSPCB, said the proposed centre will come up at Chitaguppi Park beside the   main building. “ The centre will come up at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore and the work will begin in couple of days,” he added.
 
 Kadakbhavi said an expert team from central pollution board has finalised the venue at Chitaguppi Park. 
 
 He said that board has plans to complete the civil works and installation of equipment by this month end. “ The centre will monitor the level of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide, ozone, PM 2.5, and PM10 in the air,” he added.
 
 At present there is only one such centre in the state and soon Mangaluru and Kalaburagi will have these centres. Currently, the districts have manual air quality monitoring centres. 
 
 “The proposed centre in Hubballi will be completely digital and people can know about the air quality round the clock,” a source in KSPCB added.
 
 Kadakbhavi said that a satellite-based digital display board will be installed tentatively at Brindavan Circle or K C Circle so that people can know the quality of the air.
