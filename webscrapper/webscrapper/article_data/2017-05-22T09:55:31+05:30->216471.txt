 A notice board put at the  , which bars politicians’ entry except Prime Minister, chief minister and deputy chief minister, is in the name of  . The authorities had never expected such a proclamation at Gorgam because its sarpanch Vinod Patel not only is a science graduate, but has also been associated with BJP since long. The black notice board reads ‘Public request- No politician should enter Gorgam village.’ However, it says Prime Minister, chief minister and deputy chief minister are welcome.
 
 “It is a clear instruction to politicians not to visit our village since it has been deprived of even basic infrastructure since the past so many years. We feel politicians just make promises and are not bothered about actual developmental work,” Patel said. The village, which has a population of 3,717, was facing severe drinking water problem in some parts. “Few areas of the village don’t get drinking water. Therefore, irrigation department has to provide water to the parched places from the reservoir. We have been asked to make a representation to the authorities in Gandhinagar for water supply,” Patel added.
 
 “Out of the 14km total road network in the village, nearly 6km has never been carpeted. Overall, the roads in Gorgam are in a bad shape. There is no development worth name here,” he said. Patel’s wife Tejal was sarpanch of the village from 2006 to 2011.
 
 “There are number of grants available under various projects to the gram panchayat to carry out development work in the village. It can claim grants for development work without interference from any department. I will have to inquire what the actual problem is and try to find a solution,” said Gaurang Makwana, district development officer, Valsad.
