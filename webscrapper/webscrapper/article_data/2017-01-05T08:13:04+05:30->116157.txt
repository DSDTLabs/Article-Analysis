PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Six days after Pimpri Chinchwad was included in the  , the municipal corporation has received official confirmation, commissioner   said on Wednesday. The civic chief said the proposal will be prepared and submitted to the state government soon. 

 On December 30, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis tweeted confirmation that Pimpri Chinchwad had been included in the mission. At the time, there was speculation that the tweet was a way to woo voters before the civic polls likely to be held in February.
 
 Waghmare said, “We have received a letter from the urban development ministry conveying that the city has been included in the Smart Cities Mission in place of Navi Mumbai. We have also been informed through the letter that Rs2 crore was allotted to Navi Mumbai to prepare the Smart City Proposal.   must get the amount transferred to prepare its own proposal.”
 
 However, the civic body will not wait for the funds. “We will appoint an agency to prepare the proposal soon and submit it for approval,” Waghmare said.
 
 The civic body will now form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to implement projects that will be approved under the mission. The state government will appoint a principal secretary-level officer as chairman of the SPV.
 
 “The union government will provide Rs500 crore while state government and PCMC will provide Rs250 crore, each, as grants over five years under the mission for various development works. The remaining amount will be raised through public private partnership (PPP), loans, or mutual funds,” said Waghmare. 
 
 Elaborating on projects to be included in the mission, Waghmare said, “Unlike the   National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), major flyovers, subways or roads will not be built under Smart Cities Mission. Instead, the funds will be used to improve basic services and make them more transparent and efficient.”
