GURUGRAM: There is hardly any lamppost and wall that has been left untouched by political parties in the city with the MCG polls just two days away. 

 Parties and candidates have put up   hoardings carrying political advertisements at every nook and corner of the city, defacing public properties. Yet, neither MCG nor the district authorities, who have been appointed by the state election commission to oversee the election processes, has taken any action, despite the rules being broken brazenly. 
 
 Not only have they lodged FIRs against defaulters, the authorities have not even issued notices to any of them. They admit that they are wary of taking action against anyone as it implies that they will have to pull down the   put up by the ruling party also, thereby inviting its wrath.
 
 “There are designated sites in each ward and the candidates are supposed to put up their posters or hoardings only at those sites. However, most candidates have put up their hoardings across their wards, and every day we remove close to 1,000 posters and hoardings. But they are back the very next day ,” said an MCG official.
 
 Returning officer   said he had asked the officials concerned to take action against the defaulters. “ I have asked assistant returning officers to take action against the offenders,” he said.
 
  spokesperson Raman Malik claimed the party had put up the least number of hoardings. BJP district president Bhupender Chauhan claimed candidates were directed to put up hoardings only in designated places. “Despite being asked not to put up hoardings at other sites, if our candidates continue to do so, the authorities should take strict action,” he said.
