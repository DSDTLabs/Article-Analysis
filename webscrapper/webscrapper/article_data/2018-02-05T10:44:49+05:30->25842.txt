NAGPUR: The local education department is taking no chances with gate crashers at an important meeting on Tuesday which education minister   is likely to attend. The deputy director of education (Nagpur division) has asked all education department employees attending the event to come with official identity cards or alternate government issued ones. 

 A source in the education department said, “We are expecting around 400 employees from neighbouring districts to attend the meeting scheduled to be held at a local school. A vernacular news channel misreported that all teachers and principals can attend the meeting which has led to a tricky situation.”
 
 Considering that there are over a lakh of teachers under Nagpur division's jurisdiction, the education department is a worried lot. The same official, said, “We can’t have people landing up either unknowingly or purposely. They can’t gatecrash especially with the minister being here. So, the IDs will help us to screen people coming into the hall. As it is, the seating capacity in that hall is just about enough to handle our invitees.”
 
 The meeting is basically for   to address education officials from six districts under the Nagpur division. The topic of discussion will be varied but one expects the minister to give a road map for his vision of school education in the state. 
 
 There was also confusion among education employees that bringing   card is compulsory. However, a senior education official clarified that it is just one of the options. “We want either the department ID or Pan Card or Aadhaar card to be carried by all education officials. This will help us establish their identities though we already have their names with us,” said the official. 
 
 While the local education department starts with the groundwork, the education minister’s trip to city is yet not confirmed. The minister’s office informed TOI that no final call has been taken on the visit that may see Tawde spending two days in city.
