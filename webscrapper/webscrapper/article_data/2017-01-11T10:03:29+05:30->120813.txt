CHANDRAPUR: A spotted dove was severely injured after getting entwined in coated   in Tukum here on Tuesday.

 After being rescued by a good Samaritan, avian activists rushed the dove for treatment. However, it is still uncertain whether the bird could fly after recovery. 
 
 Mushir Kureshi discovered the spotted dove that had fallen on the ground, desperately trying to hop away, near his residence. He rescued the bird and saw that its wings were severely damaged. Kureshi handed over the bird to avian activists Pintu Uike and Rahul Chilgirwar of NGO Habitat Conservation, who, in turn, took the dove for treatment.
 
 According to the organisation, the veterinary doctor upon inspection said the delicate bones on the doveâ€™s wing received severe injuries due to   used for flying kites. He treated the injured bird and asked to keep it under observation for a few days. 
 
 Avian activists have demanded strong action against manja sellers in the city. Despite being banned by the  , coated and nylon manja is openly sold in the market. They have demanded immediate action by the municipal corporation, forest and police departments.
