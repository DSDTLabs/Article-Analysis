THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:The state government has demanded the Centre to check the growing threat of fake news and rumour mongering through social media, chief minister Pinarayi   said here on Monday.

 During an interaction with editors from various media organizations, Vijayan said he had taken up the matter with Union home minister Rajnath Singh and sought central action against the menace.
 
 “The Centre can do a lot to contain campaigns meant to create communal tension through social media. We will do everything possible within the state's jurisdiction”, he said.
 
 Vijayan said his government has noticed deliberate attempts from certain quarters to malign the culture of communal harmony and tolerance in the state. “When a girl was brutally assaulted and killed in  , there was protest all over the country. There was protest in   too. But, some people tried to convert the protest to a riot. We later found out that those who assaulted the girl were responsible for diverting the protest here,” he added.
 
 The chief minister said during the first two years in power, the government changed the notion that nothing would happen in Kerala.
 
 “The paralysis in development was addressed effectively. The government is trying to rise and function according to the expectations of the public. We are also trying to create a political culture different from that witnessed during 2011-16 (the UDF rule). We could control corruption effectively”, he said. He reiterated the commitment to complete the NH development works within the specified time and said protests against the project were isolated.
 
 “GAIL project will be completed this year. From June, industrial areas in   and   will be provided natural gas,” he said. On the recent custody death, Vijayan said efforts were on to redefine training so as to provide police a human face.
