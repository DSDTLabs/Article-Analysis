Thane: Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s crackdown on the fuel scammers here is set to trigger action against unscrupulous fuel   operators in neighbouring   who are said to have purchased the equipment to manipulate the readings of the fuel dispensing machines from the arrested mastermind Prakash Nulkar.

 “Nulkar, who was picked up from Hubli early this week, has allegedly confessed to the crime and revealed the names and identities of his clients in Gujarat as well as Uttar Pradesh who sourced the technical knowhow from him. 
 
 “The Gujarat police officials visited us to understand the technology involved in the operation and how one could identify the fraud. They will soon check all the fuel stations there based on the information provided by Nulkar,” said a senior officer from Thane crime branch.
 
 The Thane crime branch had started raids on June 16. They had formed seven teams and raided in 16 districts in state. In the last one month they arrested 23 accused and till now no one have been granted bail.
