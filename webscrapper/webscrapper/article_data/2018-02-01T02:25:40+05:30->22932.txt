 Huda officials told TOI that the encroachers have been warned of strict steps if they returned to the plot. “We have told the encroachers to stay away from the land or else the department would file an FIR against them,” said estate officer-II Vivek Kalia adding that they are focusing on clearing Huda’s land from encroachers and many more such drives will be carried out in the coming weeks. 
 
 “We had asked the encroachers, a week ago, to vacate the land — which is a commercial belt of the sector — but they failed to comply with the order. Left with no option, we had to carry out the drive on Wednesday,” said SDO (survey)   adding that residents of nearby societies had raised the issue several times with the authority.
