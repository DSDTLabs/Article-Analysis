THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sunday's fire has proved that whatever steps the fire department has so far taken to make   and its crowded surroundings fire-proof have failed to materialize.

 Over a year ago, the department had submitted a proposal to set up a   near the temple, considering its importance. Approving this proposal, finance minister  , in his first budget presentation for the incumbent government, had announced a new   exclusively for the temple. However, works in this regard are yet to take off. According to sources in the department, failure of the temple administration in finding suitable land around the temple was the reason why the proposal is still remaining on paper. A fire safety audit was done nearly six months ago after a similar fire broke out in the store room of a leading  , located on the third floor of a building complex near the east gate of the temple. Then, the fire department had submitted the report to the district collector, corporation mayor and all other officials concerned, stressing the importance of educating people in the locality on how to prevent fire by ensuring quality of electrical wiring and appliances and also removing garbage promptly.
 
 Prevention was the only possible solution since total renovation of the buildings here, including heritage buildings, sounded impractical. But no effective awareness drive was held in this regard .
