INDORE: In order to improve   of the city under the smart city project,   (IMC) has planned to link the garbage collection system with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. The civic body also plans to install CCTV cameras at landfills and other garbage disposal sites. A total amount of Rs 1.3 crore will be spent on the project and the work has already begun.

 Officials said that with the new system, they can monitor locations of all  , including door-to-door collection and other bigger ones, that take garbage to trenching grounds and other temporary disposal grounds.
 
 “This will also help us save fuel. As soon as we receive information that a garbage bin is full, the vehicle nearest to the area will be sent there,” said  , additional commissioner, IMC.
 
 CCTV cameras at landfill and garbage disposal sites would keep a check on the amount of garbage entering the area in trucks and if they are disposed properly.
 
 Several companies have come up with a suggestion of app-based solutions for garbage disposal. According to their idea, a resident would be able to click pictures of garbage and upload it on the app. The pictures would also be tagged, mentioning the location. The server attached to the app would contain database and garbage picking vans would be immediately alerted.
 
 IMC is also planning to introduce the concept of smart garbage bins. The bin will have priority sensors that display a red signal if it is full. The bins would then automatically send signals to garbage vans. This would also save on fuel and time. Experts have also come up with ideas of segregating the waste and disposing them properly so that people living in the city do not face health hazards. Garbage collection vehicles would also be tracked and controlled from a centralised control room to ensure minimum fuel is wasted. The work to create a control room has already begun. The building is being constructed at Geeta Bhawan area at a cost of Rs 35 crore.
