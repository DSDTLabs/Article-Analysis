 The commission had recently got a summons served upon the SGPC chief Kirpal Singh Badungar asking him to appear before it on October 8. He had also been asked to bring along any documents related to the incidents of sacrilege and also of the pardon granted by the Akal Takht to the chief of Dera Sacha Sauda sect chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who is now serving a 20-year term in jail after being convicted of having raped two Sadhvis at his Dera. The commission had also summoned Akal Takht Jathedar (chief), Gurcharan Singh.

In April, the new government had set up a new commission under Justice Ranjit Singh, who is a former Judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court.
