GAYA: A racket involving purchase and administration of expired medicines to patients in different government hospitals, including the  , popularly known as   Hospital, was busted on Saturday. The expired medicines were found stored in central   store on the   premises. Storekeeper Abhay Sharma has been suspended and Dr   Singh, medical officer in-charge of the drug store, shifted from the hospital.

 District magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi said he ordered an inquiry after receiving complaints regarding administration of expired medicine to patients. “Expired medicines of 39 different types were recovered from the central drug store,” he added.
 
 Additional district magistrate Vijay Kumar has been asked to probe the racket. “A thorough inventory of the expired medicine is being prepared,” said the DM. Asked about the value of expired medicine, the DM said it would be known only after the completion of inquiry.
 
 On the likely crisis on account of the sealing of the central drug store and its impact on the public health system, civil surgeon Baban Kunwar said a mechanism has been put in place through which required medicine would be taken out in the presence of the magistrate with proper documentation of the batch number, quantity and the expiry date of such medicines.
