 Another video clip showed Virender being taken by the police team through a crowded market while naked. His wife and other family members had alleged that the cops denied the man to be allowed to put on clothes and also took him through a crowded route to parade him in public.
 
 “Humiliating a person, by parading him naked in full public view and in front of his family members is absolutely unethical and violation of his human rights,” the commission said.
 
 The police had defended the actions taken by the team, stating that the accused was taken as quickly as possible to the police van waiting outside the street and was given pant and shirt there before being taken to the police station.
 
 The cops had countered the family’s version by stating that the accused disrobed himself in order to create a situation, and instigate the neighbours and family members against the police team.
