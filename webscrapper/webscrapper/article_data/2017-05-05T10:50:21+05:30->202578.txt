PATNA:   of Class X and XII examinations conducted by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and the   (CBSE) are expected by the third week this month. 

 CISCE city coordinator and   directress Farhat Hasan said, “In 2016, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class X and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class XII results were declared on May 6, two weeks earlier than previous years. This year, the results are likely to be delayed as the exams started late due to assembly polls in some states. The results are most likely to be declared after May 14,” she said.
 
 CBSE city coordinator   said, “Despite the delay in exams, we are sure the results will be announced earlier than last year.”
 
 Bihar School Education Board, which faced lots of trouble in evaluation process, is likely to release the Class X and XII results by May-end.
 
 BSEB chairman   said, “The board will be done with the evaluation of intermediate and matriculation answer books within four days. Most of the districts have completed the evaluation work.”
