Gurgaon: Nearly eight months after the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) took charge of the upkeep of Sohna  , Public Works Department (PWD) has been made responsible again for its maintenance. Following a high-level meet last week, the   and   reached a conclusion over the ongoing upkeep row. The NHAI also allocated funds worth Rs 57 lakh for repairs on Tuesday.

 TOI reported about the ongoing tussle between the NHAI and PWD over the maintenance in the February 24 edition. 
 
 In July last year, NHAI took over the 46-km stretch between Rajiv Chowk and Sohna. However, in January, NHAI wrote to PWD that it would not be able to maintain the arterial route until it begins the elevated road project on the same road. PWD said it would not be able to repair and maintain the road due to lack of funds.
 
 Sohna Road is a part of Sohna-Alwar highway, an important route for Rajasthan and Haryana that witnesses vehicular movement of around 50,000 vehicles every day. It is also used for transportation of dairy products. While the NHAI proposed last year that the route would be turned into a four or six lane highway,   Road is in dire need of repair.
 
 The project is expected to start by August this year.
 
 “As per the decision taken during the high level meeting of PWD and NHAI at NHAI headquarters, two agencies cannot be responsible for the upkeep of the same road. It has been decided and conveyed to PWD that NHAI has taken up elevated road project as per directions of ministry of road transport and highways and routine maintenance would be done by PWD. The ministry has also provided funds to PWD for Improvement to Riding Quality and Periodic Renewal,” said Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI.
