Vadodara: At a time when the students of Faculty of Science of   (MSU) are spending more time in rectifying the mistakes in their hall tickets than preparing for exams, the faculty and university officials are blaming each other for the errors. 

 On Wednesday, when the students started printing their hall tickets for the exams which began on Thursday, they realized that the admit cards did not mention the foundation and elective subjects. Also, in many cases the subjects mentioned were incorrect.
 
 While the science faculty dean professor A C Sharma shot off a letter to the university’s registrar (exam) to probe the matter and get the issues rectified, the officials blamed the faculty for the subject selection at the time of admission and students for raising the issue at the last moment.
 
 In a clarification released by the MSU on Thursday, the university officials blamed faculty level admission committee, which selects the course for both semesters in the first year. MSU stated that because the students don’t check their selected courses on their respective e-Suvidha ID and raise the issue at the time of examination, such problems arise. 
 
 On Wednesday, Sharma had blamed the Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL) system that manages the student online life cycle but the university brushed off the claim and said that there are no error from digital university framework side. The second-semester students of first-year bachelor of science had a tough time ahead of their exam as they had to kept running between the university head office and faculty to get their hall tickets rectified.
