PATNA: Deputy CM   said on Wednesday the job   facility for scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST) and extremely backward class (EBCs) people would continue as atrocities on these sections have been refusing to reduce or end.

 “No political party can dare end the job reservation to the SCs, STs and EBCs. It will continue so long as atrocities on these sections continue to be practised,”   said, adding: “For the next 100 years, the   facility provided for them is unlikely to be reversed. Those who oppose it should explain why have social inequality and atrocities on them have continued to be practised.”
 
 Modi was addressing a function organized by the SC, ST forum of the   to celebrate the birth anniversary of   (or Ravidas). Union minister for social justice and empowerment   inaugurated the function and described the policies implemented by the   government for the welfare of the SC and ST sections. 
 
 Modi said both the Centre and the state government would separately move the   for the review of the order that had earlier abolished the reservation in promotion to higher posts facilitated for the SCs and STs.
 
 Modi said the state government would open 13 new residential schools for SC and ST children and upgrade the existing 48 residential middle schools to high schools. The official work in this regard has already started, he said.
 
 Modi said the problem with SCs and STs is that these people remain uninformed about the laws and provisions meant for their welfare and uplift. The law has provided that an SC/ST person would get Rs8.25 lakh in case of death in accident, a dalit girl/woman would similarly get Rs5 lakh in case of rape and a couple would get Rs2.5 lakh for intercaste marriage. “But potential beneficiaries remain deprived of the benefits because they don’t have information about these provisions,” Modi said.
