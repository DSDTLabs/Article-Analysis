Tirupur: The relatives of staff nurse R Manimala, who allegedly committed suicide due to ‘torture’ from two doctors, received her body after three days of protest at Kangeyam here on Wednesday.

 It followed after the directorate of public health and preventive medicine (DPH) transferred the two doctors, Dhamayandhi, Vellakoil primary health centre branch medical officer and Shakthi Akilaneswari, Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) scheme medical officer at the end of marathon peace talks.
 
 Manimala, 26, of Panruti in Cuddalore district was working as a nurse under the RBSK scheme in Vellakoil block for the past two years. She was staying in the government quarters along with another nurse. On Saturday, Manimala was found hanging in her room. Since then, her relatives and colleagues staged sit-in at the Kangeyam Government Hospital demanding to register a case against the doctors.
 
 “Though we demanded to register case against the doctors for their role in Manimala’s suicide, we withdrew the stir after the official transferred them and assured to take further action later. We received her body around 1.30am,” said S Devanathan, Manimala’s uncle.
 
 “The district administration has promised us that it would recommend the government to provide a job to Manimala’s elder brother on compassion ground,” said Devanathan.
 
 However, official sources said the possibility of getting the job would be very low because Manimala was not a permanent employee. “She had served for more than five years. It was the government’s fault not to regularise the job despite the lapse of the due,” Devanathan said. “The government has promised to provide compensation too,” he added. A DPH senior official said Dhamayandhi and Akilandeswari were transferred to PHC’s in Erode district and Dindigul district respectively.
