JALANDHAR: Accusing   chief minister   of making a false promise on loan waiver before polls and now waiving only a fraction of these, the Punjab unit of   has said that 312 farmers had committed suicide after the   came to power. The lists being displayed in the villages about these loan waivers has made it clear that these were meant only for cooperative societies, it added.

 Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Wednesday said that before the polls Amarinder had promised total loan waiver but he did not keep his promise. He also called upon the farmers to not allow Congress leaders to enter villages for leaving them in the lurch. 
 
 “Amarinder had appealed to Punjab farmers not to commit suicides as after coming to power their loans would be waived, but now most of them are being left out. This would rather create a more depressing situation for them as their hopes have been shattered,” Khaira maintained.
 
 Giving list of farmers from three villages of his constituency, he pointed out that these also included waiver of a loan of Rs 7,412 of   of Butala village. “They have included these small amounts which can be managed by farmers, just to add numbers to their total figures to mislead the people,” he said. Khaira alleged that as patwaris were involved in preparing the list, the revenue department officials could exploit the situation also.
