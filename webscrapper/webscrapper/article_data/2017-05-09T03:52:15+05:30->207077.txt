New Delhi: A petition was filed against chief minister Arvind   by a BJP member in Lokayukta on Monday based on the allegations levelled by former AAP minister  . The matter will be heard on Thursday.

 In the petition, Neeraj, a member of BJP’s legal cell, has asked the Lokayukta to order a detailed inquiry. “He (Mishra) has not levelled an allegation. He has said he was witness to bribe being taken by Kejriwal. His statement should be made the basis of the inquiry,” said Neeraj.
 
 BJP said the petition was filed on the direction of Delhi unit chief  .
 
 Reminding the CM about his stand on corruption, Tiwari pulled out an old tweet by Kejriwal in which he had said, “Shud people just resign for corruption or shud they be sent to jail for corruption?” Tagging the CM, Tiwari tweeted on Monday, “Either Jail or Resign please decide @ArvindKejriwal ji as being CM of Delhi you can decide for people of Delhi. Aap hi toh bole the!”
 
 BJP said AAP had always pushed for a lokpal to investigate corruption cases against public servants.
