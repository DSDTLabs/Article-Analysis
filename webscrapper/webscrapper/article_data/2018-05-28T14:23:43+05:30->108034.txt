SURAT: The   (ACB) will be extending its ongoing inquiry into the farm pond scam in Valsad to other districts in the state on receiving strong leads about similar irregularities having taken place there too.   had registered four complaints in Valsad about siphoning off farm pond grants through bogus claims. 

 
 Investigation in the farm pond scam that started from Gandhidham in   had revealed how lakhs of rupees were paid for farm ponds that existed only on paper. “We started identifying places where high amount of grant was utilized. Valsad was one of those areas. Preliminary inquiry findings matched our assumption that similar siphoning off funds had taken place in two other talukas of the district too,” ACB director Keshav Kumar said. 
 
 “In Valsad, we completed 90 per cent investigation before registering the complaint. We are now focusing on other districts of   where funds have been utilized but no work done on ground,” he added. The ACB received a number of applications informing it about similar racket in other districts after the scam was unearthed.
 
 “During inquiry, some persons involved in the scam started digging the pond. However, they dug it at some other location instead of the place mentioned in the records,” he added.
 
 Nine accused in four complaints were earlier booked at Valsad   station for siphoning off government grants to the tune of Rs31 lakh allocated for developing of farm ponds. Of the nine accused, police have arrested two. Their assets were now being searched by ACB. Police have asked four banks to seal the bank accounts and lockers of the accused and their family members.
