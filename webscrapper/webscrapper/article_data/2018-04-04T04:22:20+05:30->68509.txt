The results of the   (Std XII) examinations could be delayed as junior college teachers in the state, after evaluating the answer papers, are not forwarding them to the chief moderators in an attempt to force the state to accept their demands. 

 A senior officer from the Nashik divisional office of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education said that while more than 10 lakh answer papers were expected to reach the board's office by April, not a single one had come as of date.
 
  The chief moderators are expected to forward the papers to the board's office after getting them from the junior college teachers. As per the process, the papers are to be handed over to the board's technical department which prepares the   sheets. The results are usually announced around the end of May. 
 
 Prof  , general secretary of the State Junior College Teachers' Association, confirmed that the teachers had started this fresh  . " We will not hand over the papers to the next level till the government issues resolutions regarding the demands it has already accepted. We also want the education minister to take a positive decision on our pending demands," he said. After the teachers had called off their boycott of the evaluation process of the HSC papers last month, it was expected that the results would be declared on time.
