CHANDIGARH: Having been told to hold remedial classes for students, who got compartments in Classes X and XII exams, during summer  , teachers of several government   in the city opposed the UT education department's decision by holding a protest at the Rally Ground in Sector 25 on Thursday. 

 Teachers under the joint action committee (JAC) also met deputy director school education Saroj Mittal in this regard. Another Union - UT Cadre Education Employees Union - too held a meeting with the district education officer.
 
 On Wednesday, the department sent an email to schools, directing the teachers whose result is in the negative to "conduct remedial classes for compartmental students of Classes X and XII during summer vacation, so that their result can be improved." "The principal will also visit schools during the break to monitor the remedial classes," the email read further. Summer vacations will start from June 1 and till June 31.
 
 There were more than 100 teachers who took to streets, terming it to be an "unjustified decision" by the education department.
 
 They said they had already made holiday plans with their families. Union leaders approached the officers of education department either to withdraw the orders or grant earn leaves for days when they would have to teach students during summer vacations.
 
 It was decided that a delegation of JAC will meet the education secretary on Friday. The JAC has also called a meeting of teachers working in government schools in Chandigarh near Masjid Ground in Sector 20 to decide further course of action.
 
 Some teachers asked how the department would ensure that students are attending classes.
