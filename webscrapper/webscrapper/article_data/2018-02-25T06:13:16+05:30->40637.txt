BENGALURU:  , where   NA Haris’ son   assaulted Vidvat L on February 17, will remain closed until February

 27. Police, who have been keeping a strict vigil around UB City, have served a notice about it to the cafe owners.
 
 Cubbon Park police claimed the “crime scene” had to remain unadulterated for investigation and allowing business there would hamper the probe. “As both the injured and attackers are influential persons and the case is a high-profile one, we don’t want to take chances,” a police officer said, confirming that jurisdictional police have increased patrolling around UB City.
 
 
 The   police investigating the case said they’ve not made any fresh arrests and they haven’t been able to record Vidvat’s statement. “We asked doctors at Mallya Hospital about his condition to record his statement on Friday and they said his condition is stable not suitable to record it. We’ll do it when doctor allows us,” Ram Nivas Sepat, DCP (Crime-1), said.
