Ludhiana: Rajinder Singh, father of Kulwant Singh, 31, the data entry operator arrested in connection with the IT refund scam, has not slept since Wednesday. Rajinder is clueless as to why his son was arrested but vouches for his innocence. 

 His family members said his marriage was fixed for April 26. Rajinder said Kulwant did not know Ashish Aggarwal, the other accused who has been arrested.
 
 Rajinder said, “Kulwant returned from Delhi on Wednesday night. We have not been able to speak to him since then as income tax officials have called him for questioning. There is no way he can be involved in any wrongdoing as he is an honest person. My only request to authorities is that investigation be conducted in a fair manner so that the real culprit is found as my son can never do something like this. ”
