NAVI MUMBAI: The   have set their sights on a   land of over seven acres that has been reserved for a marina project by   (MMB) at sector 15 in Belapur and the surrounding green cover. 

 Currently, over 100 truckloads of debris have been dumped near the mangrove stretch along   creek and   in the last few days, alleged local residents. An illegal truck terminal has also come up where around 50 trucks and dumpers are already parked. 
 
 The Belapur jetty is located nearby. "This is a CRZ area. If the dumping activity remains unchecked, the dense mangroves will fall in the hands of debris dumpers," said environmentalist, Sukumar Killedar.
 
 The picturesque location is adjacent to Uran bridge and a stone's throw away from   headquarters.
 
 "This shows negligence on the part of Cidco, NMMC and the forest department that are supposed to safeguard this plot which has been reserved for the prestigious marina project," said activist Shriram Ghate. 
 
 Local MLA Manda Mhatre said, "I have sent the images of the terminal and dumped debris to Cidco MD who has assured of action."
 
 Bhushan Gagrani, Cidco MD said, "Our officials have been asked to initiate immediate action against the dumpers." 
 
 NMMC commissioner Ramaswami N said, "The solid waste management wing has been told to deploy the anti-debris squad to thwart such attempt. A trench has been dug up on Thursday at the entry point of the plot to stop debris-laden vehicles."
 
 Ganesh Zine, assistant controller of unauthorised construction, Cidco, said, "We will soon take action against the illegal truck terminal." Cidco superintending engineer Ramesh Giri said that the plot will be handed over to MMB soon for the construction of the marina. 
 
 A forest official said the area belongs to Cidco.
