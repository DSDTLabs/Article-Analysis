 The new bill proposes to not only regulate fees but also other charges and even donations to private primary, secondary and higher secondary schools.

Sources claim that the new law will mandate the formation of an autonomous authority to decide fees and charges for every school.
 
 “The government may disallow donations or allow a certain limit only. Schools violating the norms will have to face penal action, including cancellation of their school license,” says a senior official of the education department.
 
 A high-level consultation was held at Gandhinagar on Friday with parents groups, academic experts and private school representatives. The government also took suggestions and objections from stakeholders. The meeting was chaired by education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and attended by all key education department officials.
 
 An education official told TOI, “Fees charged by schools have to factor in inflation and be commensurate with services provided by the schools. Profiting from schools will not be allowed beyond certain limits.” The official added, “Once passed, the government will notify the law before the new academic session.”
