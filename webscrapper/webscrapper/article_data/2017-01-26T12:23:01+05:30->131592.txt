PATNA: The Padma awardees this Republic Day include Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati from   (Munger) and Baua Devi of Madhubani. While the 56-year-old Swami will be given   for excellence in yoga, 68-year-old Baua Devi will be honoured with   for her Madhubani paintings.

 Swami Niranjanananda, born at Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh, started taking yoga training at the reputed Munger institute of advanced studies in   when he was all of four years. He has been serving the institute as its ‘paramacharya’ since 1994.
 
 A disciple of Swami Satyanand Saraswati, founder of Satyanand School of Yoga, Swami Niranjanananda established Satyanand Yoga Ashram centres in Europe, Australia, North America and South America. He is fluent in English, Hindi, Spanish, French and other languages, and has also written books on yoga, tantra and the Upanishads.
 
 Baua Devi was born at Jitwarpur (Madhubani), and practised folk and ritual painting styles (earlier made on mud walls of houses). She shot to fame after the then   director, Pupul Jayakar in 1966 selected her for practising her art with modern techniques. Jayakar had put a group of such artistes under the care of master painter Bhaskar Kulkarni from Mumbai. 
 
 Her works range from paintings on small sheets to 16’-20’ canvas. Reacting to the 9/11 terror attacks in the US, she painted a skyscape occupied by a ‘naag’ writhing in pain and looking at a world full of bloodshed. She now lives in Delhi.
