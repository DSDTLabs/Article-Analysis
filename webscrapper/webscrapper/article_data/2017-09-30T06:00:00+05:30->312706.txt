It’s not such a happy   for   this year. The prospect of spending the festival wrapping up shooting of his next film,Vunnadhi Okate Zindagi in far away Italy has left the actor yearning for home. “Dasara is one big family celebration at my home. Invariably we end up catching up on the big release of the season every year with the entire family. I miss being at home. However, I’d like to wish the people of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana a very happy Dasara,” says Ram. 
Speaking about the film, he says, “Vunnadhi Okate Zindagi tells the story of a rock band comprising five friends played by Sree Vishnu, Priyadarshi, Kireeti, Kaushik and myself. But the major part of the story revolves around Sree Vishnu and me. A beautiful love story unfolds as the narrative traverses through three phases of their life — childhood, college and after.”
 
 
 
 
 Sree Vishnu plays Vasu, while the female leads   and   play Meghna aka Maggie and Maha, respectively. “Anupama has done a fabulous job. Her role, Maha is a challenging one and takes a lot of guts to pull it off. She was a revelation. Lavanya’s character can be summed up with her punch dialogue: “Are you ready? Maggie ikkada 2 minutes lo ready ayipotha”. 
 The actor is thrilled to be part of the film. “I felt like a different person while enacting the role of Abhiram, the frontman of the rock band. I think it will take me to another level. I’ve watched the film and I can say with all sincerity that I’ve got what I wanted from the film.” 
  is being produced by Sravanthi Ravi Kishore and Krishna Chaitanya under Sravanthi Cinematics in association with PR Movies. The film is all set for release on October 27,2017.
