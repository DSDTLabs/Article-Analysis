Bicholim: Residents of Karapur-Sarvan village panchayat compelled the panchayat body to suspend the gramsabha midway through proceedings as the panchayat failed to pass resolutions regarding development due to enforcement of code of conduct for the byelections in Panaji and Valpoi constituencies.

 The gramsabha began under sarpanch Ramesh Sawant and villagers raised up issues. However, panchayat secretary Mahadev Naik informed them that resolutions regarding development works could not be passed and other issues could not be raised due to enforcement of code of conduct. 
 
 Following his reply, a villager, Chimaji Munji, said that there was no need to conduct a gramsabha and discuss issues if the resolutions could not be passed. Other villagers also supported him and the gramsabha was suspended. Panchayat secretary Mahadev Naik said that he would put the matter before the block development officer to take appropriate steps.
 
 Other issues discussed were parking of heavy vehicles along the roadside near Karapur-Tisk junction causing blockage to traffic, obstruction of traffic by stray cattle and danger posed to the lives of fish vendors who sit along the roadside. Te panchayat was asked to check whether the NOC issued to Green Acres company was legal or not.
