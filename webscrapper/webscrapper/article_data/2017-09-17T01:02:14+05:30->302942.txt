NEW DELHI: An   aircraft was   by a   on Friday night while it was taxiing after landing at the IGI airport. No one sustained any injuries in the incident, an airline source said.

 Airport officials said the incident took place around 9.45pm when Air India flight AI 820 from Vadodara was taxing after landing at runway 29/11. 
 
 “While coming into the bay, engine number 1 of the aircraft, on the outboard side, hit a parked ground-cooling unit at bay C33,” said an official.
 
 Initial probe revealed that a cooling unit (generator vehicle) was parked near the right engine of the plane. When the unit started to supply cooling, vibrations caused it to move as the stopper was improperly placed and it went and hit the right-side engine.
 
 The ground cooling units are generally used to maintain temperatures inside the   by providing both cold and hot air.
 
 An Air India spokesperson said that the matter was being investigated by them and the regulatory bodies. DGCA is also probing the incident, officials added.
 
 “Air India management has constituted a two-member committee to investigate the incident. The committee will submit the report within seven days,” said the Air India spokesperson 
 
 A similar incident occurred last month when the wing of an   aircraft hit a parked Air India aircraft at bay 87 while the plane was being pushed back. The flight was carrying 196 passengers and crew members. No injuries were, however, reported.
