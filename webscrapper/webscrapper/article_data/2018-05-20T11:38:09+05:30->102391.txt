When in doubt, they say, turn to God. In   Banerjee’s case, it has happened more naturally with Uma. As she gears up for her career’s biggest release, there are many things that need her attention — a cracked friendship, a ruined relationship and a broken bond with her mentor. Once Nusrat’s ‘bonu’, Sayantika had moved away from the actress following a clash of interests between her then beau and Nusrat’s better half. She eventually broke up with her man, who was rendered jobless after his small-screen venture went off air. Sayantika, who had already shot for Srijit Mukherji’s film when things came to a head, was temporarily upset by her mentor’s behaviour, as he chose   over her as far as films that he helmed were concerned. But now, as   nears its release, Sayantika seems to have let bygones be bygones. Joy, her ex-boyfriend, is no more a part of her life and she has managed to mend her professional ties with her mentor ahead of the film’s release. The only grey area remains Nusrat, with whom she is yet to complete one film. I hear Rajib is tired of coming up with excuses for not wrapping up his movie starring Shakib Khan, Sayantika and Nusrat for more than a year now. He apparently reasoned that there were issues about procuring the rights to Nagarjuna’s Telugu superhit, Mass, on which the film is based, and added that the delay in the shoot made Shakib opt for another movie, Bhaijaan Elo Re. Though the two leading ladies do not share screen space in the film as one is a human and another, a ghost, none gave dates after their big showdown. Now, the director has vouched to shoot fight scenes with them separately and complete the movie. Looks like he will have to fight for that too.
