AGRA: Union   for railways   on Friday said that implementation of law and order in UP was the prime concern of both the state and central governments.
 Sinha, who was in Agra to present the report card on PM Narendra Modi’s three years in office, said, “During the last 15 years, the law and order situation in UP was in shambles. We will ensure that no criminal is given protection.”
 
  On the issue of surgical strikes against Pakistan, he said although the government cannot disclose how many enemies are being killed, “we will ensure that nota a single inch of land in J&K will be given to the enemy”.
 
  Sinha said, “We are following a policy of   for terrorists and intruders. We cannot disclose everything and cannot tell every day how many (terrorists) we are killing. I can assure you that every inch of J&K belongs to India and will continue to remain with India forever. We are committed to giving a befitting reply to our neighbour if it indulges in nefarious activities.”
  
  The minister denied that a move to do away with Article 370 which grants special status to J&K was ever part of BJP’s manifesto. “In our election manifesto we never said that we will remove Article 370,” he said.
  
  Sinha admitted that more cases of railway accidents had been reported in recent times. “The ministry is concerned about the issue and is trying to find solutions,” he said.
  
  The minister said that during the last three years, around Rs 422 crore have been spent in Agra and adjoining areas to improve railways facilities. “A bridge on Yamuna is being built at a cost of Rs 107 crore, even as Rs 699 crore are being spent to complete the 40-km track between Mathura and Palwal,” he said.
