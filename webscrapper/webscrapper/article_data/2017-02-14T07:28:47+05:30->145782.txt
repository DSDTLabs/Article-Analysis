KOLKATA: The   on Monday admonished a person and his wife for torturing his mother and denying her the share of the house his father had left behind. While directing   to give protection to the mother, now staying at her daughter's place,   held that a son living in his mother's place has to live there on the mother's terms, and not his own.
Santi Modak, now a widow, was staying with her son Santanu and daughter-in-law at a Baguiati house that her husaband had built. Trouble began two years ago, when the son insisted on handing over the property to a developer. An agreement was signed whereby the mother was to get a flat, the son another, while a third one was to remain with the mother. Soon, however, the son started putting pressure on the widow over the third flat and allegedly tortured her. Santi left the house and filed a police complaint.
