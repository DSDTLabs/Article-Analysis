KOCHI: Vishwa Adluri, a philosopher and Indologist, while drawing a connection between the Kochi-Muziris   (KMB) and the epic Mahabharata, said that the fourth century epic attributes artistic value to everything. 

 “Earlier, art was classified into genres such as painting, sculpture, poetry or music. However, when everyday objects entered the gallery space or an art show, it posed the question of ‘what is art?’ While the West said art could be anything, the Mahabharata held that art was everything,” said Adluri over the course of a lecture titled ‘Universe in Verse – Mahabharata as Contemporary Art’ at the pavilion in   on Wednesday.
 
 Adluri drew a parallel between the title of Sudarshan Shetty’s curatorial vision for KMB 2016, ‘Forming in the pupil of an eye’, and a reference in the Mahabharata, which is told at the end of story in a forest called ‘Naimisharanya’ or ‘a blink of an eye’.
 
 “In telling the Vedic idea of a sage transmitting several multiplicities through the eye, Sudarshan uses the ‘blink of an eye’ concept, which is ‘Nimisha’ when translated into Sanskrit. The whole story of Mahabharata happens in a forest named ‘Naimisha’. So we can call it the ‘Forest of a blink of an eye’. The Mahabharata is an art object in itself,” he said.
 
 “A verse in the epic says ‘whatever we find here, can be found elsewhere. But what is not here can be found nowhere else’. This is a pretty dramatic statement that can be interpreted to relate the Mahabharata with an art space like the Biennale. That nothing is outside the Mahabharata is a very vital statement for art,” Adluri said.
 
 The author also related some of the concepts mentioned in the epic with a number of artworks featured at KMB 2016. “For example, time and universe are two concepts in the epic. Here at the Biennale, two works in particular depict these themes – Raúl Zurita’s ‘Sea of Pain’ and Aleš Šteger’s ‘The Pyramid of Exiled Poets’,” Adluri said.
