Mumbai: As Western Railway on Sunday made   payments to the injured and families of deceased of the Elphinstone Road stampede, in which 23 people died on September 29, Ritesh Rathod, a survivor, claimed some patients were angry with   for asking them to procure   from outside.

 Vikas Javirkar, whose sister Pratibha underwent a surgery for facial injuries suffered during the stampede, had to pay Rs800-900 for medicines from a private pharmacy. The family, however, said they did not complain as it was a small amount.

 Around 30 victims with simple injuries were paid Rs50,000 each. Railways earmarked Rs 1.33 crore for the accident victims.
 
 The state government too will pay Rs 5 lakh each to the families of those dead. This is besides payments from the railway claims tribunal.
