CHENNAI: Allowing a trademark suit moved by  , Chennai, the Madras high court has directed Andhra Pradesh-based Sri Sai Apollo   to desist from using the mark ‘Apollo’ in any manner.

 While allowing the suit,   also refused to grant Rs 25 lakh damages claimed by Apollo for the trademark infringement.
 
 “At present, no evidence has been let in to show quantification of damages of Rs 25 lakh and therefore, that limb of the prayer is not acceded to,” Justice Sundar said, while making it clear that Apollo is at liberty to move a separate application for damages based on the present order.
 
 According to Apollo, they have rights over 12 different trademarks in seven different classes with the mark ‘Apollo’.
 
  Claiming that the defendant should not use the said trademark either independently or in association with other words, such as ‘Sri Sai’, Apollo approached the high court.
 
 They also submitted that they had spent a considerable amount of money and put in enormous effort and time in developing the unique design for their products under the said trademarks, and hence the defendant cannot be allowed to infringe their right.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, relying on the material evidences produced by Apollo, the court allowed the suit and asked the pharmacy to desist from using the mark.
