GULALI, KANPUR DEHAT: A woman’s charred body was found in a ‘Holika’ in   on Friday morning. It was sent for postmortem after preliminary investigation.

 “She used to sit still and meditate for hours on the roof of our house, and apparently did the same on the day of ‘Holika dahan’,” said Shrinath Singh (70), father of Seema whose body was found in   in Gulauli village under Musanagar police station in Kanpur Dehat.
 
 “Seema, mother of four children, dressed in wedding finery, left home with a ‘diya’ saying that she was going to attend ‘Holika Dahan’ rituals, but went missing. We launched a frantic search for her, but in vain,” said Seema’s sibling Amitendra. “Seema often used to dress up as ‘Holika’. At times, she even addressed herself as ‘Holika’, but we had no inkling that she will resort to such extreme step. Had she exhibited some kind of suicidal tendency, we wouldn’t have let her venture out,” he added. “Some early risers noticed the stench of burning flesh emanating from ‘Holika’ on Friday and alerted police,” said Munnu, a villager. “When wood was cleared, we saw a burnt body and pulled it aside. It was beyond recognition. Seema’s family identified it from her bangles and ornaments,” said SHO Musanagar.
 
 “A case was registered in Musanagar police station and we are questioning her kin. We are working on every possible angle,” said SP Ratan Kant Pandey.
 
 Forensic experts collected samples and dispatched them for further analysis. “Though her family claims that she left home for   no one saw her sitting or loitering near Holika,” said Raghav. Locals said that though Seema was mentally unstable, but her behaviour was quite normal. “She never harmed anyone. She was as calm as a Goddess,” said Sujit, a local.
