HYDERABAD: Telangana’s dream of housing an   ( ) got a shot in the arm on Friday with the government of India (GoI) granting an in-principle approval for the prestigious medical institution to come up in Hyderabad.

 The Hyderabad AIIMS is proposed to be housed on a 200-acre campus at   on the outskirts of the city and a team from the Centre will soon be visiting the city to inspect the site.
 
 Apart from AIIMS, two new medical colleges — one in Mahbubnagar and the other in Siddipet — were also approved by GoI, whereas two other colleges proposed at Nalgonda and Suryapet are still in the pipeline.
 
 “GoI has given in-principle approval for AIIMS in Telangana. This will be a boon for medical education and healthcare delivery. AIIMS and the other two medical colleges will help the state provide quality medical services to the people of Telangana,” said state health minister C Laxma Reddy, adding that the TRS government had successfully got approvals for the establishment of five prestigious medical institutes in its tenure.
 
 The Rs 840-crore AIIMS project will have a 960-bed capacity hospital along with a 100-seat medical college and is expected to offer 42 super specialty services to the people of Telangana. It will have basic science departments like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, community medicine, and forensic medicine along with other departments like physical medicine & rehabilitation (PMR) as well as ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha & homoeopathy (AYUSH) facilities.
 
 While the state government had identified 200-acre sites in Hyderabad, RR, Nalgonda and Warangal, it was Centre’s demand that the institution should come up near the city so that it can cater to the needs of over one crore people, including patients from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh who regularly come to Hyderabad for medical treatment. AIIMS was sanctioned under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana.
