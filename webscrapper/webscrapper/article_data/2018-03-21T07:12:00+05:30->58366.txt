NOIDA: The district administration has fined three restaurants for violation of the Cigarettes & Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) after they were found to be violating the rules of a designated smoking room.

 The district   in Noida, along with a police team, carried out an enforcement drive on Monday and zeroed in on three places — Jokers, Turquoise Cottage Café and Titos — in Garden Galleria in Sector 38 A.
 
 “These places encourage smoking, as ashtrays were kept on all tables,” said a statement from the district tobacco cell. Earlier ADM, City, GB Nagar issued the order for enforcement of provisions of DSA which include that ashtrays cannot be present in the eating zone. A total of Rs 5,400 were collected from the three restaurants,” said an official of the district tobacco cell.
 
 According to the new rules, no eatable or drink can be served in a smoking area which has to be a separate four-walled enclosure with proper ventilation. It has to have an entrance with automatically closing doors normally kept in close position.
 
 Sonam Kapoor, owner of Jokers, told TOI that they were unaware of the new rules and hence have kept ashtrays on every table in the outer area where people can smoke.
 
 Vijay Chaudhary, manager of Turquoise Cottage, said they do not allow cigarettes to be sold in their premises and will check on the new rules of the designated smoking zones.
 
 Ajit Sharma, the manager of Titos said that the ashtrays were found in the eating zone in the morning when no person usually comes at the bar. “We are aware of the guidelines but the ashtrays were placed by some person new to the business.”
