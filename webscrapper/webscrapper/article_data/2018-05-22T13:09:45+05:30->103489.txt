Actor   of 'Y.A.R.O Ka Tashan' fame, was in Lucknow for an event, recently. The actor, who first visited Lucknow nearly a decade ago, calls the city his second home for the number of times he's visited here. "Visiting Lucknow has always been very special to me as my last film was shot here extensively," said Aniruddh, adding, "We shot at places like Malihabaad, Kukrail picnic spot. Har hafte ya mahine, mera yahaan aana hota hai and the best part of every visit is  . Be it the   or shopping at some of my favourite places in Hazratganj, I love to be in this city."
"Lucknow, over the years, has become a shooting hub with more and more films being shot here every year. The state government has given a great opportunity to filmmakers by giving them subsidy. I too am looking forward to more opportunities for shooting in a great city like Lucknow," said Aniruddh, who shot for a film in the city for nearly a month last year. "I had come to Lucknow ages ago for theatre grooming classes at  . The first time I saw Lucknow, I was in love with the place and its culture. I give Lucknow full credits for instilling the love for theatre in me," added the ' ' actor.
 Dabbling in theatre, TV and films, Aniruddh feels that an actor should not be concerned about the size of the screen, instead he should focus on the content and the character. "It's very confusing to figure out what is more important for the growth of an actor, is it the medium or the content. I feel everything is important for an actor to flourish. I basically look forward to good scripts because if the script is good, then automatically the character will also be good," said Aniruddh.
