There have been instances of actors being unrecognisable after their extensive makeover for films. In   and her brother Siddhanth’s case, things went a bit too far — the siblings went unrecognised by their mother   when she visited them on the set of 'Haseena Parkar'. Apporva Lakhia, who has directed the biopic based on underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s sister, says, “It was quite funny when Shivangi came on set and could not recognise   and   who were right in front of her. When she finally saw them, she was quite surprised and for us it was a great moment because the authenticity of the look and transformation was appreciated in this way.”
