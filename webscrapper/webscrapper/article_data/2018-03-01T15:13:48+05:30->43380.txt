 Inspector of police T Santhalingam, who is the investigation officer for the case, ruled out the possibility of any foul play in Sathya’s death saying, “It was a clear case of suicide.” 
  
 Preliminary inquiries revealed that Sampath was a drunkard who suspected his wife of infidelity and often beat her up. 
  
 In the video which started doing the rounds on Tuesday, the woman is seen bleeding from injuries to her face and neck. She stated that her husband Sampath had been subjecting her to torture. 
  
 “Though I had approached the police and lodged a complaint, they pacified me and asked me to go back to my husband. After that, he locked me up inside the house and I am starving. He has threatened to kill me if I speak of the   to anyone,” Sathya is seen as saying in the video. 
  
 The video was taken two months ago and was being circulated by one of her relatives after her death, explained the inspector. 
  
 A complaint from the victim or from her relatives had not reached them in the last one year, the inspector clarified, when asked why they failed to take action on her complaint.
