NAGPUR: The purity of swara, the melodious beauty of raga Multani and the serene calm of Dhrupad gaayaki marked the second day of ongoing Anubhooti cultural festival. At Deshpande hall on Friday evening, the audience got to experience the richness of this ancient genre of Hindustani classical music by none other than the maestro of Dhrupad singing, Pt Uday Bhawalkar.

 Dhrupad gayaaki is mostly religious in temperament with its origins traced back to Saam Veda. It was thus appropriate that the presentation came on the day when Mahashivratri was being celebrated. Striking the mood was Pt Bhawalkar, the most famous disciple of   (vocal) and Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar (Rudra Veena) and his disciple   and Pratap Awad on pakhawaj.
 
 One of the foremost Dhrupad vocalists, Bhawalkar has often been credited with the resurgence and growing popularity of this form. 
 
 He showed his mastery over the genre at the concert when he connected with the audience through the deep resonance of his robust swar, their tonal quality, as there are no words in Dhrupad gayaaki, and weaved magic with his vocals even as his fingers moved in the air as if to paint a musical picture. He followed the presentation with Shivpanchakshari stotras by Sankaracharya.
 
 The second performance of the day was by Pt   who has been a regular performer at the festival for the past three years.
 
  “The concept of this festival is very nice as it captures the best of all cultural genres. Being from Vidarbha region, I am specially happy as it has brought a revival of classical music in the city,” he told TOI ahead of his performance.
 
 On day three of the festival, Mahesh Elkunchwar’s Marathi play ‘Magna Talyakathi’ will be staged at Deshpande hall at 6pm. This will be the first show of the play in the city.
