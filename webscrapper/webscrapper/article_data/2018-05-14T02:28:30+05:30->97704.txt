AHMEDABAD: A   family was barred by upper caste Darbar community members from performing post-wedding rituals at a temple in Golagam village in Gujrat's   on Sunday as they added the suffix ' ' to the names of two children on the wedding invitation card, something that   consider as their community's prerogative.

 
 The family, which had to hold their marriage under police protection, faced stone pelting from Darbars at the temple, and the groom was hit by a stone, according to locals. The head of the Dalit family, Kanji Bhadru, a cop in Banaskantha, had received several threatening calls earlier.
 
 On the basis of his FIR, two accused were arrested. "Darbars got into arguments with the family and pelted stones. They broke the pitchers from which our kids drank water in the temple," Bhadru said.
