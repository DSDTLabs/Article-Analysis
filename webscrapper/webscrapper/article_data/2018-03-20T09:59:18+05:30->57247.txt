 Even as the family struggles to come to terms with the loss, Kavitha’s husband  , a businessman, has been going around, advising two-wheeler riders to wear helmets.
 
 “People who think wearing a helmet is hard, our life is a classic example. had my wife worn a helmet that day, my children wouldn’t have lost their mother,” he said.
 
 Kavitha’s kin recalled her as a jovial woman who was very generous. After her death, Kavitha’s family donated her skin and eyes. “It is unfortunate that we lost her, but the donation was her way of giving something back to the society,” said Sripal.
