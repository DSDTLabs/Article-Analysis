 The   also called this a balanced budget saying that the focus on infrastructure development and agriculture would provide a huge boost to employment in the state. "What is also commendable is that the government has focused on sub sectors within agriculture like fisheries etc," said  , co-chairperson of the UP chapter.
 
 However, political commentator  , who also contested UP assembly elections on SP ticket, said that the budget was aimed at an election with no real development agenda.
