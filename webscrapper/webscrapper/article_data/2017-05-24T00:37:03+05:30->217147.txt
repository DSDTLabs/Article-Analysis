Pune: City-based facility management company Bharat Vikas Group (BVG) will foray into the   housing segment and plans to build over 10,000 houses over the next three years.

 The company said the houses, intended at low-income households, will not be over 500sqft. Each unit will be priced under Rs 3,000/sqft in Hinjewadi and under Rs 2,200/sqft in Shindewadi.
