NEW DELHI:   chief   on Thursday attacked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government by recounting the "leaks" that had taken place during its tenure.

 
  
  
 (How many leaks? Data leak! Aadhaar leak! SSC exam leak! Election date leak! CBSE papers leak! There is a leak in everything, the watchdog is weak)
 
 The CBSE yesterday announced re-tests of the Class 10 Mathematics and Class 12 Economics exams following reports that the papers were leaked.
 
 The government launched a probe amid student anger over the issue.
 
 PM Modi, too, expressed unhappiness over the development and sought strict action from HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.
 
 In another "leak"-related development, the Election Commission (EC) constituted a committee of six officials to probe how information on the   was leaked on Tuesday.
 
 The committee was set up hours after  's IT cell chief Amit Malviya and Karnataka Congress IT head Srivatsa simultaneously tweeted out the dates for the Karnataka Assembly polls, even before Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat had announced the dates. Incidentally, while both got the polling date correct, they got the date of counting wrong.
 
 A Kannada news channel also flashed the dates before the EC's announcement.
